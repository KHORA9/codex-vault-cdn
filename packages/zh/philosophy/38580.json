Linnell, PhD (2011)\r\n\r\nA comment on the title : due to the nature of Chinese, the title could\r\nmean any of the following : \"Belief in (the) Mind\", \"The Believing Mind\",\r\n\"Trust in (the) Mind\", \"Trusting Mind\", \"True Mind\", \"Truthful Mind\",\r\n\"Faith in (the) Mind\", or \"Faithful Mind\", and indeed many of these have\r\nbeen used by other translators (most often \"Faith in Mind\"). I chose\r\n\"True Mind\" because the entire inscription discusses how to get back to\r\nthe original Buddha nature we all have (but have forgotten), and the\r\nphrase \"true mind\" (in English, not the particular Chinese symbols in the\r\ntitle of the document) is often used synonymously with this Buddha nature,\r\nBuddha mind, True Nature, Original Nature, etc.\r\n\r\nMy goals were to include every Chinese symbol in the English sentence,\r\nusing an exact translation of each symbol, and with minimal additional\r\nwords and paraphrasing. This results in sentences which are sometimes\r\nstilted in English, but hopefully provides a more literal translation.\r\nInterpreted meanings are as close to the exact meaning as possible.\r\nExceptions to these guidelines are marked with footnotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions of Terms\r\n--------------------\r\nBeing : existence\r\nEmptiness : negation of the belief in Being and non-Being\r\nAwake, wise : enlightened\r\nFoolish : not awake; unenlightened\r\nHeart/mind : the Chinese symbol means both \"heart\" and \"mind\"; it seems\r\n             misleading to use one or the other\r\nSuchness : that which is constant and genuine; the true nature of things;\r\n           reality-as-it-is; things just as they are\r\nThe Way, this wisdom : Buddha's way - the four noble truths, eightfold\r\n                       path, etc.\r\nEntanglements : sensory pleasures, preferences, desires, aversions, love,\r\n                hate, etc. (literally \"conditions\")\r\nNaturally, spontaneously : done by itself, that which is so of itself,\r\n                           done on its own, happens without forcing it\r\nThings : the external world; objects, people, creatures, events\r\nCease to be, rejected, forgotten, eliminated, fade away :\r\n   leave your awareness, no longer influence you\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\nAttaining the Way is not difficult,\r\nIf only you dislike picking and choosing.\r\nOnly when you do not \"hate\" and \"love\"\r\nWill the Way thus be clearly and plainly revealed.\r\n\r\nIf there exists the smallest distinction,\r\nHeaven and Earth become divided and out of balance.\r\nIf you want to have the Way appear in front of you,\r\nDo not remain \"agreeable\" or \"opposed\" to anything.\r\n\r\nWhen \"disagreeable\" and \"agreeable\" compete with each other,\r\nThis makes your heart/mind sick.\r\nWhen you do not understand the deep and mysterious meaning of the Way,\r\nIt is useless to merely quiet your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe Way is perfect and complete, just like the greatest void -\r\nNothing lacking, nothing extra.\r\nIt is precisely because you \"select\" and \"reject\"\r\nThat you therefore do not perceive the Suchness of everything.\r\n\r\nDo not pursue Being and entanglements;\r\nDo not dwell in Emptiness and sufferance.\r\nWhen the mind is at peace in Oneness,\r\nThus are these eliminated, and naturally fade away.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to stop activity to return to stillness,\r\nThis stillness further increases activity.\r\nIf you are always caught in one side or the other, [A]\r\nHow can you know Oneness?\r\n\r\nWhen Oneness is not understood completely,\r\nBoth of these viewpoints lose their usefulness :\r\nTo reject Being is to merely lose Being;\r\nTo embrace Emptiness is to merely be burdened by Emptiness.\r\n\r\nToo much talking, too much worrying,\r\nAnd you fall out of harmony[B] with the Way.\r\nBe done with talking, be done with worrying,\r\nAnd nothing will be closed to you. [C]\r\n\r\nReturn to the source and you gain the meaning;\r\nPursue enlightenment[D] and you lose this wisdom.\r\nBut the moment you return to enlightenment[D],\r\nYou go beyond and reject appearances and Emptiness.\r\n\r\nApparent changes in appearances and Emptiness\r\nAre all caused by foolish opinions.\r\nYou need not seek what is true and real,\r\nYou must only stop having opinions.\r\n\r\nDo not dwell in dualistic opinions -\r\nBe careful not to pursue them.\r\nNot until \"right\" and \"wrong\" exist\r\nDoes your heart/mind thus become lost in confusion.\r\n\r\nDuality is caused by the One's existence;\r\nBut also do not dwell on the One.\r\nWhen your heart/mind is one, no thoughts arise;\r\nThen all things are without blame.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no blame, there can be no things;\r\nWhen no thoughts arise, there can be no heart/mind.\r\nWhen things cease to be, mind follows;             [E]\r\nWhen mind settles, things are rejected.            [E]\r\n\r\nThings are caused by mind, but are things as well; [E]\r\nMind is caused by things, but is mind as well.     [E]\r\nIf you want to know both halves,\r\nTheir origin is One Emptiness.\r\n\r\nWithin One Emptiness both halves are the same,\r\nEach equally containing all forms.\r\nWhen you do not perceive \"refined\" and \"coarse\",\r\nHow can preferences exist?\r\n\r\nThe essence of the Great Way is vast -\r\nNothing easy, nothing difficult.\r\nThose with petty opinions are full of doubt and suspicion;\r\nWhen they become anxious, they get behind.\r\n\r\nAttachments lead to loss of inner freedom,\r\nAs you certainly enter the wrong path.\r\nLetting go leads to natural spontaneity,\r\nWhere the essence of the Way is neither absent nor present.\r\n\r\nAllowing your inner nature to unite with the Way,\r\nBe free and done with aggravation.\r\nRestricted thinking is opposed to what is true and real,\r\nSinking into darkness and confusion, which is not good.\r\n\r\nIt is not good to trouble your spirit -\r\nSo why see \"distant\" or \"close\" relationships?\r\nIf you want to attain the Way,\r\nDo not dislike your senses and thoughts.\r\n\r\nNot disliking your senses and thoughts\r\nIs also the same as true Awakening.\r\nThe wise practice non-action,\r\nWhile the foolish restrict themselves.\r\nOne thing is not different from another thing,\r\nBut the foolish have their desires and attachments.\r\n\r\nTo govern heart/mind by using heart/mind -\r\nHow can that not be a great mistake?\r\nDelusion produces peace and chaos,\r\nBut the Awakened have no likes or dislikes.\r\n\r\nAll pairs of opposites\r\nCome from your own foolish thinking.\r\nThey are like dreams, illusions, mirages -\r\nWhy struggle to catch and hold them?\r\n\r\n\"Gain\" and \"loss\", \"right\" and \"wrong\" -\r\nJust for a moment, let go and reject them.\r\n\r\nIf your eyes do not sleep,\r\nAll dreams are naturally eliminated.\r\nIf your heart/mind does not discriminate,\r\nAll things are of One Suchness.\r\n\r\nWithin the deep and mysterious essence of this One Suchness,\r\nYou rise above entanglements, and thus they are forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen all things are perceived as equal,\r\nYou return again to your natural spontaneity.\r\nEliminate them and as a result,\r\nYou cannot have any way to compare them.\r\n\r\nStillness set in motion is not movement,\r\nMovement stopped is not stillness.\r\nIf both halves are actually incomplete,\r\nHow can the One exist like that?\r\n\r\nWhen you examine this exhaustively to its extreme conclusion,\r\nNo path or rule remains.\r\nPlace your heart/mind in harmony with non-discrimination,\r\nWhich stops all mental activity.\r\n\r\nDoubts and suspicions fade completely;\r\nTrue faith is harmonious and straightforward.\r\nNothing is held on to,\r\nNothing can be remembered.\r\n\r\nYou are empty, clear, naturally enlightened[D],\r\nAnd make no effort to use the power of your heart/mind.\r\nHere no amount of thought can dwell;\r\nKnowledge and feelings are unable to comprehend.\r\n\r\nWithin the true and real Suchness of this absolute source of existence,\r\nThere is no \"other\", no \"self\".\r\nIf you want to come quickly into harmony with this realm,\r\nOnly say \"no duality\".\r\n\r\nIn \"no duality\" everything is the same,\r\nNothing is excluded.\r\nWise people everywhere\r\nHave all entered this wisdom.\r\n\r\nEntering this wisdom can not be hurried nor held back -\r\nIt could happen in one moment or take an eternity. [F]\r\nThe Way is neither present nor absent,\r\nYet the Way is everywhere in front of your eyes.\r\n\r\nExtremely small is the same as extremely large,\r\nWhen boundaries are forgotten and done with.\r\nExtremely large is the same as extremely small,\r\nWhen distinct opposites are not perceived.\r\n\r\nBeing is simultaneously the same as non-Being;\r\nNon-Being is simultaneously the same as Being.\r\nIf you are not like this,\r\nYou certainly must not remain there.\r\n\r\nOne is not separate from All;\r\nAll is not separate from One.\r\nIf only you can be like this,\r\nWhy worry about not being perfect?\r\n\r\nThe true heart/mind is non-dual;\r\nNon-dual is the true heart/mind.\r\nTalking about the Way ends here,\r\nFor the Way has no past or future or present.\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\nA : literally, \"only blocked in both sides\"\r\nB : literally, \"turn to non-agreement\"\r\nC : literally, \"nowhere will be blocked\"\r\nD : I believe what is meant by this symbol (\"illumination\") is the Light\r\n    of the Buddha, enlightenment, etc.; however, this is the only\r\n    interpretation that is my personal opinion, and has no support from\r\n    any other sources\r\nE : the literal translations, \"subject\" and \"object\", refer respectively\r\n    to the mind and the things it perceives\r\nF : I believe this line (literally, \"one moment eternity\") refers to the\r\n    \"sudden vs. gradual\" debate on whether enlightenment can happen\r\n    quickly, or can only be achieved after many years (some say many\r\n    lifetimes) of practice\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs \r\n3.0 Unported License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0).
