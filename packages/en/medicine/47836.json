Strong in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA short time ago I published a popular treatise on _The Diseases of\r\nWoman_, in the non pregnant state, and in that work I announced my\r\nintention of shortly publishing a similar one on _Pregnancy and its\r\ndiseases_. This book is the fulfilment of that promise.\r\n\r\nBeing the first _popular_, and yet strictly _scientific_ and\r\n_practical_ book on Midwifery ever published, its preparation has\r\nnecessarily been a work of great labour and difficulty. Everything\r\nhad to be simplified; familiar explanations had to be given of\r\ncomplicated processes, and illustrations had to be designed that could\r\nbe understood by my readers. Little or no assistance could be obtained\r\nfrom other works on the subject, because they were either designed for\r\nprofessional men; and therefore too technical, or else were too general\r\nin their explanations, and too unsystematical, to be of any practical\r\nuse. I therefore had to write every part afresh myself, and plan a new\r\narrangement; and so difficult was this to do, satisfactorily, that I\r\nhave _twice before_ completed the whole work, and then commenced at the\r\nbeginning again, before I was satisfied with my own production.\r\n\r\nAs it now stands, I trust this treatise answers the purposes for\r\nwhich it was intended. I have taken care to make it so complete, and\r\nscientific, that a medical student may take it for his text book; and\r\nat the same time I have endeavoured to so simplify it that any female,\r\nof ordinary capacity, can fully understand both its explanations and\r\npractical directions. All purely technical words have been avoided, or,\r\nwhen absolutely necessary, they have been carefully explained. Every\r\ntopic connected with the main subjects has been discussed, and the\r\nlatest information given on every point, and from every source.\r\n\r\nSuch a work as this has long been needed. Females have been kept in\r\nshameful ignorance, of everything connected with their own systems, and\r\nof the wonderful phenomena in which they play so important a part. That\r\nignorance has led to untold evils, which can never be corrected till\r\nthey become more enlightened respecting themselves. Fortunately many\r\nof them begin to see this, and they request, in behalf of themselves\r\nand their sisters, that such knowledge be no longer withheld. I have\r\nbeen now, for a long time, engaged in this pleasing task of female\r\ninstruction, both by my Lectures and books, and in my daily communion\r\nwith them as patients; I am therefore aware both of their great lack of\r\nproper information, and of their strong desire for it, and I flatter\r\nmyself I also know, from experience and careful observation, the\r\nbest mode of imparting it to them. In fact, I have made it a matter\r\nof careful study, not only to render my subject _plain_, but also\r\n_pleasing_ and _unobjectionable_; so that the most unreflecting shall\r\nfeel an interest in it, and the most sensitive be able to study it\r\nwithout pain or repugnance.\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is not to make _every_ woman a professional\r\nMidwife, nor to induce her to dispense with proper assistance in her\r\nhour of difficulty, but simply to explain to her the nature and manner\r\nof child-birth, and the means by which she is to be assisted. This will\r\ndisabuse her mind of many pernicious errors--make her more patient\r\nunder her unavoidable difficulties and pains--more docile to what is\r\nrequired of her, since she will see the _reason_ for it--and it will\r\nalso enable her to avoid much positive suffering, and to render great\r\nhelp, in many cases, to her attendant.--In a case of emergency also,\r\nwhen other assistance cannot be procured time enough, or not at all,\r\nit will teach one female how to assist another in delivery, which\r\nevery one of them ought to be able to do. Very often it happens that a\r\ncase of this kind occurs, and the Females around, instead of knowing\r\nhow to help the sufferer, are utterly useless, and even make her\r\nworse by their evident terror and ignorance. I have known women _die_\r\nin child-bed, for want of the most trivial assistance, which even a\r\nchild could understand how to give, though there were elderly females,\r\nmothers themselves, around her; but they knew not what to do. Such a\r\nstate of things is disgraceful to the boasted intelligence of the age,\r\nand should be remedied as speedily as possible. Every Adult female, or\r\nat least every married one, should be instructed in these things, so\r\nthat she may know how to regulate her own conduct and how to render\r\nuseful assistance to others in case of need. Ill informed women are\r\ngenerally as apprehensive of danger as they are incapable of avoiding\r\nit; and as regardless of proper advice as they are ignorant of the\r\nreason for it.\r\n\r\nThe time, I trust, is fast coming, when every female will be taught,\r\nas of paramount importance, everything which concerns her own welfare;\r\nand when ignorance will no longer be considered necessary to propriety\r\nand virtue, nor useful knowledge incompatible with the most refined\r\ndelicacy and the strictest morality. I consider it my duty to assist\r\nin hastening that time, and I feel much pleased that my previous\r\nefforts have been so much commended. This book I hope will be equally\r\nacceptable, and, if possible, more useful, than those which have\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\n    F. HOLLICK, M. D.,\r\n\r\n    New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nParturition, or the expulsion of the perfectly formed human being from\r\nthe body of its mother, is a most wonderful natural function, for\r\nthe complete and safe performance of which at the proper time, every\r\nrequisite is found to exist. Notwithstanding the contrary experience\r\nof society, as it now exists, it is well known that extreme suffering,\r\nand danger to life, are not necessary nor even probable accompaniments\r\nto child-birth; for it is invariably found, when females live under\r\ncircumstances favourable to their full physical development and health,\r\nthat it occurs speedily, and with little or no difficulty or pain.\r\nNumerous proofs of this could be given in accounts of the Indians, and\r\nother uncivilized females, among whom parturition is regarded as an\r\nordinary occurrence, for which no preparation need be made, and about\r\nwhich no apprehension need be felt; such facts, however, are so well\r\nknown that they only need be referred to here.\r\n\r\nAs the organization and requirements of society changes, by the\r\nadoption of what is called civilization, the condition of woman becomes\r\nvery different to what it was originally. In many respects her lot\r\nis much meliorated, and she has great reason to be pleased with the\r\nchange, but in other respects she has not been so fortunate.\r\n\r\nOne great evil resulting from her altered position is, a neglect of\r\nproper physical education while young, and of the various requirements\r\nfor bodily health in after life. In consequence of which she becomes\r\nconstitutionally weaker, and more sensitive to various injurious\r\ninfluences, which she possesses diminished powers to withstand.\r\nThis evil increases in proportion as civilization advances, until\r\nat last females become so imperfectly organized, and so enervated,\r\nthat they are utterly unable to fulfil the duties assigned them, and\r\nthey either die prematurely, or pass their whole lives in suffering\r\nand complaint. So universally is this the case at the present time,\r\nparticularly in cities, that the exempt are very rare exceptions\r\nto a rule most lamentably general. Unfortunately, custom and false\r\nnotions have given this melancholy state the stamp of propriety, and\r\nthrown around it the charm of fashion. The suffering invalid is called\r\n_interesting_, and the pale faced debilitated creature, scarcely able\r\nto crawl about, is styled _genteel_, while robust health and physical\r\ncapability is termed _coarseness_ and _vulgarity_. So infatuated,\r\nand weak minded, have females been made on this point, that I have\r\nactually known some of them quite chagrined because people could see\r\nthey were well and strong; and I have known others quite alarmed for\r\nfear that they should _look_ so. A short time ago I knew a lady who,\r\nby the adoption of a proper course of training and treatment, passed\r\nthrough her confinement so quickly, and with so little exhaustion,\r\nthat she was up and travelling about in three days after, not only\r\nwithout inconvenience but with pleasure and advantage. But what was\r\nthe impression made on her female friends by such a speedy recovery?\r\ndid they feel quite pleased at it, and desirous that all others should\r\nbe equally fortunate? No; but quite the contrary! She was actually\r\nthought deserving of _reprehension_, and was stigmatized as _vulgar_ in\r\nthe extreme. One person even made the remark, that she must be _a very\r\ncommon person, and no Lady_! Now what a pitiable state of ignorance,\r\nand mental imbecility, these females must be in, to be actually _proud\r\nof their infirmities_; and yet they are but like the majority of\r\ntheir sex. If they were not so _unfortunate_ in not knowing their true\r\ninterests, they would be highly culpable, but as it is they are truly\r\ndeserving of our pity.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that though civilization has, so far,\r\nentailed these evils on women, it has also done much to alleviate them.\r\nMany diseases are beneficially modified, and some are even _cured_, by\r\nmedical treatment; surgical science has also attained a high point of\r\nperfection; and the difficulties attendant on child birth are overcome\r\nto a great extent by obstetrical skill. But notwithstanding all this\r\nalleviation, these evils are still deplorably great. The utmost\r\nscientific skill to which society can ever attain, will do but little\r\ntowards effectually relieving human suffering, and removing disease,\r\nso long as it is entirely devoted to the mere art of _curing_ and\r\n_palliating_ as it chiefly is now. Our knowledge of the human system,\r\nand of the causes which produce in it disease and deterioration, must\r\nbe universally disseminated, so that the whole people may see _how\r\nthese evils arise_, and how they should live, and conduct themselves,\r\nso as to _avoid them altogether!_ or, in other words, science should\r\nteach us how to _prevent_ disease and suffering, instead of merely how\r\nto alleviate them. Eventually this will be done, and our females will\r\nthen pass through their travail as easily as their savage sisters do\r\nnow. Let us hope that time will soon come; and let every one esteem it\r\nhis duty, who possesses the ability, to hasten its coming, by doing all\r\nhe can to spread the necessary information to those who need it.\r\n\r\nThe happy exemption from difficulty and suffering which females enjoy\r\nin more uncultivated states of society, and which we believe they will\r\nultimately enjoy universally, does not however obviate the necessity\r\nfor assistance _now_, in our state of society, and we have therefore to\r\nexplain how it can best be rendered.\r\n\r\nIt has often been a matter of dispute, both with medical men and with\r\nmoralists, whether _Men_ or _Women_ ought to assist in child-birth.\r\nThe discussion has called forth a great deal of declamation, but very\r\nlittle has been said to the point on either side. It appears to me,\r\nhowever, that the question may be very easily settled, if it be rightly\r\nconsidered. The first requisite, and the most indispensable, in those\r\nwho are to assist in child birth is, that they should _know how to\r\nassist_. This is paramount to every thing else. Now, if females really\r\ndid know what to do in such cases, and were fully competent to do it,\r\nI think there is no question but they would be the _best_ assistants,\r\nto say nothing of their being the most _proper_. There are many\r\nthings experienced by females in such situations, which can never be\r\nunderstood by a man at all, though they are readily appreciated by one\r\nof their own sex, particularly if she has been a mother herself. With\r\neach other also there would be less disposition and less occasion for\r\nreserve in delicate communications, and less repugnance to necessary\r\nexamination or manipulation, which could therefore be more efficiently\r\npractised. In short, if women were undoubtedly equally competent with\r\nmen in this art, and full confidence was felt in them by their own sex,\r\nI think it is evident they would, in every respect, be the most fitting\r\npractitioners, and I have no doubt but they would be preferred. The\r\nquestion simply arises then, whether they are so competent? And every\r\none able to judge, who speaks honestly, must admit that very few, if\r\nany of them really are so. It has not been possible for them to acquire\r\nthe requisite information, nor to pursue the necessary investigations,\r\nand therefore we cannot expect that they can be equal to those who\r\nhave. There are some women I know, who have been careful observers,\r\nand who have had great experience, that can render all needful help _in\r\nmost cases_, but even they are apt to meet with difficulties, which\r\nrequire more skill than they possess to overcome; therefore very few\r\nlike to depend upon them altogether. It is naturally argued that, as a\r\nphysician _may_ be needed, it is better to have him at first, and so be\r\nready for every contingency.\r\n\r\nThat females can make competent _Accoucheurs_ is proved by numerous\r\nwell known instances, among which I need only refer to MADAME\r\nBOIVIN, and MADAME LACHAPELLE, both of whom, as practitioners and as\r\nauthors, stand in the very highest rank. These ladies are referred\r\nto as authorities, and their works are quoted by the most eminent\r\nProfessors of the day; in fact, on many points, they have surpassed all\r\ncompetitors. Further on in our work we shall have occasion to refer to\r\ntheir labours, the value of which will then be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that females can officiate, if they are\r\nproperly instructed, which I think they ought to be, independent of the\r\nreasons already given. That they will eventually be competent I have no\r\ndoubt, and I am proud to throw my mite of instruction in their way to\r\nassist in making them so.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the alledged _immorality_ resulting from the present\r\nsystem of men acting as Midwives, there is much exaggeration, and\r\nmuch unnecessary alarm. That it is, in some respects, indelicate, and\r\nonly to be justified by necessity is true, but there is no foundation\r\nfor saying, as some do, that it leads to wide spread Profligacy\r\nand Adultery. I should prefer to see females always able to assist\r\neach other; but I cannot nevertheless consider the present system a\r\nnecessary cause of licentiousness.\r\n\r\nThat females were always depended upon in old times, and are now in\r\ncertain rude communities, is true, but that is no reason why they\r\nshould be depended upon under all circumstances. In our present\r\nhighly artificial state there are numerous causes at work, and\r\nnumerous difficulties experienced, unknown to more primitive times and\r\nconditions, and we therefore require greater skill and more extensive\r\nresources. Females have in fact become more in want of help, and less\r\nable to assist.\r\n\r\nAt what time, and in what country, men first began to assist in cases\r\nof labour is not recorded. They have done so however for a long time,\r\nmuch longer than most people suppose. In the time of _Hippocrates_,\r\ncalled the Father of Medicine, who lived _more than four hundred years\r\nbefore Christ_, it appears that physicians were commonly resorted to.\r\nIn his writings we find cases described, which show that he was well\r\nacquainted with the process of parturition, and even with some of the\r\nmost difficult operations now practised. The Israelites appear to have\r\nemployed women, as most eastern nations in fact do at the present day.\r\n\r\nMidwifery, however, did not attract much attention, nor make much\r\nprogress, till about the middle of the sixteenth century, since when\r\nit has been studied and practised by the most eminent Physicians and\r\nSurgeons, and has arrived at great perfection.\r\n\r\nMany new discoveries have been made lately, which enable us to\r\nfacilitate delivery and ease its pains, so that it is now robbed of\r\nmany of its former terrors and dangers. Some of these discoveries are\r\nof easy application, and promise much future good; I shall carefully\r\ndescribe them all, in the following pages.\r\n\r\n    F.

A complete acquaintance, so far as our knowledge\r\nextends, would be advisable, but is not absolutely required, and\r\ncould not with convenience be given here. The following explanations\r\ntherefore, chiefly taken from my book on the Diseases of Woman, are\r\nmerely sufficient for the present occasion, and for reference--full\r\ndetails being reserved for a separate and complete work, now preparing,\r\non the _Philosophy and Physiology of the Reproductive Functions_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE ORGANS AND PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate I, represents one half of the Female body, supposing it to be cut\r\ndown the middle, and gives an accurate representation of the relative\r\nposition of the different organs.\r\n\r\nPlate II, represents a front view of the Female body, with the external\r\nwalls removed, to show the relative position of the organs.\r\n\r\nPlate III, represents the uterus and its appendages removed from the\r\nbody, so that their connections with each other may be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nB. The Womb.--C. The Vagina.--_e. e._ The Ovaries.--_f. f._ The\r\nFallopian Tubes.--_s._ The left broad Ligament, the right one being\r\nremoved.--_r. r._ The Round Ligaments.--_g._ The Os Tincæ, or Mouth of\r\nthe Womb.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\n_The Ovaries._--(_e. e._ Plates I, II and III.)--These are two oval\r\nshaped bodies, about the size of an almond nut, placed one on each\r\nside, nearly in the groin. They contain a number of small round grains,\r\nor granules, called the _ovæ_, or eggs, which are the germs of human\r\nbeings, as the eggs of birds are of their particular kind. They are\r\nconnected with the uterus by two short arms, or prolongations, and are\r\nenclosed in the folds of the broad ligaments.\r\n\r\n_The Fallopian Tubes._--(_f. f._ Plates I and II.)--These are two\r\nTubes, one on each side, beneath the Ovaries, and extending farther.\r\nEach of them has a small passage which opens into the uterus at one\r\nend, and opposite the Ovaries at the other. Their use is to convey the\r\nimpregnating principle to the Ovaries, at the time of conception, and\r\nto convey the Ovæ, when impregnated, to the interior of the Womb.\r\n\r\n_The Uterus, or Womb._--(B. Plates I, II.)--This is a hollow organ,\r\nplaced between the Bladder, which is in front, and the Rectum, which is\r\nbehind. It is connected with the Vagina, and opens into it by the small\r\norifice called the mouth of the womb.--(_g._ Plate I.)--The Uterus\r\nis the organ which receives the impregnated ovum, and in which it is\r\ndeveloped into the human being. It is connected with the Ovaries by the\r\nFallopian Tubes, and with the Vagina by the Os Tincæ, and is retained\r\nin its situation partly by its connections with other organs, and\r\npartly by the round and broad ligaments.\r\n\r\n_The Vagina._--(C. Plate I.)--This is the passage which leads to the\r\nWomb from the external opening.\r\n\r\n_The Os Tincæ, or Mouth of the Womb._--(_g._ Plates I and II.)--This is\r\nthe small orifice, opening into the Vagina, by which communication is\r\nestablished with the Uterus from without.\r\n\r\n_The Bladder._--(A. Plates I and II.)--The Receptacle of the Urine. It\r\nis placed immediately in front, on the pubic bone, the Uterus lying\r\nnearly on the top of it.\r\n\r\n_The Rectum, or Termination of the large Intestine._ (D. Plates I and\r\nII.)--This is situated behind the Vagina, and between it and the back\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n_The Broad Ligaments._--(_s._ Plate III.)--These are two broad folds\r\nof membrane, which serve partly to enclose the Fallopian Tubes and\r\nOvaries, and partly to sustain the Womb in its place. They adhere to\r\nthe Uterus and to the walls of the Pelvis.\r\n\r\n_The Round Ligaments._--(_r. r._ Plates II and III.) These two cords\r\narise from each upper corner of the Uterus, and curving downwards are\r\nfixed by their other extremities to the pubic bone. They are partly\r\nenclosed in the Broad Ligaments. They assist in sustaining the Uterus\r\nin its position, and probably also they strengthen the Broad Ligaments\r\nand prevent their rupture when the strain upon them is too great.\r\n\r\n_Fimbriæ of the Fallopian Tubes._--(_t. t._ Plate III.) These Fimbriæ\r\nare like Tentaculæ, or fingers, springing from the extreme ends of the\r\nTubes, and floating loosely in the cavity of the pelvis. Their use is\r\nto clasp hold of the ovaries at the time of conception, so that the\r\nfecundating principle can reach them, and also to take up the ovæ when\r\nimpregnated, and convey them into the Tube, down which they pass into\r\nthe Womb.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\n_The External Lips._--(_l._ Plate I.)--These are commonly termed the\r\n_Labiæ externa_. They are two broad folds of membranous and adipose\r\nsubstance, forming the portals to the Vulva, or entrance to the Vagina.\r\n\r\n_The Internal Lips._--(_m._ Plate I.)--These are two smaller labiæ,\r\nsometimes called the Nymphæ, within the first, the chief use of which\r\nappears to be to direct the flow of the urine from the urethra.\r\n\r\n_The Hymen._--(_n._ Plate I.)--This is a membrane generally found\r\nin virgins, which grows over and closes more or less completely the\r\nentrance to the Vagina. Use unknown. When it exists there is generally\r\na small orifice through it, by which the menses escape at each monthly\r\nperiod.--(_o._ Plate I.)\r\n\r\n_The Clitoris._--(_p._ Plate I.)--This is a small prominent organ,\r\nabout the size of a large pea, placed in the upper part of the opening\r\nbetween the external lips, and immediately above the Meatus Urinarius.\r\nIt is the principal seat of venereal excitement, and is subject to many\r\nannoying diseases.\r\n\r\n_The Perineum._--(_q._ Plate I.)--The part between the Vulva, or\r\nentrance to the Vagina, and the fundament. It is chiefly composed of\r\nthe muscles belonging to the neighboring parts, and assists very much\r\nin supporting the womb.\r\n\r\n_The Meatus Urinarius_, or Mouth of the Bladder, (_h._ Plate I.)--A\r\nsmall opening by which the urine escapes, placed between the lips, and\r\nimmediately above the Vulva, or entrance to the Vagina.\r\n\r\nThese organs are all placed within, or in contact with, the lower part\r\nof the Trunk, called the pelvis. They are all intimately connected\r\nwith each other, and some of them have most extensive and strong\r\nsympathies with almost every other part of the system. So much so is\r\nthis the case in fact, that probably the great majority of diseases to\r\nwhich females are liable arise, directly or indirectly, from Uterine or\r\nOvarian derangement. Very often the heart, the stomach, or some other\r\norgan, though perfectly healthy, is thought to be diseased, and appears\r\nto be so, merely from its sympathy with the diseased womb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE PRINCIPAL ORGANS AND PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nVertical Section of the Womb and Vagina, natural size.\r\n\r\n_a. a. a._ The solid walls of the Womb cut through. _b._ That part of\r\nthe cavity, or hollow of the Womb, which is in the fundus, or top. _c._\r\nThat part of the cavity which is in the lower part, or neck, of the\r\nWomb. _d._ The Vagina. _e. e._ The cut edges of the Vagina. _f. f._\r\nThe positions of the Fallopian Tubes, which are cut off, and down the\r\npassages of which two needles are passed. _g._ The Os Tincæ, or Mouth\r\nof the Womb.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general explanation already given, there are some of\r\nthe Female organs whose peculiar structure requires to be more fully\r\nnoticed, on account of its important influence on some of the processes\r\nhereafter to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the womb, viewed in front, and in connection\r\nwith its appendages, is shown in Plate III. It is placed in the Pelvis,\r\nbetween the bladder and the Rectum, and at the top of the Vagina, as\r\nseen in Plates I and II. Its internal structure is represented in\r\nPlate IV.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Womb, after puberty, is about three inches; its\r\nbreadth at the upper part, or fundus, about two inches; and at the\r\ncervix, or neck, about one inch. The cavity in the interior is small,\r\nowing to the thickness of the walls, and its form is triangular. The\r\nshape of the Womb resembles a pear, somewhat flattened, from before\r\nbackward. Previous to puberty its size is much smaller, and with those\r\nwho have had children it often exceeds the dimensions we have given.\r\n\r\nThe _Neck_, or narrow part, (_c._ Plate IV.) is much changed by\r\npregnancy. In virgins it is long and pointed, and somewhat enlarged\r\nin the middle. In those who have borne children it is considerably\r\nshorter, more obtuse, and less regular in its form. The cavity in the\r\nNeck is larger in the middle than at either end, as will be seen in\r\nPlate IV.\r\n\r\nThe _Os Tincæ_, or mouth of the Womb, also undergoes considerable\r\nchange from the same cause. In the young person it is merely like a\r\nsmall slit, scarcely to be felt, but after pregnancy it much enlarges,\r\nand remains more or less permanently open. The anterior lip, or the one\r\nin front, is somewhat larger than the posterior one.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Uterus is formed of a very dense, gray colored,\r\nmuscular substance, possessing astonishing contractile power. The\r\ninterior is lined, like the Vagina, with a mucus membrane, and the\r\nwhole organ is plentifully supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable properties of the Womb is that of being\r\nable to distend to an extraordinary degree, and then retract again to\r\nnearly its original size. The force which it sometimes exhibits during\r\nits contraction is very great, being sufficient to separate, and even\r\nbreak, the bones of the mother's pelvis, and paralyze the hand of the\r\noperator when introduced. The Muscular Fibres on which this contractile\r\nforce depends are most obvious during gestation; they then appear\r\nvery numerous, and very curiously disposed, some of them ramifying in\r\nalmost every direction, as will be seen by Plates V, VI. It is owing to\r\nthis that the Womb contracts in every conceivable direction, and thus\r\npresses, during labor, on every part of the child's body.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  Figures 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. In this plate represents the Muscular Fibres a little\r\n  exaggerated, so that they can be more distinctly seen.--_a. a._ are\r\n  the orifices of the Fallopian Tubes.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2.

This represents the appearance of the Fibres externally, and\r\n  shows how they terminate in the round ligament a. b.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. The lines _a. b._ represent the direction of the force of the\r\n  Fundul Fibres; _c. d._ That of the Circular Muscles of the body of\r\n  the Uterus; _d. e._ The combined force of the Muscles.\r\n\r\n  The dotted lines represent the force reflected by the liquor amnii.\r\n  The dotted curved lines the direction of the circular fibres of the\r\n  body of the Uterus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VI.\r\n\r\nThe Muscular Fibres of the Womb.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VAGINA.\r\n\r\nThe Vagina (_c._ Plate I.) is a membranous canal, lined with a mucus\r\nmembrane like the Uterus. By its upper part it is attached to the neck\r\nof the Womb, at about two-thirds of its height--so that two-thirds of\r\nthe neck hang within the Vagina. Below, it terminates in the Vulva,\r\nor external mouth. The upper part of the Vagina is much larger than\r\nthe lower part, particularly in those who have borne children. It is\r\ncapable of considerable distension, and after retraction, to allow of\r\nthe child passing down it from the Womb. The external mouth is called\r\nthe _Vulva_, and is usually partly closed, in the virgin state, by the\r\nmembrane called the Hymen, (_n._ Plate I.) The length of the Vagina is\r\nfrom three to five inches, and its diameter from one inch to one and a\r\nhalf, or even two inches in those who have borne many children.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VULVA.\r\n\r\nThis is the external opening, or mouth of the Vagina, through which\r\nthe child has to pass at the termination of delivery. The external and\r\ninternal lips, with the muscular and membranous tissue surrounding it,\r\nare all capable of great distension, without injury, to allow of the\r\npassage of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERINEUM.\r\n\r\nThis is the part situated between the Vulva and the Rectum. (_p._\r\nPlate I.) It is composed of a somewhat dense and firm substance,\r\nchiefly muscular, and, like all the other parts mentioned, is capable\r\nof great distension. It is important, in many of the manipulations\r\nduring labor, to be well acquainted with it; and when the child's head\r\nis passing the perineum requires supporting, to prevent its being\r\nlacerated or broken through, an accident which often happens from want\r\nof due attention, and which leads to the most serious consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nThe Pelvis is that part of the bony structure, or skeleton, of the\r\nfemale, in which the generative organs are placed, and through which\r\nthe process of parturition is effected. An acquaintance with its\r\nnatural structure, and with the changes which may be produced in its\r\nform and size, by disease and other accidents, is indispensable to\r\nthose who wish to practise or understand midwifery.\r\n\r\nIn early life the Pelvis is composed of several bones, many of which,\r\nafter puberty, grow together. In the adult female it is customary\r\nto speak of but _four_ bones, the sacrum, the coccygis, and the two\r\ninnominata, or hip bones, (see Plates VII, VIII.) In the young female\r\nthese are divided into several distinct parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE VII.\r\n\r\n  _Bones of the Pelvis._\r\n\r\n  _The four principal bones, as found in Mature life._--A. A. The\r\n  Ossa Ilii, or Ossa Innominata, commonly called the haunch, or hip\r\n  bones.--B. The Os Sacrum, or lower part of the back bone.--C. The\r\n  extreme termination of the back bone, called the Os Coccygis.\r\n\r\n  _The divisions into parts, as in Early life._--The Ilium, A, on each\r\n  side, is in three parts; the Ilium, properly so called, marked _a.\r\n  a._; the Pubis, marked _b. b._; and the Ischium, marked _c. c._ The\r\n  Sacrum is in five parts, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\n  _d._ Is the last bone of the spine, which joins the Sacrum.--_e. e._\r\n  Are the Sockets in which the upper parts of the thigh bones fit,\r\n  forming the hip joints.--_g. g._ The two rings, formed by the bones\r\n  of the Pubis and Ischium, each called the Foramen Magnum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.\r\n\r\nBones of the Pelvis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--_a._\r\n\r\nThis represents the Male Pelvis, to show the difference in structure.\r\n\r\nThe letters correspond with those in Plate VII.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nSection of the Pelvis, to show the shape and connection of those parts\r\nnot distinctly visible in the full view. The section is made down the\r\nmiddle of the back bone, and through the symphysis pubes, in front. The\r\nletters correspond with those in Plate VII.\r\n\r\nA. The right Ilium.--B. The Sacrum.--C. The Coccygis.--_b._ The Os\r\nPubis.--_c._ The Os Ischinum.--_g._ The Foramen Magnum.--_o._ shows the\r\nmanner in which the coccygis is bent back through labor.]\r\n\r\nThese bones are all firmly bound together by a cartilaginous substance,\r\nwhich is placed between where they touch, and is firmly attached to\r\neach one. This union is called a _symphysis_. The one at front which\r\njoins the pubic bones is called the symphysis pubis; the two which join\r\nthe Ossa Illii to the Sacrum are called the sacro iliac symphyses;\r\nand that which joins the Coccygis to the Sacrum, is called the Sacro\r\ncoccygeal symphysis. The two pubic bones are separated a little in\r\nPlate VIII, simply to show them better. The reader will bear in mind\r\nthat they are naturally connected by the cartilaginous substance which\r\nforms the symphysis.\r\n\r\nThese articulations, or joinings, become much softened during labor,\r\nand give way a little, but not to any extent sufficient to assist\r\ndelivery. It is a mistake to suppose that the bones separate at that\r\ntime. The only part which gives way is the sacro coccygeal symphysis,\r\nwhich does relax, and allows the Os Coccygis to be pushed back by\r\nthe child's head a full inch or more, thus enlarging the inferior\r\nstrait.--(See _c._ and _o._ Plate VIII.) Sometimes this little bone\r\nwill be even broken off, when there is great disproportion between the\r\nhead and the strait. I have heard it snap like a stick breaking. There\r\nis nothing serious nor alarming in this, however, unless it be _a first\r\ndelivery late in life_, though it may cause some pain at the time, and\r\na little difficulty in _sitting_ for some time after. In young persons\r\nthe symphysis is soft, and gives way easily, so that they have little\r\ndifficulty during delivery from this cause; but if a female marry late\r\nin life, after it becomes hardened, she may suffer considerably. In\r\nthis case the coccygis is usually curved inwards considerably, and\r\nbeing firmly fixed the head cannot push it back, and on that account\r\ncannot pass, without great difficulty, and with the risk of rupturing\r\nsome of the soft parts, or breaking the coccygis completely off. There\r\nis in fact great difficulty, and some danger, if the first pregnancy\r\ntakes place late in life.\r\n\r\nThe Pelvis is usually divided into two parts,--the _great pelvis_, or\r\nupper part, enclosed between the wide flanges of the Ossa illii and\r\nthe upper part of the sacrum; and the _small pelvis_, or basin, which\r\nis enclosed between the lower part of the sacrum and coccygis behind,\r\nand the ossa ischii and ossa pubes in front. The basin is nearly\r\ncylindrical, larger in the middle, and curved towards the front.\r\n\r\n_The Straits of the Pelvis._--The bones of the Pelvis, it will be seen,\r\nform a kind of broad ring, or cylinder, particularly in the basin; and\r\nthe straits are two passages, one by which the child passes into the\r\nbasin from the upper Pelvis, and the other by which it passes out from\r\nthe basin into the world.\r\n\r\nIn Plate VIII. the line marked † is the antero posterior diameter of\r\nthe _upper strait_, through which the child first passes, called also\r\nthe brim, or entrance to the Pelvis. The line marked ‡ is the diameter\r\nof the _lower_ strait, through which the child passes into the world,\r\ncalled also the outlet of the Pelvis. In Plate VII. the line marked †\r\ncrosses the upper strait, or brim of the Pelvis.\r\n\r\n_The diameters of the Pelvis_ are the distances between the prominent\r\npoints of each strait, and are four in number for each, _those for the\r\nupper_ strait being represented below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n  _Diameters of the Upper Strait._\r\n\r\n  A B, which extends from the most prominent point of the Sacrum, to\r\n  the top of the Symphysis pubes, is called the _antero posterior_\r\n  diameter, or that from before to behind.--C D, and E F, are called\r\n  the two _oblique diameters_; they extend from each sacro iliac\r\n  symphysis, to the most prominent point of the Os Ilium on the\r\n  opposite side.--G H, is called the Transverse, or _bis iliac_\r\n  diameter, it crosses the Pelvis nearly from one hip joint to the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  The Sacro Antero posterior diameter measures _four inches_. The\r\n  two oblique diameters _four inches and a half_ each. The bis iliac\r\n  diameter measures _five inches_.\r\n\r\n  (By comparing this with Plate VII. the various points will be still\r\n  more apparent.)\r\n\r\n  The inferior strait has also four diameters, represented in Plate X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IX.\r\n\r\nDiameters of the Upper Strait.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE X.\r\n\r\n  The Bones of the Pelvis viewed from below, looking through the\r\n  inferior strait, to show its diameters.\r\n\r\n  A B, which extends from the end of the Coccygis to the lower part\r\n  of the Symphysis Pubis, is called the _antero posterior_ diameter;\r\n  it measures _four inches_, like that of the upper strait, but is\r\n  increased a little by the bending back of the Coccygis.--C D, and E\r\n  F, are the two _oblique diameters_, also corresponding to those in\r\n  the upper strait; they measure _four inches_, but are increased a\r\n  little by the giving way of the soft parts.--G H, is the transverse,\r\n  or bis-ischiatic diameter; it measures _four inches_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate X.\r\n\r\nThe Bones of the Pelvis viewed from below, looking through the inferior\r\nstrait, to show its diameters.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the diameters only average from four to five\r\ninches, but it must be remembered that the soft parts, and even one of\r\nthe bones, very readily give way, and thus they are slightly increased.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to describe the form and size of the fœtal child's head,\r\nit will be found that its diameters correspond very nearly with those\r\nof the pelvic straits through which it has to pass, so that ordinarily\r\nlabor presents no serious difficulty. If the head be larger than\r\nnatural, from any cause, or if the Pelvis be too small, or deformed,\r\nthis mutual adaptation does not exist, and delivery of course becomes\r\ndifficult, or dangerous, and sometimes impossible. The only obstacle\r\ntherefore, which can seriously impede the expulsion of the fœtus,\r\nor prevent it altogether, is this want of conformity, in size and\r\nshape, between its head and the bones of the Pelvis. The _soft parts_\r\nmay retard labor considerably, by being contracted or rigid, but can\r\ngenerally be made to give way, either by the efforts of nature or\r\nby manual assistance; and the fœtal head can be reduced in size if\r\nnecessary; but insufficient size, or faulty form, in the _bones_, is\r\nirremediable.\r\n\r\nThe various causes which produce deformity, or imperfect development,\r\nin the Pelvis, and unnatural growth of the child's head, will be stated\r\nin a subsequent section. For the present, we have only to do with both\r\nin the normal state.\r\n\r\nThe importance of an accurate knowledge of the structure of the\r\nPelvis, and of the changes which may be induced in it, will now be\r\nobvious; neither the theory nor the practice of Midwifery can in fact\r\nbe understood without such knowledge. It is also frequently of the\r\nfirst importance to know, _previous to marriage_, whether the pelvis\r\nof a young person is so formed that delivery can be safely effected!\r\nInattention to this has sacrificed the lives of many, and caused others\r\nto live for years suffering and helpless. In another place we shall\r\ngive some plain rules and directions by which this important point may\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\n_The floor of the Pelvis._--The soft parts at the bottom of the basin\r\nof the Pelvis, consisting of the perineum and various muscles, are\r\ncalled the floor of the Pelvis--the only passage through which is by\r\nthe Vulva, or mouth of the Vagina. As the head of the child descends\r\nto the bottom of the basin, it presses upon this floor, and gradually\r\ndistends it, until the Vulva is sufficiently enlarged. This delay is\r\nadvantageous, for if the passage was always large enough, or increased\r\nin size without any difficulty, the child would pass too suddenly, and\r\nmuch mischief might often result from its sudden expulsion--such as\r\npulling down of the womb, flooding, and the falling of the child upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n_Direction of the passage of the Pelvis._--In most of the lower animals\r\nthe passage of the Pelvis is straight, and on a line with the body,\r\nthe two straits being opposite each other, which makes delivery much\r\nmore easy with them. Even in the negroes, and other inferior races, the\r\npassage is much straighter than in the whites. The more perfect the\r\norganization therefore, the more difficult is parturition; and the more\r\nimperfect or simple the organization, the more easy is parturition.\r\nThe dotted line in Plate XI. shows the direction of the passage of the\r\nPelvis, in the human female, to be a curve, so that the child has to\r\nmove, during its passage, in a circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nThe axis, or direction, of the upper strait is denoted by the line A,\r\nthat of the lower strait by the line B, and that of the Vulva by the\r\nline C. The force of expulsion tending to push the child in _each_\r\ndirection, it has to traverse a path intermediate with them all, or\r\ncompounded of them all, not being able to move in either alone. This\r\naggregate direction is denoted by the dotted curved line, which shows\r\nthe direction in which the child passes, and in which the hand must be\r\npassed when introduced.\r\n\r\nI is the Perineum.--The dotted line which crosses A denotes the upper\r\nstrait, and the line I the lower strait.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL FEMALE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great object for which the whole of the Female organs perform their\r\nseveral functions is, _that of bringing into existence a new being_!\r\nFor this purpose they act both separately and conjointly, each one\r\nhaving its specific part to play in the grand phenomenon. As already\r\nremarked, it would not be in place here to give all the details of this\r\nwonderful event, but merely such a description of its principal stages,\r\nas will suffice for an understanding of the main subject of the present\r\ntreatise. I shall therefore, first give the uses of the principal\r\norgans separately, and then explain the processes of conception, and\r\nfœtal development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThe Womb is nothing more than the receptacle in which the impregnated\r\negg is placed, and in which it undergoes all the wonderful changes by\r\nwhich it eventually is developed into a perfect human being. The womb\r\nis not therefore absolutely needed in _conception_, and indeed several\r\ncases have been known where the new being was formed without the\r\nwomb altogether, though not perfectly. Its principal use is in fœtal\r\ndevelopment, which cannot take place perfectly in any other part of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OVARIES.\r\n\r\nThe Ovaries, as already remarked, are two oval-shaped bodies, placed\r\none on each side of the womb, and connected with it, whose use is to\r\nform the germ or rudiment, called the ovum, or egg, from which the new\r\nbeing is developed. The structure of the Ovaries is very simple, and\r\nthe manner in which they produce the ovum is not very well understood.\r\nIt is certain however, that they are indispensable to conception, being\r\nin fact the most essential parts of the female generative system.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nMenstruation appears to be a process resulting from the development\r\nand healthy action of the Female organs, and is essential to their\r\nwell being. The following brief account of its nature and origin is\r\nextracted from my _Diseases of Woman_, page 152 to 155:\r\n\r\n \"Until very recently but little was known, with any certainty,\r\n respecting this remarkable and important phenomenon of the female\r\n system. The most crude and visionary theories have been advanced to\r\n explain it, and our works on medicine and physiology do nothing more\r\n than repeat them, one after the other. The investigations of several\r\n distinguished physiologists however, within the last few years, have\r\n thrown a new light on this hitherto obscure subject, and explained\r\n much that was previously unknown, or, at best, merely conjectured\r\n upon. A brief statement of the result of those investigations will not\r\n only be highly interesting in itself, but will materially assist in\r\n explaining what we shall afterwards speak upon.\r\n\r\n \"It is well known that the female organs are liable, at regular\r\n periods, to assume a peculiar action, which results in the discharge\r\n of a fluid termed the menses. The secretion and excretion of which\r\n are highly essential, both to the proper performance of many other\r\n functions, and to the maintenance of the general health. Whence\r\n comes this fluid, and what causes it to flow? These were questions\r\n unanswered, except by mere supposition, previous to the discoveries\r\n referred to, which we now proceed to make known.\r\n\r\n \"In the first chapter it was stated that the _Ovæ_, or eggs, contained\r\n the rudiments or germs, from which, when impregnated by the male\r\n principle, new human beings were developed. These ovæ, however, are\r\n not prepared to undergo this development before the age of puberty,\r\n nor after the change of life, nor are the whole of them fit for\r\n conception even during the prolific period. It appears that they\r\n become fit for fecundation in succession, during the menstrual period,\r\n _one ovum,_ or more, _being ripened every month_! When fully perfected\r\n it separates from the ovary and is lost, unless conception occurs, in\r\n which case it passes along the fallopian tube into the Womb, and then\r\n develops into the fœtus. Here then we see the cause of the menses; the\r\n ripening of the ovum causes a local excitement, and congestion, in the\r\n ovary and womb, which increases till the period when it is thrown off,\r\n and then the accumulated fluid is discharged, the excitement subsides,\r\n and a new development commences.\r\n\r\n \"This curious process is termed by some physiologists the monthly\r\n _ponte_, or _laying of eggs_, and by others the _Ovarian labor_, or\r\n _birth_! A small scar is left on the ovary at the point where the ovum\r\n separates, which fades away after a time, but a number of them may\r\n always be observed on the ovaries of those who have long menstruated.\r\n In those who die during menstruation the ovaries are found very red,\r\n and full of blood, and sometimes one of the ovæ will be found swelled,\r\n and just ready to burst through, or the ruptured opening may be seen\r\n through which it has actually escaped.\r\n\r\n \"Precisely the same phenomenon occurs in the lower animals, excepting\r\n that their periods are more extended; some of them occurring annually,\r\n and others at still longer intervals. Some of the monkeys even have a\r\n species of real menstruation.\r\n\r\n \"These important facts, by enabling us to understand what causes\r\n menstruation, give us an insight also into the nature of its\r\n derangements, and the conditions required for their regulation. When\r\n we call to mind also the close sympathy between the uterine organs and\r\n every other part of the system, it shows us how important a proper\r\n menstruation is to the general health, because without it those organs\r\n must be diseased, and consequently every other part of the system\r\n liable to suffer with them.\r\n\r\n \"Formerly many absurd notions prevailed respecting menstruation, which\r\n in fact are not quite removed even now. Thus some authors asserted\r\n that a female, while unwell, could cause various diseases, by merely\r\n _touching_ persons! Others supposed they would curdle milk, and nearly\r\n all believed that the menstrual fluid itself was highly poisonous,\r\n so that females, at those times, were compelled to live apart and\r\n approach no one. In the Old Testament there are many regulations\r\n given, for females while menstruating, which show the prevalence of\r\n such notions in olden times. It is scarcely necessary to say that\r\n there is no foundation whatever for all this, as the fluid itself\r\n differs but little from ordinary blood, and is equally innocuous.\r\n\r\n \"In like manner it was supposed, that menstruation was influenced by\r\n the _Moon_, and only occurred at a certain period of her age. We know,\r\n however, that females are unwell almost every hour of every day in the\r\n year.\r\n\r\n \"The due establishment of the menstrual function is absolutely\r\n necessary, to the perfection both of mind and body, and its regular\r\n performance is quite as essential to the continuance of health, for\r\n there is scarcely a single disease that its derangement will not\r\n either cause, or at least seriously aggravate.\r\n\r\n \"It is therefore _vitally important_ to attend to this matter,\r\n _particularly in young persons approaching puberty_! A little care\r\n at that time, properly bestowed, may prevent years of disease and\r\n suffering, if not untimely _death_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCEPTION.\r\n\r\nConception is the union of the male principle with the female ovum, or\r\negg, after that is perfected in the manner described in the article on\r\nMenstruation. The precise manner in which this union is effected is\r\nunknown, though our information in regard to it is much more extensive,\r\nand precise, than formerly. As nearly as can be stated it occurs in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\nAt the time of a fruitful connection, which can only occur, it must\r\nbe remembered, when the ovum is ripe, the male principle is carried\r\ninto the Womb, (B, Plates I. and III.) and is then supposed, by some,\r\nto meet with the ovum which has descended down the Fallopian Tube\r\n(_f_, Plates I. and III.) from the Ovary, so that the union of the two\r\ntakes place, according to this view, either in the Fallopian Tube or\r\nin the Womb. Others, however, suppose that the ovum does not leave the\r\nOvary before conception, but that the male principle passes down the\r\nFallopian Tube and meets it there, and that it is several days after\r\nbefore it reaches the Womb. There are many facts and arguments brought\r\nforward in support of each view, all of which will be set forth in my\r\nforthcoming work on the reproductive functions. All that is known for\r\ncertain is, that the two principles must unite in one place or the\r\nother, and that the ovum must pass down the Tube into the Womb, either\r\nbefore impregnation, or after.\r\n\r\nThe union of the two principles in the Womb appears so likely an event\r\nthat it is scarcely possible to avoid thinking that it really does then\r\ntake place, but at the same time there are very strong reasons for\r\nadopting the opinion that it takes place in the Ovary. Among others may\r\nbe mentioned the phenomenon of _extra uterine conception_, which will\r\nbe more fully alluded to in another place. In these cases the fœtus is\r\nfound _outside_ of the Womb, in the Tube, or the Ovary, or even in the\r\nAbdomen, among the intestines. Such an occurrence seems to render it\r\nalmost certain that the ovum must have been fecundated in the Ovary,\r\nbecause we cannot well conceive, if it were not so, how it could reach\r\nthe outside of the Womb. This difficulty is not, however, regarded\r\nas insuperable, by the advocates of the opposite theory. Possibly\r\nconception may occur _in both ways_.\r\n\r\nThere are many causes which prevent conception, or, in other words,\r\nwhich produce _barrenness_ and _sterility_. These various causes\r\ncannot be all explained, except in connection with a full explanation\r\nof the process of reproduction, and of the nature of many female\r\ndiseases. In my work on \"_The Diseases of Woman_,\" I have given a\r\nchapter on this subject, and have also referred to the present work as\r\none in which it would be more fully treated. This reference, however,\r\nwas made in mistake; the subject is not needed here, but will be in\r\nthe other work, on the _reproductive functions_ in which it will be\r\ndiscussed at length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFŒTAL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last Chapter brought us up to the point of conception, or the first\r\ncommencement of the new being. The next step is to exhibit its various\r\nstages of development, and to show how it is nourished and maintained\r\nin its proper position. This is requisite in order to understand the\r\norigin of many diseases and accidents which occur during gestation, and\r\nalso to explain the various signs by which it is determined whether a\r\nfemale is pregnant or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nFŒTAL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nThe development of a perfectly formed human being from the egg in which\r\nit originates, is one of the most astonishing phenomena that can come\r\nunder our observation, and is eminently deserving the study of every\r\nrational being. The present explanation of it must necessarily be\r\nbrief, being merely intended to make the main subject more clear.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that it is uncertain whether the ovum is\r\nimpregnated before it is brought into the Uterus, or after it arrives\r\nthere; but be that as it may, nothing has yet been discovered in the\r\nWomb till several days after conception. Some physiologists tell us\r\nthat the rudiment of the new being may be found there about the _sixth_\r\nday; but others again assure us that it cannot be found before the\r\n_twelfth_, at which period our explanation of its development will\r\ncommence.\r\n\r\n_At the twelfth day_ the ovum is about the size of a large pea, it is\r\ncomposed of a vesicle containing a thick fluid, called the _germ_,\r\nwhich corresponds to the opaque substance seen in the white of a\r\nfecundated bird's egg, and of a yellowish substance, in which it\r\nfloats, called the _vitellus_, which answers to the yelk. The whole\r\nbeing surrounded by two membranous coverings, the outer one called\r\nthe _chorion_, and the inner one the _amnion_. Between these is a\r\ngelatinous substance, and within the amnion is a fluid, called the\r\nliquor amnii. The two membranes, the liquor amnii, and the inclosed\r\novum, are called the _ovulum_! Immediately after conception the uterus\r\nbegins to secrete, from its inner walls, another membrane, very\r\ndelicate, called the _decidua_. This lines the whole cavity, so that\r\nwhen the ovulum passes out of the tube it is met by this lining which\r\nseems to prevent its entrance into the womb. The ovulum, however,\r\npresses upon it and so makes a depression, like a nest, in which it\r\nlies. This prevents its moving about, or falling to the bottom of the\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the entire ovulum is about one grain. The embryo\r\ncommences in the germ, and may now be seen about the size of a pin's\r\npoint. The vitellus removes away from it, but remains connected by a\r\nsmall pedicel or thread-like tube, down which it is gradually absorbed\r\nas nutriment. A small white thread, scarcely perceptible, may be seen\r\nsometimes as early as this period, being the commencement of the brain\r\nand spinal marrow. The mouth is visible also from the twelfth to the\r\ntwentieth day, and frequently the eyes. These are placed at first on\r\nthe side of the head, like those of quadrupeds, and move round to the\r\nfront afterwards.\r\n\r\n_At twenty-five days_, the embryo is about the size of a large ant,\r\nwhich it also resembles in form. It begins to have a little more\r\nconsistence, and the future bones begin to resemble cartilage, or\r\ngristle. A small groove may be seen denoting the neck, which thus\r\nindicates the separation of the head from the trunk. The weight is\r\nthree or four grains.\r\n\r\n_The first month_, it is about the size of a Bee, and is somewhat like\r\na small worm bent together. The arms may be seen like two little warts.\r\nThey are first formed under the skin, and shoot out like buds, growing\r\nstraight from the body; afterwards they become folded together, in\r\na curious manner, upon the breast. The head is as large as the rest\r\nof the body, and upon it we can now see distinctly the eyes, like\r\ntwo black dots, the mouth, like a line, and also the nose. The lower\r\nextremity is lengthened out like a tail. Weight about ten grains.\r\n\r\n_The second month._ Every part has now become much more developed, and\r\nthe general form is that of a human being. The superior members are\r\nmuch more elongated, and the inferior ones begin to be distinguished,\r\nforming in the same manner as the others. The fingers are united\r\ntogether by a membrane, like the web on a Frog's foot. In the ribs,\r\nclavicles, and jaw bones, a few points can be seen ossified, the\r\ncartilage beginning; to harden into bone. The rudiments of the first\r\nteeth are also visible. The weight is about one drachm, and the length\r\none inch.\r\n\r\n_At about seventy days_ the eyelids are visible, the nose becomes\r\nprominent, the mouth enlarges, and the external ear may be seen. The\r\nneck is well defined. The brain is soft and pulpy, and the heart is\r\nperfectly developed.\r\n\r\nEvery organ is originally formed without either blood or blood vessels.\r\nThe circulation which afterwards takes place in them is merely for\r\ntheir subsequent development. The heart is perfect in all its parts,\r\nand even has a slight motion, before the blood is found in it.\r\n\r\n_Three months._ All the essential parts are well defined. The eyelids\r\ndistinct, but firmly closed. The lips perfect, but drawn tightly\r\ntogether. The heart beats forcibly, and in the larger vessels red blood\r\nis seen. The fingers and toes are defined, and the muscles begin to be\r\napparent. The organs of generation are remarkably prominent, but still\r\nit is somewhat difficult, at first, to distinguish the sex by these\r\norgans, notwithstanding their development, as the principal parts in\r\nboth are nearly identical in form. It can, however, be ascertained by\r\nother circumstances, as the form of the head, dorsal spine, thorax, and\r\nabdomen. It now weighs about two ounces and a half, and measures four\r\nor five inches in length.\r\n\r\n_Four months._ The development is remarkably increased. The brain\r\nand spinal marrow becomes firmer, the muscles distinct, and a little\r\ncellular tissue is formed. The abdomen is fully covered in and the\r\nintestines are no longer visible. A little of the substance called\r\n_meconium_ even collects in the intestines, the same as is found in at\r\nbirth. It now weighs seven or eight ounces, and measures six or seven\r\ninches. The bones are ossified in a great part of their extent, and the\r\nrudiments of the second set of teeth are visible, under the first.\r\n\r\nThe uterus now is so large that it can no longer remain in the lower\r\npart of the pelvis, but is compelled to rise up into the abdomen for\r\nmore room. This change of position is improperly called _quickening_!\r\nSometimes it takes place very gradually, so that it is scarcely\r\nnoticed, but more frequently it rises suddenly, disturbing all the\r\ninternal organs, and causing in them considerable derangement till\r\nthey accommodate themselves to the change. This occurrence often\r\ncauses unnecessary alarm, though the sickness, and other unpleasant\r\nsensations, are always sufficiently annoying.\r\n\r\nThis stage corresponds with that in which the young of oviparous\r\nanimals breaks the shell and escapes. The human being however,\r\nundergoes a remarkable change, and remains in the womb for a period\r\nlonger than that already past, in order to become more perfected.\r\n\r\nFrom four to nine months the development is proportionally much more\r\nrapid than during the first four months, owing to the circulation of\r\nperfect red blood, which is now found the same as in the adult, and is\r\nprobably derived from the mother's blood vessels.\r\n\r\n_Five months._ Every part is considerably increased in size, and become\r\nmore perfect. The lungs enlarge, and are even capable of being, to a\r\ncertain extent, dilated. The skin becomes much stronger. The situation\r\nof the nails can be discerned. The meconium is more abundant, and lower\r\ndown in the intestines. The length is now eight or ten inches, and the\r\nweight fifteen or sixteen ounces.\r\n\r\n_Six months._ The nails are marked. The head becomes downy, from the\r\nfirst development of the hair. A little fat is formed. Length twelve\r\ninches, weight from one and a half to two pounds. No indications of\r\nintellectual faculties.\r\n\r\n_Seven months._ The whole being has rapidly progressed. The nails\r\nare formed, the hair is perfect, in the male the testicles descend\r\nto the scrotum, and in the female the ovaries reach the brim of the\r\npelvis. The bones are tolerably firm, and the meconium collects in the\r\nlarge intestines. Length fourteen inches, weight about three pounds.\r\nIntellectual functions not yet exercised.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining months are merely devoted to further increase in size\r\nand weight. No new phenomena present themselves.\r\n\r\n_Nine months._ Every function has become active. The skin becomes\r\ncolored, and perspiration occurs. There are no indications of the\r\nintellectual functions, but the animal functions are remarkably active,\r\nparticularly that of _taste_, which no doubt leads to the act of\r\nsucking, from the natural desire for its gratification. The child can\r\nnow experience all the ordinary sensations of pain, hunger, heat, and\r\ncold, and is capable of preserving an independent existence if brought\r\ninto the world.\r\n\r\nPlate XII. represents a section of the Uterus at about one month of\r\ngestation, so as to show all the parts in their proper situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XII.\r\n\r\n  Section of the Uterus, with the Ovum and appendages, at about one\r\n  month of gestation.--_a. a. a._ The substance of the walls of the\r\n  Womb.--_b. b._ The Embryo.--_c._ The different vessels by which it\r\n  is connected with the Placenta.--_d. d._ The Placenta.--_e._ The\r\n  Vitellus.--_f. f. f._ The Membrane lining the Uterus, called the\r\n  Decidua; it is seen to be bent double, or reflected, the Embryo being\r\n  on the outside of it.--_g. g._ The Chorion, or Middle Membrane, which\r\n  is studded over with villosities, or small blood vessels.--_h. h._\r\n  The Amnion, or inner membrane, which contains the fluid called the\r\n  liquor amnii, in which the Embryo floats.--_i. i._ The blood vessels\r\n  which connect the Placenta with the Womb.--_j._ Is a plug of Mucus,\r\n  by which the mouth of the Womb is now blocked up.--_k. k._ The ends\r\n  of the Fallopian Tubes, which are cut off; these are also blocked up\r\n  with mucus, the same as the Os Tincæ.--_l._ The Os Tincæ, or mouth of\r\n  the Womb.--_m._ The Vagina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XII.\r\n\r\nSection of the Uterus, with the Ovum and appendages, at about one month\r\nof gestation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFŒTAL NUTRITION.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the new being derives its nutriment, or the\r\nmaterial by which it grows, is, in a great measure, unknown to us,\r\nthough we certainly obtain some little information about it by a study\r\nof the apparatus employed in the process.\r\n\r\nFor the first fifteen or twenty days the substance called the\r\n_Vitellus_, (_e._ Plate XII.) which is analagous to the yelk of the\r\nordinary egg, appears to supply most, if not all of the material\r\nthat is required in the formation of the new being; and indeed this\r\nsubstance does not totally disappear till after the third month, though\r\nwe cannot suppose it to be the sole source of nutriment then. It is\r\nalso supposed, by some, that the amniotic liquor, in which the fœtus\r\nfloats, may afford some nutriment, either by being swallowed, or by\r\nbeing absorbed through the skin. It is certain that this fluid is\r\nnutritive, and there is nothing impossible in its absorption, though it\r\nis not very likely to occur to a sufficient extent. The idea that it\r\ncan be swallowed however, is erroneous, because the mouth of the Fœtus\r\nis firmly closed while in the Womb; and besides, children have been\r\nborn alive without _mouths_, and even without _heads_, and of course\r\nthey could not have swallowed anything. It is now generally conceded\r\nby physiologists that the material required by the Fœtus, for its\r\nnutrition, is obtained from the blood of the mother, through the medium\r\nof the Placenta, and the vessels in the Umbilical cord. It is, however,\r\na matter of dispute whether the maternal blood is sent directly, in\r\nits ordinary state, into the body of the child, or whether it first\r\nundergoes a preparatory process, which most modern authors suppose it\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of gestation, the middle membrane, called the\r\nchorion, (_g. g._ P. XII.) is covered, on its outer surface, with a\r\nnumber of small protuberances called _villosities_, which subsequently\r\nbecome true blood vessels. About the fourth month these have increased\r\nvery much in size and number, and have all become conglomerated into\r\none mass, in form like a mushroom. This is called the _Placenta_.\r\nIt is almost entirely formed of blood vessels, which seem to attach\r\nthemselves at one end, by open mouths, to the open mouths of other\r\nblood vessels on the inner walls of the uterus (_i. i._ Plate XII.)\r\nAt the other end these vessels are drawn together and lengthened out\r\ninto a long tube, called the _umbilical cord_, or _navel string_, which\r\nfinally enters the body of the child at the navel and so establishes\r\nthe connexion between it and the mother.--(_c._ Plate XII.)\r\n\r\nThe blood vessels in the placenta, umbilicus, and fœtus, like those\r\nin the maternal body, are of two kinds, _Arteries_ and _veins_. The\r\narteries, which come from the _left_ side of the heart, carry the pure\r\nblood, which contains all the materials for forming and nourishing\r\nevery part of the system. The veins contain the blood in its impure\r\nstate, and take it to the _right_ side of the heart, from whence it is\r\nforced into the lungs to be purified by the act of breathing. The blood\r\nis made impure by some of its constituents being absorbed, to form the\r\ndifferent parts of the body, and by having thrown into it a quantity of\r\nwaste and poisonous matter no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThe course of the blood, therefore, is from the left side of the\r\nmother's heart along her arteries till it reaches the arteries of the\r\nuterus, from them it passes into those of the placenta, and thence into\r\nthose of the umbilicus which convey it into the body of the child.\r\nWhen there it circulates in its arteries, supplies the material for\r\nits further increase and development, becomes in consequence impure,\r\nand passes into its veins, the same as in the maternal body. From\r\nthese veins it passes into those of the umbilicus and placenta, and,\r\napparently, into those of the mother, by which it is conveyed to the\r\nright side of her heart, and by its action to her lungs, to be again\r\npurified when she breathes. This explains what was previously stated,\r\nthat the child uses the mother's heart, lungs, and stomach, while in\r\nthe womb, and has, therefore, no occasion to use its own.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the placenta is about six inches, and its thickness\r\nabout one inch and a half. The length of the umbilical cord is from\r\neighteen to twenty-four inches, its diameter about half an inch. These\r\ndimensions are, however, subject to great variation. Instances are\r\nmentioned of the cord being five feet long, and as thick as the child's\r\narm. I have seen one myself four feet long. Sometimes it will be very\r\nshort, not more than eight or ten inches. It is composed of one artery\r\nand two veins, twisted together like the strands of a cable, and of a\r\nsheath surrounding them composed of the chorion and amnion. Between the\r\nsheath and the vessels is a thick gelatinous fluid called the Gelatine\r\nof Wharton.\r\n\r\nThis explanation, it must be remembered, is in fact merely\r\nhypothetical. The direct passage of the blood through the Placenta,\r\nfrom the mother's vessels into those of the cord, is denied by many\r\nphysiologists, who contend that there is an intermediate set of vessels\r\nin the Placenta, in which it first undergoes important changes.\r\nThey also contend that the impure blood does not pass through into\r\nthe mother's veins at all, but is purified in the Placenta, and\r\nimmediately returned. Some have even averred that the Placenta is not\r\nrequired at all, to supply nourishment, but is merely a purifying\r\norgan. It is now known, however, that it is not absolutely essential\r\nto either process, for children have been born alive, and perfectly\r\nformed, which merely floated loosely in the amniotic liquor, having\r\nneither Placenta nor cord, nor any other connection with the mother.\r\nHow they were nourished we cannot tell. These, however, must be\r\nregarded merely as curious exceptions, there being little doubt but\r\nthat fœtal nutrition is ordinarily effected through the Placenta and\r\ncord, by means of the mother's blood, somewhat in the manner we have\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECULIARITIES OF THE FŒTAL CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance of the fœtus not using its heart and lungs, like\r\nthe adult, its circulation has several modifications.\r\n\r\nThe engine by which the blood is forced along its vessels is the\r\n_heart_! This is divided into two distinct parts, each of which has\r\ntwo cavities, the upper one called the _auricle_, and the lower one\r\nthe _ventricle_, which communicate with each other by curious valves.\r\nIn the adult the whole of the impure blood is poured into the right\r\nauricle, that from the lower part of the body by the _inferior vena\r\ncava_, and that from the upper part by the _superior vena cava_. From\r\nthe right auricle it passes into the right ventricle, which pumps it\r\ninto the lungs, by way of the pulmonary artery; here it is purified by\r\nthe act of respiration, and then brought, when pure, by the pulmonary\r\nveins, into the left auricle, and passes from thence into the left\r\nventricle, which pumps it into the great aorta, and from thence into\r\nthe smaller arteries all over the body. The two sides of the heart,\r\ntherefore, do not communicate directly with each other, but there is\r\na strong partition between them. In the fœtus the arterial blood from\r\nthe mother, when it leaves the umbilical artery, enters first the\r\nliver, runs through its vessels, gives off the bile found in it, and\r\nthen joins the vena cava inferior. By this passage it is taken into the\r\nright auricle, along with the impure blood of the vena cava. From the\r\nright auricle it passes through a hole in the partition directly into\r\nthe left auricle, instead of taking the indirect route by the lungs as\r\nin the adult. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle,\r\nand is from thence distributed by the arteries all over the body. This\r\nopening in the partition is called the _foramen ovale_!\r\n\r\nAfter birth, when the blood begins to pass through the lungs, this\r\npassage closes up. By the eighth day it is generally obliterated, often\r\nmuch sooner, though occasionally it has remained open longer without\r\ninconvenience. In some cases the foramen ovale does not close at all.\r\nThe child then has what is called the _blue disease_! The whole body is\r\nof a uniform leaden, or blue color, and the whole system is generally\r\nlanguid and sluggish. The blue color is caused by the dark blood of\r\nthe veins mixing with that of the arteries. These children mostly die\r\nearly, but some live to be five or six years old, and one I saw twelve,\r\nbut this is rare. No remedy can be had for this affliction, and I have\r\nnever known it to cure spontaneously. Some children are so very dark\r\nfor a few days after birth as to cause great alarm. This is owing to\r\nthe foramen ovale being very open and closing slowly. No apprehension\r\nneed be experienced in such cases, as it soon subsides.\r\n\r\nThe impure blood from the upper part of the fœtal body, which is\r\nbrought down by the superior vena cava, also enters the right auricle,\r\nbut does not pass from thence through the foramen, like that from the\r\ninferior vena cava. By a peculiar arrangement this blood is made to\r\npass down into the right ventricle, and from thence along the pulmonary\r\nartery, the same as in the adult state. Only a very small portion,\r\nhowever, passes into the lungs, the great part being taken along a\r\ntube called the _ductus arteriosus_ into the great artery called the\r\naorta, where it begins to turn down to the lower part of the body. In\r\nconsequence of this, the arterial blood going down to the lower part of\r\nthe body, is mixed with this portion of impure, venous blood, brought\r\nby the ductus arteriosus from the superior vena cava; while that going\r\nto the head, and upper part of the body remains pure. And this is the\r\nreason why the lower part is always so much smaller than the upper\r\npart, previous to birth; it receives less pure nourishment. The head\r\nand chest appear, at an early period, almost as large as the rest of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance also explains why, in the great majority of cases,\r\nthe _right_ arm is preferred to the _left_, and has more real power.\r\nThe place where the ductus arteriosus pours the impure blood into the\r\naorta, is almost immediately opposite to where the artery is given\r\noff which feeds the left arm. In consequence of which, in most cases,\r\na small portion of this impure blood becomes mixed with the arterial\r\nblood, and the left arm is, therefore, in the same situation as the\r\nlower limbs, and like them is comparatively imperfectly developed.\r\nThe right arm is not liable to any such deprivation. In some cases\r\nthe insertion of the ductus arteriosus is lower down, so that no such\r\nmixture occurs. Both arms are then equal, and this accounts for the\r\nfact that in some persons there appears to be no difference. In some\r\ncases, no doubt, early habit, or imitation, may overcome this natural\r\ninferiority, and even give the preference to the left arm; but such\r\ninstances are rare; the general rule is the contrary, and for the\r\nreason stated.\r\n\r\nThe ductus arteriosus closes up about the same time as the foramen\r\novale.\r\n\r\nThe two veins which convey the impure blood back to the mother, to be\r\npurified, originate from the iliac artery, in the pelvis. They pass up\r\nthe sides of the bladder towards the navel, enter the sheath of the\r\ncord, and so reach the placenta. These vessels are obliterated about\r\nthe third or fourth day after birth, and remain afterwards in the form\r\nof a fibrous cord.\r\n\r\nThe real source of _all_ the blood in the body of the child is a\r\nmystery; it would certainly appear most likely for the whole of it to\r\nbe derived from the mother's vessels, but there are many circumstances\r\nwhich make it probable that the child may form some itself, by\r\ndigesting the fluid it is supposed to absorb. This view is supported by\r\nthe fact that there is found in its bowels at birth, and even before,\r\na greenish substance like excrement, called _Meconium_. This has every\r\nappearance of being the product of digestion, though some suppose it\r\nto be derived from the liver. It occasionally contains hair, and other\r\nanomalous substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BREAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Breasts, or _Mammæ_, are not needed in the process of generation,\r\nnor are they absolutely necessary even after birth; but as they\r\nare naturally associated, in the majority of cases, with infantile\r\nnutrition, and are besides liable to many derangements and diseases\r\nduring pregnancy and child-birth, it is advisable to give some account\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the breasts is dissected it is found to be composed chiefly\r\nof a singular body called the _Mammary Gland_, which resembles somewhat\r\na very firm piece of fat, of a yellowish drab color. In the substance\r\nof this Gland are an immense number of little cells, or vessels, in\r\nwhich, by some unexplainable process, the milk is secreted, or made\r\nfrom the blood. From these little vessels there proceeds small tubes\r\nwhich gradually unite into larger ones, and these again into larger\r\nones still, until at last all the milk is poured into a few tubes,\r\nor canals, which terminate in the nipple. The outer mouths of these\r\nterminal canals are only slightly contracted together, so that the\r\nsuction of the child's mouth, or even the pressure of the milk, when\r\nthe breast is full, will force them open and allow the fluid to flow\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe following plate represents the structure of the Breast, and\r\nexplains, as far as it can be explained, the manner in which it\r\nperforms its functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XII.--_a._\r\n\r\n  _a. a._ The cut edges of the skin.--_b. b._ The flaps of the skin\r\n  thrown back.--_c. c. c._ The fat which covers the breast.--_d. d._\r\n  The cells of the Mammary gland.--_e. e. e._ The Tubes or canals,\r\n  which convey the milk from the Gland to the Nipple.--_f._ The Nipple,\r\n  cut down the middle, to show the ends of the milk tubes terminating\r\n  in it; these are usually about fifteen or eighteen in number.--_x._\r\n  Shows a bunch of the little cells, with the tubes proceeding from\r\n  them, as they appear when injected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FEMALE BREAST.\r\n\r\nPlate XII.--_a._\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the structure of the Breast, and explains the\r\nmanner in which it performs its functions.]\r\n\r\nSometimes there has been seen two and even three nipples on one breast,\r\nand in a few cases one of the breasts has had no nipple at all. The\r\ntwo glands are not immediately connected, but have a very intimate\r\nsympathy with each other. The size of the breast depends more upon the\r\nthickness of the layer of fatty substance, than upon the development\r\nof the gland, so that one female, with a very full bosom, may have\r\nbut little milk, while another, whose breast is but little prominent,\r\nmay have a superabundance. The graceful swell of the fully developed\r\nbreast is, however, a matter of positive utility, as well as of beauty,\r\nbecause it better adapts it to the use of the child, and probably\r\nalso adds to its _pleasure_, as any one may readily conceive who will\r\nobserve the delight with which an infant, even when not nursing, will\r\noften caress it. Sir Astley Cooper says, \"The natural obliquity of the\r\nMamella, or nipple, forwards and outwards, with a slight turn of the\r\nnipple upwards, is one of the most beautiful provisions in nature, both\r\nfor the mother and the child. To the mother, because the child rests\r\nupon her arm and lap in the most convenient position for sucking; for\r\nif the nipple and breast had projected directly forwards, the child\r\nmust have been supported before her, in the mother's hands, in a most\r\ninconvenient and fatiguing position, instead of it reclining upon her\r\nside and arm. But it is wisely provided by nature, that when the child\r\nreposes upon its mother's arm it has its mouth directly applied to the\r\nnipple, which is turned outwards to receive it, whilst the lower part\r\nof the breast forms a _cushion_, upon which the cheek of the infant\r\ntranquilly reposes.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the dark _areola_, or circle, and the little\r\ntubercles around the nipple, the breast is of the most delicate\r\nstructure and color, so that it blushes, or reddens, like the cheek,\r\nfrom any sudden emotion, and goes pale during fainting.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule no milk is secreted in those who have not become\r\npregnant, nor in those who have passed the turn of life, but\r\noccasionally exceptions are observed to this rule.\r\n\r\nBandelocque tells us of a girl only _eight_ years of age, who suckled\r\nher little brother more than a month! And Sir Hans Sloane tells us of\r\na lady aged _sixty eight_, who nursed several of her grandchildren,\r\nthough she had had no child herself for twenty years! Dr. Francis, of\r\nNew York, describes the case of a lady who continued to secrete milk\r\nregularly for _fourteen years_ after having lost her child, so that\r\nshe could always nurse an infant; and Dr. Kennedy relates an instance\r\nof another who continued to suckle children, uninterruptedly, for\r\n_forty-seven years_, and who had milk perfectly sweet and good even\r\nwhen _eighty-one years old_! Dr. Clark, of Alabama, informs us that\r\na married lady, who had never been pregnant, was requested to take\r\ncharge of an infant during the night, and that to quiet it she had put\r\nher nipple in its mouth. This was done frequently, and to the great\r\nsurprise of all it induced a flow of milk. A singular circumstance\r\nconnected with this was that the lady soon after became _pregnant_,\r\nthough previously barren! This will not appear so surprising, however,\r\nto those who know the connection between the breasts and the womb,\r\nand who have observed the mysterious bond of sympathy by which their\r\nfunctions are united.--(See the articles on _Menstruation_, and on\r\n_Sterility_, in my \"Diseases of Woman,\" for other instances of this\r\nkind.)\r\n\r\nThe structure of the male breast is precisely the same as that of\r\nthe female, but it is seldom developed. Instances have been known,\r\nhowever, of the milk being secreted in men, and of children having\r\nbeen nourished by it! Humboldt gives us an instance of this kind, and\r\nProfessor Hull, of Maryland, exhibited a colored man to his class, in\r\nthe year 1827, who had a large full bosom, like a female, and who had\r\noften officiated as _wet nurse_ in the family of his mistress. The\r\nsecretion appears to have been established by his putting the children\r\nthat he had to nurse to the nipple, to quiet them. When the milk was\r\nnot needed it was found as difficult to dry it up as it is in some\r\nfemales, but it was soon made to flow again, by applying a child to the\r\nbreast for a few times. This man differed _in no other respect_ from\r\nany other man!\r\n\r\nIn the females of some races of the human kind, the mammæ attain a\r\nsurprising length, and become very flaccid, so that they hang down\r\nto the hips, or lower, and may be thrown over the shoulder for the\r\nchild to nurse from while carried on the back. Some suppose this to\r\nconstitute a real variety of the human race, but others suppose it to\r\nresult merely from habit, which is probably correct.\r\n\r\nWhen the breasts are small sized in young females, their growth may\r\noften be promoted, but the means need not be pointed out here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF PREGNANCY, AND THE MEANS OF DETECTING IT; ITS DURATION, AND\r\nTHE PERIOD AT WHICH THE FŒTUS CAN LIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always desirable, and frequently of the first importance, to\r\nbe able to know whether a female is pregnant or not, both to the\r\naccoucheur and to the individual, or even to be able to judge whether\r\nshe is probably or possibly so, or not. Sometimes this can be decided\r\npositively, but more frequently it is a matter of great uncertainty.\r\nThe presumptive and positive signs on which a judgment can be formed\r\nare of various kinds, most of which can be readily observed, and easily\r\nmade use of by any person in possession of the information already\r\ngiven in the preceding section. They will be set forth in the following\r\nChapters, together with such other matter as appertains to this part of\r\nthe subject, in such a manner as will make them available either for\r\nprofessional or for private use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF PREGNANCY, AND THE MEANS OF DETECTING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe signs of Pregnancy are of three kinds--Presumptive, Probable, and\r\nCertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESUMPTIVE SIGNS.\r\n\r\nThe presumptive signs of pregnancy are only of value in the first\r\n_three months_. They consist mainly of certain nervous and organic\r\nderangements, and of certain changes in personal appearance. It is\r\nscarcely possible to enumerate all these, nor is it necessary; we shall\r\ntherefore only specify those most important, and most generally met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nColic pains, and creeping of the skin, with shuddering and fainting\r\nfits, very frequently follow _immediately on conception_, and in many\r\nfemales inform them when that event occurs. Some persons speak of\r\nother sensations, of a peculiar nature, by which they _always_ know,\r\nin their own cases, when they conceive; but these sensations are felt\r\nby so few, and are so little capable of being explained or observed,\r\nthat they are of no general use. In most cases, within the first\r\nthree months, and sometimes in the first three days, the face changes\r\nremarkably. The eyes are sunk and dull, and surrounded by a black\r\ncircle, the nose seems pinched up, the skin turns pale, and red spots,\r\nor freckles, frequently appear. Many females also complain of a husky\r\ndry throat, numbness in the hands and feet, and a sudden sinking at\r\nthe heart. These signs, however, are very uncertain guides; very often\r\nnone of these are felt at all during pregnancy, and sometimes they are\r\nall experienced from other causes. One of the most constant signs,\r\naccording to some, and the most to be relied upon, is an _increase in\r\nthe size of the neck_. This I know is often very apparent, and at a\r\nvery early period. I am acquainted with females who, by simply keeping\r\nthe measure of their necks, can always tell when they are pregnant.\r\nThe increase is often considerable in a few days. In young persons of\r\na certain temperament however, the neck is apt to swell merely from\r\n_marriage_, though they do not conceive; and some old nurses, we are\r\ntold, being acquainted with this fact, judge of the honesty of their\r\nunmarried charges by such admeasurements!\r\n\r\nThis singular development is owing, probably, to a sympathetic\r\nconnection between the uterine organs and certain parts of the brain,\r\nand large nerves in the neck.\r\n\r\n_Suppression of the Menses_ is one of the strongest presumptive signs\r\nof pregnancy that can be observed, but does not always _accompany_\r\nit, and frequently arises from other causes. In the great majority of\r\ncases, it is true, the menses cease to flow, immediately conception\r\noccurs; sometimes they will continue for one or more periods after, and\r\noccasionally during the whole time of gestation, even up to a few days\r\nbefore delivery. This, however, is a very unusual occurrence, and the\r\nstoppage of the menses is by no means so strong a sign that pregnancy\r\n_has_ occurred, as their continuance is that it has _not_. Some females\r\nare always irregular, so that pregnancy makes little difference, and\r\nin them of course these signs are even less to be depended upon than\r\nusual. There have cases been known even of women who have conceived\r\nwithout having _menstruated_, and of others who never menstruated\r\nexcept when they were pregnant; and it is not at all unusual to see\r\nothers who will conceive while nursing, and never menstruate between\r\nthe two pregnancies. Therefore we can only say that the menses\r\n_usually_ stop when conception occurs, and that their continuance is\r\nstrong evidence that it has not occurred, but still both signs may fail.\r\n\r\nIt is also proper to remark that several medical men have advanced\r\nthe opinion that the discharge which appears during pregnancy is not\r\nthe menstrual fluid, but real blood. It has however been accurately\r\nexamined, and found in no respect to differ from the usual discharge.\r\nIn my own opinion there is no doubt but that some females really do\r\nmenstruate while pregnant.\r\n\r\nAs an instance that the presence of the menses is no proof that\r\npregnancy has _not_ occurred, I give the following case:--Not long\r\nsince I was requested to see a lady who was supposed to labor under\r\na polypus in the womb. She had been married six years, but had no\r\noffspring. On seeing her I suggested, from certain peculiarities in\r\nher appearance and manner, that _possibly_ she might be pregnant. The\r\nsuggestion was met with a smile, particularly by the medical attendant\r\nwho was present, and I was told that there was no sign of such a thing,\r\nand moreover it _could not be_, for she had never stopped menstruating,\r\nnor was there the slightest change in the breasts, nor any disturbance\r\nin the stomach, mind, or feelings. On making the usual examination\r\nhowever, I felt fully _convinced_ I was right, and told them so, but\r\nmy opinion had no other effect than to induce them not to interfere\r\nfor a time. They had been talking of an _operation_ immediately. She\r\nstill continued to menstruate for three months after, but in six weeks\r\nfrom her last period was safely delivered, without assistance, of a\r\nvery fine living child. No part of the body had undergone any material\r\nchange, except the abdomen, though many of the usual changes occurred\r\nafter delivery. In this case the delay probably saved the lives of both\r\nmother and child, and deeply grateful they all were for the escape.\r\nIn my work on the Diseases of Woman many fatal cases will be found of\r\npregnant females who have been killed from mistakes of this kind, owing\r\nto a blind reliance on such uncertain signs.\r\n\r\n_Disturbance of the Digestive Functions._--It is very seldom, indeed,\r\nthat pregnancy does not produce more or less disturbance in these\r\nfunctions, though it must be remarked that _marriage_ also does the\r\nsame sometimes, even without conception. These disturbances are\r\ngenerally manifested by loss of appetite; sickness, particularly in\r\nthe morning; vomiting, and depraved taste; the individual frequently\r\ntaking a fancy to the most extraordinary articles, and making herself\r\nextremely unhappy if she cannot obtain them. Thus some have eaten\r\nflies, spiders, mice, and other living things, and others again have\r\nregaled themselves upon charcoal, chalk, slate pencils, and even earth\r\nor ashes. Such freaks are called _longings_, and it is thought highly\r\nimproper not to indulge them, which is certainly right when they are\r\nfor articles not positively injurious; but I have known this notion\r\ncarried to a very injurious and absurd extent. There is no doubt but\r\nthese vagaries of the stomach arise, mainly, from its sympathy with the\r\nuterus, but it is highly probable that they are often exaggerated, and\r\nfrequently even produced, by a morbid state of the sensibilities, and\r\nby vacuity of mind. The tendency to imitation also, so strong in most\r\nfemales, often leads to the same result. A young female who is declared\r\nto be, or who fancies herself, pregnant, listens eagerly to all that\r\nis said about that interesting state, by older acquaintances, and when\r\ntold that _they_ always _longed_, immediately begins to long also. I\r\nhave known young persons considerably advanced in gestation, who had\r\nnever longed at all before, do so immediately after a conversation of\r\nthis kind. It must be remembered however, that the sympathies of the\r\ndigestive organs with the womb are very strong, and that the appetite\r\nand taste are frequently rendered very capricious at this time, so\r\nthat the female really likes or dislikes many things that she did not\r\nbefore; but still I feel convinced that the absurd ways in which this\r\ncaprice exhibits itself, are often owing to the causes I have stated.\r\nThe wondering ignorance, in which most females are kept, makes them\r\ndisposed to be led away by a morbid imagination, and constantly liable\r\nto be imposed upon by silly and erroneous statements, which they of\r\ncourse implicitly believe. These longings are always the strangest, and\r\nmost frequently met with, among the most uninformed and unthinking,\r\nthough they are occasionally met with under all circumstances. As a\r\nsign of pregnancy this longing is not much to be relied upon alone,\r\nbecause marriage alone often produces it, and so do many uterine\r\nderangements.\r\n\r\nUsually all these disturbances disappear by the third or fourth month,\r\nthe appetite becomes regular, and sometimes even voracious, and the\r\ndigestion improves, so that the individual may become quite fat, though\r\npreviously she was very thin.\r\n\r\nSome suffer from constipation, and others from diarrhœa, but this is\r\nmore rare.\r\n\r\n_Nervous Derangements._--The changes produced in the minds and feelings\r\nof pregnant females are sometimes of the most extraordinary character.\r\nIndividuals who possess, ordinarily, the most agreeable tempers, and\r\nthe most amiable dispositions, will become peevish and fretful, and\r\noften even violently passionate and malicious. Some have even been\r\nknown to have a disposition to commit various crimes, of which they had\r\nthe greatest horror in their natural state. Others, on the contrary,\r\nwho are usually ill-tempered and unhappy, attain a charming tenderness\r\nof manner, and a most pleasing serenity of mind. Their likings and\r\ndislikings also change very much, so that their most valued friends\r\nwill become hateful to them, and those whom they habitually dislike\r\nwill seem endowed with every loveable quality. Some will become perfect\r\nmisanthropes, or weep and fret without intermission, while others will\r\nexhibit the most reckless and boisterous gaiety. I have known some much\r\ndisposed to study while pregnant, and others who would draw, or paint,\r\nmost excellently, though at other times they were but indifferent\r\nartists. In short, it is impossible to denote half the singular changes\r\nof this kind that are thus produced. Suffice it to say that, when well\r\nmarked, they are strong presumptive signs of pregnancy, especially\r\nwhen coming in connection with other evidences. It must be remembered\r\nhowever, that hysteria, and some other uterine diseases, are often\r\naccompanied by similar changes.\r\n\r\n_Alteration in the appearance of the Breast._--The direct, and\r\nsympathetic connection between the womb and the breast is so great that\r\npregnancy usually causes corresponding changes in both, though not\r\nalways. In most cases however, the breasts swell, and become painful.\r\nThe nipple becomes elevated, and the circle around it assumes a dark\r\nbrown color, and is dotted with small tubercles, from which a thin\r\nwatery liquor may often be pressed. The nipple will also enlarge, or\r\nbecome erect on being rubbed, and, as gestation advances, milk may\r\nbe forced from it. Most of these signs however, may be wanting in\r\npregnancy, and may arise independent of it. Chronic inflammation, and\r\nother diseases of the womb, will frequently produce them, as may be\r\nseen in my \"Diseases of Woman.\" _Marriage_ alone frequently causes\r\nsuch symptoms, particularly in certain temperaments, and deranged\r\nmenstruation will frequently produce them.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in the color of the areola, or circle round the nipple,\r\nis a sign much relied upon by some, but is frequently a deceptive one,\r\nmerely from want of close observation. I have known many females,\r\nthough frequently mothers, whose breasts always retained the bright\r\nrosy color they had previous to marriage; and I have known young\r\nunmarried females with the breasts quite dark. The peculiar hue that\r\narises from pregnancy however, is different from anything I ever saw in\r\nnon-pregnant females; and, though not always to be met with, is, in my\r\nopinion, an infallible sign when present. The celebrated John Hunter\r\nregarded this sign as an unmistakeable one, and he gave a remarkable\r\ninstance of it in his lectures. In making a _post mortem_ examination\r\nof the body of a young female, he observed this peculiar color, and\r\nat once proclaimed her pregnant, _though the hymen was unbroken_.\r\nOn dissection he was found to be correct--she was four months\r\nadvanced. If this sign were constant, pregnancy could nearly always be\r\nascertained, but frequently it does not appear. The peculiar color must\r\nbe seen to be recognized, as it cannot be accurately described; perhaps\r\nthe nearest approach to it is the shell of a fresh _ripe chestnut_, but\r\nit is much darker in some than in others. The dark circle is nearly\r\nalways more elevated than the rest of the breast, as may be seen by\r\ntaking a profile view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n_View of the Breast about the Fourth Month._--_a. a._ The Breast.--_b._\r\nThe Nipple.--_c._ The Areola, or part which becomes brown; it is\r\nelevated above the rest of the Breast, as may be seen.--_d. d._ The\r\nlittle Tubercles.]\r\n\r\nMost frequently the breasts do not swell, nor the areola change color,\r\nnor the tubercles appear, till about the fourth month, and frequently\r\nmuch later.\r\n\r\nAll these changes in the breast are also liable to become more or less\r\npermanent, after the first pregnancy, so that they are of much less\r\nservice, and less to be depended upon, in all succeeding ones. They\r\nalso remain, with most females, during nursing, and are therefore not\r\navailable in those who conceive while they are nursing. On the whole\r\nhowever, these signs, especially in those not previously pregnant,\r\nmay be pretty confidently relied upon, and will seldom deceive an\r\nexperienced observer.\r\n\r\n_The secretion of milk_ is, by most persons, considered a positive sign\r\nof pregnancy, but it is not so, for it sometimes takes place in young\r\ngirls merely from the establishment of puberty, and in some females\r\nit always occurs at each monthly period, though they have never been\r\npregnant. Instances have been known of women nursing other people's\r\nchildren though they had never conceived themselves.\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous signs._--There are a few other presumptive signs, not\r\neasily classified, some of which are of value, while others are so\r\nuncertain, or so little available, as to be almost worthless. All these\r\nhowever, it is necessary to point out, because some of them may be made\r\nuse of in cases where the more ordinary signs are absent.\r\n\r\nIn the unimpregnated state the mucus membrane, which lines the Vagina,\r\nis of a bright rose color, but in nearly every case of pregnancy it\r\nchanges to a bluish, or purplish hue. I do not recollect a single\r\ninstance, in the course of my own observation, in which this change\r\nhas not occurred, and the same statement is made by several eminent\r\nauthors. It is true that in some young females the mucus lining is\r\nnaturally darker than it is in others, but, like the areola round the\r\nnipple, this natural tinge is not like that produced by pregnancy. It\r\nis of course impossible to say whether this blue tinge is _always_\r\nproduced, though I am inclined to think it is, and I should certainly\r\nconsider it an almost infallible sign when present. Parent Duchatelet\r\nstates that he was present when M. Jacquemin proved this, without a\r\nsingle failure, _in four thousand five hundred cases_.\r\n\r\nMany females are also warned of their condition by pains in various\r\nparts of their bodies, the most frequent of which is one felt at _the\r\ntop of the head_. Some always have palpitation at the heart, and others\r\nexperience a singular kind of _fluttering_ in the womb.\r\n\r\nMany medical men rely altogether on certain peculiarities in the\r\n_urine_, and as this sign is really a valuable one, in some cases, I\r\nwill describe the mode of examination fully. The urine is put in a\r\nclean vessel, and allowed to stand perfectly still. In a short time,\r\nvarying from two to six days, a number of little opaque bodies begin to\r\nrise from the bottom, like flocks of cotton, which unite together at\r\nthe top into a thin but firm layer, or pellicle, like cream on the top\r\nof milk. This layer is frequently so consistent that it can almost be\r\nraised out of the vessel, by taking hold of one edge, and may be easily\r\ndrawn out by passing the finger under it. This substance is called\r\n_kyestein_. It is of a whitish color, semi-transparent, and looks as if\r\nit were partly crystalized. After a few days, if left undisturbed, the\r\nurine becomes thick and muddy, and the pellicle of kyestein breaks up\r\nand falls to the bottom. According to the experience of many medical\r\nmen, and so far as I have seen myself, this peculiar substance is\r\n_always_ to be found in the urine of pregnant females, after the first\r\nmonth, and frequently even earlier. Sometimes a substance _similar_ to\r\nit is observed in the urine of those not pregnant, but there is, in\r\nmost of these cases, sufficient difference between them to enable any\r\none, who has seen both, to distinguish one from the other. The only\r\ntime, except during gestation, when real kyestein appears to be formed,\r\nis while the milk is being secreted and not freely discharged. Thus it\r\nmay often be found when the female is weaning, and, some writers assure\r\nus, in some cases during the whole period of nursing. On the whole\r\nthis sign is a very valuable one, and may be much relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the pulse, on which some persons rely, are of no value\r\nwhatever as a sign of pregnancy, since they are no more frequent, and\r\nnot at all different, so far as I have seen, from what ordinarily occur\r\nfrom other causes.\r\n\r\nThe development of the abdomen, though an invariable accompaniment\r\nof pregnancy, is by no means a certain sign of it, since it may be\r\nproduced by other causes; and besides, it is sometimes but little to\r\nbe observed till a late period. The peculiar manner of the development\r\nhowever, is usually somewhat different from that produced by tumors,\r\nand other diseases. Very often the abdomen will be tolerably large by\r\nthe second month, and then again become so much smaller that the female\r\nwill think she is certainly not pregnant. This is owing chiefly to\r\nflatulence, produced by digestive disturbance during the early periods,\r\nbut which afterwards subsides. In a short time however, the uterus not\r\nonly enlarges more, but rises, and the development becomes permanent.\r\nThis circumstance of there being often _two_ developments has deceived\r\nmany, and I have known females declared to be not pregnant, simply\r\nbecause the development of the abdomen went down, who, in a short time\r\nafter, exhibited unequivocal evidences of being in that condition.\r\nThe first development, or swelling, is merely similar to what often\r\narises from indigestion, and other causes, and is therefore no sign of\r\npregnancy; but the second development is accompanied by other changes,\r\nbesides being more permanent.\r\n\r\nThe linea alba, or white line, which may be seen extending from the\r\nnavel to the pubis, in the ordinary state, becomes much darker, the\r\nskin of the abdomen wrinkles, and the umbilicus, or navel, becomes\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the eyelids, and puffing of the face, are experienced by\r\nsome females, but are not very general, and so frequently result from\r\nother causes that they are of little value as evidences in this case.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, comprises all the presumptive signs of Pregnancy that\r\nare worthy of notice. Some of them are valuable and may be depended\r\nupon, particularly the presence of kyestein in the urine, which may\r\nalmost be called a _certain_ sign. Others of them are of little value\r\nalone, but are useful in the way of corroboration. The more there are\r\nof them observed together, in any case, of course the more grounds\r\nthere are for the _presumption_ that pregnancy exists, and the reverse.\r\n\r\nIt must be carefully remembered however, that these presumptive signs\r\nare precisely those most likely to be produced by other causes,\r\nparticularly by _marriage only_; they must therefore be well weighed,\r\nand unless very numerous, or very distinctly marked, must not be\r\nregarded as conclusive. As already remarked, it is only during _the\r\nfirst three months_ that most of these presumptive signs are taken much\r\nnotice of; after that we have others that can be more depended upon,\r\nand which will be described in the succeeding articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE SIGNS.\r\n\r\n_End of the third month._--The probable signs now to be described are\r\nseldom recognized before this time, and not generally with distinctness\r\ntill a still later period. They chiefly consist of certain changes in\r\nthe form, development, and position of different parts of the uterus,\r\nto ascertain which requires an internal examination. These changes are\r\nnot observable till the end of the third month, previous to which time\r\nwe cannot be certain that the womb has really increased beyond its\r\nnormal size. And even then, when the increase is obvious, we cannot\r\ntell how it has been produced; it is not till a much later period, till\r\nfive or six, or even seven months are elapsed, that pregnancy can be\r\nascertained with anything like certainty.\r\n\r\nThe changes to be noticed are in the form, and size, of the neck and\r\nbody of the womb, and in its mouth, and also in the weight of the whole\r\norgan. No one, of course, can expect to recognize these changes who is\r\nnot acquainted with the parts in the unimpregnated state, both in the\r\nvirgin and in those who have borne children.\r\n\r\nThe mode of conducting the requisite examination is, by introducing\r\nthe index finger of the right hand, covered with oil or mucilage,\r\ninto the Vagina, and then carrying it upwards till it reaches the Os\r\nTincæ. By means of this finger the position and length of the neck of\r\nthe womb are ascertained, and also the state of its mouth, whether it\r\nis opened or closed, and to what extent. If it be then placed at the\r\ntop of the neck, on the under side, and the other hand upon the fundus\r\nof the womb externally, and pressing firmly upon it, the organ is\r\nenclosed as it were between the two hands, so that its size and form\r\nmay be pretty accurately ascertained, and also its degree of firmness,\r\nby which a judgment may be formed as to whether it is occupied by any\r\nsolid body, or fluid, or whether it is empty. In addition to this a\r\npretty accurate estimate may be made of its comparative _weight_, by\r\n_balancing_, and raising it up on the finger. This is called by the\r\nFrench _Ballotment_, and, as will be shown further on, is a valuable\r\nmeans, at certain stages, of ascertaining pregnancy.--(See Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\nThe female may be examined either standing or lying down, though the\r\nrecumbent position is best, except in certain displacements of the\r\nwomb, when it is most likely to be thrown into a position in which\r\nthe neck can easily be reached by the female standing. The position\r\nof the neck is very different in many of these displacements, and\r\nduring pregnancy, to what it is in the ordinary state, and a person not\r\nacquainted with these changes might frequently be much puzzled to find\r\nit. As we have already remarked, also, there are certain differences\r\nbetween those who have had children and those who have not. The\r\nfollowing three diagrams represent the changes just spoken of at three\r\ndifferent periods:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n  _Figure 1_, represents the form and size of the body, neck, and mouth\r\n  of the Womb, at about the third month.\r\n\r\n  _Figure 2_, the same at about the seventh month.\r\n\r\n  _Figure 3_, the same at the ninth month.\r\n\r\n  The references are the same in all. _a._ The Neck of the Womb.--_b.\r\n  b._ The Body of the Womb.--_c._ The Os Tincæ, or Mouth of the\r\n  Womb.--_d. d._ The cut edges of the Vagina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nFig. 3.\r\n\r\nPlate XIV.\r\n\r\nThe form and size of the body, neck, and mouth of the Womb, at about\r\nthe third, seventh and ninth months.]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen by these diagrams that the alterations in\r\nthe neck and mouth of the womb are very marked, and of a character\r\neasily to be ascertained by the touch. These three should be compared\r\nwith the section of the womb in Plate IV, which represents it in the\r\nunimpregnated state.\r\n\r\nThe difference between those who have borne children, and those\r\nwho have not, is well represented in Plate XV,--the drawings being\r\none-third of the natural size, and representing the appearance at about\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nPrimipara, or the first Pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWoman who has borne children before.\r\n\r\n_a. a._ The neck of the Womb.--_b. b. b._ The body of the Womb.--_c._\r\nThe Os Tincæ, or mouth of the Womb.--_d. d._ The cut edges of the\r\nVagina.--_e_. The Fœtus.--_f. f._ The Fallopian Tubes, Ovaries, and\r\nRound Ligaments.--_g._ The Placenta.]\r\n\r\nMost of the changes produced can be readily distinguished by the\r\nfinger, after seeing this representation, and making a proper\r\ncomparison between it and the natural state in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nThe Neck is not much enlarged at this period, but its lower part is\r\nsomewhat soft to the feeling. The Os Tincæ is more _rounded_ than in\r\nthe unimpregnated state, particularly in the Primipara, in whom in fact\r\nit is nearly circular, the lips being quite smooth and closed. In the\r\nfemale who has already borne children it is somewhat open, so that the\r\nfinger may often be introduced; and the lips feel rough, owing to scars\r\nand laceration in previous deliveries. It is also larger altogether,\r\nand softer, than in the primipara. The whole length of the neck at this\r\nstage is about two inches.\r\n\r\nThe body of the uterus, when pressed between the two hands, will be\r\nfound much larger than ordinary, and more round, and it will feel heavy\r\nwhen pushed up by the finger.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the precise value of these probable signs, it can only\r\nbe said, when they are observed, that it is certain that the womb\r\nis enlarged, and _most probably_ from pregnancy. But at the same\r\ntime it must be remembered that several diseases, and particularly\r\nsuppressed and irregular menstruation, or the development of tumors and\r\npolypi, will effect very similar changes, and that it is not _always_\r\npossible to say whether they arise from these abnormal growths or from\r\npregnancy, though it can generally be done. But though we cannot,\r\nin every case, say when these signs exist, that the female must be\r\npregnant, we can nearly always say, when they do not exist, that she\r\ncannot be so, particularly if the other usual signs are absent.\r\n\r\n_End of the fourth month._--By this time the neck has become a little\r\nshorter still, and the mouth more open, but on the whole there is\r\nnot much change to be felt internally. The body of the womb however,\r\nhas now ascended above the superior strait of the Pelvis, and begins\r\npermanently to enlarge the Abdomen. It may be distinctly felt between\r\nthe two hands, like a firm round ball, somewhat elastic, and resisting\r\nwhen pressed. This is the period when the motions of the fœtus are\r\nusually felt first, and these motions, with the ascension of the womb,\r\nare sometimes experienced very suddenly, so as to alarm the female,\r\nand produce certain curious sensations, with much nervous derangement.\r\nThis is called _quickening_, and, with some persons, is always so well\r\nmarked as to indicate not only their condition, but the very period,\r\nwith great precision. Many however, never experience anything at all\r\npeculiar at this time.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the medical attendant, as a means of making the\r\nchild move, to put his hand first in cold water, and then over the\r\nfundus of the uterus; the sensation of cold thus conveyed usually\r\ncausing it to move immediately. Great care must be taken however,\r\nthat other motions be not mistaken for those of the child, an error\r\nnot at all uncommon. Many a female, and many a medical man also, has\r\nbeen deceived in this way, particularly in cases of uterine or ovarian\r\ndropsy, and tumor, and even in ordinary flatulence and hysteria.\r\nFemales who much desire offspring frequently deceive themselves in this\r\nway, and it is sometimes next to impossible to convince them of their\r\nerror. Some women possess the power of _imitating_ the movements of\r\nthe child, with great exactness; and instances have been known where\r\nthey have successfully imposed, both on their friends and medical\r\nattendants, for a long time, in this way. Mr. Dubois mentions instances\r\nof females who possessed this extraordinary power, and who, though not\r\npregnant, used to present themselves to his class, for the pupils to\r\n_ascertain the motions of the child_. In short, this sign must not be\r\ntoo much relied upon, nor too confidently expected, for many females\r\nobserve no fœtal motions at all till the sixth or seventh month,\r\nand even then very indistinctly. Sometimes also, after having been\r\ndistinctly felt, these motions will altogether stop for a long time,\r\nand then appear again.\r\n\r\nAt this time however, _Ballotment_ can begin to be practised, though it\r\nis not quite so certain as at a month later. The manner of performing\r\nthis important manipulation has already been partly described, and by\r\nexamining Plate XVI, and attending to the following remarks, it may be\r\nreadily understood and practised.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n  This Plate represents the mode of performing the Ballotment, to\r\n  detect pregnancy. The outline of the figure is the same as in Plate\r\n  I, and most of the organs are lettered the same.\r\n\r\n  The index finger of the right hand is passed into the Vagina till it\r\n  touches the body of the Womb, the neck being thrown back, owing to\r\n  the tilting of the Fundus forward. The left hand is pressed firmly\r\n  upon the Abdomen, just over the pubic bone.\r\n\r\n  1, Is the Fœtus.--2, The Placenta, connected with the Fœtus by\r\n  the cord.--3, Is the index finger of the right hand, within the\r\n  Vagina.--4, Is the left hand.\r\n\r\n  The development of the Womb, and the change in its position, are very\r\n  well represented in the Plate, and so are the alterations in some of\r\n  the other organs. The manner in which the Bladder, A, is pressed out\r\n  of its usual shape and size, may be seen by comparing this with Plate\r\n  I. The shortening of the Vagina, and the expansion of its upper part,\r\n  are also equally obvious, and the manner in which the mouth of the\r\n  Womb is thrown back against the Rectum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVI.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the mode of performing the Ballotment, to detect\r\npregnancy. The outline of the figure is the same as in Plate I, and\r\nmost of the organs are lettered the same.]\r\n\r\nWhen the right hand finger (1 Plate XVI,) is carried to the top of the\r\nVagina, it meets with a round soft tumor, which is the head of the\r\nchild felt through the walls of the womb. As soon as this is distinctly\r\nfelt, the finger must be withdrawn a little, and then pushed suddenly\r\nagainst the tumor with a jerk; this will displace the fœtus, and cause\r\nit to rise in the liquor amnii towards the Fundus, so that the round\r\ntumor will have disappeared. In a few moments it will sink down and\r\nmay be again felt, and again displaced in the same manner. This is\r\ncalled the _Ballotment_, or balancing it on the end of the finger. The\r\nsensation conveyed on touching the Fœtus, and when it rises after being\r\npushed, are so peculiar that they are not likely to be overlooked, or\r\nmistaken for anything else, after being once experienced. The jerk is\r\nnot required to be at all violent, and had better be made at first\r\nvery slight, as it can easily be repeated a little more forcibly if\r\nthe tumor does not rise at first. Some practitioners practice the\r\nBallotment in this way, using the one hand only; but others place the\r\nleft hand also on the Abdomen, (4 Plate XVI,) at the same time, and\r\nimmediately after jerking _upwards_ with the right hand, they suddenly\r\ndepress the Abdomen, just over the pubes, with the fingers of the left,\r\nso as to send the Fœtus down again more quickly and more forcibly. This\r\nis seldom needed, but if the first way does not succeed the two hands\r\nmay be tried.\r\n\r\nA species of ballotment may even be practised externally, in the\r\nfollowing way:--The fingers of the right hand are placed on the\r\nAbdomen, just over the fundus of the womb, like the left hand in Plate\r\nXVI, and a smart jerk is given downwards and backwards, several times\r\nin quick succession. This also displaces the Fœtus, which may be\r\ndistinctly felt to float away, each time the percussion is made. No one\r\ncan mistake this peculiar motion who has once felt it.\r\n\r\nSometimes one of these manœuvres will succeed when the other fails, so\r\nthat it is well to practise them all. They may be performed with the\r\nfemale either standing or lying down, and will sometimes succeed one\r\nway when they will not the other.\r\n\r\nIt is requisite to remember that in presentations of the breech,\r\nor trunk, the ballotment may not succeed as well as when the head\r\npresents; or it may even fail altogether, so that when it is\r\nunsuccessful we must not immediately conclude there is no pregnancy.\r\nTumors in the womb, stone in the bladder, and various uterine\r\ndisplacements, may also create uncertainty, or cause failure, but these\r\naccidents are rarely met with, and only interfere materially at an\r\nearly stage; afterwards ballotment can be practised notwithstanding\r\nthem, or auscultation may be resorted to.\r\n\r\nIn short, this mode of detecting pregnancy is one of the most certain,\r\nand the most generally applicable, that we possess.\r\n\r\n_End of the fifth month._--At this time the Uterus has increased\r\nconsiderably in size, and has ascended so high in the Abdomen that the\r\nFundus is level with the umbilicus, or navel, in a first pregnancy,\r\nthough somewhat lower in those who have borne children before. This\r\nrising of the womb makes the Vagina longer, and brings the neck of the\r\nwomb nearer to its centre. In the previous stage the neck was thrown\r\nso far back that it was difficult to reach, but now it is much more\r\nfavorably situated, though much higher. Its substance is softer than\r\nbefore, and the two lips are nearly on a level, and somewhat opened,\r\nparticularly in those who have borne children before. Indeed, in them\r\nthe point of the finger may be introduced, as seen below:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nNeck of the Womb in a first Pregnancy, very slightly opened.\r\n\r\nNeck of the Womb in a female who has borne children before, showing how\r\nit admits of the introduction of the finger.\r\n\r\nThis is at the end of the Fifth Month, and the drawings are about\r\none-third of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nBallotment is now much more easily practised, and is more conclusive.\r\nA new sign is also to be distinguished, by which we are furnished with\r\nanother valuable means of detecting pregnancy. The child's heart begins\r\nto beat so strongly, and its circulation is so vigorous, that the\r\n_sound_ of it can be _heard_ externally. The same means are taken to\r\nascertain this that are used in sounding the chest of an adult. If the\r\near be placed on the Abdomen, over the womb, the beating of the fœtal\r\nheart may be heard quite plainly; and if the stethoscope be used it\r\nwill be still more distinct. This practice is called _Auscultation_.\r\nThe signs furnished by it are certainly of the greatest value, and\r\nfrequently enable us to detect pregnancy with unerring certainty.\r\nIndeed, not only can we tell by them that a child is in the womb, but\r\noften even _the very position in which it lies_, and whether there be\r\n_twins_, _or more_. This is done by noting where the heart is situated,\r\nby the sound, and whether the beating is single or double.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these sounds, and the manner of detecting them, require\r\nto be carefully explained.\r\n\r\nIf the person wishing to notice this sign is not already familiar with\r\nthe beating of the adult heart, he had better become so first. The ear\r\nshould be placed on the left side of a grown up person, on the skin,\r\njust beneath the breast, and held very still. The heart will then be\r\nheard to beat very distinctly, there being two sounds, a long one and a\r\nshort one, alternating with each other. When this has been listened to\r\nfor some time, the ear will be able to catch any similar sound, and the\r\nauscultation may then be practised to detect pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe ear must be placed on the Abdomen, about midway between the Pubes\r\nand the umbilicus, and towards the left side. No weight should be borne\r\non the body, but the ear must be laid sufficiently close to exclude all\r\nexternal sounds, and no motion should take place, particularly with the\r\nclothes. If the sound be not heard in the position first assumed, move\r\na little, in different directions, till that point is attained where it\r\nis most distinct. It can scarcely fail to be heard, with ordinary care.\r\nA practised ear will sometimes distinguish the sound as early as the\r\nfourth month, but generally it cannot be heard before the end of the\r\nfifth, or even till the sixth month. There are several sounds that may\r\neither be mistaken for it, or that may confuse the ear. The beating of\r\nthe mother's heart will sometimes be very distinct, as far as the lower\r\npart of the Abdomen, but it is much slower; the child's heart throbbing\r\nnearly twice as fast. The movements of the Fœtus, and the rumbling of\r\nthe intestines, will also interfere; but when once the proper sound has\r\nbeen caught it may be kept independently of all these.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the child lies in the womb will determine where the\r\nheart shall be opposite, and as its position frequently varies, both in\r\ndifferent individuals, and at different periods, in the same person,\r\nthe sound must be sought for at several points, till the right one is\r\nfound. The most usual position will be seen in several of our plates,\r\nand they will give sufficient indication to enable almost any one to\r\npractise this mode of detection with success. During the early months\r\nthe child moves about a good deal, so that the sound may be heard one\r\nday in one place, and the next in another. About the seventh month\r\nhowever, it becomes more fixed, so that the place of the heart can be\r\npretty certainly ascertained, and thus the _position_ of the whole body\r\nis made out, whether the head is downwards or upward, and a tolerable\r\nidea can be formed even as to the direction of each part.\r\n\r\nMany persons have failed in their attempts to hear the Fœtal pulsation,\r\nbut I cannot but think it must have been either from inattention, or\r\nfrom not being acquainted with the sound of the heart at all. I never\r\nrecollect an instance when I could not do so, at the proper time. M.\r\nChailly says he does not hesitate to affirm that in every instance\r\nthey can be detected; and M. P. Dubois distinctly heard them in one\r\nhundred and eighty-five females, out of one hundred and ninety-five,\r\nin the other ten the child being probably dead. Indeed, the absence of\r\nthis sound is the most certain sign of the death of the Fœtus, as its\r\nexistence is of its being alive; and medical men now tell whether the\r\nchild is dead or not by these very means.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the auscultation the female must recline, and keep as\r\nstill as possible, breathing low. The Abdomen may be covered with a\r\nsingle thin garment, if absolutely insisted upon; but the judgment\r\nwill be so much the more uncertain, owing both to the deadening of the\r\nsound and to the friction of the material. The experimenter must also\r\nrecollect that if the head be held down too long, the blood will rush\r\nto it, and cause a humming in the ears, which will confuse him; it will\r\ntherefore be better if the bed be high.\r\n\r\nIt is always best to use the _stethoscope_, as it covers only a small\r\nspace, conveys the sound more directly, and shuts out external noises\r\nmore effectually. This instrument is extremely simple, consisting\r\nmerely of a tube of wood, glass, metal, gum elastic, or almost any\r\nother material. One end should be expanded a little, like a bell, and\r\nthe other made small, so as to fit close in the ear--the large end\r\nbeing placed on the Abdomen. It may be about a foot in length, though\r\na little shorter or longer will not make much difference. I once used\r\na child's _tin trumpet_, having no regular stethoscope with me, and\r\nsucceeded with it perfectly. The large end should be pressed on the\r\nAbdomen, and the smaller one into the ear, sufficiently close to shut\r\nout all other sounds but those coming from the body. This is the same\r\ninstrument that the lungs are sounded with, when we want to judge of\r\ntheir action and condition.\r\n\r\nThis is an invaluable means of detecting pregnancy; in fact, at the\r\nproper time, and with due care, it may be said to be _certain_.\r\n\r\n_End of the sixth month._--This is the period when, according to the\r\nlaw, the child can live. There are no new signs at this time, but those\r\npreviously noticed are now more distinct. The neck of the womb is still\r\nsofter and shorter, and the finger can penetrate further in the passage\r\nthan before. The fundus of the womb is now above the umbilicus, in\r\nprimipara, though not so high in those who have borne children; and the\r\nbladder is above the superior strait.\r\n\r\nBallotment can now be practised with certainty, the falling and rising\r\nof the Fœtus being very distinct.\r\n\r\nAuscultation also becomes more positive, the sounds being louder and\r\nmore easily ascertained.\r\n\r\n_End of the seventh month._--The fundus of the womb has now risen still\r\nhigher, and the Bladder is pushed completely above the upper strait,\r\nso that the whole length of the Urethra lies behind the pubic bone. It\r\nis then much pressed upon and swollen, and being much longer, and bent\r\nout of its usual course, the urine is often passed with difficulty, and\r\nthe catheter can scarcely be introduced. The upper part of the Womb\r\nnow lies over towards the _right side_ of the body, very evidently.\r\nThis direction is nearly constant, in all females, but the reason for\r\nit is not known. There have been many theories to account for the\r\npeculiarity, but none of them are either so plausible, or so well\r\nsupported by facts, as to be generally adopted.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Womb being tilted to the right side, the neck\r\nof course points to the left, and backwards. It is now very short,\r\neven in primipara, but in those who have borne children it is scarcely\r\nto be distinguished at all. The finger may now be introduced, even in\r\nprimipara, half way up the neck; and in others it will reach even into\r\nthe uterine cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nFirst child.\r\n\r\nWoman who has borne children.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the Womb in a first pregnancy, and in a female who has\r\nborne children before, at the end of the seventh month.]\r\n\r\nThe part below the lower line here, shows that part of the neck which\r\nis contained in the Vagina. It will easily be seen how much shorter\r\nthis part is, and how much more open the passage is, in the female who\r\nhas borne children, than in a first pregnancy.\r\n\r\nBallotment and Auscultation both, now afford unmistakeable evidences as\r\nto the condition of the patient.\r\n\r\n_End of the eighth month._--By referring to the preceding Plates, it\r\nwill be seen that the part of the neck of the Womb _above_ the Vagina,\r\nwhich is placed between the two dotted cross lines, remains almost\r\nunchanged, while the part _within_ the Vagina, or that below the lowest\r\nline, becomes less and less, till at this time, in those who have borne\r\nchildren, it can scarcely be felt at all; and even in a primipara it is\r\nmerely like a small tubercle. About this time however, the upper part\r\nof the neck begins to shorten also, though that is not so obvious, and\r\ntherefore not so useful for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nOn making an examination, the mouth of the Womb itself may now be felt,\r\nat the upper part of the Vagina, and far back. It is however, very\r\ndifficult to reach, on account of its position. The finger will now\r\npass, in those who have previously borne children, into the cavity of\r\nthe Womb itself, but in others it will scarcely reach so far.\r\n\r\nThe linea alba becomes darker at this period, and so does the areola\r\naround the nipple. Certain peculiar marks also appear on the Abdomen,\r\nand upper part of the thighs, almost like the _pits_ from small pox.\r\nThey are usually diamond shaped, slightly depressed, and dark in\r\ncolor. They appear to be owing to the over stretching of some of the\r\nparts under the cuticle, and which give way in consequence. In first\r\npregnancies, and in those who enlarge very much, these marks are\r\nsometimes very numerous, and remain for a long time after delivery,\r\nsometimes even they never disappear. As signs of pregnancy however,\r\nthey are but of little value, because they are often produced by other\r\ncauses that distend the Womb. None of these presumptive signs are now\r\nneeded, and therefore they are of little consequence, because there are\r\nothers more certain.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the child itself can now be generally both felt and\r\nseen, and an experienced observer may even predicate from them, with\r\ntolerable certainty, the position in which it lies. Ballotment, by\r\none hand on the Abdomen, may still be practised with success; but in\r\nthe Vagina it is difficult, because the Fœtus is both more fixed and\r\nheavier.\r\n\r\nAuscultation is now the surest dependence however, and may be\r\nadvantageously resorted to also as a means of determining beforehand\r\nthe position of the child. This may be done even a month earlier, but\r\nnot so certainly as now.\r\n\r\nTo understand how this important point is determined, it is only\r\nnecessary to recollect, as will be very evident, that the pulsation\r\nwill be heard the loudest immediately over the heart; and as we know\r\nthe form and general size of the Fœtus, and the manner in which it\r\nusually lies, it becomes possible, when the position of its heart is\r\ndiscovered, to trace out, from that, the position of every other part.\r\nThis will be evident by referring to Plates XIX, XX, and XXI. It will\r\nthen be seen that, if a line be drawn across the middle of the Abdomen,\r\nthe heart will be _above_ that line when the breech presents, and\r\n_below_ it when the head presents, and on the right or left side, as\r\nthe case may be, in each position.\r\n\r\nIn case of twins there will be two pulsations, and they so much\r\ninterfere with each other that it is difficult to distinguish either.\r\nThe two children being generally disposed with the head of one to the\r\nheels of the other, one heart will be _above_ the line, and the other\r\n_below_, on opposite sides, as shown in Plate XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\n  This Plate represents the Fœtus in the most usual position, the head\r\n  downwards, and the back of it presenting to the _left_ side.\r\n\r\n  The black spot _a_, shows the situation of the heart; usually\r\n  immediately under that part where the sound is heard the\r\n  strongest.--It is below the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIX.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the Fœtus in the most usual position, the head\r\ndownwards, and the back of it presenting to the _left_ side.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XX.\r\n\r\n  This Plate represents the Fœtus in the next most frequent position,\r\n  the head downwards, but the back of it presenting to the _right_ side.\r\n\r\n  The black spot _a_, shows the situation of the heart as in the\r\n  previous Plate. It is now below the line, as before, but on the\r\n  opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XX.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the Fœtus in the next most frequent position, the\r\nhead downwards, but the back of it presenting to the _right_ side.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\n  This Plate shows the position of the Fœtus in a presentation of the\r\n  Pelvis, or breech, which happens, comparatively, but seldom.\r\n\r\n  The black spot _a_, denotes the situation of the heart, which is here\r\n  _above_ the line, instead of below.\r\n\r\n  In this case, as in the others, the heart may be on either side of\r\n  the body, according as the child faces, but always above the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXI.\r\n\r\nThis Plate shows the position of the Fœtus in a presentation of the\r\nPelvis, or breech, which happens, comparatively, but seldom.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\n  This represents the position of Twins, as most usually observed, one\r\n  having a head presentation, and the other a breech.\r\n\r\n  The black spot _a_, on both, denotes the position of the heart, which\r\n  in one case is above the line, and in the other below.\r\n\r\n  The head however, may be on the right side instead of the left, and\r\n  so reverse the position of the two hearts, but this is very seldom\r\n  the case.\r\n\r\n  When there are more than two, the confusion and uncertainty becomes\r\n  still greater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXII.\r\n\r\nThis represents the position of Twins, as most usually observed, one\r\nhaving a head presentation, and the other a breech.]\r\n\r\nAt this period the signs previously observed become more distinct, but\r\nthere are few new ones. The external lips sometimes swell, and the\r\nbreathing becomes more difficult, owing to pressure on the diaphragm.\r\nThe trouble with the urine is also apt to increase, and little mucus\r\ntubercles, like pimples, occasionally form around the Os Tincæ, and on\r\nthe upper part of the Vagina.\r\n\r\n_End of the ninth month._--There is but little difference between this\r\nand the previous period. The mouth of the Uterus is more open, and,\r\nin those who have had children, the finger will pass directly into\r\nthe Womb, and feel the child, but in primipara there is still a small\r\nportion of the neck left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the Womb, at near the end of nine months in a primipara.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the Womb, at near the end of nine months, in a woman who\r\nhas previously borne children.]\r\n\r\nBallotment is now more obscure than before, as the Fœtus is very heavy,\r\nand quite low down, and pretty firmly fixed. Auscultation is distinct\r\nenough, but not more so than at the previous period. The swelling of\r\nthe lips, and of the veins of the legs, may increase, and so may the\r\ndifficulty with the urine; but the breathing generally becomes easier,\r\nowing to the Womb having descended a little, and so pressing the\r\ndiaphragm less.\r\n\r\nThese comprise all the signs and indications of pregnancy that possess\r\nany real value. Some of them, at certain times, and under particular\r\ncircumstances, may be called _positive_; such as those discovered by\r\nBallotment and Auscultation, and also the presence of Kyestein in the\r\nurine. Most of the others merely make it _probable_ that pregnancy\r\nexists, or warrant us in presuming as much. They are not to be depended\r\non implicitly alone, but when many of them are observed together, and\r\nno other cause can be assigned for their production, the presumption\r\nbecomes so well supported as almost to be called a moral certainty. A\r\nperson of experience, who is familiar with all these signs, and with\r\nthe others produced by disease which resemble them, will seldom find\r\nit difficult to decide; but still there are cases in which pregnancy\r\nproceeds, even to its termination, with but few unusual symptoms, so\r\nthat both patient and attendant are completely at fault. This however\r\nis very rare, and many eminent authors contend that it is _always_\r\npossible to detect pregnancy, _after the sixth month_, and I think so\r\nmyself, unless the child be dead, in which case it will soon be evident\r\nin another way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDURATION OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duration of pregnancy, or the precise term of Utero Gestation, is\r\nnot fixed. It appears, from accurate observation, that there is no\r\nabsolute period determined by natural laws, and therefore there is\r\nnone laid down by human enactments. An approximation can be made, by\r\ntaking the average of a number of cases, and the period of limitation\r\nmay also be determined in the same way. The most usual period is about\r\nnine months, or from thirty-five to forty weeks, some females going\r\nbeyond the thirty-six weeks, and others not so long. First children\r\nare frequently born under the nine months, and more so than those that\r\ncome after; this is a fact not generally known, and ignorance of it\r\nhas often given rise to unjust suspicions. It is quite possible for\r\na female to be delivered, with the child at full period, in a little\r\nover eight months after marriage, without there being any just grounds\r\nwhatever for suspecting unfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nDr. R. Lee, in his Lectures on the Theory and Practice of Midwifery,\r\ngives the best summary that we have in the language, of our information\r\non this subject; I will therefore quote from his work, making such\r\ncomments and additions as I may think advisable.\r\n\r\n \"The Roman law fixed the period of gestation at ten lunar months. The\r\n civil code of Prussia ordains that a child born 302 days after the\r\n death of the husband shall be considered legitimate. By the law of\r\n France, the legitimacy of a child cannot be called in question who is\r\n born 300 days after the death or departure of the husband. The laws\r\n of England declare that the usual period of human utero-gestation is\r\n nine calendar months, or forty weeks; farther than this they do not\r\n fix a definite period: the law is not exact as to a few days. Nine\r\n calendar months contain only 275 days, and only 273 or 272 if February\r\n be included. To fix bastardy on a child in Scotland, absence must\r\n continue till within six months of the birth, and a child born after\r\n the tenth month is accounted illegitimate.\r\n\r\n \"The difficulty of determining the precise time when impregnation\r\n takes place in the human subject, renders it almost impossible, in any\r\n case, to calculate with absolute certainty the duration of pregnancy.\r\n We are, however, in possession of a sufficient number of observations\r\n to establish the fact that the ordinary period is about forty weeks,\r\n or 280 days; but it is certain that it does occasionally exceed\r\n or fall short of this period by several days. As we can never be\r\n certain of the precise day, between the periods of menstruation, when\r\n conception occurs--whether it takes place immediately after the last\r\n period, or before the expected period, or midway between these--it\r\n is obvious that all calculations founded upon the cessation of the\r\n catamenia must be extremely uncertain. The error of the calculation\r\n will be still greater if the catamenia should have appeared, or a\r\n discharge like the catamenia should have occurred once or twice after\r\n conception. Impregnation most frequently takes place soon after\r\n menstruation, but in others it does not happen till a few days before\r\n the expected period; so that two women may have menstruated at the\r\n same time, and one may have reached the full period three weeks before\r\n the other; and to this extent, or nearly so, an opinion founded on the\r\n disappearance of the catamenia may be erroneous.\r\n\r\n \"Calculations of the duration of pregnancy, founded upon what has been\r\n observed to occur after casual intercourse, or perhaps a single act,\r\n in individuals who can have no motive to tell us what is false, are\r\n likely to be much more correct; and the conclusion to be drawn from\r\n these is, that labor usually, but not invariably, comes on about 280\r\n days after conception, a mature child being sometimes born before\r\n the expiration of forty weeks, and at other times not until the\r\n forty weeks have been exceeded by several days. A case came under my\r\n observation very lately, in which I had no doubt the pregnancy existed\r\n 287 days: the labor did not take place till 287 days had elapsed\r\n from the departure of the husband of this lady for the East Indies.\r\n Some women are always delivered before the end of the forty weeks,\r\n according to the usual calculation, and their children are mature.\r\n\r\n \"In the evidence given on the Gardner Peerage cause, the period\r\n of utero-gestation was limited, but not strictly, by some of the\r\n witnesses, to forty weeks, or 280 days; by others it was extended\r\n to 311 days. Dr. Merriman, whose opinion is always entitled to much\r\n respect, thinks the greatest number of women complete gestation in\r\n the 40th week, and next to that in the 41st. Of 114 pregnancies,\r\n calculated by him from the last day of menstruation, and in which the\r\n children appeared to be mature, 3 deliveries took place at the end of\r\n the 37th week; 13 in the 38th; 14 in the 39th; 33 in the 40th; 22 in\r\n the 41st; 15 in the 42d; 10 in the 43d; and 4 in the 44th week.\r\n\r\n \"How long before the expiration of the 40 weeks a child may be born\r\n with the power of supporting life has not been determined. Where I\r\n have induced premature labor for distortion of the pelvis before the\r\n end of the seventh calendar month from the last menstruation, I have\r\n never seen a child reared. The lady of the clergyman in Fife, whose\r\n case has lately given rise to so much discussion, was delivered 175\r\n days after marriage, and the child lived five months. To what extent\r\n gestation may be protracted in some cases beyond the 280 days it is\r\n very difficult to determine, and the opinions of the most eminent\r\n writers differ upon the subject. I should suspect some great error in\r\n the calculation where the period of gestation exceeded 300 days. But\r\n the experiments made on the lower animals prove that there exists in\r\n them a great variation between the shortest and the longest gestation;\r\n and it is difficult to comprehend why there should be a difference in\r\n this respect in the human species.\"\r\n\r\nIn a trial which took place in this country, in the county of\r\nLancaster, Pa., as reported in the _Medical Examiner_ for June, 1846,\r\nit was decided that Gestation may be prolonged to _three hundred and\r\nthirteen days_! The female swore that conception must have taken place\r\non the twenty-third of March, 1845, and the child was not born till the\r\nthirtieth of January, 1846, or over _eleven months_. The judge directed\r\nthe jury to return a verdict in her favor, and I suppose this case\r\nestablishes a precedent for America.\r\n\r\nIn a recent number of the _Medical Gazette_, I find a case reported\r\nwherein the period was said to be prolonged still farther. A man left\r\nhis wife in New South Wales, he coming to England, and _twelve months_\r\nafter he left she was delivered of a child, which she claimed to be\r\nlegitimate. He denied this however, and the judge in the Consistory\r\nCourt decided, without hesitation, in his favor. Taking the medium\r\nbetween these two cases therefore, it appears to be decided that the\r\n_extreme limits_ is somewhere between _eleven_ and _twelve_ months! It\r\nmust be recollected however, that both were perfectly arbitrary, and\r\nthat, for anything known positively on the subject, both may be either\r\nright or wrong.\r\n\r\nExcept when labor is brought on prematurely by violence, it always\r\ncommences at what would have been one of the monthly periods; or in\r\nother words, after a certain number of _full months_, and never at any\r\ntime between! If therefore a female passes over the _ninth_ month, she\r\nwill probably go to the _tenth_. This has been proved by extensive\r\nobservation, and is only another proof of the regular method in which\r\nnature conducts all her operations. The same law is also observed in\r\nabortions, which generally take place at one of the months, unless\r\nbrought on suddenly by violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPERIOD WHEN THE CHILD CAN LIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe precise period when the child can live, if brought into the world,\r\nis not determined, any more than the time it may remain in the Womb.\r\nSome children may be able to live a considerable time before the full\r\nperiod of Gestation, and others may not till some time after, there\r\nbeing a great difference in regard to their development.\r\n\r\nOne may be as fully developed at six, as another at seven months. The\r\ncommon opinion is that the child cannot live if born before _seven\r\nmonths_. This, however, is incorrect. Many instances have been known\r\nof births at six months, and even earlier, in which the child lived,\r\nand became strong and healthy. Van Swieten mentions the case of one\r\nFortunio Liceti, who was born before the sixth month. He was not\r\nlarger than the hand, but grew to the average size, and lived to be\r\nseventy-one years old. Dr. Gunning Bedford mentions a similar case, in\r\nhis translation of Chailly's Midwifery. There are even cases mentioned\r\nof children living at five months, but it must be borne in mind that\r\nit is seldom possible to determine the exact period. As a general rule\r\nhowever, the child does not live till after the seventh month, though\r\nthere undoubtedly have been cases where it has lived before the end\r\nof the sixth month. The law adopts the medium period, and declares\r\nthe child capable of living at _the end of the sixth month_, and not\r\nbefore. There is no reason whatever for supposing that it is less\r\nlikely to live at eight months than at seven, or that it will not live\r\nat all at eight months, as some do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nTHE FORM, SIZE, AND POSITION OF THE FŒTUS, AND ITS APPENDAGES, AT FULL\r\nTERM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFORM AND SIZE OF THE FŒTUS AT FULL TERM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE AND FORM OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nThe average length of the Fœtus, at full term, is about twelve inches\r\nfrom the head to the breech, and about eighteen inches from the head\r\nto the feet. Its weight varies from five to eight pounds, perhaps\r\naveraging about six, though some have been born weighing only three\r\npounds, or less, and some even as high as twelve. The breadth across\r\nthe shoulders is about four inches, and the same across the hips, but\r\nboth are so easily compressed that during delivery they only measure\r\nabout three inches, or three and a half at most.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE AND FORM OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nThe head is the most important part, because it is the largest, and\r\nusually present first. It is therefore necessary to describe it fully,\r\nand with special reference to its importance, in the early stages of\r\nlabor, as the part by which the position is usually determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\n  The head is generally divided into the Cranium, or that part which\r\n  contains the brain, and the Face.\r\n\r\n  _The Bones of the Cranium._--These are seven in number, viz., two\r\n  _Frontal_ Bones, or those forming the forehead; 1, 1, Figs. 1 and 2,\r\n  (Plate XXIV.)--Two _Parietal_ bones, or those forming the sides of\r\n  the head; 2, 2, Figs. 1 and 2.--The _Occipital_ bone, or that forming\r\n  the back of the head; 3, 3, Figs. 1 and 2.--And two _Temporal_ bones,\r\n  which lie over and between the ear and the eye; 4, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  _The Bones of the Face._--These are five in number, viz., two\r\n  _Superior Maxillary_, or upper jaw bones; 5, Fig. 2.--Two _Malar_, or\r\n  cheek bones; 6, Fig. 2.--And one _Inferior Maxillary_, or lower jaw\r\n  bone; 7, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FŒTAL HEAD.\r\n\r\nPlate XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe head is generally divided into the Cranium, or that part which\r\ncontains the brain, and the Face.]\r\n\r\nThe bones of the cranium are not closed together, as they are in the\r\nadult, but are separated to a considerable distance, in certain parts,\r\nand connected by a strong membrane. These membranous spaces are called\r\n_Sutures_ and _Fontanelles_, and a knowledge of them is absolutely\r\nnecessary, as a means of ascertaining the position of the head.\r\n\r\n_The Sutures._--The first of these spaces, which extends from the\r\nlowest part of the middle of the forehead to the occipital bone, is\r\ncalled the _Sagittal Suture_, or antero posterior Suture: A, B, C,\r\nFigs. 1 and 2. It separates the two frontal, and the two parietal\r\nbones. The spaces between the two frontal and the two parietal bones\r\nare called the _Frontal Parietal Sutures_, _o. o._ Fig. 1; and those\r\nbetween the two parietal bones and the occipital, _l. l._ Figs. 1 and\r\n2, are called the _Lambdoidal Sutures_.\r\n\r\n_The Fontanelles._--When the different Sutures meet at a point,\r\nthe membranous space is greater than at other parts, and is called\r\na Fontanelle. Thus when the two Frontal Parietal Sutures meet the\r\nSagittal Suture, at B, Figs. 1 and 2, there is quite a large diamond\r\nshaped space between the different bones, filled up with membrane. This\r\nis called the _Anterior Fontanelle_, or bregma. Where the Sagittal\r\nSuture joins the two Lambdoidal there is another space, not so large,\r\nand different in shape, being triangular; this is called the _Posterior\r\nFontanelle_, _c._ Figs. 1 and 2. And where each of the temporal bones\r\njoins the parietal there are two other spaces, called the _Temporal\r\nFontanelles_, _t._ Fig. 2, which are also irregularly diamond shaped,\r\nbut not nearly so large as the anterior fontanelle.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if a person can distinguish these Fontanelles, when\r\nhe touches them with his finger, he can tell what part of the head is\r\npresenting, and hence their use.\r\n\r\nThese spaces allow of the bones lapping over each other, during\r\ndelivery, and thus the head is made smaller. They do not disappear\r\ntill sometime after birth, and in very young children the brain may be\r\nfelt, and seen to work, at the anterior fontanelle. Eventually however,\r\nthe bones come close together, and are joined by a curious kind of\r\ndovetailing. The two frontal bones however, completely coalesce, and\r\nform but one, in the adult.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bones will be very perfectly formed, and the fontanelles\r\nnearly filled up, before birth, and then the head cannot be crushed\r\nmuch smaller, and so the labor becomes both painful and difficult. This\r\nis usually called an ossified, or solid head.\r\n\r\n_Diameters of the Head._--The diameters of the head are the distances\r\nbetween its most prominent points. They are necessary to be known\r\nbefore we can judge as to the possibility of its passing the straits of\r\nthe Pelvis, in the various positions.\r\n\r\nGenerally there are reckoned _ten_ diameters, and they are represented\r\nin the following Plate:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.\r\n\r\n_Diameters of the Head._\r\n\r\n1. The _Occipito Mental_, or from the back of the head to the chin, M,\r\nO, Fig. 1, five inches.\r\n\r\n2. The _Mento Bregmatic_, or from the chin to the anterior fontanelle\r\nat the top of the head, M, O, Fig. 1, four inches.\r\n\r\n3. The _Occipito Frontal_, or from the back of the head to the top of\r\nthe forehead, O, F, Fig. 1, four inches.\r\n\r\n4. The _Trachelo Occipital_, or from the throat to the back of the\r\nhead, T, O, Fig. 1, four inches.\r\n\r\n5. The _Sub Occipito Bregmatic_, or from the nape of the neck to the\r\ntop of the head, S, B, Fig. 1, three inches and a half.\r\n\r\n6. The _Trachelo Bregmatic_, or from the top of the throat to the top\r\nof the head, T, B, Fig. 1, about three inches and a half.\r\n\r\n7. The _Trachelo Frontal_, or from the top of the throat to the top of\r\nthe forehead, T, F, Fig. 1, about three inches.\r\n\r\n8. The _Sub Occipito Frontal_, or from the nape of the neck to the top\r\nof the forehead, S, F, Fig. 1, about three inches.\r\n\r\n9. The _Bi Parietal_, or across the head from one side to the other at\r\nthe middle of the parietal bones, the widest part, B, P, Fig. 2, three\r\ninches and a quarter to three and a half.\r\n\r\n10. The _Bi Temporal_, or across the head from one temporal bone to the\r\nother, B, T, Fig. 2, about two inches and a half.]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for knowing these diameters will be obvious. It is only\r\nby being acquainted with them, and with the straits of the Pelvis,\r\nalready described, that we can tell whether the child can pass or\r\nnot in certain positions, and how we must change its position, when\r\npossible, to give relief.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the diameters of the head with those of the Pelvis, it\r\nwill be seen that some of them correspond in size while others do\r\nnot, so that in one position delivery can take place spontaneously,\r\nwhile in another it will be difficult, and in some nearly impossible,\r\nwithout assistance. Thus, for instance, if the head should present by\r\nthe occipito mental diameter, (O, M, Fig. 1,) it evidently could not\r\npass while in that position, because by this diameter it is five inches\r\nin width, and the greatest diameter of the Pelvis is only about four\r\ninches and a half. Its position must therefore be changed, and the\r\naccoucheur must know how to change it with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE FŒTUS AT FULL TERM.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Fœtus is represented in the following Plate:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\n_Attitude of the Fœtus._\r\n\r\nThe arms, it will be seen, are crossed on the breast, upon which the\r\nchin is also bent; the thighs are close together, and brought against\r\nthe Abdomen; the legs are close bent on the Thighs, and the feet are\r\nturned up against the front of the legs, the whole body being curved\r\nforward.]\r\n\r\nThe position in which the Fœtus most usually lies in the Womb has\r\nalready been shown, particularly in Plate XII, and in Plate XVI. The\r\nhead is downwards, and the back part of it turned to the mother's\r\nleft side. What is the cause of this almost universal position is\r\nnot certainly known. It was formerly thought to depend on the head\r\nbeing heavier than the other parts, and thus sinking down; but this\r\nsupposition has been shown to be entirely without foundation. M. P.\r\nDubois has lately advanced the notion that it depends on an instinctive\r\nfeeling in the Fœtus itself, which directs it to take that position\r\nby which it can most easily make its exit. This opinion appears very\r\nreasonable, and is apparently well founded. It is well known that the\r\nFœtus is susceptible of various impressions while in the Womb, and\r\nimpelled by unerring instinct to take the breast immediately it is\r\nborn; nay, it has even been known to suck the finger of the assistant,\r\nin cases of face presentation, even before birth! We can readily\r\nbelieve, therefore, that it is directed to place itself in the Womb, in\r\nthe best position, the same as it is directed to take the finger in its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nIn the young of many of the lower animals this is also strikingly\r\nexemplified. The young duck in the shell taps with its little beak\r\nagainst the part that is to be broken, and rushes into the water even\r\nwith a part of the shell still on its back. The young oppossums, who\r\nare born imperfect from the Womb, shelter themselves, immediately they\r\ncome into the world, in the pouch on the mother's breast, and fasten\r\nthemselves to the mammæ till they are more perfectly grown.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked however, that the head does not _always_ present\r\nfirst, though it usually does so. Occasionally we have the breech\r\npresent, and still rarer even other parts; but these are merely\r\nexceptional deviations, the causes of which are unknown. Out of every\r\nsixteen children born, _fifteen_ usually come head first. This however,\r\nwill be shown better further on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE APPENDAGES OF THE FŒTUS AT TERM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMBRANES.\r\n\r\nThe uses and arrangements of the membranes surrounding the Fœtus have\r\nalready been explained, so that little more is needed to be said here,\r\nbecause they are not much different at the full term from what they are\r\nat an earlier period, excepting perhaps that the _amnion_ is a little\r\nmore dense and firm. This membrane appears not only to surround the\r\nFœtus like a bag, to contain the waters, but is also reflected close on\r\nto its body, like its skin, with which in fact it is thought by some to\r\nbe connected. The child is certainly born with this membrane still on\r\nits body, and does not part with it till some days after birth, when it\r\npeels off like a thin dead skin, or powder.\r\n\r\nThe _waters_, enclosed within the Amnion, (see Plate XII,) have now\r\nincreased to their greatest quantity; and there is also, in most cases,\r\na second body of fluid between the Amnion and the Chorion, which coming\r\naway before the real discharge, is called the _false waters_.--(See\r\nPlate XII.)\r\n\r\nThe quantity of the true waters, at birth, is about twenty, or from\r\nthat to thirty ounces, but is very variable. It is of a greenish color,\r\nrather muddy, and heavier than water. It contains albumen, (white of\r\negg,) sulphate of soda, and lime. Ninety-eight per cent. of it however,\r\nis pure water. It appears to be excreted, like perspiration, from the\r\nsurface of the membranes, and most likely is merely the watery portion\r\nof the blood exuded through. The uses of this fluid are various. As\r\nalready stated, it probably supplies some nutriment to the fœtus,\r\nwhich it also protects, in a great measure, from pressure and from\r\nconcussions. It also prevents the limbs from adhering, and helps to\r\ndistend the mouth of the Womb, in the earlier stages of labor, besides\r\naffording an abundant slippery fluid for the purpose of lubricating the\r\npassages, thus making the passage of the child more easy.--(See Plate\r\nXII.)\r\n\r\nThe other two membranes, the Chorion and Decidua, are not of much\r\nimportance in our present explanation; and practically, in fact, the\r\nwhole three may be regarded as _one envelope_, surrounding the child\r\nand the waters in which it floats.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACENTA.\r\n\r\nAt the full term the Placenta, (See Plate XII,) is about six or seven\r\ninches in diameter, and nearly circular, though often irregular. Its\r\nthickness varies from one to two inches, and is greatest where the cord\r\nis inserted. Sometimes it is very large, or very thick, and may then be\r\ndifficult to extract, and even cause serious accidents.\r\n\r\nAs already explained the Placenta is composed of a mass of\r\nblood-vessels, by means of which the blood of the fœtus is, in some\r\nway, brought into contact, or commingled with that of the mother. Its\r\nuterine face is irregular, being broken into lobes, or cotyledons,\r\non which may be seen a vast number of little veins and arteries,\r\ncorresponding with others on the inner surface of the Womb. Its outer\r\nsurface is of a grey red color, and covered with the fœtal membranes,\r\nunder which the large blood-vessels can be traced. The Placenta is\r\nusually attached to one side of the Uterus, near the fundus, or at the\r\nfundus, but sometimes it grows wholly, or in part, over the mouth of\r\nthe Womb; an occurrence which may cause serious consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen there is more than one child each usually has a separate placenta,\r\nand they are all intimately connected. In some rare cases however, one\r\nplacenta only exists with twins. Each child has also a separate amnion,\r\nand waters; but there may be only one chorion and decidua for the\r\nwhole, or each may have a complete set of membranes itself. Instances\r\nhave been known however, of two children being enclosed in the same\r\namnion, and surrounded by the same waters, having but one placenta\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThese possible diversities show the accoucheur how necessary it is\r\nfor him, in any case of multiple pregnancy, to be sure that he has\r\nabstracted _all_ the after birth; and they also caution him not to\r\nproceed to unnecessary manipulations merely because it is not the same\r\nas in other cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UMBILICAL CORD.\r\n\r\nThis is composed, as already stated, of an artery and two veins, which\r\ntwist round the artery, like the strands of a rope. These are all\r\nenclosed in a sheath, and surrounded by a thick kind of mucus, called\r\nthe _Gelatine of Wharton_. Its thickness is about that of the little\r\nfinger, though it may be much larger, having been seen as thick as the\r\nchild's body. Its usual length is about eighteen or twenty inches, but\r\nit has measured as much as five feet. Then again it has been found\r\nso small that the vessels in it could not nourish the child. These\r\nexceptional variations however, are very rare. The veins may also be\r\nenlarged, or full of knots, and the circulation may be so much impeded\r\nthereby as to cause abortion. The various accidents which may result\r\nfrom anomalies in the cord will however, engage our attention in\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN ALL THE DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS AND\r\nPOSITIONS OF THE FŒTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPRESENTATIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE FŒTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child may present several different parts of its body, at the\r\ncommencement of delivery, and they may be in different positions\r\nrelatively to the different parts of the Pelvis. All these require to\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\nDifferent authors have made different classifications of the\r\npresentations and positions, and have differently named them; but this\r\nis of little consequence, since they are still the same, no matter how\r\nthey are named. I shall follow the arrangement of M. Chailly, because I\r\nthink it equally perfect, and much more simple and practical, than any\r\nother yet proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe fœtus may present at the mouth of the Womb either by the _head_,\r\nthe most usual way--by the lower extremities, which is the most\r\nfrequent way after the head--or by various parts of the trunk, which is\r\nthe least frequent way of all.\r\n\r\nIn each of these _three_ full presentations there may be certain\r\nvariations, which require to be noticed. The head, for instance, may\r\npresent either by the _cranium_ or by the _face_; the lower part of the\r\nbody may present either by the _feet_, the _knees_, or the _breech_,\r\naccording as the legs and thighs are flexed or extended; and the trunk\r\nmay present either on the _right_ or _left_ side, and inclined towards\r\nthe _back_ or towards the _chest_, though neither the back nor abdomen\r\never fully present.\r\n\r\nEach of these variations may also have slight variations again. Thus\r\nthe face may present full, or by one or the other cheek, and so on.\r\nThese variations however, are of little practical consequence, because\r\nwe only find them at the very commencement of the labor, and they\r\nalways change to the full presentation.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking therefore, there are _five full presentations_,\r\nviz., _the Cranium_, _the Face_, _the Breech_, _the Feet_, or knees,\r\nand the _Trunk_, either by the right or left side.\r\n\r\nThe _varieties_ of these, as already remarked, not requiring any\r\nspecial attention from the accoucheur, providing he is not puzzled or\r\nmisled by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\nThe position means the particular direction in which the presenting\r\npart of the Fœtus is placed in relation to the Pelvic straits. The\r\nPelvis itself is supposed to be divided into two similar halves, the\r\n_right_ and the _left_, and each presenting part has one particular\r\nplace which is referred to as the indicating point. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in the Cranium the Occipit, or behind part of the head, is\r\nthe indicating point; and we therefore say, in Cranium presentations,\r\nthat it is a _right or left Occipital position_, according as the\r\nback of the head is to the right or left side of the Pelvis. In face\r\npresentations, the chin (_mentor_) is the indicating point, and we\r\ntherefore say it is a _right or left mento position_, according as the\r\nchin is towards the right or left side. In breech presentations, the\r\nchild's sacrum is the indicating point, and we then say it is a _right\r\nor left sacral position_, according as the Sacrum is towards the right\r\nor left side of the Pelvis. In trunk presentations, which are always\r\ncrosswise, the head (cephalo) is the indicating point, and we therefore\r\nsay it is a _right or left cephalo position_, according as the head\r\nlies towards the right or left side of the mother's body.\r\n\r\nIn Cranium presentations also, the back of the head is not merely on\r\nthe right or left side, but may be at two different points on each\r\nside. It may be either nearest to the Sacrum (posterior), or nearest\r\nto the pubes (anterior), but still against the Ilium; it is therefore\r\ncalled a _right or left anterior_, _or posterior_, _occipito iliac\r\nposition_, as the case may be. Sometimes also, the occiput lodges\r\nimmediately on the pubis, instead of going to either side, and that is\r\ncalled an _occipito pubic position_; at other times, on the contrary,\r\nit is placed against the Sacrum, instead of being on either side, and\r\nthat is called an _occipito sacral position_.\r\n\r\nIn presentations of the head therefore, we may reckon _six_\r\npositions--the right and left anterior and posterior occipito iliac,\r\nand the pubic and sacral.\r\n\r\nIn presentations of the face the same; they being _mento_ iliac and so\r\non, instead of occipito.\r\n\r\nIn presentations of the lower extremities also the same, excepting that\r\nthey are _sacro_ iliac and so on, instead of occipito.\r\n\r\nIn presentations of the trunk we have but two positions for each side,\r\nthe right and left cephalo iliac; according as the head is on the\r\nright or left side of the mother's body. The child always lying, in\r\npresentations of the trunk, crosswise--the feet on one side and the\r\nhead on the other.\r\n\r\nMost authors enumerate many more presentations and positions, but they\r\nare of little practical utility. When the head presents, for instance,\r\nthe delivery takes place in nearly the same manner, let it be in what\r\nposition it may. And in presentations of the face, or of the lower\r\nextremities, the particular position is of little consequence, the\r\ndelivery being usually effected much the same in them all. Some of\r\nthe positions are, it is true, much more favorable than others, but a\r\nspontaneous delivery, generally speaking, occurs in all of them, when\r\nthe head, face, or lower extremities presents. Very frequently indeed,\r\nthe less favorable positions are changed to the more favorable ones,\r\nand the worst seldom do more than impede delivery for a time, unless\r\nthere be some malformation, or loss of power. I therefore refer to them\r\nmore for convenience in future explanations, and to enable my readers\r\nto know what is meant by them, when they read other books; not because\r\nthey are really necessary to be understood, or of any great practical\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Baudelocque admitted _seventy-four positions_, and\r\n_twenty-two presentations_; and the number might be made still greater,\r\nif all the variations were to be enumerated. Such classifications\r\nhowever, are more ingenious than useful, and they are but little\r\nnoticed even by medical men.\r\n\r\nI shall merely describe the mechanism of labor in the most frequent\r\npositions, in each presentation, because the others usually change\r\ninto these; and even when they do not, the process of delivery is\r\nessentially the same, and also the mode of assisting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF ASCERTAINING THE PRESENTATION AND POSITION.\r\n\r\n_The Presentation._--Although in general it is not possible to\r\nascertain with certainty, what part of the fœtus presents to the\r\nmouth of the Womb, until labor commences, yet a tolerable judgment\r\ncan frequently be formed before. In head presentations, on performing\r\nballotment, the head is felt, like a firm round tumor, occupying all\r\nthe space which the finger can reach, very differently from any other\r\npart. The peculiar cramps in the female's lower limbs, and frequent\r\ninclination to urinate, mentioned in the signs of labor, are also\r\nstrong indications of this presentation, being seldom experienced in\r\nany other. When the labor has actually commenced there can be but\r\nlittle uncertainty in these cases, for, immediately the mouth of the\r\nWomb is sufficiently open, the finger can be introduced, and the head\r\nfelt like a smooth, round, and elastic bony tumor, not likely to be\r\nmistaken for anything else, if ordinary care be taken. After the waters\r\nhave escaped, it can of course be felt still more distinctly. If even\r\nan inexperienced person bears in mind the _shape_ of the head, and\r\nreflects how it must _fill up_ the passage, and how it must feel, from\r\nbeing composed of separated thin bony plates, lying on a soft yielding\r\nsubstance like the brain, he can scarcely fail to recognize it. The\r\nsensation is very much like that of pressing a piece of firm card board\r\non an inflated bladder, which forms a tolerable representative of the\r\nfœtal head. Sometimes there is a difficulty from a great quantity\r\nof water being intruded between the membranes and the head, which\r\nsomewhat obscures the touch, but this only necessitates greater care.\r\nThe water however, may be in such quantity as to entirely prevent the\r\ntouch, in which case nothing can be done till the membranes break; the\r\npresentation can then be ascertained with certainty, and it will be\r\nquite early enough to render assistance, if it should be an unfavorable\r\none. I have known some inexperienced persons mistake the bag of water\r\nitself for the head, and commit great errors in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe Face can seldom be mistaken, because the nose, or mouth, may be\r\nfelt; and, by passing the finger up the side of the head, the ears also.\r\n\r\nThe trunk is in general easy of recognition. Nearly always the right\r\nor left shoulder occupies the passage, or is near to it, so that the\r\nfinger may be readily passed under the arm pit. The shoulder joints,\r\nthe ribs, or the shoulder blade bone, all feel very different to the\r\nhead, and are not likely to be taken for it.\r\n\r\nIn presentations of the lower extremities there is still less danger of\r\nerror. If the feet, or knees, occupy the passage, they can scarcely be\r\nmistaken. The breech is certainly something like the head in its form,\r\nbut feels different, and is divided down the middle by the indentation\r\nbetween the two cheeks, along which the finger can be passed till it\r\nenters between the limbs.\r\n\r\nIn irregular presentations, as of the arms for instance, or of one\r\nleg, or an arm and leg, it is only necessary to carefully feel them,\r\nso as to ascertain their form, and the relation of their parts. Thus\r\nthe fingers can be distinguished from the toes, and the feet from the\r\nhands, particularly if the ankle can be felt.\r\n\r\nThe accoucheur should ascertain the particular presentation _as early\r\nas possible_, because he may sometimes be of service in correcting\r\nan unfavorable one, if he is certain of it in time, and knows what he\r\nis about. He should not however, use any degree of force to ascertain\r\nit, in case he cannot do so without, but wait till the conditions are\r\nmore favorable. Neither should he, with the same object, rupture the\r\nmembranes too soon, for he may thereby cause considerable delay and\r\ndifficulty, without any good to counterbalance it.\r\n\r\nAll the above-named presentations may, and usually do, terminate\r\nspontaneously, except those of the trunk, and even they do\r\noccasionally, though more frequently they require assistance.\r\n\r\n_Relative frequency of the different presentations._--The most\r\nfavorable presentations, and positions also, are always the most\r\nfrequent, while the unfavorable ones are but seldom met with.\r\nAccording to Madame Lachapelle, in _fifteen thousand six hundred and\r\nfifty-two labors_ there are about _fourteen thousand seven hundred\r\nand forty-nine_ presentations of the head and face; about _five\r\nhundred and eighty-six_ of the breech, knees, and feet; and only about\r\n_sixty-eight_ of the trunk, or shoulders.\r\n\r\n_Positions._--The position is generally of but little consequence,\r\nbecause in all the favorable presentations spontaneous delivery occurs\r\nin every position alike, and in the unfavorable presentations the same\r\nassistance is required in one position as in another. In some cases an\r\nunfavorable position of the head may be changed however, to a better\r\none; and therefore, so far as the head is concerned, the positions are\r\nworth ascertaining.\r\n\r\nThe mode of determining the position is by feeling for the _sutures_\r\nand _fontanelles_, described in Chapter VIII; and this cannot be\r\nusually done till after the membranes are broken, when the head can be\r\ndistinctly touched. By referring to Plate XXIV, the shape and position\r\nof the Fontanelles will be seen, and if the head be supposed placed\r\nwith the top downwards, and the back of it to the mother's left side,\r\nthey may be readily found with the finger.\r\n\r\nIn the left anterior occipito iliac position, or that when the back\r\nof the child's head is against the left side of the mother's pelvis,\r\nand nearest the pubes, while its forehead is against the right side,\r\nand nearest the sacrum,--the sagittal suture, or opening along the\r\ntop, will of course run across from right to left. This opening may\r\nbe distinctly felt with the finger, which should be passed along\r\nit towards the right side, and it will then reach the _anterior\r\nfontanelle_; afterwards it should also be passed to the left side, and\r\nthen it will reach the _posterior fontanelle_. The difference between\r\nthese two openings, in shape and size, is shown in Plate XXIV, and even\r\nif a person has never seen, or felt, the head of a newborn child, they\r\ncan scarcely be taken for each other, after noticing that Plate.\r\n\r\nIf the anterior fontanelle should be felt on the left side instead\r\nof the right, and near the pubes, while the posterior fontanelles is\r\nto the right, and near the sacrum, the position must be the _right\r\nposterior occipito iliac_, or just the reverse of the former.\r\n\r\nIf the sagittal suture should be found to run across from the pubes\r\nto the sacrum, instead of from one side to the other, it will then\r\nindicate either an occipito pubic, or occipito sacral position,\r\naccording as the back of the head is behind or before; and this can be\r\nreadily ascertained by finding either of the fontanelles.\r\n\r\nIn short, if the relative position, forms, and directions of these\r\nopenings in the child's head be clearly understood, the position of\r\nthe head can nearly always be determined by feeling them, as will be\r\nevident by referring to our former explanation of them.\r\n\r\nSometimes however, the bones overlap a good deal, from the head being\r\npressed, and then instead of an opening along the top, a _seam_ will be\r\nfelt. And sometimes, from long continued pressure, a quantity of blood,\r\nand watery fluid, will be effused under the scalp, so as to prevent\r\nthe bone being distinctly touched. But these accidents seldom happen,\r\nand with ordinary care and perseverance, need not prevent the position\r\nbeing determined, after a little delay.\r\n\r\nThe position of other presenting parts is easily ascertained, by\r\nfeeling for some known point--as the _nose_, or the face, the\r\ndepression between the cheeks, or the breech, and so on.\r\n\r\n_Relative frequency of the different positions._--The most favorable\r\npositions, like the most favorable presentations, are also the most\r\nfrequent. According to Baudelocque, in _ten thousand three hundred and\r\ntwenty-two cases_, of head presentation, there were _eight thousand\r\nfive hundred and twenty-two_ cases when the back of the child's head\r\nwas on the mother's left side, and towards the front, (or in the left\r\nanterior occipito iliac position); _one thousand seven hundred and\r\nfifty-four_ when it was on the _right_ side towards the front, (right\r\nanterior occipito iliac); _twenty-five times_ to the right side, but\r\ntowards the Sacrum, (right posterior occipito iliac); and _nineteen\r\ntimes_ on the left, but towards the Sacrum, (left posterior occipito\r\niliac.) Being most frequently with the back of the head _towards the\r\nfront on the left side_, as shown in Plate XXVII; next towards the\r\nfront on the right side; and but seldom towards the Sacrum, or back,\r\non either side. In all these ten thousand cases we do not find a\r\nsingle instance of the head lying from back to front, in the _occipito\r\npubic_, or _occipito sacral_ positions, commonly called transverse;\r\nneither do we find a single instance in _fifteen thousand six hundred\r\nand fifty-two cases_ recorded by Madame Lachapelle; which will show\r\nhow rare such unfortunate positions must be. What this great frequency\r\nof one particular position depends upon we do not know--possibly on\r\nthat cause, previously alluded to, which determines the most frequent\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nIn the next Chapter, the mechanism of delivery, or the manner in which\r\nthe child escapes out of the body, as it most frequently occurs, will\r\nbe fully explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANISM OF DELIVERY, IN A PRESENTATION OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEFT ANTERIOR OCCIPITO ILIAC POSITION.\r\n\r\nThis is the presentation and position most frequently observed, perhaps\r\nfifteen out of sixteen times. In most Obstetrical works it is called\r\nthe _first_ position.\r\n\r\nBy observing the following Plates, and referring to the previous\r\nexplanations of the diameters of the Pelvis, and fœtal head, in Plates\r\nIX and XXV, it will be seen that through all its changes of position,\r\nwhile making its exit, the head always presents by one of its shortest\r\ndiameters to one of the largest diameters of the Pelvis, so that the\r\nrelation between them is invariably the best that could be established;\r\nand many peculiar turnings and revolutions occur, apparently for the\r\nexpress purpose of bringing this about.\r\n\r\nBefore the rupture of the membranes the head presents its occipito\r\nfrontal diameter, which measures four inches, to the right oblique\r\ndiameter of the Pelvis, which measures four inches and a half; while\r\nits bi-parietal diameter, which measures only about three inches and\r\na half, is presented to the other oblique diameter, also measuring\r\nfour and a half--(See Plate XIX.) Even here it will be seen that the\r\npassage is larger than the head which has to pass through it, but a\r\nmore favorable position still can be obtained, by a slight movement of\r\nthe Fœtus, which nature accordingly accomplishes, and also follows by\r\nothers, to preserve the advantage, which will next be described.\r\n\r\n_Movements of the Fœtal Head._--There are three of these peculiar\r\nmovements, each of which takes place at a particular period of the\r\nlabor, and must be described separately.\r\n\r\n_First movement, flexion, and descent._--Immediately after the\r\nMembranes are broken, the contractions of the Uterus force the head\r\ninto the upper strait, by the occipito frontal diameter of four inches,\r\nas already shown; but then commences the first movement, which consists\r\nin a bending of the child's chin down upon its breast, so that the\r\nforehead is carried up into the Womb; and the most prominent point of\r\nthe back of the head presents to the middle of the passage, by the\r\n_occipito bregmatic_ diameter, which is only about _three inches_\r\ninstead of four. This of course makes the passage so much easier, and\r\ngenerally, immediately after this change, the head descends into the\r\nbasin of the Pelvis.\r\n\r\nIt is not absolutely necessary however, for this movement to occur, for\r\nin a well formed Pelvis the head can descend without it, though not so\r\neasily; and sometimes, in fact, it does not take place, but this is\r\nunusual.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that this shifting of the head alters the\r\nposition of the _fontanelles_--the posterior one being brought more\r\nto the centre of the strait, and the anterior one carried up out of\r\nreach, while previous to the movement they were both on a level. If an\r\nexamination is not made therefore, till after this change, it may be\r\ndifficult to determine the position, unless this is borne in mind. The\r\nfollowing Plates show this very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\n  It will be seen here that the neck is straightened out, and that the\r\n  two fontanelles are on a line with each other.\r\n\r\n  _Note._--The front of the bones are represented in this and the two\r\n  following Plates, as if transparent, so that the head may be seen\r\n  through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVII.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the head just entering the upper Strait.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  At this time the anterior fontanelle can scarcely be reached, but the\r\n  posterior one is easily to be reached, being in the open passage, on\r\n  the left side. The head is now fairly within the Pelvic cavity, but\r\n  still lies across from right to left.\r\n\r\n  _Second Movement, Rotation of the Head._--When the Fœtus is thus\r\n  brought to the bottom of the Pelvis, its head turns completely round,\r\n  the back of it being brought to the front, or under the pubes of the\r\n  mother, and its forehead turned against her Sacrum, as represented in\r\n  Plate XXIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the head descended still lower in the Pelvis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXIX.\r\n\r\n  Here the head is seen just beginning to turn--the right side, and\r\n  part of the back of it, just passing under the pubes. As the rotation\r\n  becomes complete the neck straightens, so that the two fontanelles\r\n  are again found on the same level. Finally the back of the head fully\r\n  emerges from under the pubic arch, and the chin slides gradually out\r\n  after it beneath, so that the neck of the child is encircled by the\r\n  ring of the Vulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIX.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the head still further down, and beginning to\r\nRotate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX.\r\n\r\nIn _Fig. 1_, the back of the head is nearly under the pubic bone, while\r\nthe forehead is just passing the external opening below.\r\n\r\nIn _Fig. 2_, the back of the head is completely extruded, and also the\r\nchin, so that the whole head is now born.--(_p._ is the pubic bone, in\r\nfront.)]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1 it will be seen how the Os Coccygis, or lowest part of the\r\nback bone, (c,) is straitened out, backward, while the head is passing,\r\nas I explained before; and in Fig. 2 it has returned again to its\r\nnatural position.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this rotation of the head will be obvious on calling\r\nto mind the form of the Pelvis and the external opening. On examining\r\nPlates IX and X, it will be seen that the longest diameter of the\r\nVulva, or external opening, the _antero posterior_, is nearly at right\r\nangles to the longest diameters of the upper strait, the _oblique_.\r\nNow the longest diameter of the head is adapted to this oblique\r\ndiameter, on _entering_ the upper strait, as already explained, and it\r\nis necessary for it also to be adapted to the longest diameter of the\r\nexternal opening, the anterior posterior when making its _exit_; but\r\nas the two are not parallel the head is compelled to turn, or rotate,\r\nin order to pass from one to the other. To accomplish this however,\r\nthe neck has to be twisted considerably. But when the head is fully\r\ndelivered, it is immediately straitened again, by the back of the head\r\nturning towards the mother's left side, so that its proper relations\r\nwith the trunk is re-established.\r\n\r\n_Third Movement, Rotation of the Shoulders._--When the head is\r\ndelivered the shoulders come next, which also require to turn round a\r\nlittle, to adjust themselves to the long diameter of the lower strait;\r\nand as they turn within the Pelvis the head also turns, to correspond,\r\nand thus the back of it is brought opposite the middle of the mother's\r\nleft thigh. Immediately this movement is effected, the shoulders\r\nrapidly escape through the external opening, the right one being in\r\nfront, a little to the left of the symphysis pubes, and the left one\r\nbehind, a little to the right of the os coccygis. The body then curves\r\nupwards, to accommodate itself to the curved axis of the Pelvis, and\r\nspeedily follows the shoulders.\r\n\r\nThese curious movements cause the child to pass in a spiral direction,\r\nso that each part may pass through the Pelvis in the most favorable\r\nposition. Sometimes all these movements are not effected, and yet the\r\ndelivery may occur, though not so speedily, or safely, as when they\r\nare. The shoulders do not always fully rotate, but may nevertheless\r\npass the opening, if the parts be large, and well relaxed. It is\r\nquestionable however, if the head can ever pass the lower strait\r\nwithout rotating, when it enters the Pelvis diagonally, the occipit on\r\none side and the forehead on the other; as it is necessary for either\r\none or the other of these parts to pass under the pubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN ALL OTHER POSITIONS OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n_The right posterior occipital position._--This position, called the\r\n_second_ by some authors, and the _fourth_ by others, is exactly\r\nthe reverse of the one just described, the head lying in the same\r\ndirection, but the back of it being behind, to the right of the Sacrum,\r\nand the forehead to the left of the pubes.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same movements are gone through in this position as in\r\nthe other, excepting that the head has to rotate considerably further.\r\nIn the former position the back of the head is only a _little_ to the\r\nleft of the pubis, and therefore has not far to turn to pass under it;\r\nbut in this position the back of the head is _behind_, and therefore\r\nhas to turn very far round to reach the same position. The rotation is\r\ntherefore more difficult, not so soon effected, and sometimes likely to\r\nbe dangerous to the child.\r\n\r\nIn the other movements there are no difference worthy of notice, but it\r\nmust be borne in mind that they all occur the reverse way, to what they\r\ndo in the first position, because the occiput is on the _right_ side\r\ninstead of the left.\r\n\r\n_The right anterior occipital position._--This position is precisely\r\nthe same as the first, but on the other side. The back of the head\r\nis in front, but to the _right_ of the pubis instead of the left,\r\nwhile the forehead is behind, to the left of the Sacrum. This will be\r\napparent enough by observing Plate XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXXI.\r\n\r\n  This is the second most frequent position; the left anterior occipito\r\n  iliac being the _most_ frequent.\r\n\r\n  _a._ The Acetabulum, or socket of the hip joint.\r\n  _c._ The cut edge of the Womb.\r\n  c.

The pubic bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXI.\r\n\r\nHead in the _right_ anterior occiput iliac position.]\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of delivery is precisely the same, and all the movements\r\noccur in the same order and manner, as in the first position, but the\r\nreverse way. The rotation, for instance, being from right to left,\r\ninstead of from left to right, and so of all the others.\r\n\r\n_The left posterior occipital position._--Delivery is effected the same\r\nin this as in the left anterior, or first position, excepting that\r\nthe rotation is more extended, owing to the occiput being behind, as\r\nexplained in the right posterior occipital position.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nIn all the other positions, and their varieties, there is nothing that\r\ncalls for special notice, or that is material in practice, the delivery\r\nbeing nearly the same in them all. No matter what position the head is\r\nplaced in, the back of it nearly _always_ comes to the front, under\r\nthe pubes, even though it have to turn half round to do so. The cause\r\nof this is supposed to be the peculiar form of the parts, which give\r\nit a screw like motion, in its descent, and the shape of the external\r\nopening, which, being longest from before to behind, can only allow the\r\nlong diameter of the head to pass through in the same direction.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is true, the occiput passes behind, instead of coming to\r\nthe front, and then the _chin_ comes under the pubes, while the occiput\r\npresses on the coccygis. This is very seldom observed, and when it\r\noccurs the labor is more difficult and tedious, though it may still\r\nterminate spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the soft parts, externally, appears to be the chief\r\ncause of the head turning; for when they are much relaxed, and the\r\nchild's head small, it will sometimes pass without, or in the anterior\r\nposterior position. And sometimes, when the head is large, so that it\r\ndistends the parts very much, the shoulders will pass cross wise, there\r\nbeing room enough for them without turning. In some females, formed\r\nlarge, whose organs are excessively relaxed, and whose children are\r\nsmall, the delivery takes place without _any_ of the movements being\r\neffected, the child passing straight through in whatever position it\r\nmay happen to be: this is rarely seen however.\r\n\r\nWhen there are twins they do not usually both present by the head, but\r\none by the feet; and frequently the parts are so relaxed by the passage\r\nof the first, that the second is delivered without rotating at all,\r\nthough in general it follows precisely the same movements. It sometimes\r\nhappens however, that the second birth does not take place till some\r\nhours, or even days, after the first.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, in general, that all positions of the head are\r\nfavorable to both mother and child, and may terminate spontaneously. It\r\nis seldom that anything more than ordinary assistance is required in\r\nany of them, and they could in general terminate without any at all,\r\nthough sometimes with difficulty. The worst cases are those in which\r\nthe head does not turn round, but remains across, or where the back\r\nof it turns behind, instead of coming to the front. In these cases\r\nthere is great danger of the perineum, or external lips, being much\r\nlacerated, or even of an artificial passage being torn through the\r\nperineum, leading to the most serious after results. About one child\r\nalso, out of every fifty, is lost in these unfavorable positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis presentation includes the feet, the knees, the breech, and also\r\nthe hips, there being no difference in the delivery for all these\r\nparts. It is the same also whether there be one foot, or knee, or both\r\nfeet and knees.\r\n\r\nThere are but two positions worthy of notice in this presentation,\r\nand they are determined by the child's sacrum. If the sacrum, or\r\nposteriors, are to the right of the mother's Pelvis, it is called the\r\n_right sacro iliac position_; but if they are on the left side it is\r\ncalled the _left sacro iliac position_. The direction in which the\r\nchild's pelvis is placed, is analagous to that of the head, the sacrum\r\nanswering to the occiput. Thus most frequently the sacrum is on the\r\nleft side, a little to the left of the pubes, (_left anterior_) while\r\nthe abdomen faces the right side near the sacrum. When on the right\r\nside however, it is most usually nearest the sacrum, with the abdomen\r\nfacing the left side near the pubes.\r\n\r\nThe lower extremities present most frequently next after the head, but\r\nstill they are but seldom met with. M. P. Dubois tells us that out of\r\n_twenty thousand labors_ he only met with _eighty-five_ such cases. In\r\nthese eighty-five cases the breech presented _fifty-four_ times, and\r\nthe feet _twenty-six_, the knees being found _but once_.\r\n\r\nA presentation of the lower extremities may generally be recognized\r\nat an early stage, by the head being felt at the _fundus_ of the\r\nUterus, and by the pulsations of the fœtal heart being heard above the\r\numbilicus, as explained in the section on Auscultation. After labor has\r\ncommenced the part felt at the mouth of the Womb is irregular, and so\r\ndifferent from the head, that it is not likely to be mistaken for it.\r\nIf the knees or feet present, they can always be distinguished; and\r\nif the breech presents it can easily be recognized by its form, and\r\nparticularly by the os coccygis, which can be distinctly felt at the\r\nbottom of the depression between the two cheeks. The side on which it\r\nis felt of course determines the position, and the same with the front\r\nof the knees, or the heels. The Rectum can also be reached with the\r\nfinger, when the breech is touched; but great care must be taken not\r\nto intrude it too far, because with a female child the _Vulva_ might\r\nbe mistaken for it, and thus the hymen be broken, and other injury\r\ncommitted. The genitals of a male child are more obvious, so that the\r\nsex of the child may be usually ascertained, along with the position.\r\n\r\nFor want of proper care the breech has been mistaken for the head, and\r\nface, but this can scarcely happen if the accoucheur is attentive.\r\nIt is simply necessary to call to mind what _must_ be felt in each\r\npresentation, as the _nose_ and _mouth_ with the face; the two cheeks\r\nof the posteriors, with the opening between them; and also the\r\ngenitals, with the breech; and it can be certainly ascertained which of\r\nthese parts are really at the opening. With the knees or feet there can\r\nscarcely be a doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY IN A BREECH PRESENTATION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR SACRO-ILIAC\r\nPOSITION.\r\n\r\nIn this position the legs and thighs are turned up against the\r\nabdomen, the breech in full occupying the passage, with the sacrum to\r\nthe left and in front of the mother's pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the breech usually takes place without much difficulty,\r\ninto the Pelvis, it being small and easily compressed. It descends in\r\nthe same direction in which it first presents--that is diagonally, like\r\nthe head--and also rotates, or turns round, so that the left buttock\r\ncomes in front, just to the right of the pubis, while the right one\r\ngoes behind, to the left of the sacrum. The left buttock reaches the\r\nmouth of the Vulva first, in this position, and then remains stationary\r\nthere while the right one slides along the curve of the sacrum and\r\nperineum, and passes out first at the lower part of the external\r\nopening. The left however, speedily follows, and when the whole breech\r\nis born it rotates again, one hip coming immediately in front, and\r\nthe other going immediately behind. Owing to this movement the long\r\ndiameter of the breech is adapted to the long diameter of the Pelvis,\r\nas in the case of the head. This will be evident from the following\r\nPlate:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\n Delivery in a breech presentation, the buttocks having just passed the\r\n Vulva.\r\n\r\n  _c._ The Coccygis, much straightened.\r\n  _p._ The pubic bone, in front.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the body then rotates in the same way, and the arms and\r\nshoulders pass through the external opening in the same direction as\r\nthe hips. The left shoulder first moves to the right of the pubes,\r\nwhile the left passes behind; and then, just when they are both passing\r\nout, one comes immediately in front, and the other immediately behind,\r\nplacing themselves in the long diameter of the Vulva.\r\n\r\nThe head passes through the superior strait in the left, anterior\r\noccipital position, and is often delivered in that way; but sometimes\r\nit rotates, and the forehead passes into the curve of the sacrum, while\r\nthe occiput is placed behind the pubes. When this occurs the body also\r\nrotates, to accompany the head. This state of the parts is represented\r\nin the following Plate:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII.\r\n\r\n Anterior posterior position of the head, the occiput being in front,\r\n after the delivery of the body.\r\n\r\n  _c._ The Coccygis.\r\n  _p._ The pubic bone, in front.]\r\n\r\nAt this period the head is passed the uterus, and there is therefore\r\nlittle or no contraction to expel it, so that it often remains a\r\nlong time undelivered. It will be seen that the position is very\r\nunfavorable, the longest diameter of the head, the occipito frontal,\r\nbeing the presenting one, which makes it lie immoveably across. The\r\nmeans of assisting in such a case are plain enough, the forehead must\r\nbe brought down while the body is _raised_, towards the mother's\r\nabdomen; this will throw the top of the head back, towards the sacrum,\r\nand change the presenting diameter. The forehead and bregma rapidly\r\nescape below, and the occiput passes out last. This is the way in which\r\nnature herself also completes the delivery in such cases, when she has\r\nthe power.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY BY THE BREECH IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR SACRO ILIAC POSITION.\r\n\r\nThis position is the reverse of the preceding one, the Sacrum being\r\nbehind, and to the right, while the Abdomen is to the left in front.\r\nThe same movements are performed as in the first position, and the\r\nwhole process is similar, only the reverse way. The Sacrum being behind\r\nhowever, has to rotate much further to come in front, precisely the\r\nsame as with the head when in the posterior position.\r\n\r\nThe head generally follows the Sacrum, and the occiput comes under the\r\npubes, as already explained; but sometimes only at the moment when\r\nbeing disengaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY BY THE BREECH IN THE FULL POSTERIOR, OR SACRO SACRAL POSITION.\r\n\r\nIn this position there is no rotation at all, the back of the child\r\nbeing turned full to the back of the mother, and the whole body,\r\nand head, being expelled in that position. In general there is no\r\nparticular difficulty from this position, but on the contrary it is\r\nthought by some to be rather favorable than otherwise. The longest\r\ndiameter of the fœtal pelvis, and shoulders, are adapted to the longest\r\ndiameter of the mother's pelvis, at the upper strait, and easily pass\r\nit. They will also generally pass the external opening in the same\r\ndirection, unless it be very unyielding, or the child very large; and\r\nif they pass the head usually follows, because the parts have been so\r\nmuch dilated by the passage of the body that they offer but little\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule delivery by the breech, or by any other position of\r\nthe lower extremities, is less favorable than by the head. The labor is\r\nusually longer, more painful, and more exhausting; still however, it is\r\ngenerally spontaneous, and not necessarily dangerous to the mother. To\r\nthe child, on the contrary, it is dangerous, on many accounts.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the observations of M. P. Dubois, that in this\r\npresentation _one child is lost out of every twelve_, while only one\r\nout of _fifty_ is lost in head presentations! The chief cause for this\r\ngreater mortality appears to be _the compression of the umbilical\r\ncord_, which is greater, and lasts much longer, than when the head\r\npresents, as will be evident on examining the circumstances under which\r\ndelivery is effected in each case. When the head presents it passes,\r\nand also the shoulders, before the umbilicus is reached; the mother's\r\norgans are therefore much dilated, and only the smallest parts of the\r\nfœtus are left, when the cord is engaged in the passage; it cannot\r\ntherefore be much compressed, nor for any long time, because the labor\r\nis then soon over. When the lower extremities present this is not the\r\ncase, the _smallest_ parts then pass before the umbilicus is reached,\r\nso that the cord has to pass along with the head and shoulders,\r\nwhich are both the largest and the longest in being delivered. This\r\ncompression of the cord stops the circulation of blood between the\r\nfœtus and the Placenta, as will be evident on referring to the\r\ndescription formerly given of _Fœtal nutrition_; and the stopping of\r\nthis circulation is as fatal, to it, as stopping the breath is to an\r\nadult. When the breech presents altogether, there is not so much danger\r\nas with the feet, or knees, because it is large, and in its passage\r\ndilates the parts so much that the rest of the body, and the head,\r\nfollow more quickly. There is, of course, no danger till after the hips\r\nhave passed, because the cord is not reached before; but the delivery\r\nshould be completed as soon after they are born as possible, for every\r\nminute's delay makes the chances for the child's life so much less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresentations of the face appear to result from the head being bent\r\nbackwards, instead of forwards upon the chest. They are easily\r\nrecognized, because the face has so many peculiar parts, as the nose\r\nand mouth, for instance, which are altogether unlike what can be felt\r\nin any other presentation. In a very early stage the forehead may be\r\ntaken for the vortex, unless care be used, because it _feels_ round and\r\nsoft like it, but the mistake cannot last long.\r\n\r\nThe positions in this presentation, as formerly explained, are\r\ndetermined by the chin, and in practice only two are noticed--the\r\n_right posterior mento iliac_, and the _left anterior mento iliac_.\r\nIn the first the chin is on the right side, near the sacrum, and in\r\nthe second it is on the left side, near the pubes. These answer, it\r\nwill be seen, to the two principal positions of the head itself. It\r\nis generally considered that, though the chin, like the head, may\r\nassume other positions, yet it does so in but very few cases, and these\r\npresenting no peculiarities which require special notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR MENTO ILIAC POSITION OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\nThe head descends with the forehead and chin nearly on a level, and the\r\nnose occupying the middle of the passage. When fairly in the cavity\r\nit rotates, the chin being brought under the pubes, while the back of\r\nthe head passes into the curve of the sacrum. This is nearly always the\r\nprocess; no matter where the chin may be when the labor commences, it\r\nseldom fails to move under the pubes before it concludes. Occasionally\r\nit may rotate the other way, and pass into the hollow of the sacrum,\r\nwhile the occiput comes in front, but this is very rare.\r\n\r\nThe chin is born first, and then follows, below, the forehead, top of\r\nthe head, and finally the occiput--the face turning upwards towards\r\nthe mother's abdomen, as each part is successively delivered. When the\r\nhead is fully born, the body rotates inside the same as in the head\r\npresentation, and the delivery concludes in precisely the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--The chin just passed, in presentation of the face.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--The head full born in presentation of the face.--_p._ The\r\nPubic bone.--_c._ The Coccygis.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY IN OTHER POSITIONS OF THE FACE.\r\n\r\nThe delivery is precisely the same in all the other positions of the\r\nface, excepting that in some of them the chin has further to rotate\r\nbefore it can pass under the pubes. In all cases however, it may\r\nbe safely calculated that it will do so, there having been so few\r\ninstances known in which it has rotated the other way, into the hollow\r\nof the sacrum, which is fortunate, for there is always more or less\r\ndifficulty and danger when it does so.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rotation does not take place at all, but the face\r\ndescends diagonally, as the head occasionally does.\r\n\r\nOn the whole presentations of the face are not particularly to be\r\nfeared, as regards the mother. Some authors even consider them quite\r\nfavorable, and reckon them only as varieties of the head presentation.\r\nMadame Lachapelle states as a principle, that face presentations should\r\nalways be left to nature. And M. Chailly says he must admit that, in\r\nall positions of the face, the labor may terminate spontaneously,\r\nexcepting when the chin passes behind, in which case it will be\r\nprotracted, and most likely fatal to the child. The labor is generally\r\na little longer, and more painful, owing to the face not being so\r\nperfectly adapted to the passage as the head is; but still it must\r\nbe regarded as favorable to the mother, though assistance is oftener\r\nrequired than with the head. There is more or less danger to the child\r\nhowever, owing to the head being kept under pressure for an unusual\r\ntime, which produces congestion. The neck is also forced against the\r\npubic bone, as will be seen by Figs. 1 and 2, Plate XXXIV, and thus the\r\njugular veins are compressed. If there be any delay, it is customary\r\nto observe the face closely, after the chin is born; and if it appears\r\nfrom any indications that congestion is taking place, assistance is\r\nrendered at once. The face will sometimes become so tumefied, and\r\nengorged with blood, from this prolonged pressure, that it will not\r\nappear natural till several days after birth.\r\n\r\nProbably about one child is lost in ten or twelve deliveries in these\r\ncases; and if the chin pass behind its death is almost certain.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the practice to endeavor to turn the face upwards,\r\nwhen at the superior strait, and so change the presentation to one\r\nof the head. This however, is now abandoned, because the attempt is\r\nseldom successful, and does not materially improve the condition of\r\nthings, besides being painful to the mother. The only extra danger\r\nwith the face presenting is to the child, and this is not removed by\r\nthe operation; to the mother the face is nearly as favorable as the\r\ncranium. In regard to the frequency of face presentations, we find that\r\nMadame Lachapelle met with but _seventy-two_ cases in _fifteen thousand\r\nsix hundred and fifty-two deliveries_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUNK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that in presentations of the Trunk it is\r\nnearly always the right or left shoulder which occupies the passage. It\r\nis stated, by some authors, that they have felt the back, and abdomen,\r\nbut others think they were mistaken; and most certainly such positions\r\nare extremely rare, if they actually do ever exist.\r\n\r\nThere are two presentations of the Trunk, determined by the side on\r\nwhich the fœtus lies, and denominated accordingly _right_ or _left\r\nlateral presentations_.\r\n\r\nEach of these presentations has two corresponding positions, determined\r\nby the side on which the child's head lies. If the head be on the\r\nmother's right side it is called the _right cephalo iliac position_,\r\nand if it be on the left side it is denominated the _left cephalo\r\niliac position_. The mechanism of spontaneous delivery is the same in\r\nthem both, and in all their varieties, and so is the mode of rendering\r\nassistance, so that a description of one will suffice.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the labor has lasted long without assistance, one arm\r\nwill be forced down first, and even appear externally. This used to\r\nbe considered a separate presentation, and described as such, under\r\nthe name of _presentation of the hand and arm_. There is no reason for\r\ndescribing it separately however, and no utility in doing so, as it\r\ndiffers in no essential particular from ordinary presentation of the\r\nshoulders, and must receive the same assistance.\r\n\r\nWhat it is that produces presentations of the Trunk, and other\r\nunfavorable parts, is not known, though they are generally thought to\r\nbe owing to excessive motion in the child, or obliquities of the Womb.\r\n\r\nM. Lachapelle met with _sixty-eight_ cases of Trunk presentation in\r\n_fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty-two labors_, which is nearly\r\nthe same as the face. The right side presents more frequently than the\r\nleft, and the head is on the left side oftener than on the right, as it\r\nis in ordinary head presentations.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule assistance is always rendered in presentations of\r\nthe Trunk, and is generally considered absolutely necessary. It is\r\nundoubtedly true however, that nature has effected delivery in such\r\ncases unaided, though rarely, and such instances are considered as\r\nextremely fortunate exceptions to the general rule. M. Chailly says\r\nthat the accoucheur should never leave such cases to nature alone, but\r\nalways aid her; but other authors trust to her a little more. The most\r\nusual mode of rendering assistance is to _turn the child_, and bring\r\ndown the feet, a manœuvre which will be fully described hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the child turns itself, from the contractions of the\r\nWomb, before it enters the upper strait; and in other cases, when very\r\nsmall, or long dead, it will pass folded double. This self-turning\r\nhowever, cannot take place after the escape of the waters, so that it\r\nseldom occurs when the membranes are broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF DELIVERY IN PRESENTATIONS OF THE TRUNK BY SPONTANEOUS\r\nEVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThis is the most usual mode for the fœtus to escape, in each\r\npresentation, and in every position. By referring to the following\r\nPlates, and the accompanying descriptions, it will be readily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXV.\r\n\r\n_Position of the Fœtus in a presentation of the right shoulder, and in\r\nthe left cephalo iliac position._]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the rupture of the membranes the child's body lies\r\n_across_, as formerly explained; but immediately after the rupture the\r\nshoulders descend into the Pelvis, as seen in the above Plate, while\r\nthe head remains above the pubes; the arm frequently, but not always,\r\nprotruding externally.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder then continues to descend, the body following, bent up\r\nagainst the face, as seen in Plate XXXVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVI.\r\n\r\n_Descent of the shoulder in a Trunk presentation, at a more advanced\r\nperiod._]\r\n\r\nHere the shoulder is protruded from the Vulva, the back being nearly\r\nfolded, and the knees turned up against the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVII.\r\n\r\n_Descent of the shoulder and trunk at a still later period._]\r\n\r\nThe whole Trunk is now fully delivered, folded almost double, and the\r\nlegs and feet are turned up against the face. They speedily follow\r\nhowever, and then nothing is left but the head, and perhaps one or both\r\narms, placed against the sides of it, as shown in Plate XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Trunk has fully descended, and only the head is left, with one\r\narm._]\r\n\r\nThe arm is generally very easily brought down, or it may remain and\r\ncome with the head. The delivery of the head is effected the same\r\nas in presentations of the pelvis, and is seldom attended with much\r\ndifficulty, the parts having been so much distended. The body always\r\nrotates so that the back comes in front, and the chin passes into the\r\ncurve of the Sacrum.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which the delivery is effected by nature in such\r\ncases, and it will readily be conceived how dangerous it is to both\r\nmother and child, and how seldom it can be accomplished. If the Fœtus\r\nbe of a full size, and the mother's pelvis no larger than ordinary,\r\nit is almost impossible for this spontaneous evolution to take place;\r\nand even when it does, it is with the greatest difficulty, the mother\r\nsuffering in an extreme degree, and running great risk, not only of the\r\nmost serious after results, but even of death. To the child the danger\r\nis equally great, owing to the severe and long-continued compression\r\nit receives, and the unnatural position it assumes. M. Velpeau tells\r\nus that in _one hundred and thirty-seven_ such cases, _one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five_ of the children died. The number of the mothers also,\r\nwho either died or were made sufferers all their future lives, was\r\nundoubtedly great, though unknown.\r\n\r\nIt is evident therefore, that presentations of the Trunk are the most\r\nunfavorable known, and labor in them is but rarely spontaneous. Nature\r\ncan but very seldom effect the delivery of the Fœtus herself, and even\r\nwhen she does it is with the greatest risk, both to it and the mother.\r\nThe accoucheur should _always_ assist therefore, if he can, because\r\neven if nature can complete the delivery it is with such danger. The\r\nmeans of assisting, by turning, will be described in another Chapter.\r\n\r\nIf the fœtus is not at full term, and of course is under the full size,\r\nits expulsion may be left to nature safely, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSIOLOGY OF SPONTANEOUS DELIVERY, OR CHILDBIRTH, AND THE MANNER\r\nOF CONDUCTING A NATURAL LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now completed the description of the _Mechanism of Delivery_, in\r\nall the various presentations and positions, it is necessary to explain\r\nthe physiological phenomena attending a natural labor, and the duties\r\nof the accoucheur when conducting it, and to show what assistance he\r\ncan render, and when he should or should not interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOF DELIVERY IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF DELIVERY.\r\n\r\nWhen the child is brought into the world by the unaided efforts of\r\nnature, and without any accident to itself or the mother, it is called\r\na _Natural Delivery_. When it occurs by the efforts of nature alone,\r\nbut not advantageously for both, it is not called natural, but simply\r\n_Spontaneous Delivery_. And when assistance is required it is called an\r\n_Artificial_, or _difficult Delivery_. It is also called _precocious_,\r\nor _tardy_, according as it comes before or after the full term.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF LABOR.\r\n\r\nWhat it is that causes labor to commence, and proceed, is not fully\r\nknown. At the proper time the Uterus prepares to cast out the fœtus it\r\nhas so long retained, in the same manner that the tree casts off its\r\nfruit, and from some efficient cause which we have not yet discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, when the fœtus attains a certain size, it presses\r\nupon the nerves of the neck of the Uterus and irritates them, and\r\nthey react again upon the muscular fibres of the Womb and cause them\r\nto contract, and so expel its contents. This is much the same action,\r\nin fact, as vomiting. When any body very repugnant to the stomach\r\nis swallowed, it irritates the nerves of that organ, and then they\r\nexcite its muscular fibres, which, by forcible contractions, expel the\r\noffender.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, also, that the fœtus itself may instinctively assist in\r\nbringing about its own delivery, as was supposed of old by Hippocrates,\r\nand more lately by Harvey and others. It is certain that labor is both\r\nmore difficult, and more dangerous, when the child is dead; though it\r\nmay take place as usual after the death of the mother, providing the\r\nchild be still alive. Several instances of this kind have been known,\r\nwhen the living child was expelled from the Womb, by the natural\r\nprocess, sometime after the mother had ceased to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe contraction of the muscular fibres of the Womb however, must be\r\nregarded as the immediate or efficient cause of fœtal expulsion, let\r\nthem be brought on how they may. The muscles of the Abdomen, and the\r\ndiaphragm, also assist, in the last stage, but are not essential.\r\n\r\nThe young of some of the lower animals are observed to perform certain\r\npeculiar motions, during delivery, by which it is much facilitated;\r\nand this is considered a proof, by some, that voluntary movements of\r\nthe fœtus assist in the process. Certainly if it be supposed, as we\r\nhave shown there is good grounds for doing, that the child assists in\r\nplacing itself in the best _position_, it is equally probable that it\r\nalso assists in its own expulsion, in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF DELIVERY.\r\n\r\n_Premonitory Signs._--A few days before delivery the Uterus descends\r\nmuch lower, so that the diaphragm and stomach are less pressed upon,\r\nand the breathing and digestion becomes easier in consequence. The\r\nease which is thus experienced is sometimes so great that the female\r\nbecomes unusually animated and cheerful, and cannot think she is so\r\nnear her travail. This is not always the case however, for some on\r\nthe contrary feel very uncomfortable and melancholy. The lips of the\r\nVulva are also apt to swell and become painful, and the lower limbs\r\nnumbed and cramped, owing to the child's head pressing on the large\r\nnerves. The neck of the bladder is also very liable to be compressed,\r\nso that a constant desire is felt to urinate, and a similar trouble may\r\nalso be experienced in the Rectum. Most of these inconveniences, but\r\nparticularly the numbness and cramps in the limbs, are not likely to be\r\nexperienced except when the head presents, because no other part is so\r\nformed as to be able to descend sufficiently low; when they are felt\r\ntherefore, the female may console herself by the reflection that they\r\nindicate, with tolerable certainty, that the child is presenting in the\r\nbest position it can for a safe and speedy delivery.\r\n\r\nStanding, or walking, usually become more difficult, and swelling of\r\nthe external parts, or piles, are apt to occur. With some females also,\r\na sudden diarrhœa, or vomiting, takes place, and troubles them up to\r\nthe period when labor commences.\r\n\r\nFinally the Uterus begins to contract, though insensibly at first;\r\nthe Abdomen becomes unusually hard, and flying pains are experienced,\r\nparticularly with first children. This continues with more or less\r\nof intermission, up to the actual period of labor, which is usually\r\ndivided into _three_ periods, each of which must be considered\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS, PHENOMENA, AND DURATION OF NATURAL LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\nOn making an examination the mouth of the Womb will be found to\r\nbe dilating, and a discharge of mucus, tinged with blood, issuing\r\nfrom it. The membranes may also be felt protruding into the Vagina,\r\nand distended, like a bladder. The female complains of being drawn\r\npowerfully together in the inside; she trembles, and gasps for breath;\r\nher pulse sinks, and she often becomes sick and deadly faint; she\r\ncomplains of great thirst, and breaks out into profuse perspiration;\r\nfrequently she will weep, and apparently suffer from some terrible\r\napprehension, while her strength will be completely exhausted.\r\nOccasionally however, she will be perfectly passive, and almost\r\nimmoveable, appearing as if in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe pains however, gradually become more and more acute, and closer\r\ntogether; the patient is excited and irritable; her pulse becomes\r\nquicker again, the thirst increases, and vomiting frequently ensues.\r\nBefore each pain she frequently experiences a severe chill, with\r\nchattering of the teeth, and not unfrequently becomes perfectly\r\ndelirious.\r\n\r\nWith each pain the mouth of the Womb expands more and more, till at\r\nlast it totally disappears, and the cavity of the Uterus and the Vagina\r\nform but one uniform passage, which is completely occupied with the\r\ndistended membranes, or bag of waters, which may be felt like a soft\r\nround tumor. This is well represented in the following Plate:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVIII.--_a._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.      Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the state of the parts at the beginning of labor. The\r\nmouth of the Womb is considerably dilated, and the Membranes, A, are\r\nprotruding slightly.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 shows the state of the parts at the end of the first period. The\r\nneck of the Womb is now so fully dilated that it forms a continuous\r\npassage with the Vagina, while the bag of waters, A, projects far down\r\nand occupies the whole width of the canal.]\r\n\r\nThe first period may be much protracted, and is generally very\r\nexhausting, though not attended with any danger or special difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\nAt this stage all the previous symptoms become much exaggerated. The\r\ncontractions are more powerful, and the pains more acute, but with\r\na perfect period of repose between them, during which the female\r\nwill feel quite easy, and even sometimes fall asleep, but only to be\r\naroused by the pains coming on again. The muscles of the Abdomen,\r\nand the diaphragm, are now called into play; the patient strains, or\r\nviolently bears down, and pants with exertion, while the perspiration\r\nstreams from every pore, the pulse quickens, and the expression of the\r\ncountenance betrays the wildest anxiety and excitement.\r\n\r\nThe bag of waters now descends, and enlarges more and more, until\r\nat last, being unable any longer to bear the strain to which it is\r\nsubject, it bursts, and the waters flow away in a profuse gush.\r\nImmediately this takes place the head descends, and closes up the\r\npassage; the pains cease for a time, and the patient again has a\r\nrespite, while the uterus apparently gains fresh power. Very soon the\r\ncontractions recommence, more energetically even than before, the\r\nhead passes the mouth of the Womb and enters the Vagina, which keeps\r\nenlarging as it descends, till it reaches the lower part, or floor of\r\nthe pelvis. The pains now become more violent than ever, the patient\r\nscreams with agony, clutches hold of any object near her, throws\r\nherself back, draws in her breath, and bears down with all the force\r\nshe can command.\r\n\r\nThe fearful cries which most females emit at this time appear to\r\nassist the delivery, by the convulsive efforts at breathing which they\r\nnecessitate, and the expulsive straining also does the same. These\r\nnatural efforts are much assisted by providing a firm support for the\r\npatient's feet, against which she can push, which she will do with\r\ntremendous force.\r\n\r\nThe head now presses, at each pain, against the perineum, which begins\r\nto project outwards, as also does the Rectum. The Vulva begins to\r\ndilate, the lips separate wider and wider, and part of the child's head\r\nbecomes visible. Gradually the lips become thinner and thinner, and at\r\nlast disappear nearly altogether, so that the mouth of the Vulva is\r\nonly composed of thin ring, which seems ready to give way every moment.\r\nThe head however recedes, and the parts again assume something like\r\ntheir natural condition for a short time, when the same process again\r\ntakes place, and the distension proceeds still further, while the head\r\ndoes not retire so far. This alternate action is repeated perhaps many\r\ntimes, so that the external mouth is opened gradually, and without the\r\nlips or perineum being torn, which they would be if the head were to\r\npass suddenly, before they were softened and dilated.\r\n\r\nAfter this has been continued for a sufficient period a strong\r\nexpulsive pain is felt, the female screams, the head passes clean\r\nthrough the external opening, and the lips close round the neck.\r\nThis however, is only for an instant, the rest of the body speedily\r\nfollowing the head, in the manner hereafter to be explained. Most\r\nusually, in fact, the whole body follows the head without any stoppage\r\nat all, but sometimes there is a delay of a few seconds.\r\n\r\n_The Third period of delivery_ comprises the delivery of the Placenta,\r\nwhich will occupy our attention in another place.\r\n\r\n_Differences in the process of Labor._--Although, in most cases, labor\r\nproceeds much in the way I have just explained, and is attended with\r\nsimilar phenomena, yet still we occasionally see marked exceptions.\r\nThis is particularly the case with regard to _pain_. Most females\r\nsuffer severely at this time, and some even the most torturing agony,\r\nwhile others again experience scarcely anything to complain of, and\r\nsome even feel nothing at all. I am acquainted with a lady at the\r\npresent time, the mother of several children, who assures me she never\r\nfelt any pain at all in her labors, nor was she in any ways exhausted\r\nby them. I have known her rise from her bed in the night, from feeling\r\nindications of the approaching event, make all her arrangements, and\r\nsend for the nurse, as if it was the most ordinary affair imaginable.\r\nOn one of these occasions, before her husband returned with the\r\nassistants, she was delivered while alone, without any difficulty, and\r\nthey found her sitting up in bed nursing the child. She had cut it\r\nloose, and tied up the cord herself, having heard how to do so at one\r\nof my Lectures, and actually brought away the Placenta with her own\r\nhand. In two days after she was about as usual. And yet this lady was\r\nby no means strong, nor remarkably healthy; and what is very singular,\r\nshe suffered severe pains at most of her monthly periods; much more,\r\nas she assured me, than from all her labors put together. M. Chailly\r\nalso mentions an instance of a young girl of sixteen, with her first\r\npregnancy, whose Vagina was also partly closed by an internal membrane,\r\nwhose delivery nevertheless was almost painless. She woke up, he tells\r\nus, about four o'clock in the morning, with some very slight pains,\r\nwhich scarcely disturbed her, but which continued till about six, when\r\nthe child was born suddenly and safely, without any assistance, and\r\nwith scarcely any increase of pain to the mother. I have known many\r\nother such cases as these, and plenty of them can be found recorded;\r\nbut what this fortunate exemption from suffering, in such cases,\r\ndepends upon, is not known.\r\n\r\nThe nature, and the seat of the pains, is also very variable. Some\r\nonly feel a dull sort of aching, with powerful contraction, or drawing\r\ntogether, while others call it _grinding_, _cutting_, and _burning_\r\npain. Some feel it in the back, and some at front, while others feel\r\nit most in the groins, and others again experience it in all these\r\nparts at once. The peculiar sharp pain which results from the extreme\r\ndilatation of the external mouth, when the head passes, is perhaps the\r\nmost constantly felt, and the most alike in all.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the mouth of the Womb opens, and the time required\r\nfor its dilatation, differ much in different cases. In females who have\r\npreviously borne children, as before explained, the mouth is always\r\nconsiderably opened at the full term, while in a first pregnancy it is\r\nnearly closed, even till some time after the labor actually commences.\r\nSometimes the dilatation takes place rapidly, and at others very\r\nslowly; it is especially liable to be delayed if the Membranes break\r\ntoo soon, because then the pressure of the bag of waters is lost, and\r\nthat is an important agent in expanding the Os Uteri. In some cases\r\nthe neck of the Womb is very hard and rigid, so that a long time\r\nis required to make it give way. When any other part than the head\r\npresents also, the opening of the mouth will not take place so soon,\r\nbecause no other part so completely fills up the passage.\r\n\r\nThe breaking of the bag of waters will sometimes occur very early,\r\nalmost as soon as it protrudes; while at other times it will be\r\ndelayed till the whole Vagina is filled up by it, or even till it\r\nappears externally. The quantity of the water discharged at the time of\r\nthe rupture is also variable; if the presenting part of the fœtus does\r\nnot completely block up the passage, the whole may pass away when the\r\nrupture takes place; but if it does, as is usually the case when the\r\nhead presents, only a part flows then, and the rest comes in gushes, as\r\nthe head is raised, and when the child is born. The too early escape of\r\nthe waters, as already explained, may retard the delivery, by delaying\r\nthe expansion of the mouth of the Womb; and in this way unskilful\r\naccoucheurs have caused lingering labors, by breaking the membranes too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recollect also, as I explained before, that a\r\nportion of fluid sometimes exists between the amnion and chorion,\r\nwhich may pass first, and induce the belief that the true waters have\r\nescaped, when they have not. This is called the _false waters_, or\r\n_shows_, and is not connected with the true waters at all.\r\n\r\nThe _general_ physiological phenomena of a natural delivery having thus\r\nbeen explained, we have now to state its duration, and then proceed to\r\nits conduct or management.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF NATURAL LABOR.\r\n\r\nThe duration of natural labor is not by any means constantly the same,\r\nnor can it be predicted with anything like certainty in any case;\r\nbut still by keeping careful records, and by duly observing a vast\r\nnumber of cases, a tolerable approximation can be made. There are\r\nvarious circumstances that tend to lengthen the duration of labor, some\r\ngeneral, and others belonging to the individual. The mode of life and\r\nearly habits of the female, the climate in which she lives, and the\r\nmanner in which she has conducted herself during gestation, all have\r\nan important influence. As a general rule, the period becomes longer\r\nin proportion to the civilization of the community in which she lives.\r\nThe first labor is generally more tedious than the succeeding ones,\r\nowing to the slower dilatation of the parts. It is also thought by\r\nsome, that the labor is longer in proportion to the age of the female,\r\nparticularly with the first child; but this opinion is not well founded.\r\n\r\nThe average duration of labor in our country, is _from eight to twelve\r\nhours_. In some parts it is longer than this, and in others again it is\r\nmuch shorter. I have good reason also to think, that it is longer in\r\ncities than in the country.\r\n\r\nAn experienced practitioner can sometimes predict with tolerable\r\ncertainty, when called to a labor, how long it will be before it is\r\nover; but this is seldom the case, and most frequently his success is\r\nowing more to chance than to judgment. If the mouth of the womb be well\r\ndilated, the contractions powerful, and the patient vigorous, with the\r\npresentation natural, he is of course justified in predicting a speedy\r\ndelivery; or the reverse, if these favorable conditions do not exist.\r\nMany unforeseen conditions may exist, however, and many accidents\r\narise, that may falsify an apparently safe conclusion. No judicious\r\npractitioner, except in a few rare cases, will hazard his reputation by\r\nfixing any _time_, and no well informed patient would _ask_ him to do\r\nso, because she would know that it was out of his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONDUCT OR MANAGEMENT OF A NATURAL LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REQUISITES.\r\n\r\nIn most cases of natural labor there is not much assistance needed.\r\nThe assistant should, however, possess a certain _tact_, or _manner_,\r\ncalculated to make a favorable impression on the patient. This is\r\nespecially needed _when a man officiates_. It must be recollected,\r\nthat the situation of the female at such times is a very peculiar one,\r\nand that the presence of one of the other sex, however necessary, must\r\nbe more or less objectionable to her. He should, therefore, carefully\r\nexhibit in his behavior the most refined delicacy, combined with a\r\nwarm sympathy and kind consideration; thus soothing her scruples and\r\nenlisting her gratitude. He must also appear perfectly self-possessed\r\nunder all circumstances, and then she will have full confidence in\r\nhis skill and judgment. It may seem scarcely necessary to state\r\nthese things, but I have often known men officiate without such\r\nqualifications, and also be perfectly unaware of their deficiencies.\r\nSuch accoucheurs never officiate well; they may be skillful and\r\nattentive, but yet unsuccessful, and unappreciated. They are only\r\n_tolerated_, but not respected, and are never fully confided in.\r\n\r\nWhen requested to see a woman supposed to be in labor, it is always\r\nadvisable to be prompt in paying the visit, because delivery sometimes\r\ncomes on suddenly and unexpectedly, and both mother and child may be\r\nin great danger if no one is near to assist.\r\n\r\nSome time before the event is expected, it is advisable to provide\r\ncertain articles, which will or may be needed at the time, and which\r\nshould not have to be looked for at the last moment. A pair of sharp\r\nscissors, with a piece of strong thread or cord, are indispensable, and\r\na female catheter may be needed. A quill with the feather part on, may\r\nalso be useful; and some pure lard or sweet oil is frequently called\r\nfor. The professional accoucheur will also find it a good precaution\r\nto have his stethoscope in his pocket, and a lancet, if he ever relies\r\nupon bleeding in any contingency. A small box of extract of Belladonna\r\nalso, may often be of great and immediate service.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe first thing required when visiting the patient, is of course\r\nto ascertain positively whether she be pregnant, and whether labor\r\nis really commenced, and if so how far it has progressed. This\r\nnecessitates an examination, the proposal and making of which require\r\nthe most delicate tact, particularly if it be with a comparative\r\nstranger, or in a first labor. No allusion to it should be made to the\r\npatient herself by the assistant; he should converse with _her_ about\r\nindifferent matters, or merely upon her health, and state his wishes to\r\nthe _nurse_ or female friend, and then retire. This gives them time to\r\ninform her of what is required, and to make the necessary preparation.\r\nOn entering the room again, he should not proceed abruptly, but resume\r\nthe conversation, and make some of the necessary arrangements while\r\ncarrying it on. He should seat himself by the side of the bed, with\r\nhis right hand next her, and his face opposite hers. Then passing\r\nhis hand under the bed clothes, after having lubricated it with lard\r\nor oil, he can proceed with the examination as if it were a simple\r\nordinary proceeding. By exhibiting no hurry, and appearing to think it\r\nnothing unusual or in any way strange, the female herself will cease to\r\nthink it so, and will not be flurried or shocked.\r\n\r\nThe hand must be passed under the female's right thigh, her knees being\r\nelevated. She should, of course, lie on her back, and as near to the\r\nedge of the bed as convenient. Not the slightest exposure is necessary,\r\nnor allowable under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe fore-finger being introduced, _ballotment_ may be practised, to\r\nascertain if pregnancy really exists; and if the evidence from this\r\nsource is not sufficient, auscultation must be resorted to. After\r\nbeing satisfied on this point, the mouth of the womb must be carefully\r\nexamined, and its degree of dilatation noticed. If the female has\r\npains, their character and frequency must also be noticed, and the\r\neffects they produce on the parts. It will generally be possible by\r\nthese means, to discover how far the labor has progressed, and even\r\nto form an opinion how long it is likely to last. The general form of\r\nthe parts and their size, should also be noticed; particularly of the\r\npelvis, so that any deformity or deficiency may be discovered. And\r\nlastly, the _presentation_ should be ascertained, if possible, so that\r\nit may be known in time whether nature will be sufficient herself or\r\nwill require helping. The _position_ need not be cared for at present,\r\nbecause it is of little consequence when the presentation is favorable.\r\n\r\nThe time required to make the examination need not be long, and should\r\nalways be as short as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile conversing with the patient, much useful information may be\r\ngained. The general state of her health, the nature of her pains, and\r\nthe time they first commenced, should all be known; and if she has\r\nhad children before, it will be highly useful to know what kind of a\r\nlabor she had; whether it was long or short, easy or difficult, and\r\nparticularly if attended with any accident likely to occur again.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that great caution is needed in these\r\ncases, many eminent men having been deceived as to the patient's\r\ncondition, as already stated in our chapter on the signs of pregnancy.\r\nAnd many times the doctor has been summoned under the supposition that\r\nlabor had begun, while it was yet far off. The pains may be false ones,\r\nsuch as frequently occur towards the end of pregnancy, and may all\r\npass away. These false pains, however, can usually be distinguished,\r\nbeing continuous and irregular, while the true ones intermit with\r\nperiods of almost perfect ease, and are tolerably regular. The false\r\npains are also felt in various parts, while the true ones are chiefly\r\nfixed in the uterus and vagina. Sometimes, however, the difficulty\r\nin distinguishing them is very great, and the accoucheur has often\r\nwaited for several hours and even days; the labor meanwhile making\r\nno progress; and eventually all has passed off, and the patient has\r\nrisen again from her bed. I know one case, where a gentleman attended\r\nnearly _three days_, at the end of which time the patient _rose and\r\nwalked down stairs_. She was not put to bed till _six weeks after_.\r\nI can scarcely think, however, that these mistakes can happen very\r\nfrequently, if the examination be properly conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE DELIVERY.\r\n\r\nIf it appears from the examination that labor has really commenced, or\r\nis about to do so, everything should be at once prepared. All useless\r\npersons should leave the room, and also those who would be likely to\r\nalarm or grieve the patient by uttering cries, or exhibiting fear; but\r\nno objection should be made to any one being present whom she wishes\r\nto see, unless they cannot be depended upon. Thus some females always\r\nwish to have their husbands with them, but others do not, though they\r\nare averse to saying so. In these cases the accoucheur, if he be\r\nan attentive observer, will soon see what is really desired by his\r\npatient, and will manage matters accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the female should be perfectly loose, consisting of a\r\nwrapper or night-gown, but sufficiently complete and warm to allow\r\nof her getting up to walk in the chamber, if she desires it, as some\r\ndo. No corsets, garters, or other tight bandages, however, should be\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nThe bed should be prepared by placing the mattress on the top, or by\r\nremoving all from it; and then placing a thick layer of blankets or\r\nquilts, with a folded sheet over them. This is to provide a firm level\r\nsurface, in which the body will not sink, and also to prevent the\r\nfluids soaking through. It is an excellent plan, if the material can\r\nbe obtained, to place a thin oil-skin or India-rubber cloth under the\r\nfolded sheets, as this keeps all perfectly dry underneath. Some persons\r\nalso place another folded sheet, or a cushion, under the pelvis, to\r\nkeep it elevated; but this is not necessary, unless the bed sinks in\r\nvery much. It is also advisable to leave a foot-board or other firm\r\nbody, against which the female can press her feet when bearing down;\r\nand a long towel folded lengthways should be passed under the back, so\r\nthat it can be raised up by a person lifting at each end. This will\r\noften be found a better mode of _pressing the back_, which nearly all\r\npatients call for, than by merely forcing the hand against it, which is\r\nboth tiresome and insufficient. Another towel may also be firmly fixed\r\nto the bottom of the bed, so that she can _pull_ by it, at the same\r\ntime that she pushes with her feet.\r\n\r\nSome persons are confined on a cot, but this is not a very good\r\narrangement, because it sinks in too much in the middle, and is not\r\nsufficiently large and firm. It is advantageous in one respect,\r\nhowever, as it can be placed by the side of the bed, into which the\r\npatient can be lifted when all is over, and be comparatively dry and\r\ncomfortable. This is the most frequent plan in France. If the bed be\r\nproperly arranged however, the under sheet can be withdrawn, and clean\r\nwarm napkins then passed under the body, which will be equally as good.\r\nThe covering should consist of a sheet, with blanket or coverlid,\r\naccording to temperature, and should, of course, never be removed,\r\nexcept under peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe chamber itself should be as quiet as possible, _well ventilated_,\r\nand not too warm. Nothing distresses the patient more than a close, hot\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe accoucheur need not, of course, be present while these arrangements\r\nare being made; and when he retires he should suggest to the nurse that\r\nthe female may attend to the bowels and bladder during his absence.\r\nThis precaution may both facilitate the labor, and prevent much future\r\nannoyance. It would even be advisable to administer an injection if\r\nnecessary, of thin starch and a little castor oil, rather than leave\r\nthe bowels unmoved.\r\n\r\nIn regard to nourishment, nothing is needed or proper in the shape of\r\nsolid food; because all the energies of the system are concentrated\r\nin the uterus, and as digestion cannot therefore go on, it would only\r\nbe an evil. If the labor is much protracted however, some broth or\r\nsoup may be taken, or a little milk. As a general rule, no spirituous\r\nliquors or stimulating drinks of any kind should be taken; because they\r\nimpart no real strength, and may produce inflammation, or congestion on\r\nthe brain. Some females always prefer tea to drink, others lemonade,\r\ntoast water, gruel, or barley water, and others again simple cold\r\nwater, which is perhaps the best of all. In cases of great exhaustion\r\nit is sometimes advisable, and even necessary, to give a little wine,\r\nor brandy and water, but it should always be cautiously administered.\r\n\r\nIn some parts it is customary for the female to lie on her side during\r\ndelivery, with a pillow between the knees; some even choose this mode,\r\nand others will desire to stand, or place themselves on their knees.\r\nThe most frequent position however, and certainly the most convenient,\r\nis on the back, though it may often be changed with advantage under\r\npeculiar circumstances. In the early stages of labor she can lie, or\r\nmove about, as she chooses, or even rise if more agreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENDANCE AFTER THE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE, AND DURING THE DELIVERY.\r\n\r\nWhen everything is arranged the assistant should take his seat on the\r\nright hand of his patient and repeat the examination. If the head\r\npresents, he need not concern himself much further at present, but\r\nif it be any other part, he should prepare at once to change it, or\r\nassist, as the case may be. At this second examination the parties\r\npresent, and the female herself are usually anxious to know if the\r\nchild is _coming right_, and how long the labor is likely to last. The\r\nanswer to these inquiries should be guarded and circumspect in regard\r\nto the duration, because of its uncertainty, but if the presentation\r\nis right, it is well to say so at once, because this gives great\r\ncomfort and encouragement. If it be unfortunately wrong, it is best not\r\nto say so abruptly, but remark that it is rather obscure, or cannot\r\nyet be fully distinguished, and so keep up the spirits of the female\r\nwhile you await the proper time, or make the necessary arrangements,\r\nto interfere; and then tell her there is a little difficulty which\r\nrequires to be righted, but which will not be serious, nor cause much\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nIf the labor steadily progresses it is necessary to remain with the\r\nfemale and attend to it; but if it be delayed, and everything remains\r\nnatural, she may be left for a time with advantage. When the second\r\nstage is fairly commenced however, and especially after the membranes\r\nare broken, the attention should be unremitting. The state of the parts\r\nshould be ascertained frequently, so that the actual progress may be\r\nknown, and any necessary assistance rendered. The state of the bladder\r\nespecially should be observed, and if it be full and the female unable\r\nto urinate, the catheter should be passed. Neglect of this precaution\r\nmay lead to serious accidents. While making the examinations, the hand\r\nshould be introduced with great care, so as not to bruise or lacerate\r\nthe parts, and it should not remain longer than absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nMany females exhaust themselves unnecessarily by bearing down, and\r\nstraining, with great force, from the very commencement of labor,\r\nunder the mistaken idea that it is necessary to do so, or will assist.\r\nThey should be told not to do so however, till after the membranes are\r\nbroken, and not even then unless the neck of the womb begins to dilate.\r\nThey should also be told not to make any effort except _during a pain_,\r\nas it will not assist at any other time.\r\n\r\nNo attempt should be made, under ordinary circumstances, to rupture the\r\nmembranes, or dilate the mouth of the womb, even though nature may be\r\nslow in doing so. Patience must be practised, both by the female and by\r\nher assistant, and sometimes it is severely tried.\r\n\r\nWhen the waters have escaped, and the orifice is opened, an examination\r\nmust be made, to discover whether the cord has descended, or either of\r\nthe arms, as is sometimes the case, and if so, they must be returned if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAs the head descends to the bottom of the pelvis it compresses the\r\nrectum, and produces a feeling as if the bowels must be moved, or even\r\ncauses them to be so. This is apt to distress the female, and make her\r\nwish to rise, which cannot be permitted. If anything of the kind occurs\r\nno notice should be taken of it, or she may even be assured she is\r\nmistaken, while a clean napkin may be interposed. This, as Dr. Chailly\r\nobserves, will soothe her delicacy. Such an accident is very apt to\r\noccur towards the end of the labor.\r\n\r\nWhen the head has rotated, and presents at the external opening, or\r\nvulva, and begins to distend it, the greatest care is required. This\r\nis a critical period, during which the accoucheur can render more real\r\nassistance than at almost any other. There is danger at this time, as\r\nformerly explained, of the head passing through too quickly, before\r\nthe parts are sufficiently relaxed, and so causing them to rupture.\r\nThis is particularly the case with the perineum, against which the head\r\npresses with great force. It is necessary therefore to _support the\r\nperineum_, as it is termed, to prevent this accident. This is done by\r\npassing the right arm under the patient's right thigh, and placing the\r\npalm of the hand flat against the perineum, with the thumb encircling\r\none side of the vulva, and the forefinger the other. The hand is then\r\ngently, but firmly, pressed against the part during every pain, so as\r\nto prevent the head passing too quickly, and also to _elevate it_, and\r\nthus relieve the perineum of part of the strain, and throw the occiput\r\nunder the pubes.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners also pass the left hand over the thigh, at the same\r\ntime, and grasp the back of the head with it, thus holding the head as\r\nit were between the two hands, so as to direct it at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe manner of doing this is represented in plate XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXXIX.\r\n\r\n  The manner of supporting the perineum, during the passage of the head.\r\n\r\n  The right hand is placed underneath, so as to push the head gently\r\n  back, when it presses on the perineum too forcibly, before it is\r\n  dilated; and also to elevate it towards the pubes.\r\n\r\n  The left hand is seen above, grasping the top of the head, to assist.\r\n  This may be done or not, according to the necessities of the case, or\r\n  the custom of the assistant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXIX.\r\n\r\nThe manner of supporting the perineum, during the passage of the\r\nhead.]\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to request the female at this time to moderate her\r\nefforts, and not bear down too strongly. If however she be too excited,\r\nand eager to do so, more care must be used, and the head pressed back\r\nstill more forcibly, till the parts are fully relaxed. For want of\r\nthese precautions there is often serious lacerations of the perineum\r\nand vulva, particularly in first labors, and when the parts are\r\nunusually rigid. If proper care be bestowed however, these accidents\r\nought to occur but seldom, even in the worst cases, and nothing can\r\nbe more hurtful to the reputation of an accoucheur than for them to\r\nhappen. Sometimes it is necessary to support the perineum for hours,\r\nand to bestow constant attention the whole time. It is often useful\r\nto keep applying a little simple ointment, or lard, in the intervals\r\nof the pains, mixed with the extract of Belladonna, which will soften\r\nand relax the parts. Dr. Lee also advises the application of a sponge,\r\ndipped in warm water, and which would probably do much good in many\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIt will of course be understood that the pressure only needs to be\r\nmade _during the pains_; when the head draws back the ointment or warm\r\nsponge may be applied. The knees of the female should be held up by\r\nsome one, if she bears down too much, so as to prevent her from doing\r\nso too powerfully.\r\n\r\nWhen it is felt that the parts are fully relaxed, and sufficiently\r\ndistended, the head is left at liberty, during a strong pain, and it\r\nimmediately passes the outer ring, or is born.\r\n\r\nIt should then be held up, towards the pubes, and the mucus should be\r\ncleaned from the mouth with one of the fingers, so that the child may\r\nbreathe. A careful examination should also be made round the neck,\r\nto see if the umbilical cord is around it. If it be so, but is not\r\ntight, it may be left alone, or pulled a little over one shoulder, or\r\neven passed clean over the head, if it can be _easily_ drawn out long\r\nenough. When it is very tight, and cannot be eased, it must be cut\r\nthrough, or it will strangle the child.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the shoulders follow immediately after the head, the\r\nuterus resting only a few moments; but if they do not the head may\r\nbe _slightly_ drawn upon, or the fore-finger of the right hand may\r\nbe linked under the arm, and a _little_ force employed, though very\r\ncarefully. It is better however to wait even two or three minutes, and\r\nonly resort to these means when there is evidently a partial suspension\r\nof the natural efforts. Sometimes also the contractions may be brought\r\non again by merely pressing the hand over the fundus of the uterus, and\r\nthis should therefore be tried first. In all cases it being better to\r\nlet the uterus expel the child than to bring it away by manual force.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the shoulders the perineum needs as much care as\r\nduring the passage of the head, and must be supported in the same way.\r\nIndeed some authors are of opinion that most cases of laceration are\r\ncaused by the shoulders.\r\n\r\nAfter the shoulders are expelled the limbs and body speedily follow.\r\nThe child should be received in the hands of the accoucheur, and laid\r\non its side, at a little distance from the vulva, so that it may not\r\nbe suffocated by the discharged fluids. He should then take a strong\r\nligature and pass it _twice_ round the umbilical cord, about two inches\r\nfrom the navel, and also at about four inches, and then cut the cord\r\nthrough, between the two bands, with a pair of sharp scissors. The\r\nchild may then be handed to the nurse.\r\n\r\nThe tying of the cord is by some deemed unnecessary, and in most cases\r\nprobably is so, but as children have been known to bleed to death,\r\nwhen it was not done, it should never be neglected. Some practitioners\r\nonly tie it once, leaving that part open which is still attached to\r\nthe placenta, and they suppose this is advantageous, inasmuch as it\r\npartly empties the placenta of its blood, and so helps to detach it.\r\nThere is little or no fear, as some suppose, that this bleeding can be\r\nextensive enough to hurt the female, or second child if there be one,\r\nand even if it were likely to be so it could soon be stopped; it has\r\nthe inconvenience however of soiling the bed more, and this is probably\r\none great reason why the second ligature is applied, which certainly is\r\nnot _necessary_.\r\n\r\nIn my directions I have said that the cord may be tied about two inches\r\nfrom the abdomen, and this will be sufficient if the child breathes;\r\nbut if not it should be left about four inches long, so as to give room\r\nto cut it again, which is occasionally needed, as will be seen further\r\non. The knot should be drawn very tight, and great care must be taken\r\nnever to tie it so near as to pinch the skin of the abdomen, which\r\npasses a little distance up it. A small portion of the intestine will\r\nenter the cord sometimes, and swell it out for an inch or more; this\r\nmust be pressed back with the thumb and finger, and carefully avoided\r\nby the ligature. Some practitioners cut the cord first and tie it\r\nafter, but I think the other plan is decidedly the safest and the best.\r\n\r\nAfter this is accomplished the accoucheur should place his hand again\r\nover the fundus of the uterus, to discover whether it contracts, and\r\nalso to judge whether there be another fœtus. If the womb is felt\r\ndrawn up into _a hard round ball_, in the middle of the abdomen, all is\r\nright, and no apprehension need be felt; but if it remains unaltered in\r\nsize, and is soft, _flooding_ is to be feared, and the hand should be\r\nfirmly pressed, or kneaded, over the fundus, to bring on contraction.\r\n\r\nIf there be another fœtus, the womb will remain much the same as before\r\nlabor, and the child may also be felt. It is better however to make\r\nan examination internally, and then, in most cases, the membranes and\r\npresenting part of the second fœtus will be found at the upper strait.\r\nIf there be any doubt after this it is even better to carry the hand\r\na little way into the womb, than to remain in ignorance on such an\r\nimportant point. The delivery of the second fœtus usually follows close\r\nupon the first, though sometimes there will be a delay of some hours,\r\nor even days. And in general there is little or no difficulty with the\r\nsecond, owing to the parts having been already prepared; but the longer\r\nit is delayed the less easy it becomes.\r\n\r\nImmediately the birth is fully effected the female feels, as most of\r\nthem express it, _in heaven_; there is an almost instantaneous change,\r\nfrom the most agonizing pain to a state of perfect ease. She ceases\r\nher cries, and falls into a quiet and pleasing languor, strikingly at\r\nvariance with the state of intense excitement she was in but a few\r\nmoments before. This repose however, does not last long; the Placenta\r\nyet remains, and a new effort is required to expel that.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY OF THE AFTER BIRTH, OR PLACENTA AND MEMBRANES.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Fœtus the Placenta is fast to the walls of the Womb, and can\r\nonly become separated from them by the contraction of their substance,\r\nwhich usually commences soon after the birth of the child, and is\r\nindicated by new pains, and a slight discharge of blood. In about a\r\nquarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, the accoucheur should enquire\r\nof the patient whether she has felt any of these pains, and he should\r\nalso examine whether the Placenta has reached the mouth of the Womb, or\r\nVagina, so that he may remove it. If the pains have not yet come on,\r\nand the Placenta is not in the passage, he should press one hand on\r\nthe fundus of the Womb, to promote its contraction still further, and\r\nthen gently draw upon the cord with the other, holding it as high up as\r\npossible, either by a piece of linen around it, or by looping it around\r\nthe finger. It should be pulled very gently, but steadily, downwards\r\nand backwards. If it be snatched, or drawn too hard, it may break,\r\nand cause great trouble; or it may _pull down the Womb_, and either\r\ninvert it or bring on falling of the Womb afterwards. The hand placed\r\nover the fundus can detect this accident, and if the uterus be felt to\r\n_sink down_ the cord must not be drawn upon any longer. Pulling away\r\nthe Placenta too soon, and with rudeness, has often led to deplorable\r\naccidents. In nearly every case it will gradually separate itself, and\r\nbe delivered in about half an hour, and should only be assisted by\r\n_slight_ drawing on the cord, and by pressing the fundus.\r\n\r\nWhen the Placenta is completely detached there is seldom any difficulty\r\nin its passing the neck of the Womb, and down the Vagina, but it\r\nusually requires to be drawn through the external opening by the hand.\r\nIn doing this the membranes may be twisted round the cord, so as to\r\nwind them altogether, and strengthen the cord.\r\n\r\nIn case the separation does not take place we must wait, and continue\r\nthe slight strain on the cord and the friction over the fundus. It is\r\nnot reckoned safe however, by most authors, to wait more than an hour;\r\nand if there is no sign of its coming by that time artificial delivery\r\nis resorted to. This is accomplished by carrying the hand carefully\r\nup into the Womb, and separating the Placenta from its walls with the\r\nfingers, and then bringing it down at once.\r\n\r\nWhen the afterbirth has passed the Vulva, a careful examination should\r\nbe made of it, to see that no part is left behind; and for still\r\ngreater security it is advisable to explore the Vagina thoroughly, so\r\nthat any detached portion may be removed. The membranes are very apt to\r\nbecome broken, and fragments of them left, which though ever so small\r\nmay cause trouble. The finger should also be passed into the mouth of\r\nthe Womb, so as to clear it; for sometimes a large clot of blood, or a\r\npiece of the membranes, will remain and keep it open, and thus cause\r\nsevere flooding.\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered, by those who have bestowed attention on the\r\nsubject, that assistance should always be rendered, if the afterbirth\r\ndoes not come very soon. There is danger, if it be left too long, of\r\nthe mouth of the Womb contracting and retaining it; in which case it\r\nbecomes absolutely necessary to abstract it, but exceedingly difficult,\r\nand even dangerous, to do so. Dr. Lee says it should never be left\r\nmore than _an hour_ at most, and that it is best never to delay\r\nremoving it even so long as that.\r\n\r\nWhen left purposely, for observation, it is found to be expelled\r\nspontaneously, and soon, only in a few cases; usually it remains\r\nseveral hours, and most frequently it requires to be removed by hand.\r\nNo doubt it is _natural_ for it to be expelled unaided, but it must be\r\nborne in mind that our females are usually too weak, and deficient in\r\nenergy, to perform any unusual natural function without assistance. The\r\naccoucheur must use great caution, so as neither to intrude his help\r\nwhen not required, nor yet to refuse it when really needed; and above\r\nall he must not substitute _violence_ for _skill_.\r\n\r\nWhen the afterbirth is brought away, a bandage should be passed round\r\nthe body of the female, made of soft linen, twelve or fourteen inches\r\nwide. It should be drawn moderately tight, and fastened securely. If it\r\npass round twice it will be all the better, and it should be drawn down\r\nas near the pubes as possible. I know many ladies who prefer the India\r\nRubber bands, recently invented, as they press more equally and firmly,\r\nand are put on with less trouble, being all in one piece and drawn over\r\nthe feet and limbs.\r\n\r\nSome accoucheurs put on the wrapper immediately the child is born,\r\nbefore the afterbirth passes away; but I think this is not the best\r\nplan. When properly adjusted, the supporting band gives great comfort\r\nto the female, and is very useful.\r\n\r\nSome ladies provide a curious kind of _corset_ to put on, invented for\r\nthe purpose, which however, as a celebrated author recently remarked,\r\n\"Are usually stiff and unyielding, like the prejudices of their\r\npatrons, and often prove injurious.\" None of them are equal to the\r\nsimple contrivances above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTIONS TO THE FEMALE AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THE AFTERBIRTH.\r\n\r\nWhen the afterbirth is removed the patient should be left to repose\r\nherself for about a quarter of an hour, during which time most of the\r\nblood escapes, and then she must be made as comfortable as possible.\r\nIn France, and with many persons here, it is customary to cleanse the\r\npatient with a sponge dipped in warm water, pass a clean warm sheet\r\nunder her, and then put on clean linen, after which she is lifted into\r\nthe clean bed, previously well warmed; the accoucheur himself carrying\r\nher there. Most frequently however, the sponging is dispensed with\r\ntill some time after, and also the changing of beds--the under sheet\r\nmerely being withdrawn, and a warm dry one passed in its place, while\r\nthe female's limbs are gently wiped. In either case the female should\r\nbe disturbed as little as possible, particularly if there be danger\r\nof flooding, and she should be carefully guarded from cold. When the\r\nsoiled and wet clothes are removed, as completely as possible, warm\r\nnapkins should be placed under the Pelvis and between the limbs, to\r\nsoak up the discharge, and they should be carefully changed as often\r\nas needed, without uncovering the patient. If she be disposed to sleep\r\nhowever, and is much exhausted, these attentions need not be pressed\r\ntoo much till she is recovered a little.\r\n\r\nMany persons here have a dread of using the sponge immediately, and\r\nof being carried to another bed; but there is no danger from either\r\npractice, in ordinary cases, when carefully performed; and it is so\r\nproductive of _comfort_, that I never knew one but what was pleased\r\nwith and benefitted by it, and desirous of its being done in their\r\nsubsequent labors.\r\n\r\nSome females will even rise and take a _cold bath_, or be wrapped\r\nin a _wet sheet_, not only without evil effect but with _positive\r\nadvantage_. I would not advise any one to do this however,\r\n_particularly if they are the least timid at it_, _or doubtful of its\r\npropriety_. Without the mental stimulus of _faith_ and _hope_ it may be\r\nhazardous. It shows however, that many of the popular notions, as to\r\nthe requirements and susceptibilities of females, in this state, are\r\nentirely unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe patient may either experience great comfort after being thus\r\nattended to, or she may complain very much. Some will even be attacked\r\nwith a kind of chill. Their teeth will chatter, and their hands and\r\nfeet grow quite cold. This however usually passes off, and she falls\r\nasleep. The accoucheur ought to remain for an hour or two, even though\r\nshe sleeps soundly, and appears quite well, because she may become\r\nsuddenly worse, or flooding may set in with such violence as to\r\nendanger life in a few minutes, when unchecked.\r\n\r\nIf the patient desires any nourishment she may take a little simple\r\nsoup, or gruel, but nothing stimulating, unless a little wine be needed\r\nfrom extreme exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTENTIONS TO THE CHILD.\r\n\r\n_Inspection when born_.--As soon as the child is born its mouth and\r\nnose should be cleared from mucus, if that has not been done already;\r\nand if it has not breathed, means should be resorted to immediately\r\nto make it do so. Sometimes the whole head is covered with a thin\r\nmembrane, called the _caul_, or _veil_, which is most probably only a\r\nportion of the Amnion, and which may cause suffocation. I remember a\r\ncase of this kind in my own practice, in which the caul was unnoticed\r\nat first, and the child came near dying from it. Nothing could be seen,\r\nand as it bent before the finger, when pressed into the mouth, it was\r\ntotally unobserved. The nurse however, called out that the child did\r\nnot breathe, and a close examination as to the cause soon revealed why.\r\nOn passing the finger under the edge of the membrane, which was round\r\nthe neck, it came off like a cap, and the child cried immediately.\r\n\r\n_Washing the child._--The cleansing of the child may usually be safely\r\ncommitted to the nurse, or other female attendants, though some of\r\nthem have very absurd and injurious practices in this respect. Thus\r\nI have known them rub the whole body over with _whiskey_, or _raw\r\nspirits_, before washing it, which must cause great coldness from its\r\nevaporation, and also great irritation. The only thing required is\r\n_perfect cleanliness_, and this should be effected in the _quickest_\r\nand _simplest_ manner. Some very mild soap, and moderately warm water,\r\nis all that is really needed, though a little sweet oil, or fresh lard,\r\nor butter, rubbed on first, appears to facilitate the operation. The\r\ndrying should be done as quickly as possible, after all the mucus is\r\nwashed off, and with great care; the napkin being as soft as it can\r\nbe, and never _rubbed_ hard, for it takes but little force to remove\r\nthe skin. Many persons take great trouble, and are a long time over\r\nthis infantile wash without succeeding well with it. They are deceived\r\nby the tough mucus slipping under the hand, but still clinging to\r\nthe body, where they leave it even after using the napkin; it then\r\ndries on and forms a hard skin, very difficult to remove, and very\r\nirritating. This can be avoided with care, and by using the oil first,\r\nwhich appears to soften the mucus. Some persons use _flour_, or _Indian\r\nmeal_, and others _starch_, but none of these are so good as the simple\r\nmeans we have described.\r\n\r\n_Dressing the child._--After the washing and drying is completed the\r\nchild must be _dressed_, and this is a process in which comfort and\r\nutility is frequently sacrificed to mere fashion and prejudice, as\r\nit is in adults. The article next the skin should be of soft line\r\nlinen, which may be followed by others of warmer material, according\r\nto the temperature. They should all be perfectly loose in their make,\r\nand quite soft to the feel. As far as possible they should all be\r\nfastened with _strings_, rather than _pins_. These metallic points\r\nare troublesome to fix, and often injure the child, in spite of every\r\nprecaution. They are also apt to be referred to as the cause of the\r\nchild crying, and thus prevents other causes being sought for, which\r\nfrequently exist.\r\n\r\nSome people put a thick flannel cap on the head, over a linen one, but\r\nothers leave this part altogether uncovered, which I think is the best\r\nplan. At most there should only be the linen covering; the head being\r\nbetter rather cool than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe dressing of the cord is the next duty, and this is done by taking\r\nseveral pieces of soft linen, oiled a little, and cutting a small round\r\nhole in the middle of each, through which the cord is passed. The\r\nlinen then lies flat on the abdomen of the child, and the cord on the\r\ntop of that, the holes being just large enough for it to pass easily\r\nthrough. Five or six pieces are usually put on, but very frequently\r\nonly one is used, and is found quite sufficient. It should be very\r\nfine, and soft. When this is done another layer is laid over the cord,\r\nand then a bandage of soft linen, about four or five inches wide, is\r\npassed two or three times over it, and round the body. This completes\r\nthe dressing, and the child may now be wrapped up warmly and laid down\r\nto sleep--remembering, as Dr. Chailly remarks, that if it be laid on a\r\nchair, or sofa, it may be accidentally sat upon and killed, an accident\r\nwhich has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAPPEN.\r\n\r\nBefore these dressings are needed however, there are frequently\r\nother things of more importance to be attended to. If the labor has\r\nbeen long, or the presentation unfavorable, the child may be born\r\n_apoplectic_, from the pressure it has received. The face will be\r\npuffed up, and of a blue color; the body will be swollen, and the limbs\r\nwithout motion, while the pulsation will scarcely be felt, either over\r\nthe child's heart or in the cord. It will feel warm, and the limbs will\r\nbe quite flexible, but still there will be no signs of life. In this\r\ncase it should be exposed naked to the cool air, and even blown upon;\r\nand if that does not resuscitate it the cord may be cut through below\r\nthe ligature, so as to let out two or three tea-spoonfuls of blood.\r\nAfter this it generally revives, and begins to move, while its face\r\nassumes a natural color, and the swelling goes down. The mouth and\r\nthroat should also be carefully cleaned with a quill feather, of all\r\nmucus.\r\n\r\nA more frequent accident is _Asphyxia_, or want of breathing, in which\r\ncase the surface of the body is cold and pale, and no breath whatever\r\nis drawn, though the heart beats quite naturally. Very weak children,\r\nor those born before their time, are most likely to become asphyxiated,\r\nor those delivered by instruments. The first thing to be done is to\r\ncarry the child to the open window, if it be not exceedingly cold, and\r\nexpose its head and chest to the air, while the rest of the body is\r\nwrapped up warm. This will often make it gasp, but if it does not a\r\nlittle cold water may be dashed on its face and chest, and the throat\r\nmay be tickled with a feather. The breech may also be smartly slapped,\r\nand the chest well rubbed with the cold hand. When it begins to breathe\r\na little it may be put into a warm bath up to the middle, and a warm\r\ninjection may be given to it. In most cases these means will speedily\r\nbring it round, but if they do not the attendant should place his mouth\r\nclose over that of the child and breathe into it, so as to fill the\r\nlungs, and then press down the chest to empty them again, repeating\r\nthe process several times. This may be called artificial breathing,\r\nand if it succeed once only there is a probability of its effecting\r\nthe desired object. The breath however, must not be blown in too hard,\r\nor it may injure the child's lungs, nor too rapidly. Sometimes a tube\r\nis used, which is passed down into the throat; but it is troublesome,\r\nand not much better than the mouth, if any at all. These efforts may\r\nbe repeated twenty or thirty times if necessary, or even more. In some\r\ncases it is requisite to continue using some, or all of these means,\r\nfor an hour or two without intermission, before the child begins to\r\nbreathe freely. I knew an instance even, where the nurse continued to\r\ndo so for _five hours_, and at last fully recovered the child, though\r\nall present, including the doctor, had given it up. She said she did\r\nnot despair while it continued _warm_, though it was doubtful whether\r\nthe heart beat or not. This may show that the attempt should not be\r\nabandoned too soon.\r\n\r\nIn cases of asphyxia no blood should be lost at all, but on the\r\ncontrary the cord should be carefully examined to see if it is tied\r\nfast; the bleeding from it frequently aggravating the evil.\r\n\r\n_Congenital weakness._--Some children are born extremely weak, and\r\nremain constantly debilitated and cold. This is very apt to be the\r\ncase when they are born before the full term, or when the mother is\r\ndiseased. They should be carefully wrapped in cotton, or very soft\r\nflannel, and kept warm by bottles of warm water. Many instances are on\r\nrecord of these weak children becoming afterwards extremely robust, so\r\nthat they need not be regarded with unmixed apprehension, nor neglected\r\nfrom a supposition that they must die.\r\n\r\n_The child may be deformed._--The accoucheur should also carefully\r\nexamine the child, to see if it be deformed in any way, or has met with\r\nany accident, because in some of these cases assistance is required\r\nimmediately, and may be rendered at once.\r\n\r\n_The child's capability of endurance._--The capability of the new-born\r\ninfant to endure extremes of cold is almost as great as that of its\r\nmother, and sometimes even it is benefitted by them. With many persons\r\nit is customary to plunge it in cold water, immediately when born; and\r\nin Russia, we are told, it is even _rolled in the snow_. In some cases\r\nthese extremes may be beneficial, but in others I have no doubt they\r\nprove fatal. A medium course is best, in most instances, leaving the\r\nextreme to be resorted to when we wish a sudden stimulus.\r\n\r\nWhen all these matters are carefully attended to, and both mother and\r\nchild have remained for an hour or two without any unpleasant symptom,\r\nthey may be left to the care of the ordinary attendants, giving them\r\nstrict orders to send for proper assistance _immediately_, if anything\r\nunusual transpires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT ATTENTIONS TO MOTHER AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n_The Bladder._--One of the most important points to attend to is the\r\nurine. A few hours after the delivery is fully effected, unless the\r\nfemale is reposing, she should be asked whether she has any desire to\r\nurinate; and, if she has, the convenience should be at once afforded\r\nto do so. There is always more or less danger of retention of urine,\r\nfrom the pressure that has been exerted on the bladder; and if it be\r\nallowed to continue too long its removal becomes exceedingly difficult.\r\nIf on making the attempt the urine does not flow, the catheter must be\r\nused, and the sooner the better. The pain arising from retention of the\r\nurine has often been supposed to arise from inflammation of the womb,\r\nor bowels--neither patient nor physician knowing its real source, till\r\nthe passage by the catheter gave relief. There have even been instances\r\nof females dying, merely from an overcharged bladder, while their\r\nattendants were industriously treating them for uterine inflammation.\r\nThis accident therefore, should always be suspected, and a very little\r\nattention will prevent any mistake in regard to it. When allowed to\r\nbecome too full the swollen bladder may be felt, just above the pubes,\r\nhard and tender, so that the least pressure upon it causes great pain.\r\nIf not relieved it will at last burst.\r\n\r\n_The Bowels._--If the bowels are not opened naturally, it will be well,\r\nthe following day, to administer an injection of thin starch and water,\r\nor to prescribe a small dose of castor oil, or a seidlitz powder. This\r\nshould also be repeated for two or three days, till the natural power\r\nis restored.\r\n\r\n_The Food._--But little solid food should be taken, and nothing\r\nstimulating. Gruel, milk, toast and water, Indian meal, light puddings,\r\nor broth, should be the chief articles for some time. Roast apples are\r\nalso very good, being pleasant and relaxing. For refreshing drinks, if\r\nthere be any fever, lemonade or tamarind tea may be taken.\r\n\r\n_The After Pains._--After the expulsion of the after-birth most females\r\nexperience, more or less, severe pains, almost like those of labor,\r\narising apparently from the further contraction of the uterine walls\r\nto expel the coagulated blood. These pains are seldom or never felt in\r\nfirst labors, but afterwards they are often most acute. I have known\r\nmany patients suffer _much more_ from them than they did during labor.\r\nThey sometimes last only a few hours, or a day, and sometimes even\r\nextend to six or eight days. Nothing that we know of can prevent them,\r\nthough many means are known of mitigating their severity. If there\r\nbe no tendency to flooding, a large poultice may be placed over the\r\nabdomen, or it may be fomented, or covered with cloths wrung out in hot\r\nwater. An injection may also be used, either in the Vagina or Rectum,\r\nconsisting of warm thin starch, with about twenty drops of laudanum;\r\nor either of the following recipes may be used internally:--_Pills of\r\nGum Camphor_, two, about the size of ordinary pills, to be repeated,\r\nif necessary, in an hour.--Or, _Syrup of Poppies_, two drachms;\r\n_Mucilage of Gum Arabic_, two ounces; and _Solution of Sulphate of\r\nMorphia_, ten drops; to be made into a mixture, _one-half_ of which may\r\nbe taken at first, and the remainder in _two hours_, if the patient is\r\nnot relieved. This seldom fails.--It is necessary to bear in mind that\r\nthe pains arising from _inflammation_ have been mistaken for ordinary\r\nafter-pains, and serious consequences have resulted from the error. The\r\nafter-pains however, are concentrated, and _intermittent_, while the\r\nsensations from inflammation are more diffused and constant, and are\r\nalso usually attended by fever.\r\n\r\n_The Lochial Discharge._--From the time of delivery until the uterus\r\nhas returned to its ordinary condition, there is poured from it a\r\ndischarge, at first like blood, and afterwards thin and light colored,\r\ncalled the _Lochia_. The duration of this discharge varies from one\r\nweek to a month, and its quantity from one ounce to six or eight\r\nounces, daily. It gradually diminishes however, and frequently stops\r\nfor a few days altogether. In women who do not nurse it is both more\r\nabundant, and lasts longer, than in those who do. The bloody color\r\nusually disappears after the first or second day, though sometimes it\r\nwill show itself again, even when the discharge has nearly ceased,\r\nparticularly if the female exert herself too soon.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this discharge is essential to health, and great\r\nattention should therefore be bestowed on the patient, if it be too\r\nsmall, or cease too soon, or too suddenly. In most cases it ceases\r\nnaturally during the _milk fever_, and of course its disappearance then\r\nneed not excite alarm. Sometimes also, it does not attain its full\r\nquantity till some days after its commencement. If however, it remains\r\nsmall past the _third_ day, or does not appear when the milk fever\r\nis over, means should be taken for increasing it. The best means for\r\nthis purpose are _warm poultices_ and _fomentations_ over the abdomen,\r\nand injections in the rectum of simple warm water. Some practitioners\r\nadvise _two drachms of powdered Camphor_ to be sprinkled on each\r\npoultice, and probably it is an excellent addition. Occasionally the\r\nlochia is very offensive, and in that case a simple cleansing injection\r\nmay be frequently used of thin starch, or Chammomile tea.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of the Lochia in fact, even in ordinary\r\ncases, the female will be all the more comfortable, and better, for\r\nan occasional injection, and frequent washing. This is very much\r\nneglected, though it never ought to be so. The only care required is\r\nnot to expose her to cold, which is quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_The Milk Fever._--About the second or third day there usually\r\ncommences a peculiar temporary excitement in the system, called\r\nthe _milk fever_, which requires to be described because it may be\r\nconfounded with something more serious. It is generally ushered in by\r\nheadache, flushed face, and a hot dry skin; the pulse beats slowly, and\r\nthe breasts become hard, while the veins upon them appear very full. In\r\na short time however, the pulse becomes quicker, a perspiration breaks\r\nout, and the breasts become still larger and fuller, so that the female\r\ncan scarcely bring her arms to her body. These symptoms last about a\r\nday, or two days at most, and seldom become much aggravated.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the milk fever is preceded by a slight chill, or by a\r\nfurred tongue, or sick stomach, but not very frequently.\r\n\r\nThe precise causes of this temporary fever are unknown, though probably\r\nit is connected with the full establishment of the secretion of milk,\r\nand hence its name. It is seldom very severe in those who nurse, and\r\nfrequently does not appear at all. During its continuance, and for some\r\ntime after, the female must carefully avoid exposure to cold, and keep\r\nherself quiet; her diet should also be rather restricted, and light and\r\nunstimulating. An occasional seidlitz powder may also be of service, or\r\na simple injection.\r\n\r\n_Making the Bed._--It is not customary to disturb the female, for the\r\npurpose of making her bed, till the milk fever is passed; or, if that\r\ndoes not appear, till the tenth or twelfth day; and then it should be\r\ndone with care, and so as not to expose her unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n_First sitting up, and Going out._--This must of course be determined\r\nmore by the condition of the patient, and the state of the weather,\r\nthan by any rules. It may be as well to remark however, no matter how\r\nthe patient may _feel_, that the _first attempt_ should always be\r\nmade with care. Very frequently she thinks herself stronger, and more\r\ncapable, than she really is, and premature or undue exertion may do\r\ngreat injury. In most cases the female is allowed to rise within the\r\nfirst week, and sit for a short time in an arm chair; after which she\r\nbegins to walk slowly about the room. The first going out is fixed,\r\n_by fashion_, at one month. Many females however, are unfit to leave\r\nthe house till long after that time, and others should by no means be\r\nconfined to it _so long_. Of course these proceedings should depend,\r\nas already remarked, upon the patient's strength and inclinations,\r\nand upon the state of the weather, and not upon any fashionable\r\nobservances. Some females are quite able to rise, and even walk out, in\r\na few days, with benefit to themselves; and it exhibits as great a want\r\nof correct feeling, or common sense, for any one to make disparaging\r\nremarks on them for their early appearance, as it would if they were to\r\nblame the poor invalid for keeping her bed.\r\n\r\nThe apartment should be kept constantly _well ventilated_, particularly\r\nif the female is confined to it, and all soiled linen, or other sources\r\nof foul air, should be removed as quickly as possible. There is reason\r\nto believe that inattention to this, and to properly cleansing the\r\n_person_ of the female, frequently produces _child-bed fever_.\r\n\r\n_Attentions to the Child._--If the infant's bowels are not opened by\r\nthe end of the first day it should have a little sugar, or molasses\r\nand water, given to it, and if this does not succeed about half a\r\ntea-spoonful of syrup of Rhubarb may be added. This is however but\r\nseldom needed, if it be put to the breast within a few hours, as the\r\nfirst secretion of the milk possesses sufficient laxative power itself.\r\nIt should also be observed whether it has urinated, and if not it\r\nshould be placed in a warm bath immediately.\r\n\r\nSome persons prefer to let the child wait till the milk fever is\r\nestablished, before they let it nurse, but this is very improper. The\r\nearly feeding does it no good, and the purgatives it requires are\r\ninjurious. As soon as the female is sufficiently reposed, if there is\r\nnothing special to forbid it, the child should go to the breast.\r\n\r\nSometimes the child will remain sleepy and dull, and not seem to\r\nrequire food at all, for several days, and even die at last of\r\nstarvation, unless aroused. If this lethargy continues it should be\r\nput in a warm bath, and afterwards well rubbed, while a little sugar\r\nand water is poured down its throat. These attentions may be required\r\nto be repeated for some time.\r\n\r\nAbout the fourth or fifth day the portion of the cord above the knot\r\nusually separates and falls off, if it has not already done so. If\r\nthe navel is inflamed, or suppurates, a little simple ointment may be\r\nrubbed on, and it should be regularly and carefully washed. In some\r\ninfants it swells out very much, in which case a pad should be made of\r\nsoft linen, and laid upon it, over which the ordinary bandage may be\r\ndrawn. The complete healing of the part does not occur till about the\r\ntwelfth day, and the bandage must be carefully worn till then at least,\r\nand is better continued a little longer, particularly if there is any\r\nswelling, or if the child cries much, or strains.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nFrom the explanations given above of an ordinary natural labor, it\r\nwill be evident that but little manual assistance is required, either\r\nto the mother or the child, and also what really is called for is of\r\nso simple a character as to be easily rendered. It would undoubtedly\r\nbe improper, and cruel, to leave females at such times without aid\r\naltogether; but it is also equally improper and injurious to interfere\r\ntoo much. Excepting in cases of disease and deformity, or of very\r\nunfavorable presentations of the fœtus, Nature herself will nearly\r\nalways effect the delivery; and much better, in most cases, when left\r\nto herself. Numerous females and infants have been _killed_, and still\r\nmore have been grievously injured for life, by rude and uncalled for\r\nmanipulations; so that it has been a question with some accoucheurs, of\r\ngreat experience, whether as many would die, or seriously suffer, from\r\nreceiving _no assistance_, as do now from being improperly handled.\r\nWithout going so far, it is undoubtedly true that great mischief is\r\ndone in this way, which can only be prevented by both accoucheur and\r\npatient bearing in mind that _Nature herself is usually competent_,\r\nand at most only requires skillful and gentle _assistance_. Some\r\npractitioners seem to think that labor is a mere _mechanical_ process,\r\nlike the removal of a block of stone, and hence they depend altogether\r\nupon _force_; overlooking altogether the wonderful vital powers\r\ninherent in the system, which operate with such certainty, and yet so\r\nsafely; and which frequently succeed of themselves when brute force is\r\ncompletely foiled.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the assistance proper to be given, in any particular\r\nstage of labor, will be evident on inspecting the structure of those\r\nparts, of both mother and child, which are brought in connection at\r\nthe time, and by considering how their mutual relations require to\r\nbe changed and modified. If those relations are already such as are\r\nrequired, and the system retains sufficient force, nothing _can_\r\nbe done with any advantage--we must _wait_, and let Nature operate\r\nherself. Even many unfavorable conditions may be spontaneously\r\ncorrected, and it should always be a matter of consideration, when the\r\nmeans of assistance are not very obvious, whether it will not be better\r\nto rely upon the natural powers than to interfere. Great evil has\r\nresulted from teaching females that labor _cannot_ terminate, safely,\r\nwithout a great deal of assistance, which can only be rendered properly\r\nby those who possess a vast amount of skill and experience. They are\r\nthus led to think themselves totally dependent upon the accoucheur,\r\nand many of them actually seem to believe that he is as necessary to\r\ndeliver the child as a dentist is to extract a bad tooth. If they were\r\nbetter informed they would feel more confidence in their own natural\r\npowers, and would not be so unnecessarily alarmed when unforeseen\r\ndifficulties occur, or when professional aid cannot be immediately\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\nIn most cases there is more danger _after the labor is over_, from\r\n_puerperal fever_, various local inflammations and other causes, than\r\nthere was during its progress. Indeed the real danger may be said\r\nproperly to commence several days after, and the physician is really\r\nneeded then more than at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nPROTRACTED AND DIFFICULT LABORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes which may impede a labor, and increase its difficulties,\r\nare numerous, and they are of several different kinds--some depending\r\nupon the mother, and others upon the child. Some of these may be easily\r\nremoved, or modified, but others present more serious difficulty. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to enumerate and explain them separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF PROLONGED LABOR TO BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF PROLONGED LABOR.\r\n\r\nA labor is usually called protracted or difficult, if the head\r\npresents, when it is not completed in about _twenty-four hours_ from\r\nits actual commencement. There are many labors however, that last much\r\nlonger, and yet terminate quite favorably, and many that are over\r\nmuch sooner and yet are very difficult. Still, generally speaking,\r\nthe danger and difficulty increases as the time progresses, and it is\r\nseldom prolonged beyond twenty-four hours without serious inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the statistics of the Dublin Lying-in Hospital, that\r\nin _seventy-eight thousand deliveries_, one out of every _ninety-two_\r\nof the mothers died, and one out of every _eighteen_ of the children\r\nwas stillborn. Of those mothers who were in labor with first children,\r\nfrom _thirty to forty hours_, one in every _thirty-four_ died, and one\r\nchild in every _five_ was stillborn. Of those who were in labor from\r\nforty to fifty hours, one died in every _thirteen_. Of those who were\r\nin labor from fifty to sixty hours, one died in every _eleven_. And of\r\nthose who were in labor from sixty to seventy hours, one died in every\r\n_eight_, and nearly _one-half_ of the children. It is evident therefore\r\nthat, as a general rule, the danger increases with the length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCAUSES CONNECTED WITH THE MOTHER WHICH MAY IMPEDE LABOR, OR MAKE IT\r\nDIFFICULT.\r\n\r\n\r\nINERTIA, OR WANT OF SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL CONTRACTION IN THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThis is most likely to occur in delicate females, and in those who are\r\ndebilitated by disease. The contractions are very feeble, and, as the\r\nnurses say _do not tell_; the mouth of the womb dilates but slowly, and\r\nthe head descends with difficulty into the passage.\r\n\r\nIn many cases in fact the labor is so tedious, from this cause, that\r\nthe female becomes completely worn out, and finally sinks, while the\r\nchild is exposed to the greatest hazard from the delay.\r\n\r\nIt is in these cases that the patient's strength needs supporting, and\r\nthat stimulants may be useful. A little wine, or brandy and water,\r\nwill often rouse the failing energies, and bring on a series of strong\r\ncontractions that will end the labor at once.\r\n\r\nThe most usual resort however is to the drug called _Ergot_, or _Secale\r\nCornutum_, a fungus growth which is sometimes found on ears of rye.\r\nThis possesses the peculiar property of exciting the womb to contract,\r\nthe same as an emetic excites the stomach to vomit, and it seldom fails\r\nin its effect; but still there are many objections to its use. It\r\nnot unfrequently causes _delirium_, great restlessness, and anxiety,\r\nsickness, headache, and convulsions, or complete prostration, from\r\nwhich the female may be long in recovering. It is also supposed by\r\nsome to be not altogether free from danger to the child. If however\r\nno other means were known of making the womb contract, in such cases,\r\nall the probable evils should be risked, because the labor _must_ be\r\ncompleted at all hazards; but other means _are_ known, which succeed\r\neven more certainly than ergot, and without any danger. The application\r\nof _Galvanism_, explained in my \"_Neuropathy_,\" and \"_Practical\r\nFacts_,\" will almost invariably cause the womb to contract, and\r\nspeedily bring the labor to a safe termination, without the slightest\r\nrisk or inconvenience, to either mother or child. Simple friction over\r\nthe abdomen will also succeed in many cases, and gently rubbing the\r\nmouth of the womb with the finger in others. These simple means should\r\ntherefore always be used in preference to the ergot, but in case they\r\ncannot be resorted to, or fail, the drug must be administered, and I\r\nwill therefore explain the manner in which this is done. When gathered\r\nthe ergot is in large irregular lumps, and should be so kept. When\r\nwanted for use a single drachm should be finely powdered, and divided\r\ninto three parts; one of these parts to be taken first in a glass of\r\nsugar and water, and the others at intervals of ten minutes, unless the\r\neffects of the first are very powerful. It is often thrown from the\r\nstomach however even in still smaller quantities, and is then given,\r\nby some, as an injection by the rectum, in which mode it seems more\r\npowerful, so that a smaller dose is sufficient.\r\n\r\nGreat caution should always be observed in using this powerful drug,\r\nas it will sometimes act so energetically as to _burst the womb_; or\r\nexpel the child so suddenly as to lacerate the perineum and other\r\nparts. The contractions produced by it are different from the natural\r\nones, being almost constant, without any interval, and gradually\r\nincreasing in force. They usually come on in about ten or fifteen\r\nminutes after the last dose, and continue about an hour and a half.\r\nSome practitioners depend almost altogether on the ergot, in every\r\nprotracted case, and even use it to bring on _premature labor_, when\r\nthat is required. Thus M. P. Dubois was once called to a dwarf, whom he\r\ndelivered with instruments, the first time, but with great difficulty\r\nand risk. The next time she became pregnant he determined to bring on\r\npremature labor, and accordingly he administered ergot, when she was\r\nabout _eight months_ gone. This brought on natural labor, and she was\r\ndelivered without difficulty. M. Chailly says he believes it will bring\r\non uterine contraction at any time, and that he has never known it to\r\nfail. I consider however that there is always more or less risk in its\r\nuse, and I should certainly prefer any of the other means, particularly\r\n_Galvanism_.\r\n\r\nIt is of the first importance however to be certain, before using _any\r\nforcing means whatever_, that there is no _physical impediment_. If\r\nthe pelvis should be deformed or small, if the child's head should\r\nbe unusually large, or dropsical, or if the soft parts of the mother\r\nshould be undilated and rigid, the most serious consequences must ensue\r\nfrom violent uterine contractions. In like manner if the presentation\r\nbe unfavorable, particularly if it be one of the trunk, the danger\r\nis equally great. In every case the passage of the child must be\r\n_physically possible_, before it is attempted to force it away. A\r\nneglect of this rule has frequently led to fatal results. The ergot\r\nhas been given and the uterus forced to contract, while the pelvis\r\nwas too small for the child to pass through; and the consequence has\r\nbeen _rupture of the uterus_, or complete exhaustion, with death to\r\nboth mother and infant. In other cases the delivery has resulted so\r\nsuddenly, from the violence of the expulsive efforts, that the vagina\r\nand perineum have been lacerated in the most shocking manner.\r\n\r\nThe ergot is also especially dangerous to very nervous women, or to\r\nthose who are disposed to congestion, apoplexy, or inflammation.\r\n\r\nAmong the special causes which often paralyze the action of the womb,\r\nmay be mentioned a full habit of body, great distention of the uterus\r\nfrom accumulations of fluid, and extreme thickness of the membranes.\r\nIn some cases in fact, the membranes will be so strong that the most\r\nviolent contractions fail to break them, and the uterus completely\r\nexhausts itself to no purpose. It is in such cases as these, when the\r\nmouth of the womb is fully dilated, that the accoucheur should rupture\r\nthe membranes artificially. This is usually done with the finger nail\r\nby pinching them. Some practitioners however use a pointed instrument,\r\nor a sharp quill; but there is always more or less danger of injuring\r\nthe child or the mother by such means. The best time for breaking\r\nthem is during a strong pain, when they are fully distended. The mere\r\nscratching, or pushing on them will frequently suffice. I have known\r\ncases however in which they were so strong that an instrument was\r\nactually necessary to open them.\r\n\r\nThe death of the infant also seems sometimes to check uterine\r\ncontraction, though probably not from the mere circumstance of its\r\nbeing dead, but because the womb suffers from the same morbid cause\r\nwhich produced its death.\r\n\r\nAny strong moral impression may also produce the same state of things.\r\nThus in some females the womb will instantly cease its contractions,\r\nand the labor be arrested, from _fright_, or from strong repugnance\r\nto somebody, or something, in the room. Instances have been known of\r\nwomen being so alarmed on first seeing the accoucheur, or so displeased\r\nbecause he was not the one they wished, that the uterine efforts\r\nimmediately ceased, and could not be again brought on for a long time.\r\nThe presence of some person who is a subject of dislike may also\r\nhave a very prejudicial effect, and if this is known they should be\r\nimmediately removed. Dr. Merriman tells us of a female who was seized\r\nwith a fit, from which she died, simply from seeing a strange doctor\r\nenter the room.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the cause which paralyzes the action of the womb we\r\nshould endeavor, if possible, to discover and remove it. If however\r\nit be beyond our reach, the patient's strength must be supported as\r\nmuch as possible, and the simplest means of exciting the contractions\r\ntried first; if these fail the more powerful ones must be tried,\r\nalways preferring the safest. Finally, if all fail, the hand must be\r\nintroduced into the womb, the child turned, and brought away by the\r\nfeet; or the forceps must be used if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGIDITY OF THE MOUTH OF THE WOMB, VAGINA AND VULVA.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mouth of the womb or other soft parts, will not give way,\r\nbut remain obstinately rigid, so as to render the continued expulsive\r\nefforts of the womb of no avail. If this state continues too long the\r\nparts become swollen, hot, and dry, and extremely painful, so that\r\nthe slightest touch causes acute suffering. The abdomen also becomes\r\nexquisitely tender, fever sets in, with cold sweats, the head begins\r\nto wander, the features express great anxiety and suffering, and the\r\nvoice alters so that it can scarcely be recognized. These symptoms will\r\nsometimes be established, and become rapidly worse in a remarkably\r\nshort time, so that the patient will appear to pass suddenly from a\r\ncondition of comparative ease and safety to one of extreme peril and\r\nsuffering. The child also suffers in an equal degree, the continued\r\npressure upon its head having a most injurious effect. The bones\r\noverlap to a great distance, the scalp is engorged with fluid, and all\r\nits blood-vessels are ready to burst; the brain is severely compressed;\r\nthe circulation in it is suspended, and apoplexy frequently ensues.\r\nEven when one of these protracted cases eventually terminates without\r\nimmediate mischief, there is much subsequent evil to be feared. The\r\nbruised parts frequently slough away, so that fistulas are formed, and\r\nthe whole remain so permanently weak that they can never afterwards\r\nretain their places.\r\n\r\nThe most usual resort in these cases of obstinate rigidity is\r\n_blood-letting_. This frequently induces relaxation immediately,\r\nand also checks the tendency to inflammation and fever. In many\r\ncases however, if not in all, it may be dispensed with, and should\r\nalways be so if possible. Very frequently it produces as much evil\r\nas good, by alarming the patient, and by creating a debility which\r\ncannot afterwards be removed. Simple warm _fomentations_ will often\r\nmake the rigid parts give way; and so will lubricating them with\r\nsoothing ointment, or better still anointing them with the _Extract of\r\nBelladonna_. This frequently acts like a charm, and opens the rigid\r\nos tincæ in a few minutes. Injections of thin starch and laudanum are\r\nalso excellent, and may be advantageously administered before applying\r\nthe Belladonna. The _Galvanic Battery_ may also be employed, it having\r\ninduced relaxation in many cases, when all other means failed; as will\r\nbe seen by the cases quoted in \"Practical Facts.\"\r\n\r\nIf the labor really does progress though slowly, it is generally best\r\nto have patience and let it take its course. If however the patient is\r\nlikely to sink before it is completed, or if it is at a stand still,\r\nand cannot be accelerated, artificial delivery may be necessary. It is\r\nseldom however that all of the above mentioned means fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBLIQUITIES OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nSometimes the womb is so much inclined in a particular direction that\r\nits mouth does not present to the middle of the passage. Thus it may\r\nlean over so much to the right side that the mouth may open against the\r\nleft wall of the Pelvis; or it may lean to the left side, or to the\r\nfront. In all these cases the expulsion of the child may be totally\r\nprevented, because it is forced against the walls of the passage\r\ninstead of down its axis.\r\n\r\nObliquity is sometimes righted spontaneously, but more frequently it\r\nrequires the interference of art. The mode of rendering assistance is\r\nto support the womb on the side to which it falls, particularly during\r\nthe pains, so that its mouth may be directed towards the middle of the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLAPSUS UTERI.\r\n\r\nFalling of the womb may retard labor, but is not likely to make it more\r\nthan usually difficult, nor dangerous. It is requisite, however to bear\r\nin mind that the head of the child may, by this displacement, be found\r\nin the vagina, and even at the vulva, before it has passed through the\r\nmouth of the womb, because the neck itself is already in the passage.\r\nThe head may therefore be felt low down, and the accoucheur may think\r\nthe labor will soon be completed, when in reality it has scarcely\r\nbegun. In such cases it merely requires patience and _non-interference_.\r\n\r\nIn my work on _the Diseases of Women_, will be found many curious\r\ncases of pregnancy and delivery, occurring during partial or complete\r\nprolapsus uteri; and also much information regarding obliquity, and\r\nother similar derangements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLNESS OR DEFORMITY OF THE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nThese constitute by far the most serious obstacles to delivery, and are\r\nmost to be dreaded. In treating upon them it will be first necessary to\r\nexplain the chief kinds of deformities, and the cause from which they\r\narise, after which it can be shown how they interfere with the progress\r\nof labor, and how they can be best remedied.\r\n\r\nDeformities of the pelvis may either be congenital, or they may be\r\nproduced by certain diseases in after life, and also by bad physical\r\neducation. The principal causes however are two diseases, _Rachitis_,\r\nor _Rickets_, and _Malacosteon_, called also _Mollites Ossium_, or\r\nsoftening of the bones. Rachitis usually attacks children somewhere\r\nbetween nine months and two years of age, and produces a variety of\r\nwell marked symptoms; such as large head and belly, protrusion of the\r\nbreast-bone, flattening of the ribs, emaciation of the limbs, and\r\nvarious deformities of the bones. The patient may recover from the\r\ndisease, but the deformity of the bones often remains, and therefore no\r\nfemale should become pregnant, who has had rickets, till the shape and\r\ndimensions of her pelvis are known, or it may cost her life.\r\n\r\nMalacosteon or softening of the bones, may come on at any period\r\nof life, and frequently occurs without any serious constitutional\r\ndisturbance. It consists in a gradual absorption from the bones of\r\nall their solid matter, so that they become soft, and may be bent or\r\ntwisted like horn. Sometimes this state will be reached very soon, but\r\nat other times the disease progresses very slowly. The causes of it are\r\nunknown, and it is incurable. I have seen a patient who could bend the\r\nbone of her leg _nearly double_, as if it were a piece of rope.\r\n\r\nIn my work on the Diseases of Woman, I have spoken upon various other\r\ncauses which may deform the bones in young females, such as wearing\r\ncorsets, improper attitudes in sitting, and want of sufficient\r\n_unconstrained_ exertion of the body in the open air.\r\n\r\nThe deformities may be of various kinds, and may either alter the\r\ngeneral appearance and the walk, or may not be discoverable except on\r\nexamination. Sometimes the pelvis is _too large_, so that the womb and\r\nother parts are continually falling down into its cavity, but this is\r\nvery rarely seen; more frequently it is either too small, or irregular\r\nin its form.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where the irregularity in form, or diminution in size,\r\nis such as to prevent the passage of the child an operation becomes\r\nnecessary, either upon the mother or her infant, and great danger is\r\nconsequently incurred by both.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the duty of every mother, if she has the slightest\r\nsuspicion that her daughter is deformed, though it may not be apparent,\r\nto have her examined before she is allowed to marry. _Many have lost\r\ntheir lives for want of this precaution._ Severe blows or falls in\r\nearly life may also create a pelvic deformity, and this, as a possible\r\nconsequence of such accidents, should always be borne in mind. The\r\nmeans by which the form and size of the pelvis are ascertained, as\r\nbefore stated, are simple, and such as need not in any way be feared.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the varieties of deformed pelvis, as described by\r\ndifferent authors, is unnecessary, and would not be useful here. I\r\nshall therefore only refer to them generally. Sometimes the pelvis\r\nis regular enough in its form, but singularly small altogether, not\r\nlarger perhaps than that of a child eight or nine years of age. More\r\nfrequently, however one part only is small, while the others are full\r\nsized, or the different parts are not in a proper position in regard to\r\neach other. Thus sometimes the pubic bones will be flattened backward,\r\nnear to the sacrum, so as to narrow the antero posterior diameter of\r\nthe upper strait; at other times one of the sides will be flattened\r\ntowards the other, as if crushed in, and thus diminish all the\r\ndiameters; and at other times one side will sink down lower than the\r\nother, and thus effect similar changes in another way.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the description of the perfect pelvis, given in the\r\nearly part of the work, the nature of these changes will be readily\r\nunderstood, particularly if the plates given there are compared with\r\nthose given here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XL.\r\n\r\n  Represents the _standard_ form, with which the rest must be compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLI.\r\n\r\n  Represents a pelvis which resembles that of the male in its form, and\r\n  is therefore called _masculine_. It is deeper, and less capacious\r\n  altogether than the standard one. This form is occasionally met with\r\n  in females of a peculiar general conformation, and temperament,\r\n  approaching that of the other sex. It is not a sufficient deviation\r\n  from the natural form to create any great difficulty, though it may\r\n  cause delay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XL.\r\n\r\nRepresents the _standard_ form of the Pelvis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLI.\r\n\r\nMasculine Pelvis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLII.\r\n\r\n  Represents the peculiar deformity most frequently produced by\r\n  _Mollites Ossium_. The different parts are stretched out as it were,\r\n  and crushed inwards toward each other. The size of each strait is\r\n  diminished in nearly every diameter, and the whole form is very\r\n  unfavorable to delivery. This is sometimes called a _cordiform_\r\n  pelvis. Observe the difference between it and the standard one.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLIII.\r\n\r\n  This is called an _Ovate_ Pelvis. It appears as if it had been\r\n  crushed by a heavy weight, from above downward, the sacrum being\r\n  depressed below the plane of the pubes. In this case the antero\r\n  posterior diameter of the upper strait is so much lessened that the\r\n  two halves appear nearly separated, and form almost a figure of eight\r\n  (8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLII.\r\n\r\nRepresents the peculiar deformity most frequently produced by _Mollites\r\nOssium_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLIII.\r\n\r\nThis is called an _Ovate_ Pelvis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLIV.\r\n\r\n  This is another kind of deformity, in which one side is sunk down\r\n  below the other, while both are twisted as it were round the sacrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLV.\r\n\r\n  This is a section of a Pelvis to show the effect of a corroding\r\n  disease of another kind. The whole of this is such a mass of disease\r\n  and deformity as to preclude any particular description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLIV.\r\n\r\nThis is another deformity, in which one side is sunk below the other,\r\nand both twisted round the sacrum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLV.\r\n\r\nThe effect of corroding disease.]\r\n\r\nCurvature of the spine sometimes affects the pelvis, when low down, and\r\ntherefore if any female is affected with it she should not marry before\r\nbeing examined. Several diseases and lesions of the hip-joint, and of\r\nthe thigh, may also do the same, and should therefore be suspected.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of cases, deformities of the pelvis remain\r\nunknown, till the period of delivery, and all that can be then done\r\nis to combat in the best possible way the difficulties they create.\r\nIt is evident that the amount of difficulty depends entirely on the\r\ndisproportion between the head of the child, and the passage through\r\nwhich it has to be born. If the head be large and the passage small\r\nthe difficulty will be greatest, but if the head be small it may pass\r\nthrough the pelvis though under its average size. The development of\r\nthe head cannot be ascertained however, before birth, except when it is\r\nunusually large from dropsy, and it is therefore always assumed to be\r\nof an average development, and the pelvis is compared accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe kind of assistance required in these cases depends chiefly on the\r\nmeasure of the pelvic diameters, though it may be modified somewhat by\r\nother considerations.\r\n\r\nWhen the smallest diameter of the pelvis measures from _three inches\r\nand a half to three inches_, it is customary to leave the expulsion\r\nof the fœtus to nature, and it is generally effected, though slowly\r\nand with difficulty. If however the patient becomes exhausted, or the\r\nhead be unusually large, the forceps are generally used after waiting\r\nfive or six hours. In these cases the head often becomes firmly fixed\r\nin the upper strait, so that great force is needed to dislodge it. The\r\nupper part passes through, owing to the overlapping of the bones, and\r\nthe scalp then bulges out like a large tumor, from being engorged with\r\nblood and serum, but the lower being more unyielding remains behind.\r\nIt is therefore impossible for the head to move either way, as it is\r\nformed like a figure 8, and held by the narrow part, as will be seen by\r\nthe following plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVI.\r\n\r\nThis Plate represents the head fixed, or impacted, at the upper strait\r\nof a narrow pelvis.]\r\n\r\nWhen the smallest diameter is not more than from _three inches to\r\ntwo and a half_, the birth is sometimes effected by nature, but with\r\nextreme difficulty. The accoucheur waits four or five hours, as in the\r\nformer case, and then if no progress is made he applies the forceps,\r\nusing great care in doing so. If the extraction is found impossible,\r\nwith reasonable force, the head must be opened and made smaller, even\r\nthough the child be living, because it is more proper to sacrifice it\r\nthan to risk the life of the mother. In a case like this however, no\r\none person would like to decide, unless in a great emergency; there\r\nshould always be a consultation if possible.\r\n\r\nA _dwarf_, named Lepratt, who used to perform at the theatres, was\r\ndelivered with the forceps by M. Dubois, though the pelvis only\r\nmeasured _three inches_. She perfectly recovered, though the child was\r\nborn dead: it was of fair average size.\r\n\r\nIt is contended by some that the delivery may be effected, under\r\npeculiarly favorable circumstances, when the passage measures only two\r\nand a half inches, and at all events the effort should be made; but\r\nfor the sake of the mother such cases should not be left long, as the\r\nchance is so small, and the risk of delay so great. When the passage is\r\n_less_ than two and a half inches, spontaneous or artificial delivery\r\nis allowed to be impossible, and the only alternatives then are to\r\ndismember the child or open the mother. Which of these should be done\r\ndepends on circumstances. Whenever the child _can_ be brought away by\r\nthe natural passages, though it be piecemeal, it always is so brought,\r\nunless the danger to the mother be greater than by the cesarian\r\noperation, in which case that operation is resorted to. By means of\r\nan instrument called the _Cephalotribe_, which crushes the head, the\r\nchild may be brought away, unless very large, when the pelvis only\r\nmeasures _two inches_. When the passage is _less than two inches_, the\r\nonly resort is to the cesarean operation, which sometimes succeeds, and\r\nsaves both mother and child, though more frequently the mother sinks.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for all these frightful operations is now much less than\r\nformerly, _and may be done away_ _with altogether_. This important\r\nfact should be known universally, and also the means to be resorted\r\nto. In the first place, every young female should be examined, before\r\nmarriage, by a competent person, if there be the slightest reason to\r\nsuspect deformity; and in case the deformity is found to exist, the\r\nconsequences if she becomes pregnant, must be laid before her. If,\r\nafter being told this, she _will marry_, or has already done so, the\r\nmeans of _avoiding conception_ should be placed at her disposal, so\r\nthat she may not be made, of necessity, a helpless victim. These means\r\nneed not be described here, though I have no hesitation in referring\r\nto them. When I know that the _life_, or _life-long health_, of a\r\nfemale, depends on her not becoming pregnant, I consider it my duty to\r\nput such means at her disposal, if she desires it. In many instances I\r\nhave known females suffer, several times, the most frightful tortures,\r\nmerely to bring into the world the mangled fragments of a dismembered\r\nchild, with the greatest risk to their own lives; and in others I have\r\nknown them in constant dread of becoming pregnant, because they were\r\nconscious it would be their death warrant. In such cases I leave it to\r\n_humanity_, and _common sense_, as to whether such information should\r\nbe withheld? _I_ could not reconcile it with my notions of _duty_ to\r\nwithhold it.\r\n\r\nIn case pregnancy has occurred before the deformity is discovered, and\r\nit is then found that a _full grown_ child cannot be born, premature\r\ndelivery must be brought on; or, in other words, the Uterus must be\r\nmade to expel the child before the full term, while it is yet small\r\nenough to pass through the Pelvis. This operation is of course only\r\nallowable when needed to preserve life, or to escape great suffering\r\nand danger. It must always be decided upon by the medical man, and\r\nperformed by him, so that a description of it is uncalled for here.\r\nIn Europe it is quite common, and nothing has tended so much to do\r\naway with those disgusting and horrid operations, on mother and child,\r\nwhich were formerly absolutely necessary in cases of deformity. If\r\nit is found at the first delivery of a female, or before, that she\r\ncannot bear a living child at full term, artificial delivery is\r\naccomplished at _seven_ or _eight_ months, thus avoiding all the\r\ndanger to the mother, and _frequently preserving the child_. In the\r\ncase of the _dwarf_ before referred to, when she became pregnant the\r\nsecond time, M. Dubois brought on premature delivery, and the child\r\nwas _born alive_, with but little difficulty. According to statistics\r\nit appears that, when artificial premature delivery has been induced,\r\nin _one hundred and sixty-one cases_ only _eight mothers_ have died,\r\nand all but _forty-six_ of the infants were born alive. Of the whole\r\nnumber of children _seventy-three_ continued to live; and of the eight\r\nmothers five died from other causes, leaving but _three_ whose death\r\nresulted from the operation. Now when the fearful number of deaths\r\nfrom instruments, and other operations, necessary at full term, is\r\nrecollected, the advantage of this practice will be evident. In the\r\nCesarian operation for instance, which is often the only remaining\r\nresort, but _one_ female out of _six_ recovers.\r\n\r\nThe delivery should be postponed as long as possible, so as to give\r\nthe best chance for the child living. This must of course be decided\r\nupon after the size of the pelvis is ascertained. Seven months is the\r\nearliest time at which the fœtus is viable, and it is much better left\r\ntill eight, if the size of the parts will allow of its birth then. In\r\ncase they are so small that it cannot be born even at seven months, we\r\nhave our choice, as M. Chailly remarks, _between the dreadful Cesarian\r\noperation at full term, and producing early miscarriage_.\r\n\r\nM. Dubois seems to recommend premature delivery in nearly all cases, if\r\nthe smallest diameter is _under three inches_; because, as he remarks,\r\nspontaneous delivery at _full term_ is then a very rare exception, and\r\nthe danger and suffering to the mother is so great. He also recommends\r\nit when there are tumors, and even when the female is afflicted with\r\nany acute disease. Of course it is always necessary, before operating,\r\nto be sure that the child is alive.\r\n\r\nI knew a lady myself who had given birth, at full term, to _seven_\r\nchildren, all of which were torn from her with instruments, _dead_,\r\nowing to the smallness of the pelvis. When pregnant with the _eighth_,\r\npremature delivery was brought on, at my suggestion, at about _seven\r\nmonths and a half_. The fœtus was born with comparative ease, and\r\n_lived_. But for this operation she probably would never have been\r\nblessed with a living child at all. Since then she has avoided\r\nconception.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS IN THE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nTumors of various kinds are met with, both in the bones of the pelvis\r\nand attached to the soft parts. They frequently offer the most serious\r\nimpediments to delivery, and baffle the skill of the most experienced\r\nobstetricians. In fact they differ so much in their structure, their\r\nsize, and their situation, that but few general directions can be given\r\nas to their management. In every case where one exists pregnancy\r\nshould never occur, if possible to be prevented, before it is removed;\r\nfor though it may cause no inconvenience at other times, yet during\r\ndelivery it may necessitate very serious operations, or even cause\r\ndeath. Some of these tumors are mere vesicles, or bags, filled with\r\nfluid, and may be punctured and their contents let out, so as to make\r\nthem less. Others are more or less solid but moveable, and may often\r\nbe supported above the upper strait till after the child is born. When\r\nthey are so large as to block up the passage, and are either fixed or\r\ncannot be carried up into the Womb, there is often no other choice than\r\nto either cut them out or open the child's head; the practice being\r\ndetermined by the circumstances of the case. In some instances the\r\nbladder itself, distended with urine, has impeded delivery, and been\r\nmistaken for a tumor; and in other instances stones in the bladder have\r\ncaused the same error.\r\n\r\nA specimen of one of these tumors is represented in Plate XLVII, and\r\none of a Polypus in Plate XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLVII.\r\n\r\n  This represents an Ovarian Tumor, which has descended before the head\r\n  of the child, and completely blocked up the passage. The delivery, it\r\n  will be seen, is utterly impossible in such a case, unless the Tumor\r\n  can either be pushed away, or reduced in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLVII.\r\n\r\nCase of Tumor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLATE XLVIII.\r\n\r\n  This Plate represents a case which occurred in the practice of Dr.\r\n  Ramsbotham, and which terminated favorably. The polypus had a very\r\n  long neck, and was forced _out of the external opening_ by the child,\r\n  which was then born with ease. I once saw a case myself, in which the\r\n  labor was completely arrested by a large hard tumor about the middle\r\n  of the Vagina; it could not be moved, and delivery was evidently\r\n  impossible while it remained. In consultation it was decided to cut\r\n  it out, as there seemed but little circulation of blood in it, and\r\n  its situation was favorable for the operation. This was accordingly\r\n  done with but little trouble, and the child was born without\r\n  difficulty in about twenty minutes after. The mother perfectly\r\n  recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLVIII.\r\n\r\nCase of Polypus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS EXTERNALLY.\r\n\r\nSometimes tumors exist externally, on the lips, or in the Vulva, but\r\nas they seldom offer much obstruction, and are easily detected and\r\nmanaged, but little need be said about them. They should always however\r\nbe attended to, if discovered, before labor comes on, or better still\r\nbefore pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the veins around the Vulva become much enlarged,\r\nand resemble tumors, and sometimes even impede delivery. It is usual\r\nthen to open them, and let out the blood, but not till the head is\r\nsufficiently low to press upon it and prevent dangerous bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTIONS IN THE VAGINA, AND NARROWNESS OR OBSTINATE RESISTANCE OF\r\nTHE VULVA AND PERINEUM.\r\n\r\nThe Vagina may be partly closed by its sides growing together, or it\r\nmay be united by bands and membranes stretching across; and these\r\nobstructions may be sufficient to impede or prevent delivery. Most\r\nusually they give way, and are gradually broken down by the pressure\r\nof the child's head; but if they prove too strong, after waiting a\r\nreasonable time, they must be cut through. Cases have even been known\r\nin which the _hymen_ has been found perfect at delivery, and even\r\noffered considerable resistance, so as to necessitate its being cut\r\nthrough before the child could be born. In such cases this membrane is\r\nunusually strong, and conception occurs without its being broken.\r\n\r\nWhen the perineum or Vulva remains rigid and hard, so that the opening\r\ncannot be enlarged sufficiently for the child to pass, it may also be\r\nnecessary to operate with the knife. But this should never be done till\r\nafter every means of relaxation has been tried, and the head has been\r\nkept back as long as prudent. It is however, always better to open a\r\npassage than to let one be _torn_, because it may be made in the most\r\nfavorable place. When the perineum is allowed to be torn, the most\r\nserious consequences often ensue, and the patient is made a miserable\r\nsufferer for life. The Vagina and Rectum may be torn into one, or the\r\npower of retaining the contents of the intestine, or bladder, may be\r\nfor ever lost. When an incision is made none of these evils follow; the\r\nwound speedily heals, and in a little time no trace of it can be seen.\r\nIt has even been necessary _to cut the neck of the Womb_, when it would\r\nnot open, to prevent the organ from being ruptured; and this has been\r\ndone with perfect safety. A celebrated practitioner in this city had to\r\nperform such an operation very recently, on a female who had injured\r\nherself, and made the mouth of the Womb grow together, by violent\r\nattempts to produce abortion. The delivery took place with comparative\r\nease, and no unpleasant results whatever followed, either to the mother\r\nor the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCAUSES CONNECTED WITH THE CHILD, OR CHILDREN, WHICH MAY IMPEDE\r\nDELIVERY, OR MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCIDENTIA OF THE UMBILICAL CORD.\r\n\r\nThis means the escape of a portion of the cord before the child itself.\r\nIt is most frequent in the irregular presentations, as they do not so\r\nfully close up the mouth of the Womb, and it is most likely to occur at\r\nthe commencement of labor, though not impossible at a later stage. Very\r\noften the cord descends when the membranes break, being carried down\r\nby the rush of the waters; and sometimes it is already in the sack, or\r\nbag, before the rupture takes place. This accident is comparatively\r\nfrequent, being found to occur as often as once in about three hundred\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe causes which produce procidentia of the cord, are most\r\nlikely these:--A large quantity of liquor amnii, and its sudden\r\ndischarge,--Unnatural presentations,--Deformities of the superior\r\nstrait of the Pelvis,--A very long cord,--and rupturing the membranes\r\ntoo early. But it may also happen from other causes with which we are\r\nunacquainted.\r\n\r\nThere is seldom much difficulty in detecting this accident, because\r\nif the membranes are broken it protrudes into the Vagina, and if they\r\nremain whole it can be felt within the sack, and its pulsation will be\r\nquite distinct. Sometimes, it is true, it may be so firmly compressed,\r\nbetween the fœtus and the walls of the pelvis, that its pulsation may\r\nbe very indistinct, or even totally suspended for a time; but this only\r\nnecessitates a little extra care.\r\n\r\nProcidentia of the cord may be very serious for the child; in fact, it\r\nis a frequent cause of its death. The reason of this will be evident\r\nwhen the functions of the cord are borne in mind. The circulation in it\r\nis as necessary for the life of the child before birth, as breathing is\r\nafter, and when protruded first it can seldom escape being so pressed\r\nupon as to stop its circulation, and hence the danger. To the mother\r\nit makes no difference whatever, unless it be told and alarm her; or\r\nunless violent efforts are made to correct it. She had therefore better\r\nnot know if it occurs.\r\n\r\nIf assistance is not rendered in this accident the consequences are\r\nalmost always fatal to the child, though in some instances the cord has\r\nremained hanging from the Vulva several inches, for an hour or more,\r\nand still the infant has been saved.\r\n\r\nIf the fallen cord is detected before the membranes are broken, it\r\nmay frequently be put back into the Womb without much difficulty. The\r\naccoucheur must wait till the mouth of the Womb is fully dilated, and\r\nthen watch his opportunity, in an interval between two contractions,\r\nto push the cord upwards, between the fœtus and the uterine walls. If\r\nhe succeeds in this, as is usually the case, he must then break the\r\nmembranes during the next pain, and this will bring the presenting part\r\nat once into the upper strait, and so block up the passage. To effect\r\nthis manœuvre it is requisite to introduce two or three fingers, and\r\nsometimes even the whole hand. It must never be attempted till the\r\nmouth is fully dilated, otherwise the membranes may be ruptured too\r\nsoon, and the delivery be delayed, thus increasing the danger.\r\n\r\nAfter the rupture of the membranes the replacing of the cord becomes a\r\nmuch more difficult matter, and frequently cannot be effected at all;\r\nparticularly if the head be descended far down. Every effort however\r\nmust be made, and if unsuccessful the delivery should be hastened as\r\nmuch as possible. In many such cases the _forceps_ are applied, and the\r\nchild brought away at once, because every moment's delay increases the\r\nrisk to its life.\r\n\r\nSeveral different kinds of instruments have been invented to return the\r\ncord, but they are seldom at hand when needed, and none of them are so\r\ngood as the hand itself.\r\n\r\nIf the return of the cord cannot be effected, and the progress of\r\nthe labor will allow of it, the hand is introduced and the child\r\nturned, unless the position of the head will allow of the advantageous\r\napplication of the forceps, in which case they are mostly resorted\r\nto. The only general rule is, to terminate the labor as speedily as\r\npossible, consistent with the welfare of the mother. In spite of all\r\nthat can be done the pulsation is often found to cease, and when the\r\nchild is born it is either quite dead or breathes but a few times.\r\n\r\nA very frequent indication that the fœtus suffers from compression of\r\nthe cord, is a greenish color of the water discharged, owing to the\r\ndischarge of _Meconium_ from the child's bowels. This is brought about,\r\nmost probably, by its straining, and its efforts to relieve itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTNESS OF THE CORD.\r\n\r\nThe cord is sometimes too short, and this may operate very unfavorably\r\nin many ways. It may keep the fœtus up in the Womb, and prevent it from\r\ndescending to the bottom of the Vagina,--it may cause the placenta to\r\nbe torn away too soon, and so lead to serious flooding,--it may pull\r\ndown and invert the Womb,--or it may make the labor very tedious, and\r\ncause the death of the child.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are but few signs of this accident, even after the\r\nrupture of the membranes, and none at all before, that can be depended\r\nupon. If the head has descended properly, and the parts be fully\r\nrelaxed, but still the expulsion is delayed from no obvious cause, it\r\nmay reasonably be supposed that shortness of the cord exists; and if so\r\nthere is very soon given a proof of it by a discharge of blood. This is\r\nowing either to the breaking of the cord, or to the separation of the\r\nplacenta, and is frequently the first intimation the assistant has of\r\nthe accident. All that can be then done is, to conclude the delivery as\r\nsoon as possible, and in the best way that circumstances will allow.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the cord is not too short absolutely, but is made so by\r\nbeing twined round the body or limbs of the child, which are often\r\n_cut off_ by it. M. Tasil saw a case where the cord round the neck\r\nhad nearly severed the head; and Montgomery gives several instances\r\nin which the limbs had been amputated in this way. Two of these are\r\nrepresented below:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIX.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.       Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n_Limbs cut off by the Cord._\r\n\r\nOccasionally the cord can be slipped over the head, or limbs, when\r\nwound round them, and the strain upon it be thus removed. If this\r\ncannot be done however, and the danger increases, relief may be\r\nobtained by _cutting the cord_, particularly if it be absolutely short.\r\nBut this must not be done till everything indicates that the labor will\r\nprobably soon terminate; and the end connected with the child must be\r\ncarefully held, or tied.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCENT OF OTHER PARTS WITH THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n_One Arm._--The descent of one arm along with the head may cause\r\nsome delay and difficulty, but Nature nearly always overcomes the\r\nimpediment. It is seldom that the arm can be reduced, and therefore\r\nbut little can be done at first; if the delivery be evidently arrested\r\nby it the accoucheur must at last assist in the most feasible manner.\r\nSometimes even it is necessary for him to apply the forceps.\r\n\r\n_The Two Arms._--Even this difficulty is often overcome spontaneously,\r\nthough much more rarely than the former one. As soon as it is detected,\r\nthe accoucheur must endeavor to return one or both of the limbs, if the\r\nlabor has not proceeded too far; and if he cannot succeed the delivery\r\nmust be accomplished as soon as possible, either by turning or with the\r\nforceps, unless there be reasonable ground for delay.\r\n\r\n_The Feet._--Either one or both of the feet may also descend with the\r\nhead, at first, though they usually recede and allow the head to be\r\nborn alone. When they are so impacted as to prevent the delivery being\r\ncompleted, the accoucheur must interfere. In most cases he will find it\r\nquite easy to push the feet above the head, and allow that to descend\r\nalone; but if this is not possible he must introduce one hand, grasp\r\nthe feet with it, and pull them down, while the other pushes the head\r\nup. This will turn the child, and if it be in no immediate danger, and\r\nthe mother is not suffering, the rest may be left to nature; but if\r\nthe contrary is the case, the delivery must be finished as speedily as\r\npossible. When the head is very low down it may be necessary to use the\r\nforceps, but great care must be observed not to grasp the feet along\r\nwith the head when using them.\r\n\r\n_A Foot and Arm._--The proceeding is the same as with the foot alone.\r\nIf the limbs cannot be returned the head and arm must be pushed up,\r\nwhile the foot is brought down.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWINS AND TRIPLETS.\r\n\r\nIn most cases where there are two or more children the delivery is\r\neasier than with one, because they are generally small, and the first\r\none so prepares the way that the rest are born without difficulty. It\r\nis also a fact that twins are nearly always born before full term, and\r\nconsequently are not quite grown.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the second fœtus usually takes place, immediately\r\nafter the first, though sometimes the Womb stops contracting, and it\r\nis not born for half an hour or more, and it may even remain for hours\r\nor days. It is a question whether, in such a case, the second delivery\r\nshould be left for Nature to finish, or whether the accoucheur should\r\nterminate it sooner artificially. The most general practice is to wait\r\nonly about half an hour, and then, if the Womb is still inert, use\r\nfriction, or other necessary means, to excite it, and accomplish the\r\nsecond delivery as soon as possible. If there be more than two the\r\nproceeding is still the same.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties may arise however with twins, which it is necessary\r\nto be prepared for. Thus the two heads may come together, and mutually\r\nimpede each other. In this case the one which moves the easiest must be\r\npushed up till the other is descended sufficiently low. One head may\r\nalso descend with one or two feet; in which case, if the feet cannot be\r\nreturned, the head must be pushed up, and they must be brought down.\r\nThe force exerted however, must not be very great at first, because\r\n_one may belong to each of the children_, and much injury may be done;\r\na little gentle traction will soon detect this however, with ordinary\r\ncare. If two arms, or one arm and a foot descend, the same care is\r\nalso required, before pulling upon them, to ascertain that they are\r\nnot parts of the _two_ children. Sometimes when the head of one twin\r\ndescends along with the feet of the other they may, if small, descend\r\ntogether. But if this is impossible, and interference is needed, we\r\nmust first try to push up the head; and if this cannot be done, _it_\r\nmust be drawn upon, not the feet; because if the feet were drawn down\r\nthe two children would soon occupy the passage together, body and head,\r\nand would perhaps become firmly wedged. In nearly every case one of the\r\ntwins presents by the head and the other by the feet, as formerly shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCESSIVE SIZE OF THE FŒTUS, OR THE DISEASED DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN\r\nPARTS.\r\n\r\n_Fœtus too large._--It is very rarely the case that the Fœtus is so\r\nlarge as not to pass easily through a well-formed Pelvis, though such\r\ncases have been known. The mode of proceeding is of course precisely\r\nthe same as if the pelvis were too small. If no means will succeed in\r\nabstracting the Fœtus whole, it must be made less; but Nature should be\r\nfirst allowed full time to act with all her force.\r\n\r\n_Hydrocephalus._--This consists of an accumulation of water in the\r\nhead of the child, and is usually termed watery head. The bones of the\r\ncranium will sometimes be widely separated by it, and the head be made\r\nso large that it cannot possibly be born till made less. The causes\r\nwhich produce this disease before birth are unknown.\r\n\r\nIn cases of hydrocephalus the head does not descend into the straits,\r\nowing to its size, and is felt to be full and firm, during a pain, but\r\nsoft and yielding during the intervals, especially at the fontanelles\r\nand sutures, which are also very large. The bones are usually very wide\r\nasunder, or even totally separated, as if floating in the fluid.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, when the quantity of fluid is but small, the delivery\r\nmay terminate spontaneously; the head lengthening, from being so soft,\r\nand thus adapting itself to the size and form of the strait. Most\r\nfrequently however, assistance is rendered in such cases, either by the\r\nforceps, which will sometimes succeed, or by puncturing the head, and\r\nletting out the fluid. This operation has been performed and the child\r\nsaved, though such an occurrence can never be reasonably anticipated.\r\nSuch instances however, show that great care should be taken not to\r\ninjure the brain, as that would destroy the small chance there is.\r\n\r\nDropsy may also occur in the chest, or abdomen of the child, causing\r\nsimilar difficulty with dropsy of the head. If the natural or\r\nartificial expulsion of the child cannot be effected without, the part\r\nmust be carefully punctured, and the fluid evacuated.\r\n\r\n_Tumors on the Fœtus._--Sometimes various kinds of tumors form on the\r\nchild's body, but they are rarely so large as to prevent delivery,\r\nthough they may delay it. If they should be too large however, it will\r\nbe necessary to remove them, as in the case of tumors in the Pelvis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSSIFICATION OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the bones of the head will be so hard, and so closely\r\nunited, that they will not overlap, in which case the labor may be\r\nvery difficult, unless the head is small, or the pelvis very large.\r\nIf after waiting a reasonable time, there be no prospect of the\r\nlabor terminating naturally, and the female is exhausted, it must be\r\nterminated artificially, as if it were a case of deformed pelvis. It is\r\nseldom however, that the head does not eventually give way.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS PRESENTATIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE FŒTUS, FROM WHICH THE LABOR\r\nMAY BE DIFFICULT OR PROTRACTED.\r\n\r\n_Presentations of the Face._--These are usually more difficult, and\r\nlonger, than those of the head. They will nearly always however,\r\nterminate spontaneously, or with ordinary assistance; but, if they\r\nshould not, artificial delivery must be practised, either by turning,\r\nif the case be not too far advanced, or with the forceps. Some of\r\nthe most celebrated authors recommend that all these cases should be\r\ntreated like cases of natural labor. Dr. Merriman says that in some\r\n_very favorable_ instances turning may be practised with safety and\r\nadvantage; but Dr. Lee says, \"My firm belief is, that the child, even\r\nunder such favorable circumstances, would have a far better chance\r\nto be born alive if the labor were left wholly to Nature; or, if the\r\nnatural powers were inadequate, to be extracted with the forceps.\"\r\nIn such cases there is often too little patience, and too much\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n_The forehead inclined against the Pubes._--In this position the labor\r\nmay be long delayed, and difficult, and most practitioners endeavor\r\nto turn the head round, if they cannot bring down the feet, or else\r\napply the forceps at once. Dr. Lee however remarks, and very properly,\r\n\"From all that I have seen of these cases, I am disposed to believe\r\nthat it is best to leave them to the natural efforts, and to avoid all\r\ninterference, all attempts to change the position, while the pains\r\ncontinue regular, and the head advances, however slowly.\" If the labor\r\ndoes not progress at all, or the female becomes exhausted, of course\r\nartificial delivery is necessary.\r\n\r\nSeveral _varieties_ of head and face presentations may also retard\r\nlabor considerably, but Nature nearly always overcomes the difficulty;\r\nor if she cannot do so mere ordinary assistance is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked, in another place, that breech\r\npresentations mostly terminate spontaneously, and that but few of them\r\nrequire interference. In some of them even, when the pelvis is large,\r\nor the fœtus small, the delivery is effected quite rapidly. Still such\r\npresentation occasionally causes delay and difficulty, and necessitate\r\nmore or less assistance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mouth of the Womb is opened sufficiently, unless the\r\nlabor is rapidly progressing without it, one of the fingers may be\r\nintroduced and _hooked_ over the groin, and a little gentle force\r\nexerted upon it. This will assist very much, and will often be all\r\nsufficient. If the pelvis is too small, or the fœtus too large, and\r\nthe delivery is evidently arrested, the breech must be pushed up, if\r\npossible, and the feet be brought down, as in turning. The remarks of\r\nDr. Lee on this presentation are so plain and practical, and marked\r\nwith such good sense, that I think a better explanation of what should\r\nbe done in such cases-could hardly be given, I will therefore quote his\r\nremarks in full:--\r\n\r\n \"Having ascertained that the nates present, whatever the position\r\n of the fœtus may be, whether the abdomen look backward or forward,\r\n we cannot alter it with safety, and no change can be required to be\r\n made till the nates and lower extremities are expelled. The os uteri\r\n dilates slowly in most cases of nates presentation, but we cannot\r\n employ any means with advantage to accelerate the delivery, and in\r\n most cases, if we do not interfere, but wait patiently, they are\r\n gradually pressed lower and lower into the pelvis, and at last escape\r\n from the vagina without any assistance. If the os uteri and vagina\r\n are imperfectly dilated, and the nates are drawn down or pass rapidly\r\n through the pelvis, the child is often lost. The membranes should not\r\n be ruptured, and the expulsion of the nates should be left entirely\r\n to the natural efforts, unless the labor is protracted and exhaustion\r\n takes place. Except supporting the perineum, nothing is required in a\r\n great proportion of these cases before the nates and lower extremities\r\n have been expelled, when it becomes necessary to ascertain precisely\r\n the relative position of the child to the pelvis, to rectify this if\r\n it is unfavorable, and artificially extract the superior extremities\r\n and head, to prevent the fatal compression of the umbilical cord. If\r\n we find, after the expulsion of the nates and lower extremities, that\r\n the toes are directed forward, or that the child is in the position\r\n represented in the second figure, with its abdomen applied to the\r\n anterior part of the uterus, and that its back lies along the spine\r\n of the mother, we should wrap the nates and sides in a soft napkin,\r\n and turn the child very gently round during a pain, observing to\r\n which side the feet are inclined to turn, till its abdomen is to\r\n the spine of the mother, and the toes are directed backward to the\r\n hollow of the sacrum, or to the side of the pelvis. In many cases\r\n the nates turn round in the passage spontaneously, so that it is not\r\n required artificially to alter the position. It is necessary always\r\n to recollect that it is possible to turn the body of the child round\r\n without turning the face round into the hollow of the sacrum, and\r\n that the chin may be over the symphysis pubis when the front of the\r\n chest and abdomen are turned backward. After the lower extremities and\r\n body of the child have been expelled, and placed in the most favorable\r\n position for the extraction of the superior extremities and head, it\r\n is necessary to proceed without loss of time to draw these through\r\n the pelvis, that the child may not be destroyed by compression of\r\n the umbilical cord. As pressure upon the cord for a very short time\r\n will in some cases kill the child, it is proper to watch closely the\r\n pulsations of its arteries. Draw the body of the child forward as\r\n far as the arm-pits, and place it over the palm of your right hand\r\n and fore-arm, and gently draw the body towards the left thigh of the\r\n mother; then pass the fore and middle fingers of your left hand along\r\n the back part of the left arm of the child to the elbow-joint, and\r\n press down the arm with your lingers along the thorax of the child,\r\n and extract it. Then transfer the body of the child and left arm to\r\n your left hand and fore-arm for support, and with the fore and middle\r\n fingers of your right hand disengage and bring down, in the same way,\r\n the right arm of the child; then pass the fore and middle fingers of\r\n your left hand into the mouth of the child, or rather over the lower\r\n and upper jaw, and at the same time place the fore and middle fingers\r\n of your right hand over the back part of the neck and occiput, and\r\n with the fingers of the two hands thus applied extract the head, in\r\n the line of the axis of the pelvis. The perineum is very rigid in some\r\n cases of nates presentation, where it is the first child, and it will\r\n be torn if the head is extracted hastily, and not drawn forward to the\r\n symphysis pubis. When you feel the pulsations of the cord beginning to\r\n cease, you may be tempted to employ greater extracting force than the\r\n neck of the child and perineum can bear, and both may be destroyed.\r\n The only method of obviating this is to press back the edge of the\r\n perineum, that the air may gain admission into the mouth of the child,\r\n and the respiration go on, when the circulation in the cord has been\r\n arrested, until the perineum is sufficiently dilated to slide back\r\n over the face, and allow the head to pass. I have seen from twenty\r\n minutes to half an hour elapse in some cases, after the cord had\r\n ceased to pulsate, before the perineum would allow the head to escape,\r\n during which time the respiration was regularly performed. This is\r\n not a new practice; it has been alluded to by some of the older\r\n accoucheurs, and some others; and the advantages to be derived from\r\n it were fully pointed out some years ago by Dr. Bigelow, in a paper\r\n published in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, 'On the\r\n means of affording Respiration to Children in Reversed Presentations.'\r\n The object of Dr. Bigelow in this paper is to show that in many cases\r\n the life of the child may be saved by forming a communication between\r\n the mouth and atmosphere previous to the delivery of the head. If the\r\n head be low down, the fingers alone can give the necessary assistance;\r\n but if it is high in the pelvis, and is reached with difficulty, the\r\n assistance of a tube may be necessary. He recommends a flat tube,\r\n which is to be guarded, and kept within the fingers of the inserted\r\n hand.\r\n\r\n \"Where the pelvis of the mother is small or distorted, and the\r\n child large and unfavorably situated, the efforts of nature may be\r\n insufficient to expel the child, either alive or dead. The nates may\r\n become so firmly impacted in the pelvis, that they cannot advance\r\n without artificial assistance. A finger should be passed up to one\r\n of the groins, and when a pain comes on a considerable extracting\r\n force may be exerted with it, without injuring the child; or a soft\r\n handkerchief may be passed between the thigh and abdomen, and the\r\n nates drawn down; but this cannot be done unless they have descended\r\n low into the cavity of the pelvis. Where these means fail, and it is\r\n impossible to extract the child alive, the blunt hook or crotchet\r\n must be employed. In cases of nates presentation, where the pelvis\r\n is distorted, after the extraction of the trunk and extremities, it\r\n is necessary to perforate the back part of the head, and complete\r\n the delivery with the crotchet. In presentations of the feet and\r\n knees the treatment does not essentially differ from that required in\r\n presentations of the nates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENTATIONS OF THE SHOULDER.\r\n\r\nThese are the most dangerous of all the presentations, and most\r\nfrequently require assistance; in fact the delivery can seldom be\r\nterminated naturally when the shoulder presents.\r\n\r\nSometimes the child will pass doubled up, as formerly explained, but\r\nthis must not be too confidently expected. Dr. Lee says--\r\n\r\n \"It is now a general rule, established in all countries where\r\n midwifery is understood, that in cases of preternatural labor, where\r\n the shoulder and superior extremities of the child present, the\r\n operation of turning ought to be performed. But the hand must not\r\n be forced into the uterus, if the orifice is rigid and undilatable;\r\n it should be dilated nearly to the size of half-a-dollar piece or\r\n more, or the margin ought to be very thin, soft, and yielding, if it\r\n is expanded to a smaller extent than this when turning is attempted.\r\n If the os uteri will not admit the extremities of the fingers and\r\n thumb in a conical form to be introduced without much force, if it is\r\n thick, hard, and unyielding, some delay is necessary, that the parts\r\n may relax, death being almost always the consequence of thrusting the\r\n hand with violence through the orifice of the uterus in a rigid and\r\n undilatable condition, whether the membranes be ruptured or not. But\r\n as soon as it will admit of the safe introduction of the hand, where\r\n you have ascertained that an arm presents, no time should be lost in\r\n completing the delivery, otherwise the membranes may give way, the\r\n liquor amnii be evacuated, and a case of little difficulty and danger\r\n be suddenly converted into one equally hazardous to the mother and\r\n child. In all cases of labor, where the first stage is far advanced\r\n without the nature of the presentation being positively determined, or\r\n a superior extremity is felt through the membranes, the patient should\r\n be kept in the horizontal position, that they may not be ruptured;\r\n and you should remain in constant attendance upon the patient, and be\r\n prepared to interfere the instant the necessity arises.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the operation of turning in these cases he remarks as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n \"In some favorable cases of shoulder and arm presentation, the uterus\r\n is widely dilated before the membranes are ruptured and the liquor\r\n amnii discharged; and no difficulty is experienced in passing the\r\n hand into the uterus, laying hold of the feet, and extracting the\r\n child by the operation of turning. If the uterus is not contracting\r\n strongly and at short intervals, little resistance is offered to\r\n the introduction of the hand, and the delivery may be speedily\r\n accomplished with safety both to the mother and child. But if the\r\n membranes have burst, the liquor amnii escaped, and the uterus has\r\n been contracting firmly upon the child many hours before the operation\r\n of turning is attempted, the child is often destroyed by the pressure,\r\n and the coats of the uterus exposed to great danger from contusion\r\n and laceration in passing up the hand and bringing down the feet. The\r\n shoulder and thorax become so strongly impacted in the pelvis, that\r\n great force is required to introduce the hand to grasp the feet, and\r\n much exertion necessary before the position can be changed.\r\n\r\n \"In other cases of shoulder and arm presentation, the membranes\r\n burst and the liquor amnii escapes at the commencement of labor,\r\n and the os uteri is rigid and undilated, so that the hand cannot be\r\n passed into the uterus after the labor has continued many hours. The\r\n difficulty and danger of these cases is greatly increased when the\r\n uterus is contracting with violence, and the pelvis is distorted, or\r\n a disproportion exists between the child and pelvis from any other\r\n cause. The greater number of women, if abandoned to the efforts of\r\n nature under these circumstances--the uterus having no power to alter\r\n the position of the fœtus--would ultimately die undelivered, from\r\n exhaustion or rupture of the uterus and vagina.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately these cases are very rare, and when assistance is rendered\r\n_early_, the difficulty is readily overcome. This is a strong reason\r\nwhy all women especially should know what to do, because a little\r\ntimely help may save much suffering, or even life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS DURING LABOR WHICH MAY COMPROMISE THE MOTHER'S LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nUTERINE HEMORRHAGE, OR FLOODING, DURING LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is always a troublesome, and frequently a fatal accident. It\r\nshould be always watched for, and attended to as early as possible--_a\r\nfew minutes_ frequently determining the recovery or death of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of flooding are, the too early or violent, separation\r\nof the placenta; insertion of the placenta over the mouth or on the\r\nneck of the womb; laceration of the womb or vagina; the bursting of\r\na swelled vein; rupture of one or more of the blood vessels of the\r\nuterus; and breaking of the cord.\r\n\r\nProbably the most frequent of these causes are the premature or violent\r\nseparation of the cord, and the bursting of the blood vessels. The\r\ninsertion of the placenta over the mouth of the womb, instead of on\r\nthe fundus, occurs very seldom, but when it does severe flooding is\r\nnearly certain to follow, because the placenta has then to be torn,\r\nby the expansion of the parts, at the very commencement of the labor,\r\nand probably continues to pour out blood for a long time before the\r\nchild is delivered, and it can be expelled. In fact this occurrence,\r\nunless the labor terminates very speedily, is nearly always fatal to\r\nthe mother, and frequently to the child also. In most cases there is\r\nmore or less hemorrhage from this cause during gestation, particularly\r\nafter the sixth month, when the neck of the uterus begins to enlarge\r\nmore than the placenta, and consequently tears away from it. Abortion\r\nfrequently results also, if the flooding be not stopped. Madame Boivin\r\ntells us that in _twenty thousand three hundred and fifty-seven_\r\ndeliveries there were but _eight_ cases in which the placenta grew\r\nover the mouth of the womb; which is equal to _one_ case in every _two\r\nthousand five hundred and fifty-four_. Dr. Churchill has collected the\r\naccounts of _one hundred and seventy-four cases_ of this kind, and he\r\nfinds that out of these forty-eight terminated fatally; or nearly _one\r\nout of every three_.\r\n\r\nThe rupture of the blood vessels may occur when they are too much\r\nengorged with blood, or when their coats are weakened and corroded\r\nby disease. Shortness of the cord may also produce a rupture of the\r\nvessels, by the strain it causes on them and on the membranes.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the flooding comes on suddenly, without any warning\r\nwhatever, though most usually it is preceded by a sensation of\r\nweight, heat, and fluttering in the pelvis, pains in the thighs and\r\nback, flushed face, headache, and dizziness. The pulse also becomes\r\nirregular, the hands and feet grow cold, and the ears often ring, or\r\nbuzz. The only certain sign that the hemorrhage has really commenced\r\nis the appearance of the blood itself, and this often occurs, as\r\npreviously remarked, without any premonitory sign whatever.\r\n\r\nThe danger from hemorrhage during labor is greatest when it commences\r\nthe earliest, because it has then the longest to last. From any of the\r\ncauses mentioned it is evident that it must continue till delivery is\r\naccomplished, and therefore if it appears at the commencement of the\r\nlabor it may cause the death of both mother and child, before the\r\nlabor can be terminated. The danger is greatest however to the child,\r\nunless the flow be very profuse indeed, and then it is equally so to\r\nboth. After delivery the danger is of course only to the mother; and\r\nthe rapidity with which it may compromise her life is in some cases\r\nfearful. Dr. Lee thus speaks of such cases.\r\n\r\n \"But one of the most dangerous varieties of uterine hemorrhage is that\r\n which follows the expulsion of the placenta, or its removal from the\r\n uterus by art. Sometimes the blood escapes in great quantities from\r\n the uterus immediately after the removal of the placenta, and the\r\n pulse ceases at the wrist, and consciousness is entirely lost in a few\r\n seconds. There is no symptom before labor has commenced, or during its\r\n progress, to warn you of what is about to take place. The child has\r\n been safely delivered, the placenta has come away in a short time, and\r\n while you are perhaps congratulating yourself on the happy termination\r\n of the labor the blood begins to trickle over the bed upon the floor,\r\n or the patient suddenly complains of great faintness. In such cases\r\n there may be either a want of uterine contraction, or the contractions\r\n may not be permanent, but be followed by relaxation and the effusion\r\n of a large quantity of blood, which may either appear externally,\r\n or remain to become coagulated, and distend the uterus. For several\r\n hours after delivery, in some cases, this alternate relaxation and\r\n contraction goes on, to the great hazard of the patient, and if her\r\n condition be not clearly ascertained, and the proper remedies be\r\n employed, death may unexpectedly take place.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the treatment, he gives such excellent and practical\r\nrules, that I cannot do better than quote them.\r\n\r\n \"By far the most important remedies in these cases of uterine\r\n hemorrhage are constant and powerful pressure over the fundus uteri,\r\n the application of cold around the pelvis, and the free administration\r\n of wine, brandy, and other stimulants: ergot is indicated, but it\r\n most frequently produces no effect. The pressure and cold are always\r\n within our reach, however sudden the attack may be. The hypogastrium\r\n should be strongly compressed with the binder, and a pad of folded\r\n napkins placed under it, and in addition the hand should be firmly\r\n applied over the fundus uteri. I do not know who it was that first\r\n employed compression of the fundus uteri in cases of flooding after\r\n the birth of the child; but it has been often recommended, and there\r\n are few practitioners in this country who are not fully aware of\r\n the importance of the binder and pad, in exciting permanent and\r\n regular uterine contractions. Dr. M'Keevor states, that in 1815 it\r\n was recommended by Dr. Labatt in his lectures, and for a number of\r\n years before this Dr. Labatt was accustomed to recommend a thick firm\r\n pad, or compress over the pubes, previous to the application of the\r\n ordinary binder, where, in former labors, uterine hemorrhage had taken\r\n place. Dr. M'Keevor states, that of 6665 women delivered during the\r\n years 1819 and 1820, only 25 were attacked with hemorrhage after the\r\n birth of the child. Of these, 15 occurred before the expulsion of\r\n the placenta, ten afterwards, and in all the results was favorable.\r\n He saw only two fatal cases during the time he was in the Dublin\r\n Lying-in Hospital, and he attributes this small mortality partly\r\n to the process of parturition being left entirely to the unassisted\r\n gradual efforts of the uterus; partly to the patient having been kept\r\n cool and quiet, free from all sources of disturbance and irritation;\r\n but, above all, to the careful application of the binder immediately\r\n after delivery, by which means the expulsion of the placenta, and\r\n permanent contractions of the uterus, are most effectually secured,\r\n and whenever any tendency to hemorrhage did occur before the removal\r\n of the placenta, the first point invariably attended to was to tighten\r\n the binder, and in the event of this not succeeding, a thick firm\r\n compress, made by folding a couple of large coarse napkins into a\r\n square form, was placed over the region of the uterus, and the binder\r\n again adjusted. In the great majority of instances, these, with the\r\n admission of cool air, checked the discharge; if not sufficient,\r\n additional pressure was made with the hands.\r\n\r\n \"At the same time that you efficiently compress the fundus uteri\r\n with the binder and pad, cold should be vigorously applied to excite\r\n the contractions of the uterus. The best mode of doing this is\r\n to plunge a large napkin in a pitcher of cold water, and dash it\r\n suddenly against the external parts, the nates and thighs; and this\r\n should be repeated till the uterus contracts, and the violence of\r\n the hemorrhage is controlled. I am satisfied that this is the most\r\n efficacious method of applying cold to excite uterine contractions;\r\n it is far less formidable than pouring water from a height over the\r\n naked abdomen, but it is not less efficacious, and it possesses these\r\n decided advantages over the other method, that while the application\r\n is made to the external parts, nates, and thighs, the pressure of the\r\n binder and pad is not withdrawn from the hypogastrium, the position of\r\n the patient is not changed from the side to the back, the bed is not\r\n inundated with water, and the application can be repeated as often,\r\n and continued as long, as the urgency of the symptoms may require.\r\n The abdomen may be exposed once, and cold water poured over it from\r\n a height, and the uterus made to contract, and the flow of blood be\r\n arrested for a time, but relaxation of the uterus may follow after\r\n a short interval, and the hemorrhage be renewed again with equal\r\n violence as at first; but we cannot with propriety expose the abdomen\r\n a second time, and empty over it from a height the contents of a great\r\n decanter or kettle. Besides, by adopting this practice, we sacrifice\r\n the whole of the effects derived from pressure on the fundus uteri.\r\n The application of a napkin soaked in vinegar and water to the parts\r\n is often sufficient, along with the binder, to restrain the hemorrhage\r\n where it is not very profuse.\r\n\r\n \"I have very seldom introduced a plug of any kind into the vagina in\r\n these cases, but when there has been a draining of blood from the\r\n uterus, after the practice now described has been employed, a large\r\n soft sponge passed into the vagina, and pressed up against the os\r\n uteri, has appeared in some cases to promote the coagulation of the\r\n blood. The sponge, however, cannot be employed with safety after the\r\n expulsion of the child and placenta, unless the uterus be firmly\r\n compressed above the brim of the pelvis to prevent its becoming\r\n distended with blood. More frequently I have had recourse with good\r\n effect, to the introduction of several pieces of smooth ice into\r\n the upper part of the vagina, and allowing them to remain there, in\r\n contact with the os uteri, and be dissolved, or pieces of ice have\r\n been inclosed in a bladder and laid over the pubes.\r\n\r\n \"Other means besides those now described have been recommended in\r\n cases of flooding after the expulsion of the placenta. It has been\r\n proposed to inject cold water into the cavity of the uterus by means\r\n of the stomach pump, and favorable reports have been given of the\r\n practice. The effect, I think, would be similar to directing forcibly\r\n a stream of cold water against a stump soon after amputation; the\r\n coagula in the cavity of the uterus and in the orifices of the\r\n vessels would be all washed away: nevertheless, it might perhaps\r\n be advantageous in some desperate cases. Port wine and water, as\r\n cold as possible, Dr. Collins says, injected into the rectum, has\r\n been of service. Some of the earlier writers on midwifery, and many\r\n in the present century, have strongly recommended the introduction\r\n of the hand within the uterus for the purpose of removing the\r\n coagula accumulated within the cavity, and to excite the uterus to\r\n contract. But it is not necessary to pass the hand into the uterus\r\n for the removal of coagula, because if the binder has been properly\r\n applied, and strong pressure made over the fundus uteri, clots cannot\r\n accumulate within the uterus, and if they have been permitted to\r\n collect in consequence of neglect, then expulsion will immediately\r\n follow the use of proper compression of the hypogastrium, without\r\n the introduction of the hand. Nor do I consider it necessary, to\r\n excite uterine contractions, that the hand should ever be introduced\r\n into the cavity of the uterus after the removal of the placenta. I\r\n am fully convinced, from repeated observation, that this practice,\r\n which is so common as to be almost universal in this country at the\r\n present time, is often not only ineffectual for the purpose, in the\r\n worst cases of flooding, but that it is often followed by the most\r\n pernicious effects; the coagula which nature has formed have been\r\n displaced by the hand, and the uterus has not been excited by the\r\n stimulus of it to secure a permanent contraction. In the greater\r\n number of fatal cases of uterine hemorrhage after the expulsion of\r\n the placenta, which have come under my observation, the hand had been\r\n introduced into the cavity, and the closed fist had been pressed for\r\n a longer or shorter time round and round against the lining membrane,\r\n to make the uterus contract. I do not recollect a single fatal case,\r\n where the unfortunate result could be fairly attributed to the want\r\n of the introduction of the hand into the cavity of the uterus, and\r\n the friction of the knuckles against the lining membrane. I have\r\n repeatedly passed the hand into the uterus to produce contraction, but\r\n it has refused to obey the stimulus of the hand; it has remained like\r\n a soft flaccid bag, more like a piece of intestine than uterus, and\r\n the blood has continued to pour down the arm, until the hand has been\r\n withdrawn, and more efficient remedies employed. Leroux was well aware\r\n that the stimulus of the hand would not in all cases excite the uterus\r\n to contract, for he observes, \"where the os uteri is contracted,\r\n the means indicated by Levret are very efficacious, and remove the\r\n hemorrhage as if by a charm. But it is not so in complete inertia of\r\n the uterus; often it is widely dilated, and offers no resistance to\r\n the introduction of the hand. The introduction even of the whole hand\r\n excites little sensation, and the woman will promptly perish from\r\n hemorrhage if other means more active and certain are not employed to\r\n prevent it.\" The tampon or plug is the remedy Leroux recommends in\r\n cases of flooding after delivery, and he affirms that it will often\r\n succeed in stopping the flow of blood when all other means fail. Dr.\r\n Dewees observes, that he has not found it necessary to introduce the\r\n hand for the purpose of stopping an hemorrhage after the expulsion of\r\n the placenta, during the last five-and-thirty years, as he regarded\r\n the practice as always frightful, and oftentimes unnecessary and\r\n pernicious. But it is difficult to subvert an established mode of\r\n practice, however unsound, and probably some of you, without much\r\n reflection, because you have heard this recommended, will pass up\r\n the hand into the cavity of the uterus after the expulsion of the\r\n placenta, on the very first occasion that you have an opportunity of\r\n doing so, remove all the coagula, and rub the inner surface with the\r\n fist till you are tired, without effect. I have seen cases repeatedly\r\n where this has been diligently performed by those who had neglected to\r\n apply the pad and binder, and all the other means now described. If\r\n you pass the hand at all within the parts, which I strongly suspect\r\n you will do, let me entreat you to carry it no farther than the os\r\n uteri, which you may, with much less risk and with greater effect,\r\n press and rub with the fingers and irritate than the inner surface of\r\n the body and fundus of the uterus.\r\n\r\n \"Mauriceau recommends that women who are subject to flooding after\r\n delivery should be bled twice or thrice from the arm during pregnancy,\r\n and once, or oftener, after labor has commenced. There are cases of\r\n uterine hemorrhage after the delivery of the child and expulsion of\r\n the placenta unconnected altogether with the plethora, or an excited\r\n state of the heart and arteries, and where bleeding and low diet\r\n do not prevent the accident. Rupturing the membranes at the very\r\n commencement of labor is by far the best remedy, the only thing indeed\r\n upon which any dependance can be placed.\r\n\r\n \"After attacks of uterine hemorrhage, the patient should not be raised\r\n from the horizontal position for several hours, and the strength\r\n should be supported by wine, beef-tea, and light nourishment. Brandy\r\n in gruel sometimes agrees when wine is rejected. A good large dose\r\n of the liquor opii sedativus often produces the most decided benefit\r\n after the hemorrhage has ceased; there are few cases before this\r\n in which opium does good, though it is constantly given in all the\r\n varieties of flooding, even when the great object is to excite uterine\r\n action. Where recovery is to take place after uterine hemorrhage,\r\n says Dr. M. Hall, the pallor of the countenance, the disposition to\r\n syncope, the coldness of the extremities, the feeble state of the\r\n pulse, and uninterrupted respiration, pass gradually away. Where\r\n the case is to terminate fatally, the symptoms gradually assume a\r\n more alarming aspect, the countenance becomes pale and sunk, the\r\n respiration stertorous, and the pulse cannot be felt at the wrist.\r\n There is great restlessness, and before death one or more fits of\r\n convulsions sometimes occur. Where recovery takes place, in some women\r\n it is astonishing how little permanent inconvenience is felt from the\r\n great loss of blood which they have sustained. In the course of ten\r\n days or a fortnight the effects have entirely disappeared; and this\r\n is the most common result. In some women, a violent determination of\r\n blood takes place to the brain, marked by heat, strong pulsations of\r\n the carotid and temporal arteries, intolerance of light, and all the\r\n symptoms of inflammation of the brain or its membranes. A strong\r\n febrile attack is also sometimes experienced, without an increased\r\n determination of blood to any particular organ. These affections of\r\n the brain and nervous system are aggravated by depletion. The patient\r\n should be kept in a cool, dark room, and mild cathartics, anodynes,\r\n and antispasmodics, occasionally given. Where there is much headache\r\n and throbbing, a few leeches should be applied to the temples, and a\r\n cold lotion to the scalp.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks of Dr. Lee, as to bleeding frequently making the after\r\nsymptoms worse, should be carefully borne in mind. There is no doubt\r\nbut that too copious, or too frequent bleeding, during pregnancy or\r\nlabor, disposes the female to many serious dangers afterwards. I have\r\nknown some suffer constant headache, dizziness, and loss of memory, for\r\nweeks after from it; and others have even been made light headed.\r\n\r\nTo the above remedies I would only append one other, which has, on many\r\noccasions succeeded, when all others have failed, namely _Galvanism_.\r\nThis has, at the last moment, when the female was sinking, brought\r\non uterine contractions, stopped the flooding, and saved her life.\r\nThe application is very simple; one pole being placed on the back,\r\nimmediately between the hips, and the other over the uterus. Or one\r\nof the poles may be coated with wax, all but the end, and introduced\r\ninto the vagina, so that the unwaxed part may touch the mouth of the\r\nwomb, while the other is placed over the fundus, or on the back, as\r\nfound most efficient. The power should be sufficiently strong to\r\nproduce contraction, and the application must be continued till the\r\ncontraction remains after the pole is withdrawn. No medical man should\r\ngive any female up who is flooding, no matter how severely, till he has\r\ntried Galvanism. In my \"_Neuropathy_\" and \"_Practical Facts_\" will be\r\nfound many cases, with such plain directions that any one could follow\r\nthem and apply it.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the placenta, or its growth over the mouth of the\r\nwomb, is the most serious cause of flooding, and generally makes any\r\nattempt to check it of no avail, except _delivery_. The discharge\r\nhowever nearly always occurs before the full period, and either causes\r\nmiscarriage or necessitates premature delivery. Dr. Lee remarks:\r\n\r\n \"In the greater number of cases of placental presentation the\r\n discharge of blood takes place spontaneously in the seventh and eighth\r\n months of pregnancy, and cannot be referred either to bodily exertion,\r\n external violence, nor to any unusual determination to the uterine\r\n organs, or congestion of their vessels. The hemorrhage generally comes\r\n on suddenly, when the woman is in a state of rest, and the blood\r\n continues to flow until faintness or even syncope takes place. It\r\n often ceases entirely, and the patient resumes her usual occupations,\r\n and has no dread of another attack. But after an interval of several\r\n days, and sometimes not before two or three weeks, the flooding is\r\n renewed, and perhaps with increased violence, or a constant profuse\r\n discharge takes place, and a decided effect is produced upon the\r\n constitution,--the pulse becomes rapid and feeble, and the countenance\r\n pale. Similar attacks return at longer or shorter intervals, and if\r\n delivery be not accomplished by art, sooner or later death takes\r\n place. The first attack of flooding seldom proves fatal, but it\r\n sometimes does so; for in the second case related in the table, which\r\n occurred in the British Lying-in Hospital, the life of the patient\r\n was at once extinguished by a single gush of blood from the uterus. I\r\n examined the body after death. The centre of the placenta was over the\r\n centre of the os uteri.\r\n\r\n \"When flooding takes place to an alarming extent in the seventh or\r\n eighth months of gestation, you ought first to ascertain, by a careful\r\n internal examination, whether or not the placenta be situated at the\r\n os uteri. It is impossible, from the manner in which the discharge of\r\n blood takes place, to be certain of the fact; for there are some cases\r\n of hemorrhage from detachment of the placenta from the upper part of\r\n the uterus, where the flooding occurs spontaneously, and to as great\r\n an extent as in cases where the placenta presents. In some cases I\r\n have been induced, from the symptoms, to believe that the placenta was\r\n at the os uteri when it was not. As the treatment and the successful\r\n or fatal result of the case will, in a great measure, depend on the\r\n correctness of the diagnosis, the examination should be conducted with\r\n so much care and circumspection as to leave no room for doubt on the\r\n subject. An ordinary examination, with the fore and middle fingers, is\r\n generally sufficient to enable us to ascertain the true state of the\r\n case, but where the os uteri is very high up, and directed backwards,\r\n it becomes requisite to introduce the whole hand within the vagina.\r\n The finger should then be passed gently through the os uteri, and,\r\n if the placenta adheres to the cervix, it will be distinguished from\r\n coagulated blood, the only substance with which it can be confounded,\r\n by its firmer, fibrous, vascular structure, and, above all, by its\r\n adhering at one part to the uterus, and being separated at another.\r\n If you will take the trouble to pass the finger carefully and\r\n repeatedly over the uterine surface of a recently expelled placenta,\r\n you will never, in actual practice, mistake a placenta at the os uteri\r\n for a clot of blood, however firm. In all cases it is requisite to\r\n proceed at once to determine by an examination, so carefully conducted\r\n as to render a mistake impossible, whether or not the placenta\r\n presents--even though the hemorrhage should be slightly renewed by the\r\n displacement of the coagula; you cannot be too early acquainted with\r\n the precise condition of the patient. You ought, at the same time, to\r\n ascertain whether the placenta adheres partially or completely to the\r\n cervix uteri, and whether the os uteri is in a condition to admit of\r\n the operation of turning being performed.\r\n\r\n \"The operation of turning, which is required in all cases of complete\r\n placental presentation, is not necessary in the greater number of\r\n cases in which the edge of the placenta passing into the membranes can\r\n be distinctly felt through the os uteri. Sometimes there is profuse\r\n and dangerous hemorrhage where the placenta does not adhere all round\r\n to the neck of the uterus, but only partially. If the os uteri is not\r\n much dilated or dilatable, the best practice in these cases is to\r\n rupture the membranes, to excite the uterus to contract vigorously,\r\n by the binder, ergot, and all other means, and to leave the case to\r\n nature: by adopting this treatment the operation of turning may be\r\n avoided with advantage in the greater number of cases of partial\r\n placental presentation. But, if the hemorrhage is profuse, has\r\n returned at different intervals, and a great quantity has been lost,\r\n and the constitution is really affected, it is the safest practice at\r\n once, if the orifice of the uterus is in a condition to allow the\r\n hand to pass without difficulty, to deliver by turning the child.\r\n\r\n \"Where the placental presentation is complete, the operation of\r\n turning should be performed, in all cases, as soon as the orifice of\r\n the uterus is so much dilated or dilatable as to allow the hand to be\r\n introduced without the employment of much force. It is seldom safe to\r\n attempt to deliver by turning before the os uteri is so far dilated\r\n that you can easily introduce the points of the four fingers and thumb\r\n within it: however soft and relaxed it may be, until dilatation has\r\n commenced, and proceeded so far, I am convinced there are very few\r\n cases in which the operation of turning will be required, or completed\r\n without the risk of inflicting some injury on the os uteri. This is a\r\n point of the greatest practical importance, but I do not know in what\r\n manner to communicate to you, in words, a more clear and definite idea\r\n of the grounds upon which you ought to proceed.\r\n\r\n \"In every case, before attempting to turn, make a most careful\r\n examination of the os uteri, and endeavor, from the degree of\r\n dilatation, and the thinness and softness of the orifice, to form\r\n a correct judgment upon this point, before interfering, for the\r\n hemorrhage will be renewed if the attempt is unsuccessful, and the\r\n patient will be placed in a worse condition than she was before. When\r\n you have resolved to turn, let the patient lie on the left side,\r\n with the pelvis close to the edge of the bed, and introduce the\r\n right hand into the vagina as before described, and then pass the\r\n fingers and hand gently and slowly in a conical form through the os\r\n uteri, giving it time to dilate, and onward into the cavity between\r\n the detached portion of the placenta and the uterus: then force the\r\n fingers through the membranes, grasp both feet, and bring them down\r\n into the vagina, and _slowly_ extract the child as in the cases of\r\n nates presentation, and do not afterwards be in a hurry to remove the\r\n placenta, unless it is wholly detached and lying in the upper part\r\n of the vagina. This operation is easily and speedily performed when\r\n the os uteri is widely dilated and dilatable. It is, however, a great\r\n exaggeration of the facility with which turning may be accomplished in\r\n these cases, to represent it as a very simple process--like putting\r\n the hand into the coat-pocket and pulling out your handkerchief.\r\n At the best it is a dangerous operation, and you can never tell\r\n with certainty whether or not the patient will recover after its\r\n performance, however easily it may have been effected.\r\n\r\n \"But there is not unfrequently most profuse and alarming flooding\r\n from complete placental presentation, where the os uteri is so thick,\r\n rigid, and undilatable, that it is impossible to introduce the hand\r\n into the uterus without producing certain mischief. In thirteen out\r\n of thirty-six recorded cases the os uteri was rigid and undilatable.\r\n The tampon or plug has no power to restrain the hemorrhage in such\r\n cases, nor do I know of any other means--either cold, quietness,\r\n or opium--which effectually have, and it is sometimes absolutely\r\n necessary under such circumstances to deliver by turning, before the\r\n hand can possibly be introduced into the uterus without producing\r\n fatal contusion or laceration of the part. I have found in several of\r\n these cases, however, that the delivery may be safely accomplished\r\n by merely passing the hand into the vagina, and afterwards the fore\r\n and middle fingers between the uterus and detached portion of the\r\n placenta, grasping with them the feet, which are generally situated\r\n near the os uteri, and drawing down the inferior extremities into the\r\n vagina, and delivering. I know that the inferior extremities may often\r\n be brought down in this way where it is impossible to pass the whole\r\n hand through the os uteri.\"\r\n\r\nThe same state of things may however result from other causes, and a\r\nvery different mode of proceeding may then be needed, as the doctor\r\nvery clearly shows.\r\n\r\n \"Flooding may take place in the latter months of pregnancy, and during\r\n labor, where the placenta does not adhere to the neck of the uterus,\r\n but to the body or the fundus, and is detached by some external or\r\n internal cause. The separation of the placenta from the upper part\r\n of the uterus may be produced by violence, as blows, falls, pressure\r\n over the hypogastrium, and shocks of various kinds; but it arises much\r\n more frequently from internal causes, of which morbid states of the\r\n placenta, and twisting of the umbilical cord once or oftener round\r\n the neck of the child, are the most common and obvious. This variety\r\n of hemorrhage, though usually termed accidental, can rarely, however,\r\n be referred to accident. Sometimes the flooding occurs to a great\r\n extent without any assignable cause; a large portion of the whole of\r\n the placenta, when in a healthy condition, being suddenly detached\r\n from the uterus, when the patient has been exposed to no external\r\n accident, or injury of any kind, and when no symptoms of increased\r\n determination of blood to the uterus have preceded the attack. When\r\n this happens a large quantity of blood is poured out between the\r\n placenta and uterus, a small portion of which only at the time usually\r\n escapes from the vagina, to indicate what is going on within the\r\n uterus. There may be a great internal hemorrhage, accompanied with\r\n the ordinary constitutional effects resulting from loss of blood--as\r\n faintness, sickness, or vomiting, coldness of the extremities, rapid\r\n feeble pulse, hurried breathing; when there is little or no discharge\r\n from the vagina to excite alarm, or to point out the source of danger,\r\n when it is extreme. It is from the general symptoms of exhaustion, and\r\n by the disagreeable sense of uneasiness, weight, or distension of the\r\n uterus, experienced, and not from the quantity of blood which appears\r\n externally in these cases, that we are led to discover the true state\r\n of the patient--to suspect that internal hemorrhage is going on. But\r\n much more frequently only a small portion of the placenta is at first\r\n detached, and the greater part of the blood which is extravasated\r\n between it and the uterus separates the membranes, and descends by its\r\n weight to the orifice, and escapes through the vagina. In all cases,\r\n however, of uterine hemorrhage in the latter months, the danger cannot\r\n be so accurately estimated by the quantity of blood which appears\r\n externally, as by the general symptoms. The portion of placenta which\r\n is detached, never re-unites to the uterus, but when expelled it is\r\n usually seen covered with a dark coagulum adhering to the uterine\r\n surface.\r\n\r\n \"When the blood escapes in small quantity, and there are no labor\r\n pains present, and no disposition in the os uteri to dilate, and the\r\n constitutional powers are not impaired, an attempt should be made to\r\n prevent a return of the discharge, and the occurrence of labor pains.\r\n For this purpose, if the pulse is full and frequent, some blood may be\r\n taken from the arm, and the patient should be kept in the horizontal\r\n position, surrounded by cool air, cold applications made over the\r\n hypogastrium, and acetate of lead and opium, mineral acids, and other\r\n remedies that diminish the force of the circulation and promote the\r\n coagulation of the blood, should be taken internally. The plug is\r\n here totally inadmissible; it can only convert an external into an\r\n internal hemorrhage. But where the flooding occurs at first profusely,\r\n and is renewed even in a moderate degree, in spite of our efforts to\r\n check it, the continuance of pregnancy to the full period cannot be\r\n expected; it will be of no avail to bleed and administer internal\r\n remedies, except for the purpose of checking the discharge, and thus\r\n averting the immediate danger until the uterus is emptied of its\r\n contents.\r\n\r\n \"The operation of turning, which is required in all cases of complete\r\n placental presentation, is rarely necessary in uterine hemorrhage\r\n where the membranes are felt at the orifice. In a great proportion of\r\n these cases, where, on making an examination, you can feel the smooth\r\n membranes extending across the neck of the uterus, the flooding will\r\n be arrested, and the labor safely completed, if the membranes are\r\n ruptured, the liquor amnii discharged, and contractions of the uterus\r\n excited by gentle dilatation of the orifice, and other appropriate\r\n means. The only cases in which this treatment fails are those in which\r\n it has not been had recourse to sufficiently early, or where the\r\n whole or a large portion of the placenta has been suddenly separated\r\n from the uterus, and a great internal hemorrhage has taken place.\r\n The uterus will not contract effectually in these cases after the\r\n membranes have been ruptured; the pains, instead of becoming stronger,\r\n become more and more feeble, return at longer intervals, and during\r\n these the blood flows more profusely, and death would take place\r\n before delivery, if the child were not extracted by the forceps,\r\n crotchet, or by the operation of turning. In all cases, then, of\r\n uterine hemorrhage in the latter months of pregnancy, and in the first\r\n stage of labor, where the placenta does not present, and the quantity\r\n of blood discharged is so great as to render delivery necessary, where\r\n it appears improbable that the pregnancy can go on longer with safety,\r\n or to the end of the ninth month, rupture of the membrane with the\r\n nail of the forefinger of the right hand, evacuate the liquor amnii\r\n by holding up the head of the child, dilate very gently the os uteri\r\n with the fore and middle fingers expanded, and occasionally make\r\n pressure with the fingers around the whole orifice; apply the binder,\r\n give ergot and stimulants, and the uterus will, in all probability,\r\n contract upon its contents, and expel them without further trouble.\r\n If the hemorrhage should, however, continue after the employment of\r\n these means, delivery must be accomplished by the forceps, craniotomy,\r\n or by turning, according to the peculiarities of the case. In women\r\n who are liable to attacks of flooding after the expulsion of the child\r\n or placenta, rupture the membranes at the commencement of labor, even\r\n before the os uteri is much dilated, if the presentation is natural,\r\n and you will often succeed in entirely preventing hemorrhage.\"\r\n\r\nThe recommendation to bleed may be with good reason objected to, at\r\nleast in the great majority of such cases; and I cannot but think that\r\na timely and persevering use of the ordinary remedies, namely, keeping\r\nquiet, using acid drinks, and cold fomentations to the abdomen, would\r\ndo away with any necessity for it at all. I question very much if ever\r\nbleeding really prevented abortion from flooding, and I cannot but\r\nthink that it has often brought it on sooner. Nevertheless, if all\r\nother means fail to arrest the discharge, and there are no decided\r\nobjections to the contrary, it might be cautiously tried; though the\r\npolicy of taking _more_ blood from a person who is already losing _too\r\nmuch_, is not very evident.\r\n\r\nI have often known the most severe flooding stopped, merely by the\r\nfemale lying on her back, drinking plentifully of lemonade, and\r\napplying cold wet cloths over the abdomen. A small dose of laudanum\r\noccasionally is also useful; and complete rest and tranquillity of\r\n_mind_ is as indispensable as rest of the body. Many females flood\r\nand miscarry merely from worrying and fretting themselves, and from\r\npassion, or strong excitement, _particularly of a certain kind_. This\r\nin short must be carefully avoided, and the patient must live strictly\r\nas if a widow.\r\n\r\nThis accident is likely to occur in subsequent pregnancies, at nearly\r\nthe same time, and should therefore be guarded against by a careful\r\navoidance of all excitement, or violent bodily exertion, during the\r\nwhole time. Keeping the bowels gently open, and practising a regular\r\ndiet, are also requisite. A good supporting bandage is also of frequent\r\nservice. For much more valuable information on this subject however,\r\nI refer to my work on \"_The Diseases of Women_,\" in which it is fully\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nECLAMPSIA, OR CONVULSIONS DURING LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions are to be looked upon as very serious indications of\r\nderangement, during either pregnancy or labor, and are frequently\r\nfollowed by fatal results to both mother and child. They may be of\r\nseveral different kinds, _epileptic_, _hysteric_, or _cataleptic_,\r\nthough the epileptic form is most common. They often occur during\r\npregnancy, but not usually before the seventh month, though\r\noccasionally met with much earlier. According to observations it\r\nappears that there is not above one case of convulsions in six hundred\r\ndeliveries.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of this disease appears to be the strong sympathy\r\nbetween the womb and other organs, owing to which they are continually\r\ndisturbed by the changes it undergoes. Certain temperaments also\r\ndispose to it, particularly the lymphatic, and also dropsy, rickets,\r\nand other diseases. Strong moral impressions may also have a\r\npredisposing effect, such as sudden frights, joy or anger, and also\r\nacute pain, or the dread of it.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, and particularly during pregnancy, the convulsions are\r\npreceded, and indicated, by severe headache, and spasm at the stomach,\r\nwith dimness of sight, bright sparks before the eyes, buzzing in the\r\nears, and partial difficulty in speaking. Occasionally however the fit\r\ncomes on quite suddenly, without any warning whatever.\r\n\r\nThere are few exhibitions of suffering more frightful than one of\r\nthese attacks, and none that call for more prompt and decided action.\r\nIn general females are perfectly helpless when one is attacked in\r\nthis way, and instead of being able and disposed to render proper\r\nassistance, they either run away alarmed, or fall into hysterics\r\nthemselves. It is however of the utmost consequence that the sufferer\r\nshould be attended to instantly, and therefore every female should know\r\nwhat to do in such an emergency, at least till better aid can arrive.\r\n\r\nAt the first commencement of convulsions the features become gradually\r\nfixed, the eyes are expanded and distorted, the breath is drawn with\r\ndifficulty, and all consciousness appears to cease. The body then\r\nbegins to twitch, the mouth opens, usually on one side, the tongue\r\nprotrudes, the head turns on one side, and the blood rushes to it and\r\nthe face in great quantities. In a short time the jaws close again with\r\ngreat force, and the tongue is bitten if proper care has not been taken\r\nto prevent it. At last the eyes began to twinkle, the mouth moves as\r\nif the patient were muttering, and the nostrils expand; the arms are\r\nthrust straight down by the sides of the body, with the hands firmly\r\nclosed; the legs are stiffened straight out, and the body is bent\r\nback like a bow. In short every muscle is affected with spasms, which\r\nare sometimes fearfully violent, and may endure for a considerable\r\ntime. When they subside, the fit gradually terminates and passes off.\r\nDuring the whole time the breathing is difficult, the mouth froths\r\nvery much, and the heart palpitates quickly, but irregularly. When the\r\nspasm is over the patient falls into a perfect stupor, during which\r\nshe remains unconscious, but with all the limbs soft and moveable,\r\nexcept the fingers, which appear to grasp. The jaws generally remain\r\nclosed, and so do the eyes, but they may be easily opened, and will\r\nsometimes remain open; the breathing becomes powerful and loud, and the\r\npulse beats with rapidity. At last slight motions are observed, and\r\nconsciousness gradually returns, but the memory is generally gone for\r\nsome time. This state of stupor usually lasts from ten minutes to half\r\nan hour, but has been known to continue for many hours, or even a whole\r\nday. The spasm seldom continues more than from one to ten minutes,\r\nthough it has lasted for an hour or more.\r\n\r\nThese convulsions might be mistaken for ordinary hysteria by those\r\nnot acquainted with the difference. In hysteria however the female\r\nmoves about and struggles more; she also cries out, and retains both\r\nsensibility and consciousness, so perfectly even sometimes that\r\nshe requests those around to hold her, which is never the case in\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nDuring the stupor it might be supposed, by any one not aware of\r\nthe previous fit, that the patient was suffering from apoplexy, or\r\nintoxication, the appearance being so similar to that exhibited in\r\nthose states. This shows the necessity for careful inquiries as to what\r\nhas previously occurred.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy convulsions generally cause abortion, either by\r\nbringing on uterine contractions or by causing the death of the child.\r\nSome few patients have suffered from them however, and yet gone their\r\nfull time, but this must never be expected. A gradual extinction of\r\nthe vital spark, during the stupor is the ordinary termination, though\r\nsudden death is not unfrequent, during the fit. Gradual recovery is\r\noccasionally witnessed, but seldom without partial loss of memory, or\r\nsome other affliction. Madame Lachapelle says that _one-half_ of the\r\nfemales attacked with convulsions die, and of their children many more.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that the _tendency_ to this fearful affliction\r\nmay be very much lessened in many females, by proper attention to diet\r\nand regimen. Those who are of a full habit, and disposed to headache,\r\nand rush of blood to the head, should live low, and carefully avoid\r\neverything of a heating or stimulating character, and also every kind\r\nof excitement or agitation. The bowels should be kept free, and the\r\nskin well rubbed and kept warm, and the head cool.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--While the patient is in the fit, care must be taken that\r\nshe does not fall off the bed, or bite her tongue, to prevent which\r\nthe jaws must be kept apart, by putting something between, as a piece\r\nof soft wood, or the handle of a spoon covered with cloth, or even a\r\nknotted napkin. The face should be sprinkled with cold water, and the\r\nwhole body well chafed, particularly the hands and feet, which should\r\nalso be made warm as soon as possible. As soon as the spasm is over it\r\nis customary to bleed, either at the arm, or by leeches to the temples\r\nand behind the ears. Mustard poultices should also be applied to the\r\nfeet, and inside the thighs, and an enema should be given of warm water\r\nand a table-spoonful of salt. Ice, or cold water, should be applied\r\nto the head constantly, and if possible the body should be immersed\r\nin a hot bath, which will, in many instances, bring the patient round\r\nimmediately without any other treatment. The bladder should be also\r\nlooked to, as well as the bowels, and if necessary the catheter should\r\nbe used. As soon as she can swallow a few drops of laudanum may be\r\ngiven, or a little ether, but not a full dose by any means.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of bleeding, even in these cases, is denied by many, and\r\nI am almost inclined to think myself, that a prompt and persevering use\r\nof the other remedies mentioned, would be fully as successful without\r\nit. At all events, the fearful mortality in spite of it proves that it\r\nhas not much power, and may well raise a doubt of its utility.\r\n\r\nConvulsions however are so fearful and violent, that few practitioners\r\ncan resist the temptation to bleed, because it seems so well calculated\r\nto give prompt relief; and besides it has popular prejudice in its\r\nfavor. Some authors however assert that it makes the danger greater of\r\nparalysis, and loss of memory, afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhen convulsions occur during pregnancy they seldom cease entirely till\r\nthe uterus is emptied of its contents. It is therefore necessary to\r\nbring on labor, and terminate it as soon as possible, after the parts\r\nare in a proper condition. When they occur during labor it must also\r\nbe finished in the shortest time possible, to afford the best chance\r\nof saving the child, and also because no treatment will prevent the\r\nattack while the patient remains undelivered. All means of bringing\r\non dilatation of the mouth of the womb, mentioned in the article on\r\n_Rigidity_, may be resorted to, excepting _Ergot_, which should never\r\nbe used in these cases.\r\n\r\nM. Chailly tells us, that in thirteen cases of convulsions _nine_ were\r\nfirst pregnancies, and _seven_ of the females were dropsical. Only\r\n_one_ was attacked during pregnancy, _ten_ while in labor, and _two_\r\nafter. Only _two_ died, and _ten_ of the children.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that where pregnant females have had\r\nconvulsions, apparently from living too high, the children have also\r\nhad them after delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE WOMB OR VAGINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRupture of the womb arises from various causes, but most usually from\r\npowerful contractions when the pelvis is small, or the fœtus large, or\r\nwhen it presents unfavorably. It not unfrequently results also from\r\nforce being used, particularly with _instruments_. In fact there is\r\nno doubt but that _numerous_ females die from this accident, brought\r\non by the violence, haste, and want of skill of their attendants. Few\r\ninjuries are more serious, or more beyond the reach of any remedy than\r\nthis, though it is sometimes suffered with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of rupture of the womb are strongly marked, and fearfully\r\nevident. When it occurs, which is most usually during a powerful\r\ncontraction, the female shrieks, and instantly complains of an\r\nagonizing pain over the seat of the rupture; her face grows deadly\r\npale, her pulse falls, and she faints. In general _death_ is almost\r\ninstantaneous, though sometimes life may be preserved for an hour or\r\ntwo, but very seldom. There have even been cases of recovery, but they\r\nare very few, and regarded almost as miracles.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, directly the rupture happens the fœtus escapes through\r\nthe rent into the abdomen, and most of the fluid with it; but sometimes\r\nit still remains in the womb, and then if the liquor amnii is\r\ndischarged there may little or nothing pass through the opening, and\r\nthe danger will be much lessened in consequence. In all cases the only\r\nproceeding which offers any chance of recovery is, _to deliver as soon\r\nas possible_, because when the fœtus is expelled the uterus begins to\r\ncontract, so as to close the wound, and when that is effected, if but\r\nlittle fluid has passed into the cavity of the abdomen, all may yet\r\ngo well. It may frequently happen, when the hand is passed into the\r\nwomb, to turn and deliver, that nothing can be found, the fœtus having\r\npassed through the opening into the abdominal cavity, in which case the\r\nhand must be passed through the opening also, and the fœtus be brought\r\nback if possible. If however the rent is too much closed, or the child\r\ncannot be reached, the _Cesarean_ operation is the only resort.\r\n\r\nM. P. Dubois tells us of a case of this kind which occurred in his\r\nown practice. The female had only been in labor about an hour when\r\nshe uttered a piercing cry, and sank as if suddenly mortally wounded.\r\nThe head of the child, which was previously at the mouth of the womb,\r\ncould not be felt, and on introducing his hand M. Dubois found its feet\r\nwere passed through the opening into the mother's abdomen; he brought\r\nthem back however, and effected delivery by turning with comparative\r\nease. Strange to say this woman was discharged _cured_, in fifteen days\r\nafter, though the uterus was so torn that the intestines had forced\r\nthemselves through the opening into its cavity, and M. D. put them back\r\nwith his hand, which also passed clear into the peritoneal cavity. In\r\nall cases, after the delivery is effected, the womb should be again\r\nexplored, so that if any parts have come through they may be returned\r\nbefore the opening closes, which it may do very soon.\r\n\r\nCases are even mentioned where the child passed clear out of the womb\r\ninto the abdominal cavity, and remained there till absorbed, or\r\nescaped through a fistulous opening many years after; while the wound\r\nhealed up, and otherwise the patient perfectly recovered. Recovery\r\nhowever, in any way, is a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nSome females seem more disposed to this accident than others; possibly\r\nfrom a peculiar tenderness in the substance of the womb. All are\r\nhowever liable to it, and this liability should beget a proper caution\r\nin all manipulations, and forbid uncalled for violence in any way.\r\n\r\nRupture of the vagina is much less serious than rupture of the womb,\r\nunless it occurs at the upper part, when it may give rise to similar\r\nsymptoms and results. At the lower part the danger is much less, though\r\nstill sufficient to excite apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is the same as in the former case. Delivery must be\r\neffected as soon as possible, and the patient kept still and cool to\r\navoid inflammation.\r\n\r\n_It is generally thought that the greater part of these accidents\r\nresult from improper treatment, and particularly from using\r\ninstruments._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS WITH THE HAND AND WITH INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS WITH INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of instruments in effecting delivery is a last resort to save\r\nlife, and ought to be intrusted only to persons of skill; it may\r\ntherefore be thought unnecessary to treat of them in the present work,\r\nand indeed I should not have done so but for the purpose of satisfying\r\nthe natural curiosity of females themselves. The greater part of the\r\ndread they now experience where instruments are needed, arises from\r\nignorance of their nature and mode of action. At the present time\r\nnearly all the instruments used, in competent hands, are comparatively\r\nsafe and harmless, and if females generally understood how they\r\noperated, much less fear would be excited by their use. Years ago, when\r\ncutting and tearing instruments were employed, in nearly every case of\r\ndifficulty, the lamentable results which followed fully justified the\r\nfears experienced, but at the present day such things are seldom seen,\r\nexcept in medical museums, the same purpose being much better effected\r\nby simpler and more harmless apparatus. I wish therefore simply to\r\ngive a brief explanation of the structure, and mode of action, of the\r\ninstruments now chiefly employed, and to show the extent of their\r\napplication and the results which have followed from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORCEPS.\r\n\r\nThe forceps are intended to take hold of the fœtus, and assist us to\r\ndraw it into the world when the natural forces are inadequate, and no\r\nhold can be obtained by the hands. They were first invented about the\r\nyear 1650, by an English surgeon named Chamberlin, who made a secret\r\nof his invention and realized a large fortune from it. Since that time\r\nthey have been modified in various ways, by different practitioners,\r\nbut still remain essentially the same as when first used.\r\n\r\nThe most usual form, and probably the best, is that represented below:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE L.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.       Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of two blades articulated by a button, or screw joint, so\r\nthat they can be easily separated and again adjusted,--Fig. 1. Each\r\nblade is cut out in the middle, and curved, as seen in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe only part to which the forceps are intended to be applied is the\r\nhead, to the dimensions and form of which they are specially adapted.\r\nSome practitioners have used them on the breech, but the practice is\r\nnot generally sanctioned, because they seldom retain their hold on this\r\npart and are nearly sure to seriously injure the child when so applied.\r\nWith properly constructed forceps, rightly applied to the head, there\r\nis but little danger either to the mother or the child; but in the\r\nhands of an unskillful or careless person the consequences of their use\r\nmay be deplorable to both.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark that the forceps are neither\r\n_cutting_ nor _crushing_ instruments, but are simply intended to _lay\r\nhold_, like the hand itself, and enable us to draw down the head, or\r\nchange its position. Most usually they are made long and curved, as\r\nshown in the above plate, but sometimes they are made much shorter\r\nand straight. They may be used upon the head when it is either at the\r\nupper or the lower straits, or while it is in the passage; but on no\r\naccount should they be applied till the parts are fully dilated, and\r\neverything indicates that the child _can_ pass. Thus they should never\r\nbe used when the head is too large, or the pelvis too small, nor when\r\nthere are tumors in the way. In short no attempt should be made with\r\nthem to _force_ the fœtus through a passage which will not admit it\r\nby reasonable efforts. M. Dubois says they should never be used when\r\nthe pelvic diameter is less than _three inches_, because with such\r\ndimensions the child is nearly certain to be crushed to death, and the\r\nmother can scarcely escape serious bruises and lacerations. In like\r\nmanner, if they are thrust into the womb before the mouth of it is\r\nnaturally dilated they are sure to tear and injure it.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary here to give directions for using the forceps in\r\nevery variety of presentation and position, but simply to show the mode\r\nof applying them as they are most frequently required. The two blades\r\nare adjusted separately, one to each side of the head, and then locked\r\ntogether, so that the head is firmly inclosed between them, but not\r\ncrushed. Dr. Denman gives perhaps the best and simplest directions on\r\nthis point, and I therefore quote from his work.\r\n\r\n \"The first part of the operation consists in passing the forefinger\r\n of the right hand behind the ossa pubis and the head of the child to\r\n the ear; then taking the part of the forceps to be first introduced\r\n by the handle in the left hand, the point of the blade is to be\r\n slowly conducted between the head of the child and the finger till\r\n the instrument touches the ear: there can be no difficulty or hazard\r\n in carrying the instrument thus far, because it will be guided, and\r\n in some measure shielded, by the finger. But the further introduction\r\n must be made with a slow semi-rotatory motion, keeping the point of\r\n the blade not rigidly, yet closely, to the head of the child, by\r\n raising the handle toward the pubes. In this manner the blade must\r\n be carried gently along the head till the lock reaches the external\r\n parts near the anterior angle of the pudendum. The point of the blade,\r\n while introducing, sometimes hitches upon the ear of the child, and\r\n it then requires a little elevation. But when it has passed the ear,\r\n and is beyond the guidance of the finger, should there be any check\r\n to the introduction either of this or the other blade, it should\r\n be withdrawn a little, to give us an opportunity of discovering\r\n the cause of the obstacle, which we must never strive to overcome\r\n by violence, though we must proceed with firmness. When the first\r\n blade is properly introduced, it must be held steadily in its place\r\n by pressing the handle towards the pubes, and it will be a guide in\r\n the introduction and application of the second blade. Let the second\r\n blade be introduced in this manner. Keep the blade first introduced\r\n in its place with the two lesser fingers of the left hand, and carry\r\n the fore-finger of the same hand between the perineum and head of the\r\n child as high as you can reach. Then take the second blade of the\r\n forceps by the handle in the right hand, and, conveying the point\r\n between the finger placed within the perineum and the head of the\r\n child, conduct the instrument, with the precautions before mentioned,\r\n so far that the lock shall touch the interior part of the perineum, or\r\n even press it a little backwards. In order to fix the two blades thus\r\n introduced, that which was placed towards the pubes must be slowly\r\n withdrawn, and carried so far backwards that it can be locked with the\r\n second blade retained in its first position; and care must be taken\r\n that nothing be entangled in the lock, by passing the finger round it.\r\n When the forceps are locked, it will be convenient to tie the handles\r\n together with sufficient firmness to prevent them from sliding or\r\n changing their position when they are not held in the hand, but not\r\n in such a manner as to increase the compression upon the head of the\r\n child. Should the blades of the forceps be introduced so as not to be\r\n opposite each other, they could not be locked; or if, when applied,\r\n the handles should come close together, or be at a great distance from\r\n each other, they would probably slip, or there would be a failure\r\n of some kind in the operation, as the bulk of the head would not be\r\n included, or they would be fixed on some improper part of the head;\r\n though allowance is to be made for the difference in the size of the\r\n heads of children. But if a case be proper for the forceps, if they be\r\n well applied, and we were to act slowly with them, there would not be\r\n much risk of failure or disappointment. The difficulty of applying the\r\n forceps is most frequently occasioned by attempting to apply them too\r\n soon, or by passing them in a wrong direction, or by entangling the\r\n soft parts of the mother between the instrument and the head of the\r\n child, against all which accidents we are to be on our guard.\r\n\r\n \"When the forceps are first locked, they are placed backwards, with\r\n the lock close to, or just within, the internal surface of the\r\n perineum; and they can have no support backwards, except the little\r\n which is afforded by the soft parts. The first action with them\r\n should therefore be made by bringing the handles, grasped firmly in\r\n one or both hands, to prevent the instrument from playing upon the\r\n head of the child, slowly towards the pubes till they come to a full\r\n rest. Having waited a short interval with them in that situation, the\r\n handles must be carried back in the same slow but steady manner to the\r\n perineum, exerting, as they are carried in the different situations,\r\n a certain degree of extracting force; and after waiting another\r\n interval, they are again to be carried towards the pubes, according\r\n to the direction of the handles. Throughout the operation, especially\r\n the first part, the action of that blade of the forceps originally\r\n applied towards the pubes must be stronger and more extensive than\r\n the action with the other blade, this having no fulcrum to support\r\n it, and chiefly answering the purpose of regulating the action of\r\n the other blade. If there were any labor pains when the operation\r\n was begun, or should they come on in the course of it, the forceps\r\n should only be acted with during the continuance of the pains; the\r\n intention being, not only to supply the want or insufficiency of the\r\n pains, but to follow them, and imitate also the manner in which they\r\n return. By a few repetitions of this alternate action and rest before\r\n described, we shall soon be sensible of the descent of the head; and\r\n it will be proper to examine very frequently, to know the progress\r\n made, that we may not use more force than needful, nor go on with\r\n more haste than may be expedient or safe. In every case we ought to\r\n proceed slowly and circumspectly, not forgetting that a small degree\r\n of force, continued for a long time, will in general be equivalent to\r\n a greater force hastily exerted, and with infinitely less detriment to\r\n the mother or child. But after some time, should we not perceive the\r\n head to descend, the force hitherto used must be gradually increased,\r\n till it be sufficient to overcome the obstacles to the delivery of the\r\n patient. It was before observed, as the head of the child descended,\r\n that the face would be accordingly turned towards the hollow of the\r\n sacrum, without any aim or assistance on our part. Of course the\r\n position of the handles of the forceps, and the direction in which we\r\n ought to act with them, should alter; for they becoming first more\r\n diagonal or oblique with respect to the pelvis, and then more and more\r\n lateral, every change in their position will require a differently\r\n directed action, because the handles should ever be antagonists to\r\n each other. In proportion also to the descent of the head the handles\r\n of the forceps should approach nearer to the pubes; so that, in the\r\n beginning of the operation, though we acted in the direction of the\r\n cavity of the pelvis, towards the conclusion we should act in that\r\n of the vagina. When we feel that we have the command of the head, by\r\n its being cleared of the pelvis, and the external parts begin to be\r\n distended, we ought to act yet more slowly, especially in the case\r\n of a first child, or there would be great danger of a laceration\r\n of the soft parts; and this can only be prevented by acting very\r\n deliberately in the direction of the vagina--by giving the parts time\r\n to distend--by duly supporting the perineum, which is the part chiefly\r\n in danger, with the palm of the hand--by soothing and moderating the\r\n hurry and efforts of the patient--and, in some cases, by absolutely\r\n resisting for a certain time the passage of the head through the\r\n external parts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LI.\r\n\r\n_The head being drawn through a narrow Pelvis by the Forceps._\r\n\r\n The manner in which the forceps draw the head is well shown in the\r\n above plate, and also the compression of the head itself, which is\r\n seen to be squeezed almost to a point at its presenting part. This\r\n compression, however, is not likely to do serious injury, unless it be\r\n excessive. The child may be convulsed a little from it, but usually\r\n recovers, and suffers nothing afterwards.]\r\n\r\nIt is merely necessary to remark, in conclusion, that the forceps\r\nshould never be used till it is manifestly impossible for the child to\r\nbe born without them; and it should be remembered that nature alone\r\nfrequently effects delivery under the most unfavorable circumstances,\r\nby giving her time. We should wait therefore as long as the safety of\r\nthe mother will allow, but never delay a moment when that safety is\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nThe accidents which have followed from the use of the forceps are\r\nnumerous and terrible, and I could give a most horrifying account of\r\nthem if it were necessary. It must be recollected however, that these\r\naccidents have chiefly followed from want of skill in managing the\r\ninstrument, or from its being used under improper circumstances. It is\r\ntrue that there is always more or less of pain and injury to be dreaded\r\nfrom the forceps, even in the most favorable cases, and with the most\r\ncompetent operators, but this is no argument against their employment\r\naltogether. In every case where they are really called for, the female\r\nwould, most probably, die undelivered, or have to be cut open, so that\r\nit is simply a choice of evils, of which the forceps are the least.\r\n\r\nThe cases in which the forceps are absolutely necessary however, are\r\nVERY RARE, much more so in fact than many people suppose. _Patience_,\r\nand the persevering use of ordinary assistance, would probably succeed\r\nalone in half the cases where they are now employed.\r\n\r\nIn Murphy's lectures on _difficult Labors_, he gives us some valuable\r\nstatistics on this subject. He tells us that in _seventy-five thousand\r\nnine hundred and eleven labors_, the forceps were used only _one\r\nhundred and thirty-eight times_, or once in every _five hundred\r\nand fifty_ labors. In these one hundred and thirty-eight cases\r\n_thirty-five_ of the children died, and _ten_ of the mothers. Dr.\r\nMurphy however, thinks that the general results, to both mother and\r\nchild, would be equally favorable if the forceps were _not used at\r\nall_, and he gives the tables of Dr. Collins to support his opinions.\r\nFrom these tables it really appears that, when all the difficult labors\r\nwere left entirely to nature, the number of deaths was _just about\r\nthe same as when the forceps are used_, in fact _rather less_, while\r\nthe accidents, and subsequent evils, were not nearly so great. Dr.\r\nM. therefore thinks that the forceps should _never_ be used, except\r\nin a few cases where everything is quite favorable to the passage of\r\nthe fœtus; and the uterus _cannot_ be made, in a reasonable time, to\r\ncontract and expel it; and also when _immediate_ delivery is needed\r\nto save the mother's life, as in flooding. In cases of mere ordinary\r\ndifficulty or delay, he decries their use entirely; and he evidently\r\nthinks that when the labor is _fit_ to be terminated by the forceps,\r\nnature can and will terminate it herself if left alone. There is no\r\ndoubt but that they are now used a great deal _too much_, either from\r\na desire to _operate_, or from _want of patience_; and I have no\r\nhesitation in expressing my opinion that more have been _killed_ than\r\n_saved_ by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nRespecting other instruments, such as the _Crotchet_, the _Vectis_, and\r\nthe _Cephalotribe_, or _crushing forceps_, it is not necessary to say\r\nanything here, as their use, when imperatively needed, must necessarily\r\nbe confined to the surgeon; and fortunately may now be dispensed with\r\naltogether. The recently introduced practice of bringing on _premature\r\nlabor_, in all cases of deformity or smallness of the pelvis, entirely\r\nobviates the necessity for any of these dreadful resorts, if the\r\ndifficulty be known in time, which it is sure to be when a sufficient\r\ndegree of knowledge is disseminated.\r\n\r\nThe _Cesarian operation_, or cutting open the womb externally; and\r\n_Cephalotomy_, or the opening of the child's head, may also be\r\ndismissed with the same observations. _They can always be avoided_, if\r\nthe real condition of the patient is known in time; and if from neglect\r\nnothing else can be done, they must always be performed by a skillful\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS WITH THE HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNING.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most useful operations that the accoucheur can\r\nperform, in many cases, and has the advantage of being altogether\r\naccomplished _by the hand_. Its object is to change the presentation,\r\nwhen unfavorable, and to facilitate delivery. Most usually the hand is\r\nintroduced into the uterus, and the _feet_ are brought down. This is\r\ncalled _pelvic version_; but sometimes the head is brought to the mouth\r\nof the womb, particularly in shoulder presentations, and this is called\r\n_cephalic version_.\r\n\r\n_Cephalic Version._--This can seldom be performed, and not often\r\nattempted with safety. In some cases however, when it is ascertained\r\nthat the shoulder presents, and before the membranes are broken, an\r\neffort may be made to remove it and bring the head in its place. To\r\ndo this the position of the head must be ascertained externally, and\r\none hand placed upon it; then with the two forefingers of the other\r\nraise up the shoulder from within, as in ballotment, and endeavor to\r\npush the head into its place. If the child be very moveable this may\r\nsometimes be done, and will be highly advantageous; but most frequently\r\nthe substitution cannot be accomplished, and the attempt ruptures the\r\nmembranes, after which it is still more difficult, and even becomes\r\ndangerous. Even if the head be brought down there is always danger of\r\nits becoming displaced, and the shoulder again presented, owing to\r\nthe tendency which any presentation has to be reproduced. To prevent\r\nthis the hand should be firmly pressed on the fœtus, externally, as\r\nsoon as the head is brought down, to fix it; and the membranes should\r\nbe ruptured so that it may begin to descend, after which there is no\r\ndanger of a change.\r\n\r\nCephalic version can be so seldom performed however, and is so\r\ndifficult, and sometimes dangerous, that it is seldom or never\r\nattempted; more particularly as pelvic version can always be\r\nsubstituted, and is more easy and safe. It is true that presentations\r\nof the head are the most favorable, providing they occur before the\r\nrupture of the membranes, but after that event they may not be so\r\nfavorable as those of the lower extremities, and certainly are not so\r\neasy or safe to induce.\r\n\r\n_Pelvic Version._--Turning to bring down the feet is performed for\r\nvarious reasons, and under many different circumstances. As a general\r\nprinciple we may say that it is done either to change the presentation,\r\nwhen unfavorable, or to terminate the labor when it is lingering,\r\nor when it is desirable to have it over as quickly as possible. The\r\nfeet may be drawn through the mouth of the Womb when it is but little\r\nopened, and when they have once passed, the limbs and body soon follow,\r\nand the head seldom remains long behind. The fœtus may in fact be\r\ncompared to a _wedge_, of which the feet are the point, and if they\r\nenter the passage the rest part is gradually driven after by the\r\nuterine contractions.\r\n\r\nThe chief contingencies which call for the operation of turning are, a\r\nprotracted labor, a presentation of the placenta, causing hemorrhage,\r\nand a wrong presentation, particularly one of the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe operation of turning is very clearly explained by Dr. Lee, and I\r\nknow from experience that his directions can be safely relied upon.\r\nIt very frequently happens however, that there will be some peculiar\r\ncircumstances in a case, which will necessitate more or less change\r\nin the manner of proceeding, so that the practitioner must after all\r\nbe guided, to a great extent, by the requirements and conditions then\r\nexisting. Dr. Lee's directions therefore, must merely be considered as\r\n_general_ ones, to be modified as occasion may require:--\r\n\r\n \"When the operation of turning is required before the membranes are\r\n ruptured, and when the orifice of the uterus is widely dilated, and\r\n there are long intervals between the pains, it is accompanied with\r\n little difficulty and danger. Having explained to the patient and\r\n her relatives the nature of the case, let her lie on the left side\r\n near the edge of the bed, with the knees drawn up to the abdomen. Sit\r\n down by the side of the bed, and quietly take off your coat; lay bare\r\n your right arm by turning up the shirt above the elbow, and cover\r\n the back of the hand and the whole forearm with cold cream, lard,\r\n or a solution of soap. Introduce one finger after another into the\r\n vagina, and slowly and effectually dilate its orifice. The hand, in a\r\n conical form, and in a state of half supination, must then be pressed\r\n steadily forward with a semi-rotatory motion against the perineum and\r\n sides of the passage, till it clears the orifice of the vagina. This\r\n should always be done very slowly and gently, as it is accompanied\r\n with great pain. Let the hand remain some time in the orifice of\r\n the vagina, that it may be fully dilated, and offer no resistance\r\n in the subsequent steps of the operation of turning. When the hand\r\n has dilated the vagina sufficiently, in the absence of pain gently\r\n insinuate the points of the fingers and thumb into the os uteri in a\r\n conical form; and if it is not sufficiently open to allow the hand to\r\n pass, you must proceed next to use artificial dilatation here also,\r\n very gently and slowly, always stopping as soon as a pain comes on,\r\n but not withdrawing the fingers altogether at the time from the os\r\n uteri. Having succeeded in dilating the part without rupturing the\r\n membranes, slide the hand up between the membranes and the anterior\r\n part of the uterus into the cavity, and grasp the feet when the\r\n membranes give way. Most frequently the membranes burst as the hand is\r\n entering the uterus, before it reaches the feet, and the liquor amnii\r\n rushes out and is lost, if it is not prevented by pressing the hand\r\n forward firmly into the orifice. Never be contented with one foot when\r\n it is possible to grasp both; and this can always be done when the\r\n liquor amnii has not escaped, and the uterus is not closely contracted\r\n round the body of the child. Seize both feet and legs, and when\r\n there is no pain, draw them down into the vagina; and as the nates\r\n descend through the os uteri, the shoulder and arm will gradually\r\n recede or be retracted, and will offer no obstacle to the remaining\r\n part of the operation, which should be completed as if the nates and\r\n inferior extremities had originally presented, and which has already\r\n been very fully described. In actual practice, except in twin cases,\r\n the membranes have been ruptured and the liquor amnii is gone, in a\r\n great proportion of cases--in about ten to one--long before we are\r\n called upon to deliver by turning, and the operation is then a much\r\n more serious affair. Sometimes, when the os uteri is half dilated,\r\n there is an interval of freedom from pain for several hours after the\r\n rupture of the membranes, and partial escape of the liquor amnii. Here\r\n it is advisable to turn without delay; and the hand can be passed up\r\n into the uterus and the feet brought down with little more difficulty\r\n than if the membranes had not been ruptured.\"\r\n\r\nThe operation of turning is however beset with many difficulties, and\r\nunless the conditions for it are very favorable, and the operator\r\nskillful, it may cause greater mischief than it is intended to remedy.\r\nThe probability is, as in the case of other operations, that it would\r\nseldom or never be needed if proper means were used in time, and\r\nperseveringly; and it is yet a question whether the prospect, for both\r\nmother and child, would not be more favorable if the delivery was\r\nalways left to nature, in those cases where version is now attempted.\r\nDr. Collins says, \"As to turning, the risk to the mother is, in the\r\nmajority of cases, so great as to forbid its employment, nor do I think\r\nthe practitioner justified by the circumstances in so greatly hazarding\r\nhis patient's life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF WOMEN DURING PREGNANCY, AND IN CHILD-BED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen are liable during pregnancy, and after childbirth, to most of\r\nthe diseases which afflict them at other times, and also to many\r\nderangements peculiar to those periods. As a general rule either of\r\nthose conditions somewhat modifies the disease, and also necessitates\r\ncertain differences in its treatment. My former work on the _Diseases\r\nof Women_ having treated on all those affections common to every other\r\nperiod, I shall in this confine myself chiefly to those peculiar to\r\nthe two conditions referred to; giving their causes, symptoms, and\r\ntreatment, with practical hints for their prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diseases which are found during pregnancy are of two kinds; the\r\nfirst kind called _Sympathetic_, or nervous, consist of various\r\nderangements of different parts of the system, produced chiefly by\r\nnervous sympathy with the Womb. The second kind, called _Idiopathic_,\r\nare real primary derangements of the Generative Organs themselves, or\r\nof those intimately connected with them. Each of these kinds will be\r\ntreated of separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETIC DISEASES OCCURRING DURING PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSICKNESS AND VOMITING.\r\n\r\nNausea, or sickness, with or without vomiting, is one of the most\r\nfrequent and troublesome accompaniments of pregnancy. It is so general,\r\nin fact, as to be looked upon as one of the earliest and most reliable\r\nsigns of that state. It is undoubtedly caused, in the earlier stages,\r\nsimply by the intimate sympathy which exists between the stomach and\r\nwomb, and which causes one of those organs to be temporarily deranged\r\nwhenever the other is in any unusual condition. In the latter months\r\nit is also produced by the enlarged womb pressing on the lower part\r\nof the stomach, as it rises in the abdomen. In many diseases of the\r\nwomb, particularly in enlargements, and tumors, the stomach will become\r\nderanged in precisely the same manner as during pregnancy, and the\r\npatient is frequently deceived thereby as to her real condition.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the sickness does not begin till about the second month,\r\nand it seldom lasts beyond the third or fourth. There are some however,\r\nwith whom it commences almost immediately after fecundation, and others\r\nwith whom it lasts till the very commencement of labor. I have even\r\nknown persons who always experienced the nausea _at the very moment of\r\nconception_, and who were thus aware when that event took place. With\r\nsome persons the trouble occurs only during certain parts of the day,\r\nmost usually in the morning, while with others it comes on irregularly,\r\nor even endures constantly. In most cases it is not very severe, and\r\ncauses but little distress; occasionally however, it is very serious,\r\nand may even lead to fatal results, in spite of all that can be done.\r\nAbortion is frequently brought on by it; and so are faintings, and\r\nspitting of blood. Many women however, will vomit with violence, during\r\nalmost the whole period, without either accident or evil effect. The\r\ntreatment must vary according to the cause of the derangement, its\r\nviolence, and the effect it produces. In regard to diet but little can\r\nbe said that will be found generally applicable. Mild and light food\r\nis generally recommended, but is not always the best, for some females\r\ncan only keep on their stomachs the most indigestible articles. Perhaps\r\nnothing more can be said, with propriety, than that the patient should\r\ntake _whatever she can retain_, particularly if she has become weak\r\nfrom want of nourishment, which is often the case. Some females can\r\nonly keep down a little broth, or tea, or sweetened water, while others\r\nfind solid food the best, or fruits. I have known many able to take\r\n_Gum Arabic_, either solid or dissolved in water, and retain it, when\r\nnothing else could be borne. This is nourishing, and may often keep up\r\nthe strength till the sickness abates.\r\n\r\nThere are many remedies that will sometimes relieve, though frequently\r\nthey are of no use whatever. A little wine or brandy, or orange flower\r\nwater;--a few drops of laudanum, or ether, or essence of peppermint,\r\nmay be tried. One or two ipecac, or cayenne, or camphor lozenges,\r\nwill sometimes be efficacious, and so will a little Port wine and\r\nPeruvian bark, or a seidlitz powder, or even common soda water. A\r\ntea-spoonful of powdered charcoal succeeds occasionally, or some very\r\nstrong bitters, or a cordial, such as a wine-glassful of curacoa. A\r\nplaster of opium may also be placed over the stomach, or one of meal\r\nwet with laudanum. A mustard poultice over the stomach, will frequently\r\nrelieve when everything else fails;--sometimes it is more effective\r\nhowever, when placed on the spine, opposite the stomach. As a general\r\nrule the bowels should be kept free, either with injections or with\r\nmild purgatives, as castor oil, or manna. _Regular bathing_ will\r\noften act as a complete preventive or cure, and the vomiting may be\r\nfrequently stopped by simply dashing cold water over the stomach. Some\r\npractitioners recommend _emetics_, and bleeding if the patient be of\r\na full plethoric habit. Leeches and cups have also been used over the\r\nstomach, and sometimes with good effect. Ether and chloroform have also\r\nbeen inhaled, and have operated favorably in a few instances. Plentiful\r\ndraughts of cold water, or swallowing bits of ice will likewise afford\r\nrelief to some.\r\n\r\nIn several instances the vomiting has been so violent, and the patient\r\nhas suffered so much, and become so exhausted from want of nourishment,\r\nthat it has been absolutely necessary, after all other means have\r\nfailed, to cause miscarriage, as the only means of saving the patient's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhenever the trouble _can_ be borne, _Patience_ is the grand specific.\r\nThe sufferer must recollect that it will surely cease with delivery,\r\nand most probably before.\r\n\r\n\r\nPTYALISM, OR EXCESSIVE SALIVATION.\r\n\r\nSome pregnant females will secrete an immense amount of saliva for\r\nweeks and months in succession, as if they had been salivated. I have\r\nnever known a case in which this discharge caused any evil, even when\r\nvery great, though it is often troublesome. It would probably not be\r\njudicious to stop it, even if we could do so, as long as it does no\r\nharm, though it may be advisable at times to moderate it. The only\r\ntreatment proper to effect this is, to keep the bowels free and the\r\nbody well bathed, and to gargle the mouth with mint or balm teas, or\r\ncanella water, or a little syrup of poppies.\r\n\r\nThis discharge, like the vomiting, arises from the sympathetic action\r\nof the uterus, and it generally ceases about the fourth month, though\r\nwith some it will last the whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\nODONTALGIA, OR TOOTHACHE.\r\n\r\nThis is also a very general trouble during pregnancy, and sometimes a\r\nvery severe one. Like several other sympathetic affections it is very\r\nirregular as to its first appearance and duration, some suffering from\r\nit most of the time, almost without intermission, while others only\r\nhave it at intervals, and but slightly.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes depends upon unsound teeth, but is frequently experienced\r\nwithout any such cause, and is then a true _neuralgia_. When it arises\r\nfrom a bad tooth, the pain is usually confined more or less to the\r\nneighborhood of the tooth, but when it is neuralgic it extends over the\r\ngreater part or the whole of the jaw and face, and darts about from\r\none part to another. In true toothache there is also usually more or\r\nless inflammation and swelling, while in the most agonizing neuralgia\r\nnothing of the kind can be seen.\r\n\r\nThe treatment must be regulated by circumstances. If the pain appears\r\nto be kept up by an unsound tooth, it should by all means be extracted,\r\nunless the patient be so exceedingly nervous and irritable that\r\nabortion is to be feared, in which case the pain must be alleviated as\r\nwell as it can be, though there is almost as much danger in leaving the\r\ntooth in such cases as in extracting it. A few leeches to the gums will\r\nsometimes relieve, or a mustard poultice to the cheek, or a blister\r\nbehind the ear. The stomach or bowels being out of order may also keep\r\nup the irritation, and regulating them may materially assist in giving\r\nrelief. Some persons are relieved by lotions of camphor, or laudanum,\r\nand others by washes of cayenne tea, or alum water. In the neuralgic\r\nform, when no particular tooth can be found in fault, the treatment\r\nmust be more general than local. The _Carbonate of Iron Pills_, which\r\ncan be purchased at the druggists ready made, have frequently an\r\nexcellent effect; from two to four may be taken at a dose, twice a\r\nday, the bowels being kept open, if necessary, by a little tincture of\r\nrhubarb. If the pain comes at regular intervals, or intermits, it may\r\nfrequently be stopped by quinine. _Two_ of the ordinary _quinine pills_\r\nmay be taken every _five hours_, for two or three days. If the head\r\nfeels oppressed by their use, the dose must be lessened to _one_. M.\r\nGuillemeau recommends the following to be tried if other means fail,\r\nand I have known it to be of decided benefit. Take the whites of _two\r\neggs_, and _two ounces of common black pepper_, in powder, and beat\r\nthem well together. Spread this on some tow or cotton, and lay it on\r\nthe cheek. It may be kept on till it causes considerable irritation,\r\nand sometimes may be used on both sides.\r\n\r\nSome females have been relieved by bathing the face in _cold_ water, or\r\nkeeping _ice_ in the mouth, and others by hot fomentations. It has also\r\nbeen recommended to fill the mouth with cold water, and bathe the cheek\r\nwith hot at the same time!\r\n\r\nOccasionally an abscess, or gum boil will form, and when there seems a\r\ntendency to that it may be promoted by keeping a roasted fig in between\r\nthe cheek and gum, over the part where the abscess points; when full,\r\nit should be lanced, as the discharge usually gives relief.\r\n\r\nThis pain is however very obstinate sometimes, and defies all\r\ntreatment, but is seldom of such long duration when so severe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERANGEMENTS OF THE APPETITE.\r\n\r\nThe powerful sympathetic action of the womb on the stomach produces not\r\nonly nausea and vomiting, but various derangements of the appetite and\r\ntaste also. All of these require notice, and some need attention.\r\n\r\n_Anorexia._--This means a complete distaste, or even disgust, for food,\r\nsometimes of particular articles only, and sometimes for those of every\r\nkind. It seldom lasts beyond the fourth month, but occasionally during\r\nthe whole period. It is remarkable how some females will be affected in\r\nthis way, and how little they will eat, for several months together.\r\nThis however is scarcely ever of any consequence, for the system does\r\nnot seem to suffer in the slightest degree; on the contrary, the\r\nmother will remain quite stout, and the child be born fully developed,\r\nthough the quantity of food taken has apparently been scarcely\r\nsufficient to sustain life.\r\n\r\nIn many cases there is even a decided benefit from this state of\r\nthings, particularly in those who are of a too full habit.\r\n\r\nAs long as the loss of appetite is merely of a sympathetic or nervous\r\ncharacter it is not necessary nor advisable to resort to any special\r\ntreatment. But when it arises from indigestion, or a foul stomach, it\r\nis necessary to attend to it. A mild emetic of ipecac or warm mustard\r\nand water, may be given, or a dose of Epsom Salts. This state will be\r\nrecognized by a furred tongue, unpleasant breath, and uneasiness at the\r\npit of the stomach; while in the purely nervous anorexia nothing of the\r\nkind is observed. Sometimes it may arise merely from debility of the\r\nstomach, and in that case a few of the _Carbonate of Iron Pills_ will\r\nbe of use. In general the patient is benefited rather than injured by\r\nthis voluntary fasting.\r\n\r\n_Boulimia._--This state is the reverse of the former, meaning a\r\nravenous appetite. Some females exhibit it in a most extraordinary\r\ndegree, and will eat to excess of anything that comes in their way.\r\nMany injure themselves in this manner, by causing indigestion,\r\nflatulence, heartburn, vomiting, and even inflammation of the stomach.\r\nIt is of no use reasoning with them, for the appetite is so strong that\r\nthey will eat let them suffer ever so much.\r\n\r\nAll that can be done in such cases is, to drink freely of various\r\nnourishing liquids, such as soup, broth, rice milk, or chocolate; and\r\nby eating jelly, arrow-root, and eggs. These contain much nourishment\r\nin a small space, and satisfy the hunger without overloading the\r\nstomach. The appetite may also be deadened considerably by eating figs,\r\ndates, sugar, or chocolate; and by drinking soda water.\r\n\r\n_Capricious Appetite._--Sometimes a female is found to have an\r\ninordinate desire for some one particular article of diet, which she\r\nwill eat to excess, but will not touch anything else; this is called\r\n_malacia_. Others will have a craving for some article not proper for\r\nfood;--this is called _Pica_. They will devour chalk, cinders, earth,\r\nwood, flies, spiders, charcoal, and various other things, sometimes\r\nof the most disgusting kind, though ordinarily they may be quite\r\nfastidious in their diet. This unnatural desire is also frequently seen\r\nin hysteria and chlorosis, and in several uterine diseases.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that a moderate indulgence of these unusual tastes\r\nis at all injurious, unless the article wished for be of a decidedly\r\nhurtful character. On the contrary, it is reasonably conjectured, by\r\nmany physiologists, that they arise from a real want in the system of\r\nthe very substances longed for. For instance, there may not be in the\r\nmother's blood sufficient _lime_ to form the bones of the child, and\r\nthis deficiency is intimated by her desire for chalk or plaster; nature\r\nhaving no other mode of making her wants known, or of causing them\r\nto be supplied. As a general rule, so long as the indulgence is not\r\nobviously improper, it should be allowed to a reasonable extent, both\r\nto gratify the patient and to answer to what are probably the demands\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that interference is needed in these cases, except when\r\nthere is danger of the patient doing herself harm; we may then try to\r\nalter the condition of the stomach, and so change the taste. A gentle\r\nemetic will sometimes do this, or a saline purgative. If these fail use\r\na few of the _Carbonate of Iron Pills_, or some good strong bitters, or\r\nteas, drunk freely, such as Cammomile, Boneset or Centaury.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYROSIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease is more frequently called _water brash_ and sometimes\r\n_heart burn_. It is characterized by the raising of a hot acrid fluid\r\ninto the throat, causing a sensation of burning from the stomach\r\nupward, even to the mouth. It is a very frequent attendant upon many\r\nforms of dyspepsia, and is generally experienced more or less by most\r\npregnant females, arising either from improper diet or from mere\r\nsympathetic derangement. If it arises only from errors of diet, a\r\nreform in that particular is all that is needed, but if it is merely\r\nsympathetic nothing can be done beyond palliating it, to give temporary\r\nrelief. For this purpose the patient must take a spoonful of lime\r\nwater, in half a tumbler of milk two or three times a day, or some\r\ncarbonate of soda, or magnesia, with a few drops of laudanum if there\r\nbe any pain. In those cases which resist such remedies a little of the\r\n_compound iron mixture_ may be of service, such as can be obtained at\r\nthe druggists. A nourishing diet should also be observed, and plenty of\r\nexercise should be taken in the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPHAGIA.\r\n\r\nDifficulty of swallowing, which is meant by this term, is a more\r\ntroublesome and alarming affection, frequently attendant on pregnancy.\r\nThere is however nothing dangerous in it, except that it frightens\r\nthe patient. Some will gasp and be unable to swallow, or even speak,\r\nfor a considerable time, and will think they have something in the\r\nthroat. It is however entirely a nervous symptom, arising from uterine\r\nirritation, and seldom lasts beyond the third or fourth month. A little\r\ncordial, wine, or brandy, will frequently relieve it, or some spirits\r\nof camphor rubbed on the neck. M. Colombat d'l'Isere recommends the\r\nfollowing ointment, to be rubbed on the neck. Extract of Belladonna\r\nforty-seven grains,--Extract of Strammonium fifteen grains,--white wax\r\none ounce,--oil of lemons twelve drops.--These must be warmed and well\r\nrubbed together. A dash of cold water on the throat and chest will\r\noften succeed better than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTRALGIA.\r\n\r\nThis is commonly termed cramp at the stomach, or nervous colic.\r\nIt consists of a severe kind of cramp, with dragging and cutting\r\nsensations in the stomach, as if it were being tied in knots and cut to\r\npieces. Sometimes the attack will only last for a few minutes, and then\r\ntotally pass away, at other times it will remain for half an hour or\r\nmore, and cause the most intense suffering. The patient will be drawn\r\ntogether, or doubled up, with her hands placed on her stomach, and will\r\ngroan and exhibit in her features the greatest agony; sometimes even,\r\nshe will faint away with it.\r\n\r\nThis affection may, like the others, be merely nervous, and then it\r\nis attended by nothing but the pain. It may also arise from real\r\ninflammation of the stomach, and then it is attended by fever,\r\nexcessive soreness and tenderness of the stomach when touched, and by\r\na hot, dry mouth. In the nervous spasm the pain is frequently relieved\r\nby pressure, but when inflammation exists the pressure increases it.\r\n\r\nSome females always have these attacks whenever the stomach is empty,\r\nand they pass away immediately anything is taken to eat or drink. With\r\nothers they are often brought on by overloading the stomach, or by\r\neating some improper articles.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the spasm, one of the best things is a _tea-spoonful of\r\nCompound Spirits of Lavender_, taken without water. This nearly\r\nalways gives relief in ten minutes at most; but if necessary a second\r\nspoonful may be taken in a quarter of an hour. A little brandy, or\r\npeppermint, or curacoa cordial will also succeed in many instances,\r\nor simply drinking freely of any hot tea, or swallowing half a\r\ntea-spoonful of common pepper. A mustard plaster put on hot over the\r\nstomach will scarcely ever fail, even without anything being taken\r\ninternally. M. Colombat gives the following recipe as one which he\r\nhas found efficacious, and it is certainly a pleasant one. Orange and\r\nLinden Flower waters each two ounces; Syrup of Ether and of Valerian\r\neach one ounce; Syrup of Poppy heads half an ounce. Of this mixture a\r\ntea-spoonful may be given every quarter of an hour till the pain abates.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the return of the attack, the patient must carefully avoid\r\neverything that disagrees with the stomach, or creates wind; she must\r\nkeep the bowels free, and accustom herself to regular bathing or\r\nrubbing the body. If the stomach appear weak, which is often the case,\r\nsome Boneset tea, or Port wine and bark, or a few of the Carbonate of\r\nIron Pills may be advantageous. If there be acid on the stomach, use\r\nthe means recommended for heartburn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common trouble with pregnant females, and one that may\r\nlead to many others. Very frequently it arises merely from the pressure\r\nof the expanded uterus upon the large intestine, but it may also arise\r\nfrom a simple want of power, the uterine action having apparently\r\nweakened the force of all the neighboring organs. It is advisable to\r\ncorrect it as soon as possible, let it arise how it may, as it is very\r\napt to cause various derangements of the stomach and intestines, and\r\neven inflammation of the womb itself. As a general rule, not more than\r\nthree days should elapse without the bowels being moved, though some\r\nwill remain a week or more without any apparent inconvenience; but\r\nthere is always danger in such delay.\r\n\r\nMany females do themselves much harm by taking what they call opening\r\nmedicines, the action of which is often more injurious than the\r\nconstipation itself. All drastic purgatives, such as aloes, gamboge,\r\ncolocynth, and jalap should be carefully avoided, as they not only\r\nmake the costiveness worse after their action is over, but they also\r\nfrequently produce inflammation, and even abortion, by the violent\r\nstraining they cause. The best medicines, when they are really needed,\r\nare manna, seidlitz powders, or castor oil. Enemas are better however,\r\nas a general rule, such as those of thin starch, or molasses and water,\r\nto which may be added a little castor oil. The grand aim should be, in\r\nall such cases, to stimulate the bowels to an increased action without\r\nmedicines, by a properly regulated diet! Salads may be eaten when they\r\ndo not cause derangement of the stomach, and ripe or stewed fruits,\r\nparticularly figs, dates and prunes. Soups are also good, except they\r\ncontain rice, or vermicelli, or maccaroni. Bran bread should be eaten\r\nregularly, and not white. The only meats should be veal or poultry.\r\nAs a drink lemonade is excellent, with a little cream of tartar, or\r\ntamarind tea, or barley water sweetened with honey. With some patients\r\na cup of coffee, or a glass of beer will always relieve the bowels,\r\nespecially if a glass of water is also drank after it. I have known\r\npersons neglect the bowels so long that they have become completely\r\nimpacted, by the hard fæces, and could be relieved only by instruments.\r\nIt is very important to attend to this affection in time, and to\r\npersevere with the means of permanent relief regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY AND DIARRHŒA.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently the case that pregnant females, instead of being\r\nconstipated are afflicted with severe diarrhœa. This may arise from\r\ninflammation, and is then attended by fever, and extreme tenderness and\r\nsoreness of the bowels. Most usually however it is entirely nervous,\r\nand arises from the sympathetic irritation of the womb. There is then\r\nno tenderness or soreness, no fever, no derangements of the appetite,\r\nnor in fact any other symptom of any consequence. If it remains long\r\nunchecked blood will be discharged, from the extreme irritation of the\r\nintestines, and it is then called dysentery. This is nearly always\r\naccompanied by fever and general irritation. Sometimes there will be a\r\nconstant and painful desire felt to move the bowels, but with little\r\npower to do so, and at the same time a burning heat and unpleasant\r\nsensation at the fundus. This is called _tenesmus_, and the straining\r\nfrom it has frequently produced abortion.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhœa is not excessive, and the female does not lose her\r\nappetite, or strength, it is better let alone, particularly if she\r\nbe of a full habit, and disposed to fever. If thought desirable to\r\ncheck it a little, this may usually be done by a change in the diet.\r\nRice milk, sago, tapioca, and arrow-root may be taken, white bread\r\nmay be used, and not much fluid drunk. If such means are insufficient\r\nan injection may be thrown up the rectum in the morning, of thin\r\nstarch, with a tea-spoonful of laudanum. The abdomen may also be well\r\nfomented, and a dose of Tincture of Rhubarb taken occasionally. If\r\nthe tenesmus is very troublesome, an injection of tepid water may be\r\nused, and the female should sit occasionally over the steam of hot\r\nwater: in extremely painful cases a few leeches may be used round the\r\nfundament, and a hot flaxseed poultice placed over the abdomen. A warm\r\nbath is also an excellent remedy with many. When the diarrhœa still\r\ncontinues notwithstanding the above remedies, resort should be had to\r\ntonics and opiates. The patient should take Port wine and Peruvian\r\nbark, or some _Gentian wine_, and use injections of Starch and Laudanum\r\nregularly. Cammomile tea may also be freely drunk, and an opium pill\r\nmay be taken at night. Above all, the patient must endeavor to avoid\r\nall mental agitation. When dysentery sets in, every effort should be\r\nmade to subdue it as early as possible. Half a pint of rice milk, with\r\nten or fifteen drops of laudanum may be taken two or three times a\r\nday, and an injection may also be used night and morning of flaxseed,\r\nwith fifteen or twenty drops of laudanum. M. Colombat recommends the\r\nfollowing recipe as seldom failing to cure. Take the whites of six eggs\r\nand beat them up in a quart of water; then use one-third as a drink,\r\nand the rest as an injection. A neat spoonful should be drunk every\r\nten minutes, and an injection used every two hours, but not more than\r\none small syringeful at a time. A tea-spoonful of syrup of poppies,\r\nwith some loaf sugar, may also be added to every spoonful that is\r\ndrunk. Eggs, jellies, and rich soups, with meat and wine, if there be\r\nno inflammation, may be taken regularly, in addition to the articles\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPNŒA, OR DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING.\r\n\r\nThere are but few pregnant females who do not complain more or less of\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and this difficulty may arise from different\r\ncauses. In the earlier months it is caused by sympathetic irritation\r\nonly, the same as difficulty of swallowing. In the latter months it is\r\ncaused by the enlarged womb filling up the abdomen so much that the\r\nlungs in the chest are pressed upon and have not sufficient room to\r\nplay freely. It may also be caused by a plethoric or too full habit,\r\nthe lungs then being in reality congested.\r\n\r\nThe temporary difficulty of breathing which is felt in the early\r\nmonths, from nervous sympathy, needs scarcely any kind of treatment,\r\nas it passes off naturally in a short time. In severe attacks the same\r\nremedies may be used as for difficulty of swallowing before referred to.\r\n\r\nThat which arises in the latter months, from pressure of the womb,\r\ncan frequently be relieved only by the patient remaining as long as\r\npossible in certain favorable positions. I have known many who could\r\nnever sleep except when propped nearly upright, by means of pillows\r\nand cushions, as immediately they assumed the recumbent position the\r\nupward pressure became so great they were nearly suffocated. In such\r\ncases the patient should be careful never to eat or drink to excess,\r\nnor take anything likely to produce wind, because the least increase in\r\nthe size of the abdomen adds to the difficulty. The bowels should also\r\nbe kept free, and nothing tight or heavy in the way of clothing should\r\nbe worn.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty is most frequently seen in those who have contracted\r\nchests, and in those who have been accustomed to wear corsets and tight\r\ndresses. A deformed pelvis may also give rise to it by forcing the womb\r\nabove its usual position. Many females both create and increase this\r\ndifficulty by binding themselves tighter than usual during pregnancy,\r\nunder the mistaken idea that it enables them to support their burden so\r\nmuch easier.\r\n\r\nWhen the dyspnœa arises from a full habit the patient must live low,\r\nkeep the body regularly bathed and rubbed, and the bowels freely\r\nopen by an occasional seidlitz powder, or dose of Epsom Salts. If\r\nthe difficulty becomes at any time suddenly great and alarming, the\r\nfeet should be placed immediately in hot water, while the patient is\r\nupright; a mustard plaster should also be put upon the chest, and an\r\nopening injection of starch and Castor Oil administered as soon as\r\npossible. The usual practice in such cases is to bleed from the arm,\r\nto the extent of eight or ten ounces, and in case no other means give\r\nrelief, this may be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUGH.\r\n\r\nLike the previous affection cough is most usually produced during\r\npregnancy by sympathetic irritation. It may arise, however from a\r\npartial congestion, or inflammation of the lungs or bronchial tubes,\r\nproduced by a too great determination of blood to them. In the merely\r\nnervous cough, there is no expectoration, nor any soreness or pain in\r\nthe chest, and it will frequently disappear for several days together.\r\nNo particular attention need be bestowed upon this cough, unless\r\nit become so violent as to threaten abortion. In that case a pill,\r\ncontaining one grain of opium, may be taken, or from ten to fifteen\r\ndrops of laudanum, whenever the attack is severe. Barley water, or\r\ngum arabic water, may also be freely drunk, with a large spoonful of\r\nSyrup of Poppies added to each pint. A small dose of Hive Syrup, or\r\nParegoric, will also be found sometimes better than anything else. An\r\nenema of Starch and Laudanum, as formerly described, will also relieve,\r\nin some cases, better than anything taken by the mouth. The body should\r\nbe kept warm, particularly the feet, and a mustard poultice may be\r\nplaced over the chest, if the straining at any time becomes too great.\r\nSome patients experience relief from an assafœtida pill, or a little\r\nmusk, and others from a small dram of cordial, or wine.\r\n\r\nIf there be expectoration, with fever, and tenderness in the chest,\r\nor sharp pains when a long breath is drawn, there is reason to fear\r\ninflammation of the lungs, or bronchitis. In this case all the above\r\nmeans, except the wine and stimulants, may also be used only more\r\nfreely, and the mustard poultice must be kept on till it makes a\r\nblister. The patient must live low, her feet must be frequently bathed\r\nin hot water, and her bowels regularly opened either with saline\r\npurgatives or enemas. All that is requisite is to keep the inflammation\r\nfrom extending till after delivery, when it usually subsides without\r\nany further trouble. As soon as the womb is emptied, its pressure\r\nupon the abdominal aorta ceases, and the blood can then flow freely\r\nto the lower extremities, and thus the lungs become relieved and the\r\ninflammation goes down.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALPITATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis is also a frequent accompaniment of pregnancy, and one that is\r\nlikely to cause alarm sometimes, from its violence. Unless dependant\r\nupon organic disease of the heart however, it is in general only\r\na nervous affection, and passes away with delivery. We may always\r\nreasonably suppose it to be nervous when it occurs only during\r\npregnancy, and particularly if it is irregular in its frequency and\r\nviolence. I have known females who were always attacked with it about\r\nthe same period, and who could therefore always tell when it was coming\r\non, and sometimes even how long it would last. It will sometimes come\r\non during sleep, and so forcibly as to waken the patient instantly. At\r\nother times while awake, it will commence so suddenly that she will\r\nsink down as if struck by a powerful blow.\r\n\r\nThe only directions that can be given for alleviating it are, to keep\r\nas quiet as possible, use the bath regularly, avoid constipation,\r\nand live rather low, particularly if the patient be of a full habit.\r\nExercise should also be taken regularly in the open air, but not of a\r\nviolent kind. She should also sleep with the head on a high pillow,\r\nand never eat late suppers, nor take any food that disagrees with the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of stimulants, such as wine, coffee and spices, should be\r\nabstained from, and all powerful emotions carefully guarded against.\r\nDuring an attack a few drops of Laudanum, or an Opium pill may be\r\ntaken, and the feet placed in hot water. An Assafœtida pill is\r\nsometimes good, or a little Ether. Bleeding is generally practised in\r\nextreme cases, but there is often considerable danger in it.\r\n\r\nA too full habit is often the exciting cause of the palpitation, as may\r\nbe seen by the patient being always liable on the slightest exertion\r\nto flushed face, dimness of sight, ringing in the ears, swelling of\r\nthe limbs, and puffiness of the gums, sometimes to such an extent that\r\nthe mouth will taste of blood. Such persons should carefully observe\r\na moderate unstimulating and simple diet, and never allow the bowels\r\nto remain constipated more than a single day. They should also rub and\r\nwash the skin well, and study calmness and quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNCOPE, OR FAINTING.\r\n\r\nIn this condition, which is just the reverse of the former, the heart\r\nsuspends its action altogether; the breathing ceases, all power of\r\nmotion and feeling is lost, the face turns ghastly pale, the eyes\r\nclose, and the individual seems as if actually dead. It seldom lasts\r\nhowever more than five minutes, when the pulse gradually begins to\r\nbeat, the color returns, and the individual slowly recovers. Some\r\nfemales are liable to such attacks once a month, others once a week,\r\nothers every few days, and some at irregular periods. They are\r\ngenerally preceded by a dull pain at the pit of the stomach, fullness\r\nin the head, yawning, and loss of sight, or ringing in the ears.\r\n\r\nThe causes that predispose to this fainting are not very well\r\nunderstood, though there is no doubt but it is mainly dependant upon\r\nuterine disturbances. In some females it is brought on by the sudden\r\nmotions of the fœtus, or by their remaining too long in one posture.\r\nIn others it is produced by straining from constipation, or by sudden\r\nfright or anger. In very nervous persons it not unfrequently arises\r\nfrom unpleasant sights, smells, and sounds. In fact it is caused in\r\nthem much the same as a common hysterical fit, such as is described in\r\nmy _Diseases of Woman_. A full habit, and over feeding, or drinking\r\nstimulating liquors may also bring it on, and so on the contrary may a\r\nstate of weakness and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThis accident is more alarming than dangerous, except to the child,\r\nwhich may lose its life if the fainting lasts too long.\r\n\r\nTo recover a person from one of these fainting fits, she should be laid\r\nupon her back on a level place, and every part of her dress should\r\nbe carefully loosed. Some strong odor should then be applied to the\r\nnostrils, such as hartshorn, vinegar, burnt feathers, or smelling\r\nsalts. The body should be well rubbed over the heart and lungs, either\r\nwith the hand or with a soft, dry napkin. Cold water may also be\r\ndashed on the face, and the hands may be well chafed. If the fit still\r\nendures, a mustard plaster may be placed on each arm, or the whole body\r\nmay be placed in a warm bath, if convenient. Care should also be taken\r\nto admit the fresh air freely. As soon as she begins to show signs of\r\nconsciousness, a little wine or brandy may be placed in the mouth, and\r\nthe body may be elevated a little.\r\n\r\nTo guard against such attacks, the same precautions as to diet and mode\r\nof life must be observed as were directed in the article on palpitation\r\nof the heart; and, as this accident is most frequent in those of a\r\nhysterical habit, they should carefully follow the advice given in the\r\narticle _Hysteria_, in my _Diseases of Woman_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADACHE AND DIZZINESS IN THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nEach of these distressing affections, both of which are very common\r\nduring pregnancy, may arise either from nervous excitement or from a\r\nfull habit and determination of blood to the head. Nervous headache\r\nis generally met with in the earlier months of pregnancy, and is\r\ncharacterized by being frequently periodical, and often confined to\r\nparticular spots. It also commences suddenly, from some excitement\r\nor depression of mind, and leaves little or no distress when it is\r\ngone. The headache, which arises from a too full habit, commences with\r\nflushing of the face, heaviness in the eyes, dull pain in the forehead,\r\nand a sense of uneasiness, with disposition to sleep or dose. It seldom\r\ncomes on much till the latter months of gestation. Headache may arise\r\nalso accidentally, from derangement of the stomach, but this cause is\r\neasily ascertained by the furred tongue, loss of appetite, and bitter\r\ntaste in the mouth; it is also felt most acutely in the back of the\r\nhead, down by the neck, and passes away immediately the stomach is\r\ncorrected by an emetic, or by fasting.\r\n\r\nNervous headache during pregnancy often defies all our attempts to\r\nalleviate it, though we sometimes succeed in doing so. The best general\r\nremedies are warm baths, and, if the bowels are constipated, enemas of\r\nstarch and castor oil daily. To these may be added occasional small\r\ndoses of Laudanum, or an Opium pill, or two grains of Camphor. Smelling\r\nodors, such as Camphor, Cologne, or Hartshorn, will relieve some, but\r\nwill make others worse; so that its utility can only be determined by\r\nexperience. When a severe attack comes on, the patient should put her\r\nfeet in warm water, or use a warm bath, take a few drops of Laudanum,\r\nor a little Musk, or Valerian, and then try to go to sleep. To guard\r\nagainst the attack, she must never overload the stomach, nor take\r\nanything indigestible; and never think too much nor allow herself to\r\nbecome excited or depressed.\r\n\r\nWhen the trouble is caused by a too full habit, she must observe the\r\ndirections given in the articles on palpitation of the heart, and\r\nSyncope. The diet must be mild and not too nutritious, the bowels must\r\nbe regularly moved every day, chiefly by Epsom Salts and Seidlitz\r\nPowders, and regular gentle exercise must be taken in the open air.\r\n\r\nIn the latter months it is especially important to attend to a severe\r\nheadache _immediately_, particularly when the pain is seated _at the\r\ntop of the head_, because it is very likely, if unchecked, to terminate\r\nin convulsions. The means above recommended must be carefully and\r\nperseveringly applied; the feet must be kept warm, the bowels freely\r\nopened, and the head kept cool by wet clothes, or cold lotions, or ice.\r\nIt is the general practice in all such cases, if the pain does not\r\nabate soon, and the pulse be full and quick, to bleed freely at the\r\narm, and the most eminent physicians of the Allopathic school assure\r\nus, that the life of the patient frequently depends upon its being done\r\npromptly. I have no doubt, however, but that relief can be generally\r\nobtained by the simple means described, if they are used early and\r\nperseveringly.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSOMNIA, OR SLEEPLESSNESS.\r\n\r\nThere are few affections that cause more real distress during pregnancy\r\nthan this. Many females will be utterly unable to sleep for many days\r\nand nights together, and others can only obtain a few minutes broken\r\nand unrefreshing sleep at distant intervals. There is danger, when this\r\nstate becomes highly aggravated, that it may lead to delirium, or that\r\nthe want of rest may wear away the strength to such a degree, that\r\nthe patient will sink from mere exhaustion. There are some females,\r\nhowever, who will remain without sleep, or at most take but very\r\nlittle, for a long time, without suffering any inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThis affection is essentially a nervous one, and the only means likely\r\nto relieve it are those that have a tendency to soothe and calm the\r\nnerves. If the patient be surrounded by any irritating circumstances\r\nthey should be at once removed, or she herself removed from them.\r\nParticular attention must be paid to the diet, so that no derangement\r\nof the stomach or bowels be kept up, and a regular system of out-door\r\nexercise must be practised. A warm bath just before going to bed, with\r\na good rubbing of the skin, will frequently act like magic in procuring\r\nrest. As a general rule narcotic drugs should not be used, but in\r\nextreme cases they may be resorted to sparingly. A single Opium pill,\r\nor a few drops of Laudanum may be taken after the bath. If the patient\r\nbe thin and delicate, she should eat meat, eggs, and milk, and take a\r\nlittle wine, if it causes no unpleasant symptoms. Indeed a glass of\r\nwine will frequently act better than Laudanum, and so will ale with\r\nsome, and coffee with others. If the patient be of a full habit these\r\nthings will be improper, and may injure. She should then be kept quiet,\r\nand fed sparingly. _Music_ has a powerful effect in many of these\r\ncases:--a slow, solemn air, played while the patient is reclining after\r\nher bath, seldom fails in inducing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPORARY AFFECTION OF THE SIGHT, HEARING, AND SMELL.\r\n\r\nThese disorders are quite common during pregnancy, particularly in the\r\nlatter months. Some females will be utterly unable to distinguish any\r\nodors, even the most powerful; others completely lose their taste, and\r\nothers again become deaf or blind. When they are caused only by the\r\nsympathetic action of the womb, such deprivations are seldom of long\r\nduration, though they may recur at frequent intervals. In some cases\r\nthey remain a considerable time, and great fear is felt that they may\r\nbecome permanent, but there is little danger of such a result. I knew\r\na lady who suddenly lost her sight when about two months gone, and who\r\nremained totally blind till about three hours after her delivery, when\r\nher sight returned in a moment as perfect as before. The same thing\r\nhas frequently been observed of the other senses. In some cases the\r\nvision will not be lost but perverted, and the patient will then see\r\neverything double, or larger or smaller than natural, or always of a\r\nwrong color. In like manner some will hear imaginary conversations, or\r\nwill fancy everybody is shouting, or perhaps only whispering, though\r\nthey are all the time speaking in their natural voice.\r\n\r\nThese perversions, when thus produced, need occasion no alarm, and\r\nseldom require attention, unless accompanied by other urgent symptoms.\r\nThey may arise however, from a fullness of blood in the head, in which\r\ncase they are accompanied by a flushed face and drowsiness, and are\r\npreceded by bright sparks flashing before the eyes, or by ringing in\r\nthe ears.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of all these affections should be the same as that\r\nrecommended for most of the previous derangements, particularly for\r\n_Headache_, _Syncope_, and _Palpitation of the Heart_. If there be\r\nnervous excitement merely, it must be calmed in the same way as\r\nrecommended in the articles referred to, and also in the last one on\r\nsleeplessness. If the female be of a full habit, and there is evidently\r\na pressure of blood on the brain and nerves of the special senses, the\r\nsame means should be adopted to reduce the system, and draw the blood\r\nto the extremities, that have already been described.\r\n\r\nIn such cases these sudden deprivations of sight and hearing sometimes\r\nindicate the commencement of Convulsions, or Apoplexy, particularly\r\nif they occur during labor, when every means should be resorted to\r\n_instantly_ to relieve the pressure on the brain. If no simpler means\r\nsucceed in a reasonable time, it is the general custom to bleed freely\r\nfrom the arm, and there is no question but this frequently removes the\r\ndifficulty at once, whatever objections may be made to the practice.\r\nIt is also proper to say that many eminent practitioners, who are not\r\nadvocates of the lancet in general, strenuously urge that it should be\r\nused immediately if the sight or hearing suddenly disappear in this\r\nway at any time. And I certainly have myself known these accidents\r\nsometimes followed by a fit of Apoplexy, or Convulsions, and even\r\ndeath. Such was the case with a friend of one of my patients. She\r\nfound one day, quite suddenly, that she could only see _half_ of any\r\nthing she looked at, and at times it even disappeared altogether.\r\nNothing was done for her, and in about five hours after the first\r\nattack she fell speechless and died before they could lift her upon\r\nthe bed. It will therefore be a necessary precaution, in all pregnant\r\nfemales of a full habit, to attend rigidly to the advice that has been\r\ngiven, because _simple_ means, used in time, and regularly, may prevent\r\nthe necessity of stronger ones altogether. In purely nervous cases of\r\nthis kind no apprehension whatever need be felt, and no such practice\r\nas bleeding is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERED JUDGMENT, INCLINATIONS, AND PROPENSITIES.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic irritation of the uterus, in some females produces\r\nextraordinary phenomena of this kind, from simple desire to the most\r\nfurious craving, and from mere caprice to actual insanity. There is no\r\ndoubt but that many of these unusual desires, or _longings_ as they\r\nare called, are either produced or much aggravated by the imagination\r\nof the patient, and frequently would never be experienced at all,\r\nif the idea was not suggested by other people having had the same.\r\nCustom and imitation are very powerful in such cases, particularly\r\nwhen the nervous sensibility is much exalted. Still the most singular\r\naberrations of this kind will often arise without any such adventitious\r\naid, and the fact should be borne in mind, so that these temporary\r\nvagaries may be regarded with proper charity and forbearance.\r\n\r\nSome females will entirely change in their dispositions at these\r\ntimes, the most amiable and mild becoming positively ill-natured and\r\nmalicious;--the gentle will turn headstrong, the haughty and proud will\r\nbecome humble, and the gay will become melancholy, or the sad will\r\nmadly seek every kind of gaiety. Such things however should never be\r\nremembered, nor be brought up against them afterwards, for truly at\r\nsuch times _they know not what they do_!\r\n\r\nWomen have been known while in this state, to become thievish, or to\r\nhave an irresistible propensity to burn or kill. Some have even been\r\nknown to exhibit great talents for music or poetry, though ordinarily\r\nwithout any capacity for such things. Some will suddenly exhibit a\r\nmost extraordinary intellect, while others will become quite silly. A\r\nmedical writer tells us an instance of one female who always had an\r\nexcellent sound judgment while pregnant, but _no memory_, while in\r\nher ordinary state she had a poor judgment but _a most extraordinary\r\ngood memory_. The celebrated Baudelocque gives an account of another\r\nwho could scarcely eat anything but what she _stole_, while going to\r\nmarket; and another writer mentions a lady who longed till she was\r\nalmost delirious to bite a piece out of a baker's shoulder, who worked\r\nopposite her window. There is even an account of one who longed to eat\r\nsome of her husband, whom she dearly loved, and who actually killed\r\nhim to satisfy her appetite, and then salted pieces of the body to\r\nkeep for future use. A writer named Vives also tells us of a female\r\nwhose husband paid a large sum of money for her to be allowed to bite\r\na young man's neck, it being evident that she would be nearly certain\r\nto miscarry unless so gratified. In the year 1816, at Mons, in France,\r\nan unfortunate woman in this condition was seized with an irresistible\r\nimpulse to destroy her children, and actually drowned three of them,\r\nand herself afterwards. She had previously sent a poisoned cake also to\r\none at school, but fortunately it was not eaten.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking all these things pass away with delivery, if not\r\nbefore, unless it be actual insanity, which sometimes remains. All\r\nthat can be done is to attend strictly to the general health, keep the\r\nskin, bowels, and stomach, in good action, and remove all depressing\r\nor irritating circumstances. If there be a propensity to anything\r\ndecidedly injurious or dangerous, the patient must be strictly watched,\r\nbut without its being perceived or known by her, for fear of exciting\r\nsuspicion in those who would be disposed to be cunningly secret or\r\nrevengeful. Proper diet, regular bathing, and out-door exercise often\r\ncorrect many of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\nHÆMOPTYSIS, HÆMATEMESIS AND EPISTAXIS.\r\n\r\nThese three terms mean _spitting of blood_, _vomiting of blood_,\r\nand _bleeding from the nose_, all of which frequently occur during\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nSpitting of blood is most usually observed in nervous women, and in\r\nthose of a full habit. It is caused partly by sympathetic irritation,\r\nand partly by the womb pressing upwards against the diaphragm and\r\nlessening the size of the chest, which deranges the circulation in\r\nthe lungs, and causes rupture of their blood vessels. The premonitory\r\nsymptoms are pains round the waist, cold extremities, creeping of\r\nthe skin, and a sensation of anxiety or depression round the heart.\r\nThe attack begins by difficulty of breathing, heat in the chest, and\r\ndry cough, followed by spitting up more or less bloody frothy mucus;\r\nall which symptoms are much increased by violent exercise, or a hot\r\natmosphere. In ordinary cases a mere spitting of blood need occasion no\r\ngreat alarm, unless attended by symptoms of inflammation, or unless the\r\npatient has had cough, and other indications of pulmonary derangement\r\nbefore conception.\r\n\r\nIn hæmatemesis the blood is vomited from the stomach, and is in black\r\nclots, frequently mixed with the food, or bile, while that which comes\r\nfrom the lungs in spitting on the contrary is bright red, and quite\r\nfresh. In vomiting of blood also, there is seldom any cough or exertion\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of spitting of blood must be nearly the same as for many\r\nother derangements already described. When there is a full habit, the\r\npatient must live low, keep the bowels free, and the skin in good\r\norder, and avoid all agitation of mind or over exertion of body. An\r\nOpium pill occasionally will be useful, or a few drops of laudanum. The\r\ncough must be combatted in the way recommended in my previous article\r\non _Cough_. Lemonade or tamarind tea, with some Syrup of Poppies\r\nadded, may be freely drunk, or some of the black currant root tea. The\r\ntreatment of Hæmatemesis is precisely the same. Occasionally however\r\nthe blood will pass into the intestines and occasion colic, and then it\r\nmust be removed by administering an enema of starch and castor oil, or\r\na little manna may be taken.\r\n\r\nEpistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is much more frequent than either\r\nof the preceding, but is seldom of much consequence. In many cases in\r\nfact it is highly beneficial, as it relieves the head from pressure,\r\nand thus obviates many inconveniences. If it continue too long, or\r\nbecomes excessive, it may generally be arrested by putting cold wet\r\ncloths between the eyes, and on the cheeks, while the head is kept\r\nelevated. The feet and hands should be kept warm, and the air breathed\r\nshould be as cold as possible. In extreme cases, the nostrils may be\r\nplugged with bits of sponge, or cotton, or some powdered alum may be\r\nsnuffed up them. The best plan is to raise the hands above the head and\r\nput something very cold, as a lump of ice for instance, or a piece of\r\ncold iron, between the shoulders; this seldom fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOSE VEINS.\r\n\r\nVery often in pregnant women the veins in different parts, but\r\nparticularly of the thighs and legs will swell out in knots, either\r\nsingly or in bunches, sometimes like strings of beads, or like the\r\nlinks of a chain. These are called _Varices_, and occasionally they\r\nattain a large size, and extend to various other portions of the body,\r\nas the external lips, vagina, and mouth of the womb. Some women in fact\r\nhave them over nearly the whole body. They are caused by the pressure\r\nof the womb on the large abdominal veins, preventing the return of the\r\nblood and disturbing the balance of circulation between the veins and\r\narteries. In the majority of cases, unless very large, they cause but\r\nlittle inconvenience, and may be let alone, but sometimes they cause\r\npain, or become so full that there is danger of their bursting, and\r\nthen it is necessary to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done is to relieve the abdominal veins from the\r\npressure of the womb, and this may be done by the patient keeping more\r\nor less the horizontal position, and carefully avoiding all violent\r\nexertion. The swelling is always worse during the latter part of the\r\nday, particularly if the woman has been much on her feet, she should\r\ntherefore apply a cloth roller round the limbs before she rises in\r\nthe morning. If this be carefully put on, just tight enough not to\r\ninterfere with the motion of the limbs, nor totally obstruct the\r\ncirculation, it will prevent the varices to a great extent, if not\r\naltogether. Brisk friction with the hand will disperse the swelling\r\nin many persons, or warm fomentations, but sometimes _cold_ bathing\r\nanswers better. It is advisable always to disperse them as soon as\r\npossible, for if they remain too long that part of the vein becomes\r\npermanently weakened by being overstretched, and will be always liable\r\nto swell again from any slight cause. It is particularly advisable in\r\nthese cases to avoid constipation, and also to keep the skin in good\r\naction by bathing and frictions.\r\n\r\nIf at any time one of these varices should burst, it need occasion no\r\nalarm, unless it be seated on a large vein, and the bleeding becomes\r\nprofuse. To stop it, bind on firmly over the rent any firm _cold_ body,\r\nas a flat stone, or a large silver coin, passing the bandage several\r\ntimes round. In slight cases a simple cold compress will be sufficient,\r\nor a little powdered alum, or some vinegar and water. In short any of\r\nthe usual remedies for stopping bleeding from wounds. The female must\r\nbe quite still till it is stopped, and must be careful when she begins\r\nto move about again, because it is liable to break out afresh. Those of\r\na very full habit must live low, and avoid all stimulants, so as not to\r\nincrease the quantity of blood in the body more than is necessary. It\r\nis advisable to remove the varices, as much as possible, before labor\r\ncomes on, particularly if they are situated on the lips, or in the\r\nvagina, because they may burst during delivery and cause considerable\r\ninconvenience, or even danger. It is rare that these swellings continue\r\nafter delivery, but if they should do so, the same treatment must be\r\npersisted in as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nHÆMORRHOIDS, OR PILES.\r\n\r\nThese are troublesome annoyances at any time, but particularly during\r\npregnancy, and unfortunately they are very common at that time. They\r\nare, no doubt, chiefly caused in the same way as varicose veins, that\r\nis by the enlarged womb preventing the proper flow of the blood in\r\nthe small veins, and so causing them to swell, and form tumors. They\r\nmay in fact be called varices, as truly so as those on the limbs.\r\nIn many persons however they are undoubtedly brought on merely by\r\n_Constipation_, which will undoubtedly either cause them or make them\r\nmuch worse when otherwise produced. In general they become worse as the\r\npregnancy advances, because the womb becomes larger and the bowels are\r\nmore apt to be confined.\r\n\r\nAs long as they only cause inconvenience, without any particular\r\ndistress or urgent symptom, they may be let alone, or be slightly\r\ntreated in the way of palliation, till after delivery, when they\r\nwill disappear. Occasionally however, they grow to a large size, so\r\nas to hinder the passage of the bowels, and prevent the patient from\r\nsitting down or walking. They may then cause inflammation, and bring\r\non falling of the intestine, or abortion, by the straining which they\r\nnecessitate when the bowels are moved. And even if these extreme\r\nresults do not follow, there may be serious derangements of the general\r\nhealth, indicated by difficulty of breathing, sleeplessness, headache,\r\nand fever. In short there are few of the derangements incident to\r\npregnancy so annoying as this, and unfortunately, from its nature, the\r\nsufferer dislikes to speak of it and seek the necessary assistance.\r\nMany prefer undergoing the most excruciating agony for months, rather\r\nthan complain, which shows the necessity for females knowing how to\r\ntreat themselves, when possible.\r\n\r\nThe bleeding which sometimes takes place from Piles is more often\r\nbeneficial than otherwise, unless it becomes excessive, from rupture\r\nof a large vessel, in which case, if the wound is external, it may be\r\ntreated the same as the ruptured varicose vein; if it be internal, the\r\nremedies must be injected with a syringe, or a large roll of lint or\r\ncotton may be soaked in alum water and passed up the rectum. Frequently\r\nbathing the thighs and perineum with cold water will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the pain and swelling, the female should sit over the\r\nsteam of hot water, and use the warm bath. If the piles are external,\r\nthey should be bathed with hot milk and Laudanum, or rubbed with any\r\nsoothing ointment, particularly the _Cucumber Ointment_, mentioned\r\nin my Diseases of Woman, or with _Stramonium Ointment_. If they are\r\ninternal the milk and Laudanum should be injected if possible, or some\r\nthin starch and Laudanum, and a stiff roll of cloth may be smeared with\r\nthe ointment and introduced. In general, ointments or other greasy\r\nmatters are not so good as the milk or starch. In conjunction with\r\nthis, the bowels must be kept free, either with enemas or castor oil,\r\nor by using a seidlitz powder in the morning. This is indispensable,\r\nfor if constipation exists, no applications can render much service.\r\nThe patient must also avoid fatigue, and not remain too long upon her\r\nfeet, nor sit long, particularly on a hard seat, and if she be of a\r\nfull habit she must live low, to avoid making too much blood. It is\r\nalso important, at all times, to avoid using drastic purgatives, such\r\nas Aloes, Colocynth, or Gamboge, as they always make piles much worse,\r\nor even cause them.\r\n\r\n\r\nŒDEMA, OR WATERY SWELLINGS.\r\n\r\nThis affection also appears, like the preceding, to arise from\r\nobstructed circulation, but instead of the blood accumulating it is\r\nmerely the serum, or watery portion of it. The swellings are generally\r\nwhitish, and spread about, and a small pit remains in them when pressed\r\nwith the finger. They are found on various parts of the lower limbs,\r\nand on the groin or abdomen, and also upon the external lips, in which\r\nplace they are often exceedingly troublesome. As a general rule these\r\nswellings are of small account, and as they disappear with delivery,\r\nbut little attention need be bestowed upon them. Sometimes, however,\r\nthey become very extensive, and so engorged that they inflame and are\r\nextremely painful. They have even been known to mortify, and cause\r\nconsiderable sloughing, particularly when chafed and afterwards wet\r\nwith the urine. In these extreme cases there may be serious disturbance\r\nof the general health, from the constant irritation, and from the\r\npatient being unable to walk about. I have often known the limbs and\r\nvulva covered with patches of Erysipelas from this cause. Sometimes the\r\nswellings even become so large that they interfere with the process of\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this affection consists in rest, particularly lying\r\ndown, saline purgatives, regular, and frequent washing the parts with\r\ncold milk and Laudanum, or with a solution of Borax, half an ounce to\r\na pint of water, to be used cold and with a tea-spoonful of Laudanum\r\nadded to it. Simple cold water is frequently quite sufficient. In\r\ngeneral all kinds of ointments are injurious, but if other means fail\r\nto give relief, the _Cucumber Ointment_ may be tried. The wash should\r\nalways be used after urinating, and the parts must not be rubbed, but\r\nlightly dried with a piece of soft linen. Fullers earth is often an\r\nexcellent application when there is chafing.\r\n\r\nIf the patient be of a full habit, she must carefully diet herself,\r\nand bathe regularly. If she be thin and weak, a generous diet will be\r\nadvisable, with meat and even a little wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRORRHEA, OR PROFUSE DISCHARGE OF WATER.\r\n\r\nThis consists in a discharge of water, more or less profuse, from\r\nthe vagina, at various periods during pregnancy. Some females will\r\nonly discharge a small quantity, at intervals, others will have a\r\nconstant dropping, and others again will pour out an immense quantity,\r\nsometimes several pints, or even quarts, in the course of a few days.\r\nIn general this water is quite limpid and colorless, but sometimes it\r\ncontains much mucus, and at other times it is tinged with blood. It\r\ndoes not appear that this discharge leads to any evil result, even when\r\nexcessive, and I only refer to it to relieve anxiety. The origin of\r\nthis water is not yet ascertained, but it is generally thought to be\r\nsecreted between the membranes and the womb, and to be quite distinct\r\nfrom the liquor amnii.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUSTULES, AND MUCOUS DISCHARGES.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the external lips will be covered with pustules during\r\npregnancy, and frequent discharges of mucus will occur from the vagina.\r\nThey are both however caused by the unusual action of the uterine\r\nsystem, and merely require frequent bathing of the parts with milk and\r\nLaudanum, and regular action of the bowels. The most important thing to\r\nremark in connection with them is that they have often been mistaken,\r\neven by medical men, for the effects of syphilitic disease, and much\r\ndistress has resulted from such mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERANGEMENTS OF THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nSeveral derangements of the urinary organs are liable to occur during\r\npregnancy, partly from sympathetic irritation, and partly from mere\r\npressure. Some of these may be partially relieved, others have to be\r\nborne as patiently as they can be till delivery removes them.\r\n\r\nThe swollen womb often presses on the neck of the bladder, and hinders\r\nthe passage of the urine, or even obstructs it sometimes altogether,\r\nand thus causes straining, burning heat, and great distension of the\r\nbladder. In some instances this passes off as the pregnancy advances,\r\nowing to the womb rising higher in the abdomen, but in other cases\r\nit remains more or less, during the whole term. It is particularly\r\nimportant, in such cases, that the female should not let the difficulty\r\nremain too long unremedied, for if the bladder be very full it may\r\nbecome utterly impossible to empty it by natural effort. Sometimes the\r\ndifficulty is much lessened by lying on the back a short time before\r\nattempting to urinate, or by raising up the abdomen with the hand at\r\nthe time. Many females can urinate with tolerable comfort while lying\r\non the back or abdomen, and others are much relieved by constantly\r\nwearing a bandage. Constipation always makes this difficulty worse,\r\nand sometimes even causes it, by keeping the rectum full and thus\r\nincreasing the pressure. In all such cases it will be readily seen,\r\nthat forcing medicines are not only useless, but liable to cause\r\ninjury. The change of position, rest, and supporting the abdomen are\r\nthe means to be relied upon. If these fail, and the urine accumulates,\r\nthe catheter must be used. A warm bath, or fomentation with warm water\r\nand Laudanum, will assist, and sometimes relieve alone. To ease the\r\nburning and distress the patient must drink freely of gum water, or\r\nbarley tea, with a little Syrup of Poppies.\r\n\r\nThere is one manœuvre which, if practised aright, will nearly always\r\nallow the female to urinate with ease, and fortunately she can practise\r\nit herself. It consists in introducing two of the fingers into the\r\nvagina, and raising up the womb, as if practising the _ballotment_.\r\nThis removes the pressure from the bladder, and the urine then escapes\r\nby natural effort. A few trials will soon enable any one to do this,\r\nparticularly if they notice well the form and position of the parts, as\r\nshown in the plates of this work. A lady who heard me mention this in\r\none of my Lectures, afterwards stated that the knowledge of it enabled\r\nher to dispense altogether with the catheter, which she was previously\r\nnecessitated to use during most of her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhen there is merely a nervous irritation causing the difficulty,\r\nthe warm bath, or fomentation with warm water and Laudanum will be\r\nsufficient, or a little Belladonna Ointment may be rubbed over the\r\nmeatus urinarius, while some starch and Laudanum is injected carefully\r\ninto the vagina.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAMPS.\r\n\r\nThese arise from the womb pressing on the nerves of the sacrum, and\r\nare therefore not under the control of medicine. All that can be done\r\nis to change the position of the body as much as possible, from lying\r\ndown to standing up, and by turning from one side to another. Brisk\r\nrubbing with the hand will also assist in giving relief. The cramps\r\nhowever usually disappear after delivery, and must therefore be borne\r\nas patiently as possible till that takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRURITUS, OR ITCHING OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS.\r\n\r\nHaving treated this affection fully in my _Diseases of Woman_, I cannot\r\ndo better than extract the article from that work on the subject.\r\n\r\n \"This disease, though not so immediately dangerous as some others, is\r\n perhaps the most distressing that can be met with.\r\n\r\n \"It consists in an intolerable and incessant itching of the parts,\r\n which nothing seems to allay. Sometimes it is so bad that the female\r\n is almost tormented to death; she cannot see company, or walk out, and\r\n often shuts herself up alone in her agony. Many have fainted from it,\r\n and some have even become delirious. I have seen patients whose hands\r\n it was necessary to tie, to prevent them tearing themselves to pieces.\r\n\r\n \"The causes of pruritus appear to be most of those that produce simple\r\n inflammation, which it very frequently accompanies or precedes.\r\n Pregnant females are very liable to it, and in some it will continue,\r\n in spite of all that can be done, till after delivery, when it\r\n usually disappears. I have known it produce abortion. Some females\r\n always have it at the menstrual period, and others during nursing.\r\n Occasionally there is a little eruption attending it, but not\r\n always, though the parts are generally swollen and red. Parasites\r\n are sometimes the exciting cause, and should always be destroyed\r\n immediately.\r\n\r\n \"The treatment consists in first attending strictly to the diet, which\r\n must be light and unirritating, and to the regular action of the\r\n bowels and womb; and in using the cooling washes and lotions before\r\n mentioned. If the itching still continues, use either of the following\r\n washes to the parts:--Sub. carbonate of potash three drachms, water\r\n four ounces; put a tea-spoonful of this into a quart of warm water,\r\n and use it three times a day.--A tea-spoonful of Eau de Cologne to a\r\n pint of warm water.--Sulphate of Zinc, half a tea-spoonful to a quart\r\n of warm water. Both these may be used many times in the day.--Borax\r\n half an ounce, Sulphate of Morphia six grains; pure water half a pint.\r\n This last seldom fails of giving relief. It should be applied three or\r\n four times a day, with a piece of soft linen, the parts being first\r\n washed with warm soap and water. A tea-spoonful of laudanum will\r\n sometimes answer as well as the six grains of Sulphate of Morphia.\r\n\r\n \"Caustic has been employed, and blisters to the inside of the thighs,\r\n but such violent remedies are seldom either necessary or serviceable.\r\n I have known the parts to be deeply scarified with the lancet, and\r\n even burnt with a _red hot iron_, without at all alleviating the\r\n pruritus.\r\n\r\n \"In young persons it seems to be often produced by constipation,\r\n worms, and gravel; but it most probably depends, essentially, on some\r\n impurity, or irritating quality, in the blood, or in the natural\r\n secretions of the parts, which should therefore never be allowed to\r\n remain long unwashed.\r\n\r\n \"Sitting in cold water, and the application of ice to the parts, has\r\n given relief. I have also effected many cures, almost instantaneously,\r\n by means of a small _Galvanic plate_, so constructed as to be worn\r\n just within the vulva.\r\n\r\n \"All remedies must of course be applied with caution during pregnancy;\r\n and it must be recollected that sometimes the disease _will_ continue,\r\n more or less, till after delivery, though the distress from it may be\r\n much alleviated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nIDIOPATHIC, OR PRIMARY DISEASES INCIDENT TO PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOODING, OR HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nFlooding is one of the most dangerous accidents that occur during\r\npregnancy, its consequences being often of the most serious character.\r\nThe causes that lead to flooding are very numerous, some of them\r\npredisposing to it, and others immediately exciting it. Among these\r\nmay be mentioned a too full habit, violent exertion, falls, coughing,\r\nvomiting, straining from costiveness or violent purgatives, forcing\r\nmedicines, criminal attempts at abortion, overwalking, blows on\r\nthe abdomen, too much dancing, or running up stairs, strong mental\r\nemotions, fright, or anger, and _certain excesses_. The immediate\r\ncause is the separation of the membrane in which the fœtus is inclosed\r\nfrom the walls of the womb. Flooding may however result from the\r\nplacenta growing over the mouth of the womb, and being torn as that\r\nopens--usually about the sixth or seventh month.--(See the article\r\n_Flooding_ during Labor.)\r\n\r\nIn most cases flooding is preceded by dull pain in the loins and\r\ngroins, and a sensation of weight and dragging. Similar sensations\r\nhowever are often produced by other causes, which makes it difficult to\r\npredicate, with any degree of certainty, whether the patient is about\r\nto flood or not. The very first appearance of blood from the vagina\r\nmust therefore be watched for carefully, as that removes all doubt,\r\nand warns us to be prompt with the proper remedies. Sometimes a female\r\nwill flood internally, the blood being retained by the passage being\r\nclosed or plugged up by clots, or by its passing behind the membranes,\r\nor under the centre of the placenta. These internal or concealed\r\nhemorrhages are very dangerous, as the patient may lose much blood\r\nbefore her condition is suspected. It is therefore necessary to bear\r\nthis in mind, and carefully use every means to ascertain whether such\r\nan accident has occurred or not. In general the indications are pretty\r\nplain, the patient suffering from deep seated and distressing pains in\r\nthe back and groins, with great weakness in the limbs, faintness, weak\r\npulse, dimness of sight, ringing in the ears, coldness of the hands and\r\nfeet, swelling of the abdomen, and finally fainting, particularly if\r\nthe retained blood suddenly escapes, which it usually does.\r\n\r\nIn the early months there is more danger to the child from flooding\r\nthan there is to the mother, because it is nearly certain to lead to\r\nabortion. In the latter months, on the contrary, the mother runs the\r\ngreatest risk, as the child may then live if it be expelled, while the\r\nmother may sink and die from excessive loss of blood. There are many\r\nfemales of a very full habit, who suffer but little from hemorrhage,\r\nunless it be excessive, indeed some seem to be benefitted by it, and\r\nare thus relieved from headache and convulsions. It should, however, be\r\ncarefully watched, and its effects duly noted.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of flooding must depend materially upon its severity, and\r\nthe time when it occurs. In the early months, when the discharge is\r\nslight, and when it causes little distress, simple means will answer.\r\nThe patient must lie on her back, on a hard mattress, with the pelvis\r\nraised, by means of a pillow, higher than the rest of the body. The air\r\nmust be kept fresh and cool around her; she must keep herself quiet in\r\nbody and mind, live rather low, and drink freely of cooling drinks,\r\nsuch as soda water, lemonade, tamarind tea, or ice water. [The fullest\r\ndirections for making and using all these drinks will be found in my\r\n\"Diseases of Woman.\"]\r\n\r\nIf the flooding does not stop with these simple means, external\r\napplications must be made, of cold, wet cloths, or even ice, over the\r\nabdomen, and inside the thighs. Finally, if further treatment is still\r\nneeded, cold astringent injections may be carefully thrown into the\r\nvagina. Cold water is perhaps as good as anything for this purpose,\r\nand I have frequently known a most severe flooding checked immediately\r\nby injecting cold water into the vagina and rectum, and applying cold\r\nwet cloths over the abdomen, and inside the thighs. Some astringent\r\ndrink may also assist, such as a little syrup of comfrey, or extract of\r\nRhatany, and particularly a tea made of the root of the black currant,\r\nas recommended in my \"Diseases of Woman.\"--[A handful of the root may\r\nbe boiled in two quarts of water, for twenty minutes; it should be\r\nsweetened to taste and drunk freely. The common blackberry, or the dew\r\nberry, is also excellent, though not so good as the black currant.]--If\r\nthe patient be nervous and irritable, or suffer much from pain, an\r\nopium pill may be taken, or from ten to twenty drops of laudanum.\r\n\r\nThe general practice in these cases is to _bleed_ freely and _give\r\nopium_! And as this practice certainly does succeed in many extreme\r\ncases, I should certainly recommend, if the simpler means fail, to\r\nresort to it at once. I dislike bleeding very much, in any cases, and\r\nhere it seems particularly inappropriate; I should therefore say _try\r\nalmost anything and everything first_, but never obstinately refuse to\r\ndo it if nothing else succeeds.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a plug or tampon is used, to fill up the vagina. It\r\nmay be made of a roll of cloth, cotton, or a piece of sponge. This\r\npractice, however, is useless in the latter months of pregnancy, and\r\nvery often fails even at other times. When it succeeds it causes the\r\nblood to coagulate, and thus closes up the mouths of the vessels. Quite\r\nas often, however, it only keeps it in, and makes it accumulate in the\r\nwomb till it all rushes away at once; still it may be tried.\r\n\r\nIf the hemorrhages should occur so frequently, or be so excessive, in\r\nspite of all treatment, as to endanger the safety of the patient, there\r\nis no other resource left to save her life but to produce abortion,\r\nbecause the presence of the fœtus and its appendages is evidently then\r\nthe irritating cause which keeps up the discharge, and it cannot be\r\nexpected to stop till the womb is emptied.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION, OR MISCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nWhen the fœtus is prematurely expelled before it can survive, it is\r\ncalled an _Abortion_, but if its expulsion take place so late that\r\nit can live, it is called _Miscarriage_. Both these are serious\r\naccidents. In abortion the child is lost, as a matter of course, but\r\nin miscarriage it may live, after the seventh month. The danger to\r\nthe mother is considerable from both, though greatest probably from\r\nabortion. It is probable that many very early miscarriages take place\r\nunperceived, the female suffering but little from the accident, and the\r\nembryo being too small to be seen, unless carefully looked for.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent periods for such accidents are found to be six\r\nmonths, five months, and three months; and what is very singular, a\r\nmuch greater number of male children are aborted than females, the\r\nproportion being about sixteen to eleven.\r\n\r\nThese accidents are so intimately connected with flooding, that many\r\nwriters always treat of them together, considering the flooding merely\r\nas the most frequent cause and symptom of miscarriage or abortion. In\r\nspeaking therefore of the immediate causes of premature expulsion of\r\nthe fœtus, we place hemorrhage first, and the causes before enumerated\r\nwhich produce that as being its most frequent remote ones.\r\n\r\nA full habit, with tendency to local congestion, seems to predispose\r\na female very much to miscarriage; every one so constituted should\r\ncarefully avoid luxurious living and an inactive life. Violent bodily\r\nexertion, falls, or blows, or strong mental excitement are most usually\r\nthe immediate causes, though with some it will come on spontaneously\r\nwithout any such exciting agencies. Some females will miscarry many\r\ntimes in succession, and always so near the same period, that they can\r\ntell to a day or two when it will happen. It seems to become a habit of\r\nthe womb with them to contract at that particular time, and the only\r\nway to break through the _habit_ is for them to avoid becoming pregnant\r\nfor some considerable time, say two or three years after, they may then\r\ngo the full time, but will seldom do so if they conceive immediately\r\nafter having miscarried. In some persons miscarriage is caused by a\r\n_too eager_ gratification of certain desires; but in others it may\r\narise _from the opposite cause_.\r\n\r\nThere is a disease of the womb also by no means unfrequent, though but\r\nlittle understood, which undoubtedly causes much miscarriage, and that\r\nis _Rheumatism of the Womb_! This mostly exists before the pregnancy\r\nhowever, and should be then treated according to the plan laid down in\r\nmy \"Diseases of Woman.\"\r\n\r\nMiscarriage also arises in many females from a rigid state of the\r\nmuscular fibres of the womb, which not relaxing sufficiently to allow\r\nthat organ to expand become irritated by the pressure they experience,\r\nand begin to contract. This contraction of the womb of course soon\r\nleads to the expulsion of its contents, the same as in real labor.\r\nWomen with their first children are more liable to miscarriage than\r\nothers on this account, the womb not having become habituated as it\r\nwere to the necessary relaxation.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the reason also why some females, after suffering from this\r\naccident many times in succession at last escape it. In general they\r\nmiscarry early the first time, from the womb not relaxing sufficiently,\r\nbut go a little longer the next time, and longer still the next, and\r\nso on till they reach the full period. The fibres of the womb have\r\ngradually become accustomed to relax, and have borne the irritation\r\nlonger and longer each pregnancy, till at last they have forborne\r\nto contract till the proper time. I knew one female who miscarried\r\n_twenty-one times_ in succession, getting gradually nearer to the full\r\nperiod each time, till at last she reached _nine months_, and was\r\nrewarded with a living child.\r\n\r\nSometimes the accident may be produced by a uterine tumor, by a great\r\nquantity of water in the womb, or even by there being more than one\r\nchild, because in either of these cases there is required more room\r\nthan ordinary; and of course from the greater expansion required, the\r\nliability is increased. Various womb diseases may also be mentioned\r\nas causes, or adhesions of its walls or ligaments to the walls of\r\nthe abdomen, and also a diseased state of the placenta. The pressure\r\nof corsets and tight dresses also not unfrequently lead to the same\r\nresult. Some general diseases undoubtedly often cause miscarriage, such\r\nas measles, jaundice, scarlet fever, consumption, and probably many\r\nothers, particularly those in which the quality of the blood is much\r\naltered, or the nervous power much exalted or depressed. Convulsions\r\nhave already been mentioned as being frequent causes of miscarriage,\r\nand all strong mental or moral impressions. Indeed these last causes\r\noperate more than is suspected, and make it necessary for a pregnant\r\nfemale to be kept as calm in her mind as it is possible for her to be.\r\nI have even known one to miscarry from a fright _in a dream_.\r\n\r\nIt is also a fact, though not generally known, that there are\r\ncertain diseases _of the father_ that may produce miscarriage, and\r\nunfortunately they are of that kind that often remain for a long time\r\nin the system without much external manifestation, so that many persons\r\nthink they are perfectly free from them even while they are working\r\nsuch mischief.\r\n\r\nThe death of the child also is sure to produce miscarriage, and this\r\nmay result from various causes, such as external injuries and violence,\r\nor from remaining too long in the warm bath and thereby causing\r\ncongestion of blood in the womb. Small pox and syphilis in the mother\r\nmay also cause the death of the child, though not always. Many having\r\nbeen born at full term with these diseases upon them.\r\n\r\nIn general the fœtus is expelled very soon after it dies, but\r\noccasionally it is retained for a considerable time, and may not\r\npass away till it is completely decayed. It has even been known to\r\nbecome almost fluid, and several months elapse before it was entirely\r\nexpelled. Most women know when it dies, by its seeming to fall down to\r\nthe bottom of the abdomen, like a dull weight, and also by its feeling\r\nvery _cold_. Very often, however, there is no indication of its death\r\nwhatever. M. Chailly mentions a case where the embryo died, probably\r\nwhen about fifteen days old, but the placenta continued to grow, and\r\nthe lady was delivered when about six months and a half gone of the\r\ndead embryo, only about a quarter of an inch in length, though the\r\nafter-birth was nearly large enough for one of the usual size. In this\r\ncase it had died but not decayed, and remained in the womb six months\r\nand a half. In cases of twins also, one will sometimes die at an early\r\nperiod, but remain till the other is born at full term.\r\n\r\nThe _growth of the placenta over the mouth of the womb_, and _shortness\r\nof the chord_, have already been referred to as causes both of flooding\r\nand miscarriage; and to these may be added monstrous or deformed\r\nfœtuses, which rarely reach the full term.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there are many constitutional and individual\r\npeculiarities predisposing to miscarriage, with which we are not\r\nmuch acquainted, and which may account for the constant occurrence\r\nof that accident in many females, notwithstanding all we can do. A\r\n_scrofulous_ taint is with good reason supposed to be one of these, and\r\nit is probable that the _disease of the placenta_, and its consequent\r\nseparation from the womb, before referred to, is mostly caused by a\r\ntaint of this kind. In many instances, where a female has miscarried\r\nfrom no apparent cause, if the placenta be carefully examined it will\r\nbe found dotted here and there with diseased spots, sometimes _like\r\nscrofulous sores_! It is advisable always to ascertain this, and to\r\ncarefully examine the fœtus and its appendages. In all cases the advice\r\nI gave to _keep from being pregnant for some time_, will be found most\r\nlikely to succeed in averting the accident, both because it gives the\r\nwomb time to regain its strength and break through its _habit_, and\r\nalso because it gives us time to operate upon the constitutional taint,\r\nif there be reason to suppose it exists.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, but one often observed, that _living in certain\r\nlocalities_ even predisposes to miscarriage. There is a certain\r\ndistrict in France where the females are so liable to it, that all who\r\ncan do so leave the place when they become pregnant, and thus escape\r\nthe greater risk. Miscarriage also becomes epidemic at certain times,\r\nand prevails like contagious diseases; several instances of this are\r\nrecorded in history.\r\n\r\nBleeding is also supposed to be a cause of abortion, and probably\r\nit may lead to it in certain states of the system, but by no means\r\nso certainly as many suppose. Instances have been known of pregnant\r\nfemales being bled from ten to twenty times without any evil result,\r\neven though carried so far as to make them faint. Mauriceau tells us\r\nof one who was bled _ninety_ times, and yet was delivered of a healthy\r\nliving child at full term. In like manner many other ordinary causes\r\nof abortion will often fail entirely of their usual effects. Thus\r\nMauriceau informs us that a female seven months gone fell upon the\r\nhard pavement from _a three story window_ and broke her arm, but yet\r\ndid not miscarry. Madame Lachapelle also tells us of a young pregnant\r\nwoman who threw herself down stairs purposely, from fear that she\r\nshould have to submit to the Cesarean operation, she having a deformed\r\npelvis. The fall caused her death soon after, but did not make her\r\nmiscarry. Certain powerful medicines are also taken by some, a very\r\nsmall quantity of which, in most cases, produces abortion immediately,\r\nbut without effecting what they desire, though it sometimes poisons\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIndeed the power which the womb sometimes exhibits to retain its\r\ncontents in spite of the most violent disturbing agencies, is truly\r\nastonishing. Cases have been known even where the womb itself has been\r\nseverely wounded, and yet miscarriage did not take place; as in the\r\ncase of a poor country-woman whom I heard of, who accidentally fell\r\nupon a sharp wooden stake, and run it far into the body, injuring the\r\nwomb in a terrible manner, but strange to say, though far advanced\r\nin pregnancy, she recovered and went safely through her full time. I\r\nhave often known women begin to flood and suffer from dreadful pain,\r\nwith other common symptoms of abortion, as early as the second month,\r\nand yet they went safely the full time, though these signs continued\r\nthe whole time. In some cases the waters have even been partially\r\ndischarged, and yet abortion did not result. M. Velpeau tells us of an\r\ninstance where the bag of waters broke, in a female six months gone,\r\nand one arm of the child even came down into the vagina, and yet the\r\narm returned, the discharge ceased, and she went her full term.\r\n\r\nThe _progress of a miscarriage_ varies according to the time at which\r\nit occurs, and the causes from which it arises. When it results from\r\nany violence or accident, it usually takes place in a short time,\r\nand is preceded by abundant flooding, which comes on immediately.\r\nThe discharge of blood however, is lesser the nearer we approach the\r\nfull term, so that a female six months gone is not in nearly so much\r\ndanger from flooding as one only two or three months gone. The reason\r\nis this, in the early months nearly the whole of the fœtal membranes\r\nare attached to the womb, so that in case of their being separated, it\r\nbleeds from nearly all its internal surface, but in the latter months\r\nthe only point of attachment is the placenta. In the latter months\r\nalso the womb contracts vigorously, and so closes its vessels, but in\r\nthe early months its contractions are comparatively feeble. In those\r\ncases also, where the child has been dead a considerable time before\r\nits expulsion, there is seldom much flooding, the connection between\r\nit and the mother having been more or less destroyed by decay of the\r\nparts. The same result mostly follows a miscarriage from internal\r\ndisease, particularly of the placenta. Indeed in some of these cases,\r\nthe blood-vessels connecting the fœtus with the mother have been so\r\ncompletely destroyed, that no blood whatever could escape from them.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the probable consequences of premature delivery, it\r\nhas already been remarked that it is more dangerous in the early\r\nmonths than the latter. It may also be added that it is much more\r\ndangerous, at any time, when caused by violence of any kind, or by\r\nforcing medicines, than when it occurs naturally. The danger is much\r\nincreased if it occurs during fever, or any eruptive disease, or if\r\nthe patient be suffering from diarrhœa or convulsions. As a general\r\nrule we may say, in all cases, that miscarriage or abortion is always\r\nmore dangerous to mother and child than natural labor, both in its\r\npresent and in its future consequences. During an attack of jaundice an\r\nabortion may terminate fatally in a few hours; and very frequently the\r\ntrouble with the after treatment is very great and long-continued.\r\n\r\nThe treatment in an accident of this kind must vary according as we are\r\nrequired to prevent it, or to remedy the evils that follow when it has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIf an abortion be threatened from any cause, the same general practice\r\nmust be adopted as recommended for _flooding_, the indications being\r\nthe same. I believe myself that in most cases, except from accidental\r\nviolence or internal disease, miscarriage may be averted. I knew a\r\nlady who had miscarried many times, always at the same period, who\r\navoided it at last by simply _preventing constipation_ from the first\r\ncommencement of pregnancy, and by using an enema every evening of warm\r\nstarch and water, pretty thick, with about thirty drops of laudanum.\r\nThis was administered by means of a common injection pipe, just before\r\ngoing to bed, and continued till after she had quickened, and repeated\r\noccasionally after that, if she felt any premonitory symptoms of\r\nuterine disturbance. If the patient be of a full habit, she should\r\nalso, _from the very beginning_, live low, keep the bowels free, and\r\nthe skin in good action, and take gentle regular exercise in the open\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhen all the means used are found of no avail, and it becomes evident\r\nthat the fœtus must be expelled, every endeavor should be used to\r\nassist nature in its removal as early and as safely as possible. For\r\nthis purpose the same treatment, as far as practicable, must be pursued\r\nas in a real labor. If the hand can be conveniently introduced, without\r\nundue force, it may be so, to remove clots, or to take hold of any\r\npart of the fœtus which may present, and assist in its extraction.\r\nIn the early months considerable help may be given, sometimes by\r\nintroducing the finger into the mouth of the womb, with a little\r\nextract of Belladonna, to promote its relaxation, but no _force_ must\r\nbe exerted in doing so. If any part of the after-birth can be laid hold\r\nof it should be withdrawn, but no extraordinary effort must be used\r\nto reach it. Frequently it happens that a portion of the after-birth\r\nremains in spite of all attempts to take it away, and there is a\r\n_possibility_ that it may produce inflammation of the womb, but no very\r\nserious apprehensions need be felt of such a result, providing the\r\npatient is properly attended to in other respects. The retained portion\r\ngradually decays, and passes away, merely occasioning inconvenience\r\nand being very offensive. The danger from leaving it except at a very\r\nlate period, is generally thought to be less than that from using any\r\nforcible means to remove it.\r\n\r\nThe best means for correcting the offensive discharge are cleansing and\r\nantiseptic injections. Warm soap suds are very good, or a decoction of\r\nPeruvian bark in water. Strong _coffee_ is also excellent, or a weak\r\nsolution of chloride of lime. The bowels must be kept free, and the\r\nskin carefully cleansed and well rubbed. On all occasions when the hand\r\ncan be introduced with moderate and safe efforts it should be so, and\r\nthe after-birth removed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it should be remarked, that the tendency to miscarry,\r\nlike many female diseases, is undoubtedly owing, in great part, to the\r\ngeneral debility and weakness which characterizes so many women at\r\nthe present day, and which is brought on chiefly by neglect of their\r\nphysical education when girls, and by their artificial mode of life\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF WOMEN IN CHILDBED, AFTER LYING IN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF CHILDBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUERPERAL FEVER, OR CHILDBED FEVER.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the most serious of all those maladies that so\r\noften follow labor. It appears from medical records that puerperal\r\nfever has been known from very remote times, and that it has\r\nfrequently become _epidemic_, or has spread from one to another,\r\nlike the Cholera. In hospitals this has often been observed, and\r\nalso in cities, sometimes almost every female delivered in the place\r\nhaving been attacked while it prevailed. There is also no doubt but\r\nthat it is _contagious_, or capable of being transmitted from one\r\nperson to another, like small pox. Numerous instances have been\r\nknown where nurses and physicians have conveyed it to all whom they\r\nattended, during a long period after having been with a single case.\r\nOne physician, after attending a case of puerperal fever, lost nine\r\npatients successively from the same disease, before he suspected the\r\ncause, and an old nurse assured me, that when she was a young woman,\r\nshe was the unfortunate means of conveying it to two females whom\r\nshe visited, by merely having been in the room a short time with one\r\nwho was suffering from it. It is therefore highly important that all\r\npersons who may happen to be with a female so affected should not\r\nattend another case of childbirth for some time, and particularly that\r\nthey should not wear any portion of the same clothing they had then\r\non, and that they should bathe the whole body several times. If a\r\ncase occurs in a hospital or other public institution, the female must\r\nbe carefully isolated from all the others, and none of her attendants\r\nmust be permitted on any account, to visit other puerperal patients,\r\ntill after a sufficient time has elapsed, and every precaution has been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe causes that produce this terrible disorder are not very well\r\nunderstood; some of them probably predispose to it before delivery,\r\nor even before pregnancy, while others are connected with labor and\r\nits consequences. Among the former may be mentioned, improper diet,\r\nan inactive life, anxiety of mind, bad air, a damp situation, a full\r\nhabit, or great weakness, the frequent use of stimulants, and _certain\r\nexcesses_! The principal causes operating immediately are difficult\r\nlabors, violent treatment, the use of instruments, tearing away the\r\nplacenta too soon, retention of the lochia, cold, rising from the\r\nbed too soon, depression or excitement of the mind, over exertion in\r\ntalking to and seeing company, and neglect of cleanliness. The most\r\nfrequent cause probably is cold or damp, which checks the lochia and\r\nthe perspiration, and leads directly to inflammation. It is on this\r\naccount that the complaint is nearly always worse in winter than\r\nin summer, and prevails most in low damp situations, and in badly\r\nventilated apartments, or in those insufficiently warmed. In most warm\r\ncountries, and in those of an equable temperature, where the females\r\nremain much in the open air, and use regular exercise, puerperal fever\r\nappears to be but little known.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this complaint appears to be a severe and sudden\r\ninflammation, commencing either in the womb or some of the neighboring\r\nparts, which, if not arrested, rapidly extends to all the organs of\r\nthe pelvis and abdomen, and hastens to a fatal termination with\r\nfearful speed. The precise seat, and place of commencement, of the\r\ninflammation, varies in different cases, but this makes little\r\ndifference either in the symptoms, consequences, or treatment of the\r\ndisease, and it is of but little use to give a separate name to all\r\nthese various forms. Uterine Phlebitis, Metro Peritonitis, Puerperal\r\nMetritis, and Puerperal Peritonitis, are all essentially the same\r\ncomplaint, and identical with what is called Puerperal, or Childbed\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThe disease generally appears from the second to the fifth day after\r\ndelivery, but may be delayed as late as the fifteenth or twentieth day,\r\nor commences as early as two or three hours after; and has even been\r\nknown to show itself before labor came on.\r\n\r\nIt usually begins with headache, general debility, uneasy feelings,\r\ncreeping of the flesh, and chills: then follow tremblings, numbness of\r\nthe limbs, cold feet and hands, with a burning heat in the body. The\r\nabdomen gradually gets tender, so that it cannot bear the slightest\r\npressure, sharp pains are felt in various parts of it, and the patient\r\ncontinually complains of twisting and burning within. She prefers to\r\nlie on her back, with the head raised and the knees drawn up, so as to\r\nrelax the abdominal muscles. Very soon she complains of great thirst,\r\nand cries out repeatedly from the sharpness of the pain; the headache\r\nincreases, and the breathing becomes laborious. Hiccough generally\r\noccurs at an early stage, and is usually accompanied or followed\r\nby vomiting and diarrhœa, but sometimes by obstinate constipation.\r\nThe abdomen continues to swell, and becomes still more tender, the\r\nface is pale, bathed with cold perspiration, and indicates in every\r\nline the anxiety and suffering under which the patient labors. The\r\nfeatures seem to be drawn upwards, and all together, or _pinched up_,\r\nand indeed the whole body seems to _shrink_. In general the lochial\r\ndischarge either stops altogether or lessens very much, the breasts\r\nremain empty or nearly so, and the pulse is weak and irregular. In some\r\nfew cases however, the lochia continues to flow, or even increases,\r\nand the breasts remain full up to the time of death. The urine is\r\nhigh colored and thick, and causes smarting and burning as it passes\r\naway. The tongue furs and becomes pointed, and pale colored. The eyes\r\noften seem much engorged, and the white part become yellow, as indeed\r\nthe skin does over the whole body, owing to derangement of the bile,\r\nand alteration in the character of the blood. In most cases the mind\r\nretains its faculties nearly till dissolution, but there is frequently\r\na vague sense of uneasiness and fear, with great depression of spirits\r\nand weeping. Some even feel assured, from the beginning, that they will\r\nnever recover, and occasionally become delirious.\r\n\r\nThe duration of this disorder varies considerably, though in most cases\r\nit carries off the sufferer in a short time, frequently even in two or\r\nthree days. It may however last five, ten, or twelve days, and has been\r\nknown to do so fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which it terminates is also different in different cases.\r\nThe fluid resulting from the inflammation may either be absorbed, or\r\nsuppuration may ensue, and the matter be discharged, either from one\r\nof the natural passages or from an artificial opening; or it may not\r\nbe discharged at all. Sometimes gangrene or mortification ensues,\r\nand sometimes the inflammation partly subsides and becomes chronic.\r\nWhen it terminates by resolution, which is the most favorable mode,\r\nthe patient begins to improve about the fourth or fifth day; the\r\npains become less acute, the swelling and tenderness become less, and\r\nthe milk, lochia, and other secretions that were suppressed begin\r\nto reappear. The patient is also able to lie either on the back or\r\nsides, and soon feels conscious herself that she is improving. But\r\neven when a turn for the better has decidedly taken place, too much\r\nconfidence should not be prematurely felt, nor should there be any\r\nrelaxation of attention, for the slightest causes may bring back all\r\nthe symptoms with more than their former severity. When suppuration\r\nensues, which is most commonly the case, a mass of fluid forms in\r\nthe womb or abdomen, and is plainly indicated, either by its moving\r\nabout or by a portion escaping from the body. In this case also the\r\npain and tenderness decreases, and the abdomen seems less hard, but\r\nthe pulse becomes weaker, a sense of weight is felt about the womb,\r\nthe extremities become cold, chills come on, and gradually the powers\r\nof the system seem to fail till complete exhaustion ensues. When\r\ngangrene or mortification ensues, the termination is nearly the same,\r\nbut more rapid, and all the above symptoms are more marked. When it\r\npasses into the chronic form, there is but little permanent abatement\r\nin the severity of the symptoms for some time; they partially lessen\r\nat intervals, but return again, sometimes with renewed vigor, and it\r\nremains long a matter of doubt whether the disease has really passed\r\nthe critical period or not. Recovery takes place occasionally in this\r\nform of the disease, but more frequently the patient becomes daily\r\nweaker and more emaciated, diarrhœa and slow fever set in, the vital\r\npowers steadily sink, and at last death ensues. This fatal termination\r\nmay however be delayed for an indefinite period, and may ultimately\r\nresult from Consumption or Dropsy, both of which frequently follow\r\nchronic puerperal fever.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the probable termination of this disease, but little\r\nhope can be entertained that it will be favorable. Nor are there many\r\nindications that can be relied upon with certainty, as to what course\r\nit is likely to take. In general it is favorable when the swelling\r\nsubsides, and the pains abate in severity, and particularly if the milk\r\nand lochia begin to be secreted again. The indications are also good\r\nin proportion as the symptoms are mild, and when there is no great\r\nsympathetic disturbance of other parts of the system. It is regarded as\r\nunfavorable when the pain and tenderness extends over a large portion\r\nof the abdomen, and when the attack commences very suddenly. The danger\r\nis also considered greater in proportion as the disease begins nearer\r\nto delivery; and when its first symptoms exhibit themselves before\r\nlabor it is always considered mortal. It is likewise more dangerous\r\nwith twins than with a single birth, and with first children than\r\nafterwards. It is seldom possible however to come to any probable\r\nconclusion till between the fifth and tenth day, and even then it is in\r\ngeneral a matter of great uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe best treatment of this fearful disease is one of the greatest\r\nproblems in medical science. So many different plans have been adopted,\r\nand with such various success, that the history of past cases affords\r\nbut little reliable data to guide us in future ones. In general the\r\nmost powerful _antiphlogistic_ measures, or those thought most likely\r\nto reduce the inflammation at once, are immediately resorted to, such\r\nas bleeding, purgatives, and cold bathing. Bleeding is in particular\r\nthe great agent depended upon, either from the arm, or by cups and\r\nleeches to the abdomen and vulva. Dr. Gordon, of Aberdeen in Scotland,\r\nwho once met with a regular epidemic of puerperal fever in that city,\r\nassures us that nothing else succeeded in arresting the disorder but\r\ncopious and frequent bleeding, at the very commencement. He carried it\r\nso far as to take _twenty-four ounces_ at once, and he says that when\r\nhe did so the patient was nearly sure to recover, but that at first,\r\nwhen he only abstracted about twelve ounces, she was as nearly sure\r\nto die. In about fifty cases to which he was called in time, he only\r\nlost _five_, and taking the average of all he attended the recoveries\r\nwere about two-thirds of the whole number, which is above the usual\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nIt appears however, from the experience of the most eminent\r\npractitioners, that the bleeding must commence early; that the first\r\nabstraction should not be omitted beyond twenty-four hours after\r\nthe first symptoms of the disease, and should be as much earlier as\r\npossible. With very few exceptions they also think Gordon's standard\r\nof twenty-four ounces not too much. Indeed it is generally admitted\r\nthat if the blood be not drawn _at first_ and in _large portions_, it\r\nhad better not be drawn at all. There may be of course many peculiar\r\ncircumstances that will make bleeding improper, which nothing but\r\nexperience and observation will teach a practitioner, but the number of\r\nsuch cases is thought to be small. The use of leeches meets with but\r\nfew advocates, and certainly they seem to have had but partial success,\r\ncompared with the lancet. Dr. Collins of Dublin depended chiefly upon\r\nleeches and Calomel, but he tells us that in _eighty-eight_ cases\r\n_fifty-six_ died when so treated, while in _fifteen_ that were freely\r\nbled from the arm only _eight_ died. In short it appears that the\r\nbleeding must be carried far enough, _at the very beginning of the\r\ndisease_, to cut it short at once, or it will be of no avail, it being\r\nof little or no use merely to _check_ it! In conjunction with the\r\nbleeding it is also usual to give enemas of starch and castor oil, or\r\nsomething similar, and to bathe the extremities in hot water.\r\n\r\nI know that this practice of bleeding meets with strong opposition from\r\nmany physicians, and that it is objected to by patients generally. I\r\nmyself am as much opposed to it as any one reasonably can be, and I am\r\nwell aware of the numerous evils which follow it, but still it cannot\r\nbe denied that Dr. Gordon's plan has cured a greater number of cases\r\nof _puerperal fever_ than any other yet tried. It is true that many\r\nof those thus cured may have afterwards died of dropsy, convulsions,\r\ntyphus and other diseases _produced by the bleeding_, but then the risk\r\nthey run of dying from these was less than that from the puerperal\r\nfever, and in a choice of evils we ought to choose the least. It should\r\nalso be remembered that some eminent practitioners assert, if this plan\r\nbe adopted _promptly_ and _fully_, it will _always cure_, or at least\r\nwith very few exceptions.\r\n\r\nSeveral other modes of treatment have also been adopted to dispense\r\nwith bleeding, some of which have been much more successful than\r\nothers, though none so much so as we could desire. Thus some\r\npractitioners resort immediately to hot fomentations and sweating\r\nmedicines, or a hot bath if convenient, together with brisk purgatives,\r\nand injections. Some depend upon Calomel in large doses, with leeches\r\nto the groins and vulva. Others again use cold fomentations, and\r\ncold injections both to the rectum and to the vagina. Others again\r\nuse blisters over the abdomen, in conjunction with purgative enemas\r\nand moderate bleeding; but this mode seems to do but little good.\r\nAnother plan is to give about six grains of ipecac, and to repeat the\r\ndose several times, at intervals of an hour or less, in conjunction\r\nwith purgatives and warm fomentations. Turpentine has also been used\r\ninternally and by enema, but seems to have accomplished little good.\r\nPerhaps the most frequent plan after bleeding, is to rub one or two\r\ndrachms of _Mercurial Ointment_ well on the skin, over the abdomen,\r\nevery two or three hours, sometimes for several days regularly; eight\r\nor ten grains of Calomel being also given daily, at the same time.\r\nThis brings on salivation, and in many cases the symptoms begin to\r\nabate in severity as soon as that commences. I am not aware however,\r\nthat this treatment is any more successful than bleeding, nor do I\r\nthink the consequences afterwards, in a case of recovery, are any\r\nless to be dreaded. It is difficult in fact to say what plan can be\r\nbest recommended, even in the majority of cases, and certainly no one\r\nyet tried is applicable to all, on account of the peculiarities and\r\nvarying circumstances of each. If the practitioner or patient is not\r\ndecidedly opposed to the bleeding plan, that has undoubtedly the best\r\nrecommendation, from former success. Next to that perhaps comes the\r\nmercurial treatment, which usually meets with as much opposition as the\r\nbleeding, but which certainly has been frequently found efficacious.\r\nThe other plans have met with but little favor, though possibly they\r\nmight sometimes succeed when the rest fail.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked what I should advise for those who _would not_ submit\r\nto the use either of the lancet or mercury, I should say, commence with\r\na strong dose of Epsom Salts, or Jalap, and repeat it in about five\r\nhours after its full operation. Also apply warm fomentations to the\r\nabdomen, or put upon it a flannel bag full of hops soaked in vinegar,\r\nas hot as it can be borne, and put mustard poultices on the feet, and\r\ninside of the thighs. The hands must also be kept as warm as possible,\r\nand the head cool. The diet should be very spare, and contain nothing\r\nheating or stimulating, and cooling drinks, such as ice water, or cold\r\nlemonade, should be drunk freely. The purgative should be repeated at\r\nleast every day, for two or three days, or more if the symptoms are not\r\nmodified, and the mustard poultices may be regularly used to various\r\nparts of the limbs, for the same length of time. In conjunction with\r\nthese means the breasts should also be kept warm, to promote the flow\r\nof the milk, and injections of starch and castor oil should be thrown\r\nup the rectum daily. The object being, as far as possible, to keep the\r\nsurface of the body warm, and to cool the internal fever, at the same\r\ntime that all the natural secretions are excited as much as possible\r\nto remove any morbid matter that may be formed. It should also be\r\nmentioned that the urine sometimes stops, or at least becomes very\r\nscanty and thick, in which case a little sweet nitre may be given, or\r\nif necessary the catheter must be used. Some bitter tea, as boneset\r\nor chammomile, should also be taken occasionally, and a James's Fever\r\nPowder with it once or twice a day, to promote perspiration; or if\r\nthere be severe pains, a dose of Dover's Powders may be used instead.\r\n\r\nIf the disease passes the acute stage and becomes chronic, the same\r\nmeans must be pursued, and with strict regularity, or there will be\r\ndanger of its again becoming acute. In all cases send for the most\r\nexperienced practitioner _as early as possible_, and whatever his plan\r\nmay be, if his past success proves it to be tolerably successful,\r\n_submit to it_, whether it be bleeding, salivation, or anything else.\r\nIf there be no one at hand on whom dependence can be placed, follow\r\nthe plan I have laid down as nearly as circumstances will allow, but\r\npractise it fully without delay, and till a change takes place. Those\r\npersons who make light of this disease, and pretend to say that this\r\nor that simple treatment is all-sufficient, either deceive themselves\r\nor wish to impose upon others. There are few affections more serious,\r\nas will be evident when it is borne in mind that, on an average, _two\r\nfemales die out of every three attacked by it_. To avoid all liability\r\nto it as far as possible, attend well to the general health during\r\npregnancy, have everything comfortable, clean, and wholesome, during\r\nlabor, and be careful to avoid cold, damp, and all kinds of mental\r\nand bodily excitement afterwards. The assistant also, whoever it may\r\nbe, must be as careful and as gentle as possible, so as to avoid all\r\nviolence or undue force, and _not to hurry nature_. A want of attention\r\nto such simple details has, undoubtedly, brought on many attacks of\r\nthis fearful disease that otherwise would never have been experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST OCCURRING AFTER PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the breasts are liable, from many causes, to become\r\nderanged, and such derangements may lead to serious results, both to\r\nthe mother and the child. It is a common opinion that females who\r\nnurse are not so liable to suffer in this way as those who do not, but\r\nexperience proves this opinion to be untrue; nevertheless, as it is the\r\nduty of mothers to nourish their own offspring, it should be a subject\r\nof careful study to relieve them of this liability as far as possible,\r\nor to assist them when necessary.\r\n\r\n_Galacterrhœa._ This means an overflow, or excessive secretion of the\r\nmilk, which sometimes takes place, particularly in those who do not\r\nnurse. At the commencement of the milk fever, Galacterrhœa needs but\r\nlittle attention, but if it continue to the second or third day, proper\r\nremedies should be applied to correct it. These consist in complete\r\nrest, both of body and mind, cooling drinks, and spare diet. If these\r\ndo not correct it soon, a flaxseed poultice should be placed on each\r\nbreast, and the patient should be made to perspire, either by warm\r\nteas and clothing, or by means of steaming. The bowels should also be\r\nfreely opened with castor oil, or a seidlitz powder, and it will often\r\nbenefit very much to give warm water freely to drink, with ten grains\r\nof nitrate of potash (_saltpetre_) to the pint.\r\n\r\nIn those that nurse it is very seldom the case that the secretion of\r\nmilk is too profuse, unless the child has been kept too long from\r\nthe breast. As a general rule it should be put to nurse in a few\r\nhours after birth, even if there be no milk, because its suction will\r\nmaterially help to bring on the flow. It frequently happens, when the\r\nchild is kept away till the milk comes, that the breasts have swelled\r\nso that the nipple is buried and cannot be laid hold of well by the\r\nmouth, in consequence of which the child does not get nourishment\r\nenough, and the breasts not being well emptied become engorged, and\r\ntheir functions deranged. All this may be avoided by putting it too\r\nearly. Sometimes however notwithstanding every precaution, the flow of\r\nmilk is excessively great, and constitutes a real disease, which may\r\ncause great weakness and debility. In such cases it will generally be\r\nfound that the diet is too stimulating or too rich, or that the bowels\r\nhave been too inactive, and the first step towards an improvement must\r\nconsist in correcting these faults. The skin should also be kept active\r\nby frequent bathing and good friction, and the quantity of nourishment\r\ntaken should not be greater than the mere healthy support of the body\r\nrequires. In particular no stimulating liquors should be used.\r\n\r\n_Agalaxy._--This complaint is the reverse of the former, as it consists\r\nin a deficient secretion of milk. The causes of this deficiency are\r\nvarious; sometimes it arises from a constitutional inertness of the\r\nbreasts, sometimes from insufficient nourishment, and sometimes from\r\nprofuse discharges in other parts. All excesses also tend to decrease\r\nthe quantity of the milk, _particularly those of a certain kind_; and\r\nit is seldom so abundant or lasting either in extreme youth or advanced\r\nage. The appearance of the menses in like manner generally causes the\r\nflow to become less, and it ceases naturally in some much earlier than\r\nin others. Sometimes there is a deformity in the child's mouth, which\r\nprevents its sucking properly, and the milk may stop for want of being\r\ncompletely drawn. The breasts also may be diseased, or the nipple not\r\nsufficiently prominent, and the same difficulty be thus produced in\r\nanother way.\r\n\r\nIn treating agalaxy, therefore, the first thing is to ascertain if\r\nthere be no deformity or disease in either mother or child, which\r\nprevents proper nursing. If there be nothing of the kind, it must\r\nnext be ascertained whether the mother has any excessive secretion\r\nelsewhere, such as diarrhœa, great flow of urine, or heavy sweats; if\r\nshe have, these must be corrected. It must next be seen if she takes\r\nsufficient nourishment, and of a proper kind for her stomach and\r\nbowels. Sometimes a little spiced wine is excellent, or some porter,\r\nwith white meats, and arrow-root milk. If she be of a full habit,\r\nhowever, and makes much blood, the contrary course must be pursued, and\r\nthe diet be made low and unstimulating, while the bowels are kept free\r\nand the skin in good action.\r\n\r\nIn many cases when the nipple is small, it may be much enlarged by\r\ntitillation, just before the child is put to it, after which the\r\nsuction will increase it still more.\r\n\r\nIf the female be advanced in life, or very weak, or if she becomes\r\npregnant, it may be better to procure a nurse than to attempt to\r\nstimulate the flow at all. The appearance of the menses need not\r\noccasion a suspension of nursing, unless it evidently deranges the\r\nsecretion of the milk, or affects the health of the mother; in either\r\nof which cases the child should be weaned at once.\r\n\r\n_Engorgement of the Breasts._--The breasts are liable to become\r\nswollen, or engorged, from colds, blows, hard nursing from the child,\r\nover feeding, and from soreness or excoriations preventing them being\r\nfully emptied. This state may occur at any time, but is most frequent\r\na few days after delivery. In general there is no danger from it,\r\nunless it be very bad or continues too long; it may then inflame and\r\ndischarge, or become permanently hardened. To prevent such accidents\r\nthe breasts should always be sufficiently emptied, either by the child\r\nor by artificial means, and every precaution should be used against\r\ncold or violence. Constipation must also be guarded against, and the\r\ndiet and drink must be carefully observed, so that it be not too\r\nfeeding, or too stimulating. Warm fomentations or poultices may also be\r\nused when the breasts are painful, and a Dover's Powder may be given at\r\nnight, after bathing the feet in warm water, to promote perspiration.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the Breasts._--This is only a more advanced stage\r\nof the previous malady, produced by the same causes, and by want of\r\ntimely attention. Like simple swelling, it may arise at any time\r\nduring nursing, but is more frequent a few days after delivery. As\r\nsoon as the inflammation commences the breasts become red, swollen,\r\nand excessively tender, particularly at one point, which soon begins\r\nto project like a nipple, if the disease is not stopped, and at last\r\nbursts and discharges the contained pus. Sometimes the inflammation\r\nis comparatively superficial, and extends only over a small portion\r\nof the surface, but at other times it goes deep and spreads wide. In\r\nproportion to its extent is the severity of the symptoms, which are\r\nthose of inflammation in general, such as headache, thirst, fever,\r\ngeneral uneasiness, and cutting pains in the part affected.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the abscess is formed and can be plainly discovered, it is\r\nusual to open it immediately, because the longer it remains the more\r\nextensive it becomes, and the larger portion of the breast becomes\r\ndiseased. It is necessary however to be _certain_, before making an\r\nopening, that it is really an abscess on which we are going to operate,\r\nfor sometimes a healthy part of the breast feels very much like one,\r\nand a mistake may easily be made; in fact such a mistake has often\r\nbeen made, and by men of experience too. In the early stage of the\r\ninflammation every effort should be used to prevent an abscess from\r\nforming, by the use of purgatives, sweating medicines, low diet,\r\ncooling drinks, and warm fomentations over the whole chest. Some\r\nfemales practice _cold_ fomentations over the breasts, and with good\r\nsuccess, in the commencement of the inflammation, but it may increase\r\nthe difficulty with others, and, so far as I have seen, is no more\r\ngenerally useful than the other method. The warm bath all over the body\r\nis also very serviceable in a number of cases.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens however, in spite of every precaution, that matter\r\nwill form, and its discharge become necessary. As soon as this is\r\nevident, it should be promoted as much as possible, by hot fomentations\r\nand poultices, till the head of the abscess is sufficiently distinct\r\nfor it to be safely opened. While the swelling is going on the pain\r\nis often very severe, and it should be eased as much as possible, by\r\nusing laudanum in the fomentations, or by putting on an opium plaster.\r\nAfter an abscess has opened and discharged, it should be kept open for\r\nsome time, by little pledgets of lint, to prevent its closing up too\r\nsoon, otherwise a portion of the matter may be shut in by the wound\r\nhealing over it, and another abscess will form. Warm poultices and\r\nlotions should also be used afterwards, to promote the discharge as\r\nmuch as possible, but they should not be used after it has evidently\r\nbegun to cease naturally. In short every means pointed out should be\r\nused energetically in the first stage, to _prevent_ the gathering, but\r\nif it takes place in spite of them, then it should be _hastened_ and\r\n_discharged_ as early as possible, to prevent its extending. After\r\nthis, when it has evidently all escaped, the wound may be suffered to\r\nheal, and the patient must be enjoined to be very careful in future,\r\nfor the same accident will be very liable to reappear.\r\n\r\nSometimes these abscesses become very extensive, and remain for a long\r\ntime. I have known ten or twelve on one breast, and I have known them\r\nto continue open for many months. When this is the case it is much\r\nto be deplored, as it is very likely indeed to destroy the breast,\r\nand may even lead to more serious results. Attention therefore cannot\r\nbe bestowed upon them too early or too unremittingly, particularly\r\nif the female be scrofulous, or of a very full habit. Sometimes the\r\ninflammation attacks both breasts, and at other times only one, in\r\nwhich case every effort should be exerted to prevent its extending\r\nto the other. In many persons the same side is always affected, and\r\nbecomes a scape-goat as it were for the other.\r\n\r\nWhen the means used succeed in scattering the swelling, its dispersion\r\nis usually followed by some critical discharge, such as diarrhœa, or a\r\ngreat flow of urine, or even by profuse perspiration, which shows how\r\nnature operates in removing the diseased matter, and cautions us not\r\nrashly to check such discharges.\r\n\r\nIt is a very serious matter for the swelling to _indurate_ or harden,\r\nas it sometimes will, without either scattering or dispersing, as it\r\nis then constantly liable to become worse again, besides destroying\r\nthe structure of the gland. Every means should therefore be used to\r\nprevent this, by promoting its dispersion or discharge, in the way\r\nalready pointed out. It is also very good in these cases to bathe\r\nfrequently with alum water, or decoction of white oak bark, or even to\r\nrub on some of the _Ointment of Hydriodate of Potassa_, diluted with\r\nan equal weight of fresh lard. A piece as large as a hickory nut may\r\nbe well rubbed on twice a day, for three or four days, but it should\r\nbe stopped immediately the swelling begins to subside, and not used\r\nagain unless it still remains or again increases. In many cases pretty\r\nfrequent friction, with the hand anointed with a little oil, will be\r\nall sufficient, especially if a hot fomentation be used afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Excoriations, or Cracks in the Breasts._--The annoyance from this\r\ncause is sometimes very great, the pain which is experienced when the\r\nchild begins to nurse being so acute that it is impossible for the\r\nmother to allow it to remain. Frequently I have known it compel weaning\r\nmuch earlier than was desirable, and sometimes it has even been so\r\nbad, that the dress could scarcely be borne against the breasts. The\r\nprecise cause of this liability to crack is not known, nor do we know\r\nof any certain means to prevent it. In many cases however I have known\r\nit prevented, to a great extent, by having the nipple gently sucked,\r\nvery frequently, for six weeks or two months before childbirth. This\r\nhardens it, and if a wash of borax water be also used, after each time,\r\nit will be gradually prepared for its proper use. Our means of curing\r\nthis troublesome affection are very limited, and frequently everything\r\nfails that is tried. The mucilage of Quince seed, prepared by bruising\r\nand boiling them in a small quantity of water, rubbed over the sores\r\nwith a soft feather, immediately after nursing, often does much good.\r\nThe mucilage from the tender tops of young sassafras sometimes succeeds\r\nbetter than that from the Quince, and a bruised leaf from the large\r\n_horse-shoe Geranium_, laid on like a poultice, is sometimes better\r\nthan either. A good lotion may also be made with a quarter of an\r\nounce of borax, and a tea-spoonful of laudanum, to half a pint of\r\nwarm water, to be used frequently during the day. Some females use a\r\nwash made of saleratus, with considerable benefit, and others find\r\nrelief from one made of nut galls, or white oak bark. Most of these\r\nmeans however are well known, and many others also, which, like them,\r\nsometimes succeed and often fail. The artificial nipple, or _shield_,\r\nshould be tried if none of these means succeed, and frequently it\r\nwill enable the mother to allow the child to nurse, though it may not\r\naltogether prevent the pain.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that the child's mouth may be diseased,\r\nparticularly with _apthæ_, or thrush, and this may possibly keep up\r\nthe excoriations; in like manner the state of the breasts may also\r\ninfluence the mouth, and therefore the condition of each should be well\r\nascertained when anything is the matter with either.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHOCELE, OR SWELLING IN THE THROAT.\r\n\r\nThis is often observed in childbed, and sometimes even comes on\r\nduring labor. It is usually attributed to cold, and no doubt it often\r\ndoes arise from cold, but more frequently it is owing to sympathetic\r\nderangement, and from violent attempts to swallow during and after the\r\npains. Many females in fact cry out at those times, that something has\r\n_broken_ in the throat, and they fear they are going to suffocate. As a\r\ngeneral rule the swelling gradually subsides in a short time, without\r\nany special treatment, but sometimes it increases and inflames, and an\r\nabscess forms which may become very troublesome, and even dangerous.\r\nTo prevent this it should be frequently treated with warm fomentations\r\nand poultices, till the inflammation subsides, and then with the same\r\nwashes recommended for indurated or hardened breast, in the preceding\r\nsection of this chapter. If the swelling becomes hard, and remains\r\nindolent, the ointment of hydriodate of potassa may also be prepared\r\nand used, as there recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHLEGMASIA ALBA DOLENS, OR MILK LEG.\r\n\r\nThis is a painful tumefaction or swelling of one or both of the limbs,\r\nwhich comes on from the fifth to the fifteenth day after delivery. It\r\ngenerally commences with slight pain, or stiffness, or cramp, becoming\r\nmore painful as it proceeds; but, sometimes, shooting, cutting pains,\r\nof great violence, are felt suddenly, at the very commencement. The\r\nswelling, also, sometimes comes on gradually, but, at other times,\r\nrapidly. In most cases the patient complains of a sudden pain in the\r\ngroin and thigh, which is preceded by a chill followed by fever, and\r\nthen the limb begins to enlarge. Most frequently the lower part swells\r\nfirst, and then it extends upward, sometimes, even to the hip. The\r\nskin, on the swollen part, looks white, shining and tight, as if ready\r\nto break; it is also extremely painful, so that pressure upon it can\r\nscarcely be borne. It looks in fact like a thin bag of skin filled with\r\nmilk, and hence the name _milk leg_, from an idea that it was really\r\nfilled with milk, which had, by some means, reached there from the\r\nbreast. This idea is erroneous, in the sense it is usually taken; the\r\nmilk does not flow into the leg as many imagine, nor is anything like\r\nit to be found there, except a peculiar thin, white matter, when it\r\nbreaks. Still, however, a sudden stoppage of the milk may cause such\r\na swelling, like a sudden stoppage of any other secretion, but in no\r\nother way. It is, probably, most frequently produced by sudden cold,\r\nwhich checks that profuse perspiration into which females gradually\r\nfall immediately after delivery, and so drives the perspirable\r\nmatter within, and causes inflammation and suppuration. A difficult\r\nor prolonged labor may also lead to it, by preventing, for a long\r\ntime, the proper circulation of the blood through the large veins of\r\nthe pelvis, and so engorging those below. Or the veins may become\r\nparalyzed, as it were, by the pressure they have sustained, and so\r\nbecome, for a time, unable to transmit the blood. In fact, both the\r\nveins and lymphatics become engorged, as if tied above the limb, and\r\nexhibit knots and bundles, like bunches of grapes.\r\n\r\nSometimes the fever will occur some days first, and the female cannot\r\ntell what it is owing to, till the swelling comes on; and even this\r\nmay take place so gradually, and with so little pain, that the limb\r\nmay be very large before it is observed. I have known females complain\r\nof a slight fever only, on going to sleep at night, and wake up in the\r\nmorning with a confirmed case of milk leg; and I have known others\r\nstart with a sudden pain in the groin, or hip, and be affected in the\r\nsame way, in less than two hours.\r\n\r\nThe disease usually lasts from a month to seven or eight weeks, and\r\nterminates, either by a gradual resolution, or scattering, of the\r\nfluids, or by suppuration and discharge. When suppuration ensues, there\r\nwill, sometimes, form one or more very large abscesses, which it may be\r\ndifficult to heal, and which may lead to serious results, either from\r\ntheir extent, or from the constitutional irritation they produce.\r\n\r\nThe treatment, at first, consists in warm fomentations, such as\r\nthose of poppy-heads, or hops, with cooling drinks, purgatives, low\r\nunstimulating diet, and occasional doses of James's Fever Powder, to\r\npromote perspiration. This is intended to disperse the swelling, and,\r\nin general, it does so. If, however, the abscess forms and breaks, in\r\nspite of all the means used, it must be treated the same as abscess\r\nin the breast, previously described. In ordinary practice, it is the\r\ngeneral custom to _bleed_ at the commencement of the disease, or to\r\napply leeches to the groin. This sometimes does good, but frequently is\r\nof no service at all, even if it does not make matters worse. I would,\r\nhowever, make the same remarks on bleeding here, as I did in regard to\r\nits use in _puerperal fever_, to which milk leg has a resemblance, in\r\nsome respects.\r\n\r\nAnother practice is to use tight bandages, the same as for varicose\r\nveins, but I think the plan is not, in general, a successful one,\r\nthough it may be occasionally. Plunging the limb in cold water,\r\nor keeping it wrapped in cold wet cloths, has succeeded much more\r\nfrequently, and is, with some, a favorite remedy. Stramonium leaves\r\nboiled in vinegar, and laid on hot, will also effect a cure sometimes;\r\nand so will bathing with hot lye or alcohol. A large poultice of hops,\r\nsoaked in hot vinegar, has also been found useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROUBLE WITH THE URINE.\r\n\r\nThe bladder, from its position, is very apt to be inconveniently\r\npressed during the passage of the child, and to be temporarily affected\r\nfor a short time after, in consequence. Sometimes, the neck of the\r\nbladder will be _paralyzed_, and the urine cannot be discharged. In\r\nthis case, fomentations of warm milk and laudanum must be used, or a\r\nwarm hip bath, if there be no danger of flooding, and the bowels must\r\nbe freely opened. If this does not relieve, the catheter must be used,\r\nand always before the bladder is too full. To avoid its becoming so,\r\nthe attendant should inquire of the female, during the first day, if\r\nshe has urinated, or feels any inclination that way, so that he may\r\nknow in time if the difficulty exists. In general, this paralysis\r\npasses off in the course of a day, but may endure longer sometimes;\r\nin which case the patient herself should speak of it. Cases have been\r\nknown where the bladder has become so full as to _burst_ through\r\ninattention to this matter. The contrary difficulty is occasionally\r\nobserved, and the urine cannot be retained, but it flows away as fast\r\nas it is secreted. It is very seldom, however, that this state remains\r\nmore than a single day and, more frequently only a few hours. A dash of\r\ncold water on the pubes, and against the meatus urinarius, has often\r\ncorrected it at once, and so has a single purgative dose. If it remain\r\nafter the first two days without amendment, it is customary to put a\r\nsmall blister on the abdomen, which usually relieves in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nON PREVENTING PAIN IN CHILDBIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF CHLOROFORM IN MIDWIFERY.\r\n\r\nAN ENQUIRY INTO THE UTILITY AND PROPRIETY OF PREVENTING THE PAIN AND\r\nSUFFERING WHICH USUALLY ATTENDS CHILDBIRTH, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE\r\nMEANS TO BE EMPLOYED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to this work I remarked that a great part, and, perhaps,\r\nnearly the whole, of the suffering and danger to which parturient\r\nfemales are exposed, arises, undoubtedly, from their bad physical\r\neducation and mode of life; and that, in a more rational state of\r\nexistence, it was probable that both would be so slight as to excite no\r\napprehension. This improved state of things is much to be desired, and\r\nshould, of course, be striven for by all friends of humanity. But, in\r\nthe mean time, it is proper to consider whether there are any means by\r\nwhich those now living can be relieved in their hours of distress. The\r\nagony which many females endure at this time is so great that there are\r\nfew circumstances under which relief is more needed, or would be more\r\nacceptable; and I, for one, cannot subscribe to the doctrine that such\r\nrelief would be improper, unless it prove to be injurious. There are\r\nsome persons, I know, who say that this suffering has been _ordained_\r\nfor woman, and that it _ought to be_ endured. This notion, I think,\r\nneeds no refutation, it being just as unreasonable as to say that the\r\nsick should be allowed to suffer and die without assistance, because\r\n_their_ condition has been ordained. There are others, and men of\r\nscience, too, who think that the pains of childbirth are necessary to\r\nits safe accomplishment, and that they are also valuable in a _moral_\r\npoint of view. This opinion will be examined by and by, and the facts\r\non which it is founded, carefully analyzed; but it is first necessary\r\nto state the means of prevention usually employed, and to note their\r\nmode of action, and effects.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, a celebrated physiologist, who supposed that the chief\r\ncause of pain and difficulty in labor was the size and hardness of the\r\nchild's _bones_, advanced the theory that if these bones were less\r\ndeveloped, and softer, the pain and difficulty would be materially\r\nlessened, if not entirely removed. He proposed, therefore, since the\r\nhardness of the bones is caused by the deposition of _lime_ in them,\r\nwhich is derived, of course, from the blood of the mother, that she\r\nshould avoid taking anything to eat or drink, during pregnancy, that\r\ncontained lime. This, he supposed, would keep the bones of the child\r\nsoft till after birth, and so allow them to give way and crush together\r\nduring delivery, and thus prevent the suffering and difficulty usually\r\nexperienced. It was also thought that the bones of the mother would be\r\npartially softened at the same time, and give way a little, so as to\r\nfacilitate the process still more.\r\n\r\nI am not aware, however, that this theory has ever succeeded in\r\npractice, either in the human species or in the lower animals, though\r\nfrequently tried. Nature will work on her own plan, and will develop\r\nthe bones of the fœtus, while in the womb, to a certain extent,\r\nproviding she has the means to do so; and if these are withheld, she\r\nis very likely to suspend its development altogether, rather than send\r\nit forth imperfect. I have known cases where everything was withheld,\r\nfor the whole period, that contained a particle of lime, and yet the\r\nchild's bones were as hard at birth as in any other case; the material\r\nbeing, probably, taken from the bones of the mother, which might be\r\nthus weakened, and made liable to displacement, without any good result\r\nwhatever. It is also a question whether such a course, supposing it\r\nto succeed, might not be dangerous in another way, by causing an\r\nimperfection in the child which its future growth could not overcome.\r\nI have known some cases where this practice appeared to have caused\r\nabortion from imperfect development, and several others in which there\r\nwas too much reason to fear that the child was injured, though safely\r\nborn. As this is, therefore, at best, a very uncertain and ineffective\r\nprocess, and is also, probably, dangerous to the mother or child, or\r\nboth, it does not appear to me worthy of further attention, and I\r\nmerely allude to it in order to make the present sketch of such means\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe other means are such as do not interfere, in any way, with the\r\nnatural processes, but merely prevent sensation or feeling at the\r\ntime of delivery. _Mesmerism_ has been recommended, and, in some few\r\ninstances, tried, for this purpose, but its success has either been so\r\nsmall, or its action so uncertain, that no dependance can be placed\r\nupon it, notwithstanding many persons assert its power. Opium and other\r\npowerful drugs have also been given, but so much of them is required,\r\nat that time, to produce a sufficient effect, that their use becomes\r\ndangerous. Other substances, in the form of _vapour_, or _gas_, have\r\nalso been used, the effects of which only last for a short time, and\r\nare not, generally speaking, at all dangerous. Among them may be\r\nmentioned nitrous oxide, or _laughing gas_, carbonic acid, sulphuric\r\nether, and chloric ether, all of which were first employed in severe\r\nsurgical operations.\r\n\r\nThe success of these agents, especially _ether_ and _chloroform_, in\r\n_preventing pain_, is undoubted; nor do they appear to have any other\r\neffect, nor to prevent any necessary effort or process of nature,\r\nexcept in a few cases which will be mentioned further on. Many hundred\r\noperations of the most severe kind, such as cutting off limbs, removing\r\ntumors, stones, and so forth, have been performed while the patients\r\nwere under the influence of these agents, and without causing them\r\n_the slightest pain_; in fact, many remain, during the whole process,\r\nin a pleasant dream, and cannot be persuaded, when they wake, that\r\nthe dreaded operation is over. The same thing has also been observed\r\nin hundreds of cases of midwifery, both in natural labor and when\r\ninstruments have been used. In numerous instances the female has been\r\n_put to sleep_, and safely delivered, without knowing or feeling\r\nanything whatever, during the whole time; the first intimation that\r\nshe had become a mother, being the cheering cry of her newborn babe.\r\nIn some instances, the state of insensibility has been continued for a\r\nlong time, and during its continuance, the most hazardous operations\r\nhave been safely performed.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be safely judged, from the limited time during which such\r\nmeans have been used, it appears that there is no danger whatever,\r\nfrom their employment, except when improperly administered, and in\r\ncertain peculiar conditions of the system; which causes of danger\r\nwill, of course, be removed by competent experience and knowledge. It\r\nis highly encouraging however, to note, though ether and chloroform\r\nhave both been used so extensively and indiscriminately, both by those\r\nwho understood their nature and those who did not, that the cases in\r\nwhich they are proved to have done injury, are _not more than two or\r\nthree_; and in all those that I have heard of, some obvious impropriety\r\nhad been committed in their use. It should be borne in mind, however,\r\nthat even if the danger from them was considerable, we might still be\r\njustified in their use. It is well known that, in numerous cases, the\r\n_fear_ of suffering, beforehand, and its severity while being endured,\r\nproduce the most serious, and even fatal results. Many a patient has\r\npassed safely through the ordinary effects of a painful operation,\r\nand yet sunk from the mere effects of _fear_ and physical suffering.\r\nInstances have even been known in which a fear of this kind has caused\r\n_death_, and frequently it has given a shock from which the patient\r\nnever fully recovered. There is also, frequently, great danger from the\r\nviolent efforts and struggles of a person in pain, and many necessary\r\noperations are even prevented altogether by them; this is often\r\nobserved in difficult labors. When insensibility is produced, however,\r\nall these causes of difficulty and danger are removed; the patient's\r\n_fears_ are quieted, suffering is entirely prevented, and there is no\r\nstruggling to prevent the necessary assistance. Supposing, therefore,\r\nthat the ill effects of these agents were more certain and greater in\r\namount than has yet appeared, it would still be a question whether the\r\nevil they really prevent is not greater than that which they possibly\r\n_may_ cause.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the two agents now chiefly used, _ether and chloroform_,\r\nthere is no difference in their mode of action, but the chloroform\r\nappears to be more speedy, certain, and efficacious, and is,\r\ntherefore, the most valuable, but proportionably more dangerous when\r\nimproperly administered. There are numerous instruments or _inhalers_,\r\nfor administering these vapors, most of which are both costly and\r\ncomplicated, and all of which may be easily dispensed with. A very good\r\nplan is to take a large sponge and dip it in hot water, then squeeze\r\nout the water and pour on the ether or chloroform, and hold it over the\r\nmouth and nose. In two or three minutes consciousness and feeling will\r\nboth be gone, and the patient will sink into a calm sleep which will\r\nlast sometimes ten or fifteen minutes, and may be kept up as long as\r\ndesired, by putting the sponge to the mouth for a few minutes whenever\r\nthere are signs of waking. When it is left off the patient gradually\r\ncomes round as if waking from ordinary sleep, and frequently speaks of\r\nhaving been in a dream, sometimes of a very pleasant character, but\r\nnever knows what has taken place. No ill effects follow, but sometimes\r\nthere is a little drowsiness or stiffness of the limbs, which soon\r\npasses off. A pocket handkerchief soaked in the fluid, and held over\r\nthe mouth and nose will answer equally well; but whatever is used, _it\r\nmust not be pressed close_, because a portion of air ought to enter\r\nwith the vapor to prevent suffocation; and it should also be removed\r\nimmediately the effect is produced. When it is borne in mind how much\r\nthese requisites have been neglected, and how _impure_ the ether or\r\nchloroform has often been, it is wonderful that more accidents have\r\nnot occurred; and the fact that so few have happened under such a\r\nstate of things, and with our little experience, goes far to prove\r\nthat there is little or no danger at all in competent hands, with\r\npure materials. The accounts circulated in the papers of \"_death from\r\nether_,\" and \"_fatal effects of chloroform_,\" have mostly been gross\r\nexaggerations, and frequently false altogether. In most of the cases\r\nwhere death has _followed_ from the use of these agents, it has been\r\nproved to arise from other causes, and would have happened if they had\r\nnot been used. In one or two cases, however, of surgical operations,\r\nthe ether itself appears to have caused death by producing suffocation,\r\nor congestion of the lungs; but, even in these, it has been shown that\r\nit was used in an improper manner. Thus a young woman in Newcastle in\r\nEngland, inhaled ether to have a diseased toe-nail cut off, and died.\r\nIt appears, however, that there was an evident disposition in her to\r\ncongestion or rushes of blood, and therefore she was not a fit subject,\r\nand besides, the ether was poured on a _thick table cloth_, which, of\r\ncourse, prevented the entrance of _air_ along with the vapor, and thus\r\nsuffocated. I believe there is _not a single case_ on record of injury\r\nresulting when due precautions have been used, and I have not heard of\r\none at all in midwifery practice.\r\n\r\n_Ether_ having been the first article used, I shall first give an\r\naccount of its effects, and then proceed to chloroform, explaining the\r\nmode of administration, and other incidental matters, as I proceed. The\r\nbest article on ether which I have met with, is a review in the British\r\nand Foreign Medical Review for April, 1847, of some pamphlets on the\r\nsubject, from which I shall make an extract.\r\n\r\n In the state of perfect etherization we believe all sensation\r\n is abolished; in a less perfect state an obscure perception of\r\n external objects remains, while the sense of pain is extinct. The\r\n psychical state is various. Generally speaking, the sense of external\r\n impressions becomes at first confused, then dull, then false, with\r\n optical spectra or auditory illusions, general mental confusion,\r\n and then a state of dreaming or utter oblivion. In the majority of\r\n cases the mind is busy in dreaming, the dreams being generally of an\r\n active kind, often agreeable, sometimes the reverse, occasionally\r\n most singular; and, frequently, a great deal is transacted in the few\r\n short moments of this singular trance. Many of the patients who have\r\n undergone the most dreadful operations, such as amputation of one or\r\n both thighs or arms, extraction of the stone, excision of bones,\r\n extirpation of the mamma, have readily detailed to us, and most with\r\n wondering thankfulness, the dreams with which, and with which alone,\r\n they were occupied during the operations. The character of the dreams\r\n seemed to be influenced, as in ordinary cases, by various causes,\r\n immediate or remote, present or past, relating to events or flowing\r\n from temperament.\r\n\r\n A good many seemed to fancy themselves on the railway amid its whirl\r\n and noise and smoke; some young men were hunting, others riding on\r\n coaches; the boys were happy at their sports in the open fields, or\r\n the filthy lane; the worn Londoner was in his old haunts carousing\r\n with his fellows; and our merry friend, Paddy, of the London Hospital,\r\n was again at his fair, wielding his shelala in defence of his friends.\r\n Others, of milder mood, and especially some of the women patients from\r\n the country, felt themselves suddenly transported from the great city\r\n and the crowded hospital-ward to their old quiet home in the distant\r\n village, happy once more with their mothers and brothers and sisters.\r\n As with the dying gladiator of the poet, the thoughts of these poor\r\n people--\r\n\r\n  \"Were with the heart, and that was far away.\"\r\n\r\n Some seemed transported to a less definite but still happy region,\r\n which they vaguely indicated by saying they were in heaven; while\r\n others had still odder and warmer visions, which need not be\r\n particularized.\r\n\r\n For the purpose of obtaining information on all the points of this\r\n most interesting subject, we personally questioned all the patients in\r\n the London hospitals, who, at the period of our visits, still remained\r\n in the wards after the ether-operations. They were in all fifty-four,\r\n and the great majority had been the subjects of capital operations.\r\n They were unanimous in their expressions of delight and gratitude\r\n at having been relieved from their diseases without suffering. In\r\n listening to their reports, it was not always easy to remain unmoved\r\n under the influence of the conceptions thereby communicated, of the\r\n astonishing contrast between the actual physical condition of the\r\n mangled body in its apparent tortures on the operating table of a\r\n crowded theatre, and the really happy mental state of the patient at\r\n the time.\r\n\r\nThis perfect freedom from pain is proved by every case wherein the\r\nvapor has been efficiently administered, although there are frequently\r\nthe same cries uttered, and the same motions practised as when pain\r\nis experienced which proves that nothing is prevented but the mere\r\n_feeling_, which it can be of no use whatever for any one to suffer\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n_Chloroform_ has been more recently introduced than ether, but has\r\nnevertheless been used quite as much, or probably more, and, in\r\ngeneral, with still more success. It was first described, I believe, by\r\nProfessor Simpson of Edinburgh, at a sitting of the medical society of\r\nthat city, in November, 1847, and several cases were narrated, two of\r\nwhich I quote.\r\n\r\n I have employed it in obstetric practice with entire success. The\r\n lady to whom it was first exhibited during parturition, had been\r\n previously delivered in the country by perforation of the head of the\r\n infant, after a labor of three days' duration. In this, her second\r\n confinement, pains supervened a fortnight before the full time.\r\n Three hours and a half after they commenced, ere the dilatation of\r\n the os uteri was completed, I placed her under the influence of the\r\n chloroform, by moistening with half a teaspoonful of the liquid, a\r\n pocket-handkerchief, rolled up in a funnel shape, and with the broad\r\n or open end of the funnel placed over her mouth and nostrils. In\r\n consequence of the operation of the fluid it was once more renewed in\r\n about ten or twelve minutes. The child was expelled in twenty-five\r\n minutes after the inhalation was begun. The mother subsequently\r\n remained longer soporose than commonly happens after ether. The crying\r\n of the child did not, as usual, rouse her; and some minutes elapsed\r\n after the placenta was expelled, and after the child was removed by\r\n the nurse into another room, before the patient awoke. She then turned\r\n round and observed to me that she had \"enjoyed a very comfortable\r\n sleep, and, indeed, required it as she was so tired, but would\r\n now be more able for the work before her.\" I evaded entering into\r\n conversation with her, believing, as I have already stated, that the\r\n most complete possible quietude forms one of the principal secrets for\r\n the successful employment of either ether or chloroform. In a little\r\n time, she again remarked, that she was afraid her \"sleep had stopped\r\n the pains.\" Shortly afterwards her infant was brought in by the nurse\r\n from the adjoining room, and it was a matter of no small difficulty\r\n to convince the astonished mother that the labor was entirely over,\r\n and that the child presented to her was really her \"own living baby.\"\r\n\r\n Perhaps I may be excused for adding, that since publishing on the\r\n subject of ether inhalation in midwifery, seven or eight months ago,\r\n and then for the first time directing the attention of the profession\r\n to its great use and importance in natural and morbid parturition,\r\n I have employed it, with few and rare exceptions, in every case of\r\n labor that I have attended, and with the most delightful results.\r\n And I have no doubt whatever, that some years hence the practice\r\n will be general. Obstetricians may oppose it, but I believe our\r\n patients themselves will force the use of it upon the profession. I\r\n have never had the pleasure of watching over a series of better and\r\n more rapid recoveries, nor once witnessed any disagreeable result\r\n follow to either mother or child, whilst I have often seen an immense\r\n amount of maternal pain and agony saved by its employment. And I most\r\n conscientiously believe that the proud mission of the physician is\r\n distinctly twofold--namely, to alleviate human suffering, as well as\r\n preserve human life.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same publication Professor Simpson has another\r\nlist of cases, all equally favorable. In some of these the labors were\r\nprotracted _many hours_, and in others, operations with instruments\r\nwere performed, of the most terrible character, such as would, under\r\nordinary circumstances, have been attended with the most horrible\r\nsuffering. As this article gives an instance of nearly every kind of\r\ndelivery under the influence of chloroform, and contains also some\r\nadmirable reflections upon its employment, I quote it in order to make\r\nthe present account complete.\r\n\r\n CASE 2.--Seen with Mr. Carmichael; a second labor; she began\r\n the chloroform inhalation before the dilatation of the os uteri\r\n was entirely completed; the child was expelled in fifty minutes\r\n afterwards. I kept her under the chloroform for a quarter of an hour,\r\n till the placenta was removed, the binder applied, and the body and\r\n bed-clothes were arranged and adjusted. On awaking she declared that\r\n she had been sleeping refreshingly; she was quite unaware that the\r\n child was born, till she suddenly heard it crying at its first toilet\r\n in the next room. An hour afterwards she declared she felt perfectly\r\n unfatigued, and not as if she had borne a child at all. In her first\r\n or preceding confinement she had been in severe labor for twenty\r\n hours, followed by flooding. No hæmorrhage on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n CASE 3.--Patient unmarried; a first labor; twins; the first child\r\n presented by the pelvis, the second with the hand and head. The\r\n chloroform was exhibited when the os uteri was nearly fully dilated;\r\n the passages speedily became greatly relaxed, (as has happened in\r\n other cases placed under its full influence,) and in a few pains the\r\n first child was born, assisted by traction. I broke the membranes\r\n of the second, pushed up the hand, and secured the more complete\r\n presentation of the head; three pains expelled the child. The mother\r\n was then bound up, her clothes were changed, and she was lifted into\r\n another bed; during all this time she slept soundly on, and for a\r\n full hour afterwards, the chloroform acting in this as in other cases\r\n of its prolonged employment, as a soporific. The patient recollected\r\n nothing from the time of the first inhalations, and was greatly\r\n distressed when not one but two living children were brought in by the\r\n nurse to her. Dr. Christison, who was anxious to observe the effect of\r\n the chloroform upon the uterus, went along with me to this patient.\r\n\r\n CASE 4.--Primipara; of full habit; when the first examination was\r\n made, the passages were rigid, and the os uteri difficult to reach.\r\n Between six and seven hours after labor began, the patient, who was\r\n complaining much, was apathized with the chloroform. In about two\r\n hours afterwards, the os uteri was fully dilated, and in four hours\r\n and a half after the inhalation was begun, a large child was expelled.\r\n The placenta was removed, and the patient bound up and dressed before\r\n she was allowed to awake. This patient required an unusual quantity\r\n of chloroform, and Dr. Williamson, who remained beside her, states to\r\n me, in his notes of the case, \"the handkerchief was moistened often,\r\n in order to keep up the soporific effect. On one occasion I allowed\r\n her to emerge from this state for a short time, but on the accession\r\n of the first pain, she called out so loudly for the chloroform that it\r\n was necessary to pacify her by giving her some immediately. In all,\r\n four ounces of chloroform were used.\" Like the others, she was quite\r\n unconscious of what had gone on during her soporised state, and awoke\r\n altogether unaware that her child was born.\r\n\r\n CASE 6.--Second labor. The patient--a person of a small form and\r\n delicate constitution--bore her first child prematurely at the\r\n seventh month. After being six hours in labor, the os uteri was\r\n fully expanded, and the head well down in the pelvic cavity. For two\r\n hours subsequently it remained fixed in nearly the same position,\r\n and scarcely, if at all, advanced, although the pains were very\r\n distressing, and the patient becoming faint and exhausted. She\r\n entertained some mistaken religious feelings against ether or\r\n chloroform, which had made her object to the earlier use of the\r\n latter; but I now placed her under its influence. She lay, as usual,\r\n like a person soundly asleep under it, and I was now able, without any\r\n suffering on her part, to increase the intensity and force of each\r\n recurring pain, by exciting the uterus and abdominal muscles through\r\n pressure on the lower part of the vagina and perinæum. The child was\r\n expelled in about fifteen minutes after the inhalation was commenced.\r\n In a few minutes she awoke to ask if it was really possible that her\r\n child had been born, and was overjoyed to be told that it was so.\r\n I have the conviction, that in this case the forceps would in all\r\n probability have been ultimately required, provided I had not been\r\n able to have interfered in the way mentioned. I might, it is true,\r\n have followed the same proceeding, though the patient was not in an\r\n anæsthetic state; but I could not have done so without inflicting\r\n great agony upon her.\r\n\r\n CASE 7.--A third labor; the patient had been twice before confined of\r\n dead premature children; once of twins, under the care of Mr. Stone,\r\n of London; the second time of a single child under my charge. The\r\n liquor amnii began to escape about one o'clock, A.M., but without\r\n pains for some time. I saw her between three and four o'clock, with\r\n the pains commencing and the os uteri beginning to dilate. In two\r\n hours afterwards, the third stage was well advanced, and the pains\r\n becoming very severe, she had the chloroform exhibited to her, and\r\n slept soundly under its influence. In twenty minutes the child was\r\n born and cried very loudly without rousing the mother. In about twelve\r\n or fifteen minutes more she awoke as the application of the binder was\r\n going on, and immediately demanded if her child was really born alive,\r\n as she thought she had some recollection of hearing the nurse say\r\n so. She was rejoiced beyond measure on her son being brought in and\r\n presented to her.\r\n\r\n CASE 9.--In the Maternity Hospital; first child. Labor began at 10\r\n P.M., (Nov. 21st.) I was desired to see her at six A.M., (22nd.)\r\n The os uteri was well dilated, but it was evident that the pelvic\r\n canal was contracted throughout, and the head was passing with unusual\r\n difficulty through the brim. The patient was complaining much of\r\n her sufferings. It was evident that it would be a very tedious, and\r\n probably, at last, an instrumental case, and one therefore calculated\r\n to test the length of time during which chloroform might be used.\r\n She began to inhale it at a quarter past six, A.M., and was kept\r\n under its influence till a quarter past seven, P.M.,--the date of her\r\n delivery--_thirteen hours_ in all. From the time it was begun till\r\n the time delivery was completed, her cries and complaints ceased,\r\n and she slept on soundly throughout the day. The bladder required to\r\n be emptied several times with the catheter. The head passed the os\r\n uteri at ten A.M., and during the day, gradually descended through the\r\n pelvis. At seven P.M., I at last deemed it proper to deliver her by\r\n the forceps; the head, which was now elongated and œdematous, having\r\n by that time rested for some hours against the contracted pelvic\r\n outlet, with little or no evidence of advancement; the bones of the\r\n fœtal cranium overlapping each other, and the fœtal heart becoming\r\n less strong and distinct in its pulsations. A warm bath, irritation of\r\n the chest, &c., were necessary to excite full and perfect respiration\r\n in the infant. Whilst we were all busied with the infant, the mother\r\n lost some blood, but the placenta was immediately removed, and the\r\n uterus contracted perfectly. On afterwards measuring the quantity of\r\n blood lost, it was calculated to amount to fifteen or eighteen ounces.\r\n The mother's clothes were changed, she was bound up, and removed to a\r\n dry bed before she awoke. She had at first no idea that the child was\r\n born, and was in no respect conscious of being delivered. In fact, she\r\n had been \"sleeping,\" according to her own account, from the time she\r\n had begun the inhalation, and thought she remembered or dreamed that\r\n she heard Dr. Williamson, the house-surgeon, speak near her once or\r\n twice. Dr. Beilby, Dr. Ziegler, &c., saw the case with me. Three days\r\n afterwards I found the mother and child perfectly well. She continued\r\n to recover so rapidly, that she insisted on leaving the hospital on\r\n the tenth day after delivery.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of such accounts as these could be collected to\r\nfill a large volume; but these are quite sufficient for our purpose.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the objections to using chloroform or ether, in midwifery,\r\nit will be thought by most persons, and with good reason, too, that the\r\nsafety and success which has attended their use, is itself a sufficient\r\nanswer to all objections.\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought, by some physicians, that the expulsive force\r\nof the womb was lessened when the pain was prevented; but this is not\r\nthe case; on the contrary, it has been, in many cases, much increased.\r\nIt was also thought by others that there was more danger from flooding,\r\nand convulsions, than in ordinary cases; but this is also equally at\r\nvariance with truth, for it appears, beyond doubt, after a careful\r\nexamination of all the cases recorded, that there is much _less_\r\ndanger, particularly from convulsions, than when the patient is allowed\r\nto be tortured and terrified by feeling pain. Dr. Simpson remarks in\r\nanother part of the article above quoted:--\r\n\r\n The question which I have been repeatedly asked is this--Will we\r\n ever be \"justified\" in using the vapor of ether to assuage the pains\r\n of natural labor? Now, if experience betimes goes fully to prove to\r\n us the safety with which ether may, under proper precautions and\r\n management, be employed in the course of parturition, then, looking\r\n to the facts of the case, and considering the actual amount of pain\r\n usually endured, I believe that the question will require to be quite\r\n changed in its character. For, instead of determining, in relation\r\n to it, whether we shall be \"justified\" in using this agent under the\r\n circumstances named, it will become, on the other hand, necessary to\r\n determine whether, on any grounds, moral or medical, a professional\r\n man could deem himself \"justified\" in withholding and _not_ using any\r\n such safe means, (as we at present presuppose this to be,) provided he\r\n had the power, by it, of assuaging the pains and anguish of the last\r\n stage of natural labor, and thus counteracting what Velpeau describes\r\n as \"those piercing cries, that agitation so lively, those excessive\r\n efforts, those inexpressible agonies, and those pains apparently\r\n intolerable,\" which accompany the termination of natural parturition\r\n in the human mother.\r\n\r\n Since the latter end of January I have employed etherization with\r\n few and rare exceptions, in every case of labor which has been under\r\n my care. And the results, as I already stated in THE LANCET, have\r\n been, indeed, most happy and gratifying. I never had the pleasure of\r\n watching over a series of more perfect or more rapid recoveries; nor\r\n have I once witnessed any disagreeable result to either mother or\r\n child. I do not remember a single patient to have taken it who has\r\n not afterwards declared her sincere gratitude for its employment, and\r\n her indubitable determination to have recourse again to similar means\r\n under similar circumstances. Most have subsequently set out, like\r\n zealous missionaries, to persuade other friends to avail themselves\r\n of the same measure in the hour of suffering. And a number of my\r\n most esteemed professional brethren in Edinburgh have adopted it\r\n with success and results equal to my own. At the same time, I most\r\n sincerely believe that we are, all of us, called upon to employ it,\r\n by every principle of true humanity, as well as by every principle of\r\n true religion. Medical men may oppose, for a time, the superinduction\r\n of anæsthesia in parturition, but they will oppose it in vain; for\r\n certainly our patients themselves and their friends will force the use\r\n of it upon the profession. The whole question is, I believe, even now,\r\n one merely of time. It is not--Shall the practice come to be generally\r\n adopted? but--When shall it be generally adopted? And, for my part,\r\n I more than doubt if any man (rejecting willingly its benefits) is\r\n really justified, on any grounds, moral or medical, in deliberately\r\n desiring and asking his patients to shriek and writhe in their agonies\r\n for a few months, or a few years longer, in order that, by doing so,\r\n they may defer, forsooth, to his professional apathy, or pander to his\r\n professional caprices and prejudices.\r\n\r\nAnother objection has also been advanced against the employment of\r\nether or chloroform, the force of which must be estimated by every one\r\nfor themselves. It is well known that many, if not most of the lower\r\nanimals during labor, or immediately afterward, _experience certain\r\nfeelings and desires stronger than at any other time_; and it is\r\nsupposed that such would be the case, as a general rule, with human\r\nbeings, if it were not for the _pain_ which overpowers everything\r\nelse. This supposition has, in fact, been partly verified in a few\r\ncases; several females having confessed, after recovering from a\r\npainless labor under the influence of ether, that their dreams during\r\nthe sleep were of _a peculiar warm character_! How far this may be\r\n_generally_ the case, of course, we have no means of ascertaining, nor\r\ndo I consider it to be practically of any consequence to know, because\r\nit can in no way interfere with the safe progress and termination of\r\nthe labor, which alone is what we are properly concerned in. I have\r\nmerely thought it proper to state the fact as being a singular one,\r\nand to make my readers acquainted with it. Physicians are well aware\r\nthat the peculiar feelings referred to are frequently produced by\r\nvarious causes which act on the nervous system, such as _mesmerism_,\r\nand even by _strong devotional excitement_. I have known females with\r\nstrong moral impressions who always carefully avoided _both_ the above\r\ncauses, from having discovered their liability to produce such effects;\r\nin fact, this has been one objection raised to allowing mesmerists to\r\noperate upon young persons, and several cases of moral failing having\r\nbeen attributed to this cause. It is not at all improbable, therefore,\r\nthat such results may occasionally occur during labor, though we are\r\nnot at all justified in assuming that they will in any particular case.\r\nHow far this may be considered an objection to the employment of such\r\nmeans, must be however, as I before remarked, decided by all persons\r\n_for themselves_, and _for themselves only_! It is not a _medical_\r\nquestion at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotices of Dr. Hollick's Lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HOLLICK AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The second of a series of Lectures, by\r\nthis gentleman, on human physiology, and the all important truths\r\nconnected with our physical constitution, was attended by a full\r\nhouse, in National Hall, last evening. The time was well spent, and\r\nso appeared to think the audience. On the delivery of the first of\r\nthese Lectures on Tuesday evening, the speaker in a comprehensive and\r\nwell-digested exordium, placed himself and the subject right with\r\nthe public. His manner, language and style, did the first; his sound\r\nlogic, his argument, his candor and research, accomplished the second.\r\nApart from the interesting and apposite details of the wonders of\r\nreproduction, the illustrations of the immutable wisdom of nature,\r\nwhich teem in the animal and vegetable worlds--which\r\n\r\n  \"Glows in each stem, and blossoms in each tree;\r\n  Lives through all life, extends through all extent,\r\n  Spreads undivided, operates unspent.\"\r\n\r\nApart from all this, Dr. Hollick's Lecture was excellent as a defence\r\nof truth, a vindication of the right of free and unshackled inquiry,\r\nand as a convincing refutation of that silly, but far too prevalent\r\nopinion that there are truths of which it is better to remain in a\r\nstate of ignorance. Had nothing else been imparted in the forcible and\r\nwell defined exordium of Dr. Hollick than this judicious demolition\r\nof that fallacious, silly, but injurious twaddle which would forbid\r\nresearch to pass in advance of the old landmarks prescribed by custom,\r\nignorance, or a spurious morality--even that would well deserve the\r\npublic patronage. Truths, well set forth, will make an impression,\r\nwhether their investigation be fashionable or not. There is an affinity\r\nbetween the capacity to learn, and the truths to be learned, which\r\nalways results, when a fitting opportunity is presented, in a free\r\ninquiry, and the gentleman who is bringing, in a judicious and elevated\r\nmanner, a knowledge of those fundamental principles of our corporeal\r\nexistence which are abused because unknown, will accomplish more good\r\nthan half a dozen teachers of higher pretensions, and lower ability.\r\nIt was gratifying to observe the decorum--the sense of respect for\r\nboth speaker and subject, that was observed throughout the evening,\r\nwhich evidently shows that those who go there are actuated by higher\r\nmotives than mere curiosity; by desires more ennobling than a passing\r\ngratification; in a word, it was clear that those who composed Dr. H.'s\r\nhearers, were men who know and dare to think, and who will profit by\r\nthese most useful discourses.--_New York Herald, Aug. 7, 1844._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF LIFE.--We attended Dr. Hollick's Lecture at the Masonic\r\nHall, on Monday evening, and if we were to say we were delighted, we\r\nshould but feebly express the gratification we experienced. It was,\r\nin fact, a whole series of anatomical lectures crowded into one, and\r\nthat one so divested of technicalities, and rendered so concise, so\r\nintelligible to the most illiterate mind, and withal couched in such\r\ndelicate as well as perspicuous language, that the most fastidious\r\ncould find no fault, nor the idlest curiosity go away uninformed.\r\nThe human figure--a French model, made, we believe, of _papier\r\nmache_--is beautifully constructed, and every trifling organ is not\r\nonly an accurate counterpart of nature, but can be taken apart,\r\nopened, examined, &c., with an ease that renders the study as perfect\r\nas an actual dissection, without the _desagremens_ that attend a\r\nscrutiny of the real subject. We advise all who love knowledge, and\r\nparticularly a knowledge of their physical organization, to attend\r\nthese lectures.--_Phila. Spirit of the Times_, Dec. 4, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a Meeting of the Class attendant upon Dr. Hollick's Select Lectures\r\non the Physiology and Philosophy of the \"Origin of Life\" in Plants and\r\nAnimals, held at the Lecture Room of the Museum, Wednesday evening,\r\nDecember 1, 1844, George G. West, Esq., was called to the Chair, and\r\nSamuel W. Black appointed Secretary.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we have listened with unfeigned pleasure and interest\r\nto the Course of Lectures delivered by Dr. Hollick, and now brought\r\nto a close, and that we deem it an act of justice to him and the\r\ncommunity, to express our entire confidence in his character, ability,\r\nand the manner of illustrating his subject, which, to use the words of\r\na daily journal, \"is couched in such delicate as well as perspicuous\r\nlanguage, that the most fastidious could find no fault, nor the idlest\r\ncuriosity go away unimproved.\"\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a committee of three be appointed to tender to Dr. H.\r\nthe thanks of the Class for his courtesy to the members in affording\r\nthem every facility for obtaining information upon the subject of his\r\nLectures, and that he be requested to repeat the Course at the earliest\r\nperiod consistent with his other engagements.\r\n\r\nPublished in all the Philadelphia daily papers of December 14, 1844,\r\nand signed by _one hundred and forty_ of the most respectable and\r\ninfluential inhabitants.\r\n\r\n(See similar Resolutions, with _over two hundred names_ attached, in\r\nthe Philadelphia daily papers of March, 9, 1844; also of March 16; and\r\non several other occasions.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Philadelphia Daily Papers, Feb. 21, 1845._\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Ladies composing Dr. Hollick's Class, held on\r\nWednesday afternoon, February 19th, in the Lecture Room of the Museum,\r\nthe following Resolutions were unanimously adopted, and ordered to be\r\npublished in one or more of the city papers:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we have listened with great pleasure and interest to\r\nDr. Hollick's Lectures, and are happy to add our testimony to the many\r\nalready recorded in behalf of such Lectures: and regarding Dr. Hollick\r\nas a benefactor of his race, and especially of our sex, we cordially\r\nwish for him abundant success, and ample reward in the consciousness of\r\ndoing good.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we will exert ourselves to induce our female friends\r\nand acquaintances to avail themselves of the great and rare privilege\r\nof obtaining the valuable instruction imparted in these Lectures in so\r\nchaste and dignified a manner.\r\n\r\n           Signed on behalf of the meeting by\r\n  SARAH WEBB, Sec'y.

HOLLICK'S LECTURES.--These Lectures continue to attract much\r\nattention, and are commended by all who hear them. During the past week\r\nDr. H. has given a private Lecture and exhibition of his models to\r\nmany of our prominent Senators and public men, all of whom expressed\r\nthemselves highly gratified, and desirous that another class should be\r\nformed to accommodate their friends who had not attended.--_National\r\nIntelligencer, Jan. 30, 1846._\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HOLLICK is a gentleman of no less knowledge in his profession than\r\neloquence in his means of imparting it, and he is certainly deserving\r\nof great credit and support for his exertions in a new field of such\r\nuniversal importance. We commend these Lectures with the fullest\r\nconfidence to the attention of our citizens.--_N. Y. Sun, Aug. 6, 1845._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LETTERS FROM NEW YORK, NO. 11.\"\r\n\r\n\"* * * * There have been several courses of Lectures on Anatomy, this\r\nwinter, adapted to popular comprehension. I rejoice at this; for it\r\nhas long been a cherished wish with me that a general knowledge of the\r\nstructure of our bodies, and the laws which govern it, should extend\r\nfrom the scientific few into the common education of the people. I\r\nknow of nothing so well calculated to diminish vice and vulgarity as\r\nuniversal and rational information on these subjects. But the impure\r\nstate of society has so perverted nature, and blinded common sense,\r\nthat intelligent women, though eagerly studying the structure of\r\nthe Earth, the attraction of the Planets, and the reproduction of\r\nPlants, seem ashamed to know anything of the structure of the human\r\nBody, and of those Physiological facts most intimately connected with\r\ntheir deepest and purest emotions, and the holiest experience of\r\ntheir lives. I am often tempted to say, as Sir C. Grandison did to\r\nthe Prude--'Wottest thou not how much _in_-delicacy there is in thy\r\ndelicacy?'\r\n\r\n\"The only Lectures I happened to attend were those of Dr. Hollick,\r\nwhich interested and edified me much. They were plain, familiar\r\nconversations, uttered and listened to with great modesty of language,\r\nand propriety of demeanor. The Manikin, or Artificial Anatomy, by\r\nwhich he illustrated his subject, is a most wonderful machine invented\r\nby a French Physician. It is made of _papier mache_, and represents\r\nthe human body with admirable perfection, in the shape, coloring, and\r\narrangement, even to the minutest fibres. By the removal of wires it\r\ncan be dissected completely, so as to show the locality and functions\r\nof the various Organs, the interior of the Heart, Lungs, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Until I examined this curious piece of mechanism, I had very faint and\r\nimperfect ideas of the miraculous machinery of the house we live in. I\r\nfound it highly suggestive of many things to my mind.\" * * *\r\n\r\n    L. M. C.\r\n\r\n[Extract from a Letter in the \"Boston Courier\" of Monday, June 3d,\r\n1844, by Mrs. L. M.

D. We regard this as one\r\nof the most valuable works issued in a long time. It is a complete\r\ngeneral treatise on anatomy and physiology, and the dissected plate\r\nanswers the purpose of a model of the human frame. Dr. Hollick is\r\nentitled to great credit for his laudable desire to disseminate a\r\nknowledge of subjects that are of such vital consequence to all, but\r\nwhich hitherto has been monopolized by the medical profession. We\r\ncommend it to all as a work of great merit and usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Patriot, Baltimore, March 24th, 1847._\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF ANATOMY, &c.--Dr. F. Hollick, whose history as the\r\ngreat _simplifier_ of the human anatomy, so well known throughout\r\nthe country, and whose public Lectures have won for him so high a\r\nreputation, has just published a work which he designates \"Outlines\r\nof Anatomy and Physiology for Popular Use.\" This book contains a very\r\ncuriously and ingeniously arranged plate, which opens by pieces, so\r\nthat the different parts of the organs of the human system may be seen\r\nin all their variety, all of which are fully explained in English.\r\nThe second part of this invaluable work gives a general description\r\nof these organs and parts of the system, under the division of bones,\r\nmuscles, arteries, veins, &c., &c. This work should fall into the hands\r\nof every family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the New York Argus, January 9, 1847._\r\n\r\nNEUROPATHY.--This is a new name, but a good one, being the title of a\r\nwork by Dr. F. Hollick, whose excellent Lectures on various subjects\r\nwill be remembered by many of our citizens. In this work is explained\r\nthe action of Galvanism, Electricity and Magnetism; Homœopathy\r\nand Allopathy are contrasted in theory and practice; Mesmerism is\r\ndiscussed, and other subjects \"too numerous to mention,\" treated in a\r\nmanner at once novel and instructive. Dr. Hollick has also published\r\na work on \"Anatomy and Physiology for Popular Use,\" illustrated with\r\na new dissected plate of the human organization, of most ingenious\r\nconstruction. Of this work we shall have more to say anon. It is no\r\nordinary production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the New York Sunday Times and Messenger, Jan. 10, 1847._\r\n\r\n\"OUTLINES OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, FOR POPULAR USE,\" illustrated\r\nby a new dissected plate of the human organization, and by separate\r\nviews. The work is designed either to convey a general knowledge of\r\nthese subjects in itself, or as a key for explaining larger and more\r\ncomplete works. These Outlines should be in the hands of every body;\r\nand Dr. Hollick, or any one else, is a public benefactor who furthers\r\nthe publication of such able, interesting, and truly important works.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Pennsylvanian, (Philadelphia,) Jan. 26, 1847._\r\n\r\nThe following in regard to two works from the pen of Dr. Hollick, of\r\nthis city, we copy from the Washington Union, of the 20th instant:--\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY FOR POPULAR USE. _By Frederick\r\nHollick, M. D., Lecturer on Anatomy, Physiology, &c._--We regard\r\nthis as an eminently useful publication. It gives in a form far\r\nmore condensed and intelligible than we have before seen, a very\r\ncomprehensive view of the human organization. The dissected plate of\r\nthe human anatomy, which forms an interesting feature of the work, is\r\nto us at least a novelty. The explanations are drawn up with great\r\nsimplicity, and cannot be misunderstood by the general reader, while\r\nthey, with the illustrations, will often serve to render more clear and\r\nprecise the views of scientific and professional students.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Sunday Mercury, New York._\r\n\r\nDR. HOLLICK'S LAST WORK--_The Diseases of Woman, their Causes and\r\nCure familiarly explained, with Practical Hints for their prevention,\r\n&c._--We regard this as an invaluable production, the most useful,\r\nin many respects, which has yet emanated from this distinguished\r\nauthor and practitioner. It is just the kind of work which has ever\r\nbeen wanted, and is just suitable to the excellent purpose for which\r\nit was intended; this it accomplishes most fully, and its extensive\r\ncirculation must be productive of vast practical benefit. It is works\r\nof this nature and CHARACTER which really do good; which exhibit\r\nplain facts in a plain manner, and record in language simple and\r\nintelligible, knowledge of the most vital importance to the health\r\nand consequent happiness of every daughter, sister, wife, and mother\r\nin the land. The work is dedicated to the LADIES OF AMERICA, and we\r\ncongratulate them upon the possession of a friend at once so able, so\r\nsincere and valuable as Dr. Hollick. Burgess, Stringer & Co., of this\r\ncity, are the publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New York Sun says of this Book_:\r\n\r\n\"BURGESS & STRINGER have just issued a most invaluable work, being a\r\ntreatise upon the diseases of women, by the celebrated Dr. Hollick.\r\nWe have thoroughly examined the work, and can say without hesitation,\r\nthat it should be in the hands of every mother who cares for the health\r\nof her daughters, and every woman who values physical and mental\r\nwell-being. Dr. Hollick and his publishers have done a public benefit\r\nby issuing such a book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the New York Sunday Times._\r\n\r\nDR. HOLLICK'S great work, THE DISEASES OF WOMAN, which will be found\r\nadvertised in another column, is truly a valuable production, and\r\nwell sustains the author's well-earned reputation. It is a complete\r\npractical treatise on female diseases, scientific enough for a\r\nmedical man, and yet so plain that every body can understand it, and\r\nso delicately written that even the most fastidious cannot object\r\nto a single passage. Much of the matter it contains is quite new in\r\nthis country, even to medical men, and of the greatest interest and\r\nimportance. The anatomical plates are superb, and the whole book is\r\nexcellently got up. Every adult female in the land should read this\r\nbook; the information it gives would prevent an incalculable amount of\r\ndisease and suffering, if possessed in time; or it will teach the best\r\nway to cure it when unfortunately established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS PUBLISHED BY DR.

It is illustrated in a novel manner, by a\r\n_large colored Plate_ of the Human Organization, which _dissects_ by\r\nmeans of separate layers, _from the surface of the Abdomen down to the\r\nSpine_, showing all the Organs in their proper places, all connected\r\ntogether, and many of them in sections! the whole being colored to\r\nlife. This plate is on an entire new plan, nothing of the kind having\r\never before been invented; it is almost as complete as a model, and is\r\ninvaluable for private study, for teachers, and for Medical students.\r\nThe explanations are familiar, and divested of technicalities: and it\r\nis still further illustrated by separate wood-cuts throughout the work,\r\nand a beautifully engraved portrait on Steel of the author.

The favor they have already met with, and the\r\nextensive circulation they have attained, is proof that they both meet\r\nthe wants of the public and enjoy its approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Boston Mail, March 7, 1848._\r\n\r\nDR. HOLLICK'S SEPARATE LECTURES TO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ON\r\nPHYSIOLOGY.--The importance of adult persons, of both sexes,\r\nunderstanding themselves, and their natural relations, must be obvious\r\nto every thinking mind. The present ignorance on these matters is,\r\nundoubtedly, the chief cause of the vices and sufferings which so\r\nextensively prevail, and our only hope of a beneficial change must be\r\nfounded on a proper system of public instruction. This instruction\r\nis difficult to impart we admit, and there are but few men qualified\r\nfor imparting it. We have no hesitation, however, in saying that Dr.\r\nH. is one of these men. He knows how to preserve in his subject all\r\nthat intense interest which it intrinsically possesses, and yet to\r\ndivest it of everything in the slightest degree obnoxious to censure,\r\nor even distrust. He has a happy faculty of making every thing easy\r\nto be understood, and yet avoiding the slightest approach to undue\r\nfamiliarity. All who attend, express themselves both surprised and\r\ndelighted, and unhesitatingly recommend his Lectures wherever they go.\r\nMany of the most eminent Ladies in our city were among his auditors\r\nlast week, and were unreserved in their expressions of approbation,\r\nboth for the Lecture itself, and for the becoming modesty and true\r\nrefinement that characterised its delivery. The present series, which\r\ncommence to-day, has been anxiously expected, and will no doubt be\r\nnumerously attended by both sexes, but particularly by the Ladies, many\r\nof whom were unable to gain admission last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOLD MEDAL PRESENTED TO DR.
