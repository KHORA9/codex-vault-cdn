To rest therewith content and to neglect the\r\ncarrying of the idea into practice is a weakness still more common. It\r\nis this frequent failure of reformers to reduce their theories to\r\npractice, their tendency to dwell in the cloudland of the ideal rather\r\nthan to test it in action, that has often made them distrusted and\r\nunpopular.\r\n\r\nWith our forefathers the phrase _mens sana in corpore sano_ was a high\r\nfavorite. It was constantly quoted with approval by writers on hygiene\r\nand sanitation, and used as the text or the finale of hundreds of\r\npopular lectures. And yet we shall seek in vain for any evidence of its\r\npractical usefulness. Its words are good and true, but passive and\r\nactionless, not of that dynamic type where words are \"words indeed, but\r\nwords that draw armed men behind them.\"\r\n\r\nOur age is of another temper. It yearns for reality. It no longer rests\r\nsatisfied with mere ideas, or words, or phrases. The modern Ulysses\r\nwould drink life to the dregs. The present age is dissatisfied with the\r\nvague assurance that the Lord will provide, and, rightly or wrongly, is\r\nbeginning to expect the state to provide. And while this desire for\r\nreality has its drawbacks, it has also its advantages. Our age doubts\r\nabsolutely the virtues of blind submission and resignation, and cries\r\nout instead for prevention and amelioration. Disease is no longer\r\nregarded, as Cruden regarded it, as the penalty and the consequence of\r\nsin. Nature herself is now perceived to be capable of imperfect work.\r\nTime was when the human eye was referred to as a perfect apparatus, but\r\nthe number of young children wearing spectacles renders that idea\r\nuntenable to-day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the multiplication of state asylums and municipal hospitals,\r\nand special schools for deaf or blind children and for cripples, speaks\r\neloquently and irresistibly of an intimate connection between civics\r\nand health. There is a physical basis of citizenship, as there is a\r\nphysical basis of life and of health; and any one who will take the\r\ntrouble to read even the Table of Contents of this book will see that\r\nfor Dr. Allen prevention is a text and the making of sound citizens a\r\nsermon. Given the sound body, we have nowadays small fear for the sound\r\nmind. The rigid physiological dualism implied in the phrase _mens sana\r\nin corpore sano_ is no longer allowed. To-day the sound body generally\r\nincludes the sound mind, and vice versa. If mental dullness be due to\r\nimperfect ears, the remedy lies in medical treatment of those\r\norgans,--not in education of the brain. If lack of initiative or energy\r\nproceeds from defective aeration of the blood due to adenoids blocking\r\nthe air tides in the windpipe, then the remedy lies not in better\r\nteaching but in a simple surgical operation.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, in his wildwood play, saw sermons in stones and books in\r\nthe running brooks. We moderns find a drama in the fateful lives of\r\nordinary mortals, sermons in their physical salvation from some of the\r\nills that flesh is heir to, and books--like this of Dr. Allen's--in\r\nstriving to teach mankind how to become happier, and healthier, and\r\nmore useful members of society.\r\n\r\nDr. Allen is undoubtedly a reformer, but of the modern, not the\r\nancient, type. He is a prophet crying in our present wilderness; but\r\nhe is more than a prophet, for he is always intensely practical,\r\ninsisting, as he does, on getting things done, and done soon, and done\r\nright.\r\n\r\nNo one can read this volume, or even its chapter-headings, without\r\nsurprise and rejoicing: surprise, that the physical basis of effective\r\ncitizenship has hitherto been so utterly neglected in America;\r\nrejoicing, that so much in the way of the prevention of incapacity and\r\nunhappiness can be so easily done, and is actually beginning to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of every lover of his country and his kind is due to the\r\nauthor for his interesting and vivid presentation of the outlines of a\r\nsubject fundamental to the health, the happiness, and the well-being of\r\nthe people, and hence of the first importance to every American\r\ncommunity, every American citizen.\r\n\r\n                                         WILLIAM T.

HEALTH RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nHEALTH A CIVIC OBLIGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn forty-five states and territories the teaching of hygiene with\r\nspecial reference to alcohol and tobacco is made compulsory. To hygiene\r\nalone, of the score of subjects found in our modern grammar-school\r\ncurriculum, is given statutory right of way for so many minutes per\r\nweek, so many pages per text-book, or so many pages per chapter. For\r\nthe neglect of no other study may teachers be removed from office and\r\nfined. Yet school garrets and closets are full of hygiene text-books\r\nunopened or little used, while of all subjects taught by five hundred\r\nthousand American teachers and studied by twenty million American\r\npupils the least interesting to both teacher and pupil is that forced\r\nupon both by state legislation. To complete the paradox, this least\r\ninteresting subject happens also to be the most vital to the child, to\r\nthe home, to industry, to social welfare, and to education itself.\r\n\r\nWhether the subject of hygiene is necessarily dull, whether the\r\nstatutes requiring regular instruction in the laws of health are\r\nviolated with impunity, whether health principles are flaunted by\r\nhealth practice at school,--these are questions of immediate concern to\r\nparents as a class, to employers as a class, to every pastor, every\r\ncivic leader, every health officer, every taxpayer.\r\n\r\nInterviews with teachers and principals regarding the present apathy to\r\nformal hygiene instruction have brought out the following points that\r\nmerit the serious consideration of those who are struggling for higher\r\nhealth standards.\r\n\r\n1. _There is many a slip 'twixt the making of a law and its\r\nenforcement._ If laws regarding hygiene instruction are not enforced,\r\nwe should not be surprised. It has been nobody's business to see\r\nwhether and how hygiene is being taught. The moral crusade spent itself\r\nin forcing compulsory laws upon the statute books of every state and\r\nterritory. Making a fetish of _Legislation_, the advocates of\r\nanti-alcohol and anti-tobacco instruction failed to see the truth that\r\nexperienced political reformers are but slowly coming to\r\nsee--_Legislation which does not provide machinery for its own\r\nenforcement is apt to do little good and frequently will do much harm._\r\nMachinery, however admirably adapted to the work to be done, will get\r\nout of order and become useless, or even harmful, unless constantly\r\nwatched and efficiently directed. Of what possible use is it to say\r\nthat state money may be withheld from any school board which fails to\r\nenforce the law regarding instruction in hygiene, if state officials\r\nnever enforce the penalty? So long as the penalty is not enforced for\r\nflagrant violation, what difference does it make whether the reason is\r\nindifference, ignorance, or desire to thwart the law? Fortunately, it\r\nis easy for each one of us to learn how often and in what way the\r\nchildren in our community are being taught hygiene, and how the schools\r\nof our state teach and practice the laws of health. If either the\r\nspirit or the letter of the law regarding instruction in hygiene is\r\nbeing violated, we can measure the penalty paid in health and morals by\r\nour children and our community. We can learn whether law, text-book,\r\ncurriculum, or teacher should be changed. We can insist upon discussion\r\nof the facts and upon remedies suggested by the facts.\r\n\r\n2. _Teachers give as one reason for neglecting hygiene, that they are\r\noften compelled to struggle with a curriculum which requires more than\r\nthey are able to teach and more than pupils are able to learn in the\r\ntime allowed._ While an overcharged curriculum may explain, it surely\r\ndoes not justify, the violation of law and the dropping of hygiene from\r\nour school curriculum. If there is any class of citizen who should\r\nteach and practice respect for law as law, it is the teacher. Parents,\r\nschool directors, county and state superintendents, university\r\npresidents, social workers, owe it not only to themselves, but to the\r\nAmerican school-teacher, either to repeal the laws that enjoin\r\ninstruction in hygiene or else so to adjust the curriculum that\r\nteachers can comply with those laws. The present situation that\r\ndiscredits both law and hygiene is most demoralizing to teacher, pupil,\r\nand community. Many of us might admire the man teacher who frankly says\r\nhe never explains the evils of cigarettes because he himself is an\r\ninveterate smoker of cigarettes. But what must we think of the school\r\nsystem that shifts to such a man the right and the responsibility of\r\ndeciding whether or not to explain to underfed and overstimulated\r\nchildren of the slums the truth regarding cigarettes? If practice and\r\nprecept must be consistent, shall the man be removed, shall he change\r\nhis habits, shall the law regarding instruction in hygiene be changed,\r\nor shall other provision be made for bringing child and essential facts\r\ntogether in a way that will not dull the child's receptivity?\r\n\r\n3. _Teachers are made to feel that while arithmetic and reading are\r\nessential, hygiene is not essential._ Whatever may be the facts\r\nregarding the relative value of arithmetic and hygiene, whether or not\r\nour state legislators have made a mistake in declaring hygiene to be\r\nessential, are questions altogether too important for child and state\r\nto be left to the discretion of the individual teacher or\r\nsuperintendent. It is fair to the teachers who say they cannot afford\r\nto turn aside from the three R's to teach hygiene, to admit that they\r\nhave not hitherto identified the teaching of hygiene with the promotion\r\nof the physical welfare of children. Teachers awake to the opportunity\r\nwill sacrifice not only hygiene but any other subject for the sake of\r\npromoting children's health. They do not really believe that arithmetic\r\nis more important than health. What they mean to say is that hygiene,\r\nas taught by them, has not heretofore had an appreciable effect upon\r\ntheir pupils' health; that other agencies exist, outside of the school,\r\nto teach the child how to avoid certain diseases and how to observe the\r\nfundamental laws of health, whereas no other agencies exist to give the\r\nchild the essentials of arithmetic, reading, and geography. \"We teach\r\n(or try to teach) what our classes are examined in. If you want a\r\nsubject taught, you must test a class in it and hold a teacher\r\nresponsible for results, and examinations are mercilessly unhygienic,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n4. _Teachers believe that they get better results for their children\r\nfrom teaching hygiene informally and indirectly than from stated formal\r\nlessons._ Whether instruction should be informal or formal is merely a\r\nquestion of method to be determined by results. What the results are,\r\ncan be determined by principals, superintendents, and students of\r\neducation. It is easy to understand how at the time of a fever epidemic\r\nchildren could be taught as much in one week about infection, disease\r\ngerms, antiseptics, value of cleanliness, etc., as in five or ten\r\nmonths when vivid illustration is lacking. Physicians themselves learn\r\nmore from one epidemic of smallpox than from four years of book study.\r\nTo make possible and to require a daily shower bath will undoubtedly do\r\nmore to inculcate habits of health than repeated lessons about the\r\nskin, pores, evaporation, and discharge of impurities.\r\n\r\nIf one illustration is better than ten lessons, if an open window is\r\nworth more than all that text-books have to say about ventilation, if\r\na seat adjusted to the child is better than an anatomical chart, this\r\ndoes not mean that instruction in hygiene should cease. On the\r\ncontrary, it means that provision should be made for every teacher to\r\nopen windows, to adjust desks, to use the experience of individual\r\nchildren for the education of the class. If the rank and file of\r\nteachers have not hitherto been sufficiently observant of physiological\r\nand hygienic facts, if they are unprepared from their own lives to\r\ndetect or to furnish illustrations for the child, this again does not\r\nmean that the child should be denied the illustrations, but that the\r\nteacher should either have instruction and experience to incite\r\ninterest and to stimulate powers of observation, or else be asked to\r\ngive place to another teacher who is able to furnish such\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n5. _Children, like adults, can be interested in other people, in rules\r\nof conduct, in social conditions, in living and working relations more\r\neasily than in their own bodies._ The normal, healthy child thinks very\r\nlittle of himself apart from the other boys and girls, the games, the\r\nstudies, the animals, the nature wonders, the hardships that come to\r\nhim from the outside. So true is this that one of the best means of\r\nmitigating or curing many ailments is to divert the child's attention\r\nfrom himself to things outside of himself that he can look at, hear,\r\nenjoy. The power to concentrate attention upon oneself is a sign either\r\nof a diseased body, a diseased mind, or a highly trained mind. To study\r\nothers and to recognize the similarity between others and oneself is as\r\nnatural as the body itself. Teachers are consulting this line of\r\neasiest access to children's attention when they honor children\r\naccording to cleanliness of hands, of teeth, of shoes. Human interest\r\nattaches to what parks or excursions are doing for sickly children, how\r\nwelfare work is improving factory employees, how smallpox is conquered\r\nby vaccination, how insurance companies refuse to take risks upon the\r\nlives of men or women addicted to the excessive use of alcohol or\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nOther people's interests--tenement conditions, factory rules--can be\r\ndescribed in figures and actions that appeal to the imagination and\r\nimpress upon the mind pictures that are repeatedly reawakened by\r\nexperience and observation on the playground, at home, on the way to\r\nschool or to work. \"Once upon a time--\" will always arrest attention\r\nmore quickly than \"The human frame consists--.\" What others think of me\r\nhelps me to obey law--statutory, moral, or hygienic--more than what I\r\nknow of law itself. How social instincts dominate may be illustrated by\r\nan experience in advertising a public bath near a thoroughfare traveled\r\ndaily by thousands of working girls. I prepared a card to be\r\ndistributed among these girls that began: \"A cool, refreshing bath,\r\netc.\" This card was criticised by one who knows the ways of girls and\r\nwomen, as follows: \"Of course you get no success when you have a man\r\nstand on the street corner and pass out cards telling girls to get\r\nclean. Every girl that is worth while is affronted by the insinuation.\"\r\nActing upon this expert advice, we then got out a neatly printed card\r\nreading as follows: \"For a clear complexion, sprightly step, and\r\nbounding vitality, visit the Center Market Baths, open from 6 A.M. to 9\r\nP.M. daily.\" The board of managers shook their sage masculine heads and\r\nreluctantly gave permission to issue these appeals. Woman's judgment\r\nwas vindicated, however, and the advantage was proved of urging health\r\nfor \"society's\" sake rather than for health's sake, when the patronage\r\nof the bath jumped at once to considerable proportions.\r\n\r\n6. _Other people's habits of health influence our well-being quite as\r\nmuch, if not more, than our own._ Because we are social beings, ability\r\nto get along with our families, our friends, our employers, is--at\r\nleast so it seems to most of us--quite as important as individual\r\nhealth. For too many of us, living hygienically is absolutely\r\nimpossible without inconveniencing and bothering the majority of\r\npersons with whom we live. I remember a girl in college,--a fresh-air\r\nfiend,--who every morning, no matter how cold, threw the windows wide\r\nopen. Then, with forty others, I thought this girl a nuisance as well\r\nas a menace to health, but now, twenty years afterwards, I find myself\r\nwanting to do the same thing. Professor Patten, the economist, whom I\r\nshall quote many times because he is particularly interested in the\r\npurpose of this book, was recently dining at my house and illustrated\r\nfrom his own health the importance of teaching hygiene so as to affect\r\nsocial as well as personal standards. \"To be true to my own health\r\nneeds, I ought to have declined nearly everything that has been offered\r\nme for dinner, but in the long run, if I am going to visit, my eating\r\nwhat is placed before me is better for society than making those who\r\nentertain me feel uncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nMost of us know what uphill work it is to live hygienically in an\r\nunhygienic environment. I remember how hard it was to eat happily when\r\nsitting beside a college professor who took brown pills before each\r\nmeal, yellow pills between each course, and a dose of black medicine\r\nafter the meal was over. Mariano, an Italian lad cured of bone\r\ntuberculosis by out-of-door salt air at Sea Breeze, returned to his\r\ntenement home an ardent apostle of fresh air day and night, winter and\r\nsummer. His family allowed him to open the window before going to bed,\r\nbut closed it as soon as he was asleep. Lawrence Veiller, our greatest\r\nexpert on tenement conditions, says: \"To bathe in a tenement where a\r\nfamily of six occupy three rooms often involves the sacrifice of\r\nprivacy and decency, which are quite as important to social betterment\r\nas cleanliness.\"\r\n\r\nTo live unhygienically where others live hygienically is quite as\r\ndifficult. Witness the speedy improvement of dissipated men when\r\nboarding with country friends who eat rationally and retire early. It\r\nmust have been knowledge of this fact that prompted the tramways of\r\nBelfast to post conspicuous notices: \"Spitting is a vile and filthy\r\nhabit, and those who practice it subject themselves to the disgust and\r\nloathing of their fellow-passengers.\" It is almost impossible to have\r\nindigestion, blues, and headache when one is camping, particularly\r\nwhere action and enjoyment fill the day. Our practical question is,\r\ntherefore, not \"What shall I eat, how many hours shall I sleep, what\r\nshall I wear,\" but \"How can I manage to get into an environment among\r\nliving and working conditions where the people I live with and want to\r\nplease, those who influence me and are influenced by me, make healthy\r\nliving easy and natural?\"\r\n\r\n7. _Because the problems of health have to do principally with\r\nenvironment,--home, street, school, business,--it is worth while trying\r\nto relate hygiene instruction to industry and government, to preach\r\nhealth from the standpoint of industrial and national efficiency rather\r\nthan of individual well-being._ Since healthful living requires the\r\ncooeperation of all persons in a household, in a group, or in a\r\ncommunity, we must find some working programme that will make it easy\r\nfor all the members of the group to observe health standards. A city\r\ngovernment that spends taxes inefficiently can produce more sickness,\r\nwretchedness, incapacity in one year than pamphlets on health can\r\noffset in a generation. Failure to enforce health laws is a more\r\nserious menace to health and morals than drunkenness or tobacco cancer.\r\nUnclean streets, unclean dairies, unclean, overcrowded tenements can do\r\nmore harm than alcohol and tobacco because they can breed an appetite\r\nthat craves stimulants and drugs. Others have taught how the body acts,\r\nwhat we ought to eat, how we should live. We are concerned here not\r\nwith repeating the laws of health, but with a consideration of the\r\nmechanism that will make it possible for us so to work together that we\r\ncan observe those laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSEVEN HEALTH MOTIVES AND SEVEN CATCHWORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making a health programme as in making a boat, a garden, or a\r\nbaseball team, the first step is to look about and see what material\r\nthere is to work with. A baseball team will fail miserably unless the\r\ncaptain places each man where he can play best. Gardening is profitless\r\nwhen the gardener does not know the habits of plants and the\r\npossibilities of different kinds of soil. So in planning a health\r\nprogramme we must study our materials and use each where it will fit\r\nbest. The materials of first importance to a health programme in\r\ncivilized countries are men; for men working together can control water\r\nsources, drainage, and ventilation, or else move away to surroundings\r\nbetter suited to healthful living. Therefore the first concern of the\r\nleader in a health crusade is the human kind he has to work for and\r\nwork with.\r\n\r\nSeven kinds of man are to be found in every community, seven different\r\npoints of view with regard to health administration. Each individual,\r\nlikewise, may have seven attitudes toward health laws, seven reasons\r\nfor demanding health protection. These seven points of view, seven\r\nstages of development, are clearly marked in the evolution of sanitary\r\nadministration throughout the civilized world. With few exceptions, it\r\nis possible, by examining ourselves, our friends, and our communities,\r\nto see where one motive begins and leaves off, giving way to or mixing\r\nwith one or more other motives. A friend once asked me if I could keep\r\nthis number seven from growing to eight or nine. Perhaps not. Perhaps\r\nthere are more kinds of people, more health motives, more stages in\r\nhealth progress; but I am sure of these seven, and certain that they\r\nhave been of great help to me in planning health crusades for the state\r\nof New Jersey and for New York City. The number seven was not reached\r\nhit-or-miss fashion, nor was it chosen for its biblical prestige. On\r\nthe contrary, it came as the result of studying health administration\r\nin twoscore British and American cities, and of reading scores of books\r\non sanitary evolution.\r\n\r\nSeven catchwords make it easy to remember the characteristics and the\r\nsource of every motive, every kind of person, and every stage in the\r\nevolution of sanitary standards. These seven catchwords are:\r\n_Instinct_, _Display_, _Commerce_, _Anti-nuisance_, _Anti-slum_,\r\n_Pro-slum_, _Rights_. By the use of these catchwords any teacher,\r\nparent, public official, educator, or social worker should be able to\r\nsize up the situation, the needs, and the opportunity of the\r\nindividuals or the communities for whom a health crusade is planned.\r\n\r\n_Instinct_ was the first health officer and made the first health laws.\r\nInstinct warns us against unusual and offensive odors, sights, and\r\nnoises, just as it causes us to seek that which is agreeable. Primitive\r\nman in common with other animals learned by sad experience to avoid\r\ncertain herbs as poisons; to bury or to move away from the dead; to\r\nshun discolored drinking water. During the roaming period sun and air\r\nand water acted as scavengers. When tribes settled down in one spot for\r\nlong periods, habits that had hitherto been inoffensive and safe became\r\nnoticeably injurious and unpleasant. Heads of tribes gave orders\r\nprohibiting such habits and restricting disagreeable acts and objects\r\nto certain portions of the camp. Instinct places outhouses on our farms\r\nand then gradually removes them farther and farther from dwellings. In\r\nmany school yards, more particularly in country districts and small\r\ntowns, outhouses are a crying offense against animal instinct. In\r\nvisiting slum districts in Irish and Scotch cities, and in London,\r\nParis, Berlin, and New York, I never found conditions so offensive to\r\ncrude animal instinct as those I knew when a boy in Minnesota school\r\nyards, or those I have since seen in a Boy Republic. But the evil is\r\nnot corrected because it is not made anybody's business to execute\r\ninstinct's mandates. In the Boy Republic the leaders were waiting for\r\nthe children themselves to revolt, as does primitive man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nTYPHOID A RURAL DISEASE[1]\r\n\r\n==========================================+============+==============\r\n                                          | Average    | Average\r\n                                          | Per Cent   | Typhoid Fever\r\n                                          | of Rural   | Death Rate\r\n                                          | Population | per 100,000\r\n------------------------------------------+------------+--------------\r\nFive states in which the urban            |            |\r\npopulation was more than 60% of the total |     30     |     25\r\n                                          |            |\r\nSix states in which the urban population  |            |\r\nwas between 40% and 60%                   |     49     |     42\r\n                                          |            |\r\nSeven states in which the urban           |            |\r\npopulation was between 30% and 40%        |     67     |     38\r\n                                          |            |\r\nEight states in which the urban           |            |\r\npopulation was between 20% and 30%        |     75     |     46\r\n                                          |            |\r\nTwelve states in which the urban          |            |\r\npopulation was between 10% and 20%        |     87     |     62\r\n                                          |            |\r\nTwelve states in which the urban          |            |\r\npopulation was between 0 and 10%          |     95     |     67\r\n==========================================+============+==============\r\n\r\nAmong large numbers of persons, in city as well as country, washing the\r\nbody is still a matter of instinct, a bath not being taken until the\r\nbody is offensive, the hands not being washed until their condition\r\ninterferes with the enjoyment of food or with one's treatment by\r\nothers. There is a point of neglect beyond which instinct will not\r\npermit even a tramp to go. If cleanliness is next to godliness, the\r\naverage child is most ungodly by nature, for it loathes the means of\r\ncleanliness and otherwise observes instinct's health warnings only\r\nafter experience has punished or after other motives from the outside\r\nhave prompted action. The chief form of legislation of the instinct age\r\nis provision of penalties for those who poison food, water, or\r\nfellow-man. There are districts in America where hygiene is supposed to\r\nbe taught to children that are conscious of no other sanitary\r\nlegislation but that which punishes the poisoner.\r\n\r\n_Display_ has always been an active health crusader. Professor Patten\r\nsays the best thing that could happen to the slums of every city would\r\nbe for every girl and woman to be given white slippers, white\r\nstockings, a white dress, and white hat. Why? Because they would at\r\nonce notice and resent the dirt on the street, in their hallways, and\r\nin their own homes. People that have nothing to \"spoil\" really do not\r\nsee dirt, for it interferes in no way with their comfort so far as they\r\ncan see. Their windows are crusted with dust, their babies' milk\r\nbottles are yellow with germs. Who cares? Similar conditions exist\r\namong well-to-do women who live on isolated farms with no one to notice\r\ntheir personal appearance except others of the family who prefer rest\r\nto cleanliness. But let the tenement mother or the isolated farmer's\r\nwife entertain the minister or the school-teacher, the candidate for\r\nsheriff or the ward boss, let her go to Coney Island or to the county\r\nfair, and at once an outside standard is set up that requires greater\r\nregard for personal appearance and leads to \"cleaning up.\"\r\n\r\nElbow sleeves and light summer waists have led many a girl to daily\r\nbathing of at least those parts of the body that other people see.\r\nEntertainments and sociables, Saturday choir practice and church have\r\nled many a young man to bathe for others' sake when quite satisfied to\r\nforego the ordeal so far as his own comfort and health were concerned.\r\nStreets on which the well-to-do live are kept clean. Why? Not because\r\nMadam Well-to-do cares so much for health, but because she associates\r\ncleanliness with social prestige. It is necessary for the display of\r\nher carriages and dresses, just as paved streets and a plentiful supply\r\nof water for public baths and private homes were essential to the\r\ndisplay of Rome's luxury. Generally speaking, residence streets are\r\ncleaned in small towns just as waterworks are introduced, to gratify\r\nthe display motive of those who have lawns to water and clothes to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nInstinct strengthens the display motive. As every one can be interested\r\nin instinct hygiene, so every one is capable of this display motive to\r\nthe extent that his position is affected by other people's opinion. It\r\nwas love of display quite as much as love of beauty that gave Greece\r\nthe goddess Hygeia, the worship of whom expressed secondarily a desire\r\nfor universal health, and primarily a love of the beautiful among those\r\nwho had leisure to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n_Commerce_ brooks no preventable interference with profits, whether by\r\ndisease, death, impassable streets, or disabled men. The age of\r\nchivalry was also the age of indescribable filth, plague, Black Death,\r\nand spotted fever that cost the lives of millions. It would be\r\nimpossible in the civilized world to duplicate the combination of\r\nluxury and filthy, disease-breeding conditions in the midst of which\r\nQueen Bess and her courtiers held their revels. The first protest was\r\nmade, not by the church, not by sanitarians, but by the great merchants\r\nwho were unable to insure against loss and ruin from the plagues that\r\nthrived on filth and overcrowding. By an interesting coincidence the\r\nfirst systematic street cleaning and the first systematic ship\r\ncleaning--maritime quarantine--date from the same year, 1348 A.D.; the\r\nformer in the foremost German trading town, Cologne, and the latter in\r\nVenice, the foremost trading town of Italy. The merchants of\r\nPhiladelphia and New York started the first boards of health in the\r\nUnited States. For what purpose? To prevent business losses from yellow\r\nfever. Desire for passable streets, drains, waterworks, and strong\r\nboards of health has generally started with merchants. For commercial\r\nreasons many of our states vote more money for the protection of cattle\r\nthan for the protection of human life, and the United States votes\r\nmillions for the study of hog cholera, chicken pip, and animal\r\ntuberculosis, while neglecting communicable diseases of men. No class\r\nin a community will respond more quickly to an appeal for the rigid\r\nenforcement of health laws than the merchant class; none will oppose so\r\nbitterly as that which makes profits out of the violation of health\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II\r\n\r\nCOST IN LIFE CAPITAL OF PREVENTABLE DISEASES[2]\r\n\r\n=============+============+===========================================\r\n             |            | Multiply by the number of deaths for each\r\n             | Estimated  | age group to learn the cost in life\r\n             | Value of   | capital to your community in loss of life\r\n     Age     | Human Life | from one or all preventable diseases.\r\n-------------+------------+-------------------------------------------\r\n  0-5 years  |   $1,500   |\r\n  5-10  \"    |    2,300   |\r\n 10-15  \"    |    2,500   |\r\n 15-20  \"    |    3,000   |\r\n 20-25  \"    |    5,000   |\r\n 25-30  \"    |    7,500   |\r\n 30-35  \"    |    7,000   |\r\n 35-40  \"    |    6,000   |\r\n 40-45  \"    |    5,500   |\r\n 45-50  \"    |    5,000   |\r\n 50-55  \"    |    4,500   |\r\n 55-60  \"    |    4,500   |\r\n 60-65  \"    |    2,000   |\r\n 65-70  \"    |    1,000   |\r\n 70-    \"    |    1,000   |\r\n=============+============+===========================================\r\n\r\n_Anti-nuisance_ motives do not affect health laws until people with\r\ndifferent incomes and different tastes try to live together. In a small\r\ntown where everybody keeps a cow and a pig, piggeries and stables\r\noffend no one; but when the doctor, the preacher, the dressmaker, the\r\nlawyer, and the leading merchant stop keeping pigs and cows, they begin\r\nto find other people's stables and piggeries offensive. The early laws\r\nagainst throwing garbage, fish heads, household refuse, offal, etc., on\r\nthe main street were made by kings and princes offended by such\r\npractices. The word \"nuisance\" was coined in days when neighbors lived\r\nthe same kind of life and were not sensitive to things like house\r\nslops, ash piles, etc. The first nuisances were things that neighbors\r\nstumbled over or ran into while using the public highway. Next, goats\r\nand other animals interfering with safety were described as nuisances,\r\nand legal protection against them was worked out. It has never been\r\nnecessary to change the maxim which originally defined a nuisance: \"So\r\nuse your own property that you will not injure another in the use of\r\nhis property.\" The thing that has changed and grown has been society's\r\nknowledge of acts and objects that prevent a man from enjoying his own\r\nproperty. To-day the number of things that the law calls nuisances is\r\nso great that it takes hundreds of pages to describe them. Stables and\r\nouthouses must be set back from the street. Every man must dispose of\r\ngarbage and drainage on his own property. Stables and privies must be\r\nat least a hundred feet from water reservoirs. Factories may not\r\npollute streams that furnish drinking water. Merchants may be punished\r\nif they put banana skins in milk cans, or if they fail to scald and\r\ncleanse all milk receptacles before returning them to wholesalers.\r\nAutomobile drivers may be punished for disturbing sleep. Anything that\r\ninjures my health will be declared a nuisance and abolished, if I can\r\nprove that my health is being injured and that I am doing all I can to\r\navoid that injury. No educational work will accomplish more for any\r\ncommunity than to make rich and poor alike conscious of nuisances that\r\nare being committed against themselves and their neighbors. The rich\r\nare able to run away from nuisances that they cannot have abated. If\r\nproper publicity is given to living conditions among those who do not\r\nresist nuisances, the presence of such conditions will itself become\r\noffensive to the well-to-do, who will take steps to remove the\r\nnuisance. Jacob Riis in this way made the slums a nuisance to rich\r\nresidents in New York City and stimulated tenement reform, building of\r\nparks, etc.\r\n\r\n_Anti-slum_ motives originated in cities where there is a clear\r\ndividing line between the clean and the unclean, the infected and the\r\nuninfected, the orderly and the disorderly, high and low vitality. As\r\nsoon as one district becomes definitely known as a source of nuisance,\r\ninfection, and disease, better situated districts begin to make laws to\r\nprotect themselves. A great part of our existing health codes and a\r\nvery large part of the funds spent on health administration are\r\ndesigned to protect those of high income against disease incident to\r\nthose of low income, high vitality against low vitality, houses with\r\nrooms to spare against houses that are overcrowded. To the small town\r\nand the country the slum means generally the near-by city whose papers\r\ntalk of epidemic scarlet fever, diphtheria, or smallpox. Cities have\r\nonly recently begun to experience anti-slum aversion to country dairies\r\nwhose uncleanliness brings infected milk to city babies, or to filthy\r\nfactories and farms that pollute water reservoirs and cause typhoid.\r\nThe last serious smallpox epidemic in the East came from the South by\r\nway of rural districts that failed to notify the Pennsylvania state\r\nboard of health of the outbreak until the disease was scattered\r\nbroadcast. Every individual knows of some family or some district that\r\nis immediately pictured when terms like \"disease,\" \"epidemic,\" \"slum,\"\r\nare pronounced. The steps worked out by the anti-slum motive to\r\nprotect \"those who have\" from disease arising from \"those who have not\"\r\nare given on page 31.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A COUNTRY MENACE TO CITY HEALTH]\r\n\r\n_Pro-slum_ motives are not exactly born of anti-slum motives, but,\r\nthanks to the instinctive kindness of the human heart, follow promptly\r\nafter the dangers of the slum have been described. You and I work\r\ntogether to protect ourselves against neglect, nuisance, and disease.\r\nIn a district by which we must pass and with which we must deal, one of\r\nus or a neighbor or friend will turn our attention from our danger to\r\nthe suffering of those against whom we wish to protect ourselves.\r\nCharles Dickens so described Oliver Twist and David Copperfield that\r\nGreat Britain organized societies and secured legislation to improve\r\nthe almshouse, school, and working and living conditions. When health\r\nreports, newspapers, and charitable societies make us see that the\r\nslum menaces our health and our happiness, we become interested in the\r\nslum for its own sake. We then start children's aid societies,\r\nconsumer's leagues, sanitary and prison associations, child-labor\r\ncommittees, and \"efficient government\" clubs.\r\n\r\n_Rights_ motives are the last to be evolved in individuals or\r\ncommunities. The well-to-do protect their instinct, their comfort,\r\ntheir commerce, but run away from the slums and build in the secluded\r\nspots or on the well-policed and well-cleaned avenues and boulevards.\r\nUptown is often satisfied with putting health officials to work to\r\nprotect it against downtown. Pro-slum motives are shared by too few and\r\nare expressed too irregularly to help all of those who suffer from\r\ncrowded tenements, impure milk, unclean streets, inadequate schooling.\r\nSo long as those who suffer have no other protection than the\r\nself-interest or the benevolence of those better situated, disease and\r\nhardship inevitably persist. Health administration is incomplete until\r\nits blessings are given to men, women, and children as rights that can\r\nbe enforced through courts, as can the right to free speech, the\r\nfreedom of the press, and trial by jury. There is all the difference in\r\nthe world between having one's street clean because it is a danger to\r\nsome distant neighbor, or because that neighbor takes some\r\nphilanthropic interest in its residents, and because one has a right to\r\nclean streets, regardless of the distant neighbor's welfare or\r\ninterest. When the right to health is granted health laws are made, and\r\nall men within the jurisdiction of the lawmaking power own health\r\nmachinery that provides for the administration of those laws. A system\r\nof public baths takes the place of a bathhouse supported by charity; a\r\nlaw restricting the construction and management of all tenements takes\r\nthe place of a block of model tenements, financed by some wealthy man;\r\nmedical examination of all school children takes the place of a private\r\ndispensary; a probation law takes the place of the friendly visitor to\r\nthe county jail.\r\n\r\nMost of the rights we call inalienable are political rights no longer\r\nquestioned by anybody and no longer thought of in connection with our\r\neveryday acts, pleasures, and necessities. When our political rights\r\nwere formulated in maxims, living was relatively simple. There was no\r\nfactory problem, no transportation problem, no exploitation of women\r\nand children in industry. Our ancestors firmly believed that if the\r\nstrong could be prevented from interfering with the political rights of\r\nthe weak, all would have an equal chance. The reason that our political\r\nmaxims mean less to-day than two hundred years ago is that nobody is\r\nchallenging our right to move from place to place if we can afford it,\r\nto trial by jury if charged with crime, to speak or print the truth\r\nabout men or governments. If, however, anybody should interfere with\r\nour freedom in this respect, it would be of tremendous help that\r\neverybody we know would resent such interference and would point to\r\nmaxims handed down by our ancestors and incorporated in our national\r\nand state constitutions as formal expressions of unanimous public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe time is past when any one seriously believes that political freedom\r\nor personal liberty will be universal, just because everybody has a\r\nright to talk, to move from place to place, to print stories in the\r\nnewspapers. The relation of man to man to-day requires that we\r\nformulate rules of action that prevent one man's taking from another\r\nthose rights, economic and industrial, that are as essential to\r\ntwentieth-century happiness as were political rights to\r\neighteenth-century happiness. Political maxims showed how, through\r\ncommon desire and common action, steps could be taken by the individual\r\nand by the whole of society for the protection of all. Health rights,\r\nlikewise, are to be obtained through common action. A modern city must\r\nknow who is accountable when an automobile runs over a pedestrian, when\r\na train load of passengers lose their lives because of an engineer's\r\ncarelessness, when an employee is incapacitated for work by an accident\r\nfor which he is not responsible, or when fever epidemics threaten life\r\nand liberty without check. How can a child who is prevented by\r\nremovable physical defects from breathing through his nose be\r\nenthusiastic over free speech? Of what use is freedom of the press to\r\nthose who find reading harder than factory toil? How futile the right\r\nto trial by jury if removable physical defects make children unable to\r\ndo what the law expects! Who would not exchange rights of petition for\r\nability to earn a living? Children permanently incapacitated to share\r\nthe law's benefits cannot appreciate the privilege of pursuing\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nSucceeding chapters will enumerate a number of health rights and will\r\nshow through what means we can work together to guarantee that we shall\r\nnot injure the health of our neighbor and that our neighbor shall not\r\ninjure our health. The truest index to economic status and to standards\r\nof living is health environment. The best criterion of opportunity for\r\nindustrial and political efficiency is the conditions affecting health.\r\nThe seven catchwords that describe seven motives to health legislation\r\nand health administration, seven ways of approaching health needs, and\r\nseven reasons for meeting them, should be found helpful in analyzing\r\nthe problem confronting the individual leader. Generally speaking, we\r\ncannot watch political rights grow, but health rights are evolved\r\nbefore our eyes all the time. If we wish, we can see in our own city or\r\ntownship the steps taken, one by one, that have slowly led to granting\r\na large number of health rights to every American.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Prepared by Dr. John S. Fulton, secretary of the state board of\r\nhealth, Maryland, and quoted by Dr. George C. Whipple in _Typhoid\r\nFever_.\r\n\r\n[2] Marshall O. Leighton, quoted in Whipple's _Typhoid Fever_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHAT HEALTH RIGHTS ARE NOT ENFORCED IN YOUR COMMUNITY?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws define rights. Men enforce them. For definitions we go to books.\r\nFor record of enforcement we go to acts and to conditions.[3] What\r\nhealth rights a community pretends to enforce will, as a rule, be found\r\nin its health code. What health rights are actually enforced can be\r\nlearned only by studying both the people who are to be protected and\r\nthe conditions in which these people live. A street, a cellar, a milk\r\nshop, a sick baby, or an adult consumptive tells more honestly the\r\nstory of health rights enforced and health rights unenforced than\r\neither sanitary code or sanitary squad. Not until we turn our attention\r\nfrom definition and official to things done and dangers remaining can\r\nwe learn the health progress and health needs of any city or state.\r\n\r\nThe health code of one city looks very much like the health code of\r\nevery other city. This is natural because those who write health codes\r\ngenerally copy other codes. Even small cities are given complicated\r\nsanitary legislative powers by state legislatures. Therefore those who\r\njudge a community's health rights by its health laws will get as\r\nerroneous an impression as those who judge hygiene instruction in our\r\npublic schools from printed statements about the frequency and\r\ncharacter of such instruction. Advocates of health codes have thought\r\nthe battle won when boards of health were given almost unlimited power\r\nto abate nuisances and told how to exercise those powers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A DAIRY INSPECTOR'S OUTFIT]\r\n\r\nThe slip 'twixt law making and law enforcement is everywhere found. In\r\n1864 New York state prohibited the sale of adulterated milk. Law after\r\nlaw has been made since that time, giving health officials power to\r\nrevoke licenses of milk dealers and to send men to jail who violated\r\nmilk laws. We now know that no law will ever stop the present frightful\r\nwaste of infant lives, counted in thousands annually, unless dairies\r\nare frequently inspected and forced to be clean; unless milk is kept at\r\na temperature of about fifty degrees on the train, in the creamery, at\r\nthe receiving station, and in the milk shop; unless dealers scald and\r\nthoroughly cleanse cans in which milk is shipped; unless licenses are\r\ntaken from farmers, creameries, and retailers who violate the law;\r\nunless magistrates use their power to fine or imprison those who poison\r\nhelpless babies by violating milk laws; and unless mothers are taught\r\nto scald and thoroughly cleanse bottles, nipples, cups, and dishes\r\nfrom which milk is fed to the baby. We know that these things are not\r\nbeing done except where men or women make it their business to see that\r\nthey are done. Experience tells us that inspectors will not\r\nconsistently do their duty unless those who direct them have regular\r\nrecords of their inspections, study those records, find out work not\r\ndone properly or promptly, and insist upon thorough inspection.\r\n\r\nWhether work is done right, whether inspectors do their full duty,\r\nwhether babies are protected, can be learned only from statements in\r\nblack and white that show accurately the conditions of dairies and milk\r\nshops, the character of milk found and tested by inspectors, and the\r\nnumber of babies known to have been sick or known to have died from\r\nintestinal diseases chiefly due to unsafe milk. Any teacher or parent\r\ncan learn for himself, or can teach children to learn, what steps are\r\ntaken to guarantee the right to pure milk by using a table such as\r\nTable III. Whether conditions at the dairy make pure milk impossible\r\ncan be told by any one who can read the score card used by New York\r\nCity (Table IV).\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\nMILK INSPECTION WITHIN NEW YORK CITY, 1906\r\n\r\n======================================+===============+===============\r\n                                      |   New York    | Each borough\r\n                                      +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                                      | Stores| Wagons| Stores| Wagons\r\n                                      +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\nFIELD                                 |       |       |       |\r\n Permits issued during 1906           |       |       |       |\r\n Permits revoked during 1906          |       |       |       |\r\n   For discontinuance of selling      |       |       |       |\r\n   For violation of law               |       |       |       |\r\n Average permits in force in 1906     |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\nINSPECTION                            |       |       |       |\r\n Regular inspections                  |       |       |       |\r\n Inspections at receiving stations    |       |       |       |\r\n Total                                |       |       |       |\r\n Average inspections per permit per   |       |       |       |\r\n  year                                |       |       |       |\r\n Specimens examined                   |       |       |       |\r\n Samples taken                        |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\nCONDITIONS FOUND                      |       |       |       |\r\n Inspections finding milk above 50 deg.   |       |       |       |\r\n % of such discoveries to total       |       |       |       |\r\n   inspections                        |       |       |       |\r\n Inspections finding adulteration     |       |       |       |\r\n    Warning given                     |       |       |       |\r\n    Prosecuted                        |       |       |       |\r\n % of adulterations found to          |       |       |       |\r\n   inspections                        |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\n Rooms connected contrary to          |       |       |       |\r\n  sanitary code                       |       |       |       |\r\n Ice box badly drained                |       |       |       |\r\n Ice box unclean                      |       |       |       |\r\n Store unclean                        |       |       |       |\r\n Utensils unclean                     |       |       |       |\r\n Milk not properly cooled             |       |       |       |\r\n Infectious disease                   |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\n Persons found selling without permit |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\nACTION TAKEN                          |       |       |       |\r\n DESTRUCTION OF MILK                  |       |       |       |\r\n  Lots of milk destroyed for being    |       |       |       |\r\n    over 50 deg.                          |       |       |       |\r\n  Quarts so destroyed                 |       |       |       |\r\n  Lots of milk destroyed for being    |       |       |       |\r\n   sour                               |       |       |       |\r\n  Quarts so destroyed                 |       |       |       |\r\n  Lots of milk destroyed for being    |       |       |       |\r\n    otherwise adulterated             |       |       |       |\r\n  Quarts so destroyed                 |       |       |       |\r\n  Total quarts destroyed              |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\n NOTICES ISSUED                       |       |       |       |\r\n  To drain and clean ice box          |       |       |       |\r\n  To clean store                      |       |       |       |\r\n                                      |       |       |       |\r\n CRIMINAL ACTIONS BEGUN               |       |       |       |\r\n  For selling adulterated milk        |       |       |       |\r\n  For selling without permit          |       |       |       |\r\n  For interference with inspector     |       |       |       |\r\n  Total                               |       |       |       |\r\n======================================+===============+===============\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV\r\n\r\n                               Perfect Score 100%\r\n                               Score allowed ...%\r\nFile No............\r\n\r\n                    DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\r\n                 (Thirteen items are here omitted)\r\n\r\n=Dairy Inspection=             =Division of Inspections=\r\n\r\n 1 Inspection No. ......

Thousands\r\nof lives are being lost every year, millions of days taken from\r\nindustry and wasted by unnecessary sickness, millions of dollars spent\r\non curing disease, the working life of the nation shortened, the hours\r\nof enjoyment curtailed, because we have not seen the great gap between\r\nhealth laws and health-law enforcement. In our municipal, state, and\r\nnational politics we have made the same mistake of concentrating our\r\nattention upon the morals and pretensions of candidates and officials\r\ninstead of judging government by what government does. Gains of men and\r\nprogress of law are useful to mankind only when converted into deeds\r\nthat make men freer in the enjoyment of health and earning power. In\r\nprotecting health, as in reforming government, an ounce of efficient\r\nachievement is worth infinitely more than a moral explosion. One month\r\nof routine--unpicturesque, unexciting efficiency--will accomplish more\r\nthan a scandal or catastrophe. Such routine is possible only when\r\nspecial machinery is constantly at work, comparing work done with work\r\nexpected, health practice with health ideals. Where such machinery does\r\nnot yet exist, volunteers, civic leagues, boys' brigades, etc., can\r\neasily prove the need for it by filling out an improvised score card\r\nfor the school building, railroad station, business streets,\r\n\"well-to-do\" and poor resident streets, such as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE V\r\n\r\nSCORE CARD FOR CITIZEN USE\r\n\r\n=======================================================+=======+======\r\n                                                       |Perfect|Allow\r\n-------------------------------------------------------+-------+------\r\n_Schoolhouse_                                          |       |\r\n  Well ventilated, 20; badly, 0-10                     |   20  | ...\r\n  Cleaned regularly, 20; irregularly, 0-10             |   20  | ...\r\n  Feather duster prohibited, 10                        |   10  | ...\r\n  No dry sweeping, 10                                  |   10  | ...\r\n  Has adequate play space, 10; inadequate, 0-5         |   10  | ...\r\n  Has clean drinking water, 10                         |   10  | ...\r\n  Has clean outbuildings and toilet, 20: unclean, 0-10 |   20  | ...\r\n                                                       | ------|\r\n                                                       |  100  |\r\n                                                       |       |\r\n_Church and Sunday School_                             |       |\r\n  Well ventilated, 20; badly, 0-10                     |   20  | ...\r\n  Heat evenly distributed, 20; unevenly, 0-10          |   20  | ...\r\n  Cleaned regularly, 20; irregularly, 0-10             |   20  | ...\r\n  Without carpets, 20                                  |   20  | ...\r\n  Without plush seats, 20                              |   20  | ...\r\n                                                       | ------|\r\n                                                       |  100  |\r\n                                                       |       |\r\n_Streets_                                              |       |\r\n  Sewerage underground, 20; surface, 0-10              |   20  | ...\r\n  No pools neglected, 10                               |   10  | ...\r\n  No garbage piled up, 10                              |   10  | ...\r\n  Swept regularly, 20; irregularly, 0-10               |   20  | ...\r\n  Sprinkled and flushed, 10                            |   10  | ...\r\n  Has baskets for refuse, 10                           |   10  | ...\r\n  All districts equally cleaned, 20; unequally, 0-10   |   20  | ...\r\n                                                       | ------|\r\n                                                       |  100  |\r\n-------------------------------------------------------+-------+------\r\n\r\nUntil recently the most reliable test of health rights not enforced was\r\nthe number of cases of preventable, communicable, contagious,\r\ninfectious, transmissible diseases, such as smallpox, typhoid fever,\r\nyellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough. By\r\nnoticing streets and houses where these diseases occurred, students\r\nlearned a century ago that the darker and more congested the street the\r\ngreater the prevalence of fevers and the greater the chance that one\r\nattacked would die. The well-to-do remove from their houses and their\r\nstreets the dirt, the decomposed garbage, and stagnant pools from which\r\nfevers seem to spring. It was because fevers and congestion go together\r\nthat laws were made to protect the well-to-do, the comfortable, and the\r\nclean against the slum. It is true to-day that if you study your city\r\nand stick a pin in the map, street for street, where infection is known\r\nto exist, you will find the number steadily increase as you go from\r\nuncongested to congested streets and houses, from districts of high\r\nrent to districts of low rent. Because it is easier to learn the number\r\nof persons who have measles and diphtheria and smallpox than it is to\r\nlearn the incomes and living conditions prejudicial to health, and\r\nbecause our laws grant protection against communicable diseases to a\r\nchild in whatever district he may be born, the record of cases of\r\ncommunicable diseases has heretofore been the best test of health\r\nrights unenforced. Even in country schools it would make a good lesson\r\nin hygiene and civics to have the children keep a record of absences on\r\naccount of transmissible disease, and then follow up the record with a\r\nsearch for conditions that gave the disease a good chance.\r\n\r\nBut to wait for contagion before taking action has been found an\r\nexpensive way of learning where health protection is needed. Even when\r\ninfected persons and physicians are prompt in reporting the presence of\r\ndisease it is often found that conditions that produced the disease\r\nhave been overlooked and neglected.\r\n\r\nFor example, smallpox comes very rarely to our cities to-day. Wherever\r\nboards of health are not worried by \"children's diseases,\" as is often\r\nthe case, and wait for some more fearful disease such as smallpox,\r\nthere you will find that garbage in the streets, accumulated filth,\r\nsurface sewers, congested houses, badly ventilated, unsanitary school\r\nbuildings and churches are furnishing a soil to breed an epidemic in a\r\nsurprisingly short time. Where, on the other hand, boards of health\r\nregard every communicable disease as a menace to health rights, you\r\nwill find that health officials take certain steps in a certain order\r\nto remove the soil in which preventable diseases grow. These steps,\r\nworked out by the sanitarians of Europe and America after a century of\r\nexperiment, are seen to be very simple and are applicable by the\r\naverage layman and average physician to the simplest village or rural\r\ncommunity. How many of these steps are taken by your city? by your\r\ncounty? by your state?\r\n\r\n  1. Notification of danger when it is first recognized.\r\n\r\n  2. Registration at a central office of facts as to each dangerous\r\n  thing or person.\r\n\r\n  3. Examination of the seat of danger to discover its extent, its\r\n  cost, and new seats of danger created by it.\r\n\r\n  4. Isolation of the dangerous thing or person.\r\n\r\n  5. Constant attention to prevent extension to other persons or\r\n  things.\r\n\r\n  6. Destruction or removal of disease germs or other causes of\r\n  danger.\r\n\r\n  7. Analysis and record, for future use, of lessons learned by\r\n  experience.\r\n\r\n  8. Education of the public to understand its relation to danger\r\n  checked or removed, its responsibility for preventing a recurrence\r\n  of the same danger, and the importance of promptly recognizing and\r\n  checking similar danger elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith a chart showing what districts have the greatest number of\r\nchildren and adults suffering from measles, typhoid fever, scarlet\r\nfever, consumption, one can go within his own city or to a strange city\r\nand in a surprisingly short time locate the nuisances, the dangerous\r\nbuildings, the open sewers, the cesspools, the houses without bathing\r\nfacilities, the dark rooms, the narrow streets, the houses without play\r\nspace and breathing space, the districts without parks, the polluted\r\nwater sources, the unsanitary groceries and milk shops. In country\r\ndistricts a comparison of town with town as to the prevalence of\r\ninfection will enable one easily to learn where slop water is thrown\r\nfrom the back stoop, whether the well, the barn, and the privy are near\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE BABY, NOT THE LAW, IS THE TEST OF INFANT\r\n    PROTECTION IN COUNTRY AND IN CITY]\r\n\r\nTesting health rights requires not only that there be a board of health\r\nkeeping track of and publishing every case of infection, but it\r\nrequires further that one community be compared with other communities\r\nof similar size, and that each community be compared with itself year\r\nfor year. These comparisons have not been made and records do not exist\r\nin many states.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] A striking demonstration of law enforcement that followed lawmaking\r\nis given in _The Real Triumph of Japan_, L.L. Seaman, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE BEST INDEX TO COMMUNITY HEALTH IS THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL\r\nCHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory education laws, the gregarious instinct of children, the\r\nambition of parents, their self-interest, and the activities of\r\nchild-labor committees combine to-day to insure that one or more\r\nrepresentatives of practically every family in the United States will\r\nbe in public, parochial, or private schools for some part of the year.\r\nThe purpose of having these families represented in school is not only\r\nto give the children themselves the education which is regarded as a\r\nfundamental right of the American child, but to protect the community\r\nagainst the social and industrial evils and the dangers that result\r\nfrom ignorance. Great sacrifices are made by state, individual\r\ntaxpayer, and individual parent in order that children and state may be\r\nbenefited by education. Almost no resistance is found to any demand\r\nmade upon parent or taxpayer, if it can be shown that compliance will\r\nremove obstructions to school progress. If, therefore, by any chance,\r\nwe can find at school a test of home conditions affecting both the\r\nchild's health and his progress at school, it will be easy, in the name\r\nof the school, to correct those conditions, just as it will be easy to\r\nread the index, because the child is under state control for six hours\r\na day for the greater part of the years from six to fourteen.[4]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Facsimile) PHYSICAL RECORD.]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this test of home conditions prejudicial to health that\r\nwill register the fact as a thermometer tells us the temperature, or as\r\na barometer shows moisture and air pressure? The house address alone is\r\nnot enough, for many children surrounded by wealth are denied health\r\nrights, such as the right to play, to breathe pure air, to eat\r\nwholesome food, to live sanely. Scholarship will not help, because the\r\nfrailest child is often the most proficient. Manners mislead, for, like\r\ndress, they are but externals, the product of emulation, of other\r\npeople's influence upon us rather than of our living conditions.\r\nNationality is an index to nothing significant in America, where all\r\nrace and nationality differences melt into Americanisms, all responding\r\nin about the same way to American opportunity. No, our test must be\r\nsomething that cannot be put on and off, cannot be left at home, cannot\r\nbe concealed or pretended, something inseparable from the child and\r\nbeyond his control. This test it has been conclusively proved in\r\nChicago, Boston, Brookline, Philadelphia, and particularly in New York\r\nCity, is the physical condition of the school child. To learn this\r\ncondition the child must be examined and reexamined for the physical\r\nsigns called for by the card on page 34. Weight, height, and\r\nmeasurements are needed to tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nWhen this card is filled out for every child in a class or school or\r\ncity, the story told points directly to physical, mental, or health\r\nrights neglected. If for every child there is begun a special card,\r\nthat will tell his story over and over again during his school life,\r\nnoting every time he is sick and every time he is examined, the\r\nprogress of the community as well as of the child will be clearly\r\nshown. Such a history card (p. 314) is now in use in certain New York\r\nschools, as well as in several private schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched such an examination? By copying this card your\r\nfamily physician can give you a demonstration in a very short time as\r\nto the method and advantage of examination at school. The school\r\nphysician goes at nine o'clock to the doctor's room in the public\r\nschool, or, if there is no doctor's room, to that portion of the hall\r\nor principal's office where the doctor does his work. The teacher or\r\nthe nurse stands near to write the physician's decision. The doctor\r\nlooks the child over, glances at his eyes, his color, the fullness of\r\nhis cheeks, the soundness of his flesh, etc. If the physician says \"B,\"\r\nthe principal or nurse marks out the other letter opposite to number 1,\r\nso that the card shows that there is bad nutrition.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the teeth and throat a little wooden stick is used to\r\npush down the tongue. There should be a stick for every child, so that\r\ninfection cannot possibly be carried from one to the other. If this is\r\nimpossible, the stick should be dipped in an antiseptic such as boric\r\nacid or listerine. If, because of swollen tonsils, there is but a\r\nlittle slit open in the throat, or if teeth are decayed, the mark is Y\r\nor B. The whole examination takes only a couple of minutes, but the\r\nphysician often finds out in this short time facts that will save a boy\r\nand his parents a great deal of trouble. Very often this examination\r\ntells a story that overworked mothers have studiously concealed by\r\nbright ribbons and clean clothes. I remember one little girl of\r\nfourteen who looked very prosperous, but the physician found her so\r\nthin that he was sure that for some time she had eaten too little, and\r\ncalled her anaemic. He later found that the mother had seven children\r\nwhom she was trying to clothe and shelter and feed with only ten\r\ndollars a week. A way was found to increase her earnings and to give\r\nall the children better living conditions,--all because of the short\r\nstory told by the examination card. In another instance the card's\r\nstory led to the discovery of recent immigrant parents earning enough,\r\nbut, because unacquainted with American ways and with their new home,\r\nunable to give their children proper care.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING FOR ENLARGED TONSILS AND BAD TEETH\r\n    Note the mouth breather waiting]\r\n\r\nThe most extensive inquiry yet made in the United States as to the\r\nphysical condition of school children is that conducted by the board of\r\nhealth in New York City since 1905. From March, 1905, to January 1,\r\n1908, 275,641 children have been examined, and 198,139 or 71.9 per cent\r\nhave been found to have defects, as shown in Table VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN--PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\nHEALTH IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, 1905-1907\r\n\r\n=============================================+==========+===========\r\n                                             | Total    | Percentage\r\n---------------------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\nNumber of children examined                  | 275,641  |    100\r\nNumber of children needing treatment         | 198,139  |   71.9\r\n_Defects found:_                             |          |\r\n  Malnutrition                               |  16,021  |    5.8\r\n  Diseased anterior or posterior cervical    |          |\r\n    glands                                   | 125,555  |   45.5\r\n  Chorea                                     |   3,776  |    1.3\r\n  Cardiac disease                            |   3,385  |    1.2\r\n  Pulmonary disease                          |   2,841  |    1.0\r\n  Skin disease                               |   4,557  |    1.6\r\n  Deformity of spine, chest, or extremities  |   4,892  |    1.7\r\n  Defective vision                           |  58,494  |   21.2\r\n  Defective hearing                          |   3,540  |    1.2\r\n  Obstructed nasal breathing                 |  43,613  |   15.8\r\n  Defective teeth                            | 136,146  |   49.0\r\n  Deformed palate                            |   3,625  |    1.3\r\n  Hypertrophied tonsils                      |  75,431  |   27.4\r\n  Posterior nasal growths                    |  46,631  |   16.9\r\n  Defective mentality                        |   7,090  |    2.5\r\n=============================================+==========+=========\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that New York children must have more defects\r\nthan children elsewhere. If this assumption is wrong, if children in\r\nother parts of the United States are as apt to have eye defects,\r\nenlarged tonsils, and bad teeth as the children of the great\r\nmetropolis, then the army of children needing attention would be seven\r\nout of ten, or over 14,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhether these figures overstate or understate the truth, the school\r\nauthorities of the country should find out. The chances are that the\r\nschool in which you are particularly interested is no exception. To\r\nlearn what the probable number needing attention is, divide your total\r\nby ten and multiply the result by seven.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of every trouble and its particular relation to school\r\nprogress and to the general public health will be explained in\r\nsucceeding chapters. The point to be made here is that the examination\r\nof the school child discloses in advance of epidemics and breakdowns\r\nthe children whose physical condition makes them most likely to \"come\r\ndown\" with \"catching diseases,\" least able to withstand an attack, less\r\nfitted to profit fully from educational and industrial opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe only index to community conditions prejudicial to health that will\r\nmake known the child of the well-to-do who needs attention is the\r\nrecord of physical examination. No other means to-day exists by which\r\nthe state can, in a recognized and acceptable way, discover the failure\r\nof these well-to-do parents to protect their children's health and take\r\nsteps to teach and, if necessary, to compel the parents to substitute\r\nliving conditions that benefit for conditions that injure the child.\r\n\r\nAmong the important health rights that deserve more emphasis is the\r\nright to be healthy though not \"poor.\" A child's lungs may be weak,\r\nbreathing capacity one third below normal, weight and nutrition\r\ndeficient, and yet that child cannot contract tuberculosis unless\r\ndirectly exposed to the germs of that disease. But such a child can\r\ncontract chronic hunger, can in a hundred ways pay the penalty for\r\nbeing pampered or otherwise neglected. Physical examination is needed\r\nto find every child that has too little vitality, no zest for play,\r\nlittle resistance, even though sent to a private school and kept away\r\nfrom dirt and contagion.\r\n\r\nThe New York Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children\r\nvisited fourteen hundred homes of children found to have one or more of\r\nthe physical defects shown on the above card. While they found that low\r\nincomes have more than their proper share of defects and of unsanitary\r\nliving conditions, yet they saw emphatically also that low incomes do\r\nnot monopolize physical defects and unsanitary living conditions. Many\r\nfamilies having $20, $30, $40 a week gave their children neither\r\nmedical nor dental care. The share each income had in unfavorable\r\nconditions is shown by the summary in the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VII\r\n\r\nSHOWING PER CENT SHARE OF PHYSICAL DEFECTS OF CHILDREN, UNFAVORABLE\r\nHOUSING CONDITIONS, AND CHILD MORTALITY FOUND AMONG EACH FAMILY-INCOME\r\nGROUP\r\n\r\n========================+=============================================\r\n                        |         WEEKLY FAMILY INCOME\r\n                        +-----+------+------+------+------+------+----\r\n                        |     |      |      |      |      | $30  |\r\n                        |$0-10|$10-15|$16-19|$20-25|$25-29| and  |$100\r\n                        |     |      |      |      |      | over |\r\n                        +-----+------+------+------+------+------+----\r\n                        | %   |  %   |  %   |  %   |  %   |  %   |  %\r\n------------------------+-----+------+------+------+------+------+----\r\nProportion to total     |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  families              | 8.4 | 32.7 | 15.2 | 23.8 |  3.9 | 15.6 | 100\r\n                        |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n_Physical defects_:     |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Malnutrition          |13.8 | 43.4 | 12.4 | 17.9 |  3.4 |  9.  |  \"\r\n  Enlarged glands       | 8.6 | 37.4 | 14.6 | 22.6 |  3.6 | 13.2 |  \"\r\n  Defective breathing   | 9.6 | 32.3 | 15.5 | 24.4 |  2.8 | 15.4 |  \"\r\n  Bad teeth             | 8.1 | 32.2 | 15.3 | 24.5 |  4.8 | 15.1 |  \"\r\n  Defective vision      | 8.2 | 34.6 | 16.5 | 22.1 |  1.4 | 17.3 |  \"\r\n                        |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n_Unfavorable housing    |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  conditions_:          |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Dark rooms            | 8.2 | 35.4 | 18.1 | 18.4 |  3.8 | 15.9 |  \"\r\n  Closed air shaft      | 6.9 | 30.2 | 18.9 | 26.4 |  3.2 | 19.6 |  \"\r\n  No baths              |10.1 | 38.5 | 16.5 | 19.7 |  4.4 | 10.8 |  \"\r\n  Paying over 25% rent  | 8.6 | 27.6 | 21.7 | 14.7 |  ... | 27.6 |  \"\r\n                        |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n_Child Mortality_:      |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Families losing       |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   children             |10.3 | 35.5 | 14.7 | 20.5 |  5.4 | 13.6 |  \"\r\n  Families losing no    |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   children             | 6.4 | 30.1 | 15.7 | 26.9 |  2.4 | 18.6 |  \"\r\n  Children dead         |11.7 | 36.2 | 13.1 | 20.8 |  6.1 | 12.1 |  \"\r\n  Infants dying from    |     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   intestinal diseases  | 8.9 | 37.6 | 18.3 | 18.8 |  4.  | 12.4 |  \"\r\n  Children working      | 4.2 | 19.5 | 13.2 | 30.3 | 11.5 | 21.3 |  \"\r\n========================+=============================================\r\n\r\nThe index should be read in all grades from kindergarten to high school\r\nand college.\r\n\r\nLast winter the chairman of the Committee on the Physical Welfare of\r\nSchool Children was invited to speak of physical examination before an\r\nassociation of high-school principals. He began by saying, \"This\r\nquestion does not concern you as directly as it does the grammar-school\r\nprincipals, but you can help secure funds to help their pupils.\" One\r\nafter another the high-school principals present told--one of his own\r\ndaughter, another of his honor girls, a third of his honor boys--the\r\nsame story of neglected headaches due to eye strain, breakdowns due to\r\nundiscovered underfeeding, underexercise, or overwork. Are we coming to\r\nthe time when the state will step in to prevent any boy or girl in high\r\nschool, college, or professional school from earning academic honors at\r\nthe expense of health? Harmful conditions within schoolrooms and on\r\nschool grounds will not be neglected where pupils, teachers, school and\r\nfamily physicians, and parents set about to find and to remove the\r\ncauses of physical defects.\r\n\r\nDisease centers outside of school buildings quickly register themselves\r\nin the schoolroom and in the person of a child who is paying the\r\npenalty for living in contact with a disease center. If a child sleeps\r\nin a dark, ill-ventilated, crowded room, the result will show in his\r\neyes and complexion; if he has too little to eat or the wrong thing to\r\neat, he will be underweight and undersized; if his nutrition is\r\ninadequate and his food improper, he is apt to have eye trouble,\r\nadenoids, and enlarged tonsils. He may have defective lung capacity,\r\ndue to improper breathing, too little exercise in the fresh air, too\r\nlittle food. Existence of physical defects throws little light on\r\nincome at home, but conclusively shows lack of attention or of\r\nunderstanding. Several days' absence of a child from school leads, in\r\nevery well-regulated school, to a visit to the child's home or to a\r\nletter or card asking that the absence be explained. Even newly arrived\r\nimmigrants have learned the necessity and the advantage of writing the\r\nteacher an \"excuse\" when their children are absent. Furthermore,\r\nneighbors' children are apt to learn by friendly inquiry what the\r\nteacher may not have learned by official inquiry, why their playmate is\r\nno longer on the street or at the school desk. While physicians are\r\nsometimes willing to violate the law that compels notification of\r\ninfection, rarely would a physician fail to caution an infected family\r\nagainst an indiscriminate mingling with neighbors. Whether the family\r\nphysician is careless or not, the explanation of the absence which is\r\ndemanded by the school would give also announcement of any danger that\r\nmight exist in the home where the child is ill.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that in hundreds of thousands of cases the child labor\r\nlaw is violated and that therefore school examination is not an index\r\nto the poverty or neglect occasioning such child labor, it should be\r\nremembered that the best physical test is the child's presence at\r\nschool. The first step in thorough physical examination is a thorough\r\nschool census,--the counting of every child of school age. Moreover, a\r\nrelatively small number of children who violate the child labor law are\r\nthe only members of the family who ought to be in school. Younger\r\nchildren furnish the index and occasion the visit that should discover\r\nthe violation of law.\r\n\r\nAppreciation of health, as well as its neglect, is indexed by the\r\nphysical condition of school children. Habits of health are the other\r\nside of the shield of health rights unprotected. Physical examination\r\nwill discover what parents are trying to do as well as what they fail\r\nto do because of their ignorance, indifference, or poverty. In so far\r\nas parents are alive to the importance of health, the school\r\nexamination furnishes the occasion of enlisting them in crusades to\r\nprotect the public health and to enforce health rights. The Committee\r\non the Physical Welfare of School Children found many parents unwilling\r\nto answer questions as to their own living conditions until told that\r\nthe answers would make it easier to get better health environment not\r\nonly for their own children but for their neighbors' children.\r\nGenerally speaking, fathers and mothers can easily be interested in any\r\nkind of campaign in the name of health and in behalf of children. The\r\nadvantage of starting this health crusade from the most popular\r\nAmerican institution, the public school,--the advantage of instituting\r\ncorrective work through democratic machinery such as the public\r\nschool,--is incalculable. To any teacher, pastor, civic leader, health\r\nofficial, or taxpayer wanting to take the necessary steps for the\r\nremoval of conditions prejudicial to health and for the enforcement of\r\nhealth rights of child and adult, the best possible advice is to learn\r\nthe facts disclosed by the physical examination of your school\r\nchildren. See that those facts are used first for the benefit of the\r\nchildren themselves, secondly for the benefit of the community as a\r\nwhole. If your school has not yet introduced the thorough physical\r\nexamination of school children, take steps at once to secure such\r\nexamination. If necessary, volunteer to test the eyes and the breathing\r\nof one class, persuade one or two physicians to cooeperate until you\r\nhave proved to parent, taxpayer, health official, and teacher that such\r\nan examination is both a money-saving, energy-saving step and an act of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to emphasize over and over again the fact that\r\nit is the use of information and not the gathering of information that\r\nimproves the health. The United States Weather Bureau saves millions of\r\ndollars annually, not because flags are raised and bulletins issued\r\nforetelling the weather, but because shipowners, sailors, farmers, and\r\nfruit growers obey the warnings. Mere examination of school children\r\ndoes little good. The child does not breathe better or see better\r\nbecause the school physician fills out a card stating that there is\r\nsomething wrong with his eyes, nose, and tonsils. The examination tells\r\nwhere the need is, what children should have special attention, what\r\nparents need to be warned as to the condition of the child, what home\r\nconditions need to be corrected. If the facts are not used, that is an\r\nargument not against obtaining facts but against disregarding them.\r\n\r\nIn understanding medical examination we should keep clearly in mind the\r\ndistinction between medical school inspection, medical school\r\nexamination, and medical treatment at school. Medical inspection is the\r\nsearch for communicable disease. The results of medical inspection,\r\ntherefore, furnish an index to the presence of communicable diseases in\r\nthe community. Medical examination is the search for physical defects,\r\nsome of which furnish the soil for contagion. Its results are an index\r\nnot only to contagion but to conditions that favor contagion by\r\nproducing or aggravating physical defects and by reducing vitality.\r\nMedical treatment at school refers to steps taken under the school\r\nroof, or by school funds, to remove the defects or check the infection\r\nbrought to light by medical inspection and medical examination.\r\nTreatment is not an index. In separate chapters are given the reasons\r\nfor and against trying to treat at school symptoms of causes that exist\r\noutside of school. When, how often, and by whom inspection and\r\nexamination should be made is also discussed later. The one point of\r\nthis chapter is this: if we really want to know where in our community\r\nhealth rights are endangered, the shortest cut to the largest number of\r\ndangers is the physical examination of children at school,--private,\r\nparochial, reformatory, public, high, college.\r\n\r\nApart from the advantage to the community of locating its health\r\nproblems, physical examination is due every child. No matter where his\r\nschooling or at whose expense, every child has the right to advance as\r\nfast as his own powers will permit without hindrance from his own or\r\nhis playmates' removable defects. He has the right to learn that\r\nsimplified breathing is more necessary than simplified spelling, that\r\nnose plus adenoids makes backwardness, that a decayed tooth multiplied\r\nby ten gives malnutrition, and that hypertrophied tonsils are even more\r\nmenacing than hypertrophied playfulness. He has the right to learn that\r\nhis own mother in his own home, with the aid of his own family\r\nphysician, can remove his physical defects so that it will be\r\nunnecessary for outsiders to give him a palliative free lunch at\r\nschool, thus neglecting the cause of his defects and those of\r\nfellow-pupils.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Sir John E. Gorst in _The Children of the Nation_ reads the index of\r\nthe health of school children in the United Kingdom; John Spargo, in\r\n_The Bitter Cry of the Children_, and Simon N. Patten in _The New Basis\r\nof Civilization_, suggest the necessity for reading the index in the\r\nUnited States and for heeding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. READING THE INDEX TO HEALTH RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMOUTH BREATHING\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the physical condition of school children is our best index to\r\ncommunity health, who is to read the index? Unless the story is told in\r\na language that does not require a secret code or cipher, unless some\r\none besides the physician can read it, we shall be a very long time\r\nlearning the health needs of even our largest cities, and until\r\ndoomsday learning the health needs of small towns and rural districts.\r\nFortunately the more important signs can be easily read by the average\r\nparent or teacher. Fortunately, too, it is easy to persuade mothers and\r\nteachers that they can lighten their own labors, add to their\r\nefficiency, and help their children by being on the watch for mouth\r\nbreathing, for strained, crossed, or inflamed eyes, for decaying teeth,\r\nfor nervousness and sluggishness. Years ago, when I taught school in a\r\nMinnesota village, I had never heard of adenoids, hypertrophied\r\ntonsils, myopia, hypermetropia, or the relation of these defects and of\r\nneglected teeth to malnutrition, truancy, sickness, and dullness. I now\r\nsee how I could have saved myself several failures, the taxpayers a\r\ngreat deal of money, the parents a great deal of disappointment, and\r\nmany children a life of inefficiency, had I known what it is easy for\r\nall teachers and parents to learn to-day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUTH BREATHERS BEFORE \"ADENOID PARTY\"]\r\n\r\nThe features in the following cut are familiar to teachers the world\r\nover. Parents may reconcile themselves to such lips, eyes, and mouths,\r\nbut seldom do even neglectful parents fail to notice \"mouth breathing.\"\r\nChildren afflicted by such features suffer torment from playfellows\r\nwhose scornful epithets are echoed by the looking-glass. No fashion\r\nplate ever portrays such faces. No athlete, thinker, or hero looks out\r\nfrom printed page with such clouded, listless eyes. The more wonder,\r\ntherefore, that the meaning of these outward signs has not been\r\nappreciated and their causes removed; conclusive reason, also, for not\r\nbeing misled by recent talk of mouth breathing, adenoids, and enlarged\r\ntonsils, into the belief that the race is physically deteriorating.\r\nThree generations ago Charles Dickens in his _Uncommercial Traveller_\r\npointed out a relation between open mouths and backwardness and\r\ndelinquency that would have saved millions of dollars and millions of\r\nlife failures had the civilized world listened. He was speaking of\r\ndelinquent girls from seventeen to twenty years old in Wapping\r\nWorkhouse: \"I have never yet ascertained why a refractory habit should\r\naffect the tonsils and the uvula; but I have always observed that\r\nrefractories of both sexes and every grade, between a Ragged School and\r\nthe Old Bailey, have one voice, in which the tonsils and uvula gain a\r\ndiseased ascendency.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day we are just beginning to see over again the connection between\r\ninability to breathe through the nose and inability to see clearly\r\nright from wrong and inability to want to do what teachers and parents\r\nwish. Physical examinations show now, and might just as well have shown\r\nfifty years ago, that the great majority of truants and juvenile\r\noffenders have adenoids and enlarged tonsils. A recent examination made\r\nby the New York board of health on 150 children in one school made up\r\nfrom the truant school, the juvenile court, and Randall's Island,\r\nshowed that only three were without some physical defect and that 137\r\nhad adenoids and large tonsils. Dickens wrote his observations in 1860;\r\nin 1854 the New York Juvenile Asylum was started, and up to 1908 cared\r\nfor 40,000 children; in 1860 William Meyer pointed out, so that no one\r\nneed misunderstand, the harmful effects of adenoids. What would have\r\nbeen the story of juvenile waywardness, of sickness, of educational\r\nadvancement, had examinations for defective breathing been started in\r\n1853 or 1860 instead of 1905; if one per cent of the attention that has\r\nbeen given to teaching mouth breathers the ten commandments had been\r\nspent on removing the nasal obstructions to intelligence?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A \"DEGENERATE\" MADE NORMAL BY REMOVAL OF\r\n    ADENOIDS]\r\n\r\nWilliam Hegel, who is pictured on page 48, before his tonsils and\r\nadenoids were removed was described by his father in this way: \"When\r\nplaying with other boys on the street he seems dazed, and sluggish to\r\ngrasp the various situations occurring in the course of the game. When\r\nhe decides to do something he runs in a heedless, senseless way, as if\r\nrunning away,--will bump against something, pedestrian or building,\r\nbefore he comes to himself; seems dazed all the time. When told\r\nsomething by his mother he giggles in the most exasperating way, for\r\nwhich he receives a whipping quite often.\" The father said the whipping\r\nwas of no avail. The child was restless, talkative, and snored during\r\nsleep. He had an insatiable appetite. He was removed or transferred\r\nfrom five different schools in New York City. To get redress the father\r\ntook him to the board of education, whence he was referred to the\r\nassistant chief medical inspector of the department of health, whose\r\nexamination revealed immensely large fungous-looking tonsils and\r\nexcessive pharyngeal granulations (adenoids). He was operated on at a\r\nclinic. The tonsils and adenoids removed are pictured on the opposite\r\npage, reduced one third. After the operation the child was visited by\r\nthe assistant medical inspector. There was a marked improvement in his\r\nfacial expression,--he looked intelligent, was alert and interested.\r\nWhen asked how he felt, he answered, \"I feel fine now.\" It required\r\nabout fifteen minutes to get his history, during all of which time he\r\nwas responsive and interested, constantly correcting statements of his\r\nfather and volunteering other information. Eleven days after the\r\noperation he was reported to have had no more epileptic seizures.\r\n\"Doesn't talk in sleep. Doesn't snore. Doesn't toss about the bed. Has\r\nmore self-control. Tries to read the paper. His immoderate appetite is\r\nnot present.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REASON ENOUGH FOR MOUTH BREATHING\r\n    Adenoid and tonsils reduced one third]\r\n\r\nWhile the open mouth is a sure sign of defects of breathing, it is not\r\ntrue that the closed mouth, when awake and with other people, is proof\r\nthat there are no such defects. Children breathe through the mouth not\r\nbecause they like to, not because they have drifted into bad habits,\r\nnot because their parents did, not because the human race is\r\ndeteriorating, but because their noses are stopped up,--because they\r\nmust. A mouth breather is not only always taking unfiltered dirt germs\r\ninto his system but is always in the condition of a person who has\r\nslept in a stuffy room. What extra effort adenoids mean can be\r\nascertained by closing the nostrils for a forenoon.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons it is perhaps unfortunate that we can breathe at all\r\nwhen the nose is stopped up. If we could see with our ears as well as\r\nwith our eyes, we should probably not take as good care of our eyes. In\r\nthis respect the whole race has experienced the misfortune of the man\r\nof whom the coroner reported, \"Killed by falling too short a distance.\"\r\nBecause we can breathe through the mouth we have neglected for\r\ncenturies the nasal passages. When a cold stops the nose we necessarily\r\nbreathe through the mouth. Unfortunately children make the necessary\r\neffort required to breathe through the nose long before other people\r\nnotice the lines along the nose and the slow mind. Mouth breathing will\r\nshow with the child asleep, before the child awake loses power to\r\naccommodate his effort to the task. Therefore the importance of a\r\nphysical test at school to detect the beginnings of adenoids and large\r\ntonsils before these symptoms become obvious to others.\r\n\r\nNo child should be exempted from this examination because of apocryphal\r\ntheories that only the poor, the slum child, the refractory, or the\r\nunclean have defects in breathing. This very afternoon a friend has\r\ntold me of her year abroad with a girl of nine, whose parents are very\r\nwealthy. The girl is anaemic. Her backwardness humiliates her parents,\r\nespecially because she gave great promise until two years ago.\r\nHigh-priced physicians have prescribed for her. It happens that they\r\nare too eminent to give attention to such simple troubles as adenoids\r\nthat can be felt and seen. They are looking for complications of the\r\nliver or inflammation of muscles at the base of the brain. One\r\ncelebrated French savant found the adenoids, assured the mother that\r\nthe child would outgrow them, and advised merely that she be compelled\r\nto breathe through the nose. The mother and nursemaids nag the child\r\nall day. The poor unwise mother sits up nights to hold the child's jaws\r\ntight in the hope that air coming through the nose will absorb the\r\nadenoids. The mother is made nervous. Of course this makes the child\r\nmore nervous and adds to the evil effects of adenoids. If the mother\r\nhad the good fortune to be very poor, she could not sit up nights, and\r\nwould long ago have decided either to let the child alone or else to\r\nhave the trouble removed.\r\n\r\nAdenoids are not a city specialty. Country earache is largely due to\r\nadenoids or to inflammation that quickly leads to adenoids. In 415\r\nvillages of New York state twelve per cent were found to be mouth\r\nbreathers. For two summers I have known a lad named Fred. He lives at\r\nthe seashore. Throughout his twelve years he has lived in a veritable\r\nEl Dorado of health and nature beauty. Groves and dunes and flora vie\r\nwith the blues of ocean and sky in resting the eye and in filling the\r\nsoul with that harmony which is said to make for sound living. Yet to a\r\nchild, Fred's schoolmates are experts on patent medicines and on the\r\nheredity that is alleged to be responsible for bad temper, running\r\nsores, tuberculosis, anaemia, and weak eyes. Freddie is particularly\r\nfavored. His well-to-do parents have supplied him with ponies, games,\r\nand bicycles. Nothing prevents his breathing salt air fresh from the\r\nnorth pole but hermetically sealed windows. The father thinks it absurd\r\nto make a fuss over adenoids. Didn't he have them when a boy, and\r\ndoesn't he weigh two hundred pounds and \"make good money\"? The mother\r\nnever knew of operations for such trifles when she taught school; she\r\nsupposes her boy needs an operation, but \"just can't bear to see the\r\ndear child hurt.\" As for Fred, he breathes through his mouth, talks\r\nthrough his nose, grows indifferent to boy's fun, fails to earn\r\npromotion at school, and fears that \"I won't be strong in spite of all\r\nthe patent medicine I've taken.\" Father, mother, and Fred feel profound\r\npity for the city child living so far from nature.\r\n\r\nAdenoids are not monopolized by children whose parents are ignorant of\r\nthe importance of them and of physical examination. Last summer I was\r\nasked by a small boy to buy some chocolate. A glance at his cigar box\r\nwith its two or three uninviting things for sale showed that the boy\r\nwas really begging. He had thick lips, open mouth, \"misty\" eyes, and a\r\nnasal twang. I asked him if his teacher had not told him he had lumps\r\nback of his nose and could not breathe right. He said, \"No.\" I\r\nexplained then that he could make a great deal more money if he talked\r\nlike other boys, stepped livelier, and breathed as other people\r\nbreathe. He said he had \"been by a doctor onct but didn't want to be\r\nop'rated.\" I turned to my companion and asked, \"Have you never noted\r\nthose same lines on your boy's face?\" Although he had been lecturing on\r\nmouth breathers, he had never noticed his own boy's trouble. He\r\nhastened home and found the infallible signs. The mother declared it\r\ncould not be true of her boy. About five months before, their family\r\nphysician had said of the child's earache, \"The same inflammation of\r\nthe nasal passages that causes earache causes adenoids; you must be on\r\nthe lookout.\" Although in the country, the boy's appetite was not good\r\nand his zest for play had flagged. They had looked for the trouble to\r\nback generations and in psychology books,--everywhere but at the boy's\r\nface, in his mouth, and in his nose. After the operation, which took\r\nless than two minutes, the appetite was ravenous, the eyes cleared,\r\nand the spirit rebounded to its old buoyancy that craved worlds to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nThe new personal experience made a deep impression upon my friend's\r\nmind. He wanted everybody to know how easy it was to overlook a child's\r\ndistress. One person after another had a story to tell him; even the\r\njanitor said: \"You'd ought to have seen our John at sixteen. He spent a\r\nweek by the hospital.\" The only people who do not seem to know more\r\nthan the new convert are the mouth breathers whom he religiously stops\r\non the street.\r\n\r\nThe indexes to adenoids and large tonsils for the teacher to read at\r\nschool are:\r\n\r\n  1. Inability to breathe through the nose.\r\n\r\n  2. A chronically running nose, accompanied by frequent nose-bleeds\r\n  and a cough to clear the throat.\r\n\r\n  3. Stuffy speech and delayed learning to talk. \"Common\" is\r\n  pronounced \"cobbed\"; \"nose,\" \"dose\"; and \"song,\" \"sogg.\"\r\n\r\n  4. A narrow upper jaw and irregular crowding of the teeth.\r\n\r\n  5. Deafness.\r\n\r\n  6. Chorea or nervousness.\r\n\r\n  7. Inflamed eyes and conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nThe adenoids and large tonsils discovered at school are an index:\r\n\r\n  1. To children needlessly handicapped in school work.\r\n\r\n  2. To teachers needlessly burdened.\r\n\r\n  3. To whole classes held back by afflicted children.\r\n\r\n  4. To breeding grounds for disease.\r\n\r\n  5. To homes where children's diseases and tuberculosis are most\r\n  likely to break out and flourish.\r\n\r\n  6. To parents who need instruction in their duty to their\r\n  children, to themselves, and to their neighbors, and who are\r\n  ignorant of the way in which \"catching\" diseases originate and\r\n  spread.\r\n\r\nThe riot that occurred when the adenoids of children in a school on the\r\n\"East Side\" in New York City were removed without the preliminary of\r\nconvincing the parents as to the advantages of the operation was merely\r\na demand for the \"right to knowledge,\" which is never overlooked with\r\nimpunity. Reluctance to permit operation on a young child, and the\r\nnatural shrinking of a parent at seeing a child under the surgeon's\r\nknife, require the teacher or school physician or nurse to answer fully\r\nthe usual questions of the hesitant mother and father.\r\n\r\n1. Is the operation necessary? Will the child not outgrow its adenoids?\r\nUsually the adenoid growths atrophy or dry up after the age of puberty.\r\nAdenoids are not uncommon in adults, however. The surgeon general of\r\nthe army reports that during the year 1905, out of 3004 operations on\r\nofficers and enlisted men in service, there were 225 operations on the\r\nnose, mouth, and pharynx, 103 of which were operations for adenoids and\r\nenlarged or hypertrophied tonsils. Allowing the child to \"outgrow\"\r\nadenoids may mean not only that he is being subjected to infection\r\nchronically but that his body is allowed to be permanently deformed and\r\nhis health endangered. Beginning at the age of the second dentition,\r\nthe bones of jaw, nose, throat, and chest are undergoing important\r\nchanges--nasal occlusion. Adenoids left to atrophy--if large enough to\r\ncause mouth breathing--may mean atrophy of this developing process,\r\npermanent disfiguration of face, and permanent deformity of chest and\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\n2. Will the growth recur? In a few cases it does recur; frequently\r\neither because it was not desirable to make a complete removal of the\r\nadenoid tissue or because the surgeon was careless. If the growths do\r\nrecur, then they must be removed again.\r\n\r\n3. Is the operation a dangerous one?\r\n\r\n4. Is an anaesthetic necessary?\r\n\r\n5. Will the operation cure the child of all its troubles? These\r\nquestions are best answered by the process and results of an \"adenoid\r\nparty,\" which was given especially for the benefit of this book, every\r\nstep and symptom of which were carefully studied.\r\n\r\nThe seven children pictured here were discovered by their school\r\nphysician to have moderately large adenoid growths,--one boy having\r\nenlarged tonsils also.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUTH BREATHERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER \"ADENOID\r\n    PARTY\"]\r\n\r\nThe picture on page 46 was taken by flash light at 2.30 P.M., January\r\n15, 1908. At 3 P.M. the principal escorted these children into the\r\noperating room at Vanderbilt Clinic. The doctor examined the throat and\r\nnose of each child, entered the name and age of each, together with his\r\ndiagnosis, on a clinic card, sending each child into the next room\r\nafter examination. He then called the first boy and explained that it\r\nwould hurt, but that it would be over in a minute. The principal stood\r\nby and told him to be brave and remember the five cents he could have\r\nfor ice cream afterwards. The clinic nurse tied a large towel about him\r\nand put him in her lap; with one hand she held his clasped hands, while\r\nthe other held his head back. The doctor then took the little\r\ninstrument--the curette--and pushed it up back of the soft palate, and\r\nwith one twist brought out the offending spongy lump. The boy's head\r\nwas immediately held over a basin of running water. He was so occupied\r\nwith spitting out the blood that rushed down to choke him that he\r\nhadn't time to cry before the acute pain had ceased. The rush of cool\r\nair through his nostrils was such a pleasurable sensation that he\r\nsmiled as the school nurse escorted him out into the hall to wait for\r\nhis companions. At 3.30 P.M. all seven children were out in the hall,\r\nall seven mouths were closed, and all seven faces were clothed with the\r\nsleepy, peaceful expression that comes with rest from the prolonged\r\nlabor of trying to get enough air. At 3.45 P.M. they had been all\r\nreexamined by the doctor, and a few tag ends were picked out of the\r\nnasopharynx of one child. At 4 P.M. the \"party\" had returned to the\r\nChildren's Aid Society's school and to the ice cream that follows each\r\nadenoid party.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to tell mothers stories of the \"marvelous improvement\r\nin school progress of those children whose brains have been poisoned\r\nand starved by the accursed adenoid growths, and how their bodies\r\nfairly bloom when the mysterious and awful incubus is removed,\" to use\r\nthe words of one school principal. It is worth while to show them\r\n\"before\" and \"after\" pictures, and \"before\" and \"after\" children, and\r\n\"before\" and \"after\" school marks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCATCHING DISEASES, COLDS, DISEASED GLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadly fevers, the plague, black death, cholera, malaria, smallpox,\r\ntaught mankind invaluable lessons. Millions of human beings died before\r\nthe mind of man devoted itself to preventing the diseases for which no\r\nsure cure had been found. Efforts to conquer these diseases were tardy\r\nbecause men were taught that some unseen power was punishing men and\r\ngovernments for their sins. The difference between the old and the new\r\nway is shown powerfully by a painting in the Liverpool Gallery entitled\r\n\"The Plague.\" A mediaeval village is strewn with the dead and dying.\r\nBloated, spotted faces look into the eyes of ghouls as laces and\r\njewelry are torn from bodies not yet cold. In the foreground a muscular\r\ngiant, paragon of conscious virtue, clad like John the Baptist and\r\nBible in hand, finds his way among his plague-stricken fellow-townsmen,\r\nurging them to turn from their sins. Modern efficiency learns of the\r\nfirst outbreak of the plague, isolates the patient, kills rats and\r\ntheir fleas which spread the disease, thoroughly cleanses or destroys,\r\nif necessary, all infected clothing, bedding, floors, and walls, and\r\nmakes it possible for us to go on living for each other with a better\r\nchance of \"bringing forth fruits worthy for repentance.\"\r\n\r\nWhere boards of health make it compulsory to report cases of sickness\r\ndue to contagion, health records are a reliable index to \"catching\"\r\ndiseases. But now that the chief infection is the kind that afflicts\r\nchildren, we can read the index before the outbreak that calls in a\r\nphysician to diagnose the case. School examination shows which\r\nchildren have defects that welcome and encourage disease germs. It\r\npoints to homes that cultivate germs, and consequently menace other\r\nhomes. To locate children who have enlarged tonsils may prevent a\r\ndiphtheria epidemic. To detect in September those who are\r\nundernourished, who have bad teeth, and who breathe through the mouth\r\nwill help forecast winter's outbreaks of scarlet fever and measles. One\r\ndollar spent at this season in examination for soil hospitable to\r\ndisease germs may save fifty dollars otherwise necessary for inspection\r\nand cure of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nIt is harder at first to interest a community in medical examination\r\nthan in medical inspection, because we are all afraid of \"catching\"\r\ndiseases, while few of us know how they originate and how they can be\r\nprevented by correcting the unfavorable conditions which physical\r\nexamination of school children will bring to light.\r\n\r\nCourses in germ sociology are therefore of prime necessity. How do\r\ngerms act? On what do they live? Why do they move from place to place?\r\nWhat causes them to become extinct? With few exceptions, germs migrate\r\nfor the same reason as man,--search for food, love of conquest, and\r\nlove of adventure. When there is plenty of food they multiply rapidly.\r\nFull of life, overflowing with vitality, they move out for new worlds\r\nto conquer. Like human beings, they will do their best to get away from\r\na country that provides a scanty food supply. Like men and women, they\r\nstarve if they cannot eat. Like boys and girls, they avoid enemies; the\r\nweak give way to the strong, the slow to the swift, the devitalized to\r\nthe vitalized.\r\n\r\nHuman sociology imprisons, puts to death, deprives of opportunity to do\r\nevil, or reforms those who murder, steal, or slander. Germ sociology\r\nteaches us to do the same with injurious germs. We imprison them, we\r\ntake away their food supply, we kill them outright, or we starve them\r\nslowly. They have a peculiar diet, being especially partial to\r\ndecomposing vegetable and animal matter and to what human beings call\r\ndirt. By putting this diet out of their reach we make it impossible for\r\nthem to propagate their kind. By placing poison within their reach or\r\nby forcing it upon them we can successfully eliminate them as enemies.\r\nAs the president of Mexico restored order \"by setting a thief to catch\r\na thief,\" so modern science is setting germs to kill germs that harm\r\ncrops and human stock. Of utmost consequence is it that the body's germ\r\nconsumer--its pretorian guard--be always armed with vitality ready to\r\nvanquish every intruding hostile germ. If we are false to our guard, it\r\nwill turn traitor and join invaders in attacking us. But here, as in\r\ndealing with evils that originate with human beings, an ounce of\r\nprevention is worth a ton of cure. The most effectual way to eliminate\r\ngerm diseases is to remove the cause--the food supply of disease germs.\r\nThe fact that many germs are plants, not animals, does not weaken the\r\nanalogy, for weeds do not get a chance in well-tilled soil.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable recent example of government germ\r\nextermination is the triumph over the yellow-fever and malaria mosquito\r\nin Panama. When the French started to build a canal in Panama, the\r\nfirst thing they did was to build a hospital. The hospital was always\r\nfull and the canal was given up. At the time the United States proposed\r\nto re-attempt the work, it was thought that it could not be done\r\nwithout great loss of life and without great labor difficulties.\r\nInstead of taking the sickness for granted and enlarging the French\r\nhospital, the chief medical inspector, Gorgas, took for granted that\r\nthere need be no unusual sickness if proper preventive measures were\r\ntaken. He knew what the French had not known, that the yellow-fever\r\nscourge depends for its terrors upon mosquitoes. Accordingly, with the\r\naid of six thousand men and five million dollars he set about to\r\nstarve out the few infected and infectious kinds of mosquito,--the\r\nyellow-fever or house mosquito and the malaria or meadow mosquito. He\r\nintroduced waterworks and hydrants, paved the streets, drained the\r\nswamps and pools in which they breed, and instituted a weekly\r\nhouse-to-house inspection to prevent even so much as a pail of stagnant\r\nwater offering harbor to these enemies. The grass of the meadows where\r\nthe malaria mosquito breeds was cut short and kept short within three\r\nhundred feet of dwellers,--as far as the mosquito can fly. All ditches\r\nwere disinfected with paraffin, and the natives were forced to observe\r\nsanitary laws. President Roosevelt, in his special message to Congress\r\non the Panama Canal in 1906, stated that in the weekly house-to-house\r\nvisit of the inspectors at the time he was in Panama but two mosquitoes\r\nwere found. These were not of the dangerous type. As a consequence of\r\nthis sanitary engineering there is very little sickness in Panama, the\r\nhospital is seldom one third full, and the canal is progressing very\r\nmuch faster than was expected. Panama, like Havana, is now safer than\r\nmany American cities, because cleaner and less hospitable to disease\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nAny place where numbers of people are accustomed to assemble favors the\r\npropagation of germs,--whether it be the meetinghouse, the townhall,\r\nthe theater, or the school. Every teacher can be the sanitary engineer\r\nof her own schoolroom, school, or community by cooeperating with the\r\nschool doctor, the town board of health, family physicians, and\r\nmothers. Every teacher can exterminate disease by applying the very\r\nsame principles to her schoolroom as Chief Medical Inspector Gorgas\r\napplied to Panama. Knowledge, disinfection, absolute cleanliness,\r\neducation, and inspection are the essential steps. First she must know\r\nthat \"children's diseases\" are not necessary. She should discountenance\r\nthe old superstition that every child must run the gamut of children's\r\ndiseases, that every child must sooner or later have whooping cough,\r\nmeasles, chicken pox, mumps, scarlet fever, just as they used to think\r\nyellow fever and cholera inevitable. The price of this terrible\r\nignorance has been not only expense, loss of time, acquisition of\r\npermanent physical defects, and loss of vitality, but, for the majority\r\nof children, death before reaching five years of age. All these\r\n\"catching\" diseases are germ diseases, which disinfection can\r\neliminate. The free use of strong yellow soap and disinfectants on the\r\nschool floor, windows, benches, desks, blackboards, pencils, in the\r\ncoat closets and toilets, plus the natural disinfectants, hot sun and\r\noxygen, will prevent the schoolroom from being a source of danger. One\r\nor more of these germ-killing remedies must be constantly applied;\r\ncleansing deserves a larger part in every school budget.\r\n\r\nOften country towns are as ignorant of the existence of germs and of\r\nthe means of preventing the spread of disease as the woman in a small\r\ncountry town who used daily to astound the neighbors by the \"shower of\r\nsnow\" she produced by shaking the bedding of her sick child out of the\r\nwindow. Their astonishment was soon changed to panic when that shower\r\nof snow resulted in a deadly epidemic of scarlet fever. Medical\r\ninspection of New York City's schools was begun after an epidemic of\r\nscarlet fever was traced to a popular boy who passed around among his\r\nschoolmates long rolls of skin from his fingers.\r\n\r\nMuch of the care exercised at school to prevent children's diseases is\r\ncounteracted because children are exposed at home and in public places\r\nto contagion, where ignorance more often than carelessness is the cause\r\nof uncleanliness. By hygiene lessons, illustrating practically the\r\nproper methods of cleaning a room, much may be done to enlist school\r\nchildren in the battle against germs. Through the enthusiasm of the\r\nchildren as well as through visits to the homes parents may be\r\ninstructed as to the danger of letting well children sleep with sick\r\nchildren; the wisdom of vaccination to prevent smallpox, of antitoxin\r\nto prevent serious diphtheria, of tuberculin tests to settle the\r\nquestion whether tuberculosis is present; why anything that gathers\r\ndust is dangerous unless cleansed and aired properly; and why bedding,\r\nfurniture, floor coverings, and curtains that can be cleansed and aired\r\nare more beautiful and more safe than carpets, feather beds,\r\nupholstery, and curtains that are spoiled by water and sunshine; how to\r\ncare for the tuberculous member of the family, etc. Anti-social acts\r\nmay be prevented, such as carrying an infected child to the doctor in a\r\npublic conveyance, thereby infecting numberless other people; sending\r\ninfected linen to a common laundry; mailing a letter written by an\r\ninfected person without first disinfecting it; sending a child with\r\ndiphtheria to the store; returning to the dairy unscalded milk bottles\r\nfrom a sick room.\r\n\r\nThe daily inspection of school children for contagious diseases by the\r\nschool physician has, where tried, been found to reduce considerably\r\nthe amount of sickness in a town. Such inspection should be universally\r\nadopted. Moreover, the teacher should be conversant with the early\r\nsymptoms of these diseases so that on the slightest suspicion the child\r\nmay be sent home without waiting for the physician's call. Like the\r\nlittle girl who never stuttered except when she talked, school children\r\nand school-teachers are rarely frightened until too late to prevent\r\ntrouble. The \"easy\" diseases such as measles, whooping cough, etc.,\r\ncost our communities more than the more terrible diseases like typhoid\r\nand smallpox. During one typical week ending May 18, 630 new cases of\r\nmeasles were reported to one department of health. Obviously the\r\nnineteen deaths reported give no conception of the suffering, the cost,\r\nthe anxiety caused by this preventable disease. The same may be said\r\nof diphtheria and croup, of which only thirty-two deaths are reported,\r\nbut 306 cases of sickness. Yet no one to-day will send a child to sleep\r\nwith a playmate so as to catch diphtheria and \"be done with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe most strategic point of attack is almost universally unrecognized.\r\nThat is the child's mouth. Here the germs find lodgment, here they find\r\na culture medium--at the gateway of the human system. The mouth is\r\nnever out of service and is almost never in a state of true\r\ncleanliness. Solid particles from the breath, saliva, food between the\r\nteeth, and other debris form a deposit on the teeth and decompose in a\r\nconstant temperature of ninety-eight degrees Fahrenheit. In the normal\r\nmouth from eight to twenty years of age the teeth present from twenty\r\nto thirty square inches of dentate surface, constantly exposed to\r\never-changing, often inimical, conditions. This bacterially infected\r\nsurface makes a fairly large garden plot. Every cavity adds to the\r\ngerm-nourishing soil. Dental caries--tooth decay--is a disease hitherto\r\nalmost universal from birth to death. Thus the air taken in through the\r\nmouth becomes a purveyor of its poisonous emanations and affects the\r\nlung tissues and the blood. Food and water carry hostile germs down\r\ninto the stomach. Thence they may be carried into any organ or tissue,\r\njust as nourishment or poison is carried.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the child with an unclean mouth not only infects and\r\nreinfects himself but scatters germs in the air whenever he sneezes or\r\ncoughs. In a cold apartment where there is no appreciable current of\r\nair a person can scatter germs for a distance of more than twenty-two\r\nfeet. Germs are also scattered through the air by means of salivary or\r\nmucous droplets. It is this fact that makes colds so dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII\r\n\r\n=City of Manchester Education Committee=\r\n\r\n=INFECTIOUS OR CONTAGIOUS DISEASES IN SCHOOLS INFORMATION FOR TEACHERS=\r\n\r\n  Four columns are omitted: (1) Interval between Exposure to\r\n  Infection and the First Signs of the Disease; (2) Day from Onset\r\n  of Illness on which Rash appears; (3) Period of Exclusion from\r\n  School after Exposure to Infection; (4) Period of Exclusion from\r\n  School of Person suffering from the Disease\r\n\r\n-----------+------------------------------+------------+------------------\r\nDISEASE    | PRINCIPAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS | Method of  | REMARKS\r\n           |                              | Infection  |\r\n-----------+------------------------------+------------+------------------\r\nMeasles    |_Begins like cold in the      |            |After effects\r\n           |head_, with _feverishness,    |            |often severe.\r\n           |running nose, inflamed and    |            |Period of greatest\r\n           |watery eyes, and sneezing_;   |            |risk of infection\r\n           |small crescentic groups of    | Breath and |first three or\r\n           |_mulberry-tinted spots_ appear| discharges |four days, before\r\n           |about the third day; _rash    | from nose  |the rash appears.\r\n           |first seen on forehead and    | and mouth. |May have repeated\r\n           |face_.

BROWN RITCHIE=, _Medical Officer to Education Committee_.\r\n\r\nMost people still think that colds are due to cold air or draughts\r\nrather than to a cold germ, which finds a body unequipped with\r\nresisting power, with its germ police off guard, exhausted from\r\noverwork, or disaffected and ready to turn traitor if the enemy seems\r\nstronger than our vitality. Sometimes it seems as if we contracted it\r\nfrom a sneezing fellow-passenger, sometimes from a draught from an open\r\ncar window. An uninformed opponent of the theory that colds are a germ\r\ndisease wrote the following letter last winter to a New York newspaper:\r\n\r\n  In addition to the Society for the Suppression of Noises there\r\n  should be in this town a Society for the Suppression of\r\n  \"Fresh-Air\" Fiends. The newspapers report an epidemic of\r\n  pneumonia, grippe, and colds. It is almost entirely due to the\r\n  fact that the average New Yorker is compelled to live, move, and\r\n  have his being from daylight to midnight in a succession of\r\n  draughts of cold air caused by the insanity of overfed male and\r\n  female hogs, who, with blood almost bursting through their skins,\r\n  demand \"fresh air\" in order to keep from suffocating. Everywhere a\r\n  man goes, day or night, he is in a draught caused by the crazy\r\n  ideas about fresh air.\r\n\r\n  Our wise ancestors, who as a rule lived much longer than we do,\r\n  and had much better health, said:\r\n\r\n    \"If the wind should blow through a hole,\r\n    God have mercy on your soul.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the correspondent has learned that our ancestors had more colds\r\nthan we, had poorer health, and died twenty years younger, perhaps he\r\nwill listen to proof that his unclean warm air weakens the body and\r\nmakes it an easy prey to cold germs.\r\n\r\nMany physicians preach and practice this fallacy as to fresh air and\r\ncolds, but few physicians now deny that influenza is a germ disease or\r\nthat a nose so irritated and so neglected as to secrete large\r\nquantities of mucus is a better place for breeding disease germs than a\r\nnose whose membranes are clean and not thus irritated.\r\n\r\nUntil medical specialists are agreed, and until they have definitely\r\nlocated the cold germ, we laymen must choose for ourselves a working\r\ntheory. The weight of opinion at the present time declares that colds\r\nare due to germs. Strong membranes with good circulation and drainage\r\nprovide poor food for germs. Congested membranes furnish proper\r\nconditions for propagation. The germ theory explains the spread of\r\ngerms from the nose to the passages of the head, and from head to\r\narteries and lungs.\r\n\r\nA cold can always be charged to some one else. How many can be laid to\r\nour account? There is one right that is universally not recognized, and\r\nthat is the right of protection from the germs showered in the air we\r\nbreathe, over the food we eat, by the sneezes of our unfortunate\r\nneighbor at school, in the street car, at the restaurant. The chief\r\ndanger of a cold is to our neighbor, not to ourselves. A cold which a\r\nstrong person may throw off in a day or two may mean death to his\r\ntuberculous neighbor. Though for our own health \"lying up for a mere\r\ncold\" is an unnecessary bore, the failure to do so may deprive our\r\nneighbor of a right greater than the right to protection against\r\nscarlet fever or smallpox. Though formerly this statement would not\r\nhave been true, rights change with conditions, and the fact that to-day\r\nthe three most deadly diseases are pneumonia, tuberculosis, and\r\ndiphtheria,--all diseases of the respiratory organs,--justifies the\r\nassertion that we have a right to protection against colds. The\r\nprevalence of colds, sore throats, irritated vocal cords, bad voices,\r\ncatarrh, bronchitis, laryngitis, and asthma in America to-day demands\r\nsummary measures. One can learn to sneeze into a handkerchief, not into\r\na companion's face or into a room. School children can be taught to\r\navoid handkerchiefs on which mucus has dried. In the far distant future\r\nwe may be willing to use cheesecloth, and boil it or throw it away, or,\r\nlike the Japanese, use soft paper handkerchiefs and burn them after\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IX\r\n\r\nDEATH RATE PER 10,000 POPULATION, PNEUMONIA AND BRONCHITIS FIVE-YEAR\r\nPERIOD, 1896-1900\r\n\r\n  England and Wales       22.70\r\n  Scotland                27.40\r\n  Stockholm               26.70\r\n  London                  31.20\r\n  Berlin                  16.10\r\n  Vienna                  39.70\r\n  Christiania             21.30\r\n  Boston                  30.60\r\n  Chicago                 24.20\r\n  Philadelphia            25.10\r\n  New York City           36.60\r\n\r\nOne child with a cold can infect a whole class or family, thus\r\ndepriving the class and family of the top of their vitality and\r\nefficiency without their consent. Because a person is thought a\r\nweakling who lies up for a \"mere cold,\" one is inclined to wish that\r\ncolds were as prostrating as typhoid, in which case there would be some\r\nhope of their extermination.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of children with colds from school deserves trial as a\r\ncheck to children's diseases. Many of these \"catching\" diseases start\r\nwith a cold in the head, as, for instance, measles, influenza, and\r\nwhooping cough. The first symptom of mumps, diphtheria, and scarlet\r\nfever is a sore throat or swollen glands, which, because they commonly\r\naccompany a cold, are not at first distinguished from it.\r\n\r\nThe first step for the teacher or mother in reading the index for colds\r\nis to look into the coat closet for evidence of warm clothing and\r\novershoes, then to note whether the children put them on when they go\r\nout for lunch or recess. Whether \"cold\" settles in the nasal passages,\r\near, or stomach depends upon which is the weak spot. Draughts, thin\r\nsoles, wet soles, exposure when perspiring, may be the immediate cause\r\nof the nutritional or respiratory disturbances that give cold germs a\r\nfoothold. Adenoids, diseased teeth, inflamed ears, may furnish the food\r\nsupply. \"There is no use treating children and sending them on\r\nfresh-air trips as long as they have nutritional and digestive\r\ndisturbances due to bad teeth, or colds due to adenoids,\" said a\r\nphysician when examining a party of children for a summer outing. The\r\ngreat preventive measure to be taken for catching diseases, colds,\r\ndiseased glands,--in fact all germ diseases,--is the repeated cleansing\r\nof those portions of the human body in which germs may find\r\nlodgment,--the mouth, the nose, the eyes, and the ears.\r\n\r\nIn caring for young infants great pains is taken to cleanse all the\r\norifices daily, but as soon as the child washes himself this practice\r\nis usually abandoned. Washing these gateways is far more important than\r\nwashing the surface of the body through which germs could not possibly\r\ngain entrance into the system except through wounds. Oftentimes the\r\ndouching of the nostrils with salt water will stop a cold at once. The\r\nmouth is the most important place of all, and the teacher should take\r\ncare of her pupils' mouths first and foremost. As bad teeth, enlarged\r\ntonsils, and adenoids harbor germs and putrescent matter that vitiate\r\nevery incoming and outgoing breath, these defects should be immediately\r\ncorrected. Are we coming to a time when a thorough house-cleaning in\r\nthe mouth of every child will take place before he enters the\r\nschoolroom, preferably in the presence of the teacher?\r\n\r\nTwo other \"catching\" diseases cause city schools a great deal of\r\ntrouble,--trachoma and pediculosis (head lice). There are probably no\r\ntwo diseases more quickly transmitted from one person to another.\r\nAlmost before their presence is known, all children of a school or all\r\npersons of a group have contracted them. When at college twenty men of\r\nmy fraternity discovered almost at the same time that they had an\r\ninfectious eye trouble; yet we thought we were using different towels\r\nand otherwise taking sanitary precautions. Last summer a Vassar\r\ngraduate took a party of tenement children for a country picnic. She\r\nreturned with head lice that required constant attention for weeks.\r\nWhat then may we expect of children who live in homes where there is\r\nneither water, time, nor privacy for bathing, where one towel must\r\nserve a family of six, where mothers work for wages away from home and\r\nsee their children only before seven and after six?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for thousands of children, many parents still believe\r\nthese troubles will be outgrown. Last summer a fresh-air agency in New\r\nYork City arranged for several hundred school girls to go to a certain\r\ncamp for ten days each. The only condition was that the heads should be\r\nfree from lice and nits (eggs). From the list furnished by\r\nschool-teachers--girls supposed to have been cured by school\r\nnurses--not one in five was accepted. A baby two weeks old, brought to\r\nCaroline Rest, had already begun to suffer from this easily preventable\r\nscourge. Of 1219 children examined in Edinburgh, Scotland, 909, or 69\r\nper cent, had some skin disease, and 60 per cent had sores due to head\r\nlice. Even when neglect has caused the loss of hair and ugly sores on\r\nthe head, mothers deceive themselves into believing that some other\r\ncause is responsible.\r\n\r\nTrachoma, if neglected, not only impairs the health of the eye, but may\r\ncause blindness. Tears carry the germs from the eye to the face, where\r\nthey are taken up on handkerchiefs, towels, and fingers and infect\r\nother eyes. Of late, thanks to school nurses and physicians and hygiene\r\ninstruction, American cities have found relatively little trachoma\r\nexcept among recent immigrants. So dangerous is the germ and so\r\ninsidious its methods of propagation, that a physician should be\r\nsummoned at once at the first sign of inflammation. Conjunctivitis is\r\ndue to a germ, and will spread unless checked. Since the board of\r\nhealth of New York City has instituted the systematic examination of\r\nthe eyes of the children in the public schools, it has found fully one\r\nthird affected with some form of conjunctivitis. Many of these cases\r\nare out-and-out trachoma, others acute conjunctivitis, and a larger\r\nproportion are \"mild trachoma.\" This last form of the disease is found\r\nto a great extent among children who have adenoids. The adenoids should\r\nbe regarded as a predisposing factor rather than a direct cause.\r\nTherefore sore eyes are given as one of the indexes of adenoids. When\r\nwe consider that adenoids are made up of lymphoid material, and that\r\ntrachoma follicles are made up of the same sort of tissue, it is not\r\nsurprising that the two conditions are found in the same child. The\r\ncatarrhal inflammation produced by adenoids in the nasal mucous\r\nmembrane travels up the lachrymal duct and thus infects the conjunctiva\r\nby contiguity.\r\n\r\nIn preventing pediculosis and infection of the eye vigilance and\r\ncleanliness are indispensable. After the diseases are advanced, after\r\nthe germ colonies have taken title, some antiseptic or germ killer more\r\nviolent than water is needed,--kerosene for the hair or strong green\r\noil soap; for the eye, only what a physician prescribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEYE STRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever school children's eyes have been examined, from six to nine\r\nout of thirty are found to be nearsighted, farsighted, or otherwise in\r\nneed of attention. A child is dismissed from school for obstinately\r\ndeclaring that the letter between _c_ and _t_ in \"cat\" is an _o_; \"a\r\npupil in her fourth school year was recently brought to me by her\r\nteacher with the statement that she did unreasonably poor work in\r\nreading for an intelligent and willing child;\" a boy is punished for\r\nbeing backward. These three cases are typical. Examinations showed that\r\nthe first child was astigmatic and not obstinate; the boy had run a pin\r\ninto one eye ten years before and destroyed its sight; while the second\r\ngirl was found to be afflicted with diplopia, and in a friendly chat\r\ntold the following story: \"I very often see two words where there is\r\nonly one. When I was a very little girl I used to write every word\r\ntwice. Then I was scolded for being careless. _So I learned that I must\r\nnot say two words even when I saw them._\" As Miss Alida S. Williams,\r\nprincipal of Public School 33 in New York City, has in many articles\r\nand addresses freely illustrated from school experience, the art of\r\nseeing is acquired, not congenital, and every human being who possesses\r\nit has learned it.\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of children suffering more or less seriously from\r\neye trouble has led many persons to suggest physical deterioration as\r\nthe cause. Eye specialists, however, assure us that eye troubles are\r\nprobably as old as man. Our tardiness in learning the facts regarding\r\nthese troubles is due in part to the lack, until recently, of\r\ninstruments for examining the eye and for manufacturing glasses to\r\ncorrect eye defects; in part, also, to the tendency of the medical\r\nprofession, which I shall repeatedly mention, to explain disorders by\r\ncauses remote and hard to find rather than by those near at hand.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870 Dr. S. Weir Mitchell's attention was called \"to the marked\r\nrelief of headache, insomnia, and other reflex symptoms following the\r\ncorrection of optical defects by glasses.\" In 1874 and 1876 he wrote\r\ntwo articles that \"impressed upon the general profession the grave\r\nsignificance of eye strain.\" Since that time, \"in Philadelphia at\r\nleast, no study of the rebellious cause of headache or of the obscure\r\nnervous diseases has ever been considered complete until a careful\r\nexamination of the eyes has included them as a possible cause of the\r\ndisturbance.\"\r\n\r\nThe new fact, therefore, is not weak eyes or strained eyes, but rather\r\n(1) an increase in the regular misuse of eyes by school children,\r\nseamstresses, stenographers, lawyers, etc.; and (2) the incipient\r\npropaganda growing out of school tests that show the relation of eye\r\nstrain to headache, nervous diseases, stomach disorder, truancy,\r\nbackwardness.\r\n\r\nEvery school, private and parochial as well as public, should supply\r\nitself with the Snellen card for testing eyes. Employers would do well\r\nto have these cards in evidence also, for they may greatly increase\r\nprofits by decreasing inefficiency and risks. If there is no expert\r\noptician near, apply for cards to your health board or school board;\r\nfailing there, write to your state health and school boards. In many\r\nstates rural teachers are already supplied with these cards by state\r\nboards. In October, 1907, the New York state board of health sent out\r\ncards, with instructions for their use, to 446 incorporated towns. The\r\nstate commissioner of education also sent a letter giving school\r\nreasons for using the cards. Results from 415 schools having shown\r\nthat nearly half the children had optical defects, it is proposed to\r\nsecure state legislation that will make eye tests obligatory in all\r\nschools. Such a test in Massachusetts recently discovered twenty-two\r\nper cent of the school children with defective vision, and from forty\r\nto fifty thousand in need of immediate care by specialists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: POSITIONS OFTEN SUGGEST EYE STRAIN]\r\n\r\nOf course eye specialists,--oculists,--if skillful, know more about\r\neyes and eye troubles than general medical practitioners or teachers.\r\nPreliminary eye tests, however, may be made by any accurate person who\r\ncan read. The Massachusetts state board of health reports that tests\r\nmade by teachers were \"not less efficient\" than tests made by\r\nspecialists. In June, 1907, a group of eminent oculists recommended to\r\nthe school board of New York City that teachers make this first test\r\nafter being instructed by oculists. Persons interested in the schools\r\nnearest them can quickly interest teachers and pupils by starting tests\r\nwith this card. In cities oculists can be found who will be glad to\r\nexplain to teachers, individually or in groups, how the cards should be\r\nused and what dangers to avoid.\r\n\r\nNature intended the human eye to read the last line of this card at a\r\ndistance of ten feet. This conclusion is not a guess, but is based upon\r\nthe examination of thousands of eyes. In making the test, the number of\r\nfeet the eye ought to see is written as the denominator of the\r\nfraction; the distance the eye can see clearly is the numerator. If the\r\nchild's card reads, \"Right eye 10/10, left eye 10/20,\" it means that\r\nthe right eye sees without conscious strain the distance it is intended\r\nto see, while the left eye must be within ten feet to see what it ought\r\nto see twenty feet away.\r\n\r\nThe practical steps for a teacher to take in making eye tests are:\r\n\r\n  1. Scrutinize the faces for a strained or worried expression while\r\n  reading or writing, for squint eyes, for unnatural positions, and\r\n  for improper distances (more or less than nine inches) from eye to\r\n  book.\r\n\r\n  2. Select for first tests the children who obviously need\r\n  attention and will be obviously benefited. Use the eye test to\r\n  help trace the cause of headaches, nervousness, inattention.\r\n\r\n  3. Let the children mark off the distances with a foot rule and\r\n  chalk, going as high as twenty. Be sure to get the best light in\r\n  the room.\r\n\r\n  4. Start all children on the ten-foot line. If a child cannot read\r\n  at ten feet the letter which should be seen at that distance, move\r\n  the child forward, have it step forward and backward, and note the\r\n  result carefully. It is better to have ten separate letters of\r\n  exactly the right size and the same size than a row of letters on\r\n  one card, as in the Snellen test, otherwise memory will aid the\r\n  eye, or, as happened recently, a whole class may agree to feign\r\n  remarkable nearsightedness or farsightedness by confusing letters\r\n  learned in advance from the card. If the Snellen card is used, and\r\n  if it is more convenient to have both child and card stationary,\r\n  satisfactory results will be obtained by having the child read\r\n  from large letters down as far as he can see.\r\n\r\n  5. Have the child read from right to left, from left to right, or\r\n  skip about so that memory cannot aid the eye.\r\n\r\n  6. Test each eye separately. I was twenty-five years old before I\r\n  learned that my left eye did practically all of the close sight\r\n  work. A grown woman discovered just a few days ago that she was\r\n  almost blind in the left eye; when she rubbed the right one while\r\n  reading she was shocked to find that she could see nothing with\r\n  the left eye.\r\n\r\n  7. If the card is stationary and the child moved, and if only one\r\n  size of the letter is used, put in the denominator the number of\r\n  feet at which the normal eye should see clearly, and in the\r\n  numerator the distance at which each eye and both together can\r\n  easily see. If the regular Snellen card is used containing letters\r\n  of different size, place in the denominator the number of the\r\n  lowest line each eye and both eyes together can read easily, and\r\n  in the numerator the number of feet from card to eye.\r\n\r\n  8. Explain the result to the child, to his fellows, to his\r\n  parents. If the left eye reads 10/20 and the right eye 10/30, it\r\n  means that neither eye is normal, and that reading small type is a\r\n  constant strain, even though unnoticed. The right eye must be\r\n  within ten feet to read what it should read at twenty feet. The\r\n  left eye must be within ten feet to read what it should read at\r\n  thirty feet. If the two eyes read at ten, it means that in working\r\n  together they successfully strain for a result that is not worth\r\n  what it is costing. When eyes thus unconsciously see what they are\r\n  not intended to see, it is only a matter of time when stomach and\r\n  nervous system will announce that the strain can no longer be\r\n  borne. Indigestion, dislike of study, restlessness follow. If,\r\n  however, the eyes are so near the normal that their story reads\r\n  12/10 or 8/10, the strain will be negligible _for the present_.\r\n  If, on the other hand, the only difficulty is a confusion of _x_\r\n  and _z_ with _c_ and _g_, it means that there is a strain due to\r\n  astigmatism, and that the child should be sent to an oculist.\r\n\r\n  9. Teach children and parents (and practice what you preach) the\r\n  urgent importance of periodic reexamination, just as you would\r\n  teach them to visit a dentist twice a year. This is needed by\r\n  those who wear eyeglasses, and more particularly by those who have\r\n  recently put them on. Moreover, as shown below, it is needed by\r\n  children able to pass satisfactorily the Snellen test.\r\n\r\n  10. Acquire the habit of reading the eye for evidence of temperate\r\n  or intemperate living, sleeping, eating, dancing, drinking, and\r\n  smoking. Inflamed eyes are _results_,--signals of danger. \"The\r\n  organ may be faultless in construction and in its work poor,\r\n  because of nerve exhaustion, or, in a less and more easily\r\n  recoverable degree, nerve fatigue.\" If unusual eye conditions are\r\n  not readily explained by mode of living or by eye tests, an\r\n  oculist should be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the card test must be constantly kept in mind: (1) it\r\ndoes not register eye sickness due to dust, smoke, or disease germs;\r\n(2) it does not show unconscious eye strain due to successful\r\naccommodation. But it will discover a great part of the children who\r\nmost need care. Sooner or later, too, inflammation of the eyelids, due\r\nto external causes, will affect the nerves of the eye and their power\r\nto conceal by accommodation the eye's defects. Just as we unconsciously\r\nopen the mouth when a cold stops up the nose, the eye adapts itself to\r\nour needs without our realizing it. We expect it to see. It sees. If\r\nour eyes are not made alike, they do their best to work together. Like\r\na good team of horses, the slow one hurries, the fast one holds back a\r\nlittle. But if one eye is 10/15 and the other 10/10, they will both be\r\nunnatural and strained if both read the same type. The effects of this\r\nstrain frequently upset the stomach before the eyes rebel. I learned\r\nthat I needed eyeglasses after a case of protracted indigestion, first\r\ndiagnosed as \"nervous\" and later traced to eyes. Thousands of\r\nupper-grade children and college students are dieting for stomach\r\ntrouble that will last until the eyes are relieved of the undue and\r\nunrecognized strain. To prove the influence of eye strain on\r\nindigestion, persuade some obstinate parent to wear improperly focused\r\nglasses for a day; she will then be willing to have her child's eyes\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the eyes will overwork without protesting. For\r\nyears many persons suffer without learning that their eyes are unlike,\r\nor, as often happens, that one eye does all the close range work. Even\r\nwhen being tested, eyes will seem to see easily what requires a great\r\neffort of \"accommodation.\" To prevent this self-deception skilled\r\noculists do not trust the eye card, but put a drug in the eye that\r\nbenumbs the muscles of accommodation. They cannot contract or expand if\r\nthey want to. The oculist then studies the length of the eye and the\r\nmuscle of accommodation. With this absolute knowledge of how each eye\r\nis made he knows what is wrong, exactly at what angle light enters the\r\neye, whether objects are focused too soon or too late, exactly what\r\nkind of eyeglasses or what operation upon the eye is needed to enable\r\nit to do its work without undue straining or accommodation. So\r\nunconsciously do the eyes accommodate themselves to the work expected\r\nof them that not infrequently a child with seemingly perfect sight may\r\nbe more in need of glasses than the child with imperfect sight.\r\nPractically, however, it is out of the question at the present time to\r\nhave the majority of children given a more thorough test than that\r\nprovided by the Snellen card. Where eye strains escape this test\r\nteachers will find evidence in complaints of headache, nervousness,\r\nsick stomach, chorea, or even epilepsy. The constant strain may also\r\ncause red or inflamed lids. Parents and teachers must be on the\r\nconstant lookout for these symptoms of good sight persisting in spite\r\nof imperfect eyes.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic of eyeglasses is usually the consequence of eye tests. So\r\nnaturally do we associate eyeglasses with eye defects that some people\r\nassert that the eye tests at school originate with opticians more\r\nintent upon selling spectacles than upon helping children. In fact,\r\neven among educators who proclaim the need for eye tests there has been\r\nfar more talk of eyeglasses than of removable conditions that cause eye\r\nstrain. The women principals of New York City have sounded an alarm,\r\nand urge more attention to light and to reading position, more rest,\r\nmore play, more hand work, less home study and less eye work at school,\r\nrather than more eyeglasses to conceal temporarily the effect of\r\nabusing children's eyes. Putting glasses on children without changing\r\ncausal conditions is like giving alcohol to consumptives. The feeling\r\nof relief is deceptive. The trouble grows worse.\r\n\r\nFor some time to come eye tests will find eye troubles by the wholesale\r\nin every industrial and social class, in country as well as city\r\nschools. In 415 New York villages 48.7 per cent of school children had\r\ndefects of vision,--this without testing children under seven,--while\r\n11.3 per cent had sore eyes.\r\n\r\nThere are three possible ways of remedying defects: (1) changing the\r\neye by operation; (2) changing the light as it enters the eye by\r\neyeglasses; (3) decreasing the demands made upon the eye. To change\r\neyes or light requires a technical skill which few physicians as yet\r\npossess. It will be remembered that it is but thirty years since the\r\nmedical profession in America first began to understand the relation of\r\neye defects to other defects. Until a generation of physicians has been\r\ntrained by medical colleges to learn the facts about the eye and to\r\napply scientific remedies, it is especially necessary that teachers and\r\nparents reduce the demands made upon children's eyes; oral can be\r\nsubstituted for written work, manual for optical work, relaxed and\r\nnatural movement for discipline, outdoor exercise for less home study.\r\nOther requirements are suitable light and proper position, and\r\nabolition of shiny paper, shiny blackboard, and fine print. Even after\r\nit is easy to obtain the correction of eye defects it will still be\r\nnecessary to adapt the demands upon children's eyes to the strength and\r\nshape of those eyes. Because we are born farsighted, nearsighted, and\r\nastigmatic, we must be watchful to eradicate conditions that aggravate\r\nthese troubles. Finally, there is no excuse whatever for permitting the\r\nparent of any school child in the United States to remain ignorant of\r\nthe fact that it is just as absurd to go to the druggist or jeweler for\r\neyeglasses as to the hardware store for false teeth.\r\n\r\nThe education of physician, oculist, and optician can be expedited by\r\neye tests in school and by the follow-up work of schools in removing\r\nthe prejudice of parents against glasses when needed. Because knowledge\r\nof chemistry preceded knowledge of the human body, the teaching of\r\nmedicine still shows the effect of predilection for the remote, the\r\nproblematical, the impossible. This predilection has influenced many\r\nspecialists as well as many general practitioners, both overlooking too\r\nfrequently obvious causes that even intelligent laymen can be taught to\r\ndetect. Very naturally the man who makes money out of attention to\r\nsimple troubles has stepped into the field not as yet occupied by the\r\ngeneral practitioner and the specialist. Thus we have the optician, the\r\npainless tooth extractor, and quack cures for consumption. Opticians\r\nare placing before hundreds of thousands simple truths about the eye\r\nnot otherwise taught as yet. Because they make their money by selling\r\neyeglasses and because their special knowledge pertains to glasses\r\nrather than to eyes they frequently fail to recognize their\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\nPhysicians feel very strongly that it is as unethical for an optician\r\nto fit eyeglasses without a physician's prescription as for a\r\npharmacist to give drugs without a physician's prescription. The\r\njustification for this feeling should be based not upon the commercial\r\nmotive of the optician but upon his ignorance. A physician uninformed\r\nas to eye troubles is just as unsafe as an optician determined to sell\r\nglasses. It must be made unethical and unprofessional for physician and\r\noptician alike to prescribe in the dark. Laymen and physicians must be\r\ntaught that it is just as unethical and unprofessional for oculists and\r\nphysicians to fail to bring their knowledge within the practical reach\r\nof the masses as for the optician to advertise his wares. School tests\r\nwill not have been used to their utmost possibilities until optician\r\nand physician alike take the ethical position that the first\r\nconsideration is the patient's welfare, not their own profits. It must\r\nsoon be recognized as unethical and unprofessional for an optician who\r\nis also a skilled physician to refer patients to a medical practitioner\r\nignorant as to optical science.\r\n\r\nWhether opticians and physicians are unprofessional or unethical may be\r\ntold by reexamination if the _examiner_ is himself competent and\r\nethical. There is no better judge of their efficiency than the patient\r\nhimself, who can tell whether the results promised have been effected.\r\nWhether the work of a country oculist is efficient and ethical can be\r\nlearned: (1) by teaching country school children to recognize eye\r\nstrain; (2) by comparing his results with those of other physicians. As\r\nsoon as one or two states have tested eyes, we shall have an average by\r\nwhich to compare each class, school, and city with others of their size\r\nunder similar conditions. If a particular physician finds half as many\r\nmore or only half the average number, the presumption will be that his\r\nresults are inaccurate and warrant an investigation. The interested\r\nteacher or parent can render an inestimable service to her local school\r\nand to the children of her state by taking steps to secure state laws\r\ncompelling eye tests in all schools.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be remembered by teachers, employers, parents, and all\r\neye users that eyes are constantly changing; that eyes may need glasses\r\nsix months after they are examined and found sound; that glasses change\r\nor develop the eye, so that they may be unnecessary and harmful six\r\nmonths after they are prescribed, or the eye may require a stronger\r\nglass; that eyeglasses become bent and scratched, so that they worry\r\nand strain the eye; that a periodic examination is essential to the\r\nhealth of the eye.\r\n\r\nIn caring for the health of the eye, we should also remember that our\r\neyes are our chief interpreters of the world that gives us problems,\r\nprofits, and pleasures. Out of gratitude, if not out of enlightened\r\nself-interest, we owe our eyes protection, attention, and training, so\r\nthat without straining we shall always be able to see truth and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nEAR TROUBLE, MALNUTRITION, DEFORMITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of adenoids is a frequent cause of both slight and\r\naggravated deafness. Of 156 deaf mutes examined 59 per cent had\r\nadenoids, while only 6 per cent of the general run of the children in\r\nthe neighborhood had this trouble. In mouth breathing, the current of\r\nair entering the mouth draws out some of the air from the Eustachian\r\ntube which ventilates the middle ear and unequalizes the atmospheric\r\npressure on the eardrum, causing it to sink in and to blunt the\r\nhearing. An examination of the eardrums of school children in New York\r\nwho are mouth breathers showed a high percentage of deafness, incipient\r\nor pronounced, accompanying adenoids. For example, of 9 mouth breathers\r\nselected from one class (average age 7-8 years), 6 were well-marked\r\ncases of deafness. Of 8 mouth breathers (average age 8-9 years), and of\r\n5 mouth breathers (average age 5-6 years), all had noticeable defects\r\nof hearing. Many adults that suffer from deafness maintain that they\r\nnever had any trouble in childhood. Yet the evidences of nose and\r\nthroat trouble in childhood persist and disprove such statements. _The\r\nfoundations of deafness in later life are, in most instances, laid in\r\nchildhood._ Since the majority of cases of ear trouble occurring in\r\nschool children accompany diseased conditions of the nose and throat,\r\nthe proper care of nose and throat will, in large measure, balance the\r\nshortcomings of the aural examinations. Since the examination of the\r\ndrum itself is not practicable, especial care should be given to the\r\nexamination of the nose and throat.\r\n\r\nThe figures published by New York City's department of health show that\r\nof 274,641 children examined from March, 1905, to January, 1908, 3540,\r\nor 1.2 per cent, gave evidence of defective hearing. Ear specialists\r\nsuggest that this small percentage results from employing the whisper\r\ntest at twenty feet. The whisper test at sixty feet has been set by\r\nexperts as a test of normal hearing. But preciseness with this test is\r\nwell-nigh impossible when we consider that the acoustics, the quality\r\nof the examiner's voice, the weather, the vowel or consonant sounds,\r\nall are variable quantities. The watch test is frequently used, but\r\nsince a young teacher in her enthusiasm used an alarm clock to make the\r\ntest, specialists have decided that the volume of sound differs in\r\nwatches to such a degree as to make the watch test unreliable. The\r\nexamination of the eye has been reduced to mathematical precision, due\r\naltogether to the anatomy of that organ. As yet there is no instrument\r\nfor the ear comparable to the ophthalmoscope. The acoumeter is largely\r\nused by aurists and can be obtained from the optician. This instrument\r\nhas an advantage over the whisper or watch tests in that its tick is\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nEach ear should be tested separately. Let the child place his finger\r\nagainst the flap of one ear while the other is being tested. Then\r\ncompare the farthest distance from the ear at which the tick can be\r\nheard with the normal, standard distance. During the test all sound\r\nshould be eliminated as far as possible and the eyes should be closed.\r\nAt a demonstration of ear testing at Teachers College, one student\r\nstated that she could not hear the tick of the watch at a distance\r\ngreater than twenty inches. Then the tester walked noisily toward her,\r\nleaving the watch on the desk, five feet away from the patient. She\r\nheard it now. When the class burst out laughing she opened her eyes,\r\nand, seeing the watch so far away, exclaimed, \"Why, I thought I\r\nimagined it.\" Be careful in testing a child to distinguish between what\r\nhe \"thinks he imagines\" and what he really hears. Because of the\r\ndifficulties of this test a doubt should be sufficient to warn the\r\nteacher to send the child to be tested by an expert. Detection of\r\nslight deafness may lead to the discovery of serious defects of nose or\r\nthroat. Inflammation from cold or catarrh may cause deafness, which if\r\nneglected may permanently injure the ear. Often deafness is due to an\r\naccumulation of wax. A running ear should receive immediate attention,\r\nas it is an indication of inflammation which may imperil the integrity\r\nof the eardrum, and, if neglected, may eat its way through the thin\r\npartition between the ear and the brain and cause death.\r\n\r\nIt should never be assumed that deafness is incurable. Stupidity,\r\ninattention, and slowness to grasp a situation accompany difficulty of\r\nhearing and should cause the teacher to examine the ears. No ear\r\ntrouble is negligible. Children and parents should be taught that the\r\nnormal ear is intended to hear for us, not to divert our attention to\r\nitself. When the ear aches or \"runs\" or rumbles there is something\r\nwrong, and it should be examined together with the throat and nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUSNESS\r\n\r\nIn New York City one child in ninety-one already examined has had the\r\nform of nervous disease known as St. Vitus's Dance, or chorea. So prone\r\nare we to overlook moderate evils and moderate needs that the child\r\nwith aggravated St. Vitus's Dance is apt to be cured sooner than the\r\nchild who is just \"nervous.\" Teachers cannot know whether twitching\r\neyes, emotional storms, constant motion of the fingers or feet are due\r\nto chorea, to malnutrition, to eye strain, or to habits acquired in\r\nbabyhood or early childhood and continued for the advantage that\r\naccrues when discipline impends. Many a child treasures as his chief\r\nasset in time of trouble the ability to lose his temper, to have a\r\n\"fit,\" to exhibit nervousness that frightens parent, teacher, or\r\nplaymate, incites their pity, and wards off punishment. The school\r\nexamination will settle once for all whether the trouble can be cured.\r\nThe family physician will explain what steps to take.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS OF MALNUTRITION\r\n\r\nWe Americans were first interested in the physical examination of\r\nschool children by exaggerated estimates of the number of children who\r\nare underfed. As fast as figures were obtained for eye defects,\r\nbreathing defects, bad teeth, some one was ready to declare that these\r\nwere results of underfeeding. Hence the conclusion: give children at\r\nleast one meal a day at school. Scientific men began to set us straight\r\nand to give undernourishment a technical meaning,--soft bones, flabby\r\ntissue, under size, anaemia. While too little food might cause this\r\ncondition, it was also explained that too much food of the wrong sort,\r\nor even food of the right sort eaten irregularly or hurriedly or\r\npoisoned by bad teeth, might also cause undernourishment, including the\r\nextreme type known as malnutrition. In extreme instances the symptoms\r\nenable an observant teacher who has learned to distinguish between the\r\npretty hair ribbon and clean collar and the sunken, pale, or hectic\r\ncheek and lusterless eyes to detect the cause. But as with eyes and\r\nnose, an unhealthy condition of nourishment may exist long before\r\noutward symptoms are noticeable. Therefore the value of the periodic\r\nsearching examination by the school physician.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SAME AGE, SAME SCHOOL, DIFFERENT NUTRITION]\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE TUBERCULOSIS; ORTHOPEDIC TESTS\r\n\r\nOnly recently have we laymen learned that knee trouble, clubfoot, ankle\r\nsores, spine and hip troubles, scrofula, running sores at joints, etc.,\r\nare not hereditary and inevitable, but are rather the direct result of\r\ncarelessness on the part of adult consumptives. These conditions in\r\nschool are indices of homes and houses where tuberculosis is or has\r\nbeen active, and of health boards that are or have been inactive in\r\nchecking the white plague. Early examination may disclose the small\r\nlump on the child's spine,--which one mother diagnosed as inherited\r\n\"round shoulders,\"--and save a child from being a humpback for life.\r\nMoreover, the examination of the crippled child's brothers and sisters\r\nwill often show the beginnings of pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A GRIEVOUS PENALTY FOR NEGLECT BY ADULT\r\n    CONSUMPTIVES]\r\n\r\n\r\nENLARGED GLANDS--TUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\nIn almost every class are one or more children who are proud of small\r\nor big lumps under one or more jaws. Only physicians can find very\r\nsmall lumps. Many family doctors will say, \"Oh, he will outgrow those,\"\r\nor \"Those lumps will be absorbed.\" Like most other evils that we\r\n\"outgrow\" or that pass away, these lumps shriek not to be neglected.\r\nThey mean interference with nourishment and prevent proper action of\r\nthe lymphatic system, as adenoids prevent free breathing. Even when not\r\nactually infected with tubercle bacilli, they are fertile soil for the\r\nproduction of these germs. If detected early, they point to home\r\nconditions and personal habits that can be easily corrected. In New\r\nYork one child in four has these enlarged glands. If the same\r\nproportion prevails in other parts of the United States, there are\r\n5,400,000 children whose strength is being needlessly drained, many of\r\nwhom, if neglected, will need repeated operations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MODEL OF AMERICA'S FIRST HOSPITAL FOR SEASHORE\r\n    FRESH-AIR TREATMENT OF NONPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN\r\n    To be erected at Rockaway Beach, New York City]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDENTAL SANITATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have their teeth attended to first, and many of the eye defects will\r\ndisappear.\" This was an unexpected contribution to the debate upon free\r\neyeglasses for the school children of New York City. So little do most\r\nof us realize the importance of sound, clean teeth, and the\r\ninterrelation of stomach and sense nerves, that even the school\r\nprincipals thought the eye specialist was exaggerating when he declared\r\nthat bad teeth cause indigestion and indigestion causes eye strain.\r\n\r\n\"Bad\" teeth mean to most people dirty teeth and offensive odors, loose,\r\ncrooked, or isolated teeth, or black stumps. Even among dentists a\r\ngreat many, probably the majority, do not appreciate that \"bad\" teeth\r\nmean indigestion, lowered vitality, plague spots for contaminating\r\nsound teeth and for breeding disease germs. Until recently the only\r\nrule about the teeth of new recruits in the United States army was:\r\n\"There must be two opposing molars on each side of the mouth. It\r\ndoesn't matter how rotten these molars may be.\" The surgeon general was\r\npersuaded to change to \"four opposing molars on each side\"; still\r\nnothing as to the condition of the two additional molars! In the German\r\narmy there is a regular morning inspection of teeth and toothbrushes.\r\nSeveral German insurance companies give free dental treatment to policy\r\nholders, not to bestow charity but to increase profits.\r\n\r\nNeglecting \"baby teeth\" and adenoids may mean crooked second teeth that\r\nwill cause: (1) hundreds of dollars for straightening; (2) permanent\r\nbusiness handicap because crooked teeth are disagreeable to others,\r\nbecause mastication is less perfect, and because a disfigured mouth\r\nmeans dis-arranged nerves; or perhaps (3) large dental bills because it\r\nis difficult to clean between cramped, crooked teeth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the great majority of parents rarely think of their\r\nchildren's teeth until too late to preserve them intact. Even among\r\nfamilies where the rule of brushing the teeth twice daily prevails,\r\nregular dental examination is often not required. Doctors and dentists\r\nthemselves have not been trained to realize that the teeth are a most\r\ndangerous source of infection when unclean. Does your dentist insist\r\nupon removing tartar and food particles beyond your reach, upon\r\npolishing and cleansing, or does he regard these as vanity touches, to\r\nbe omitted if you are in a hurry?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INDUSTRIAL HANDICAPS DISCOVERED AT SCHOOL]\r\n\r\nPhysicians send tuberculosis patients to hospitals or camps without\r\ncorrecting the mouth conditions that make it impossible for the patient\r\nto eat or swallow without infecting himself. Tonics are given to women\r\nwhose teeth are breeding and harboring disease germs that tear down\r\nvitality. Nurses watch their suffering patients and do the heavier\r\ntasks heroically, but are not trained to teach the simple truths about\r\ndental hygiene. The far-reaching results of neglect of teeth will not\r\nbe understood until greater emphasis is placed on the bacteriology, the\r\neconomics, the sociology, and the aesthetics of clean, sound teeth.\r\nWhether or not there is at present a tendency to exaggerate the\r\nimportance of sound teeth, there is no difference of opinion as to the\r\nfact that the teeth harbor virulent germs, that the high temperature of\r\nthe mouth favors germ propagation, that the twenty to thirty square\r\ninches of surface constantly open to bacterial infection offer an\r\nextensive breeding ground, and that the formation of the teeth invites\r\nthe lodgment of germs and of particles of food injurious both to teeth\r\nand to other organs.\r\n\r\nBy scraping the teeth with the finger nail and noticing the odor you\r\ncan convince yourself of the presence of decomposing organic matter not\r\nhealthful to be carried into the stomach. By applying a little iodine\r\nand then washing it off with water, your teeth may show stains. These\r\nstains are called gelatinous plaques, which are transparent and\r\ninvisible to the naked eye except when colored by iodine. These plaques\r\nprotect the germs, which ferment and create the acid which destroys\r\ntooth structure. Their formation can be prevented by vigorous brushing\r\nand by eating hard food.\r\n\r\nThe individual with decayed teeth, even with unclean teeth, is open to\r\ninfection of the lungs, tonsils, stomach, glands, ears, nose, and\r\nadenoid tissues. Every time food is taken, and at every act of\r\nswallowing, germs flow over the tonsils into the stomach. Mouth\r\nbreathers with teeth in this condition cannot get one breath of\r\nuncontaminated air, for every breath becomes infected with poisonous\r\nemanations from the teeth. Bad teeth are frequently the sole cause of\r\nbad breath and dyspepsia, and can convey to the system tuberculosis of\r\nthe lungs, glands, stomach, or nose, and many other transmissible\r\ndiseases. They may also cause enlarged tonsils and ear trouble.\r\n\r\nApart from decomposing food and stagnant septic matter from saliva\r\ninjured by indigestion, and by sputum which collects in the healthy\r\nmouth, there are in many infected mouths pus, exudations from the\r\nirritated and inflamed gum margins, gaseous emanations from decaying\r\nteeth, putrescent pulp tissue, tartar, and chemical poisons. Every\r\nspray from such a mouth in coughing, sneezing, or even talking or\r\nreading, is laden with microbes which vitiate the air to be breathed by\r\nothers. Indigestion from imperfect mastication and imperfect salivation\r\n(themselves often due solely to bad teeth) is far less serious than\r\nindigestion from germ infection. Germs taken into the stomach can so\r\nchange the composition of saliva (a natural disinfectant when healthy)\r\nas to render it no longer able to kill germs. Indigestion may result in\r\nexcess of uric acid and toxic material, so that the individual becomes\r\nsubject to gout and rheumatism, which in turn frequently destroy the\r\nbony support of the teeth and bring about Riggs's Disease. The last\r\nnamed is a prevalent and disfiguring disease, whose symptom is receding\r\ngums. The irritating toxins deposited on the teeth cause inflammation\r\nof the tissues at the gum margins. The gums withdraw more and more from\r\nsections of the teeth; the poisons get underneath and work back toward\r\nthe roots; the infection increases and hastens the loosening of the\r\nteeth. I know of a man who had all of his teeth extracted at twenty-one\r\nyears of age, because he was told that this was the only treatment for\r\nthis disease, which was formerly thought to be incurable. Yet thorough\r\ncleansing and removal of this matter from under the edges of the gums,\r\ndisinfection, a few visits to the dentist, will stop the recession but\r\ncannot regain lost ground.\r\n\r\nAmong those who regularly use the toothbrush, instinct, comfort, or\r\ndisplay is the ruling motive, while a small percentage have evolved to\r\nthe anti-nuisance stage, where the aesthetic standard of their group\r\nforbids any member to neglect his teeth. The anti-slum and pro-slum\r\nmotives for mouth cleanliness and dental sanitation have been awakened\r\nin but one or two places. A significant pro-slum activity is the dental\r\nclinic organized by forty volunteer dentists, acting for an industrial\r\nschool maintained by the New York Children's Aid Society.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEW YORK CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY'S DENTAL CLINIC\r\n    FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN]\r\n\r\nHere 550 children have been examined, 447 teeth extracted, 284 teeth\r\nfilled, 200 teeth treated for diseased pulp (and only 24 sets cleaned),\r\n40 dentists taking turns in giving time to this work. The equipment\r\ncost but $239; cards and stationery, $72; incidentals, $33. The\r\nprincipal attends the clinic, because in her presence no child is\r\nwilling to confess fear or unwillingness. To supplement this work, the\r\ndentists have prepared for free distribution a leaflet which tells in\r\nshort, clear sentences how to care for the teeth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (leaflet)]\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n | A DENTAL CATECHISM                 =When should they be cleansed?=   |\r\n |                                                                      |\r\n | =What are the teeth for?=          Immediately after the morning and |\r\n |                                    noonday meals and before going to |\r\n | To masticate food; that is,        bed.                              |\r\n | grind it into fine particles,                                        |\r\n | mix it with saliva, and so         =By what means should they be     |\r\n | begin its digestion; also to       cleansed?=                        |\r\n | aid in speaking and singing.                                         |\r\n |                                    By a moderately stiff brush,      |\r\n | =How long should they last?=       water, and floss silk.            |\r\n |                                                                      |\r\n | To the very end of life.           =How should these be used?=       |\r\n |                                                                      |\r\n | =How do we lose them?=             The brush should be first used in |\r\n |                                    a general way, high up on the     |\r\n | By decay, by loosening, and by     gums length-wise of the jaws, to  |\r\n | accident.                          remove large particles and        |\r\n |                                    stimulate the gums, then the      |\r\n | =What causes teeth to decay?=      brush and the teeth should be     |\r\n |                                    carefully rinsed with water.

Examination and reexamination must be accompanied by\r\nexplanation of the serious disadvantages of neglected teeth, and the\r\nphysical, social, and economic advantages of clean, sound teeth.\r\nInstruction at school must be followed by education of parents. The\r\nschool or health authorities should examine the teeth of all children\r\nbefore issuing work certificates. Finally, the dental, medical, and\r\nnursing professions and the press must be enlisted in the school's\r\ncampaign for dental hygiene. The Dental Hygiene Council of\r\nMassachusetts should be copied in all states.\r\n\r\nA preliminary examination of teeth can be made by parent or teacher.\r\nCrooked, loose, dirty, or black teeth or receding gums can be detected\r\nby a layman's naked eye. In fact, children can be interested in finding\r\nthe most obvious defects in their own or their brothers' teeth. There\r\ncould be no better first lesson than to ask each pupil to look in a\r\nhand mirror and to count each tooth obviously needing a cleaning or a\r\nfilling. The most urgent need can thus be ascertained without expert\r\naid. But because parent, teacher, or child cannot discover defects does\r\nnot prove that dental care is not imperative; hence the importance of\r\nexamination by a dentist or by a physician competent to discover dental\r\nneeds. If a private, public, or parochial school has no paid visiting\r\ndentist, a zealous school officer can, at least in large towns,\r\npersuade one or more dentists or physicians to make a few first tests\r\nto confirm the teacher's findings, and to persuade the community that\r\nregular examination and reexamination are necessary and a saving of\r\npain, beauty, and money.\r\n\r\nReexamination is necessary because decay _may_ start the day after a\r\ndentist has pronounced a tooth sound. For most of us twice a year is\r\noften enough. A reexamination should be made upon the slightest\r\nsuspicion of decay, breaking, or loosening.\r\n\r\nEducational use should be made by the teacher of the results of school\r\nexamination. Children cannot be made self-conscious and cleanly by\r\ntelling them that their teeth will ache three or five years from now.\r\nThey can be made to brush or wash their teeth every morning and every\r\nnight if they once realize that cavities can be caused only by _mouth\r\ngarbage_. All decay of human teeth starts from the outside through the\r\nenamel that covers the soft bone of the tooth. This enamel can be\r\ndestroyed by accidentally cracking or breaking it, or by acids eating\r\ninto it. These acids come from (1) particles of food allowed to remain\r\nin the teeth; (2) tartar, etc., that adheres to the teeth and can be\r\nremoved only by a dentist; (3) saliva brought up from an\r\nill-conditioned stomach. Even where the enamel is destroyed, absolute\r\ncleanliness will prevent serious decay of the tooth. A perfectly clean\r\ntooth will not decay. Generally speaking, unless particles of food or\r\nremovable acids remain on or between the teeth long enough to\r\ndecompose, teeth cannot decay. Decay always means, therefore,\r\nuncleanliness. To unclean teeth is due in large part the offensive odor\r\nof many schoolrooms.\r\n\r\nUncleanliness becomes noticeable to our neighbors sooner or later.\r\nThere is no offense we are so reluctant to commit as that of having\r\nuncleanliness of our bodies disagreeable to those about us. Very young\r\nchildren will make every effort in their power to live up to the\r\nschool's standard of cleanliness. The other side to this reason for\r\nhaving clean teeth is vanity. Because all cleanliness is beautiful to\r\nus, clean teeth are one attribute of beauty that all of us can possess.\r\n\r\nHabits of cleanliness are easily fixed. In the most crowded, most\r\noverworked section of large cities visitors from \"uptown\" are surprised\r\nby the children's bright hair ribbons, clean aprons, clean faces, and\r\nsmoothly combed hair. It will be easy to add clean teeth to the list of\r\nthings necessary to personal and family standing. Armenian children\r\nare taught to clean their teeth after eating, even if only an apple\r\nbetween meals. They covet \"beautiful teeth.\" American standards will\r\nsoon prevent these Armenians from cleaning their teeth in public, but\r\ndesire for beautiful teeth will stay, and will remind them to care for\r\ntheir teeth in private. As coarse food gives way to sugars and soft\r\nfoods, stiff toothbrushes must supplement tongue and toothpicks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: AN ARMENIAN SCHOOL GIRL]\r\n\r\nStrong as are the instinct and display motives in cleaning teeth, both\r\nparents and children need to be reached through the commerce motive.\r\nInstinct makes children afraid of the dentist, or content when the\r\ntooth stops aching. Display may be satisfied with cleaning the front\r\nteeth, as many boys comb only the front hair or as girls hide dirty\r\nscalps under pompadours and pretty ribbons. Desire to save money may\r\ngive stronger reasons for not going to the dentist than instinct and\r\ncomfort can urge for going. But parents can be made to see, as can\r\nchildren after they begin to picture themselves as wage earners, that a\r\ndentist in time saves nine, and that no regular family investment will\r\nearn more money than the price of prompt and regular dental care. A\r\nproblem in arithmetic would be convincing, if, by questions such as\r\nthose on page 98, we could compare the family cost of neglecting teeth\r\nwith the cost of toothbrushes, bicarbonate of soda, pulverized chalk or\r\ntooth powder, early and repeated examination by a dentist, and\r\ntreatment when needed.\r\n\r\n How many members in your family?     What does a toothbrush cost?\r\n\r\n How many teeth have they?            How many do you need in one\r\n                                      year?\r\n How many teeth have they lost?\r\n                                      How much does tooth powder\r\n How many false teeth have they?      cost?\r\n\r\n How many teeth have been filled?     How much is needed for one\r\n                                      year?\r\n What is the total cost to date?\r\n                                      How much would two examinations\r\n How many days have been lost         a year by a dentist cost?\r\n from work because of toothache?\r\n\r\n How many teeth are now decayed?\r\n\r\n What will it cost to have them\r\n attended to?\r\n\r\nThe result will show that the money spent for one good \"house cleaning\"\r\nof one child at fourteen or eighteen exceeds the cost of keeping clean\r\nand in repair the teeth of the entire family. How effective and\r\neconomical is thorough cleaning is confessed by an eminent dentist, who\r\ntaught an assistant to clean his patients' teeth. \"Do you know,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I had to stop it, so perceptibly did my work decrease.\" The\r\ntotal time required to examine school children for teeth needing\r\nattention is much less than the time now lost by absence from school or\r\nwasted at school on account of toothache.\r\n\r\nTo remind school children regularly of dental hygiene is not more\r\nimportant than for the school to remind parents repeatedly of the many\r\nreasons for attending to their children's teeth. It is not enough,\r\nhowever, to send one message to parents. Illustrated lectures, mothers'\r\nmeetings, demonstrations at hospitals and fresh-air homes are all very\r\nserviceable, but listening is a poor substitute for understanding.\r\nSchools should see that parents understand the aesthetics, the\r\neconomics, the humanity of dental hygiene. The best test of whether\r\nthe parent has understood is the child's tooth.\r\n\r\nDental examination of children applying for work certificates gives the\r\nhealth and school authorities a means of enforcing their precepts. When\r\nno child is allowed to go to work whose teeth cause malnutrition or\r\ndisgust, the news will spread, and both child and parent will see\r\nclearly the grave need for dental care.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WON BY THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT]\r\n\r\nFinally, local papers can be interested. They will print almost\r\nanything the teacher sends about the need for dental care. They like\r\nparticularly facts about the number of cavities found, the number of\r\nchildren needing care, efforts made to procure care, and new facts\r\nabout diseases that can be caused by bad teeth or about diseases that\r\ncan injure teeth. Teachers can persuade dentists and physicians to\r\nwrite stories. No newspaper will refuse to print such statements as\r\nthis: \"A tuberculous patient in six weeks lost ground steadily. I\r\npersuaded him to go to a dentist to clean the vestibule to his\r\ndigestive system, and to have a set of false teeth. He enjoys his\r\nmeals, and has gained twelve pounds in six weeks.\" Popular magazines\r\nand newspapers mention teeth seldom, because those who best know the\r\ninteresting vital things are making money, not writing articles or\r\notherwise concerning themselves with dental education. It is said that\r\nof forty thousand American dentists not over eleven thousand are\r\nreaders of dental journals, and probably not three hundred contribute\r\nto professional literature. One dentist who is working for the\r\nchildren's clinic described above, when asked by the board of education\r\nto lecture to the people on the care of the teeth and to recommend\r\nsimple, readable books, told me that he knew no good books to suggest.\r\n\r\nFive obstacles exist to practicing what is here preached:\r\n\r\n  1. The expensiveness of proper dentistry.\r\n\r\n  2. The untrustworthiness of cheap dental service and \"painless\"\r\n  dental parlors; the domination of the supply houses wishing to\r\n  sell instruments and other supplies.\r\n\r\n  3. The ethical objection to any kind of advertising or to work by\r\n  wholesale.\r\n\r\n  4. The lack of dispensaries.\r\n\r\n  5. The profit-making basis of dental education.\r\n\r\nAdditional reasons these for cleanliness that will make the dentist\r\nserviceable for his knowledge rather than for his time and gold.\r\n\r\nGood dentists really \"come too high\" for both the poor and the\r\ncomfortably situated. Families in New York City that have four or five\r\nthousand dollars a year hesitate to go to a dentist whom they\r\nthoroughly trust, because his time is worth more than they feel they\r\ncan afford to pay.\r\n\r\nThe \"free-extraction\" dental parlors undoubtedly are doing a vast\r\namount of harm. In every city are dental quacks that injure\r\nwage-earning adults as much as soothing-sirup quacks injure babies.\r\nInstead of teaching people to preserve their teeth, they extract, and\r\nthen, by dint of overpersuading by a pretty cashier hired for the\r\npurpose, make a contract for a gold crown or a false set at an\r\nexorbitant price. A reputable dentist has said that a dental parlor can\r\ndo more damage to the welfare of the race in a few months than a\r\nwell-intentioned man in the profession can repair in a lifetime. Its\r\nquestion is not, What can I do for this patient? but What is there in\r\nthis mouth for me? Many \"parlors\" never expect to see the same person\r\ntwice, because they do not make him comfortable or gain his confidence;\r\nthey put a filling in on top of decayed matter or even diseased pulp;\r\nput in plates and bridges that do not fit; charge more than the\r\nexamination at first leads one to expect; refuse to correct mistakes;\r\ndeny having ever seen the patient before. Yet true and severe as this\r\narraignment is, many of these parlors, with their liveried \"runners\r\nin,\" are doing an educational service not otherwise provided; it is\r\nconceivable that in many cities they are doing less harm by their\r\nmalpractice than well-intentioned men in the profession by neglect of\r\npublic needs or by failure to organize facilities for meeting those\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nI realize that advertising is \"unethical\" among dentists as among\r\nphysicians. Humbug and imposition are supposed to go inevitably with\r\nself-advertising by the methods used in selling shoes or automobiles.\r\nTherefore such advertising is prohibited. But what seems to be\r\nforgotten in this definition of ethics is that the need and the\r\nopportunity for dental care must be advertised in some way, if we are\r\never to control diseases and evils due to bad teeth. The rich that one\r\ndentist can help are able to pay for his good taste, his neat\r\nattendants, his automobile, his club dues, his vacations at fashionable\r\nresorts, his hours without work, his standard of living. All of these\r\nthings advertise him, just as hospital appointments and social position\r\nmay and do advertise successful physicians. The patients of moderate\r\nmeans that one dentist can treat cannot afford to pay for rent, time\r\ndisengaged, and indirect advertising. Either they must have free\r\ntreatment, must go without treatment, or must go to a dental parlor\r\nwhere dental needs are organized so that a very large number will\r\ncontribute to rent and display. It is out of the question to have both\r\ndentists and patients so distributed and prices so adjusted that\r\ndentists can make a good living by charging what the patient can\r\nafford, and at the same time admit of every patient being properly\r\ntreated when necessary. Judging from every other branch of work, the\r\nsolution of the problem lies partly in free care for those who can pay\r\nnothing or very little, and partly in cooeperative treatment through the\r\nheretofore objectionable dental parlors. If instead of inveighing\r\nagainst advertisers, honorable and capable dentists worked through\r\ndental and medical societies to secure adequate public supervision of\r\ndental practice, more progress would be made against dental\r\nmalpractice.\r\n\r\nDental clinics will quickly follow the publication of facts that\r\nschools should gather. In some places these should be separate; but at\r\nfirst the best thing is to make every hospital, every children's home,\r\nevery settlement a clinic, and every school an examining center. A\r\nskilled dentist informs me: \"The demand that will follow examination of\r\nschool children's teeth will make it profitable for young dentists to\r\nadopt a cooeperative scheme, where several young men hire a parlor in a\r\ncheap district, and, under the supervision of some experienced dentist,\r\ngive good advice at reasonable rates. This is the best antidote to the\r\ndental parlor which exploits the public so shamelessly.\" Bellevue\r\nHospital in New York is the first general hospital to establish regular\r\ndental examination; others will undoubtedly soon follow.\r\n\r\nDental education for profit rather than for instruction and for health\r\nhas been the rule. Even where universities have put in dental courses,\r\nthey have demanded a net profit from tuition. Instead of protecting\r\nsociety against men incapable of caring for teeth, the schools have\r\nmarketed certificates to as large numbers as slowly enlightened\r\nself-interest would permit. Much progress has been made toward uniform\r\nstandards of admission and graduation, but dental colleges sadly need\r\nthe light and the inspiration of school facts about teeth.\r\n\r\nOf fourteen dental journals in America, only one has the advancement of\r\ndental science as its first reason for existence. Thirteen are trade\r\njournals. Not one of these would print articles proving that the\r\nsupplies advertised by their backers were inimical to dental hygiene.\r\nMany dental colleges still retain on their faculties agents or editors\r\nin the pay of supply houses, Harvard's new dental school being a\r\nnotable exception. This trade motive tolerates and encourages the\r\ndisreputable practices of existing dental parlors. Largely because of\r\nthis prostitution of the dental profession, patients generally neglect\r\nthe repairing and cleansing of the teeth and the sterilizing of the\r\nmouth from which germs are carried to all parts of the body. Dental\r\njournalism for the sale of supplies cannot outlive the dentist's\r\nreading of the school's index.\r\n\r\nMany dentists will say that they must learn dentistry before they learn\r\nthe economics and sociology of clean teeth. Being a young profession,\r\nit is natural that dentistry should first devote itself to learning its\r\nown mechanics,--the tricks of the trade--how to fill teeth. But the\r\nfact that it took the medical profession centuries to begin to feel\r\nresponsibility for community health is no reason why the social sense\r\nof the dentist should be dormant for centuries or decades. We need\r\ntraining and exercise to determine what kind of filling will be most\r\ncomfortable and most serviceable; whether the pulp of the teeth needs\r\ntreating or removing before the filling is inserted; whether it is\r\nworth while to fill a deciduous or baby tooth. Sociology will never\r\ntake the place of dental technic. The few dentists who have studied the\r\nsocial significance and social responsibility of their profession\r\ndeclare, however, that careless workmanship and indifferent education\r\nof patients continue chiefly because dentists themselves do not see the\r\ncommunity's interest in dental hygiene. The school can socialize or\r\nhumanize the dental profession if teachers themselves possess the\r\nsocial sense and make known the facts about the need for dental care\r\namong school children.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _The Teeth and Their Care_, by Thaddeus P. Hyatt, D.D.S., is a\r\nshort, concise treatment of the principles of dental sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nABNORMALLY BRIGHT CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is commonly considered abnormal brightness in a school child is\r\noften a tendency to live an abnormal physical life. Being a child\r\nbookworm means that time is spent indoors that should be spent playing\r\ngames with one's fellows. Excellence in the activities of children, not\r\nability to imitate the activities of adults, should be the test of\r\nchild brightness. To be able to hit a bull's-eye, to throw a ball\r\naccurately, to calculate the swing of a curve or the bound of a\r\n\"grounder,\" these are tests of brightness quite as indicative of mental\r\npower as the ability to win highest marks in school, while less\r\ninjurious to physical power. The child who is abnormally bright\r\nrequires special treatment just as much as the child who is abnormally\r\ndull. The former as well as the latter must have his abnormal condition\r\ncorrected if he is to grow into a normally bright man.\r\n\r\nThe college man who sacrifices health to \"marks\" is thus described by\r\nthe director of physical training at Harvard University:\r\n\r\n  A drooping head, a pale face, dull, sunken eyes, flat chest and\r\n  rounded shoulders, with emaciated limbs, soft flabby muscles, and\r\n  general lack of good physical, mental, and moral tone.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of these physical defective grinds it is suggested\r\nto put a physical qualification upon the candidates of Phi Beta Kappa\r\nand their awards of scholarship. If scholarship men cannot be induced\r\nto take time to improve their physique for fear of lowering their\r\ncollege standing, then give them credit for standing in physical work.\r\n\r\nThe abnormally bright, at whatever age, is as much a subject for\r\nexamination and treatment as the child with adenoids and pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis. Such attention will increase the percentage of abnormally\r\nbright schoolmates who figure in active business in later life.\r\nMoreover, it will decrease the number of high school superintendents\r\nwho declare that their honor pupils are physical wrecks.\r\n\r\nThere are children who develop very rapidly, both physically and\r\nmentally, and whose mental superiority is not at the expense of their\r\nbodies. Protection of such children requires that their minds be\r\npermitted to progress as rapidly as bodily health justifies. It is as\r\ncruel to keep back a physically and mentally superior child, as to push\r\nthe physically or mentally defective beyond his powers. Worry and\r\nfatigue can be produced by lack of interest as well as by overwork.\r\n\"Normal\" should not be confused with \"average.\" To keep a bright child\r\nback with the average child--marking time till the dull ones catch\r\nup--is to make him abnormal. The tests that we have employed for\r\ngrading pupils are either the tests of age in years or of mental\r\ncapacity. The first takes no account of slowness or rapidity of\r\nphysiological development,--of physiological age. The second encourages\r\nmental activity at the expense of physique. The entrance of a child\r\ninto school, the promotion from one class to another, the entrance into\r\ncollege, are thus determined either by the purely artificial test of\r\nage or by the individual teacher's discretion. There is nothing to\r\nprevent the ambitious teacher or the ambitious parent from pushing a\r\nchild into kindergarten at four, high school at twelve, college at\r\nfifteen. If this cannot be done at the public school, a private school\r\nis resorted to. A community of college professors once started a school\r\nfor faculty children. A tremendous pressure was put upon these scions\r\nof intellectual aristocracy to enter the high school at twelve. No\r\nthought was given to the ventilation of the school. The windows were\r\nso arranged that they could not be opened without the air blowing on\r\nsome child's back. \"You could cut the air with a knife\" was a\r\ndescription given by one sensible professor who had taken his sturdy\r\ngirl of seven away from the school, because he feared that in this\r\nenvironment she would become like the other little puny, pale,\r\nundersized children of that school.\r\n\r\nThe University of Pennsylvania has instituted a psychological clinic.\r\nParents and teachers are invited to bring any deviation from the usual\r\nor the expected to the attention of this clinic. Every month a bulletin\r\nis published called the _Psychological Clinic_, which will be found of\r\ngreat service in dealing with the abnormally bright as well as with the\r\nabnormally dull. Naturally the well-to-do and the rich are the first to\r\ntake advantage of these special facilities for ascertaining just what\r\nwork should be done by a precocious child or by the mentally and\r\nmorally retarded.\r\n\r\nAbnormal brightness means power to be happy and to be serviceable that\r\nis above the average. Every school can be a miniature psychological\r\nclinic. While every teacher cannot be an expert, national and state\r\nsuperintendents can constantly remind teachers that the abnormally\r\nbright are also abnormally apt to neglect physical welfare and to\r\nendanger future mental power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNERVOUSNESS OF TEACHER AND PUPIL\r\n\r\n\r\nNervousness of teacher and pupil deserves special mention. So universal\r\nis this physical defect that we take it for granted, especially for\r\nteachers. Teachers themselves feel that they need not even apologize\r\nfor nervousness, in fact they too frequently use it as an excuse for\r\nimpatience, ugly temper, discourtesy, and unfairness. Children, slates,\r\npapers, parents, blackboards \"get on their nerves.\" Nervousness of\r\nteacher causes nervousness of pupils and adds to the evil results of\r\nmouth breathing, bad teeth, eye strain, and malnutrition. These\r\nconditions, added to bad ventilation, bad light, and an overcrowded\r\nschoolroom, render the atmosphere thoroughly charged with\r\nelectricity--nerves--toward the end of the day. Lack of oxygen to\r\nbreathe as well as inability to breathe it; lack of well-printed books\r\nand good light, as well as lack of the power to use them; toothache,\r\nearache, headache, deplete the vitality of both teacher and pupil.\r\n\r\nMost of the disturbances at school are but outward signs of unwholesome\r\nphysical conditions. If the teacher attempts to treat these causes by\r\ncrushing the child, she makes confession of her own nervousness and\r\ninadequacy and visits her own suffering upon her pupils. A transfixing\r\nglance prolonged into an overbearing stare, a loud, sharp voice, a\r\nrough manner, are successful only so far as they work on the\r\nnervousness of her pupil. She finds that it is temporarily effective,\r\nand so by her example and practice sets the child an example in losing\r\ncontrol of himself. The position often assumed by school children when\r\nbefore authority, of hands held stiffly at the side, head drooped, and\r\nroving eye, does not mean control: it means a crushed spirit,\r\nhypocrisy, or brooding anarchy. The mother or teacher who obtains\r\nobedience by clapping her hands, pointing her finger, distorting her\r\nface, is copying in her own home the attitudes of caste in India, of\r\nserfdom in Russia, the discipline of the prison the world over, a\r\nmodern reminder of the power of life and death or of physical torture.\r\n\r\nA young college girl unfamiliar with the ways of the public school was\r\nsubstituting in the highest grammar grade. The time for civics arrived.\r\nHere, she thought, is a subject in which I can interest them. The boys\r\nshowed a vast amount of press information, as well as decided opinions\r\non the politics of the day. The candidates which they elected for the\r\nposition of ideal American patriot were Rockefeller, Lincoln, and\r\nSharkey the prize fighter. During the ensuing debate, which gave back\r\nto Lincoln his proper rank, the boys in the back of the room had moved\r\nforward and were sharing seats with the boys in the front. Every boy\r\nwas engrossed in the discussion. The room was in perfect order,--not,\r\nhowever, according to the ideas of the principal, who entered at that\r\nmoment to see how the new substitute was managing the class, famed for\r\nits bad boys. With the stern look of a Simon Legree she demanded, \"How\r\ndare you leave your seats!\" When one child started to explain she\r\nshouted: \"How dare you speak without permission! Don't you know your\r\nteacher never permits it? Every boy take his own seat at his own desk.\"\r\nThis principal was far more to be pitied than the boys, for they had\r\nbefore them the prospect of \"work papers\" and a grind less monotonous\r\nand more productive than the principal's discipline. She was a victim\r\nof a nerve-racking system, more sinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in school life _per se_ to cause nervousness. Given a\r\nwell-aired, sunny room, where every child has enough fresh air to\r\nbreathe, where he can see without strain, where he has a desk fitted to\r\nhis body and work fitted to his maximum abilities, a teacher who is\r\nphysically strong and mentally inspiring, and plenty of play space and\r\nplay time, there will be no nervousness. One who visits vacation\r\nschools is struck with the difference in the atmosphere from that of\r\nthe winter day schools. Here are the same rooms, the same children, and\r\nin many cases the same teachers, but different work. Each child is busy\r\nwith a bright, interested, happy expression and easy attitude. Some are\r\nat nature study, some are weaving baskets, making dresses, trimming\r\nhats, knitting bright worsted sacks and mittens for the winter. Boys\r\nare at carpentering, raffia, or wrought-iron work. In none of the rooms\r\nis the absolute unity or the methodical order of the winter schoolroom,\r\nbut rather the hum of the workroom and the order that comes from a\r\nroomful of children interested in the progress of their work. This\r\ncondition only illustrates what a winter schoolroom might be were\r\nphysical defects corrected or segregated, windows open, light good, and\r\nwork adapted to the child.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VACATION SCHOOL INTEREST: AN ANTIDOTE TO\r\n    NERVOUSNESS]\r\n\r\nNervousness is not a monopoly of city teachers and city pupils. In\r\ncountry schools that I have happened to know, nervous children were the\r\nchief problem. Nervousness led in scholarship, in disorder, in\r\nabsences, in truancy, and in backwardness. After reading MacDonald's\r\n_Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood_, I became interested in one or two\r\nparticularly nervous children, just to see if I could overcome my\r\nstrong dislike for them. To one boy I gave permission to leave the room\r\nor to go to the library whenever he began to lose his self-control. My\r\npredecessors had not been able to control him by the rod. A few weeks\r\nafter Willie's emancipation from rules, the county superintendent was\r\nastonished to see that the county terror led my school in history,\r\nreading, and geography.\r\n\r\nHad I known what every teacher should be taught in preparation,--the\r\nrelation of eye strain, bad teeth, adenoids, \"overattention,\" and\r\nmalnutrition to nervousness and bad behavior,--I could have restored\r\nmany \"incorrigibles\" to nerve control. Had I been led at college to\r\nstudy child psychology and child physiology, I should not have expected\r\na control that was possible only in a normal adult.[6] In its primary\r\naspect the question of nervousness in the schoolroom is purely\r\nphysiological, and the majority of principals and teachers are not\r\ntrained by professional schools how to deal with it. Normal schools\r\nshould teach the physical laws which govern the child's development;\r\nshould show that the pupil's mental, moral, and physical nature are one\r\nand inseparable; that children cannot at one time be docile, sickly,\r\nand intelligent,--perfect mentally and imperfect physically. Until\r\nteachers are so taught, the condition cannot be changed that makes of\r\nour schools manufactories of nervous teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nCountry nervousness, like city nervousness, is of three kinds: (1) that\r\ncaused by defective nervous systems; (2) that resulting from physical\r\ndefects other than defects of the nervous system, but reacting upon it;\r\n(3) that due to habit or to lack of self-control. Children who suffer\r\nfrom a defective nervous system should, in city schools, be segregated\r\nwhere they can have special care under constant medical supervision.\r\nSuch children in schools too small for special classes should be given\r\nspecial treatment. Their parents should know that they have chorea,\r\nwhich is the same trouble as St. Vitus's Dance, although often existing\r\nin a degree too mild to attract attention. Special treatment does not\r\nmean that such children should be permitted to interfere with the\r\nschool progress of other children. In many rural schools, where special\r\nprivileges cannot be given children suffering with chorea without\r\ninjury to other children, it would be a kindness to the unfortunates,\r\nto their parents, and to all other children, were the parents requested\r\nto keep such children at home.\r\n\r\nNervousness that results from removable physical defects--eye strain,\r\nadenoids, indigestion, earache--will be easily detected by physical\r\nexamination, and easily corrected by removing the physical defect.\r\n\r\nPreventable nervousness due to \"habit\" can be quite as serious in its\r\neffects upon the mind and health as the other two forms of nervousness.\r\nTwitching the face, biting the nails, wetting the lips, blinking the\r\neyelids, continually toying with something, being in perpetual motion\r\nand never relaxing, always changing from one thing to the next, being\r\nforever on the rush, never accomplishing anything, are common faults of\r\nboth teacher and pupil. We call them mannerisms or tricks of\r\npersonality. They are readily imitated by children. I once knew a young\r\nlawyer who had started life as an oyster dealer, whose power of\r\nimitation helped to make him responsive to both helpful and harmful\r\ninfluences. After being at the same table for two weeks with a\r\ntalented man whom he admired, he acquired the latter's habit of\r\nconstantly twitching his shoulder and making certain gestures. These\r\nhabits in turn quickly produced a nervousness that interfered with his\r\npower to reason straight.\r\n\r\nNervousness is often confused with aggressiveness, initiative,\r\nconfidence. \"Think twice before you jump, and perhaps you won't want to\r\njump\" is a very difficult rule to follow for any one whose bodily\r\nmovements are not under perfect control.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the confusion of city life causes habits of\r\nnervousness. Unfortunately no one knows whether the city children or\r\nthe country children have the highest percentage of nervousness. There\r\nis a general feeling that city life causes an unwholesome degree of\r\nactivity, yet one finds that those people in the city who least notice\r\nthe elevated railway are those whose windows it passes. City noises\r\nirritate those who come from the country, or the city man on returning\r\nto the city from the country, but a similar irritation is felt by the\r\ncity-bred man on coming to the country. Mr. Dooley's description of a\r\nnight in the country with the crickets and the mosquitoes and the early\r\nbirds shows that it is the unusual noise rather than the volume or\r\nvariety of noises that wreck nerves. At the time of the opening of the\r\nNew York schools in 1907 a newspaper published an editorial on \"Where\r\ncan the city child study?\" showing that in New York the curriculum, the\r\nschoolhouse, and the tenements are so crowded and so noisy that study\r\nis practically impossible. Lack of sleep, lack of a quiet place in\r\nwhich to study at school and at home, are causes for nervousness,\r\nwhether these conditions are in the city or in the country. What\r\nevidence is there that the country curriculum is less crowded or\r\ncountry work better adjusted to the psychological and physiological age\r\nof the country pupil? The index is there; it should be read.\r\n\r\nIn breaking habits of nervousness the first step is to explain how\r\neasily habits are formed, why their effects may be serious, and how a\r\nlittle attention will correct them. When a habit loses its mystery it\r\nbecomes unattractive. Children will take an interest in cooeperating\r\nwith each other and with the teacher in curing habits acquired either\r\nat home or at school. My pupils greatly enjoyed overcoming the habit of\r\njumping or screaming after some sudden noise. I told them how, when a\r\nboy, my imagination had been very much impressed by one of Thackeray's\r\ncharacters, the last remnant of aristocratic traditions, almost a\r\npauper, but possessing one attribute of nobility,--absolute\r\nself-control. When his house burned he stood with his ankles crossed,\r\nleaning on his cane, the only onlooker who was not excited. For months\r\nI imitated that pose, using sticks and rakes and fork handles. The\r\nresult was that when I taught school, a scream, a broken desk, or\r\nunusual noise outside reminded me of my old aristocrat in time to\r\nprevent my muscles from jumping. In a very short time several fidgety\r\nand nervous girls and boys had learned to think twice and to relax\r\nbefore jumping.\r\n\r\nOne test of thorough relaxation in a dentist's chair proves the folly\r\nof tightening one's muscles. When in school or out the remedy for\r\nnervousness is relaxation. The discipline that prohibits a pupil from\r\nstretching or changing his posture or seat is as much to be condemned\r\nas that which flourishes the rod. It has been said of our schools that\r\nchildren are not worked to death but bored to death. Wherever a room\r\nmust be stripped of all beauty and interest to induce concentration,\r\nwherever the greater part of the teacher's time must be spent in\r\nkeeping order, there is confession either of inappropriateness of the\r\npresent curriculum or of the failure of teacher and text-book to\r\npresent subjects attractive to the pupils. Nervous habits will be\r\ninevitable until the pupil's attention is obtained through interest.\r\nSustained interest will be impossible until teacher and pupil alike\r\npractice relaxation, not once a morning or twice a day, not during\r\nrecess or lunch hour, but whenever relaxation is needed.\r\n\r\nIn overcoming nervousness of teacher and pupil, both must be interested\r\nin home causes as well as school causes of that nervousness. Time must\r\nbe found to ask questions about those causes and to discuss means for\r\nremoving them. Naturally it will be embarrassing for a very nervous\r\nteacher to discuss nervousness with children,--until after she has\r\novercome her own lack of nerve stability. To help her or to compel her\r\nto learn the art of relaxation of bodily and of mental control is the\r\nduty and the privilege of the school physician, of her doctor, and of\r\nsuperintendent and trustees. The outside point of view is necessary,\r\nbecause of the peculiar fact that almost every nervous person believes\r\nthat he has unusually good control over his nerves, just as a man in\r\nthe midst of his anger will declare that he is cool and\r\nself-controlled. Had Robert Burns been thinking of the habit of\r\nnervousness he could not have thought of a better cure than when he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    Oh wad some power the giftie gie us\r\n    To see oursel's as ithers see us;\r\n    It wad frae mony a blunder free us,\r\n      And foolish notion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] _The Unconscious Mind_ by Schofield, _The Study of Children and\r\ntheir School Training_ by Dr. Frances Warner, and _The Development of\r\nthe Child_ by Nathan Oppenheimer show clearly the physical and mental\r\nlimitations and possibilities of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHEALTH VALUE OF \"UNBOSSED\" PLAY AND PHYSICAL TRAINING\r\n\r\n\r\n_A boy without play means a father without a job. A boy without\r\nphysical training means a father who drinks. When people have\r\nwholesome, well-disciplined bodies there will be less demand for\r\nnarcotics as well as for medicines._ On these three propositions\r\nenthusiasm has built arguments for city parks and playgrounds, for\r\nschool gymnastics, and for temperance instruction. We have tried the\r\nremedies and now realize that too much was expected of them. Neither\r\nmovement appreciated the mental and physical education of spontaneous\r\ngames and play.\r\n\r\nLike hygiene instruction, physical training was made compulsory by law\r\nin many states, and, like hygiene instruction, physical training had to\r\nyield to the pressure of subjects in which children are examined. At\r\nthe outset both were based upon distorted psychology and physiology. Of\r\nlate physical training has been revived \"to correct defects of the\r\nschool desk and to relieve the strain of too prolonged study periods.\"\r\nIn New York grammar schools ten minutes a day for the lower grades, and\r\nthirty minutes a week for the higher grades, are set aside for physical\r\ntraining. With the exception of eighteen schools where apparatus is\r\nused, the exercise has been in the class rooms. It consists of what are\r\nknown as \"setting-up exercises,\"--deep breathing and arm movements for\r\ntwo minutes between each study period, often forgotten until it is time\r\nto go home, when the children are tired and need it least. Many\r\nteachers so conduct these exercises that children keenly enjoy them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SERVICEABLE RELIEF FROM SCHOOL STRAIN, BUT A POOR\r\n    SUBSTITUTE FOR OUTDOOR PLAY]\r\n\r\nLike hygiene instruction, physical training preceded physical\r\nexamination. Generally speaking, it has not yet, either in schools or\r\nin colleges, been related to physical needs of the individual pupil. In\r\nfact, there is no guarantee that it is not in many schools working a\r\npositive injury on defective children or imposing a defective\r\nenvironment on healthy children. Formal exercises in cramped space, in\r\nill-ventilated rooms, with tight belts and heavy shoes, are conceded to\r\nbe pernicious. Formal exercises should never be given to any child\r\nwithout examination and prescription by a physician. Children with\r\nheart weakness, enlarged tonsils, adenoid growths, spinal curvature,\r\nuneven shoulders, are frequently seen doing exercises for which they\r\nare physically unfit, and which but serve to deplete further their\r\nalready low vitality. Attention might be called to many a class engaged\r\nin breathing exercises when by actual count over half the boys were\r\nholding their mouths open. Special exercises are needed by children who\r\nshow some marked defect like flat foot, flat chest, weak abdominal\r\nmuscles, habitual constipation, uneven shoulders, spinal trouble, etc.\r\n\r\nThat no physical training should be provided for normal children is the\r\nbelief of many leading trainers. This special training is useful to\r\ndevelop athletes or to correct defects. Like massage, osteopathy, or\r\nmedicine, it should follow careful diagnosis. The time is coming when\r\nformal indoor gymnasium exercises for normal pupils or normal students\r\nwill be considered an anomaly. There is all the difference in the world\r\nbetween physical development and what is called physical training. The\r\ntest of physical development is not the hours spent upon a prescribed\r\ncourse of training, but the physical condition determined by\r\nexamination. To be refused permission to substitute an hour's walk for\r\nan hour's indoor apparatus work is often an outrage upon health laws.\r\nGiven a normal healthy body, plenty of space, and plenty of playtime,\r\nthe spontaneous exercise which a child naturally chooses is what is\r\nreally health sustaining and health giving.\r\n\r\nMere muscular development artificially obtained through the devices of\r\na gymnasium is inferior to the mental and moral development produced by\r\ngames and play in the open air. Eustace Miles, M.D., amateur tennis\r\nplayer of England, says:\r\n\r\n  I do not consider a mere athlete to be a really healthy man. He\r\n  has no more right to be called a really healthy man than the\r\n  foundations or scaffolding of a house have a right to be called a\r\n  house. They become a good house, and, indeed, they are\r\n  indispensable to a good house, but at present the good house\r\n  exists only in potentiality.\r\n\r\nThe \"healthy-mindedness\" and \"physical morality\" which play and games\r\nfoster rarely result from physical training as a business, at stated\r\ntimes, indoors, under class direction. It is too much like taking\r\nmedicine. A certain breakfast food is said to have lost much of its\r\npopularity since advertised as a health food. When the National\r\nPlayground Association was organized President Roosevelt cautioned its\r\nofficers against too frequent use of the word \"supervision\" on the\r\nground that supervision and direction were apt to defeat the very\r\npurpose of games and to stultify the play spirit. Is the little girl on\r\nthe street who springs into a hornpipe or a jig to the tune of a\r\nhurdy-gurdy, or even the boy who runs before automobiles or trolley\r\ncars or under horses' noses, getting less physical education than those\r\nwho play a round game in silence under the supervision of a teacher in\r\nthe school basement, or who stretch their arms up and down to the tune\r\nof one, two, three, four, five, six? Who can doubt that the much-pitied\r\nchild of the tenement playing with the contents of the ash can in the\r\nclothes yard or with baby brother on the fire escape is developing more\r\noriginality, more lung power, and better arteries than the child of\r\nfortune who is led by the hand of a governess up and down Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nChildren have not forgotten how to play, but adults have forgotten to\r\nleave space in cities, and time out of school, home work, and factory\r\nwork in which children may play. Again, the child--whether a city child\r\nor a country child--rarely needs to be taught how to play. Teaching him\r\ngames will not produce vitality. Games are the spontaneous product of a\r\nhealthy body, active mind, and a joy in living. Give the children parks\r\nand piers, roof gardens and playgrounds in which they may play, and\r\nleave the rest to them. Give them time away from school and housework,\r\nand leave the rest to them. Instead of lamenting the necessity for\r\nplaying in the streets, let us reserve more streets for children's\r\nplay. There are too many students of child welfare whose reasoning\r\nabout play and games is like that of a lady of Cincinnati, who, upon\r\nreading the notice of a child-labor meeting, said: \"Well, I am glad to\r\nsee there is going to be a meeting here for child labor. It is high\r\ntime some measure was taken to keep the children off the streets.\"\r\nPhysical examinations would prove that streets are safer and better\r\nthan indoor gymnasiums for growing children. Intelligent physical\r\ntraining will train children to go out of doors during recess; will\r\ntrain pupils and teachers not to use recess for study, discipline, or\r\neating lunch.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPONTANEOUS PLAY ON ONE OF NEW YORK CITY'S SCHOOL\r\n    ROOF PLAYGROUNDS]\r\n\r\n\"After-school\" conditions are quite as important as physical training\r\nand gymnastics at school. Not long ago a nurse was visiting a sick\r\ntenement mother with a young baby. She found a little girl of twelve\r\nstanding on a stool over a washtub. This child did all the housework,\r\ntook care of the mother and two younger children, got all the meals\r\nexcept supper, which her father got on his return from work. As the\r\nnurse removed the infant's clothes to give it a bath, the little girl\r\nseized them and dashed them into the tub. \"Yes, I am pretty tired when\r\nnight comes,\" she confessed. This child has prototypes in the country\r\nas well as the city, and she did not need physical training. She did\r\nnot lack initiative or originality. She did need playmates, open air, a\r\nrun in the park, and \"fun.\"\r\n\r\nThe educational value of games and outdoor play should be weighed\r\nagainst the advantages of lowering the compulsory school age, and of\r\nbridging over the period from four to seven with indoor kindergarten\r\ntraining. Neither physical training nor education is synonymous with\r\nconfinement in school. The whole tendency of Nature's processes in\r\nchildren is nutritional; it is not until adolescence that she makes\r\nmuch effort to develop the brain. Overuse of the young mind results,\r\ntherefore, in diverting natural energy from nutritive processes to\r\nhurried growth of the overstimulated brain. The result is a type of\r\nchild with a puny body and an excitable brain,--the neurotic. The young\r\neye, for example, is too flat (hypermetropic)--made to focus only on\r\nobjects at a distance. Close application to print, or even to weaving\r\nmats or folding bits of paper accurately, causes an overstrain on the\r\neye, which not only results in the chronic condition known as\r\nmyopia,--short-sightedness,--so common to school children, but which\r\nacts unfavorably on the constitution and on the whole development of\r\nthe child. At the recent International Congress of School Hygiene in\r\nLondon, Dr. Arthur Newsholme, medical officer of health of Brighton,\r\nmade a plea for the exclusion of children under five years of age from\r\nschools. \"During the time the child is in the infant department it has\r\nchiefly to grow. Nutrition and sleep are its chief functions. Paints,\r\npencils, paper, pins, and needles should not be handled in school by\r\nchildren below six.\" Luther Burbank, in an article on \"The Training of\r\nthe Human Plant,\" says:\r\n\r\n  The curse of modern child life in America is overeducation,\r\n  overconfinement, overrestraint. The injury wrought to the race by\r\n  keeping too young children in school is beyond the power of any\r\n  one to estimate. The work of breaking down the nervous systems of\r\n  the children of the United States is now well under way. Every\r\n  child should have mud pies, grasshoppers, and tad-poles, wild\r\n  strawberries, acorns, and pine cones, trees to climb and brooks\r\n  to wade in, sand, snakes, huckleberries, and hornets, and any\r\n  child who has been deprived of these has been deprived of the best\r\n  part of his education.\r\n\r\nNot every child can have these blessings of the country, but every\r\nchild can be protected from the stifling of the nature instinct of play\r\nby formal indoor \"bossed\" exercises, whether called games, physical\r\ntraining, gymnastics, or Delsarte.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEW YORK CITY'S SCHOOL FARM DOES NOT STIFLE\r\n    NATURE INSTINCT]\r\n\r\nThe answer to the protest against too early and too constant\r\nconfinement in school has always been: \"Where will the child be if out\r\nof school? Will its environment at home not work a worse injury to its\r\nhealth? Will not the street injure its morals?\" Because we have not yet\r\nworked out a method of supervising the health of those children who are\r\nnot in school, it does not follow that such supervision is impossible.\r\nPerhaps the time will come when there will be state supervision over\r\nthe health of children from birth, parents being expected to present\r\nthem once a year at school for examination by the school physician. In\r\nthis way defects can be corrected and health measures devised to build\r\nup a physique that should not break down under the strain of school\r\nlife. For children whose mothers work during the day, and for those\r\nwhose home environment is worse than school, it might be cheaper in the\r\nlong run to assign teachers to protect them from injury while they play\r\nin a park, roof garden, or out-of-door gymnasium. If parks and\r\nplaygrounds come too slowly, why not adopt the plan advocated by Alida\r\nS. Williams, a New York principal, of reserving certain streets for\r\nchildren between the hours of three and five, and of diverting traffic\r\nto other streets less suitable for children's play? So great is the\r\nvalue--mentally, morally, and physically--of out-of-door play that it\r\nhas even been suggested that the substitution of such play for school\r\nfor all children up to the age of ten would insure better minds and\r\nsounder physiques at fifteen. It is generally admitted that the child\r\nwho enters school at eight rather than at six will be the gainer at\r\ntwelve. What a travesty upon education to insist upon schooling for\r\nchildren because they are apt to be run over on the street, or to be\r\nneglected at home, to shoot craps, or belong to a gang and develop bad\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\nEducators will some day be ashamed to have made the schools the\r\ncatch-all or the court-plaster for the evils of modern industry.\r\nInstead of pupils and mothers going to the school, enough hygiene\r\nteachers, and play teachers, and district physicians could be employed\r\nwith the money now spent on indoor instruction to do the house-to-house\r\nvisiting urged in many chapters of this book. Such a course of action\r\nwould have an incalculable effect on the reduction of tuberculosis, not\r\nonly in making healthier physiques but by inculcating habits of outdoor\r\nlife and love of fresh air. The danger of those contagious diseases\r\nwhich ravish childhood would be greatly reduced. An ambition for\r\nphysical integrity would make unnatural living unpopular. Competition\r\nin games with children _of the same physical class_ develops accuracy,\r\nconcentration, dispatch, resourcefulness, as much as does instruction\r\nin arithmetic. Smoking can easily be discredited among boys trying to\r\nhit the bull's-eye. A boy would sooner give up a glass of beer than the\r\nchampionship in rifle shooting or a \"home run.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of the \"spirit of the game\" on practical life has been\r\ndescribed thus by New York's director of physical training, Dr. Luther\r\nH. Gulick:\r\n\r\n  Play is the spontaneous enlistment of the entire personality in\r\n  the pursuit of some coveted end. We do not have to pursue the\r\n  goal; we wish to--it is our main desire. This is the way in which\r\n  greatest discoveries, fortunes, and poems are made. It is the way\r\n  in which we take the responsibilities and problems of life that\r\n  makes it either a deadly bore--a mere dull round of routine and\r\n  drudgery--or the most interesting and absorbing game, capable of\r\n  enlisting all the energy and enthusiasm we have to put into it.\r\n  The people who accomplish things are the people who play the game.\r\n  They let themselves go; they are not afraid. Under the stimulus\r\n  and enthusiasm of play muscles contract more powerfully and longer\r\n  than under other conditions. Blood pressure is higher in play. It\r\n  is far more interesting to play the game than to work at it. When\r\n  you work you are being driven, when you play you are doing the\r\n  driving yourself. We play not by jumping the traces of life's\r\n  responsibilities, but by going so far beyond life's compulsions as\r\n  to lose sight of the compulsion element. Play up, play up, and\r\n  play the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nVITALITY TESTS AND VITAL STATISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo things will disclose the strength or weakness of a bank and the\r\nsoundness or unsoundness of a nation's banking policy, namely, a\r\nfinancial crisis or an expert audit. A searching audit that analyzes\r\neach debit and each credit frequently shows that a bank is solvent only\r\nbecause it is not asked to pay its debts. It continues to do business\r\nso long as no obvious weaknesses appear, analogous to measles,\r\nadenoids, or paralysis. A frequent disorder of banking results from\r\ndoing too big a business on too little capital, in making too many\r\nloans for the amount of cash held ready to pay depositors upon demand.\r\nThis disorder always comes to light in a crisis--too late. It can be\r\ndiscovered if looked for in advance of a crisis. Many individuals and\r\ncommunities are likewise physically solvent only because their physical\r\nresources are not put to the test. Weaknesses that lie near the surface\r\ncan be discovered before a crisis by physical examination for\r\nindividuals and sanitary supervision for communities. Whether\r\nindividuals or communities are trying to do too much business for their\r\nhealth capital, whether the health reserves will pay debts that arise\r\nin a crisis, whether we are ill or well prepared to stand a run on our\r\nvitality, can be learned only by carefully analyzing our health\r\nreserves. Health debits are compared with health credits for\r\nindividuals by vitality tests, for communities by vital statistics.\r\n\r\nOf the many vitality tests none is practicable for use in the ordinary\r\nclass room. Scientific training is just as necessary for such tests as\r\nfor discovering the quality of the blood, the presence or absence of\r\ntubercle bacilli in the sputum, diphtheria germs in throat mucus, or\r\ntyphoid germs in milk. But scientific truth, the results of scientific\r\ntests, can be made of everyday use in all class rooms. State and\r\nnational headquarters for educators, and all large cities, can afford\r\nto engage scientists to apply vitality tests to school children for the\r\nsake of discovering, in advance of physical breakdown and before\r\noutward symptoms are obvious, what curriculum, what exercise, what\r\nstudy, recreation, and play periods are best suited to child\r\ndevelopment. It will cost infinitely less to proceed this way than to\r\nneglect children or to fit school methods to the loudest, most\r\npersistent theory.\r\n\r\nThe ergograph is an interesting strength tester. It takes a picture (1)\r\nof the energy exerted, and (2) of the regularity or fitfulness of the\r\nmanner in which energy is exerted. Perhaps the time will come when\r\nscience and commerce will supply every tintype photographer with an\r\nergograph and the knowledge to use it. Then we shall hear at summer\r\nresorts and fairs, \"Your ergograph on a postal card, three for a\r\nquarter.\" We can step inside, harness our middle finger to the\r\nergograph, lift it up and down forty-five times in ninety seconds, and\r\nlo! a photograph of our vitality! If we have strong muscles or good\r\ncontrol, the picture will be like this:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Ergogram of T.R., a strong, healthy girl,\r\n    before taking 40 minutes' work in the gymnasium. Weight used,\r\n    3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 151 cm. Work done, 528.5 kg.-cm.]\r\n\r\nIf weak and nervous, we shall look like this before taking exercise:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Ergogram of C.E., a weak and somewhat\r\n    nervous girl, before taking 40 minutes' work in the gymnasium.\r\n    Weight used, 3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 89 cm. Work done, 311.5\r\n    kg.-cm.]\r\n\r\nAnd like this after gymnasium exercise:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Ergogram of C.E. after taking 40 minutes'\r\n    work in the gymnasium, showing that the exercise proved very\r\n    exhausting. Weight used, 3.5 kg. Distance lifted, 55 cm.]\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, two of whose girls are above photographed, the physician\r\nwas surprised to have four pupils show more strength late in the day\r\nthan in the morning. \"Upon investigation it was found that the teacher\r\nof the four pupils had been called from school, and that they had no\r\nregular work, but had been sent to another room and employed\r\nthemselves, as they said, in having a good time.\" The chart on page 127\r\nshows the effect of the noon recess and of the good time after three\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nChicago's child-study experts concluded after examining a large number\r\nof children:\r\n\r\n  1. In general there is a distinct relationship in children between\r\n  physical condition and intellectual capacity, the latter varying\r\n  directly as the former.\r\n\r\n  2. The endurance (ergographic work) of boys is greater than that\r\n  of girls at all ages, and the difference seems to increase after\r\n  the age of nine.\r\n\r\n  3. There are certain anthropometric (body measurements)\r\n  indications which warrant a careful and thorough investigation\r\n  into the subject of coeducation in the upper grammar grades.\r\n\r\n  4. Physical condition should be made a factor in the grading of\r\n  children for school work, and especially for entrance into the\r\n  first grade.\r\n\r\n  5. The great extremes in the physical condition of pupils in the\r\n  upper grammar grades make it desirable to introduce great\r\n  elasticity into the work of these grades.\r\n\r\n  6. The classes in physical culture should be graded on a physical\r\n  instead of an intellectual basis.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nTo these conclusions certain others should be added, not as settled\r\nbeyond any possibility of modification, but as being fairly indicated\r\nby these tests.\r\n\r\n  1. The pubescent period is characterized by great and rapid\r\n  changes in height, weight, strength of grip, vital capacity, and\r\n  endurance. There seems to accompany this physical activity a\r\n  corresponding intellectual and emotional activity. It therefore is\r\n  a period when broad educational influences are most needed. From\r\n  the pedagogic standpoint it is preeminently a time for character\r\n  building.\r\n\r\n  2. The pubescent period is characterized by extensive range of all\r\n  physical features of the individuals in it. Hence, although a\r\n  period fit for great activity of the mass of children, it is also\r\n  one of numerous individual exceptions to this general law. During\r\n  this period a greater per cent of individuals than usual pass\r\n  beyond the range of normal limits set by the mass. It is a time,\r\n  therefore, when the weak fail and the able forge to the front, and\r\n  hence calls for a higher degree than usual of individualization of\r\n  educational work and influence.\r\n\r\n  3. Unidexterity is a normal condition. Rapid and marked\r\n  accentuation of unidexterity is a pubescent change. On the whole,\r\n  there is a direct relationship between the degree of unidexterity\r\n  and the intellectual progress of the pupil. At any given age of\r\n  school life bright or advanced pupils tend toward accentuated\r\n  unidexterity, and dull or backward pupils tend toward\r\n  ambidexterity.... Training in ambidexterity is training contrary\r\n  to a law of child life.\r\n\r\n  4. Boys of school age at the Bridewell (reform school) are\r\n  inferior in all physical measurements to boys in the ordinary\r\n  schools, and this inferiority seems to increase with age.\r\n\r\n  5. Defects of sight and hearing are more numerous among the dull\r\n  and backward pupils. These defects should be taken into\r\n  consideration in the seating of pupils. Only by removing the\r\n  defects can the best advancement be secured.\r\n\r\n  6. The number of eye and ear defects increases during the first\r\n  years of school life. The causes of this increase should be\r\n  investigated, and, as far as possible, removed.\r\n\r\n  7. There are certain parts of the school day when pupils, on the\r\n  average, have a higher storage of energy than at other periods.\r\n  These periods should be utilized for the highest forms of\r\n  educational work.\r\n\r\n  8. The stature of boys is greater than that of girls up to the age\r\n  of eleven, when the girls surpass the boys and remain greater in\r\n  stature up to the age of fourteen. After fourteen, girls increase\r\n  in stature very slowly and very slightly, while boys continue to\r\n  increase rapidly until eighteen.\r\n\r\n  9. The weight of the girl surpasses that of the boy about a year\r\n  later than her stature surpasses his, and she maintains her\r\n  superiority in weight to a later period of time than she maintains\r\n  her superiority in height.\r\n\r\n  10. In height, sitting, girls surpass boys at the same age as in\r\n  stature, namely, eleven years, but they maintain their superiority\r\n  in this measurement for one year longer than they do in stature,\r\n  which indicates that the more rapid growth of the boy at this age\r\n  is in the lower extremities rather than in the trunk.\r\n\r\n  11. Commencing at the age of thirteen, strength of grip in boys\r\n  shows a marked accentuation in its rate of increase, and this\r\n  increase continues as far as our observations extend, namely, to\r\n  the age of twenty. In girls no such great acceleration in muscular\r\n  strength at puberty occurs, and after sixteen there is little\r\n  increase in strength of grip. The well-known muscular\r\n  differentiation of the sexes practically begins at thirteen.\r\n\r\n  12. As with strength of grip, so with endurance as measured by the\r\n  ergograph; boys surpass girls at all ages, and this\r\n  differentiation becomes very marked after the age of fourteen,\r\n  after which age girls increase in strength and endurance but very\r\n  slightly, while after fourteen boys acquire almost exactly half of\r\n  the total power in these two features which they acquire in the\r\n  first twenty years of life.\r\n\r\n  13. The development of vital capacity bears a striking resemblance\r\n  to that of endurance, the curves representing the two being almost\r\n  identical.\r\n\r\nPhysiological age, according to studies made in New York City, should\r\nbe considered in grading, not only for physical culture classes but for\r\nall high school or continuation classes. Dr. C. Ward Crampton,\r\nassistant physical director, while examining boys in the first grade of\r\nthe High School of Commerce, noticed a greater variation in physical\r\nadvancement than in years. He kept careful watch of the educational\r\nprogress and discovered three clear divisions: (1) boys arrived at\r\npuberty,--postpubescent; (2) boys approaching maturity,--pubescent; (3)\r\nboys not yet approaching maturity,--prepubescent.\r\n\r\nThe work in lower grades they had all passed satisfactorily, but in\r\nhigh school only the most advanced class did well. Practically none of\r\nthe not-yet-maturing boys survived and few of the almost mature. In\r\nother words, the high school course was fitted to only one of the three\r\nclasses of boys turned out of the grammar schools. The others succumbed\r\nlike hothouse azaleas at Christmas time, forced beyond their season.\r\nPhysiological age, not calendar years or grammar school months, should\r\ndetermine the studies and the companions of children after the tenth\r\nyear. Physiological strength and vitality, not ability to spell or to\r\nremember dates, should be the basis of grading for play and study and\r\ncompanionship among younger children. Vitality, power to endure\r\nphysically, should be the test of work and recreation for adults.\r\nPhysicians may be so trained to follow directions issued by experts\r\nthat physical examinations will disclose the chief enemies of vitality\r\nand the approximate limits of endurance.\r\n\r\nTeachers may train themselves to recognize signs of fatigue in school\r\nchildren and to adapt each day's, each hour's work to the endurance of\r\neach pupil. One woman principal has written:\r\n\r\n  School programmes, after they have been based upon the laws of a\r\n  child's development, should provide for frequent change of\r\n  subject, alternating studies requiring mental concentration with\r\n  studies permitting motor activity, and arranging for very short\r\n  periods of the former. Anaemic children should be relieved of all\r\n  anxiety as to the results of their efforts, and only short hours\r\n  of daylight work required of them. The disastrous consequences of\r\n  eye strain should be understood by all in charge of children who\r\n  are naturally hypermetropic. The ventilation of a class room is\r\n  far more important than its decoration or even than a high average\r\n  percentage in mathematics, and the lack of pure air is one of the\r\n  auxiliary causes of nervous exhaustion in both pupils and\r\n  teachers. Deficient motor control is a most trustworthy indication\r\n  of fatigue in children, and teachers may safely use it as a rough\r\n  index of the amount of effort to be reasonably expected of their\r\n  pupils. Facial pallor or feverish flushes are both evidences of\r\n  overtasking, and either hints that fatigue has already begun. As\r\n  to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, the teacher herself will\r\n  undoubtedly realize them as soon as the children, but she should\r\n  remember that effort carried to the point of exhaustion, injurious\r\n  as it is in an adult, is yet less harmful than it is to the\r\n  developing nerve centers of the child.\r\n\r\nBecause adults at work and at play reluctantly submit themselves to\r\nvitality tests, because few scientists are beseeching individuals to be\r\ntested, because almost no one yearns to be tested, the promotion of\r\nadult vitality and of community vitality can best be hastened by\r\ndemanding complete vital statistics. Industrial insurance companies and\r\nmutual benefit societies are doing much to educate laborers regarding\r\nthe effect upon vitality of certain dangerous and unsanitary trades,\r\nand of certain unhygienic habits, such as alcoholism and nicotinism.\r\nProgress is slower than it need be because state boards of health are\r\nnot gathering sufficiently complete information about causes of\r\nsickness and death. American health and factory inspection is not even\r\nprofiting, as it should, from British, German, and French statistics.\r\nStatistics are in ill repute because the truth is not generally known\r\nthat our boasted sanitary improvements are due chiefly to the efficient\r\nuse of vital statistics by statesmen sanitarians.[7]\r\n\r\nThe vital statistics of greatest consequence are not the number of\r\ndeaths or the number of births, not even the number of deaths from\r\npreventable diseases, but rather the number of cases of sickness from\r\ntransmissible diseases. The cost and danger to society from preventable\r\ndiseases, such as typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, are\r\nimperfectly represented by the number of deaths. Medical skill could\r\ngradually reduce death rates in the face of increasing prevalence of\r\ninfectious disease. With few exceptions, only those patients who refuse\r\nto follow instructions will die of measles, diphtheria, or smallpox.\r\nThe scarlet-fever patient who recovers and goes to church or school\r\nwhile \"peeling\" can cause vastly more sickness from scarlet fever than\r\na patient who dies. Dr. W. Leslie Mackenzie, who has recently written\r\n_The Health of the School Child_, said ten years ago, while health\r\nofficer of Leith:\r\n\r\n  Death is the ultimate and most severe injury that any disease can\r\n  inflict, but short of death there may be disablement, permanent or\r\n  temporary, loss of wages, loss of employment, loss of education,\r\n  increase of home labor, increase of sickness outlays, increase of\r\n  worry, anxiety and annoyance, disorganization of the household,\r\n  general impairment of social efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe best guarantee against such loss, the best protection of health,\r\nand the most essential element of vital statistics is prompt, complete\r\nrecord of cases of sickness. Statistics of sickness are confined to\r\nsickness from transmissible diseases, because we have not yet arrived\r\nat the point where we recognize the state's right to require\r\ninformation, except when the sick person is a menace to the health of\r\nother persons.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of a board of health should give as clear a picture\r\nof a community's health during the past week or past quarter as the\r\nergograph gives of the pupils mentioned on page 126. As ragged, rapidly\r\nshortening lines show nervousness and depleted vitality, so charts and\r\ndiagrams can be made to show the needless waste of infant life during\r\nthe summer months, the price paid for bad ventilation in winter time,\r\nwhen closed windows cause the sickness-and-death line from diphtheria\r\nand scarlet fever to shoot up from the summer level. In cities it is\r\nnow customary for health boards to report weekly the number of deaths\r\nfrom transmissible diseases. Health officers will gladly furnish facts\r\nas to cases of sickness, if citizens request them. Newspapers will\r\ngladly publish such information if any one will take the pains to\r\nsupply it. Wherever newspapers have published this information, it\r\nquickly takes its place with the weather reports among the news\r\nnecessities. Marked changes are commented on editorially. Children can\r\neasily be interested, as can adults, in filling out week by week a\r\ntable that will show increases and decreases in preventable sickness\r\ndue to transmissible diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE X\r\n\r\nCASES OF INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES REPORTED\r\n\r\n=================+================================================\r\n                 |                         WEEK ENDING\r\n                 +------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                 | Oct. | Nov. | Nov. | Nov. | Nov. | Nov. | Dec.\r\n                 |  26  |  2   |  9   |  16  |  23  |  30  |  7\r\n-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\nTuberculosis     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  pulmonalis     | 350  | 350  | 317  | 364  | 345  | 337  | 422\r\nDiphtheria and   |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  croup          | 313  | 264  | 283  | 331  | 282  | 343  | 326\r\nMeasles          | 142  | 212  | 203  | 261  | 293  | 323  | 472\r\nScarlet fever    | 208  | 228  | 231  | 252  | 278  | 323  | 372\r\nSmallpox         |  --  |   1  |  --  |   1  |  --  |  --  |   2\r\nVaricella        |  40  |  83  |  91  | 162  | 136  | 115  | 167\r\nTyphoid fever    | 106  | 105  | 107  | 123  |  86  |  77  |  71\r\nWhooping cough   |   6  |  13  |  15  |  14  |  27  |   9  |   8\r\nCerebro-spinal   |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  meningitis     |   6  |  11  |   3  |   4  |   4  |   8  |  15\r\n-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\nTotal            | 1171 | 1267 | 1250 | 1512 | 1451 | 1535 | 1855\r\n=================+======+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n\r\n=================+=========================================\r\n                 |             WEEK ENDING\r\n                 +------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                 | Dec. | Dec. | Dec. | Jan. | Jan. | Jan.\r\n                 |  14  |  21  |  28  |  4   |  11  |  18\r\n-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\nTuberculosis     |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  pulmonalis     | 360  | 354  | 308  | 344  | 432  | 402\r\nDiphtheria and   |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  croup          | 369  | 338  | 347  | 308  | 370  | 406\r\nMeasles          | 471  | 517  | 346  | 581  | 691  | 803\r\nScarlet fever    | 397  | 417  | 426  | 478  | 562  | 585\r\nSmallpox         |   4  |   3  |   2  |  --  |   2  |  --\r\nVaricella        | 160  | 198  | 123  |  98  | 199  | 169\r\nTyphoid fever    |  62  |  35  |  42  |  37  |  55  |  36\r\nWhooping cough   |  12  |  19  |   3  |  25  |  24  |  14\r\nCerebro-spinal   |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  meningitis     |  13  |   7  |   6  |  11  |  16  |  13\r\n-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\nTotal            | 1844 | 1888 | 1603 | 1882 | 2351 | 2428\r\n=================+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n\r\nIn cities where physicians are not compelled to notify the health board\r\nof danger centers,--that is, of patients sick from measles, smallpox,\r\nor diphtheria,--and in smaller communities where notices are sent only\r\nto state boards of health, parents will find it difficult to take a\r\nkeen interest in vital statistics. But if teachers would start at the\r\nbeginning of the year to record in such a table the days of absence\r\nfrom school because of transmissible disease, both they and their\r\npupils would discover a new interest in efficient health\r\nadministration. After a national board of health is organized we may\r\nreasonably expect that either state boards of education or state boards\r\nof health will regularly supply teachers with reports that will lead\r\nthem to compare the vitality photographs of their own schools and\r\ncommunities with the vitality photographs of other schools and other\r\ncommunities working under similar conditions. Then children old enough\r\nto study physiology and hygiene will be made to see the\r\nhappiness-giving possibilities of vitality tests and vital statistics.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VITAL STATISTICS CAN MAKE DISEASE CENTERS AS\r\n    OBVIOUS AND AS OFFENSIVE AS THE SMOKE NUISANCE]\r\n\r\nInstead of discussing the theory of vital statistics, or the extent to\r\nwhich statistics are now satisfactory, it would be better for us at\r\nthis point to make clear the significance of the movement for a\r\nnational fact center for matters pertaining to personal, industrial,\r\nand community vitality. Five economic reasons are assigned for\r\nestablishing a national department of health:\r\n\r\n  1. To enable society to increase the percentage of exceptional men\r\n  of each degree, many of whom are now lost through preventable\r\n  accidents, and also to increase the total population.\r\n\r\n  2. To lessen the burden of unproductive years by increasing the\r\n  average age at death.\r\n\r\n  3. To decrease the burden of death on the productive years by\r\n  increasing the age at death.\r\n\r\n  4. To lessen the cost of sickness. It is estimated that if illness\r\n  in the United States could be reduced one third, nearly\r\n  $500,000,000 would be saved annually.\r\n\r\n  5. To decrease the amounts spent on criminality that can be traced\r\n  to overcrowded, unwholesome, and unhygienic environment.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the economic gain, the establishment of a national\r\n  department of health would gradually but surely diminish much of\r\n  the misery and suffering that cannot be measured by statistics.\r\n  Sickness is a radiating center of anxiety; and often death in the\r\n  prime of life closes the gates of happiness on more than one life.\r\n  Let us not forget that the \"bitter cry of the children\" still goes\r\n  up to heaven, and that civilization must hear, until at last it\r\n  heeds, the imprecations of forever wasted years of millions of\r\n  lives.\r\n\r\n  If progress is to be real and lasting, it must provide whatever\r\n  bulwarks it can against death, sickness, misery, and ignorance;\r\n  and in an organization such as a national department of health,\r\n  adequately equipped,--a vast preventive machine working\r\n  ceaselessly,--an attempt at least would be made to stanch those\r\n  prodigal wastes of an old yet wastrel world.\r\n\r\nAmong the branches of the work proposed for the national bureau are the\r\nfollowing: infant hygiene; health education in schools; sanitation;\r\npure food; registration of physicians and surgeons; registration of\r\ndrugs, druggists, and drug manufacturers; registration of institutions\r\nof public and private relief, correction, detention and residence;\r\norganic diseases; quarantine; immigration; labor conditions;\r\ndisseminating health information; research libraries and equipment;\r\nstatistical clearing house for information.\r\n\r\nGiven such a national center for health facts or vital statistics,\r\nthere will be a continuing pressure upon state, county, and city health\r\nofficers, upon physicians, hospitals, schools, and industries to report\r\npromptly facts of birth, sickness, and death to national and state\r\ncenters able and eager to interpret the meaning of these facts in such\r\nsimple language, and with such convincing illustrations, that the\r\nreading public will demand the prompt correction of preventable evils.\r\n\r\nOur tardiness in establishing a national board of health that shall do\r\nthis great educational work is due in part to the fact that American\r\nsanitarians have frequently chosen to _do things_ when they should have\r\nchosen to _get things done_. Almost every state has its board of\r\nhealth, with authority to require registration of births, deaths, and\r\nsickness due to transmissible disease; with few exceptions the heads of\r\nthese state boards have spent their energies in abating nuisances. In a\r\nshort time they have degenerated into local scavengers, because they\r\nhave shown the public neither the meaning of the vital statistics\r\ngathered nor its duty to support efficient health administration.\r\n\r\nThe state reports of vital statistics have not been accurate; therefore\r\nin many states we have the anomalous situation of an aggressive\r\nveterinary board arousing the farmer and the consumer of milk to the\r\nnecessity of protecting the health of cattle, and an inactive,\r\nuninformed state board of health failing to protect the health of the\r\nfarmer and the consumer.\r\n\r\nVital statistics presume efficient health administration. An\r\ninefficient health officer will not take the initiative in gathering\r\nhealth statistics. If some one else compels him to collect vital\r\nstatistics, or furnishes him with statistics, they are as a lantern to\r\na blind man. Unless some one also compels him to make use of them,\r\nunless we remove the causes of transmissible or infectious diseases and\r\ncheck an epidemic when we first hear of it, the collection of\r\ninformation is of little social value. \"Statistics\" is of the same\r\nderivation as \"states\" and \"statesmen.\" Statistics have always been\r\ndistinguished from mere facts, in that statistics are instruments in\r\nthe hands of the statesman. Wherever the term \"statistics\" is applied\r\nto social facts it suggests action, social control of future\r\ncontingencies, mastery of the facts whose action they chronicle. The\r\nobject of gathering social facts for analysis is not to furnish\r\nmaterial for future historians. They are to be used in shaping future\r\nhistory. They are facts collected with a view to improving social\r\nvitality, to raising the standard of life, and to eliminating\r\npermanently those forces known to be destructive to health. Unless they\r\nare to be used this way, they are of interest only to the historical\r\ngrub. No city or state can afford to erect a statistical office to\r\nserve as a curiosity shop. Unless something is to be done to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of preventable diseases annually experienced by your\r\ncommunity or your school, it is not reasonable to ask the public\r\nprinter to make tables which indicate the great cost of this\r\npreventable sickness. A tax collector cannot discharge his duties\r\nunless he knows the address of every debtor. The police bureau cannot\r\nprotect society unless it knows the character and haunts of offenders.\r\nA health officer cannot execute the law for the protection of society's\r\nhealth unless he knows the haunts and habits of diseases. For this he\r\nmust look to vital statistics.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest service of vital statistics is the educational\r\ninfluence. Health administration cannot rise far above the hygienic\r\nstandards of those who provide the means for administering sanitary\r\nlaw. The taxpaying public must believe in the economy, utility, and\r\nnecessity of efficient health administration. Power and funds come\r\nfrom town councils and state legislatures. To convince and move these\r\nkeepers of the purse, trustworthy vital statistics are indispensable.\r\nInformation will be used for the benefit of all as soon as it is\r\npossessed by all.\r\n\r\nFortunately the gathering of vital statistics is not beyond the power\r\nof the kind of health officer that is found in small cities and in\r\nrural communities. If years of study of mathematics and of the\r\nstatistical method were required, we should despair of obtaining light\r\nwithin a century. But the facts we want are, for the most part, common,\r\neveryday facts, easily recognizable even by laymen; for example,\r\nbirths, deaths, age at death, causes of death, cases of transmissible\r\ndiseases, conditions found upon examination of children applying for\r\nwork certificates, etc. Where expert skill is required, as at state and\r\nnational headquarters, it can be found. Every layman can train himself\r\nto use skillfully the seven ingredients of the statistical method which\r\nit is his duty to employ, and to know when to pay for expert analysis\r\nand advice. We can all learn to base judgment of health needs upon the\r\nseven pillars,--desire to know, unit of inquiry, count, comparison,\r\npercentages, classification, and summary.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Dr. Arthur Newsholme's _Vital Statistics_ should be in public\r\nlibraries and on the shelves of health officers, public-spirited\r\nphysicians, and school superintendents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIS YOUR SCHOOL MANUFACTURING PHYSICAL DEFECTS?\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year a conference on the physical welfare of school children was\r\ntold by a woman principal: \"Of course we need physicians to examine our\r\nchildren and to teach the parents, but many of us principals believe\r\nthat our school curriculum and our school environment manufacture more\r\nphysical defects in a month than all your physicians and nurses will\r\ncorrect in a year.\" At the same meeting the physical director of\r\nschools of New York City appealed eloquently for \"biological engineers\"\r\nat school, who would test the child's strength as building engineers\r\nare employed to test the strength of beams and foundations.[8] As\r\nexplanation for the need of the then recently organized National School\r\nHygiene Association, he elaborated the proposition that school\r\nrequirements and school environment damage child health. \"Ocular\r\ndefects are in direct ratio to the length of time the pupil has\r\nattended school.... A desk that is too high may easily be the indirect\r\nagent for causing scoliosis, producing myopia or astigmatism....\r\nPhysically examine school children by all means, but do not fail to\r\nexamine school desks.\"\r\n\r\nFifty schools in different parts of New York City were examined last\r\nyear with especial reference to the factors likely to cause or to\r\naggravate physical defects.[9] The results, tabulated and analyzed,\r\nprove that the woman principal was right; many schools are so built or\r\nso conducted, many school courses are so devised or so executed, that\r\nchildren are inevitably injured by the environment in which the\r\ncompulsory education law forces them to spend their formative years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ONE OF NEW YORK CITY'S ROOF PLAYGROUNDS]\r\n\r\nRecently I noticed that our little office girl, so anaemic and nervous\r\nwhen she left school that we hesitated to employ her, was becoming rosy\r\nand spirited. The child herself explained the change: \"I like it\r\nbetter. I have more money to spend. I get more outdoor exercise, and\r\nthen, oh, the room is so much sunnier and there is more air and the\r\npeople are all so nice!\" And these were just the necessities which were\r\nlacking in the school from which she came. Moreover, it is a fair\r\ncommentary on the school work and the school hygiene in too many of our\r\ntowns and cities to-day. \"I like it better\" means that school work is\r\nnot adapted to the dominant interests of the child, that the curriculum\r\nincludes subjects remote from the needs and ambitions of the modern\r\nschool child, and fails to include certain other subjects which it\r\nrecognizes as useful and necessary, and therefore finds interesting.\r\n\"I have more money to spend\" means that this little girl was able to\r\nhave certain things, like a warm, pretty dress, rubbers, or an\r\noccasional trolley ride, which she longed for and needed. \"I get more\r\noutdoor exercise\" means that there was no open-air playground for her\r\nschool, that \"setting up\" exercises were forgotten, that recess was\r\ntaken up in rushing home, eating lunch, and rushing back again, and\r\nthat \"after school\" was filled up with \"helping mother with the\r\nhousework.\" \"The office is so much sunnier and I get more air\" accounts\r\nfor the increase in vitality; and \"the people are all so nice,\" for the\r\nhappy expression and initiative which the undiscriminating discipline\r\nat school had crushed out.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BONE TUBERCULOSIS IS ONE OF THE PENALTIES FOR DRY\r\n    SWEEPING AND FEATHER DUSTERS]\r\n\r\nFor such unsanitary conditions crowded sections of great cities have no\r\napologies to make to rural districts. A wealthy suburb recently learned\r\nthat there was overcrowding in every class room, and that one school\r\nbuilding was so unsanitary as to be a menace to the community.\r\nUnadjustable desks, dry sweeping, feather dusters, shiny blackboards,\r\nharassing discipline that wrecks nerves, excessive home study and\r\nsubjects that bore, are not peculiar to great cities. In a little\r\nwestern town a competition between two self-governing brigades for\r\nmerit points was determined by the amount of home study; looking back\r\nfifteen years, I can see that I was encouraging anaemic and\r\noverambitious children to rob themselves of play, sleep, and vitality.\r\nMany a rural school violates with impunity more laws of health than\r\ncity factories are now permitted to transgress.\r\n\r\nAfter child labor is stopped, national and state child labor committees\r\nwill learn that their real interest all the time has been child\r\nwelfare, not child age, and will be able to use much of the old\r\nliterature, simply substituting for \"factory\" the word \"school\" when\r\ncondemning \"hazardous occupations likely to sap [children's] nervous\r\nenergy, stunt their physical growth, blight their minds, destroy their\r\nmoral fiber, and fit them for the moral scrap heap.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the evils of school environment the teacher can avert, others\r\nthe school trustee should be expected to correct. So far as unsanitary\r\nconditions are permitted, the school accentuates home evils, whereas it\r\nshould counteract them by instilling proper health habits that will be\r\ntaken home and practiced. Questions such as were asked in Miss North's\r\nstudy will prove serviceable to any one desiring to know the probable\r\neffect of a particular school environment upon children subject to it.\r\nEspecially should principals, superintendents, directors, and volunteer\r\ncommitteemen apply such tests to the public, parochial, or private\r\nschool, orphanage or reformatory for which they may be responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Is follow-up work organized to enlist interest of parents, or, if\r\n    necessary, of outside agencies in fitting a child to do that for\r\n    which, if normal, he would be physically adapted?\r\n\r\nBy reducing the harm done by old buildings and by the traditions of\r\ncurriculum and discipline, teachers can do a great deal. Perhaps they\r\ncannot move the windows or the desks, but they can move the children.\r\nIf they cannot insure sanitary conditions for home study, they can cut\r\ndown the home study. If the directors do not provide proper\r\nblackboards, they can do less blackboard work. They can make children\r\nas conscious, as afraid, and as resentful of dirty air as of dirty\r\nteeth. They can make janitors believe that \"dry sweeping\" or \"feather\r\ndusting\" may give them consumption, and leave most of the dirt in the\r\nroom to make work for the next day; that adjustable desks are made to\r\nfit the child's legs and back, not the monkey wrench; that the\r\nthermometer in the schoolroom is a safer guide to heat needed than a\r\nboiler gauge in the basement; that fresh air heated by coal is cheaper\r\nfor the school fund than stale air heated by bodies and by bad breath.\r\nFinally, they can make known to pupils, to parents, to principals and\r\nsuperintendents, to health officials and to the public, the extent to\r\nwhich school environment violates the precepts of school hygiene.\r\n\r\nIf the state requires the attendance of all children between the ages\r\nof five and fourteen at school for five hours a day, for five days in\r\nthe week, for ten months in the year, then it should undertake to see\r\nthat the machinery it provides for the education of those children for\r\nthe greater part of the time for nine years of their lives--the\r\nformative years of their lives--is neither injuring their health nor\r\nretarding their full development.\r\n\r\nIf the amount of \"close-range\" work is rapidly manufacturing myopic\r\neyes; if bad ventilation, whether due to faulty construction or to\r\nfaulty management, is preparing soil for the tubercle bacillus; if\r\nchildren with contagious diseases are not found and segregated; if\r\ndesks are so ill adapted to children's sizes and physical needs that\r\nthey are forming crooked spines; if too many children are crowded into\r\none room; if lack of air and light is producing strained eyes and\r\nmalnutrition; if neither open air, space, nor time is provided for\r\nexercise, games, and physical training; if school discipline is adapted\r\nneither to the psychology nor the physiology of child or teacher, then\r\nthe state is depriving the child of a greater right than the compulsory\r\neducation law forces it to endure. Not only is the right to health\r\nsacrificed to the right to education, but education and health are both\r\nsacrificed.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking to enforce the compulsory education law, to put all\r\ntruants and child laborers in school, the state should be very sure for\r\nits own sake that it is not depriving the child of the health on which\r\ndepends his future usefulness to the state as well as to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XI\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF A CHILD LABOR LAW\r\n\r\nIncrease in Chicago Attendance\r\n\r\n                            Grades 4-9\r\n\r\n########                                                1901-1902\r\n\r\n#############                                           1902-1903\r\n\r\n######################################################  1903-1904\r\n\r\n                            Grades 9-15\r\n\r\n#######################                                 1901-1902\r\n\r\n####################                                    1902-1903\r\n\r\n######################################################  1903-1904\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] _The Sanitation of Public Buildings_, by William Paul Gerhard,\r\ncontains a valuable discussion of how the school may avoid manufacturing\r\nphysical defects.\r\n\r\n[9] By Professor Lila V. North, Baltimore College for Women, for the New\r\nYork Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children, 105 East 22d\r\nStreet, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER'S HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Teachers, gentlemen, no less than pupils, have a heaven-ordained right\r\nto work so adjusted that the highest possible physical condition shall\r\nbe maintained automatically.\" This declaration thundered out by an\r\nindignant physician startled a well-meaning board of school directors.\r\nThe teacher's right to health was, of course, obvious when once\r\nmentioned, and the directors concluded:\r\n\r\n  1. School conditions that injure child health also injure teacher\r\n  health.\r\n\r\n  2. Poor health of teacher causes poor health of pupil.\r\n\r\n  3. Poor health of pupil often causes poor health of teacher.\r\n\r\n  4. Adequate protection of children requires adequate protection of\r\n  their teachers.\r\n\r\n  5. Teachers have a right to health protection for their own sake\r\n  as well as for their children's sake.\r\n\r\nToo little concern has hitherto been shown for the vitality of teachers\r\nin private or public schools and colleges. Without protest, and without\r\nnotice until too late, teachers often neglect their own health at home\r\nand at school,--recklessly overwork, undersleep, and undernourish; ruin\r\ntheir eyes, their digestion, and their nerves. School-teachers are\r\nfrequently \"sweated\" as mercilessly as factory operatives. The time has\r\ncome to admit that a school environment which destroys the health of\r\nthe teacher is as unnecessary and reprehensible as an army camp that\r\nspreads typhoid among a nation's defenders. A school curriculum or a\r\ncollege tradition that breaks down teachers is as inexcusable as a gun\r\nthat kills the gunner when discharged. Experience everywhere else\r\nproves that periodic physical examinations and health precautions, not\r\nessays about \"happy teachers--happy pupils,\" are indispensable if\r\nteachers' health rights are to be protected.\r\n\r\nPhysical tests are imposed upon applicants for teachers' licenses by\r\nmany boards of education. In New York City about three per cent of\r\nthose examined are excluded for defects of vision, of hearing, of\r\nprobable endurance. Once a teacher, however, there is no further\r\nphysical examination,--no way of discovering physical incapacity,\r\nnothing to prevent a teacher from exposing class after class to\r\npulmonary tuberculosis contracted because of overwork and\r\nunderventilation. The certainty of salary increase year by year and of\r\na pension after the twentieth year will bribe many a teacher to overtax\r\nher own strength and to jeopardize her pupils' health.\r\n\r\nSeldom do training schools apply physical tests to students who intend\r\nto become teachers. One young girl says that before starting her normal\r\ncourse she is going to the physician of the board of education for\r\nexamination, so as to avoid the experience of one of her friends, who,\r\nafter preparing to be a teacher, was rejected because of pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis. During her normal course no examination will be\r\nnecessary. Overwork during the first year may cause pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis, and in spite of her foresight she, too, may be rejected\r\nfour years hence.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of physical examination upon beginning and during the\r\ncourses that prepare one for a teacher are so obvious that but little\r\nopposition will be given by prospective teachers. The disadvantages to\r\nteacher and pupil alike of suffering from physical defects are so\r\nobvious that every school which prepares men and women for teachers\r\nshould make registration and certification dependent upon passing a\r\nsatisfactory physical test. No school should engage a teacher who has\r\nnot good proof that she can do the required work without injury to her\r\nown or her pupils' health. Long before physicians can discover\r\npulmonary tuberculosis they can find depleted vitality which invites\r\nthis disease. Headaches due to eye trouble, undernourishment due to\r\nmouth breathing, preventable indigestion, are insidious enemies that\r\ncannot escape the physical test.\r\n\r\nThree objections to physical tests for teachers will be urged, but each\r\nloses its force when considered in the light of general experience.\r\n\r\n1. _A sickly teacher is often the most efficient teacher in a school or\r\na county._ It is true that some sickly teachers exert a powerful\r\ninfluence over their pupils, but in most instances their influence and\r\ntheir efficiency are due to powers that exist in spite of devitalizing\r\nelements. Rarely does sickness itself bring power. It must be admitted\r\nthat many a man is teaching who would be practicing law had his health\r\npermitted it. Many a woman's soul is shorn of its self-consciousness by\r\nsuffering. But even in these exceptional instances it is probable that\r\nchildren are paying too dearly for benefits directly or indirectly\r\ntraceable to defects that physical tests would exclude.\r\n\r\n2. _There are not enough healthy candidates to supply our schools._\r\nThis is begging the question. In fact, no one knows it is true. On the\r\ncontrary, it is probable that the teacher's opportunity will make even\r\na stronger appeal to competent men and women after physical soundness\r\nand vitality are made conditions of teaching,--after we all believe\r\nwhat leading educators now believe, that the highest fulfillment of\r\nhuman possibilities requires a normal, sound body, abounding in\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\n3. _Examination by a physician, especially if a social acquaintance, is\r\nan unnecessary embarrassment._ The false modesty that makes physical\r\nexamination unwelcome to many adults, men as well as women, is easily\r\novercome when the advantages of such examination are understood. It is\r\nlikewise easy to prove to a teacher that the loss of time required in\r\nhaving the examination is infinitesimal compared with the loss of time\r\ndue to ignoring physical needs. The programme for school hygiene\r\noutlined in Chapter XXVII, Part IV, assumes that state and county\r\nsuperintendents will provide for the examination of teachers as well as\r\nof pupils.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TEACHERS WILL PREFER PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS TO\r\n    FORCED VACATIONS\r\n    Boston Society for Relief and Study of Tuberculosis]\r\n\r\nBecause the health of others furnishes a stronger motive for preventive\r\nhygiene than our own health, it is probable that the general\r\nexamination of teachers will come first as the result of a general\r\nconviction that unhealthy teachers positively injure the health of\r\npupils and retard their mental development. Children at school age are\r\nso susceptible and imitative that their future habits of body and mind,\r\ntheir dispositions, their very voices and expressions, are influenced\r\nby those of their teachers. Experts in child study say that a child's\r\nvocal chords respond to the voices and noise about him before he is\r\nable to speak, so that the tones of his voice are determined before he\r\nis able to express them. This influence is also marked when the child\r\nbegins to talk. Babies and young children instinctively do what adults\r\nlearn not to do only by study,--follow the pitch of others' voices. Can\r\nwe then overestimate the effect upon pupils' character of teachers who\r\nradiate vitality?\r\n\r\nThe character and fitness, aside from scholarship, of applicants for\r\nteachers' licenses are now subjected by the board of examiners of New\r\nYork City to the following tests:\r\n\r\n  1. Moral character as indicated in the record of the applicant as\r\n  a student or teacher or in other occupation, or as a participant\r\n  in an examination.\r\n\r\n  2. Physical fitness for the position sought, reference being had\r\n  here to all questions of physical fitness other than those covered\r\n  in a physician's report as to \"sound health.\"\r\n\r\n  3. Satisfactory quality and use of voice.\r\n\r\n  4. Personal bearing, cleanliness, appearance, manners.\r\n\r\n  5. Self-command and power to win and hold the respect of teachers,\r\n  school authorities, and the community.\r\n\r\n  6. Capacity for school discipline, power to maintain order and to\r\n  secure the willing obedience and the friendship of pupils.\r\n\r\n  7. Business or executive ability,--power to comprehend and carry\r\n  out and to accomplish prescribed work, school management as\r\n  relating to adjustment of desks, lighting, heating, ventilation,\r\n  cleanliness, and attractiveness of schoolroom.\r\n\r\n  8. Capacity for supervision, for organization and administration\r\n  of a school, and for the instructing, assisting, and inspiring of\r\n  teachers.\r\n\r\nThese tests probably exclude few applicants who should be admitted.\r\nExperience proves that they include many who, for their own sake and\r\nfor children's sake, should be rejected. The moral character, physical\r\nfitness, quality of voice, personal bearing, self-command, executive\r\nability, capacity for supervision, are qualities that are modified by\r\nconditions. The voice that is satisfactory in conference with an\r\nexaminer may be strident and irritating when the teacher is impatient\r\nor is trying to overcome street noises. On parade applicants are\r\nequally cleanly; this cannot be said of teachers in the service, coming\r\nfrom different home environments. Self-command is much easier in one\r\nschool than in another. Physical fitness in a girl of twenty may,\r\nduring one short year of teaching, give way to physical unfitness.\r\nTherefore the need for _periodic tests_ by principal, superintendent,\r\nand school board, _to determine the continuing fitness_ of a teacher to\r\ndo the special task assigned to her, based upon physical evidence of\r\nher own vitality and of her favorable influence upon her pupils' health\r\nand enjoyment of school life. Shattered nerves due to overwork may\r\nexplain a teacher's shouting: \"You are a dirty boy. Your mother is a\r\ndirty woman and keeps a dirty store where no decent people will go to\r\nbuy.\" A physical examination of that unfortunate teacher would probably\r\nshow that she ought to be on leave of absence, rather than, by her\r\noverwork and loss of control, to cause the boys of her class to feel\r\nwhat one of them expressed: \"Grandmother, if she spoke so of my mother\r\nI would strike her.\"\r\n\r\nJust as there should be a central bureau to count and correct the open\r\nmouths and closed minds that clog the little old red schoolhouse of the\r\ncountry, so a central bureau should discover in the city teacher as\r\nwell as in the country teacher the ailments more serious than\r\ntuberculosis that pass from teacher to pupil; slovenliness, ugly\r\ntemper, frowning, crossness, lack of ambition, cynicism,--these should\r\nbe blackballed as well as consumption, contagious morphine habit, and\r\ncontagious skin disease. Crooked thinking by teacher leads to crooked\r\nthinking by pupil. Disregard of health laws by teacher encourages\r\nunhygienic living by pupils. A man whose fingers are yellow, nerves\r\nshaky, eyes unsteady, and mind alternately sleepy and hilarious from\r\ncigarettes, cannot convey pictures of normal, healthy physical living,\r\nnor can he successfully teach the moral and social evils of nicotinism.\r\nBoth teacher and pupil have a right to the periodic physical\r\nexamination of teachers that will give timely warning of attention\r\nneeded. Until there is some system for giving this right to all\r\nteachers in private, parochial, charitable, and public schools, we\r\nshall produce many nervous, acrid, and physically threadbare teachers,\r\nwhere we should have only teachers who inspire their pupils with a\r\npassion for health by the example of a good complexion, sprightly step,\r\nbounding vitality, and forceful personality born of hygienic living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. COOePERATION IN MEETING HEALTH OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN REMEDIES: DOING THINGS AT SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently I traveled five hundred miles to address an audience on\r\nmethods of fitting health remedies to local health needs. I told of\r\ncertain dangers to be avoided, of results that had always followed\r\ncertain remedies, of motives to be sought and used, of community ends\r\nto seek. Not knowing the local situation, I could not tell them exactly\r\nwhat to do next, or how or with whom to do it; not seeing the patient\r\nor his symptoms, I did not diagnose the disease or prescribe medicine.\r\nSeveral members of the audience who were particularly anxious to start\r\na new organization on a metropolitan model were disappointed because\r\nthey were told, not just how to organize, but rather how to find out\r\nwhat sort of organization their town needed. They were right in\r\nbelieving that it was easier to copy on paper a plan tried somewhere\r\nelse, than to think out a plan for themselves. They had forgotten for\r\nthe time being their many previous disappointments due to copying\r\nwithout question some plan of social work, just as they copy Paris or\r\nNew York fashions. They had not expected to leave this meeting with the\r\nconviction that while the _ends_ of sanitary administration may be the\r\nsame in ten communities, health _machinery_ should fit a particular\r\ncommunity like a tailor-made suit.\r\n\r\nAmerican-like, they had a mania for organization. I once heard an aged\r\nkindergartner--the savant of an isolated German village--describe my\r\nfellow-Americans as follows: \"Every American belongs to some\r\norganization. The total abstainers are organized, the brewers are\r\norganized, the teachers are organized, the parents are organized, the\r\nyoung people and even the juniors are organized. Finally, those who\r\nbelong to no organization go off by themselves and organize a society\r\nof the unorganized.\" Love of organization and love of copying have\r\ngiven us Americans a feverish desire for what we see or read about in\r\nEurope. When we talk about our European remedies we try to make\r\nourselves believe that we are broad-minded and want to learn from\r\nothers' experience. In a large number of cases our impatient demand for\r\nEuropean remedies is similar to the schoolboy's desire to show off the\r\nmanners, the slang, or the clothes picked up on his first visit away\r\nfrom home. With many travelers and readers European remedies or\r\nEuropean ways are souvenirs of a pleasant visit, to be described like a\r\ncollection of postal cards, a curious umbrella, a cane associated with\r\nAlpine climbing, or a stolen hymnal from an historic cathedral.\r\n\r\nExperience proves, however, that just as Roman walls and Norman castles\r\nlook out of place in New York and Kansas, so European laws and European\r\nremedies are too frequently misfits when tried by American schools,\r\nhospitals, or city governments. Yesterday a Canadian clergyman, after\r\npreaching an eloquent sermon, met a professional beggar on the street\r\nin New York City and emptied his purse--of Canadian money! Quite like\r\nthis is the enthusiastic demand of the tourist who has seen or read\r\nabout \"the way it's done in Germany.\" The trouble is that European\r\nremedies are valued like ruins, by their power to interest, by their\r\nantiquity or picturesqueness, or, like the beggar, by their power to\r\nstimulate temporary emotion. But we do not sleep in ruins, go to\r\nchurch regularly in thirteenth-century abbeys, or live under the\r\nremedies that fire our imagination. We do not therefore see their\r\neveryday, practical-result side.\r\n\r\nThe souvenir value of European remedies is due to the assumption that\r\nno better way was open to the European, and that the remedy actually\r\ndoes what it is intended to do. Because free meals are given at school\r\nto cure and prevent undernourishment, it is taken for granted that\r\nundernourishment stops when free meals are introduced; therefore\r\nAmerica must have free meals. Because it is made compulsory in a\r\ncharming Italian village for every child to eat the free school meal,\r\nit is taken for granted that the children of that village have no\r\nphysical defects; therefore let Kansas City, Seattle, and Boston\r\nintroduce compulsory free meals. But when one goes to Europe to see\r\nexactly how those much-advertised, eulogized remedies operate from day\r\nto day, it is often necessary to write, as did a great American\r\nsanitarian recently, of health administration in foreign cities\r\ncontinually held up as models to American cities: \"In spite of the\r\nrules and theories over here, the patient has better care in New York\r\nCity.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been asked of late to copy several very attractive European\r\nremedies for the physiological ills of school children, and for the\r\nphysical deficiencies of the next generation of adults: breakfasts or\r\nlunches, or both, at school for all children, rich as well as poor,\r\nwhether they want school nourishment or not; school meals for the poor\r\nonly; school meals to be given the poor, but to be bought by those who\r\ncan afford the small sum required; free eyeglasses for the poor, for\r\npoor and well-to-do, for those who wish them, for those who need them\r\nwhether they want to wear eyeglasses or not; free dental care; free\r\nsurgical treatment; free rides and outings during summer and winter;\r\ncountry children to visit the metropolis, city children to visit\r\ncountry and village; free treatment in the country of all children\r\nwhose parents are consumptives; free rides on street cars to and from\r\nschool; city-owned street railways that will prevent congestion by\r\nmaking the country accessible; city-built tenements to prevent\r\novercrowding, dark rooms, insufficient air and light; free coal, free\r\nclothes, free rent for those whose parents are unable to protect them\r\nproperly against hunger and cold. Every one of these remedies is\r\nattractive. Every one is being tried somewhere, and can be justified on\r\nemotional, economic, and educational grounds, if we think only of its\r\npurpose. Let us view them with the eyes of their advocates.\r\n\r\nWould it not be nice for country children to know that toward the end\r\nof the school year they would be given an excursion to the largest city\r\nof their state, to its slums, its factories, parks, and art galleries?\r\nThey would grow up more intelligent about geography. They would read\r\nhistory, politics, sociology, and civil government with greater\r\ninterest. They would have less contracted sympathies. They might even\r\ndecide that they would rather live their life in the spacious country\r\nthan in the crowded, rushing city.\r\n\r\nCity children, on the other hand, would reap worlds of physical benefit\r\nand untold inspiration from periods of recreation and study in the\r\ncountry, with its quiet, its greens and bronzes and yellows, its birds\r\nand animals, its sky that sits like a dome on the earth, its\r\nhopefulness. Winter sleigh rides and coasting would give new vigor and\r\nambition. Why spend so much on teaching physiology, geography, and\r\nnature study, if in the end we fail to send the child where alone\r\nnature and hygiene tell their story? Why tax ourselves to teach history\r\nand sociology and commercial geography out of books when excursions to\r\nthe city and country will paint pictures on the mind that can never be\r\nerased? What more attractive or more reasonable than appetizing, warm\r\nmeals, or cool salads and drinks for the boys and girls who carry\r\ntheir little dinner pails and baskets down the long road where\r\neverything runs together in summer and everything freezes in winter?\r\nOne needs little imagination to see the \"smile that won't come off,\"\r\nhealth, punctuality, and school interest resulting from the school\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nAgain, if children must have teeth filled and pulled, eyes tested and\r\nfitted for glasses, adenoids and enlarged tonsils removed, surely the\r\nschool environment offers the least affrighting spot for the tragedy.\r\nThence goblins long ago fled. There courage, real or feigned, is\r\nbrought to the surface by the anxious, critical, competitive interest\r\nof one's peers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A SOUTH IRELAND ARGUMENT FOR \"DOING THINGS\"]\r\n\r\nThe economic defense of these remedies is many-sided. An English\r\ndrummer once instructed me during a railroad journey from southern to\r\nnorthern Ireland. As we entered the fertile fields of Lord Dunraven's\r\nestate near Athlone, I expressed sympathy for other countries\r\nimpoverished of soil, of wealth, and of thrift. My instructor replied:\r\n\"It would pay the government to bring them all to this land free once a\r\nyear, just to show them what they are missing.\" That his idea of an\r\ninvestment is sound has been proved by railroads and land companies and\r\neven by states, who give away excursions to entice settlers and buyers.\r\nAmbition at almost any cost is cheaper than indifference to\r\nopportunity. It would be cheaper for our American taxpayer to send\r\nschool children to city and country than to pay the penalty for having\r\na large number of citizens with narrow interests, unconscious of the\r\nstruggles and joys of their co-citizens. Free meals, free books, free\r\nrides, free eyeglasses, are cheaper than free instruction for the\r\nsecond, third, and sixth terms in studies not passed because of\r\nphysical defects,--infinitely cheaper than jails and almshouses, truant\r\nofficers and courthouses.\r\n\r\nThe demoralizing results of giving \"something for nothing\" did not\r\nfollow free schooling or free text-books. Perhaps they would not follow\r\nthe free remedies that we are asked to copy from Europe. In fact, the\r\nword \"free\" is the wrong word. These remedies rather require\r\ncooeperation of parent with parent. It has demoralized nobody because\r\nthe streets are cleaned by all of us, country roads made by the\r\ntownship, police paid for by taxes and not by volunteer subscription.\r\n\r\nThe man whose children do not need glasses or nourishment or operation\r\nfor adenoids would find it cheaper to pay for European remedies than\r\nfor the useless schooling of boys unable to get along in school because\r\nof removable defects. An unruly, uninterested boy sitting beside your\r\nboy in public school, a pampered, overfed, undisciplined child sitting\r\nbeside yours at private school, is taxing you without your consent and\r\ndoing your child injury that may prove irreparable.\r\n\r\nIt costs $2.50 to furnish a child with eyeglasses. It costs $25 to $50\r\nto give that child a year's schooling. If the child cannot see right\r\nand fails in his studies, we have lost a good investment and, after one\r\nyear so lost, we are out $22.50. In two years we have lost $47.50. But,\r\nwhat is more serious, we have discouraged that boy. Used to failure in\r\nschool, his mind turns to other things. He is made to think that it is\r\nuseless for him to try for first place. Perhaps he can play ball, and\r\nexcels. He chooses a career of ball playing. Valuable years are lost.\r\n\r\nInitiative and competition are not interrupted any more by free\r\neyeglasses and free operation for adenoids than by free schooling.\r\nThere is only one place in the world where there is less competition or\r\nless struggle than among the ignorant, and that is among the ignorant\r\nand unwell. The boy who can't see the blackboard, who can't learn to\r\nspell, who can't breathe through his nose, and can't be interested,\r\ndoesn't compete at all with the bright, healthy boy. Remove the\r\nadenoids, give glasses, make interest possible, and fitness to survive\r\ntakes a higher level because larger numbers become fit to survive.\r\n\r\nProfessor Patten says that it is easier to support in the almshouse\r\nthan in competitive industry a man who cannot earn more than $1.50 a\r\nday. The question, therefore, regarding European remedies is not, To\r\nwhat general theory do they belong? but, What will they accomplish? How\r\ndo they compare with other remedies of which we know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nAMERICAN REMEDIES: GETTING THINGS DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York City there is a committee called the Committee on the\r\nPhysical Welfare of School Children. The word \"welfare\" was used rather\r\nthan \"condition\" because the committee proposed to use whatever facts\r\nit could gather for the improvement of home and school conditions\r\nprejudicial to child welfare. The following programme was adopted:\r\n\r\n 1. _Study of the physical welfare of school children._\r\n\r\n    a. Examination of board of health records of children needing\r\n       medical, dental, or ocular care, and better nourishment.\r\n\r\n    b. Home visitation of such children, in order to ascertain\r\n       whether their need arises from deficient income or from other\r\n       causes.\r\n\r\n    c. Effort to secure proper treatment, either from parents or\r\n       from free clinics or other established agencies.\r\n\r\n    d. Effort to secure proper physical surroundings of children\r\n       while at school--playgrounds, baths, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. _Effort to secure establishment of such a system of school\r\n    records and reports_ as will disclose automatically significant\r\n    school facts,--e.g. regarding backward pupils, truancy,\r\n    regularity of attendance, registered children not attending,\r\n    sickness, physical defects, etc.\r\n\r\n 3. _Effort to utilize available information regarding school needs_\r\n    so as to stimulate public interest and thus aid in securing\r\n    adequate appropriations to meet school needs.\r\n\r\nThe committee grew out of the discussion, in the year 1905, of the\r\nfollowing proposition: _To insure a race physically able to receive our\r\nvaunted free education, we must provide at school free meals, free\r\neyeglasses, free medical and dental care._ Thanks to the\r\nsuperintendent of schools of New York City, to Robert Hunter's\r\n_Poverty_, to John Spargo's _Bitter Cry of the Children_, hundreds of\r\nthousands of American citizens were made to realize for the first time\r\nthat a large proportion of our school children are in serious need of\r\nmedical, dental, or ocular attention, or of better nourishment.\r\n\r\nBecause physicians, dentists, oculists, hospitals, dispensaries, relief\r\nagencies, had seemingly been unconscious of this serious state of\r\naffairs, they had no definite, constructive remedy to propose. Their\r\nunpreparedness served to strengthen the arguments for the European\r\nmethod of _doing things_. France, Germany, Italy, England, had found it\r\nnecessary to do things at school. Arguing from their experience, it was\r\nonly a matter of time when American cities must follow their example.\r\nWhy not, therefore, begin at once to deal radically with the situation\r\nand give school meals, school eyeglasses, etc.? Those who organized the\r\nCommittee on the Physical Welfare of School Children realized the\r\ndanger of trying to settle so great a question with the little definite\r\ninformation then available. If _doing things at school_ were to be\r\nadopted as a principle and logically carried out, vast sums must be\r\nadded to the present cost of the public school system. Complications\r\nwould arise with private and parochial schools, whose children might\r\nhave quite as serious physical defects, even though not educated by\r\npublic funds. It would be difficult to obtain proper rooms for medical\r\nand dental treatment and meals, and perhaps still more difficult to\r\ninsure proper food, skilled oculists, dentists, surgeons, and\r\nphysicians. No one was clear as to how the problem was to be solved by\r\nsmall cities and rural districts, whose needy children are no less\r\nentitled to public aid simply because their numbers are smaller. Great\r\nas were the difficulties, however, the committee saw that difficulties\r\nare in themselves no reason for not doing the right thing. On the\r\nother hand, if doing things at school is wrong, if school meals fail to\r\ncorrect and remove physical defects, great social and educational wrong\r\nwould result from New York's setting an example that would not only\r\nmisdirect funds and attention in that city, but would undoubtedly lead\r\nother cities to move in the wrong direction. Right could be hastened,\r\nwrong could be prevented more effectually by facts than by any amount\r\nof theory. School meals had been made a political issue in England. The\r\narguments supporting them were stronger than any possible arguments\r\nagainst them, except proof that they would be less effective in helping\r\nchildren than other means that might be proposed. If the American\r\npeople must choose between sickly, unteachable, dull children without\r\nschool meals, on the one hand, and bright, teachable, healthy children\r\nplus school meals, on the other hand, they will not hesitate because of\r\nexpense or eighteenth-century objections to \"socialism.\"\r\n\r\nDuring one year of investigation and of _getting things done_ the\r\ncommittee has prepared three studies for publication: (1) a report on\r\nthe home conditions of fourteen hundred school children of different\r\nnationalities, found by school physicians to have defects of vision,\r\nbreathing, hearing, teeth, and nourishment; (2) an examination of fifty\r\nschools--curriculum, buildings, home-study requirements, play space and\r\nplaytime, physical culture--in an attempt to answer the question, How\r\nfar does school environment directly cause or aggravate physical\r\ndefects of school children; (3) a comparative study of methods now\r\nemployed in a hundred cities to record, classify, and make public\r\nsignificant school facts.\r\n\r\nThe results of the first year's work prove conclusively that physical\r\ndefects are not caused solely by the inability of parents to pay for\r\nproper food. Among the twenty significant facts reported by the\r\ncommittee are the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Physical defects found in public schools are, for the most\r\n  part, such as frequently occur in wealthy families and do not of\r\n  themselves presume as the cause insufficient income. Of 145\r\n  reported for malnutrition, 44 were from families having over $20\r\n  weekly.\r\n\r\n  2. Few of the defects can be corrected by nourishment alone;\r\n  plenty of fresh air, outside nourishment at school, or extra\r\n  nourishment at home will not entirely counteract the influences of\r\n  bad ventilation and bad light in school buildings. Country\r\n  children have adenoids, bad teeth, and malnutrition. Plenty of\r\n  food will not prevent bad teeth and bad ventilation from causing\r\n  adenoids, enlarged tonsils, and malnutrition.\r\n\r\n  3. Children whose parents have long lived in the United States\r\n  need attention quite as much as the recent immigrant.\r\n\r\n  4. A large part of the defects reported could be produced by\r\n  conditions due directly to neglect of teeth.\r\n\r\nFrom twenty such statements of fact and from its experience in _getting\r\nthings done_ for one year, the committee drew fifteen practical\r\nconclusions, among which the following deserve emphasis here:\r\n\r\n  1. The only new thing about the physical defects of school\r\n  children is not their existence, but our recent awakening to their\r\n  existence, their prevalence, their seriousness if neglected, and\r\n  their cost to individual children, to school progress, to\r\n  industry, and to social welfare.\r\n\r\n  2. _Physical deterioration_, applied to America's school children,\r\n  is a misnomer. No evidence whatever has been given that the\r\n  percentage of children suffering from physical defects in 1907 is\r\n  greater than the percentage of children suffering from such\r\n  defects in 1857. On the contrary, the small proportion of defects\r\n  that are not easily removable, as well as a vast amount of\r\n  evidence from medical experience and vital statistics, indicates\r\n  that, if a comparison were possible, the children of 1907 would be\r\n  found to have sounder bodies and fewer defects than their\r\n  predecessors of fifty years ago. If there is an exception to this\r\n  statement, it is probably defects of vision, with regard to which\r\n  school authorities and oculists seem to agree that confinement in\r\n  school for longer hours and more constant application under\r\n  unfavorable lighting conditions have caused a marked increase.\r\n  Positive evidence as to tendencies will be easily obtained after\r\n  thorough physical examination has been carried on for a\r\n  generation.\r\n\r\n  3. The effect of massing facts as to physical defects of school\r\n  children should not be to cause alarm, but to stimulate remedial\r\n  and preventive measures, to invoke congratulations and aggressive\r\n  optimism, not doleful pessimism and palliative measures born of\r\n  despair.\r\n\r\n  4. The causes of physical defects are not confined to \"marginal\"\r\n  incomes, but, while more apt to be present in families having\r\n  small incomes, are found among all incomes wherever there exist\r\n  bad ventilation, insufficient outdoor exercise, improper light,\r\n  irregular eating, overeating, improper as well as insufficient\r\n  food, lack of medical, dental, and ocular attention.\r\n\r\n  5. Whatever may be said of free meals at school as a means of\r\n  insuring punctual attendance or better attention, they are\r\n  inadequate to correct physical conditions that home and street\r\n  environment produce.\r\n\r\n  6. _To remove physical defects, causal conditions among all income\r\n  classes should be treated, and not merely symptoms revealed at\r\n  school by children of the so-called poor._\r\n\r\n  7. Parents can and will correct the greater part of the defects\r\n  discovered by the physical examination of school children, if\r\n  shown what steps to take. Where parents refuse to do what can be\r\n  proved to be within their power, and where existing laws are\r\n  nonenforced or inadequate, the segregation of children having\r\n  physical defects in special classes might prove an effective\r\n  stimulus to obstinate parents.\r\n\r\n  8. Where parents are unable to pay for medical, dental, and ocular\r\n  care and proper nourishment, private philanthropy must either\r\n  provide adequately or expect the state to step in and assume the\r\n  duty.\r\n\r\n  9. Private dispensaries and hospitals must either arrange\r\n  themselves to treat cases and to educate communities as to the\r\n  importance of detecting and correcting physical defects, or must\r\n  expect the state to provide hospital and dispensary care. Until\r\n  private hospitals and dispensaries take steps to prevent people\r\n  with adequate incomes from imposing upon them for free treatment,\r\n  it is difficult to make out a case against free eyeglasses and\r\n  free meals for school children.\r\n\r\n  10. Either private philanthropy or the state must take steps to\r\n  procure more dental clinics and an educational policy on the part\r\n  of the dental profession that will prevent the exploitation of the\r\n  poor when dental care is needed.\r\n\r\n  11. The United States Bureau of Education is the only agency with\r\n  authority and equipment adequate to secure from all sections of\r\n  the country proper attention to the subject. Nothing in the world\r\n  can prevent free meals, free eyeglasses, free medical care, free\r\n  material relief at school, unless educational use is made by each\r\n  community of the facts learned through physical examination to\r\n  correct home, school, and street conditions that produce and\r\n  aggravate physical defects. The national bureau can mass\r\n  information in such a way as to convince budget makers in city,\r\n  county, and state to vote gladly the funds necessary to promote\r\n  the physical welfare of school children.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE DARK-HALL EVIL IS HERE INDEXED BY ADENOIDS.]\r\n\r\nHow the committee got things done is often referred to. There is\r\nsomething about a request for cooeperation, whether by schools or by any\r\nother agency, that enlists the interest of those whose help is asked.\r\nThe reason is not that people are flattered by requests to serve on\r\ncommittees, or that human nature finds it difficult to be unfriendly or\r\nunkind. On the contrary, men and women are by nature social; there is\r\nmore joy in giving than in withholding, in working with others than in\r\nworking alone. Men and women, official and volunteer agencies, will\r\ncooeperate with school-teachers when invited, for the same reason and\r\nwith the same readiness that ninety-nine farmers out of a hundred, on\r\nthe prairie or in the mountain, will welcome a request for food and\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WHERE \"GETTING THINGS DONE\" IS POSSIBLE BUT\r\n    \"DOING THINGS\" INEFFECTIVE]\r\n\r\nMothers will naturally take a greater interest in the welfare of their\r\nchildren if held responsible for proper food and proper home\r\nsurroundings than if not reminded of their responsibility. In New York\r\nCity a woman district superintendent of schools, Miss Julia Richman,\r\nhas organized a unique \"social settlement.\" She and several\r\nschool-teachers occupy a house, known as \"The Teachers' House.\" This is\r\ntheir residence. Here they are subject to neither intrusion nor\r\nimportunity; no clubs or classes are held here; visitors are treated as\r\nguests, not as beneficiaries. The purpose these teachers have in living\r\ntogether is to work out the methods of interesting private and official\r\nleaders in community needs disclosed at school.\r\n\r\nWhere clubs and social gatherings are held in school buildings, it is\r\nnot unusual for a thousand mothers, recent immigrants, to meet together\r\nin one hall to hear talks on the care of children. Thus, instead of\r\nprincipals, teachers, and physicians taking the place of mothers (which\r\nthey nowhere have succeeded in doing), they do succeed in harnessing\r\nmothers to the school programme. It may take two, three, or ten visits\r\nto get a particular mother to do the necessary thing for her child, but\r\nwhen once convinced and once inspired to do that thing, she will go on\r\nday in and day out doing the right thing for that child and for all\r\nothers in her home. It may take a year to convert a police magistrate\r\nwhose sympathy for delinquent parents and truant children is an active\r\npromoter of disorder; but a magistrate convinced, efficient, and\r\ninterested is worth a hundred volunteer visitors. To get things done in\r\nthis way for a hundred thousand children costs less in time and money\r\nthan to do the necessary things for one thousand children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCOOePERATION WITH DISPENSARIES AND CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nScientists agree that the human brain is superior to the animal brain,\r\nnot because it is heavier, but because it is finer and better supplied\r\nwith nerves. As one writer has said, the human brain is better \"wired,\"\r\nhas better organized \"centrals.\" A poor system of centrals will spoil a\r\ntelephone service, no matter how many wires it provides. An independent\r\nwire is of little use, because it will not reach the person desired at\r\nthe other end. The ideal system is that which almost instantly connects\r\ntwo persons, no matter how far away or how many other people are\r\ntalking at the same time on other wires.\r\n\r\nThe school that tries to do everything for its pupils without using\r\nother existing agencies for helping children[10] will be like the man\r\nwho refuses to connect his telephone with a central switch board, or\r\nlike a bank that will not use the central clearing house. As one\r\ntelephone center can enable scores of people to talk at once, and as\r\none clearing house can make one check pay fifty debts, so hospital and\r\nrelief agencies enable a teacher who employs \"central\" to help several\r\ntimes as many children as she alone can help.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ADEQUATE RELIEF RECOGNIZES THE FAMILY AS THE\r\n    UNIT]\r\n\r\nIt seems easier for a teacher to give twenty-five cents to a child in\r\ndistress than to see that the cause of the misery is removed. In New\r\nYork City there are over five hundred school principals, under them are\r\nover fifteen thousand teachers, and the average attendance of children\r\nis about six hundred thousand, representing one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand homes. If teachers give only to those children who ask for\r\nhelp, many will be neglected. In certain sections of the city\r\nprincipals have combined to establish a relief fund to be given out to\r\nchildren who need food, clothes, shoes, etc. One principal had to stop\r\nreplacing stolen overcoats because, when it was known that he had a\r\nfund, an astonishingly large number of overcoats disappeared. At\r\nPoughkeepsie school children get up parties, amateur vaudeville,\r\nminstrel shows, basket picnics, to obtain food and clothing for\r\nchildren in distress. They are, of course, unable to help parents or\r\nchildren not in school. Of this method a district superintendent in New\r\nYork said to his teachers and principals: \"For thirty-two years I have\r\nbeen working in the schools of this district. I have given food and\r\nshoes to thousands of children. I know that however great our interest\r\nin a particular child when it comes to us with trouble at home, our\r\nduty as teachers prevents us from following our gift into the home and\r\nlearning the cause of the child's trouble. This last winter we have\r\nmade an experiment in using a central society, which makes it a\r\nbusiness to find out what the family needs, to supply necessaries,\r\ncountry board, medicine, etc. We now know that we can put a slip of\r\npaper with the name and address of the child into a general hopper and\r\nit will come out eyeglasses, food, rent, vacation parties, as the need\r\nmay be.\"\r\n\r\nRelief at home through existing agencies was brought about by the\r\ndistribution of cards like those on opposite page, which offer winter\r\nand summer cooeperation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FRESH-AIR AGENCIES LIKE SEA BREEZE PREFER TO AID\r\n    CHILDREN IN ORDER OF NEED]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Facsimile of flyer for the New York Association\r\n    for Improving the Condition of the Poor.)]\r\n\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n | =For School Children=                                              |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | Compulsory education implies the ability of all families, even the |\r\n | poorest, to take advantage of school benefits.

In many\r\ncases parents were very angry that their children should have asked for\r\nhelp. But help given in instances like the following soon proved to\r\nteachers that they could afford the time necessary to notice children\r\nwho appeared neglected, when so much good would ensue:\r\n\r\n  The father is sick and unable to work. They cannot get clothes for\r\n  the children, who are not attending school on that account.\r\n  Children were provided with shoes and clothes.\r\n\r\n  November 30, 1907, a school principal reported that six children\r\n  in one family needed underwear. A visitor discovered that one of\r\n  the boys who had the reputation of being unruly and light-fingered\r\n  also had adenoids. He was taken to a hospital for operation, and\r\n  was later interested in his school work.\r\n\r\n  A little girl was unruly and truant. No attempt was made to keep\r\n  her at school, but she was reported to the Committee on the\r\n  Physical Welfare of School Children. The parents could not control\r\n  her. The girl was taken for examination by a specialist and found\r\n  to be feeble-minded. Later she was sent to a custodial institute.\r\n\r\n  Another little girl was nine years old, but could not talk. A\r\n  University Extension Society worker found that she was not kept at\r\n  school because it was too much trouble. The child was taken to a\r\n  physician who operated and corrected the tongue-tie.\r\n\r\n  A girl of twelve said she must stay home to \"help mother.\" The\r\n  mother was found to be a janitress, temporarily incapacitated by\r\n  rheumatism. A substitute was provided until the mother was well,\r\n  and all the children were properly clad for school.\r\n\r\n  After the adenoid operations in a New York school that occasioned\r\n  the East Side riots of 1906, the physicians and principals who had\r\n  persuaded parents to permit the operations were fearful lest the\r\n  summer in unsanitary surroundings might make the demonstration\r\n  less complete. Over forty children in three parties were sent away\r\n  for the summer, where they had wholesome food and all the milk\r\n  they could drink and fresh air day and night. When they returned\r\n  in the fall the principal wrote: \"The improvement in each\r\n  individual is simply marvelous. We shall try to continue this\r\n  condition and shall constantly urge the parents to keep up the\r\n  good work by means of proper food and fresh air.\"\r\n\r\nIn none of these instances could the teachers have accomplished equal\r\nresults for the individual children or for the families without\r\nneglecting school duties. By informing other agencies as to children's\r\nneeds, teachers started movements that have since helped practically\r\nevery school child in New York City. Dispensaries are setting aside\r\nseparate hours for school children; fresh-air agencies are giving\r\npreference to children found by teachers or school physicians to be in\r\nphysical need; relief agencies are making \"rush orders\" of every note\r\nfrom teachers; the health board is more active because volunteer\r\nagencies have added their voice to that of teacher and health officer\r\nin demanding adequate funds for physical examination of school\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"CENTRAL\" FOUND THE MOTHER SICK IN A HOSPITAL,\r\n    THE FATHER KILLED--THE CHILDREN WERE BOARDED IN THE COUNTRY\r\n    UNTIL THE MOTHER RECOVERED]\r\n\r\nCooeperation is at present easier in New York than in any other city.\r\nCharitable societies, hospitals, dispensaries, are probably more keenly\r\nalive to their responsibilities and are at least more apt to have\r\nacquired the habit of cooeperation when asked. Yet even here I have been\r\ntold repeatedly by teachers: \"If we have to wait for that hospital or\r\nthat charitable society, our children will go barefoot.\" In small\r\ncommunities where hospital and relief agencies are for emergencies only\r\nand generally inactive, it seems that the first thing to do is to ask\r\nsome friends to establish a small relief fund, just as it is easier to\r\ngive a child a five-cent meal than to teach its mother how to prepare\r\nits food. But the school-teacher will find that it takes very much less\r\nenergy to arouse the relief society than to maintain her own relief\r\nwork. In fact, in many cities nothing could do more to strengthen\r\nhospitals and charitable societies than to put them in touch with the\r\nneeds of school children. For a principal to make known the fact that\r\nschool children are neglected will help the charitable society and\r\nhospital to get the funds necessary to do their part better than they\r\nare now doing it and better than the school could ever do it. Finally,\r\none reason for a breakdown of charitable societies is not their own\r\ninadequacy, but rather the failure of the school and church to make\r\nuse of an agency better equipped than themselves to give material\r\nrelief. The teacher sees the child every day, while the relief society\r\nwill never see it and has no reason to see it until some one calls\r\nattention to it. The very first step, and an indispensable one in\r\nrelief policy, is for teachers to be on the lookout for children not\r\nadequately provided for, and then have the physical evidence discovered\r\nat school followed to the home for the cause of the child's distress.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HOME-TO-HOME INSTRUCTION IN COOKING\r\n    Anaemic condition of child due to bad cooking, not to lack of\r\n    income]\r\n\r\n_Cooeperation_ removes the cause of distress; _doing_ may aggravate it.\r\nTeachers would do well to draw up for themselves a chart which will\r\nshow exactly what part of the community's work can be best done by\r\ntheir school. On the following page is charted the social work now\r\nbeing conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. So far\r\nas agencies exist to deal with any individual or family problem coming\r\ninto the social-work square, the hospital aims to utilize that agency.\r\nIts own direct dealing with neurasthenics, with hygiene education, with\r\nsexual deviates, is primarily for the purpose of giving adequate\r\ntreatment to the needy, and secondarily to demonstrate how adequate\r\ntreatment should be organized for the community. Please to note that\r\ngovernmental agencies are not mentioned in Dr. Cabot's chart. This does\r\nnot mean that he would not emphasize the importance of those agencies,\r\nbut that up to the present time, for the particular cases dealt with in\r\nhis clinics, governmental agencies can be reached most effectively\r\nthrough the private charitable agencies in the reference square. So the\r\nteacher will frequently find that the relief bureau, children's\r\nsociety, public education association, or church can get better results\r\nfor her pupils from public health and correctional agencies than can\r\nshe by writing directly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHART OF SOCIAL WORK, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\n                   +-----------------------------------+\r\n                   | _Work for the Tuberculous_        |\r\n                   |                                   |\r\n                   | 1.

Fortunately, however, the distress is generally of such a kind,\r\nand the teacher so well acquainted with all the parents of her\r\ndistrict, that it will not be difficult to procure such attention as is\r\nnecessary. Country schools should be furnished by county and state\r\nsuperintendents with clear directions for getting the treatment\r\nafforded in the immediate vicinity. Where teachers are alone in seeing\r\nthe need for cooeperation they can quickly interest young and old,\r\nphysicians, dentists, pastors, health officers, in home visiting,\r\nstreet cleaning, nursing, helping truants, needed changes of\r\ncurriculum, etc. _Getting things done_ is easy because it is human to\r\nlove the _doing_; getting things done is _doing_ of the highest order.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The importance of recognizing the family as the unit of social\r\ntreatment is presented in Edward T. Devine's _Principles of Relief_, and\r\nin Homer Folks's _Care of Dependent, Defective, and Delinquent\r\nChildren_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSCHOOL SURGERY AND RELIEF OBJECTIONABLE, IF AVOIDABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular arguments for free meals, free relief, free medical\r\ntreatment at school, are based upon the assumption that there are but\r\ntwo ways to travel, one leading to a physically sound, moral, teachable\r\nchild, the other to an undernourished, subnormal, backward child. They\r\ntell us we must choose either school meals or malnutrition, school\r\neyeglasses or defective vision, free coal or freezing poor, free rent\r\nor people sleeping on the streets, free dental clinics at school or\r\nindigestion and undernourishment, free operation at school for adenoids\r\nor backward, discouraged pupils. If there is no other alternative than\r\nneglect of the child, if we must either waste fifty dollars in giving a\r\nchild education that he is physically unable to take, or pay two,\r\nthree, four, or even fifty dollars to fit him for that education, the\r\nAmerican people will not hesitate. Whether there are other roads to\r\nhealthy children, whether it is cheaper and better for the school to\r\nsee that outside agencies prepare the child for education rather than\r\nitself to take the place of those outside agencies, is a question of\r\nfact, not of theory.\r\n\r\nFacts prove, as we have seen, that there is more than one way to\r\nprevent malnutrition. Parents can be taught to attend to their\r\nchildren; hospitals and dispensaries will furnish eyeglasses where\r\nparents are unable to pay for them; charitable societies will go back\r\nof the need for eyeglasses to the conditions that produce that need and\r\nwill do vastly more for the child than can eyeglasses alone. If\r\nparents, hospitals, dispensaries, and charitable societies will attend\r\nto children's needs, then relief at school is unnecessary, even though\r\nit may seem desirable.\r\n\r\nThe objection to school surgery should be clearly before us, so that we\r\ncan judge of the two methods that are open to us,--_treatment at\r\nschool_ vs. _treatment away from school_.\r\n\r\nSociety is so organized that the treatment of serious physical defects\r\nand social needs at school would upset the machinery a very great deal.\r\nFor the school to do for its children whatever they may need during\r\ntheir school years will require the setting up of a miniature society\r\nin every school building or under every school board. Unless schools\r\nare to equip themselves to take the place of all existing facilities\r\nfor relief and surgery, children would not be so well taken care of as\r\nat present. It should not be forgotten that the physical welfare of the\r\nschool child is the most accurate index to the physical needs of the\r\ncommunity. After all, the child lives for six important years before\r\ncoming to the school and leaves at the early age of fourteen or\r\nfifteen; even while attending school it sleeps at home and is\r\ninfluenced more by home and street standards of ventilation,\r\ncleanliness, and morality than by conditions at school. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, the wider use of the school's influence to use the child's\r\nappeal to strengthen every agency having to do with community health,\r\nrather than to concentrate upon the child himself. If babies were\r\nproperly cared for up to the sixth year, the protection of the school\r\nchild's health would be infinitely easier. To take our eyes from the\r\nchild not yet in school and from the child just out of school is to\r\nmake the mistake that so many advocates of the child labor movement\r\nhave made of going whither and only so far as our interest leads us and\r\nof not continuing until our work is accomplished.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: \"DOING THINGS\" THROUGH MODEL TENEMENTS]\r\n\r\nDo we want to make of our schools miniature hospitals, dispensaries,\r\nrelief bureaus, parks? Or shall we use the momentum of society's\r\ninterest in the school child to put within the reach of every school\r\nbuilding adequate hospitals, dispensaries, relief centers, and parks\r\nfor school child and adult? Shall every little school have its library,\r\nor shall the child be taught at school how to use the same library\r\nthat is available to his parents and older brothers and sisters? If\r\nthe library is to be under the school roof, if dispensary and relief\r\nhospital are to be conducted on the same site as the school, shall they\r\nbe known as dispensary, library, relief bureau, each under separate\r\nmanagement, or shall they be known as school under the management of\r\nschool principal and superintendent? So complicated and many-sided is\r\nthe problem of working together with one's neighbor for mutual benefit\r\nthat it is a safe rule for the schools to adopt: _We shall do nothing\r\nthat is unnecessary or extravagant. We shall have done our part if we\r\ndo well what no one else can do. Whatever any agency can do better than\r\nwe, we shall leave to that agency. Work that another agency ought to\r\nhave done and has left undone, we shall try to have done by that\r\nagency._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE THE MODEL TENEMENTS, BUT\r\n    UNINFLUENCED\r\n    \"Getting things done\" by the Tenement House Department their\r\n    special need]\r\n\r\nI know a hospital where a welfare nurse was recently employed. Within a\r\nfew blocks were three different relief agencies and two\r\nvisiting-nurse's associations, having among them over one hundred\r\nvisitors and nurses going to all sections of Manhattan. This nurse had\r\nthe choice of telephoning to one of these agencies and asking it to\r\ncall at the needy home of one of her hospital patients, or of going to\r\nthe home herself. Had she chosen to use another agency, she could have\r\nbeen the means of furnishing the kind of help needed in every needy\r\nhome discovered in her hospital rounds, but she chose to do the running\r\nabout herself and thus of helping ten families where she ought to have\r\nhelped five hundred. Much the same condition confronts the school that\r\ntries to do all extra work for its child instead of seeing that the\r\nwork is done. Illustration is afforded by the New York tenement\r\ndepartment. Whereas European cities have built a few model tenements,\r\nNew York City secured a law declaring that everybody who built a\r\ntenement and everybody who owned a tenement should provide sanitary\r\nsurroundings. At the present time a philanthropist, by spending two\r\nmillion dollars, could give sanitary surroundings to thirty-five\r\nfamilies; by spending each year the interest on one tenth that sum he\r\ncould insure the enforcement of the tenement laws affecting every\r\ntenement resident in New York City.\r\n\r\nIf schools are to perform surgical operations, they are in danger of\r\nbeing sued for malpractice; discipline will be interfered with.\r\nFinally, let us not forget that we are dealing with buildings,\r\nteachers, and school institutions as they exist. Where education is\r\nmade compulsory, the unpleasant and the controversial should be kept\r\nout of school. Because a democratic institution, the American school\r\nshould represent at all times a maximum of general agreement.\r\n\r\nTo take _palliative measures to public schools_ not only _leaves undone\r\nremedial_ work necessary for the health of public school children but\r\n_neglects entirely the still large numbers who go to parochial, private\r\npay, and private free schools_; no one has had the temerity to suggest\r\nthat the public shall force upon nonpublic schools a system of free\r\noperations, free eyeglasses, free meals.\r\n\r\nCivilization has painstakingly developed a large number of agencies for\r\nthe education and protection of mankind. Of these agencies the school\r\nis but one. Its first and peculiar function is _to teach and to train_.\r\nThis it can do better than any other agency or combination of agencies.\r\nIn attempting to \"bring all life under the school roof,\" we use but a\r\nsmall part of our resources. Instead of persuading each of the agencies\r\nfor the promotion of health to do its part for school children, we set\r\nup the school in competition with them. Thus in trying to _do things_\r\nfor school children we are in danger of crippling agencies equipped to\r\ndo things for both school children and their parents, for babies before\r\nthey come to school, and for wage earners after they leave school.\r\n\r\n_Getting things done_ will lead schools to study underlying causes;\r\n_doing things_ has heretofore caused schools to confine themselves to\r\nsymptoms. _Getting things done_ will leave the school free to\r\nconcentrate its attention upon school problems; _doing things_ will\r\nlead it afield into the problem of medicine, surgery, restaurant\r\nkeeping, and practical charity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION FOR WORKING PAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no sacred right to work when our work involves injury to\r\nourselves and to our neighbor. Work at the expense of health is an\r\nunjustifiable tax upon the state. It is the duty of society to protect\r\nitself against such depletion of national efficiency.\r\n\r\nThree classes of workmen need special attention: (1) those who are\r\nphysically unfit to work; (2) those who are physically unfitted for the\r\nwork they are doing; (3) those who are subjected to unhealthful\r\nsurroundings while at work. Viewing these three classes from the\r\nstandpoint of their neighbors, we have three social rights that should\r\nbe enforced by law: (1) the right to freedom from unhealthy work; (2)\r\nthe right to work fitted to the body; (3) the right to healthy\r\nsurroundings at work.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that just as the sick child may be found at the\r\nhead of his class, so unhealthy men and women are often good business\r\nmanagers, good salesmen, good typewriters, successful capitalists. They\r\nexcel, however, not because of their ill health, but in spite of it,\r\nexcepting of course those instances where men and women, because of ill\r\nhealth, have devoted to business an attention that would have been\r\ngiven to recreation if bad health had not deprived recreation of its\r\npleasure. As statistics in school have proved that the majority of\r\nmentally superior children are also physically superior, so statistics\r\nwill probably prove that the number of the \"sick superior\" among the\r\nworking classes is very small, while the danger of inefficiency that\r\ncomes from physical defect is very great.\r\n\r\nThere is one time in the individual's working life when the state may\r\nproperly step in and demand an inventory of physical resources, and\r\nthat is when the child asks the state for permission to go to work.\r\nStrategically, this is probably the most important of all contact as\r\nyet provided between society and the future wage earner. Here at the\r\nthreshold of his industrial career the boy may be told for what work he\r\nis physically fitted, what physical defects need to be remedied, what\r\nphysical precautions he needs to take, in order to do justice to\r\nhimself and his opportunity.\r\n\r\nEvery year from two to three million children leave the public schools\r\nof this country to join the army of workers. The percentage of those\r\nrecruits who have physical defects needing attention is undoubtedly\r\ngreat; how great we shall never know until the benefits of physical\r\nexamination are given to all of them. What steps is your state taking\r\nto ascertain the physical fitness of the children who present\r\nthemselves each year for working papers? How does it insure itself\r\nagainst the risk of their defective eyesight, chorea, deafness, or\r\ngeneral debility? Does it inform children of their defects, or tell\r\nthem how they may increase their earning power by correcting these\r\ndefects? What effort does it make to induce children to avoid dangerous\r\ntrades, or trades that are particularly dangerous for their physiques?\r\n\r\nAt the close of school last spring I had my secretary look in upon the\r\nNew York board of health and see what demands that city makes upon its\r\nboys and girls before allowing them to drive its machinery, to run its\r\nelevators, to match its colors, to sew on its buttons, to set its type,\r\nto carry its checks to the bank. The officer at the door of the room\r\nwhere the children were being examined, greeted her as follows: \"You\r\nmust bring your child with you; bring his birth certificate or swear\r\nthat he is fourteen years old, and bring a signed statement from his\r\nteacher that he has been in school for one hundred and thirty\r\nconsecutive days within twelve months.\" \"Is there no physical\r\nexamination or test?\" she asked. \"No, no,\" he answered impatiently. Yet\r\nthe board of health certifies that \"said child has in our opinion\r\nreached the normal development of a child of its age, and is in sound\r\nhealth and is physically able to perform the work which it intends to\r\ndo.\" In addition the blank calls for place and date of birth, color of\r\nhair and of eyes, height, weight, and facial marks. Volunteer societies\r\nin practically every state in the Union have been working for years to\r\nhave it made a criminal offense to employ a child who has not been in\r\nschool a minimum of days after a stated age (12, 13, 14, 15). Even in\r\nNew York, however, the center of this agitation, no strong demand was\r\nmade upon the board of health to apply a physical-fitness test as well\r\nas an age test until 1908 when examination for working papers was added\r\nto the programme for child hygiene. Yet who does not know girls and\r\nboys of sixteen less fit for factory or shop work than other boys and\r\ngirls of twelve? It is the fetich of age which has made possible the\r\n\"democracy\" that permits a child of fourteen to work all day on\r\ncondition that he go to school at night!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHILDREN ENLISTING IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARMY]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WAITING TO BE EXAMINED FOR WORKING PAPERS\r\n    An excellent opportunity for physical-fitness tests]\r\n\r\nSo great is the risk of defective, sickly, or intemperate employees,\r\nthat in some trades employers take every precaution to exclude them.\r\nOne man with defective eyesight or unsteady nerves may cost a railroad\r\nthousands of dollars. As insurance companies rank trades as first-,\r\nsecond-, or third-class risks, so many factories, from long experience,\r\ndebar men with certain characteristics which have been found\r\ndetrimental to business. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company of New\r\nYork City examines all applicants for employment, as to age, weight,\r\nheight, keenness of vision, hearing, color perception, lungs, hearts,\r\narteries, alcoholism, and nicotinism. Those who fall below the standard\r\nare rejected, but in each case the physical condition is explained to\r\nthe applicant. Where defects are removable or correctable, the\r\napplicant is told what to do and invited to take another test after\r\ntreatment. Moreover, accepted employees are periodically reexamined.\r\nWhile designed to increase company profits and to reduce company\r\nlosses, this examination obviously decreases the employees' losses\r\nalso, and increases the certainty of work and prospect of promotion.\r\n\r\nOur states, and many of our industries, still have the attitude of a\r\ncertain manufacturer who employs several hundred boys and girls. I\r\nasked him what tests he employed. \"I look over a long line of the\r\napplicants and say,\" pointing his finger, \"I want you, and you, and\r\nyou; the rest may go.\" I asked him if he made a point of picking out\r\nthose who looked strong. \"No. The work is easy, sitting down all day\r\nlong and picking over things. I select those whose faces I like. Yes,\r\nthere is one question we now ask of all the girls. One day a girl in\r\nthe workroom had an epileptic fit and it frightened everybody and upset\r\nthe work so that the foreman always asks, 'Do you have fits? Because if\r\nyou do, you can't work here.'\" He makes no attempt to determine the\r\nphysical fitness and endurance of the children employed, because when\r\nthe strength of one is spent there is always another to step into her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBecause the apprentice's future is of no value to the manufacturer, the\r\nstate must restrict the manufacturer's freedom to spend like water\r\nsociety's capital,--the health of the coming generation. Could there be\r\na grosser mis-management of society's business than to permit trade to\r\nwaste children on whose education society spends so many millions\r\nyearly? The most effective and most timely remedy is physical\r\nexamination as a condition of the work certificate. A simple, easily\r\napplied, inexpensive measure that imposes only a legitimate restriction\r\nupon individual freedom, it is absolutely necessary in order to get to\r\nthe bottom of the child labor problem. If thoroughly applied, children\r\nof the nation will no longer be exploited by unscrupulous or\r\nindifferent employers, nor will their health be hazarded by lack of\r\ndiscriminating examination that rejects the obviously sick and favors\r\nthe apparently robust. Furthermore, knowledge that this test will be\r\napplied when work certificates are required, will be an incentive to\r\nthe school boy and girl to keep well. Tell a boy that adenoids or weak\r\nlungs will keep him from getting a job, and you will make him a strong\r\nadvocate of operation and of fresh air. Show him that his employers\r\nwill not wish his services when his week is out if he is physically\r\nbelow par, and he will gladly submit to a board of health examination\r\nand ask to be told what his defects are and how to correct them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHILDREN AT WORK BELOW BOTH AGE LIMIT AND\r\n    VITALITY LIMIT\r\n    National Child Labor Committee]\r\n\r\nSome there are who will object to this appeal to the child's economic\r\ninstinct. This objection does not remove the instinct. The normal child\r\nis greedy for a job. His greed, as well as that of the manufacturer and\r\nparent, is responsible for much of the child labor; his greed for\r\nactivity, for association, for money, and so for work. A little boy\r\ncame into my office and wanted to hire as an office boy. I looked at\r\nhim and said: \"My little fellow, you ought to be in school. What do you\r\nwant to hire out here for?\" He said, \"I am tired of school; nothing\r\ndoing.\" He doesn't care about work for its own sake; he doesn't care\r\nabout wealth for its own sake; he wants to get into life; to be where\r\nthere is \"something doing.\" In this lies one potent argument for\r\nvocational training. To tell a boy of his physical needs just before he\r\nhas taken his first business step is to put him everlastingly in our\r\ndebt. Then he is responsive, and, fortunately for the extreme cases,\r\nnecessarily dependent, for he knows that his refusal would stand\r\nbetween himself and his ambition.\r\n\r\nWhen boys and girls go for work certificates to Dr. Goler, medical\r\nofficer of health at Rochester, he requires not merely evidence of age\r\nand of schooling, but examines their eyes for defective vision and for\r\ndisease, their teeth for cavities and unhealthy gums, and their noses\r\nand throats for adenoids and enlarged tonsils. If a boy has sixteen\r\ndecayed teeth, Dr. Goler explains to him that teeth are meant to be not\r\nonly ornaments and conveniences, but money getters as well. The boy\r\nlearns that decayed teeth breed disease, contaminate food, interfere\r\nwith digestion, make him a disagreeable companion and a less efficient\r\nworker. If he will go and have them put into proper condition he will\r\nenjoy life better and earn good wages sooner. After the teeth are\r\nattended to the boy secures his work certificate. If the boy's mother\r\nprotests in tears or in anger that her boy does not work with his\r\nteeth, she learns what she never learned at school, that sound teeth\r\nhelp pay the rent. If a girl applicant for working papers has adenoids,\r\nshe is asked to look in the mirror and to notice how her lips fail to\r\nmeet, how the lower jaw drops, how much better she looks with her jaws\r\nand lips together. She is told that other people breathe through the\r\nnose, and that perhaps the reason she dislikes school and does not feel\r\nas she used to about play is that she cannot breathe through her nose\r\nas she used to. She is shown that her nose is stopped up by a spongy\r\nsubstance, as big as the end of her little finger, which obstruction\r\ncan be easily removed. She is shown adenoids and enlarged tonsils that\r\nhave been removed from some other girl, and is so impressed with the\r\nbefore-operation and after-operation contrast and by the story of the\r\nother girl's rapid increase in wages, that she and her mother both\r\ndecide not to wait for the adenoids to disappear by absorption. After\r\nthe operation they come back with proof that the trouble is gone, and\r\nget the \"papers.\" Similar instruction is given when defects of vision\r\nseriously interfere with a child's prospects of getting ahead in his\r\nwork, or when evidence of incipient tuberculosis makes it criminal to\r\nput a child in a store or factory.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE GRENFELL ASSOCIATION FINDS MOUTH BREATHERS AT\r\n    WORK IN LABRADOR]\r\n\r\nNo law as yet authorizes the health officer of Rochester to refuse work\r\ncertificates to children physically unfit to become wage earners. A\r\nhigher law than that which any legislature can pass or revoke, has\r\ngiven Dr. Goler power over children and parents, namely, interest in\r\nchildren and knowledge of the industrial handicap that results from\r\nphysical defects. This higher law authorizes every health officer in\r\nthe United States to examine the school child before issuing a work\r\ncertificate, to tell the child and his parents what defects need to be\r\nremoved, for what trades he is physically unfitted, what trades will\r\nnot increase his physical weakness, and to what trade he is physically\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that a large proportion of our children never\r\napply for work certificates; some because they never intend to work;\r\nsome because they expect to remain in school until sixteen or later;\r\nsome because they live on farms, in small towns, or in cities and\r\nstates where prohibition of child labor is not enforced. Because there\r\nis no reason for this large proportion of children to visit a board of\r\nhealth, some substitute must be found. This substitute has been already\r\nsuggested by principals and district superintendents in New York City,\r\nwho claim that the natural place for the examination of children is the\r\nschool and not health headquarters. Developing the idea that the school\r\nshould pronounce the child's fitness to leave school and to engage in\r\nwork, we are led to the suggestion that the state, which compels\r\nevidence that every child, rich or poor, is being taught during the\r\ncompulsory school age, shall also at the age of fourteen or sixteen\r\nrequire evidence that the child is physically fit to use his education,\r\nand that it shall not, because of preventable ill health, prove a\r\nlosing investment.\r\n\r\nParochial and private schools, the ultra-religious and ultra-rich, may\r\nresent for a time public supervision of the physical condition of\r\nchildren who do not ask for work certificates. This position will be\r\nshort-lived, because however much we may disagree about society's right\r\nto control a child's act after his physical defects are discovered, few\r\nof us will question the state's duty to tell that child and his\r\nparents the truth about his physical needs before it accepts his labor\r\nor permits him to go to college, to \"come out,\" to \"enter society,\" or\r\nto live on an income provided by others. Thus an invaluable\r\ncommencement present can be given by the state to children in country\r\nschools and to those compelled to drop out of fourth or fifth grades of\r\ncity schools.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S CLINICAL CARE AND HOME\r\n    INSTRUCTION COME AFTER WAGE LOSSES, WHILE WORK CERTIFICATES\r\n    PRECEDE BREAKDOWNS FROM TUBERCULOSIS]\r\n\r\nA brief test of this method of helping children, such as is now being\r\nmade by several boards of health at the instance of the National Bureau\r\nof Labor, will prove conclusively that parents are grateful for the\r\ntimely discovery of these defects which handicap because of their\r\nexistence, not because of their discovery. Of the cadets preparing for\r\nwar at West Point, it has recently been decided that those \"who in the\r\nphysical examinations are found to have deteriorated below the\r\nprescribed physical standard will be dropped from the rolls of the\r\nacademy.\" Shall not cadets preparing for an industrial life and\r\ncitizenship be given at least a knowledge of an adequate physical\r\nstandard? To allow the school child to deteriorate whether before or\r\nafter going to work is only to waste potential citizenship. Citizens\r\nwho use themselves up in the mere getting of a living have no surplus\r\nstrength or interest for overcoming incompetence in civic business, or\r\nfor achieving the highest aim of citizenship,--the art of\r\nself-government for the benefit of all the governed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nPERIODICAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AFTER SCHOOL AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Hughes, in his address to the students in Gettysburg College,\r\npleaded for such lives that strength would be left for the years of\r\nachievement. How many men and women can you count who are squandering\r\ntheir health bank account? How many do you know who are now physically\r\nbankrupt? The man who is prodigal of his health may work along all\r\nright for years, never realizing until the test comes that he is\r\nrunning behind in his vitality. The test may be hard times, promotion,\r\nexposure to cold, heat, fever, or a sudden call for all his control in\r\navoiding accident. If his vitality fails to stand the test, his career\r\nmay be ruined, \"all for the want of a horseshoe nail\": because of no\r\nhealth bank account to draw upon in time of need,--failure; because of\r\nvitality depleted by alcohol, tobacco, overeating, underexercise, or\r\ntoo little sleep,--no power to resist contagious diseases; because of\r\nignorance of existing lung trouble,--a year or more of idleness,\r\nperhaps poverty for his family; or there is neglected ear or eye\r\ntrouble,--and thousands of lives may be lost because the engineer\r\nfailed to read the signals.\r\n\r\nAdults are now examined when applying for insurance or accident\r\npolicies, for work on railroads, for service in the army and on the\r\npolice and fire forces of cities that provide pensions. It is somewhat\r\nsurprising that the hundreds of thousands who carry life insurance\r\npolicies have not realized that a test which is rigorously imposed for\r\nbusiness reasons by insurance companies can be applied by individuals\r\nfor business reasons. Generations hence the state will probably\r\nrequire of every person periodic physical examination after school age.\r\nDecades hence business enterprises will undoubtedly require evidence of\r\nhealth and vitality from employees before and during employment, just\r\nas schools will require such evidence from teachers. It is, after all,\r\nbut a step from the police passport to the health passport. Why should\r\nwe not protect ourselves against enemies to health and efficiency as\r\nwell as against enemies to order? But for the present we must rely upon\r\nthe intelligence of individuals to recognize the advantage to\r\nthemselves, their families, and their employers, of knowing that their\r\nbodies do not harbor hidden enemies of vitality and efficiency. From a\r\nsemi-annual examination of teeth to a semi-annual physical examination\r\nis but a short step when once its effectiveness is seen by a few in\r\neach community.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE OLD SOUTHFIELD, NOW ANCHORED AT BELLEVUE\r\n    HOSPITAL'S DOCK, NEW YORK CITY, GIVES DAILY LESSONS IN THE\r\n    PREVENTABLE TAX LEVIED BY TUBERCULOSIS]\r\n\r\nIgnorance of one's physical condition is a luxury no one can afford. No\r\nsociety is rich enough to afford members ignorant of physical\r\nweaknesses prejudicial to others' health and efficiency. Every one of\r\nus, even though to all appearances physically normal, needs the\r\nbiological engineer. New conditions come upon us with terrific\r\nrapidity. The rush of work, noise, dust, heat, and overcrowding of\r\nmodern industry make it important to have positive evidence that we\r\nhave successfully adapted ourselves to these new conditions. Only by\r\nmeasuring the effects of these environmental forces upon our bodies can\r\nwe prevent some trifling physical flaw from developing into a chronic\r\nor acute condition. As labor becomes more and more highly specialized,\r\nthe body of the laborer is forced to readapt itself. The kind of work a\r\nman does determines which organs shall claim more than their share of\r\nblood and energy. The man who sets type develops keenness of vision and\r\nmanual dexterity. The stoker develops the muscles of his arms and back,\r\nthe engineer alertness of eye and ear. All sorts of devices have been\r\ninvented to aid this specialization of particular organs, as well as to\r\ncorrect their imperfections: the magnifying glass, the telescope, the\r\nmicroscope, extend the powers of the eye; the spectacle or an operation\r\non the eye muscles enables the defective eye to do normal work. A man\r\nwith astigmatism might be a policeman all his life, win promotion, and\r\ndie ignorant of his defect; whereas if the same man had become a\r\nchauffeur, he might have killed himself and his employer the first\r\nyear, or, if an accountant, he might have been a chronic dyspeptic from\r\nlong-continued eye strain. It is a soul tragedy for a man to attempt a\r\ncareer for which he is physically unadapted.[11] It is a social tragedy\r\nwhen men and women squander their health. A great deal of the success\r\nattributed to luck and opportunity, or unusual mental endowment, is in\r\nreality due to a chance compatibility of work with physique. To secure\r\nsuch compatibility is the purpose of physical examination after school\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIf the periodic visit to the doctor is the first law of adult health,\r\nstill more imperative is the law that competent physicians should be\r\nseen at the first indication of ill health. Even when competent\r\nphysicians are at hand, parents and teachers should be taught what\r\nwarning signs may mean and what steps should be taken. In Germany\r\ninsurance companies find that it saves money to provide free medical\r\nand dental care for the insured. Department stores, many factories and\r\nrailroads, have learned from experience that they save money by\r\ninducing their employees to consult skilled physicians at the first\r\nsign of physical disorder. Many colleges, schools, and \"homes\" have a\r\nresident physician. Wherever any large number of people are assembled\r\ntogether,--in a hotel, factory, store, ship, college, or school,--there\r\nshould be an efficient consulting physician at hand. If people are\r\nneedlessly alarmed, it is of the utmost importance to show them that\r\nthere is nothing seriously wrong. Therefore visits to the consulting\r\nphysician should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe reader's observation will suggest numerous illustrations of pain,\r\nprolonged sickness, loss of life, that could have been prevented had\r\nthe physician been semi-annually visited. A strong man, well educated,\r\nwith large income, personally acquainted with several of the foremost\r\nphysicians of New York City, after suffering two weeks from pains \"that\r\nwould pass away,\" was hurriedly taken to a hospital at three o'clock in\r\nthe morning, operated upon immediately, and died at nine. A business\r\nman of means put off going to a physician for fifteen years, for fear\r\nhe would be told that his throat trouble was tobacco cancer, or\r\nincipient tuberculosis, or asthma; a physical examination showed that a\r\ndifficulty of breathing and chronic throat trouble were due to a\r\ngrowth in the nose, corrected in a few minutes by operation.\r\n\r\nA celebrated economist was forced to give up academic work, and\r\nconsecrated his life to painful and chronic dyspepsia because of eye\r\ntrouble detected upon the first physical examination. A woman secretary\r\nsuffered from alleged heart trouble; paralysis threatened, continuous\r\nheadache and blurred vision forced her to give up work and income; a\r\nphysical examination found the cause in nasal growths, whose removal\r\nrestored normal conditions. A woman lecturer on children's health heard\r\ndescribed last summer a friend's experience with receding gums: \"'Why,\r\nI never heard of that disease.' she said. 'Don't you know you have it\r\nyourself'? I asked. She had never noticed that her gums were growing\r\naway in little points on her front teeth. I touched the uncovered\r\nportion and she winced. That ignorance has meant intense pain and ugly\r\nfillings. If it had gone longer, it might have meant the loss of her\r\nfront teeth.\" A teacher lost a month from nervous prostration; physical\r\nexamination would have discovered the eye trouble that deranged the\r\nstomach and produced the nerve-racking shingles which forced him to\r\ntake a month's vacation. A journalist lost weeks each year because of\r\nstrained ankles; since being told that he had flat foot, and that the\r\narch of his foot could be strengthened by braces and specially made\r\nshoes, he has not lost a minute. A relief visitor, ardent advocate of\r\nthe fresh-air, pure-milk treatment for tuberculosis, had a \"little\r\ncough\" and an occasional \"cold sweat\"; medical friends knew this, but\r\nhumored her aversion to examination; when too late, she submitted to an\r\nexamination and to the treatment which, if taken earlier, would most\r\ncertainly have cured her. A mother's sickness cost a wage-earning\r\ndaughter nearly $3000; softening of the brain was feared; after six\r\nyears of suffering and unnecessary expense, physical examination\r\ndisclosed an easily removable cause, and for two years she has\r\ncontributed to the family income instead of exhausting it. Untold\r\nsuffering is saved many a mother by knowledge of her special physical\r\nneed in advance of her baby's birth. Untold suffering might be saved\r\nmany a woman in business if she could be told in what respects she was\r\ntransgressing Nature's law.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEW YORK CITY'S TUBERCULOSIS SANATORIUM AT\r\n    OTISVILLE IS SENDING HOME APOSTLES OF SEMI-ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BOSTON'S PICTURESQUE DAY CAMP FOR TUBERCULOSIS\r\n    PATIENTS IS TEACHING THE NEED FOR A PERIODIC INVENTORY OF\r\n    PHYSICAL RESOURCES]\r\n\r\nTo encourage periodic physical examination is not to encourage morbid\r\nthinking of disease. One reason for our tardiness in recognizing the\r\nneed for thorough physical examination is the doctor's tradition of\r\ntreating symptoms. After men and women are intelligent enough to demand\r\nan inventory of their physical resources,--a balance sheet of their\r\nphysical assets and liabilities,--physicians will study the whole man\r\nand not the fraction of a man in which they happen to be specializing\r\nor about which the patient worries. By removing the mystery of bodily\r\nailments and by familiarizing ourselves with the essentials to healthy\r\nliving, we find protection against charlatans, quacks, faddists, and\r\nexperimenters. By taking a periodic inventory of our physical resources\r\nwe discharge a sacred obligation of citizenship.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] See _Dangerous Trades_, compiled by Thomas Oliver; also list of\r\nreports by the United States Bureau of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nHABITS OF HEALTH PROMOTE INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation's highest aim is to train us to do the right thing at the\r\nright moment without having to think. The technic of musician,\r\nstenographer, artist, electrician, surgeon, orator, is gained only from\r\npatient training of the body's reflex muscles to do brain work.[12] The\r\nlower nerve centers are storehouses for the brain energy, just as\r\ncentral power houses are used for storing electric energy to be spent\r\nupon demand. From habit, not from mental effort, we turn to the right,\r\nsay \"I beg pardon\" when we step on another's foot, give our seats to\r\nladies or to elderly persons, use acceptable table manners. No person\r\nseems \"to the manner born\" who has to think out each act necessary to\r\n\"company manners.\" How numerous are the mental and physical processes\r\nessential to good manners no one ever recognizes but the very bashful\r\nor the uncouth person trying to cultivate habits of unconsciousness in\r\npolite society. The habit of living ethically enables us to go through\r\nlife without being tempted to steal or lie or do physical violence. No\r\nperson's morals can be relied upon who is tempted constantly to do\r\nimmoral acts; ethical training seeks to incapacitate us for committing\r\nunethical deeds and to habituate us to ethical acts alone.\r\n\r\nEight different elements of industrial efficiency are concerned with\r\nthe individual's health habits,--the industrial worker, his industrial\r\nproduct, his employer, his employer's profit, his trade or profession,\r\nits product, his nation, national product. Obviously few men have so\r\nlittle to do that they have time to think out in detail how this act or\r\nthat indulgence will affect each of these eight factors of industrial\r\nefficiency. Once convinced, however, that all of these elements are\r\neither helped or injured by the individual's method of living, each one\r\nof us has a strong reason for imposing habits of health upon all\r\nindustries, upon employees and operatives, upon all who are a part of\r\nindustrial efficiency. When these eight relations are seen, parents and\r\nteachers have particularly strong reasons for inculcating habits of\r\nhealth in their children.\r\n\r\nThat industrial inefficiency results from chronic habits of unhealthy\r\nliving is generally recognized. The alcoholic furnishes the most vivid\r\nillustration. The penalties suffered by him and his family are grave\r\nenough, but because he has not full possession of his faculties he is\r\nunpunctual, wastes material, disobeys instructions, endangers others'\r\nlives, decreases the product of his trade and of his employer, lessens\r\nthe profits of both, depresses wages, increases insurance and business\r\nrisks. Because no one can foresee when the \"drop too much\" will be\r\ntaken, industry finds it important to know that the habit of drinking\r\nalcoholics moderately has not been acquired by train dispatcher,\r\nengineer, switchman, chauffeur. Because the habit of drinking\r\nmoderately is apt, among lower incomes, to go hand in hand with other\r\nhabits injurious to business and fatal to integrity, positions of trust\r\nin industry seek men and women who have the habit of declining drink.\r\n\r\nIn the aggregate, milder forms of unhealthy living interfere with\r\nindustrial efficiency even more than alcoholism. Many capable men and\r\nwomen, even those who have had thorough technical training, fail to win\r\npromotion because their persons are not clean, their breath offensive,\r\ntheir clothes suggestive of disorderly, uncleanly habits. Persons of\r\nextraordinary capacity not infrequently achieve only mediocre results\r\nbecause they fail to cultivate habits of cleanliness and health. An\r\nemployer can easily protect his business from loss due to alcoholism\r\namong his own employees; but loss through employees' constipation,\r\nheadache, bad ventilation at home, irregular meals, improper diet, too\r\nmany night parties, nicotinism, personal uncleanliness, is loss much\r\nharder to anticipate and avoid. Because evil results are less vivid, it\r\nis also hard to convince a clerk that intemperance in eating, sleeping,\r\nand playing will interfere with his earning capacity and his enjoyment\r\ncapacity quite as surely as intemperance in the use of alcohol and\r\nnicotine. Where employees are paid by the piece, instead of by the\r\nhour, day, or week, the employer partially protects himself against\r\nuneven, sluggish, slipshod workmen; but, other things being equal, he\r\nawards promotion to those who are most regular and who are most often\r\nat their best, for he finds that the man who does not \"slump\" earns\r\nbest profits and deserves highest pay.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THESE PATIENTS ON THE OLD SOUTHFIELD ARE TAXING\r\n    THEIR UNIONS AND THEIR TRADES AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES AND THE\r\n    TUBERCULOSIS COMMITTEE]\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions, it is true, where both industrial promotion and\r\nindustrial efficiency are won by people who violate laws of\r\nhealth,--but at what cost to their efficiency? Your efficiency should\r\nbe measured not by some other person's advancement, but by what you\r\nyourself ought to accomplish; while the effect of abusing your physical\r\nstrength is shown not only in the shortening of your industrial life\r\nand in the diminishing returns from your labor, but by the decrease of\r\nnational and trade efficiency. \"Sweating\" injures those who buy and\r\nthose in the same trade who are not \"sweated\" just as truly as it\r\ninjures the \"sweated.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HABITS OF HEALTH AMONG DAIRYMEN MEAN SAFE MILK\r\n    FOR BABIES]\r\n\r\nWhat are the health habits that should become instinctive and\r\neffortless for every worker? What acts can we make our lower nerve\r\ncenters--our subconscious selves--do for us or remind us to do? The\r\nfollowing constitutes a daily routine that should be as involuntary as\r\nthe process of digestion:\r\n\r\n  1. Throw the bedding over the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n  2. Close the window that has been open during the night.\r\n\r\n  3. Drink a glass of water.\r\n\r\n  4. Bathe the face, neck, crotch, chest, armpits (finishing if not\r\n  beginning with cold water), and particularly the eyes, ears, and\r\n  nose. If time and conveniences permit, bathe all over.\r\n\r\n  5. Cleanse the finger nails.\r\n\r\n  6. Cleanse the teeth, especially the places that are out of sight\r\n  and hard to reach.\r\n\r\n  7. Breakfast punctually at a regular hour. Eat lightly and only\r\n  what agrees with you. If you read a morning paper, be interested\r\n  in news items that have to do with personal and community\r\n  vitality.\r\n\r\n  8. Visit the toilet; if impracticable at home, have a regular time\r\n  at business.\r\n\r\n  9. Have several minutes in the open air, preferably walking.\r\n\r\n  10. Be punctual at work.\r\n\r\n  11. As your right by contract, insist upon a supply of fresh air\r\n  for your workroom with the same emphasis you use in demanding\r\n  sufficient heat in zero weather.\r\n\r\n  12. Eat punctually at noon intermission; enjoy your meal and its\r\n  after effects.\r\n\r\n  13. Breathe air out of doors a few minutes, preferably walking.\r\n\r\n  14. Resume business punctually.\r\n\r\n  15. Stop work regularly.\r\n\r\n  16. Take out-of-door exercise--indoor only when fresh air is\r\n  possible--that you enjoy and that agrees with you.\r\n\r\n  17. Be regular, temperate, and leisurely in eating the evening\r\n  meal; eat nothing that disagrees with you.\r\n\r\n  18. Spend the evening profitably and pleasantly and in ways\r\n  compatible with the foregoing habits.\r\n\r\n  19. Retire regularly at a fixed hour, making up for irregularity\r\n  by an earlier hour next night.\r\n\r\n  20, 21, 22. Repeat 4, 6, 8.\r\n\r\n  23. Turn underclothes wrong side out for ventilation.\r\n\r\n  24. Open windows.\r\n\r\n  25. Relax mind and body and go to sleep.\r\n\r\nNo man chronically neglects any one of the above rules without reducing\r\nhis industrial efficiency. No man chronically neglects all of them\r\nwithout becoming, sooner or later, a health bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this daily routine, there are certain other acts that\r\nshould become habitual:\r\n\r\n  1. Bathing less frequently than once a week is almost as dangerous\r\n  to health as it is to attractiveness.\r\n\r\n  2. Distaste for unclean linen or undergarments and for acts or\r\n  foods that interfere with vitality should become instinctive.\r\n\r\n  3. Excesses in eating or playing should be automatically corrected\r\n  the next day and the next. Parties we shall continue to have. It\r\n  will be some time before reasonable hours and reasonable\r\n  refreshments will prevail. Meanwhile it is probably better for an\r\n  individual to sacrifice somewhat his own vitality for the sake of\r\n  the union, the class, or the church. While trying to improve group\r\n  habits, one can acquire the habit of not eating three meals in\r\n  one, of eating less next day, of sleeping longer next night, of\r\n  being particularly careful to have plenty of outdoor air.\r\n\r\n  4. Visits to the dentist twice a year at least, and whenever a\r\n  cavity appears, even if only a week after the dentist has failed\r\n  to find one; whenever the gums begin to recede; and whenever\r\n  anything seems to be wrong with the teeth.\r\n\r\n  5. Periodic physical examination by a physician.\r\n\r\n  6. Examination by a competent physician whenever any disorder\r\n  cannot be satisfactorily explained by violation of the daily\r\n  routine or by interruption of business or domestic routine.\r\n\r\nHealth habits do not become instinctive until a continued, conscious\r\neffort is made to accustom the body to them. When this is once done,\r\nhowever, the body not only attends to its primary health needs\r\nautomatically, but it rebels at their omission, as surely as does the\r\nstomach at the omission of dinner. Witness the discomfort of the\r\nconsumptive, trained to fresh air at a sanatorium, when he returns to\r\nhis overheated and underventilated home, or the actual pain experienced\r\nin readjusting our own healthy bodies to the stuffy workroom or\r\nschoolroom after a summer vacation out of doors. I heard a consumptive\r\nsay that he left a sanatorium for a day class after trying for three\r\nnights to sleep in an unventilated ward. For many people the regular\r\nmorning bath is at first a trial, then a pleasure, and finally a need;\r\nif omitted, the body feels thirsty and dissatisfied, the eyes sleepy,\r\nand the spirit flags early in the day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IMPROVISED SEASIDE HOSPITAL FOR NONPULMONARY\r\n    TUBERCULOSIS AT SEA BREEZE TEACHES PASSERS-BY THE FRESH-AIR\r\n    GOSPEL]\r\n\r\nCold baths are not essential or even good for everybody. The same diet\r\nor the same amount of food or time for eating is not of equal value for\r\nall. The temperature of bath water, the kind and quality of food, are\r\ninfluenced by one's work and one's cook. Set rules about these things\r\ndo more harm than good. Such questions must be decided for each\r\nindividual,--by his experience or by the advice of a physician,--but\r\nthey must be decided and the decisions converted into health habits if\r\nhe would attain the highest efficiency of which he is capable. Here\r\nagain our old contrast between \"doing things\" and \"getting things done\"\r\napplies. Get your body to attend to the essential needs for you, and\r\nget it to remind you when you let the exigencies of life interfere.\r\nDon't burden your mind every day with work that your body will do for\r\nyou if properly trained.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CRIPPLED CHILDREN LEAVING SEA BREEZE HOSPITAL FOR\r\n    BONE TUBERCULOSIS FIND STALE AIR OFFENSIVE BY NIGHT OR BY DAY]\r\n\r\nObstacles to habits of health are numerous; therefore the importance of\r\ncorrecting those habits of factory, family, trade, city, or nation that\r\nmake health habits impracticable. We must change others' prejudices\r\nbefore we can breathe clean air on street cars without riding outside.\r\nWhen one's co-workers are afraid of fresh air, ventilation of shop,\r\nstore, and office is impossible. So long as parents fear night air,\r\nchildren cannot follow advice to sleep with windows open. Unless the\r\nfamily cooeperates in making definite plans for the use of toilet and\r\nbath for each member, constipation and bad circulation are sure to\r\nresult. Indigestion is inevitable if employees are not given lunch\r\nperiods and closing hours that permit of regular, unhurried meals.\r\nCleanliness of person costs more than it seems to be worth where cities\r\nfail either to compel bath tubs in rented apartments or to erect public\r\nbaths. A temperate subsistence on adulterated, poisonous, or drugged\r\nfoods might be better for one's health than gormandizing on pure foods.\r\nNo recipe has ever been found for bringing up a healthy baby on\r\nunclean, infected milk; for avoiding tuberculosis among people who are\r\ncompelled to work with careless consumptives in unclean air; or for\r\nmaking a five-story leap as safe as a fire escape. Perfect habits of\r\nhealth on the part of an individual will not protect him against\r\nenervation or infection resulting from inefficient enforcement of\r\nsanitary codes by city, county, state, and national authorities.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: AT JUNIOR SEA BREEZE, TEACHING MOTHERS THE HEALTH\r\n    ROUTINE FOR BABIES]\r\n\r\nThe \"municipalization\" or \"public subsidy\" of health habits is\r\nindispensable to protecting industrial efficiency. Public lavatories,\r\nabove or below ground, have done much to reduce inefficiency due to\r\nalcoholism, constipation of the bowels, and congestion of the kidneys.\r\nTheaters, churches, and assembly rooms could be built so as to drill\r\naudiences in habits of health instead of fixing habits of uncleanly\r\nbreathing. Street flushing, drinking fountains, parks and breathing\r\nspaces, playgrounds and outdoor gymnasiums, milk, food, and drug\r\ninspection, tenement, factory, and shop supervision, enforcement of\r\nanti-spitting penalties, restriction of hours of labor, prohibition of\r\nchild labor,--these inculcate community habits of health that promote\r\ncommunity efficiency. It is the duty of health boards to compel all\r\ncitizens under their jurisdiction to cultivate habits of health and to\r\npunish all who persistently refuse to acquire these habits, so far as\r\nthe evils of neglect become apparent to health authorities. The\r\nunlimited educational opportunity of health boards consists in their\r\nprivilege to point out repeatedly and cumulatively the industrial and\r\ncommunity benefits that result from habits of health, and the\r\nindustrial and community losses that result from habits of unhealthy\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Serviceable guides to personal habits of health are _Aristocracy of\r\nHealth_ by Mary Foote Henderson, and _Efficient Life_ by Dr. Luther H.\r\nGulick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL HYGIENE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo call the movement for better factory conditions the \"humanizing of\r\nindustry\" implies that modern industry not influenced by that movement\r\nis brutalized. The brutalizing of industry was due chiefly to a general\r\nignorance of health laws,--an ignorance that registers itself clearly\r\nand promptly in factory and mine. It is not that a man is expected to\r\ndo too much, but that too little is expected of the human body. The\r\npresent recognition of the body's right to vitality is not because the\r\nemployer's heart is growing warmer, or because competition is less\r\nvicious, but because the precepts of hygiene are found to be practical.\r\nWhere better ventilation used to mean more windows and repair bills, it\r\nnow means greater output. Where formerly a comfortable place in which\r\nto eat lunch meant giving up a workroom and its profits, it now means\r\n25 per cent more work done in all workrooms during the afternoon. The\r\ngeneral enlightenment as to industrial hygiene has been accelerated by\r\nthe awakening that always follows industrial catastrophes, by the\r\nsplendid crusade against tuberculosis, and by compulsory notification\r\nand treatment of communicable diseases.\r\n\r\nCatastrophes, however, have dominated the vocabulary that describes\r\nfactory \"welfare work.\" Because accidents such as gas in mines, fire in\r\nfactories, fever in towns, and epidemics of diseases incident to\r\ncertain trades were beyond the power of the workers themselves to\r\ncontrol or prevent, wage earners have come to be looked upon as\r\nhelpless victims of the cupidity and inhumanity of their employers.\r\nThis attitude has weakened the usefulness of many bodies organized to\r\npromote industrial hygiene. Although the term \"industrial hygiene\" is\r\nbroad enough to include all sanitary and hygienic conditions that\r\nsurround the worker while at work, it is restricted by some to the\r\nefforts made by altruistic or farsighted employers in the interest of\r\nemployees; others think of prohibitions and mandates, in the name of\r\nthe state, that either prevent certain evils or compel certain\r\nbenefits; for too few it refers to what the wage earner does for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nPity for the employee has caused the motive power of the employee to be\r\nwastefully allowed to atrophy. Yet when a man becomes an employee, he\r\ndoes not forfeit any right of citizenship, nor does being an employee\r\nrelieve him from the duties of citizenship. In too many cases it has\r\nbeen overlooked that a worker's carelessness about habits of health, as\r\nwell as about his machinery, causes accidents and increases industrial\r\ndiseases. Too often the worker himself is responsible for uncleanliness\r\nand lack of ventilation and his own consequent lack of vitality. A\r\nstudy into the conditions of ventilation and cleanliness of workers'\r\nhomes will prove this.\r\n\r\nKnowing that a light, well-aired, clean, safe factory would not of\r\nitself insure healthy men, many employers have built and supplied\r\nhouses for their workmen at low rents. Just as these employers failed\r\nto see that they could reach more people and secure more permanent\r\nresults if they demanded that tenement laws and the sanitary code be\r\nenforced as well as the laws for the instruction of children in\r\nhygiene, so the employee has failed to see that he is a part of the\r\npublic that passes laws and determines the efficiency of factory\r\ninspection. The enforcement of state legislation for working hours,\r\nproper water and milk supply, proper teaching of children, proper\r\ntenement conditions, efficient health administration, is dependent upon\r\nthe interest and activity of the public, of which the working class is\r\nno small or uninfluential part.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COUNTRY CLUB HOUSE FOR NEW YORK SOCIAL WORKERS\r\n    Given by the founder of Caroline Rest Educational Fund]\r\n\r\nThe first and most important step in securing hygienic rights for\r\nworkingmen is to make sure that they know the rights that the law\r\nalready gives them. Men still throw out their chests when talking of\r\ntheir rights. The posting of the game laws in a club last summer, and\r\nthe instruction of all the natives of the countryside in regard to\r\ntheir rights as against those of outsiders, meant that for the first\r\ntime in their history the game laws were enforced. All the natives,\r\ninstead of poaching as has been their wont, joined together in\r\nprotecting club property from intruding outside sportsmen. Poachers\r\nwere caught and served with the full penalties of the law. Over winter\r\nfires these people's heroism will grow, but their respect for law will\r\ngrow also, and it is doubtful if the game laws can be violated in that\r\nsection so long as the tradition of this summer's work lives. And so\r\nit would be in a factory, if employees once realized that by uniting\r\nthey could, as citizens, enforce health rights in the factory.\r\n\r\nThe hygiene of the workshop is not the same problem as the hygiene of\r\nthe home and schoolhouse, because there are by-products of factory work\r\nthat contaminate the air, overheat the room, and complicate the\r\nordinary problems of ventilation. Certain trades are recognized as\r\n\"dangerous trades.\" The problem of adequate government control of\r\nfactories is one for a sanitary engineer. It has to do with\r\ndisease-bearing raw material that comes to a factory, disease-producing\r\nprocesses of manufacture. There is need for revision of the\r\ndangerous-trade list. Many of the industries not so classed should be;\r\nmany of the so-called dangerous trades can be made comparatively\r\nharmless by devices for exhausting harmful by-products. Industrial\r\ndiseases should be made \"notifiable,\" so that they can be controlled by\r\nthe factory or health department. It is those trades that are dangerous\r\nbecause of remediable unsanitary and unhygienic conditions which demand\r\nthe employer's attention. Complaints should be made by individuals when\r\ncarelessness or danger becomes commonplace.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which many organizations have tried to better working\r\nconditions is similar to the manner in which Europeans are trying to\r\nhelp defective school children. Here, as there, is the difference\r\nbetween _doing things_ and _getting things done_. Here more than there\r\nis the tendency to exaggerate legislation and to neglect enforcement of\r\nlaw. Instead of harnessing the whole army of workingmen to the crusade\r\nand strengthening civic agencies such as factory, health, and tenement\r\ndepartments, houses are built and given to men, clubs are formed to\r\namuse factory girls, amateur theatricals are organized. All this is\r\ncalled \"welfare work.\" \"What is welfare work?\" reads the pamphlet of a\r\nlarge national association. \"It is especial consideration on the part\r\nof the employer for the welfare of his employees.\" In the words of this\r\npamphlet, the aim of this association \"is to organize the best brains\r\nof the nation in an educational movement toward the solution of some of\r\nthe great problems related to social and industrial progress.\" The\r\nmembership is drawn from \"practical men of affairs, whose acknowledged\r\nleadership in thought and business makes them typical representatives\r\nof business elements that voluntarily work together for the general\r\ngood.\" As defined by this organization, welfare work is something given\r\nto the employee by the employer for the welfare of both. It is not\r\nsomething the employee himself does to improve his own working\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n  We are told that employees should assume the management of welfare\r\n  work.\r\n\r\n  Should they install sanitary conveniences? Of course not.\r\n\r\n  Would they know the need of a wash room in a factory if they never\r\n  had had one? No.\r\n\r\n  Should they manage lunch rooms? A few employers have attempted\r\n  unsuccessfully to turn over the management of the lunch rooms to\r\n  the employees, the result being that one self-sacrificing\r\n  subofficial in each concern would find the burden entirely on his\r\n  shoulders before working hours, during working hours, and after\r\n  working hours. Employees cannot attend committee meetings during\r\n  working hours, and they are unwilling to do so afterwards, for\r\n  they generally have outside engagements. Furthermore, the\r\n  employees know nothing about the restaurant business. If they did,\r\n  they would probably be engaged in it instead of in their different\r\n  trades. All experiments along this line of which we have heard\r\n  have failed. The so-called \"democratic idea,\" purely a fad, never\r\n  has been successfully operated.\r\n\r\n  Many employers would introduce welfare work into their\r\n  establishments were it not for the time and trouble needed for its\r\n  organization. The employment of a welfare director removes this\r\n  obstacle. Successful prosecution of welfare work requires\r\n  concentration of responsibility. All of its branches must be under\r\n  the supervision of one person, or efforts in different directions\r\n  may conflict, or special and perhaps pressing needs may escape\r\n  attention. Pressure of daily business routine usually relegates\r\n  welfare work to the last consideration, but the average employer\r\n  is interested in his men and is willing to improve their condition\r\n  if only their needs are brought to his attention.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIRST LESSONS IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE]\r\n\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n | =Consumption=                                                      |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | Is chiefly caused by the Filthy Habit of                           |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | =SPITTING=                                                         |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | TAKE THIS CARD HOME                                                |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | And show it to your family, friends, and neighbors                 |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | Consumption is a disease of the lungs, which is taken from others, |\r\n | and is not simply caused by colds, although a cold may make it     |\r\n | easier to take the disease.                                        |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | The matter coughed up and sneezed out by consumptives is full of   |\r\n | living germs or \"tubercle bacilli\" too small to be seen.

Undoubtedly it\r\nhas succeeded, in many cases, in bringing to an employer's\r\nconsciousness the needs of his workmen, in accustoming employees to\r\nhigher sanitary standards, and in teaching them to demand health rights\r\nfrom their employers. In many cases, however, \"welfare work\" has\r\nmiseducated both employer and employee. The fact that \"the so-called\r\ndemocratic idea, purely a fad, has never been successfully operated,\"\r\nis due to the interpretation given to \"democratic idea.\" The two\r\nalternatives in the paragraph above quoted are lunch rooms, wash rooms,\r\nas gifts from employers to employees, or lunch rooms and wash rooms to\r\nbe furnished by employees at their own expense. The true democratic\r\nidea, however, is that factory conditions detrimental to health shall\r\nbe prohibited by factory legislation, and this legislation enforced by\r\nefficient factory inspectors, regardless of what may be given to\r\nemployees above the requirement of hygiene.\r\n\r\nUntil employees are more active as citizens and more sensitive to\r\nhygienic rights, it is desirable that welfare directors be employed in\r\nfactories to arbitrate between employer and employee, to raise the\r\nmoral standard of a factory settlement, to organize amusements.\r\n\r\nWelfare work at its best is a method of dividing business profits among\r\nall who participate in making these profits. Too often welfare\r\nsecretaries teach employees how to be happy in the director's way,\r\nrather than in their own way. This adventitious position increases\r\nsuspicion on both sides, disturbs the discipline of the foreman,\r\nweakens rather than strengthens the worker's efficiency, because it\r\ndepends upon other things than work well done and the relation of\r\nhealth to efficiency. In a small factory town the owner of a large\r\ncotton mill has recognized the financial benefit of physically strong\r\nworkers, and is trying the experiment of a welfare director. The man\r\nhimself works \"with his sleeves up.\" The social worker has an office in\r\nthe factory. A clubhouse is fitted up for the mill hands to make merry\r\nin. A room in the factory is reserved for a lunch room, with plants,\r\ntables, and chairs for the comfort of the women. Parties are given by\r\nthe employer to the employees, which he himself attends. He has thrown\r\nhimself into whatever schemes his director has suggested. The director\r\ncomplained that the reason the new lunch room was not more popular was\r\nbecause a piano was needed. A second-hand one would not do, for that\r\nwould cultivate bad taste in music. This showed the employer that soon\r\neverything would be expected from the \"big house on the hill.\" An event\r\nwhich happened at the time when the pressure was greatest on him for\r\nthe piano, convinced him that his employees could supply their real\r\nneeds without any trouble or delay. The assistant manager was about to\r\nleave, and in less than a week five hundred dollars was raised among\r\nthe workers for his farewell gift. Walking home that night late from\r\nhis office the owner was attracted by the sound of jollity, and saw a\r\nlittle room jammed full of mill people enjoying the improvised music of\r\na mouth organ played to the accompaniment of heels. He resolved\r\nhenceforth to train his employees to do his work well and to earn more\r\npay,--and to let them amuse themselves. From that time on he refused to\r\nbe looked upon as the _deus ex machina_ of the town. He decided that\r\nthe best way to give English lessons to foreigners was to improve the\r\nschool. His beneficence in supplying them with pure water at the mill\r\ndid not prevent a ravaging typhoid epidemic because the town water was\r\nnot watched. He saw that the best way to improve health was to\r\nstrengthen the health board and to make his co-workers realize that\r\nthey were citizens responsible for their own privileges and rights.\r\n\r\nEmergency hospitals and Y.M.C.A. buildings are sad substitutes for\r\nsafety devices and automatic couplers. Christmas shopping in November\r\nis less kind than prevention of overwork in December. Night school and\r\ngymnastic classes are a poor penance for child labor and for work\r\nunsuited to the body. The left hand cannot dole favors enough to offset\r\nthe evils of underpay, of unsanitary conditions, of inefficient\r\nenforcement of health laws tolerated by the right hand.\r\n\r\nJust because a man is taking wages for work done, is no reason why he\r\nshould forfeit his rights as a citizen, or allow his children, sisters,\r\nneighbors, to work in conditions which decrease their efficiency and\r\nearning power. What the employee can do for himself as a citizen,\r\nhaving equal health rights with employers, he has never been taught to\r\nsee. Factory legislation is state direction of industries so far as\r\nrelates to the safety, health, and moral condition of the people,--and\r\nwhich embraces to-day, more than in any other epoch, the opinion of the\r\nworkers themselves. No government, however strong, can hope\r\nsuccessfully to introduce social legislation largely affecting personal\r\ninterests until public opinion has been educated to the belief that the\r\nremedies proposed are really necessary. Until schools insist upon a\r\nbetter ventilation than the worst factories, how can we expect to find\r\nchildren of working age sensitive to impure air? Where work benches are\r\nmore comfortable than school desks, where drinking water is cleaner and\r\ntowels more sanitary, however unsanitary they may be, than those found\r\nin the schoolhouse, the worker does not realize that they menace his\r\nright to earn a living wage as much as does a temporary shut-down.\r\n\r\nEmployers are by no means solely to blame for unhealthy working\r\nconditions. A shortsighted employee is as anxious to work overtime for\r\ndouble pay as a shortsighted employer is to have him. Among those who\r\nare agitating for an eight-hour day are many who, from self-interest or\r\ninterest in the cause, work regularly from ten to sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nWould it help to punish employees for working in unhealthy places? The\r\nhighest service that can be rendered industrial hygiene is to educate\r\nthe industrial classes to recognize hygienic evils and to cooeperate\r\nwith other citizens in securing the enforcement of health rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS OF TUBERCULOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the historian Lecky was right in saying that the greatest triumphs of\r\nthe nineteenth century were its sanitary achievements, the Lecky of the\r\ntwenty-first century will probably honor our generation not for its\r\nelectricity, its trusts, and its scientific research, but for its\r\ncrusade against the white plague and for its recognition of health\r\nrights. Thanks to committees for the prevention of tuberculosis,--local,\r\nstate, national, international,--we are fast approaching the time when\r\nevery parent, teacher, employer, landlord, worker, will see in\r\ntuberculosis a personal enemy,--a menace to his fireside, his income,\r\nand his freedom. Just as this nation could not exist half slave, half\r\nfree, we of one mind now affirm that equal opportunity cannot exist\r\nwhere one death in ten is from a single preventable disease.[13]\r\n\r\nOf no obstacle to efficient living is it more true than of\r\ntuberculosis, that the remedy depends upon enforcing rather than upon\r\nmaking law, upon practice rather than upon precept, upon health habits\r\nrather than upon medical remedies, upon cooeperation of lay citizens\r\nrather than upon medical science or isolated individual effort. Without\r\nlearning another fact about tuberculosis, we can stamp it out if we\r\nwill but apply, and see that officers of health apply, lessons of\r\ncleanliness and natural living already known to us.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DR. TRUDEAU'S \"LITTLE RED COTTAGE\" AT\r\n    SARANAC--BIRTHPLACE OF OUT-OF-DOOR TREATMENT IN AMERICA]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking results yet obtained in combating\r\ntuberculosis are those of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\r\nTo visit its tuberculosis classes reminds one more of the sociable than\r\nthe clinic. In fact, one wonders whether the milk diet and the rest\r\ncure or the effervescing optimism and good cheer of the physicians and\r\nnurses should be credited with the marvelous cures. The first part of\r\nthe hour is given to writing on the blackboard the number of hours that\r\nthe class members spent out of doors the preceding week. So great was\r\nthe rivalry for first place that the nurse protested that a certain boy\r\nin the front row gave himself indigestion by trying to eat his meals in\r\nten or fifteen minutes. It was then suggested that twenty hours a day\r\nwould be enough for any one to stay out of doors, and that plenty of\r\ntime should be taken for meals with the family and for cold baths,\r\nkeeping clean, etc. Interesting facts gathered by personal interviews\r\nof two physicians with individual patients are explained to the whole\r\nclass. Next to the number of hours out of doors, the most interesting\r\nfact is the number of hours of exercise permitted. A man of forty, the\r\nhead of a family, beamed like a school child when told that, after\r\nnearly a year of absolute rest, he might during the next week exercise\r\nten minutes a day. A graduate drops in, the very picture of health,\r\nweighing two hundred pounds. An apparently hopeless case would brighten\r\nup and have confidence when told that this strong, handsome man has\r\ngained fifty pounds by rest, good cheer, fresh air, all on his own\r\nporch. One young man, just back from a California sanatorium where he\r\nprogressively lost strength in spite of change of climate, is now\r\nreturning to work and is back at normal weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OUTDOOR LIFE CHART.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN THE MOUNTAINS--SARANAC]\r\n\r\nEvery patient keeps a daily record, called for by the following\r\ninstructions:\r\n\r\n  Make notes of temperature and pulse at 8, 12, 4, and 8 o'clock,\r\n  daily; movements of bowels; hours in open air; all food taken;\r\n  total amount of milk; total amount of oil and butter; appetite;\r\n  digestion; spirits; cough (amount, chief time); expectoration\r\n  (amount in 24 hours, color, nature); exercise (if allowed), with\r\n  temperature and pulse 15 minutes after exercise; sweats; visitors.\r\n\r\nThe following simple instructions can be followed in any home, even\r\nwhere open windows must take the place of porches:\r\n\r\n  Rest out of doors is the medicine that cures consumption. Absolute\r\n  rest for mind and body brings speedy improvement. It stops the\r\n  cough and promotes the appetite. The lungs heal more quickly when\r\n  the body is at rest. Lie with the chest low, so the blood flow in\r\n  the lungs will aid to the uttermost the work of healing. The rest\r\n  habit is soon acquired. Each day of rest makes the next day of\r\n  rest easier, and shortens the time necessary to regain health. The\r\n  more time spent in bed out of doors the better. Do not dress if\r\n  the temperature is above 99 degrees, or if there is blood in the\r\n  sputum. It is life in the open air, not exercise, that brings\r\n  health and strength. Just a few minutes daily exercise during the\r\n  active stage of the disease may delay recovery weeks or months.\r\n  Rest favors digestion, exercise frequently disturbs digestion.\r\n  When possible have meals served in bed. Never think the rest\r\n  treatment can be taken in a rocking-chair. If tired of the cot,\r\n  shift to the reclining chair, but sit with head low and feet\r\n  elevated. Do not write letters. Dictate to a friend. Do not read\r\n  much and do not hold heavy books.

Most of the\r\nlocal secretaries are men whose inspiration came from contact with the\r\nnon-medical relief of the poor in city tenements. The secretary of the\r\nnational association is a university professor of anthropology, who has\r\nalso a medical degree. The child victim's plea--Little Jo's Smile--was\r\nnationalized by an association of laymen, aided by the advertising\r\nmanagers of forty magazines. The smaller cities of New York state are\r\nbeing aroused by a state voluntary association that for years has\r\nvisited almshouses, insane asylums, and hospitals. These facts I\r\nemphasize, for they illustrate the opportunity and the duty of the lay\r\neducator, whether parent, teacher, labor leader, or trustee of\r\nhospital, orphanage, or relief society.\r\n\r\nThree fundamental rules of action should be established as firmly as\r\nreligious principles:\r\n\r\n  1. The public health authorities should be told of every known and\r\n  every suspected case of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n  2. For each case proved by examination of sputum to be\r\n  tuberculous, the public-health officers should know that the germs\r\n  are destroyed before being allowed to contaminate air or food.\r\n\r\n  3. Sick and not yet sick should practice habits of health that\r\n  build up vitality to resist the tubercle bacilli and that abhor\r\n  uncleanliness as nature abhors a vacuum.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS WITH A NATIONAL\r\n    ORGANIZATION]\r\n\r\nAll laws, customs, and environmental conditions opposed to the\r\nenforcement of these three principles must be modified or abolished. If\r\nthe teachers of America will list for educational use in their own\r\ncommunities the local obstacles to these rules of action, they will see\r\nexactly where their local problem lies. The illustrations that are\r\ngiven in this book show in how many ways these rules of action are now\r\nbeing universalized. Three or four important steps deserve especial\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n  1. Compulsory notification of all tuberculous cases.\r\n\r\n  2. Compulsory removal to hospital of those not able at home to\r\n  destroy the bacilli, or compulsory supervision of home care.\r\n\r\n  3. Examination of all members of a family where one member is\r\n  discovered to be tuberculous.\r\n\r\n  4. Special provision for tuberculous teachers.\r\n\r\n  5. Protection of children about to enter industry but predisposed\r\n  to tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n  6. Prohibition of dry cleaning of schools, offices, and streets.\r\n\r\n  7. Tax provision for educational and preventive work.\r\n\r\nCompulsory notification was introduced first in New York City by\r\nHermann M. Biggs, M.D., chief medical officer: 1893, partially\r\nvoluntary, partially compulsory; 1897, compulsory for all. Physicians\r\nwho now hail Dr. Biggs as a statesman called him persecutor, autocrat,\r\nand violator of personal freedom fifteen years ago. Foreign sanitarians\r\nvied with American colleagues in upbraiding him for his exaggeration of\r\nthe transmissibility of consumption and for his injustice to its\r\nvictims. As late as 1899 one British expert particularly resented the\r\nrejection of tuberculous immigrants at Ellis Island, and said to me,\r\n\"Perhaps if you should open a man's mouth and pour in tubercle bacilli\r\nhe might get phthisis, but compulsory notification is preposterous.\" In\r\n1906 the International Congress on Tuberculosis met in Paris and\r\ncongratulated New York upon its leadership in securing at health\r\nheadquarters a list of the known disease centers within its borders; in\r\n1906 more than twenty thousand individual cases were reported, ten\r\nthousand of these being reported more than once. To know the nature and\r\nlocation of twenty thousand germ factories is a long step toward\r\njudging their strength and their probable product. To compulsory\r\nnotification in New York City is largely due the educational movements\r\nof the last decade against the white plague, more particularly the\r\ngrowing ability among physicians to recognize and to treat conditions\r\npredisposing to the disease. As in New York City, the public should\r\nprovide free of cost bacteriological analysis of sputum to learn\r\npositively whether tuberculosis is present. Simpler still is the\r\ntuberculin test of the eyes, with which experiments are now being made\r\non a large scale in New York City, and which bids fair to become cheap\r\nenough to be generally used wherever physical examinations are made.\r\nThis test is known as Calmette's Eye Test. Inside the eyelid is placed\r\na drop of a solution--95 per cent alcohol and tuberculin. If\r\nconjunctivitis develops in twenty-four hours, the patient is proved to\r\nhave tuberculosis. Some physicians still fear to use this test. Others\r\nquestion its proof. The \"skin test\" is also being thoroughly tried in\r\nseveral American cities and, if finally found trustworthy, will\r\ngreatly simplify examination for tuberculosis. Dr. John W. Brannan,\r\npresident of Bellevue and Allied Hospitals, New York City, is to report\r\non skin and eye tuberculin tests for children at the International\r\nCongress on Tuberculosis, mentioned later.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS BY ORGANIZED COOePERATIVE\r\n    DISPENSARY WORK]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING BONE TUBERCULOSIS AT SEA BREEZE, WHERE\r\n    EYE AND SKIN TUBERCULIN TESTS ARE BEING MADE]\r\n\r\nCompulsory removal of careless consumptives is yet rare. One obstacle\r\nis the lack of hospitals. In New York ten thousand die annually from\r\ntuberculosis and fifty thousand are known to have it, yet there are\r\nonly about two thousand beds available. So long as the patients anxious\r\nfor hospital care exceed the number of beds, it does not seem fair to\r\ngive a bed to some one who does not want it. On the other hand, it\r\nshould not be forgotten that patients are taken forcibly to smallpox\r\nand scarlet-fever hospitals, not for their own good, but for the\r\nprotection of others. The last person who should be permitted to stay\r\nat home is the tuberculous person who is unable, unwilling, or too\r\nignorant to take the necessary precautions for others' protection. A\r\nrigid educational test should be applied as a condition of remaining at\r\nhome without supervision.\r\n\r\nThe objections to compulsory removal are two: (1) it is desired to make\r\nsanatorium care so attractive that patients will go at the earliest\r\nstage of the disease; (2) an unwilling patient can defeat the\r\nsanitarian's effort to help him and others. The alternative for\r\ncompulsory removal is gratuitous, and, if need be, compulsory,\r\nsupervision of home care, such as is now given in New York City. In\r\nBrighton, England, Dr. Newsholme treats his municipal sanatorium as a\r\nvacation school, giving each patient one month only. Thus one bed helps\r\ntwelve patients each year. Almost any worker can spare one month and in\r\nthat time can be made into a missionary of healthy living.\r\n\r\nFamily examining parties were begun in New York by Dr. Linsly R.\r\nWilliams, for the relief agency that started the seaside treatment of\r\nbone tuberculosis. Many of the crippled children at Sea Breeze were\r\nfound to have consumptive fathers or mothers. In one instance the\r\nfather had died before Charlie had \"hip trouble.\" Long after we had\r\nknown Charlie his mother began to fail. She too had consumption. Family\r\nparties were planned for 290 families. Weights were taken and careful\r\nexamination made, the physician explaining that predisposition means\r\ndefective lung capacity or deficient vitality. Of 379 members,\r\nsupposedly free from tuberculosis, sixteen were found to have\r\nwell-marked cases. (Of twenty Boston children whose parents were in a\r\ntuberculosis class, four had tuberculosis.) In one instance the father\r\nwas astonished to learn not only that he was tuberculous, but that he\r\nhad probably given the disease to the mother, for whom he was tenderly\r\nconcerned. Of special benefit were the talks about teeth and\r\nnourishment, and about fresh air and water as germ killers. One\r\nexamination of this kind will organize a family crusade against\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN SMALL CITIES\r\n    New York State Charities Aid Association]\r\n\r\nTuberculous teachers ought to be excluded from schoolrooms not merely\r\nbecause they may spread tuberculosis, but because they cannot do\r\njustice to school work without sacrifices that society ought not to\r\naccept. A tuberculous teacher ought to be generous enough to permit\r\npublic hospitals to restore her strength or enterprising enough to\r\njoin tuberculosis classes. It is selfish to demand independence at the\r\nprice which is paid by schools that employ tuberculous teachers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING BONE TUBERCULOSIS WITH SALT WATER AND\r\n    SALT AIR]\r\n\r\nPredisposition to tuberculosis should be understood by every child\r\nbefore he is accepted as an industrial soldier. Many trades now\r\ndangerous would be made safe if workers knew the risk they run, and if\r\nsociety forbade such trades needlessly to exhaust their employees. A\r\nperfectly sound man is predisposed to tuberculosis if he elects to work\r\nin stale, dust-laden air. Ill-ventilated rooms, cramped positions, lack\r\nof exercise in the open air, prepare lungs to give a cordial reception\r\nto tubercle bacilli. Rooms as well as persons become infected.\r\nFortunately, opportunities to work are so varied in most localities\r\nthat workers predisposed to tuberculosis may be sure of a livelihood in\r\nan occupation suited to their vitality. Destruction of germs in the\r\nair, in carpets, on walls, on streets, is quite as important as\r\ndestruction of germs in lungs. Why should not tenants and workers\r\nrequire health certificates stating that neither house nor working\r\nplace is infected with tubercle bacilli? Some cities now compel the\r\ndisinfection of premises occupied by tuberculous persons _after_ their\r\nremoval. Landlords, employers, tenants, and employees can easily be\r\ntaught to see the advantage of disinfecting premises occupied by\r\ntuberculous cases _before_ detection.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING FEATHER DUSTERS IS ONE OBJECT OF SEA-AIR\r\n    HOSPITALS FOR BONE TUBERCULOSIS]\r\n\r\nDry cleaning, feather dusters, dust-laden air, will disappear from\r\nschoolrooms within twenty-four hours after school-teachers declare that\r\nthey shall disappear. We have no right to expect street cleaners,\r\ntenement and shop janitors, or overworked mothers to be more careful\r\nthan school-teachers. Last year I said to a janitress, \"Don't you\r\nrealize that you may get consumption if you use that feather duster?\"\r\nHer reply caused us to realize our carelessness: \"I don't want any more\r\nthan I've got now.\" Shall we some day have compulsory examination and\r\ninstruction of all cleaners, starting with school cleaners?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING TUBERCULOSIS IN OPEN TENTS]\r\n\r\nTaxing is swift to follow teaching in matters of health. Teachers can\r\neasily compute what their community loses from tuberculosis. The totals\r\nwill for some time prove a convincing argument for cleanliness of air,\r\nof body, and of building wherever the community is responsible for air,\r\nbuilding, and body. The annual cost of tuberculosis to New York City is\r\nestimated at $23,000,000 and to the United States at $330,000,000. The\r\ncost of exterminating it will be but a drop in the bucket if\r\nschool-teachers do their part this next generation with the twenty\r\nmillion children whose day environment they control for three fourths\r\nof the year, and whose habits they can determine.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting in America of the International Congress on\r\nTuberculosis was held at Washington, D.C., September 21 to October 12,\r\n1908. For many years the proceedings of this congress will undoubtedly\r\nbe the chief reference book on the conquest of tuberculosis.[14]\r\n\r\nHow many aspects there are to this problem, and how many kinds of\r\npeople may be enlisted, may be seen from the seven section names: I.\r\nPathology and Bacteriology; II.

The time is\r\nnot far distant when those states and municipalities which have not\r\nadopted a comprehensive plan for dealing with tuberculosis will be\r\nregarded as almost criminally negligent in their administration of\r\nsanitary affairs and inexcusably blind to their own best economic\r\ninterests._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] The best literature on tuberculosis is in current magazines and\r\nreports of anti-tuberculosis crusaders. For a scientific, comprehensive\r\ntreatment, libraries and students should have _The Prevention of\r\nTuberculosis_ (1908) by Arthur Newsholme, M.D. A popular book is _The\r\nCrusade against Tuberculosis_, by Lawrence F. Flick, of the Henry Phipps\r\nInstitute for the Study, Treatment, and Prevention of Tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n[14] Those desiring copies this year or hereafter will do well to write\r\nto The National Association for the Study and Prevention of\r\nTuberculosis, 105 East 22d St., New York City. The congress is under the\r\ncontrol of the National Association and is managed by a special\r\ncommittee appointed by it. Even after a national board of health is\r\nestablished, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of\r\nTuberculosis will continue to be a center for private interest in public\r\nprotection against tuberculosis. One of its chief functions is the\r\npreparation and distribution of literature to those who desire it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT FOR CLEAN MILK\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With the approval of the President and with the cooeperation of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture,[15] the [national quarantine] service has\r\nundertaken to prepare a complete report upon the milk industry from\r\nfarm to the consumer in its relation to the public health.\" This\r\npromise of the United States Treasury insures national attention to the\r\nevils of unclean milk and to the sanitary standards of farmer and\r\nconsumer. Nothing less than a national campaign can make the vivid\r\nimpression necessary to wean dairymen of uncleanly habits and mothers\r\nof the ignorant superstition that babies die in summer just because\r\nthey are babies. When two national bureaus study, learn, and report,\r\nnewspapers will print their stories on the first page, magazines will\r\nherald the conclusions, physicians will open their minds to new truths,\r\nstate health secretaries will carry on the propaganda, demagogues and\r\nquacks will become less certain of their short-cut remedies, and\r\n_everybody will be made to think_.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of this newly awakened national interest in clean milk\r\nfollows the seven stages and illustrates the seven health motives\r\npresented in Chapter II. I give the story of Robert M. Hartley because\r\nhe began and prosecuted his pure-milk crusade in a way that can be\r\nduplicated in any country town or small city.\r\n\r\nRobert M. Hartley was a strong-bodied, strong-minded, country-bred man,\r\nwho started church work in New York City almost as soon as he arrived.\r\nHe distributed religious tracts among the alleys and hovels that\r\ncharacterized lower New York in 1825. Meeting drunken men and women one\r\nafter another, he first wondered whether they were helped by tracts,\r\nand then decided that the mind befogged with alcohol was unfit to\r\nreceive the gospel message. Then for fifteen years he threw himself\r\ninto a total-abstinence crusade, distributing thousands of pamphlets,\r\ncalling in one year at over four thousand homes to teach the industrial\r\nand moral reasons for total abstinence. Finally, he began to wonder\r\nwhether back of alcoholism there was not still a dark closet that must\r\nbe explored before men could receive the message of religion and\r\nself-control. So in 1843 he organized the New York Association for\r\nImproving the Condition of the Poor, which ever since has remembered\r\nhow Hartley found alcoholism back of irreligion, and how back of\r\nalcoholism and poverty and ignorant indifference he found indecent\r\nhousing, unsanitary streets, unwholesome working conditions, and impure\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIGHTING INFANT MORTALITY BY A SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS\r\n    IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY,--JUNIOR SEA BREEZE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PROVIDING AGAINST GERM GROWTH AND ADAPTING MILK\r\n    TO THE INDIVIDUAL BABY'S NEED,--ROCHESTER'S MODEL DAIRY]\r\n\r\nHartley's instinct started the first great pure-milk agitation in this\r\ncountry. While visiting a distillery for the purpose of trying to\r\npersuade the owner to invest his money in another business, he noticed\r\nthat \"slops smoking hot from the stills\" were being carried to cow\r\nstables. He followed and was nauseated by the sights and odors. Several\r\nhundred uncleaned cows in low, suffocating, filthy stables were being\r\nfed on \"this disgusting, unnatural food.\" Similar disgust has in many\r\nother American cities caused the first effort to better dairy\r\nconditions. Hartley could never again enjoy milk from distillery cows.\r\nFurthermore, his story of 1841 made it impossible for any readers of\r\nnewspapers in New York to enjoy milk until assured that it was not\r\nproduced by distillery slops. The instinctive loathing and the\r\ndiscomfort of buyers awakened the commerce motives of milk dealers, who\r\ncovered their wagons with signs declaring that they \"no longer\" or\r\n\"never\" fed cows on distillery refuse. But Hartley could not stop when\r\nthe anti-nuisance stage was reached. He did not let up on his fight\r\nagainst impure or adulterated milk until the state legislature declared\r\nin 1864 that _every baby, city born or country born, no matter how\r\nhumble its home, has the right to pure milk_.\r\n\r\n +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |  =Clean Milk for New York City=                                   |\r\n |                                                                   |\r\n |  =CONFERENCE=                                                     |\r\n |                                                                   |\r\n |  =ROOM 44, N.Y.

   |\r\n +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Hartley and his contemporaries had never heard of disease\r\ngerms that are carried by unclean milk into the human stomach. Science\r\nhad not yet proved that many forms of barnyard filth could do quite as\r\nmuch harm as distillery refuse. Commerce had not invented milk bottles\r\nof glass or paper. The law of 1864 failed in two particulars: (1) it\r\ndid not demand cleanliness from cow to consumer; (2) it did not provide\r\nmeans for its own enforcement, for learning whether everything and\r\neverybody that had to do with milk was clean. Not knowing of germs and\r\ntheir love for a warm climate and warm food, they naturally did not\r\nprohibit a temperature above fifty degrees from the time of milking to\r\nthe time of sale. How much has been left for our generation to do to\r\nsecure pure milk is illustrated by the opening sentence of this\r\nchapter, and more specifically by the programme of a milk conference\r\nheld in New York in November, 1906, the board of health joining in the\r\ncall. The four-page folder is reproduced in facsimile (excepting the\r\nnames on the fourth page), because it states the universal problem, and\r\nalso because it suggests an effective way to stimulate relevant\r\ndiscussion and to discourage the long speeches that spoil many\r\nconferences.\r\n\r\nThis conference led to the formation of a milk committee under the\r\nauspices of the association founded by Hartley. Business men,\r\nchildren's specialists, journalists, clergymen, consented to serve\r\nbecause they realized the need for a continuing public interest and a\r\npersisting watchfulness. Such committees are needed in other cities and\r\nin states, either as independent committees or as subcommittees of\r\ngeneral organizations, such as women's clubs, sanitary leagues, county\r\nand state medical societies. Teachers' associations might well be\r\nadded, especially for rural and suburban districts where they are more\r\napt than any other organized body to see the evils that result from\r\nunclean milk. The New York Milk Committee set a good example in paying\r\na secretary to give his entire time to its educational programme,--a\r\npaid secretary can keep more volunteers and consultants busy than could\r\na dozen volunteers giving \"what time they can spare.\" Thanks chiefly to\r\nthe conference and the Milk Committee's work, several important results\r\nhave been effected. The general public has realized as never before\r\nthat two indispensable adjectives belong to safe milk,--_clean_ and\r\n_cool_. Additional inspectors have been sent to country dairies;\r\nrefrigeration, cans, and milk have been inspected upon arrival at\r\nnight; score cards have been introduced, thanks to the convincing\r\nexplanations of their effectiveness by the representatives of the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry of the national Department of Agriculture;\r\n8640 milch cows were inspected by veterinary practitioners (1905-1907),\r\nto learn the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (of these thirty-six per\r\ncent reacted to the tuberculin test); state societies and state\r\ndepartments have been aroused to demand an efficient live-stock\r\nsanitary board; magistrates have fined and imprisoned offenders against\r\nthe milk laws, where formerly they \"warned\"; popular illustrated milk\r\nlectures were added to the public school courses; illustrated cards\r\nwere distributed by the thousand, telling how to keep the baby well;\r\nfinally, private educational and relief societies, dispensaries,\r\nsettlements, have been increasingly active in teaching mothers at home\r\nhow to prepare baby's milk. In 1908 a Conference on Summer Care of\r\nBabies was organized representing the departments of health and\r\neducation, and fifty private agencies for the care of sick babies and\r\nthe instruction of mothers. The superintendent of schools instructed\r\nteachers to begin the campaign by talks to children and by giving out\r\nillustrated cards. Similar instructions were sent to parochial schools\r\nby the archbishop.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NIGHT INSPECTION OF COUNTRY MILK UPON ARRIVAL IN\r\n    NEW YORK CITY]\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere, there are two schools of pure-milk crusaders: (1) those\r\nwho want cities to _do things_, to pasteurize all milk, start milk\r\nfarms, milk shops, or pure-milk dispensaries; and (2) those who want\r\ncities and states to _get things done_. So far the New York Milk\r\nCommittee has led the second school and has opposed efforts to\r\nmunicipalize the milk business. The leader of the other school is the\r\nnoted philanthropist, Nathan Strauss, who has established\r\npasteurization plants in several American and European cities. The\r\ndiscussion of the two schools, similar in aim but different in method,\r\nis made more difficult, because to question philanthropy's method\r\nalways seems to philanthropy itself and to most bystanders an\r\nungracious, ungrateful act. As the issue, however, is clean milk, not\r\npersonal motive, it is important that educators and parents in all\r\ncommunities benefit from the effective propaganda of both schools,\r\nusing what is agreed upon as the basis for local pure-milk crusades,\r\nreserving that which is controversial for final settlement by research\r\nover large fields that involve hundreds of thousands of tests.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A NEW YORK MILK COMMITTEE'S INFANT DEPOT AND\r\n    SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS]\r\n\r\nPasteurization, municipal dairies, municipal milk shops, municipal\r\ninfant-milk depots, are the four chief remedies of the _doing things_\r\nschool. European experience is cited in support of each. We are told\r\nthat cow's milk, intended by nature for an infant cow with four\r\nstomachs, is not suited, even when absolutely pure, to the human\r\ninfant's single stomach. Cow's milk should be modified, weakened,\r\ndiluted, to fit the digestive powers of the individual infant; hence\r\nthe municipal depot or milk dispensary that provides exactly the right\r\nmilk for each baby, prescribed by municipal physicians and nurses who\r\nknow. That the well-to-do and the just-past-infancy may have milk as\r\nsafe as babies receive at the depot, municipalization of farm and milk\r\nshop is advocated. Some want the city to run only enough farms and milk\r\nshops to set a standard for private farmers, as has been done in\r\nRochester. This is city ownership and operation for educational\r\npurposes only. Finally, because raw milk even from clean dairies may\r\ncontain germs of typhoid, scarlet fever, or tuberculosis,\r\npasteurization is demanded to kill every germ. There are advocates of\r\npasteurization that deprecate the practice and deny that raw milk is\r\nnecessarily dangerous; they favor it for the time being until farms and\r\nshops have acquired habits of cleanliness. Likewise many would prefer\r\nprivate pasteurization or laws compelling pasteurization of all milk\r\noffered for sale; but they despair of obtaining safe milk unless city\r\nofficials are held responsible for safety. Why wait to discuss\r\npolitical theories about the proper sphere for government, when, by\r\nacting, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved annually? These\r\nmethods of _doing things_ will not add to the price of milk; it is, in\r\nfact, probable that the reduction in the cost of caring for the sick\r\nand for inspecting farms and shops will offset the net cost of depots,\r\nfarms, and dairies.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ONE OF ROCHESTER'S SCHOOLS IN CLEANLINESS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROCHESTER'S MODEL DAIRY FARM]\r\n\r\nAs to pasteurization, its cost is negligible, while the cost of\r\ncleanliness is two, four, or ten cents a quart. Whether ideally clean\r\nmilk is safe or not, raw milk that is not clean is unfit for human\r\nconsumption. All cities should compel evidence of pasteurization as a\r\ncondition of sale. Large cities should have their own pasteurizing\r\nplants, just as many cities now have their own vaccine farms and\r\nantitoxin laboratories. Parents in small towns and in the country\r\nshould be taught to pasteurize all milk.\r\n\r\nThe _getting things done_ school admits the need for modified milk of\r\nstrength suited to the infant's stomach; affirms the danger of milk\r\nthat contains harmful germs; demands educational work by city, state,\r\nand nation; confesses that talk about cleanliness will not make milk\r\nsafe. On the other hand, it denies that raw milk is necessarily\r\ndangerous; that properly modified, clean, raw milk is any safer when\r\npasteurized; that talking about germ-proof milk insures germ\r\nextinction. It maintains that pasteurization kills benign germs\r\nessential to the life of milk, and that after benign germs are killed,\r\npasteurized milk, if exposed to infection, is more dangerous than raw\r\nmilk, for the rapid growth of harmful germs is no longer contested by\r\nbenign germs fighting for supremacy. While it is admitted that raw milk\r\nproduced under ideal conditions may become infected by some person\r\nignorant of his condition, and before detection may cause typhoid,\r\nscarlet fever, or consumption, it has not been proved that such\r\ninstances are frequent or that the aggregate of harm done equals that\r\nwhich pasteurized milk may do. Pasteurization does not remove chemical\r\nimpurities; boiling dirt does not render it harmless. The remedy for\r\ngerm-infected milk is to keep germs out of milk. The remedy for unclean\r\nmilk is cleanliness of cow, cow barn, cowyard, milker, milk can,\r\ncreamery, milk shop, bottle, nipple. If the sale of unclean milk is\r\nprevented, farmers will, as a matter of course, supply clean milk. By\r\nteaching farmers and milk retailers the economic advantages of\r\ncleanliness they will cultivate habits that guarantee a clean milk\r\nsupply. By punishing railroads and milk companies that transport milk\r\nat a temperature which encourages germ growth, and by dumping in the\r\ngutter milk that is offered for sale above 50 degrees, the\r\nrefrigerating of milk will be made the rule. Purging magistrates'\r\ncourts of their leniency toward dealers in impure, dangerous milk is\r\nbetter than purging milk of germs. Boiling milk receptacles will save\r\nmore babies than boiling milk. Teaching mothers about the care of\r\nbabies will bring better results than giving them a false sense of\r\nsafety, because only one of many dangers has been removed by\r\npasteurization. Educating consumers to demand clean milk and to\r\nsupport aggressive work by health departments leaves fewer evils\r\nunchecked than covering up uncleanliness by pasteurization.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEW YORK MILK COMMITTEE'S GRAPHIC METHOD OF\r\n    SHOWING BABIES' PROGRESS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PRODUCING WINTER CONDITIONS IN MIDSUMMER BY\r\n    PROPER REFRIGERATION FOR MILK IN FREIGHT CARS]\r\n\r\nWhen doctors disagree what are we laymen to do? We can take an\r\nintelligent interest in the inquiries that are now being made by city,\r\nstate, and national governments. Because everybody believes that clean\r\nmilk is safer than unclean milk, that milk at 50 degrees will not breed\r\nharmful germs, we can demand milk inspection that will tell our health\r\nofficers and ourselves which dealers sell only clean milk at 50 degrees\r\nand never more than 60 degrees, that never shows over 100,000 colonies\r\nto the cubic centimeter. We can get our health departments to publish\r\nthe results of their scoring of dairies and milk shops in the papers,\r\nas has been done in Montclair. We can tell our health officers that the\r\nbest results in fighting infant mortality are at Rochester, which city,\r\nwinter and summer, by inspection, correspondence, and punishment,\r\neducates farmers and dealers in cleanliness, not only censuring when\r\ndirty or careless, but explaining how to make more money by being\r\nclean. Finally, mothers can be taught at home how to cleanse the\r\nbottles, the nipples, all milk receptacles, and all things in rooms\r\nwhere milk is kept. Absolutely clean milk of proper temperature _at the\r\nshop_ may not safely be given to a baby in a dirty bottle. Infant milk\r\ndepots, pasteurization, the best medical and hospital care, breast\r\nfeeding itself, cannot prevent high baby mortality if mothers are not\r\nclean. The most effective volunteer effort for pure milk is that which\r\nfirst makes the health machinery do its part and then teaches, teaches,\r\nteaches mothers and all who have to do with babies.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEITHER PASTEURIZATION NOR INSPECTION CAN MAKE IT\r\n    SAFE TO SELL \"DIP MILK\" UNDER SUCH UNCLEAN CONDITIONS]\r\n\r\n\"Clean air, clean babies, clean milk,\" has been the slogan of Junior\r\nSea Breeze,--a school for mothers right in the heart of New York's\r\nupper East Side. In the summer of 1907 twenty nurses went from house to\r\nhouse telling 102,000 mothers how to keep the baby well. This was the\r\nonly district that had fewer baby deaths than for 1906. Had other parts\r\nof the city shown the same gain, there would have been a saving of 1100\r\nbabies. The following winter a similar work was conducted by nurses\r\nfrom the recently founded Caroline Rest, which has an educational fund\r\nfor instruction of mothers in the care of babies, especially babies not\r\nyet born and just born. Heretofore the baby has been expected to cry\r\nand to have summer complaint before anybody worried about the treatment\r\nit received. If the baby lived through its second summer, it was\r\nconsidered great good fortune. Junior Sea Breeze and Caroline Rest\r\nstart their educational work before the baby is sick, in fact, before\r\nit is born. Their results have been so notable that several well-to-do\r\nmothers declare that they wish they too might have a school.\r\nDispensaries and diet kitchens and more particularly maternity wards of\r\nhospitals, family physicians, nurses, and midwives, should be required\r\nto know how to teach mothers to feed babies regularly, the right\r\nquantities, under conditions that insure cleanliness whether the breast\r\nor the bottle is used. Perhaps some day no girl will be given a\r\ngraduating certificate, or a license for work, teaching, or marriage,\r\nuntil she has demonstrated her ability to give some mother's baby\r\n\"clean air, clean body, clean milk.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Libraries should obtain all reports on milk, Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE \"HUMANIZED\" MEDICINE: PHYSICIAN AND TEACHER\r\n\r\n\r\nNo profession, excepting possibly the ministry, is regarded with\r\ngreater deference than the medical profession. Our ancestors listened\r\nwith awe and obedience to the warnings and behests of the medicine man,\r\nbloodletter, bonesetter, family doctor. In modern times doctors have\r\ndisagreed with each other often enough to warrant laymen in questioning\r\nthe infallibility of any individual healer or any sect, whether\r\nhomeopath, allopath, eclectic, osteopath, or scientist. Yet to this day\r\nmost of us surround the medical profession or the healing art with an\r\natmosphere of necromancy. Even after we have given up faith in drugs or\r\nafter belief is denied in the reality of disease and pain, we revere\r\nthe calling that concerns itself, whether gratuitously or for pay, with\r\nconquering bodily ills.\r\n\r\nSelf-laudation continues this hold of the medical profession upon the\r\nlay imagination. One physician may challenge another's faults, ridicule\r\nhis remedies, call his antitoxin dangerous poison, but their common\r\nprofession he proudly styles \"the most exalted form of altruism.\" Young\r\nmen and women beginning the study or the practice of medicine are\r\nexhorted to continue its traditions of self-denial, and in their very\r\nsouls to place human welfare before personal or pecuniary advancement.\r\nNewspapers repeat exhortation and laudation. We laymen pass on the\r\nstory that we know is not universally true,--physicians know,\r\nphysicians apply what they know without consciousness of error,\r\nphysicians must be implicitly trusted.\r\n\r\nFor a physician to give poison when he means to give food is worse, not\r\nbetter, than for a layman to make the same mistake. Neither the moral\r\ncode nor the law of self-preservation enjoins a tuberculous mother to\r\ntake alcohol or to sleep in an unventilated room, even if an uninformed\r\nphysician prescribes it. Instruction in physiology and hygiene would be\r\nfutile if those who are educated as to the elementary facts of hygiene\r\nand physiology must blindly follow blind physicians. A family doctor\r\nwho gives cod-liver oil for anaemia due to adenoids may do a child as\r\nmuch harm as a nurse who drugs the baby to make it sleep. The physician\r\nwho refuses to tell the board of health when smallpox or typhoid fever\r\nfirst breaks out takes human life just as truly as if he tore up the\r\ntracks in front of an express train. This is another way of saying that\r\nparents and teachers must fit themselves to know whether the family\r\nphysician and their community's physicians are efficient practitioners\r\nand teachers. Every one can learn enough about the preventable causes\r\nof sickness and depleted vitality to insist upon the ounce of education\r\nand prevention that is better than a pound of cure.\r\n\r\nFor its sins of omission, as for its sins of commission, the medical\r\nprofession shares responsibility with laymen. For years leading\r\neducators, business men, hospital directors, public officials, have\r\nknown that communicable diseases could be stamped out. The methods have\r\nbeen demonstrated. There is absolutely no excuse to-day for epidemics\r\nof typhoid in Trenton, Pittsburg, or Scranton, for epidemics of scarlet\r\nfever in the small towns of Minnesota, for uninterrupted epidemics of\r\ntuberculosis everywhere. Had either laymen, physicians, or\r\nschool-teachers made proper use of the knowledge that has been in\r\ntext-books for a generation, this country would be saving thousands of\r\nlives and millions of dollars every year. Our _doing_ and _getting\r\ndone_ have lagged behind our _knowing_.\r\n\r\nThe failure of physicians to \"socialize\" or \"humanize\" their knowledge\r\nis due to two causes: (1) no one has been applying _result tests_ to\r\nthe profession as a whole and to the state in its capacity as doctor,\r\ntesting carefully the sickness rate, the death rate, and the expense\r\nrate of preventable diseases; (2) physicians themselves have not needed\r\nto know, either at college or in practice, the tax levied upon their\r\ncommunities by preventable sickness. Public schools can do much to\r\nsecure result tests for individual physicians, for the profession as a\r\nwhole, and for boards of health. Schooling in preventive medicine, or,\r\nbetter named, schooling in preventive hygiene, will fit physicians to\r\ndo their part in eradicating preventable disease.\r\n\r\nPreventive hygiene is not an essential part of the training of American\r\nphysicians or nurses to-day. Not only are there no colleges of\r\npreventive hygiene, but medical schools have not provided individual\r\ncourses. It is possible for a man to graduate with honors from our\r\nleading medical colleges without knowing what \"vital statistics\" means.\r\nEven boards of health, their duties and their educational\r\nopportunities, are not understood by graduates; it is an accident if\r\nthe \"social and economic aspects of medical practice,\" \"statistical\r\nfallacies,\" \"hospital administration,\" \"infant mortality,\" are familiar\r\nterms. It is for this reason, rather than because physicians are\r\nselfish, that indispensable and beneficent legislation is so generally\r\nopposed by them when the prerogatives of their profession seem in\r\ndanger. Practically every important sanitary advance of the past\r\ncentury has been fought at the outset by those whose life work should\r\nhave made them see the need. Physicians bitterly attacked compulsory\r\nvaccination, medical inspection of schools, compulsory notification of\r\ncommunicable diseases. What is perhaps more significant of the\r\nphysician's indifference to preventive hygiene is the fact that most of\r\nthe sanitary movements that have revolutionized hygienic conditions in\r\nAmerica owe their inception and their success to laymen, for example,\r\ntenement-house reform, anti-child labor and anti-tuberculosis crusades,\r\nwelfare work in factories, campaigns for safety appliances, movement\r\nfor a national board of health, prison, almshouse, and insane-asylum\r\nreform, schools for mothers, and milk committees. The first hospital\r\nfor infectious diseases, the first board of health, the first\r\nout-of-door sea-air treatment of bone tuberculosis in the United\r\nStates, were the result of lay initiative.\r\n\r\nDr. Hermann M. Biggs says that in America the greatest need of the\r\nmedical profession and of health administration is training that will\r\nenable physicians and lay inspectors to use their knowledge of\r\npreventive hygiene for the removal of living and working conditions\r\nthat cause preventable sickness. A physician without knowledge of\r\npreventive hygiene is simply doing a \"general repair\" business.\r\n\r\nFor a few months in 1907 New York City had a highly efficient\r\ncommissioner of street cleaning, who, in spite of the unanimous\r\nprotests and appeals of the press, refused to give up the practice of\r\nmedicine. Hitherto the board of health of that city has been unable to\r\nobtain the full time of its physicians because professional standards\r\ngive greater credit to the retail application of remedies than to the\r\nwholesale application of preventives.\r\n\r\nStatesmanship as well as professional ability is expected of physicians\r\nin the leading European cities, more particularly of those connected\r\nwith health departments. There it is not felt that a medical degree is\r\nof itself a qualification for sanitary or health work. After the\r\nprofessional course, physicians must take courses in preventive hygiene\r\nand in health administration. Medical courses include such subjects as\r\nvital statistics, duties of medical officers of health, sanitary\r\nlegislation, state medicine.\r\n\r\nThe needless cost for one year of \"catching\" diseases in New York City\r\nwould endow in perpetuity all the schools and lectureships and journals\r\nnecessary to teach preventive hygiene in every section of this great\r\ncountry. That city alone sacrifices twenty-eight thousand lives\r\nannually to diseases that are officially called preventable. The yearly\r\nburial cost of these victims of professional and community neglect is\r\nmore than a million dollars. When to the doctor bills, wages lost,\r\nburial cost of those who die are added the total doctor bills, wages\r\nlost, and other expenses of the sick who do not die, we find that one\r\ncity loses in dollars and cents more every year from communicable\r\ndiseases than is spent by the whole United States for hospitals and\r\nboards of health.\r\n\r\nMany diseases and much sickness are preventable that are not\r\ncommunicable. Indigestion due to bad teeth is not itself communicable,\r\nbut it can be prevented. One's vitality may be sapped by irregular\r\neating or too little sleep; others will not catch the trouble, although\r\ntoo often they imitate the harmful habits. Adenoids and defective\r\nvision are preventable, but not contagious. Spinal curvature and flat\r\nfoot are unnecessary, but others cannot catch them. Preventive hygiene,\r\nhowever, should teach the physician's duty to educate his patient and\r\nhis community regarding all controllable conditions that injure or\r\npromote the health.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of special attention to preventive medicine new truth is\r\nforced to fight its way, sometimes for generations, before it is\r\naccepted by the medical profession. So strong are the traditions of\r\nthat profession and so difficult is it for the unconventional or\r\nheterodox individual to retain the confidence of conservative patients,\r\nthat the forces of honorable medical practice tend to discourage\r\nresearch and invention. The man who discovers a surgical appliance is\r\nforced by the ethics of his profession either to commercialize it and\r\nlose his professional standing, or to abide the convenience of his\r\ncolleagues and their learned organizations in testing it. Rather than\r\nbe branded a quack, charlatan, or crank, the physician keeps silent as\r\nto convictions which do not conform to the text-books. Many a\r\nlife-saving, health-promoting discovery which ought to be taken up and\r\nincorporated into general practice from one end of the country to the\r\nother, and which should be made a part of the minimum standard of\r\nmedical practice and medical agreement, must wait twenty-five or fifty\r\nyears for recognition.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE DISCIPLE OF FRESH AIR AND HOME INSTRUCTION IS\r\n    STILL AN OUTCAST IN SCORES OF HOSPITALS]\r\n\r\nFor want of a school of preventive medicine to emphasize universally\r\nevery new truth, the medical colleges are permitted to remain\r\ntwenty-five or fifty years behind absolutely demonstrated facts as to\r\nmedical truth and medical practice. In 1761 a German physician,\r\nAvenbruger, after discovering that different sounds revealed diseased\r\ntissue, used \"chest tapping\" in the diagnosis of lung trouble. In 1815\r\nLeannec discovered that sound from the chest was more distinct through\r\na paper horn. On that principle the modern stethoscope is built. He\r\nmade an accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, and while suffering from\r\nthat disease treated himself as a living clinical study. In 1857\r\nPasteur proved the presence of germs \"without which no putrefaction, no\r\nfermentation, no decay of tissue takes place.\" In 1884 Trudeau started\r\nthe first out-of-door care of pulmonary tuberculosis in America. In\r\n1892 Biggs secured the compulsory notification of pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis. In 1904 began our first out-of-door sea-air treatment for\r\nbone tuberculosis. Yet there are thousands of physicians to-day who\r\nsincerely believe that they are earning their fees, who, from houses\r\nshut up like ovens, give advice to patients for treatment of\r\ntuberculosis, who prescribe alcohol and drugs, who diagnose the disease\r\nas malaria for fear patients will be scared, who oppose compulsory\r\nregistration, and who never look for the tuberculous origin of crippled\r\nchildren. Just think of its being possible, in 1908, for a tuberculous\r\nyoung man of thirty to pay five dollars a day to a sanatorium whose\r\nchief reliance is six doses of drugs a day!\r\n\r\nIn 1766 America's first dentist came to the United States. By 1785\r\nitinerant dentists had built up a lucrative practice. In 1825 a course\r\nof lectures on dentistry was delivered before the medical class at the\r\nUniversity of Maryland. As early as 1742 treatises were written \"Upon\r\nDentition and the Breeding of Teeth in Children.\" In 1803 the\r\npossibility of correcting irregularities was pointed out, as was the\r\npernicious effect of tartar on the teeth in 1827. In 1838 attempts were\r\nmade to abolish, \"in all common cases, the pernicious habit of tooth\r\ndrawing.\" In 1841 treatises were written on the importance of\r\nregulating the teeth of children before the fourteenth year and on the\r\nimportance of preserving the first teeth. Yet in 1908 it is necessary\r\nto write the chapter on Dental Sanitation. Few physicians, whether in\r\nprivate practice or hospitals or just out of medical college, consider\r\nit necessary to know the conditions of the mouth before prescribing\r\ndrugs for physical illness.\r\n\r\nOsteopathy furnishes an up-to-date illustration. Discredited by the\r\nmedical profession, by medical journals and medical schools, it has in\r\nfifteen years built up a practice of eight thousand men, having from\r\none to three years' training, including over one hundred physicians\r\nwith full medical training plus a course in osteopathy. There were\r\nmeans of learning fifteen years ago what was truth and what was\r\nquackery about the practice of osteopathy. By refusing to look for its\r\ntruth and by concentrating attention upon its quackery the medical\r\nprofession has lost fifteen years. Whereas the truth of osteopathy\r\nshould have been adopted by the medical colleges and a knowledge of its\r\npossibilities and limitations required of every practicing physician, a\r\nposition has been reached where alleged quackery seems in several\r\nimportant points to be discrediting the sincerity, the intelligence,\r\nand the efficiency of orthodox medicine. No appeal to the natural can\r\nbe stronger, no justification of schools of preventive medicine more\r\ncomplete, than the following paragraph from an osteopathic physician\r\nwho is among the small number who, having both the medical and\r\nosteopathic degrees, see both the possibilities and limitations of\r\nmanual surgery and demand the inclusion of this new science in the\r\nmedical curriculum.\r\n\r\n  The physical method of treating disease presents a tremendous and\r\n  significant departure from the empiricism of medicine and the\r\n  experimentation of dietetics, the restricted fields of\r\n  electricity, suggestion, water cures, and massage. The patient as\r\n  an individual is not treated; the disease as a disease is not\r\n  treated; the symptoms are not treated; but the entire physical\r\n  organism, with its many parts and diverse functions, is\r\n  exhaustively examined until each and every abnormal condition,\r\n  whether of structure or of function, causing disease and\r\n  maintaining symptoms, is found and administered to with the skill\r\n  of a definite art, based upon the data of an exact science.\r\n\r\nLikewise the truths underlying Christian Science have been disdained by\r\nmedical schools and medical experts, just as its spiritual truth has\r\nbeen disdained by religious leaders, until it has grown to such\r\nstrength that laymen are almost forced to question the sincerity and\r\nthe efficacy of the conventional in religion as well as medicine. In\r\nMay, 1907, the Emmanuel Church in Boston organized a clinic for the\r\npurpose of utilizing for neurasthenics particularly both the spiritual\r\nand the physical truths underlying religion and the various branches of\r\nmedical science. Daily papers and magazines are giving a great deal of\r\nspace to this experiment in \"psychotherapy,\" which is discussed in the\r\nchapter on Mental Hygiene. Schools and chairs in preventive hygiene\r\nwould soon give to the medical profession a point of view that would\r\nwelcome every new truth, such as the alliance of religion and medicine,\r\nand estimate its full worth promptly. Truth seeking would be not only\r\nencouraged but made a condition of professional standing.\r\n\r\nJust what attitude any particular physician takes can be learned by the\r\nteacher or parents whose children he treats. If he pooh-poohs or\r\nresents board of health regulations as to isolation of scarlet-fever\r\npatients, he is a dangerous man, no matter how noble his personal\r\ncharacter. If he says cross-eyes will straighten, weak eyes will\r\nstrengthen, or nose-stopping adenoids \"absorb,\" he is bound to do harm.\r\nIf he says tuberculosis is incurable, noncommunicable, hereditary, or\r\ncurable by drugs, or if he tries to cure cancer by osteopathy, he can\r\ndo more injury than an insane criminal. If he fails to teach a mother\r\nhow to bathe, feed, and clothe the baby, how to ventilate a room for\r\nthe sick or the well, he is an expensive luxury for family or for\r\nschool, and belongs to an age that knew neither school nor preventive\r\nhygiene. If he takes no interest in health administration; if he\r\noverlooks unclean milk or unclean streets, open sewers, and unsanitary\r\nschool buildings, street cars, churches, and theaters; if he does not\r\nhelp the health board, the public hospitals, the schools, the factory,\r\nand tenement departments enforce sanitary laws, he is derelict as a\r\ncitizen and as a member of an \"exalted profession.\" If he sees only\r\nthe patients he himself treats or one particular malady, he is derelict\r\nas a teacher, no matter how charming his personality or how skilled in\r\nhis specialty. If a school physician is slovenly in his work, if he\r\nspends fifteen minutes when he is paid for an hour, should the\r\nefficient school-teacher conceal the fact from her superiors because he\r\nis a physician? If private hospitals misrepresent facts or compromise\r\nwith political evils for the sake of a gift of public money, their\r\noffense is more heinous because of their exalted purpose. The test of a\r\nphysician's worth to his patients and to his community is not what he\r\nis or what he has learned, and not what his profession might be, but\r\nwhat happens to patient and to community. Human welfare demands that\r\nthe medical profession be judged by what it does, not by what it might\r\ndo if it made the best possible use of its knowledge or its\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TOO MANY PHYSICIANS AND EVEN MATERNITY HOSPITALS\r\n    FAIL TO TEACH MOTHERS, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER BABIES ARE BORN\r\n    Caroline Rest Educational Fund was given to show the value of\r\n    such teaching]\r\n\r\nA dispensary that treats more patients than it can care for properly is\r\nno better than a street-car company that chronically provides too few\r\nseats and too many straps. Unless physicians test themselves and their\r\nprofession by results, we shall be compelled to \"municipalize the\r\nmedical man.\" Preventable sickness costs too much, causes too much\r\nwretchedness, and hampers too many modern educational and industrial\r\nactivities to be neglected. If the medical profession does not fit\r\nitself to serve general interests, then cities, counties, and states\r\nwill take to themselves the cure as well as the prevention of\r\ncommunicable and other preventable sickness. Human life and public\r\nhealth are more precious than the medical profession, more important\r\neven than theories and traditions against public interference in\r\nprivate matters. The unreasoning opposition of medical men to\r\ngovernment protection of health, their concentration on cure, and their\r\ntardy emphasis on prevention have forced many communities to stumble\r\ninto the evil practices mentioned in Chapter XVI. Incidentally, the\r\nbest physicians have learned that the prosperity of their profession\r\nincreases with every increase in the general standard of living. It is\r\nthe man in the ten-room house not the man in one room who supports\r\nphysicians in luxury. It is the healthy man and the healthy community\r\nthat value efficient medical service.\r\n\r\nMany American cities maintain dispensaries and hospitals for the poor.\r\nWhether they will go to the logical conclusion of engaging physicians\r\nto give free treatment to all regardless of income depends largely upon\r\nwhat the next generation of private physicians do. The state already\r\nsays when a physician's training fits him to practice. It will soon\r\nexpect him to pass rigid examinations in the social and economic\r\naspects of his profession,--its educational opportunity, vital\r\nstatistics, sick and death rates. Will it need to municipalize him in\r\norder to protect itself?\r\n\r\nObviously the teacher or parent should not begin cooperation with\r\nphysicians by lecturing them or by assuming that they are selfish and\r\nunwilling to teach. The best first step is to ask questions that they\r\nshould be able to answer:\r\n\r\n  What causes cholera morbus or summer complaint? When does milk\r\n  harm the baby? How can unclean milk be made safe? Whose fault is\r\n  it that the milk is sold unclean and too warm? What agencies help\r\n  sick babies? What is the health board doing to teach mothers?\r\n\r\nOr, if a school physician, the teacher can ask:\r\n\r\n  Why not remove these adenoids? What causes them? When will they\r\n  disappear by absorption? What harm can they do in the meantime?\r\n  How long would an operation take? Would it hurt very much? What\r\n  would be the immediate effects? Why not act at once? What\r\n  provisions are there in town for such operations? Why have the\r\n  physicians paid so little attention to breathing troubles? What\r\n  could your state do to interest physicians in school hygiene? Will\r\n  the school physician talk to a mothers' meeting? What agencies\r\n  will give outings to sick children? What dispensaries are\r\n  accessible? Who is the proper person to organize a public health\r\n  league?\r\n\r\nPhysicians love to teach. If teachers and parents will love to learn\r\nand will ask the right questions, all physicians can be converted into\r\nhygiene missionaries, heralds of a statesmanship that guarantees health\r\nrights to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSING THE PRACTITIONER\r\n\r\nThree parties are interested in setting a high standard for physicians,\r\ndentists, druggists, nurses, and veterinary surgeons--the profession\r\nitself, the schools that educate, and the general public on whom the\r\narts are practiced. The schools and the practitioners are, for the most\r\npart, primarily interested in protecting a monopoly of skill. Their\r\ninterest in restrictive legislation is analogous to that of the labor\r\nunion which limits the number of apprentices. This trade unionism among\r\nprofessional colleges and professional graduates of these colleges has\r\ngradually developed a higher and higher standard that results in\r\ngreater protection to the public. The first step is generally to demand\r\nthat all persons entering a profession after a given date shall prove\r\nto the state their ability to \"practice\" without injury to clients. It\r\nis almost impossible to get such laws through unless the original law\r\nexempts all persons by whatever name, who are practicing the art in\r\nquestion at the time the law is passed. Whether we are speaking of\r\nmedicine, law, dentistry, accountancy, osteopathy, or barbering, this\r\nhas been the history of compulsory restriction and of state\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nAs with regard to most other legislation, the enforcement of the law\r\nlags behind its definition. Moreover nothing is done after a man has\r\npassed a certain examination to see that he remains fit and safe to\r\ntreat the public. Because no supervision is provided except on the day\r\nof examination, it is possible for men and women to fill their brains\r\nfor a week or two weeks with the information necessary to pass what\r\ncoaches and tutors have learned will, in all probability, be asked.\r\nForever after, the public is left to protect itself. Out of this\r\ncondition have arisen the evil, unethical, and unprofessional practices\r\nrepresented particularly by painless dentists, by ignorant or dishonest\r\nphysicians, and by osteopaths and careless nurses.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for preventing these evils is discussed in Chapter XXIX.\r\nSuffice it here to present to parents and teachers the need for\r\nexamination in advance of certification that will show whether or not\r\nthose who make a livelihood by caring for others' health are equipped\r\nto mitigate rather than aggravate evils, and for further tests by which\r\nthe public can learn from time to time which, among those professional\r\nmen who are protected by the public against competition, continue to be\r\nsafe. Finally, if, as will be clearly seen, it is desirable that what\r\nwe call professional ethics persist and that self-advertisement be\r\ndiscouraged, society must, for its own protection, adopt some other\r\nmeans than epithets to correct the evils of self-advertisement and\r\nquackery. Even though we admit the responsibility of each citizen when\r\nhe goes to the house of a private practitioner who has made no other\r\neffort to lure him thither than to place a card in the window, it must\r\nbe seen that we cannot hold responsible for their choice men and women\r\nwho receive through newspapers, magazines, or circulars convincing\r\nnotices that Dr. So-and-So or the Integrity Company or the Peerless\r\nDental Parlor will place at their disposal, at prices within their\r\nreach, skill and devotion absolutely beyond their reach at the office\r\nof an efficient private practitioner. Some way must be found by which\r\ndepartments of health will currently impose tests of methods and\r\nresults upon physicians, opticians, pharmacists, manufacturers of\r\nmedicine, and dentists.\r\n\r\nAs laymen become more intelligent regarding their own bodies and\r\nhealthy living, it grows harder and harder for quacks and incompetents\r\nto mislead and exploit them. Better than any possible outside safeguard\r\nis hygienic living. Fortunately, we can all learn the simple tests of\r\nenvironment and of living necessary to the selection of physicians,\r\ndentists, and opticians, or other \"architects of health\" whose\r\nefficiency and integrity are beyond question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV. OFFICIAL MACHINERY FOR ENFORCING HEALTH RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS OF SCHOOL HYGIENE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"school hygiene\" generally suggests no other school than the\r\npublic school. State laws say nothing about compulsory hygiene in\r\nmilitary academies, ladies' seminaries, or other preparatory and\r\nfinishing schools. Yet when one thinks of it, one must conclude that\r\nthe right to health and to healthful school environment cannot\r\nequitably be confined to the children whose tuition is given at public\r\nexpense. There is a better way to check \"swollen\" fortunes than by\r\nruining the health of \"fortune's children.\" The waste and danger of\r\nslow-minded, noticeably inefficient children are no less when parents\r\nare rich than when parents are poor. There is no justification for\r\nneglecting the health of children in parochial schools, in private\r\nschools for the well-to-do or rich, or in commercial schools for the\r\nambitious youth of lower income strata. Nor has the commercial,\r\nparochial, private school, or college, any clearer right than the\r\npublic school to injure or to fail to promote pupils' health. So far as\r\nschool hygiene is advisable, so far as it is right to make hygiene\r\ncompulsory, its personal and social benefits should be shared by\r\nchildren of school age without regard to income, and its laws should be\r\nenforced by all teachers, principals, and officers that have to do\r\nwith school. In presenting a programme for school hygiene this chapter\r\nrefers to the hygiene taught, the hygiene practiced, the hygiene not\r\ntaught, and the hygiene not practiced in buildings and on grounds where\r\nchildren and youth are at school, whether these children are in\r\nkindergarten or high school, in reformatory or military academy, in\r\ncharitable school, or in finishing and preparing center for society's\r\njuniors.\r\n\r\nThe question of the local, state, and national machinery by which\r\nproper standards of school hygiene shall be made effective will be\r\ntaken up after we have considered individual steps in a comprehensive\r\nprogramme for school hygiene.\r\n\r\n1. _Thorough physical examination of all candidates for teachers'\r\npositions and periodic reexamination of accepted teachers._\r\n\r\nTeachers would be grateful to be told in time their own physical needs\r\nand the relations of their vitality to the vitality of their pupils.\r\nAre your teachers examined? Do they know the laws of health and the\r\nsigns of child health? Are they permitted to continue in schoolrooms\r\nafter tuberculosis is discovered? Are normal graduates given physical\r\ntests before being permitted to teach and before being permitted to\r\ngive four years to preparation for teaching?\r\n\r\n2. _Thorough physical examination of every single child in every single\r\nschool upon entering and periodically during school life._\r\n\r\nWe believe a vast number of things that \"ain't so\" about the health of\r\ncountry children as compared with city children, of private-school\r\nchildren as compared with public-school children. Where do we find more\r\ndegenerate men, physically and morally, than in so-called \"American\r\nsettlements,\" where, for generations, children have had all outdoors to\r\nplay in, except when in homes and schoolhouses that are seldom cleansed\r\nand seldom ventilated? Open mouths and closed minds clog the \"little\r\nred schoolhouse\"; there headaches do not suggest eye strain; there\r\ndeafness and running ears are frankly attributed to scarlet fever which\r\neverybody must have with all the other \"catching\" diseases, the earlier\r\nthe better; there colds begin in December and run until March, to the\r\nserious injury of attendance and promotion records; there bone\r\ntuberculosis is called \"knee trouble\" or \"spine trouble in the family\";\r\nthere boys like my little friend Fred count the bottles of cod-liver\r\noil they take to cure adenoids that could be removed in two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe index to community life and community living conditions should be\r\nread in the country, not only for the country's sake, but also for the\r\nsake of the city whose milk and water, poisoned in the country, cause\r\nthousands of deaths annually, besides annual sick bills exceeding many\r\ntimes over the Russell Sage and Carnegie Foundations, which we rightly\r\ncall munificent. Reading the index of private schools and colleges is\r\nimportant for their children and youth, but still more important for\r\nthe community upon which unbridled passion, inability to work or to\r\nspend properly, inconsequential thinking, mediaeval ideals of caste,\r\netc., can inflict greater injuries than can typhoid fever or cholera.\r\n\r\nThe physical record of each child should be kept from date of entrance\r\nto date of leaving school, showing condition at successive\r\nexaminations, absence because of illness, etc.\r\n\r\n3. _Thorough physical examination of children when leaving school, or\r\nwhen passing compulsory school age, as a condition to \"working papers\"\r\nand to \"coming out.\"_\r\n\r\nTo give working papers to children seriously handicapped by physical\r\ndefects is to buy future industrial trouble, hospital and poorhouse\r\nbills. A boy with adenoids, a girl with eye trouble, should not be\r\npermitted to begin the fight for self-support without at least being\r\nclearly shown that the correction of these defects will increase their\r\nearning power. At present a schoolgirl with incipient tuberculosis, or\r\npredisposed to that disease, can get working papers, go to a hammock or\r\ntobacco factory, work long hours, breathe bushels of dust, deplete her\r\nvitality, spread tuberculosis among her co-workers and home associates,\r\ninfect a tenement,--and all this without any help or advice or any\r\nprotection from society until she is too sick to work and her physician\r\nnotifies the health department that she is a danger center. We may\r\ndisagree about society's right to control a child's act after the\r\ndefects are discovered, but who will question society's duty to tell\r\nthat child and her parents the truth about her physical needs before it\r\naccepts her labor or permits her to \"enter society\"?\r\n\r\n4. _Supervision by physicians of hygiene practiced in schoolrooms and\r\non playgrounds._\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Maxwell, of New York City, and other educational leaders\r\nurge teachers to do their utmost to learn the physical conditions and\r\nhome environment of the individual child, and to fit school treatment\r\nto the individual possibilities and handicaps. But experience proves\r\nconclusively that try as they will, teachers and principals have\r\nneither the special knowledge nor the time to acquire the special\r\nknowledge requisite to use the facts disclosed by the physical\r\nexamination of school children. Physicians and nurses are needed, not\r\nso much for treating children, as for teaching children, parents,\r\nteachers, family and dispensary physicians.\r\n\r\nPrivate schools have visiting physicians who may be consulted; they\r\nneed physicians to supervise, with power to examine or to require\r\ncertificates of examination. The Committee on the Physical Welfare of\r\nSchool Children found that when a visitor was detailed for that purpose\r\nit was easy to secure the cooeperation of parents, teachers, family\r\nphysicians, dispensaries, school boards, and charitable societies. The\r\nHawthorne Club's school secretary has been similarly successful in\r\nBoston, as have those of Hartley House, Greenwich House, and the Public\r\nEducation Association in New York.\r\n\r\n5. _Restriction of study hours at school and at home to limits\r\ncompatible with health._\r\n\r\nWhether the hours of study at school and at home are excessive cannot\r\nbe learned from treatises on pedagogics or physiology. Because children\r\ndiffer in vitality as in ability to learn, the maximum limit for study\r\nhours should be determined by the individual child's physical\r\ncondition. When the Japanese went to war with Russia the highest\r\nauthority in the field was the army surgeon. To this fact was largely\r\ndue the astonishingly small amount of sickness and the high fighting\r\ncapacity and endurance of the Japanese, working under unfavorable\r\nconditions. No board of school superintendents or board of directors,\r\nno state superintendent of schools or college professor, has the right\r\nto compel or to allow study hours beyond the maximum compatible with\r\nthe individual student's physical condition and endurance. The\r\nphysician responsible for school hygiene should have an absolute veto\r\nupon any educational policy, method, or environment demonstrably\r\ndetrimental to children's vitality.\r\n\r\n6. _Establishment of a \"follow-up\" plan to insure action by parents to\r\ncorrect physical defects and to attend to physical needs._\r\n\r\nThe advantages of _getting things done_ over _doing things_ have been\r\nrepeatedly emphasized. In smaller cities and in rural districts it is\r\nparticularly important for schools to get things done better by\r\nexisting local agencies, such as churches, health and street-cleaning\r\ndepartments, hospitals, clinics, medical and sanitary societies, trade\r\nunions, young people's societies, and women's clubs. Where parents who\r\nhave been followed up and taught, obstinately or ignorantly refuse to\r\nattend to their children's needs, the segregation of the physically\r\ndefective or needy will encourage the cooeperation of children\r\nthemselves in persuading parents to act intelligently for the child's\r\nsake. No child wants to remain \"queer\" or \"dopey\" or behind his peers.\r\nThe city superintendent of schools for New York City has asked for laws\r\ncompelling parents to permit operations and punishing them for\r\nneglecting to take steps, within their power, to remove physical\r\ndefects discovered at school.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TEACHING A MOTHER TO CARE FOR ONE CHILD INSURES\r\n    BETTER CARE FOR ALL HER CHILDREN]\r\n\r\n7. _Physiological age should influence school classification and school\r\ncurriculum._ On this subject the studies of Dr. C. Ward Crampton,\r\nreferred to in the chapter on Vitality Tests, are invaluable and as\r\nconvincing as they are revolutionary. Scientists accept his proof that\r\nour present high school curriculum is ill adapted to a large proportion\r\nof children; the \"physiologically too young\" drop out; only the\r\nphysiologically mature succeed. The two physiological ages should be\r\ngiven different work. Children whose bodies yearn for pictures,\r\nmuscular and sense expression, should be given a chance in school for\r\nnormal development. Analysis should wait for action. Organized play and\r\nphysical training antedated physical examination in our schools. Like\r\nthe curriculum they often disregard physiological age, doing harm\r\ninstead of good. Facts as to physical condition and physiological\r\ndevelopment would enable us to utilize the momentum of these two to\r\nbroaden school hygiene and to insure proper physical supervision. Only\r\ngood would result from adopting Leipsic's plan of having school\r\nchildren examined without clothing, in the presence of parents if\r\nparents desire. Expensive? Not so expensive as high school \"mortality\"\r\ndue to maladjusted curriculums that force the great majority of boys\r\nand girls to drop out before graduation and ruin the health of a large\r\nfraction of those who remain.\r\n\r\n8. _Construction of school building and of curriculum so that, when\r\nproperly conducted, they shall neither produce nor aggravate physical\r\ndefects._\r\n\r\nWhen the state for its own protection compels a child to go to school,\r\nit pledges itself not to injure itself by injuring the child. Thousands\r\nof children are now being subjected to conditions in school far more\r\ninjurious than the factory and shop conditions against which the\r\nnational and state child labor committees have aroused universal\r\nindignation. Two illuminating studies of school buildings in New York\r\nCity were made last year by the Committee on the Physical Welfare of\r\nSchool Children, and later by the Board of Education. Similar studies\r\nshould be made of every schoolroom. Whereas our discussions of\r\nbuildings and curriculum have hitherto proceeded largely from abstract\r\nprinciples of light, ventilation, heating, and pedagogics, these two\r\nreports deal with rooms, equipment, courses of study, and school habits\r\nas they are, with obvious detrimental effects on child victims.\r\nNumerous questions that it is practicable to answer are given in\r\nChapter XIV.\r\n\r\nWhat and when to build can be better determined after we have learned\r\nthe what and the where of present equipment.\r\n\r\nIn passing it is worth while to note that in large cities teachers are\r\nfrequently forced to choose between bad ventilation and street noises.\r\nFrom Boston comes the suggestion that we avoid noises and evils of\r\ncongestion by building schoolhouses for city children on the outskirts\r\nin the midst of fields, transporting, and, if necessary, feeding\r\nchildren at public expense. While it is true that the public funds now\r\nspent in attempting to cure physical and moral ills would purchase\r\nample country reservations, the practical next step seems to be to\r\nprovide ample play space and breathing space within the city for every\r\nschool building already erected, and without fail for all buildings to\r\nbe erected hereafter.\r\n\r\n9. _Hygiene should be so taught that children will cultivate habits of\r\nhealth and see clearly the relation of health and vitality to present\r\nhappiness and future efficiency._ Social rather than personal, public\r\nrather than private, health needs emphasis. Children can be shown how\r\ntheir health affects their neighbor; why money spent for health boards\r\nis a better investment than money given to corrupt politicians; that\r\nthe cost of accepting Thanksgiving turkey or a park picnic from a\r\npolitical leader who encourages inefficient government is sickness,\r\nmisery, deficient schooling, lifelong handicap; that children and\r\nadults have health rights in school and factory, on street and\r\nplayground, which the law will protect if only they know when these\r\nrights are infringed.\r\n\r\n10. _Central supervision of school hygiene._ In private and public,\r\nboarding and day, country and city, reformatory and military,\r\ncommercial and high schools, the index--physical welfare of school\r\nchildren--should be read and interpreted. Headquarters should learn\r\nwhether or not physical examinations are made and whether harmful\r\nconditions are corrected. So far as public schools are concerned,\r\n\"headquarters\" means for cities the fact center that informs city\r\nsuperintendent or school board; for rural schools, it means the county\r\nsuperintendent's office. Whether city or county headquarters have the\r\nfacts and act accordingly should be known by state superintendents.\r\nWhether state superintendents are demanding the facts and educating the\r\ncounty and city headquarters of their states should be known to the\r\nnational commissioner of education and by him published for all the\r\nworld. Some people think the state health board should be responsible,\r\nothers the state educational authority. The important thing is to make\r\nsome one officer responsible. Methods can be easily worked out if the\r\nneed is conceded. Legislatures will gladly confer the powers necessary\r\nto reading the index of all public schools.\r\n\r\nAs for parochial and private schools, they may resent for a time public\r\nsupervision of their hygiene teaching and practice. However, the case\r\ncould be so presented that they would ask for it, because it would help\r\nnot only their pupils and society but the schools themselves. No\r\nreligious belief or private investment can afford to admit that it\r\ndisregards child health; state supervision would require nothing more\r\nthan evidence of adequate school hygiene.\r\n\r\n11. _Information gained at school regarding conditions prejudicial to\r\ncommunity health should be published and made the basis of an\r\naggressive campaign for the enforcement of sanitary laws._ Ten thousand\r\nuses can be made of the information gained at school, ten thousand\r\nforces can be made to do educational work, but only a few kinds of work\r\ncan be done effectively at school. Franklin Ford has said: \"You can\r\nrelate school to all life, but you cannot bring all life under the\r\nschool roof.\" As Chapters XVI-XVIII make clear, to socialize the point\r\nof view of dispensaries and hospitals is more effective than to put\r\nclinics in school buildings. To _do for_ or _give to_ people who can\r\nhelp themselves is to _give up_ and _do up_ power of self-help.\r\n\r\nMachinery that must some day exist for the execution of this programme\r\nwill be approximately the following:\r\n\r\n  I. NATIONAL MACHINERY\r\n\r\n  1. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene as taught and\r\n  practiced in all schools under the Stars and Stripes; this to be a\r\n  part of the National Bureau of Education.\r\n\r\n  2. Scientific research to be conducted by the National Bureau of\r\n  Education or by the future National Board of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. STATE MACHINERY\r\n\r\n  1. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and\r\n  practiced in all schools within state limits; this to be\r\n  maintained by the state educational authorities.\r\n\r\n  2.

Agents to inspect and to instruct county superintendents,\r\n  county physicians, teachers, normal schools, etc.\r\n\r\n  4. A bureau of experts--architect, sanitarian, teacher--whose\r\n  approval must be obtained before any school building can be\r\n  erected.

Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and\r\n  practiced in all schools within county limits; this to be\r\n  maintained by the county superintendent of schools.\r\n\r\n  2. Physician and nurse to organize inspection and instruction for\r\n  rural schools, to give lessons and make demonstrations at county\r\n  institutes, to show teachers how to interest physicians, dentists,\r\n  health officers, and parents in the physical welfare of school\r\n  children.\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV. TOWN AND TOWNSHIP MACHINERY\r\n\r\n  1. Teachers intelligent as to physical needs, as to sanitation of\r\n  buildings, etc.\r\n\r\n  2. An examining physician, to be salaried where the population\r\n  justifies; elsewhere to work as a volunteer in cooeperation with\r\n  teacher and with county physician.\r\n\r\n  3. Physical history of each child from date of entrance to date of\r\n  leaving school, to be kept up to date by teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n  V. CITY MACHINERY\r\n\r\n  1. A division to be known as the Department of School Hygiene,\r\n  headed by an officer who gives his entire time to that department.\r\n\r\n  2. A subcommittee of the Board of Education.\r\n\r\n  3. Clearing house for facts regarding school hygiene taught and\r\n  practiced in all schools within city limits.\r\n\r\n  4. Specialists to examine applicants for teaching positions, and\r\n  to reexamine teachers to determine fitness for continuance, for\r\n  promotion, and for special assignments.\r\n\r\n  5. A bureau for inspection and control of all hygiene of school\r\n  buildings, old and new, with power to compel repairs or to reject\r\n  plans that do not make adequate sanitary provision.\r\n\r\n  6. Similar supervision of curriculum and of study hours\r\n  prescribed.\r\n\r\n  7. A bureau for the inspection and control of curriculum, required\r\n  home study, exercise, physical training, etc., so far as relates\r\n  to the health of pupils, and to the physical ability of children\r\n  to be in certain grades or to be promoted. This will decide the\r\n  duration of lessons, frequency of intermissions, sequence of\r\n  subjects, time and method of recess throughout the various grades.\r\n\r\n  8. Supervision of indoor and outdoor playgrounds, roof gardens,\r\n  indoor and outdoor gymnasiums, swimming pools, etc.\r\n\r\n  9. Supervision of instruction in school hygiene.\r\n\r\n  10. A staff of inspectors for communicable diseases of pupils and\r\n  teachers, to be subject to the board of education or the board of\r\n  health.\r\n\r\n  11. A staff of examiners adequate to examine all children and\r\n  teachers at least once a year for defects of eye, ear, teeth,\r\n  nose, throat, lungs, spine, bones, glands, etc., and for weight\r\n  and height to be under the control of the board of education or\r\n  the board of health. The expense would not be as great as the\r\n  penalty paid for omitting such examination.\r\n\r\n  12. A staff of nurses to assist medical examiners to give children\r\n  practical demonstrations in cleanliness, to teach mothers the care\r\n  of children both at their homes and in mothers' meetings, to\r\n  enlist the cooeperation of family physician and neighborhood\r\n  facilities, such as hospitals, dispensaries and relief agencies,\r\n  magistrates' courts and probation officers,--all to be under the\r\n  control of the board of education or the board of health.\r\n\r\nWhether inspectors, examiners, and nurses shall be directed by the\r\nboard of education or the board of health is a question that it is\r\nimpossible to decide without knowledge of local conditions. So far as\r\nstate and county organizations are concerned, it is clear that whatever\r\nthe boards of health may do, it will be necessary for state and county\r\nsuperintendents of education to equip themselves with the machinery\r\nabove recommended. In cities it is quite clear that a board of\r\neducation should be responsible for all of the machinery suggested,\r\nexcepting the three divisions that have to do with work hitherto\r\nconsidered as protection against transmissible diseases, namely,\r\ninspection, examination, district visiting. In Cleveland these are\r\nschool duties. In New York they are duties of the health department.\r\nBoston has school nurses and health department physicians. The state\r\nlaw of Massachusetts provides that where health boards do not examine\r\nschool children, school boards may spend money for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs to inspection for transmissible diseases, it seems quite clear that\r\nhealth boards should not delegate their authority or responsibility to\r\nany other body, for they alone are accountable to their communities for\r\nprotection against contagion. It is clear, too, that in the interest of\r\ncommunity health, departments of health are justified in pointing out\r\nin advance of contagion those children most likely to become a menace.\r\nSimilar grounds of public interest justify the health boards in sending\r\nnurses and physicians to the home as a means of getting things done.\r\n\r\nDr. Biggs feels that responsibility for the physical welfare of school\r\nchildren will strengthen health work in all cities, and, given proper\r\ninterest on the part of school officials, should make possible\r\nuniversal cooeperation in a constructive programme. On the other hand,\r\nhe believes that division of responsibility between school and health\r\nboards will weaken both in their appeals for funds and for support of a\r\nconstructive programme. I have heard principals and superintendents\r\nmaintain also that the moral effect of a visit to the school by a\r\nrepresentative of the health board vested with powers of that board was\r\nmuch greater than a visit by a representative of the school board. They\r\nfurther allege that a physician coming from the outside is more apt to\r\nsee things that need correction and less apt to accept excuses than an\r\ninspector who feels that he belongs to the same working group as the\r\nschool-teacher. Because the follow-up work in the homes incident to\r\nsuccessful use of knowledge gained at school involves so many sanitary\r\nremedies, it is theoretically better organization to hold the health\r\nauthority responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nPRESENT ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL HYGIENE IN NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the elements of the machinery outlined in the preceding chapter\r\nalready exist in New York City. All of them brought together, either by\r\namalgamation or by proper cooerdination, would present a very strong\r\nfront. Unfortunately, however, there is not only unsatisfactory team\r\nwork, but the efficiency of individual parts is seriously questioned by\r\nthe heads of the health and school departments.\r\n\r\nThe inspection for contagious diseases, the examination for physical\r\ndefects, the follow-up work by nurses and physicians, are in charge of\r\nthe department of health. Physical training and athletics for\r\nelementary and high schools, winter recreation centers, and vacation\r\nplaygrounds are under directors and assistants employed by the board of\r\neducation. Heretofore inadequate powers and inadequate assistance for\r\ntraining or for research have been given to the physical director.\r\n\r\nThe city superintendent of schools, in his report for the year 1907,\r\npresented to the board of education in January, 1908, declares that the\r\n\"present arrangements have been inadequate.... In only 248\r\nschools--less than half the total number--were any examinations for\r\npossible diseases made. In these 248 schools not more than one third of\r\nthe pupils were examined. It is only a few months since any\r\nexaminations for physical defects were made outside of the boroughs of\r\nManhattan and The Bronx, and then only on account of the New York\r\nCommittee on the Physical Welfare of School Children.\"\r\n\r\nAs is so often the case, it is difficult to decide the merits of a\r\nmethod that has not been efficiently executed. The department of health\r\nhas not hitherto done its best in its school relations. The\r\ncommissioner of health, in a public interview, expresses resentment at\r\nthe strictures by the school authorities. Yet in 1907 he permitted to\r\naccumulate an unexpended balance of $33,000 specifically voted for\r\nschool inspectors, and repeatedly tried to have this amount transferred\r\nto other purposes. The interest of the Bureau of Municipal Research in\r\nmunicipal budgets that tell for what purposes money is voted and then\r\nprevent transfers without full publicity, preserved this particular\r\nfund. Moreover, the discussion that prevented its diversion from\r\nphysical examinations strengthened the health department's interest in\r\nthis important responsibility. Neither physicians nor nurses have been\r\nadequately supervised. Instead of seeing that defects were removed, the\r\ndepartment of health sent out postal cards like the following:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Notice Example)]\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |         \"This Notice Does NOT Exclude This Child From School\"         |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n |                          DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH                         |\r\n |                          THE CITY OF NEW YORK                         |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n |                            _Oct. 2, 190_6_                            |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n | The parent or guardian of ___________________________________________ |\r\n |  of____________________________________attending P.S.__51___________  |\r\n | is hereby informed that a physical examination of this child seems to |\r\n | show an abnormal condition of the ___________________________________ |\r\n | ___Eyes, Nose, Throat and Teeth______________________________________ |\r\n | _____________________________________________________________________ |\r\n | Remarks__Is Anaemic__________________________________________________ |\r\n | _____________________________________________________________________ |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n | Take this child to your family physician for treatment and advice.    |\r\n | Take this card with you to the family physician.                      |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n |                                       THOMAS DARLINGTON, M.D.,        |\r\n |                                               Commissioner of Health. |\r\n |                                                                       |\r\n | HERMANN M.

The\r\nbureau's study is entitled _A Bureau of Child Hygiene_, and, in\r\naddition to the story of medical examination in New York City schools,\r\ngives the blank forms adopted for use in September, 1908. Important as\r\nare the facts given in this study, its greatest value, its authors\r\ndeclare, is in its account of \"the method of intelligent self-criticism\r\nand experiment which alone enables a public department to keep its\r\nservice abreast of public needs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Municipal Research made its study for the purpose of\r\nlearning whether the disappointing results emphasized by the school\r\nauthorities were due to \"dual responsibility in the school--that of the\r\nboard of education and that of the department of health\"--and to \"lack\r\nof power or inclination to compel parents to remedy defects,\" or to\r\n_deficient administration_ of power and inclination by health\r\nofficials. Cooeperating with school physicians and nurses in three\r\nschools, 1442 children were examined, of whom 1345, or 93.2 per cent,\r\nhad 3458 defects that needed treatment. The postal-card notice was\r\nfollowed by an interview with the parent either at school or at home.\r\nOnly 4.2 per cent of the total number of parents refused to act, 81 per\r\ncent secured or permitted treatment for one or more defects, while 15\r\nper cent promised to take the proper steps at the earliest possible\r\ndate. Three fourths of the parents acted after one personal interview.\r\n\"The net average result of a day's work by a nurse was the actual\r\ntreatment of over five children, three of them completely, and two of\r\nthem for one or more defects,\"--sixty cents per child!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A PHOTOGRAPH OF MOUTH BREATHING MAY MAKE\r\n    COMPULSION UNNECESSARY]\r\n\r\nHaving established the willingness--even eagerness--of parents to do\r\nall in their power to remove defects that handicapped their children,\r\nit was obviously the duty of the health department so to organize its\r\nwork that it could insure the education of parents. The new Bureau of\r\nChild Hygiene gives foremost place to instruction of parents in care of\r\nbabies, in needs of school children, and in the importance of physical\r\nexamination when enlisting in the industrial army. Whether this work is\r\nwell done is learned by result tests applied at headquarters, where\r\nwork done and results are reported daily and summarized weekly. No\r\nlonger will it be possible, without detection, for one physician to\r\nfind only eye trouble and to neglect all other defects; for two\r\ninspectors examining different children in the same school to report\r\nresults differing by 100 per cent; for physicians in different schools\r\nto find one 18 per cent, another 100 per cent with defects; for two\r\ninspectors examining identical children to agree on 51 out of 101 cases\r\nof vision, on 49 out of 96 cases of adenoids, or 3 out of 10 cases of\r\nskin disease.\r\n\r\nSo conclusive were the results of follow-up work efficiently supervised\r\nby the department of health, that school officials are, for the\r\npresent, inclined to waive the demand for the transfer of physicians\r\nand nurses to the board of education, and to substitute education for\r\ncompulsion with parents who obstinately refuse to take proper remedial\r\nmeasures for their children when reported defective.\r\n\r\nThis present plan requires the entire working time of inspectors and\r\nnurses for school work. Thus New York has for the present definitely\r\nabandoned the plan of having the district inspection for contagious\r\ndiseases done by school physicians. The purpose of the change is not to\r\nreduce danger of infection, which was negligible, but to increase the\r\nprobability of scientific attention to school children.\r\n\r\nBefore a final settlement is made for New York City there should be\r\ntests showing what the school authorities would do if physicians and\r\nnurses were subordinate to them. It is conceivable that one physician\r\nworking from nine to five would accomplish more than six physicians\r\nworking the alleged three hours a day. So imperative are the demands of\r\nschool hygiene that it seems probable that in New York and in other\r\nlarge cities school physicians, whether paid by the board of health or\r\nthe board of education, must be expected to be at the service of school\r\nchildren, subject to the call of school officers, during as many hours\r\nof the day as teachers themselves must give. It is even conceivable\r\nthat effective use of the knowledge gained by physical examinations of\r\nschool children, and by those responsible for school hygiene, will\r\nrequire evening office hours or evening visits to homes, and regular\r\nSaturday office hours and Saturday visits by school physicians and\r\nnurses. Finally, it must be expected that the programme for school\r\nhygiene will need the special attention of physicians and nurses during\r\nthe summer months, and other vacation periods when children and parents\r\nalike have time to receive and to carry out their instructions.\r\n\r\nOne danger in New York City is that the board of education, like the\r\nboard of health, when compelled to choose between so-called standard,\r\nnecessary, traditional duty and school hygiene, will sacrifice the\r\nlatter. The school authorities, without any more funds and without\r\nphysicians and nurses, could already have made, had they desired, eye\r\ntests and breathing tests sufficiently accurate to detect the majority\r\nof children needing attention. The outcome of the discussion as to the\r\njurisdiction of the two boards will undoubtedly be to interest both in\r\ntheir joint responsibility for children's welfare, and to increase the\r\nattention given by both to the physical condition of the child when he\r\npresents himself for registration as a wage earner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL MACHINERY FOR ENFORCING HEALTH RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument for _getting things done_ presumes adequate active\r\nmachinery, official and private, for _doing things_ that schools are\r\nbeing urged to do. The chapter on Departments of School Hygiene\r\nsuggests local, county, state, and national machinery necessary (1) to\r\nprotect the child from injuries due to school environment, school\r\nmethods, and school curriculum; (2) to getting those things done for\r\nthe child at home and on the street, need for which is disclosed by\r\nphysical and vitality tests at school. It is unreasonable to confine\r\nthe school to the activities above outlined unless health machinery,\r\nadequate to the demands placed upon it by school and other community\r\nneeds, is devised and kept in order.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, adequate health machinery is already provided for\r\nby city charters and by the state laws under which villages, townships,\r\nand counties are organized. Quite as generally, however, machinery and\r\nmethods of adequate administration are undeveloped. How much machinery\r\nhas already been set to work by New York City is shown by the\r\naccompanying chart. A useful exercise for individuals or school classes\r\nwishing to study health administration would be to chart in this way\r\nthe machinery actually at work in their locality, county, and state.\r\nEven for New York it should be remembered that this chart does not\r\ninclude national quarantine, the state protection of the port, the\r\nstate dairy and health commissions, or the state and national food\r\ninspection. To get an idea of the vast amount of attention given\r\nto health in New York City there should be added to this chart the work\r\nof many departments other than the department of health. The building\r\nbureau, tenement-house department, board of water supply, sewage\r\ncommission, street cleaning, public baths and comfort stations, the\r\ndepartment of water, gas, and electricity, and finally the department\r\nof hygiene and physical training in the public schools.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHART SHOWING HOW NEW YORK CITY'S DEPARTMENT OF\r\n    HEALTH EXERCISES IT'S AUTHORITY\r\n    Courtesy of Bureau of Municipal Research]\r\n\r\nFive elements of adequate machinery are generally lost sight of:\r\n\r\n  1. The voter.\r\n\r\n  2. The nonvoter, subject to health laws and often apt to violate\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  3. The mayor, governor, or president who appoints health officers.\r\n\r\n  4. The council, board of aldermen, legislature, or congress that\r\n  enacts health laws.\r\n\r\n  5. The police courts and the judiciary--police, circuit and\r\n  supreme--that decide whether society has suffered from violation\r\n  of law and what penalties should be inflicted for such violation.\r\n\r\nLegislative bodies have hitherto slighted their responsibilities toward\r\npublic health. The chairman of a committee on public health of a state\r\nlegislature was heard to remark, \"I asked for that committee because\r\nthere isn't a blooming thing to do.\" If voters, nonvoters, and health\r\nofficials will follow the suggestion of this book to secure school and\r\nhealth reports that will disclose community and health needs, it will\r\nbe increasingly difficult for legislators to refuse funds necessary to\r\nefficient health administration.\r\n\r\nTo the courts tradition has required such deference that one hesitates\r\nto find out in how far they have been responsible in the past for the\r\nnonenforcement of health laws. Yet nothing is more obstructive of\r\nsanitary progress than the failure of magistrates to enforce adequate\r\npenalties for truancy, adulteration of milk, maintaining a public\r\nnuisance, defiling the air with black smoke, offering putrid meats for\r\nsale, running an unclean lodging house, defying tenement-house or\r\nfactory regulations, working children under age and overtime, spitting\r\nin public places, or failing to register transmissible diseases.[16]\r\n\r\nThe appointing officer cannot, of course, be held responsible unless\r\nvoters and nonvoters know in how far his appointees are inefficient,\r\nand in how far he himself has failed to do his utmost to secure funds\r\nnecessary to efficiency. Too frequently appointments to health\r\npositions have been made on political grounds, and catastrophes have\r\nbeen met by blundering incapacity. The political appointee has been\r\nmade the scapegoat, and the appointing officer, whether mayor,\r\ngovernor, or president, has regained public confidence by replacing an\r\nold with a new incompetent.\r\n\r\nIn order to have health machinery work properly, the appointing officer\r\nshould not be allowed to shift responsibility for failure to his\r\nsubordinates. For example, it was recently found in New York City that\r\nwhile the tenement-house commissioner was being condemned for failing\r\nto enforce the law, he had turned over to the corporation counsel, also\r\nappointed by the mayor, for prosecution ten thousand \"violations\" to\r\nwhich no attention whatever had been paid!\r\n\r\nThe voter, nonvoter, appointing officer, legislative officer, and\r\njudicial officer determine the character and purpose of machinery and\r\nare analogous to the surveyors, stock-holders, directors, and\r\nconstructors who provide railroads with tracks and with running stock.\r\nThe actual running force of health department or railroad is what is\r\nmeant by its official machinery. What this machinery should be depends,\r\nof course, upon the amount of business to be done, and differs with\r\nthe size of the district and the character of population to be served.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FOR PUSH-CART FOOD, INSPECTION IS PARTICULARLY\r\n    NEEDFUL]\r\n\r\nLocal health machinery should guarantee protection against the evils\r\nmentioned in preceding chapters. In general, one man is better than\r\nthree to execute, although three may be better than one to legislate.\r\nWhere small communities do not wish to have the entire state sanitary\r\ncode rigidly administered, they can adopt New York's method of a\r\nlegislative board of three members, headed by an executive, whose\r\nbusiness it is to act, not talk; to watch subordinates, and to enforce\r\nrigidly and continuously ordinances passed by the board. The National\r\nBureau of Census places under the general heading Health and Sanitation\r\nthe following activities: health administration, street cleaning and\r\nrefuse disposal, sewers and sewage disposal. Sanitarians generally\r\nemphasize also the health significance of efficient water service.\r\n\r\nA community's health programme should be clearly outlined in the annual\r\nbudget. Where health work is given funds without specification of the\r\nkinds of work to be done, serious evils may be overlooked and lesser\r\nevils permitted to monopolize the energies of health officers. Again,\r\nafter money has been voted to prevent an evil, records should be made\r\nof work done when done, and of money spent when spent, so that any\r\ndiversion will be promptly made known. The best present guides to\r\nbudget making, to educational health reports, and to records that show\r\nefficiency or inefficiency of health administrators are the budget and\r\nreport of the department of health for New York City, and the story of\r\ntheir evolution told in _Making a Municipal Budget_, by the Bureau of\r\nMunicipal Research.\r\n\r\nTo find out whether local machinery is adequate, the reader must\r\nenumerate the things that need to be done in his community, remembering\r\nthat in all parts of the United States to-day there are sanitary laws\r\noffering protection against dangers to health, excepting some dangers\r\nnot understood until recently, such as child labor, dangerous trades,\r\nlack of safety devices. Adequate local protection, however, will not\r\nbecome permanent until adequate state machinery is secured.\r\n\r\nState health machinery should be of two kinds,--fact-gathering and\r\nexecutive supervision through inspection. The greatest service of state\r\nboards of health is to educate localities as to their own needs, using\r\nthe experience of all communities to teach each community in how far\r\nits health administration menaces itself and its neighbors. In addition\r\nto registration of contagious diseases, facts as to deaths and births\r\nshould be registered. State health boards should \"score\" communities as\r\ndairies and milk shops are now being scored by the National Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industries and several boards of health. When communities\r\npersist in maintaining a public nuisance and in failing to enforce\r\nhealth laws, state health machinery should be made to accomplish by\r\nforce what it has failed to accomplish by education.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NATIONAL MACHINERY HAS STIMULATED LOCAL MILK\r\n    INSPECTION AND STATE DAIRY INSPECTION]\r\n\r\nStates alone can cope adequately with dangers to milk and water sources\r\nand to food. The economic motive of farmers has developed strong\r\nveterinary boards for the protection of cattle. Similar executive\r\nprecaution must soon be taken by cities for the protection of babies\r\nand adults of the human species. It is far more economical to insure\r\nclean dairies, clean water sources, and wholesome manufactured foods by\r\nstate inspectors than by local inspectors. At present the task of\r\nobtaining clean milk and clean water falls upon the few cities\r\nenlightened enough and rich enough to finance the inspection of\r\ncommunity foods. Once tested, it would be very easy to prove that\r\nproperly supported state health authorities will save many times the\r\ncost of their health work in addition to thousands of lives.\r\n\r\nCounty or district machinery is little known in America. For that\r\nreason rural sanitary administration is neglected and rural hospitals\r\nare lacking. In the British Isles rural districts are given almost as\r\ncareful inspection as are cities. Houses may not be built below a\r\ncertain standard of lighting, ventilation, and conveniences.\r\nOutbuildings must be a safe distance from wells. Dairies must be kept\r\nclean. Patients suffering from transmissible diseases may be removed by\r\nforce to hospitals. What is more to the point, rural hospitals have\r\nproved that patients cared for by them are far more apt to recover than\r\npatients cared for much more expensively and less satisfactorily at\r\nhome, while less likely to pollute water and milk sources or otherwise\r\nto endanger health.\r\n\r\nWith national machinery the chapter on Vital Statistics has already\r\ndealt. We shall undoubtedly soon have a national board of health. Like\r\nthe state boards, its first function should be educative. In addition,\r\nhowever, there are certain administrative functions where inefficiency\r\nmay result in serious losses to nation, state, and locality. National\r\nquarantine, national inspection of meats, foods, and drugs are\r\nadministrative functions of vital consequence to every citizen.\r\nAuthorities are acquainted at the present time with the fact that the\r\nsanitary administration of the army and navy is unnecessarily and\r\nwithout excuse wasteful of human energy and human life. In the Spanish\r\nAmerican War 14 soldiers died of disease for 1 killed in battle; in the\r\nCivil War 2 died of disease to 1 killed in battle; during the wars of\r\nthe last 200 years 4 have died of disease for 1 killed in battle. Yet\r\nJapan in her war with Russia, by using means known to the United States\r\nArmy in 1860, gave health precedence over everything else and lost but\r\n1 man to disease for 4 killed in battle. Diseases are still permitted\r\nto make havoc with American commerce because the national government\r\ndoes not apply to its own limits the standards which it has\r\nsuccessfully applied to Cuba and Panama.\r\n\r\n\"The Japanese invented nothing and had no peculiar knowledge or skill;\r\nthey merely took occidental science and used it. The remarkable thing\r\nis not what they did, but that they were allowed to do it. It is a\r\nterrible thing that Congress should choose to make one of its rare\r\ndisplays of economy in a matter where a few thousand dollars saved\r\nmeans, in case our army should have anything to do, not only the\r\nutterly needless and useless loss of thousands of lives, but an\r\nenormous decrease of military efficiency, and might, conceivably, make\r\nall the difference between victory and defeat.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] The technic and principles of municipal engineering have been\r\ntreated in detail in _Principles of Sanitary Science and the Public\r\nHealth_, by William T. Sedgwick, and in _Municipal Sanitation in the\r\nUnited States_, by Charles N. Chapin, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nSCHOOL AND HEALTH REPORTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor every school-teacher or school physician responsible for the\r\nwelfare of children at school, there are fifty or more parents\r\nresponsible for the physical welfare of children at home. Therefore it\r\nis all important for parents to know how to read the index for their\r\nown children, for their children's associates, and for their community.\r\nSchool reports and health reports should tell clearly and completely\r\nthe story of the school child's physical needs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NECESSARY TO EFFICIENT DEMOCRACY]\r\n\r\nIt is impracticable at the present time to expect a large number of men\r\nand women to be interested in the reports published by school and\r\nhealth boards, for, with few exceptions, little effort is made to write\r\nthese reports so that they will interest the parent. Fortunately, a\r\nsmall number of persons wishing to be intelligent can compel public\r\nofficials to ascertain the necessary facts and to give them to the\r\npublic. So backward is the reporting of public business that at the\r\npresent time there is probably no service that a citizen can render his\r\ncommunity which would prove of greater importance than to secure proper\r\npublicity from health and school boards.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, these published reports fail to interest the\r\ncitizen, not because officials wish to conceal, but because officials\r\ndo not believe that the public is interested. A mayor of Philadelphia\r\nonce furnished a notable exception. He called at the department of\r\nhealth and complained against publishing the number of cases of typhoid\r\nand smallpox lest stories in the newspapers \"frighten the city and\r\ninjure business.\" A sanitary inspector who was in the room asked if\r\nPhiladelphia's business was more important than the health of\r\nPhiladelphia's citizens. As a result of her \"impertinence\" the\r\ninspector was removed. That same year an epidemic of smallpox spread\r\nthrough all the rural districts and cities of Pennsylvania, because\r\nphysicians thought it would be kinder to the patients not to make known\r\nto their neighbors the presence of so disagreeable a disease. Almost\r\nall health and school authorities, however, can be made to see the\r\nadvantage of taking the public into their confidence, because public\r\nconfidence means both public recognition and greater success in\r\nobtaining funds. With more funds comes the power to do more work.\r\n\r\nOther details with regard to health reports will be found in the\r\nchapter on Vital Statistics. As to school reports, little thought has\r\nbeen given in the past to their educational possibilities. A book was\r\nrecently published--_School Reports and School Efficiency_--by the\r\nCommittee on the Physical Welfare of School Children, which tells the\r\norigins of school reports; contains samples of reports from one hundred\r\ncities; gives lists of questions frequently answered, occasionally\r\nanswered, and never answered; and shows how to study a particular\r\nreport so as to learn whether or not important questions are answered.\r\nThe United States commissioner of education has organized among state\r\nand city superintendents special committees on uniform and adequate\r\nreporting. His aggressive leadership is welcomed by school men\r\ngenerally, and promises vast benefits.\r\n\r\nJust because the physical welfare of the school child is an index to\r\nhealth needs, the school report can put into one statement for a city\r\nor a state the story told by the index. The accompanying card tells\r\nfacts that the individual teacher and individual parent want to know\r\nabout a child, what a superintendent wants to know about all children,\r\nand what a community wants to know about all children. A modification\r\nof this card will soon be adopted in New York City. It is both a card\r\nindex and a card biography of the individual boy or girl. It is\r\nexpected to follow the child from class to class, each teacher telling\r\nthe story of his physical welfare and his progress. When the boy goes\r\nto a new school or new grade, his new teacher can see at a glance not\r\nonly what subjects have given him trouble, but what diseases or\r\nphysical defects have kept him out of school or otherwise retarded his\r\nprogress. With this card it is easy to take a hundred children of the\r\nsame age and the same grade, to put down in one column those who have\r\neye defects, and in another those who have no eye defects, for every\r\nschool, every district, and for the schools as a whole. Schools that\r\nuse these record cards are enabled, by thus classifying the total, to\r\nlearn where the defects of children are, how serious the problem is,\r\nhow many days children lose from school because of preventable defects,\r\nand in what section of the city the defects are most prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe mere reporting of facts will stimulate teachers, principals, and\r\nparents to give attention. For example, assume a table:\r\n\r\n           FIELD OF INSPECTION\r\n\r\n Total number of public schools              7\r\n Public schools under inspection             3\r\n Public schools not under inspection         4\r\n\r\nThe reader wonders why four schools are neglected and which particular\r\nschools they are. Let the next table read:\r\n\r\n           EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n Total registration in all schools        1500\r\n Number of children examined               500\r\n Number of children not examined          1000\r\n\r\nParents begin to wonder whether or not their children were examined,\r\nand why the taxes spent for school examination of all children go to\r\none third of the children. The next table arrests attention:\r\n\r\n           TREATMENT\r\n\r\n Number needing treatment                  200\r\n Number known to have been treated          50\r\n Number not known to have been treated     150\r\n\r\nWe ask, at once, if examination is worth while, and if treatment really\r\ncorrects the defects, saves the pupil's time and teacher's time,\r\ndiscovers many defects; and we want to find out whether the one hundred\r\nand fifty reported not treated have since been attended to.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PUPIL'S RECORD]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CITY OF NEW YORK REPORT]\r\n\r\nAgain, if three out of five of those examined need treatment, people\r\nwill wonder whether among the thousand not examined there is the same\r\nproportion--three out of five, or six hundred--who have some trouble\r\nthat needs attention. Having begun to wonder, they will ask questions,\r\nand will expect the board of health or the school physicians to see\r\nthat the questions are answered. As has been proved in New York,\r\ntaxpayers and the press will go farther and will demand that the annual\r\nbudget provide for making general next year the benefits found to\r\nresult last year from a test of health policies.\r\n\r\nThe story of the prevalence of contagious diseases in school children\r\ncould be told by a table such as is now in use by New York's department\r\nof

have enough seats, proper\r\nventilation, adequate medical inspection, safe drinking water, ample\r\nplay space, and what schools are without these necessities is to cause\r\nthe reader to rank the particular school that he happens to know; i.e.\r\nhe says, \"School A is better equipped than School B; or, School C is\r\nneglected.\" County and state superintendents in many states have\r\nacquired the habit of ranking schools according to the number of\r\nchildren who pass in arithmetic, algebra, etc. It would greatly further\r\nthe cause of public health and, at the same time, advance the interest\r\nof education if state superintendents would rank individual schools,\r\nand if county superintendents would rank individual schools, _according\r\nto the number of children found to have physical defects, the number\r\nafflicted with contagious diseases, and the number properly treated_.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to compare one school with another, because it is\r\nnecessary to make subtractions and divisions and to reduce to\r\npercentages. It would not be so serious for a school of a thousand\r\npupils as for a school of two hundred, to report 100 for adenoids. To\r\nmake it possible to compare school with school without judging either\r\nunfairly, the state superintendent of schools for Connecticut has made\r\ntables in which cities are ranked according to the number of pupils,\r\naverage attendance, per capita cost, etc. As to each of these headings,\r\ncities are grouped in a manner corresponding to the line up of a\r\nbattalion, \"according to height.\" A general table is then shown, which\r\ngives the ranking of each city with respect to each important item.\r\nApplied to schools, this would work out as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XV\r\n\r\nTABLE OF RANKING-SCHOOLS ARRANGED ALPHABETICALLY\r\n\r\n=============================================================\r\n       |\r\nSCHOOL |               RANK IN\r\n-------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n       | Register | Defects  | Children | Children | Children\r\n       |          |  Found   | Needing  | Treated  |   not\r\n       |          |          | Treatment|          | Treated\r\n-------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n   A   |    10    |    11    |    11    |    12    |    6\r\n   B   |    20    |    22    |    22    |    24    |   12\r\n   C   |    30    |    33    |    30    |    36    |   18\r\n=======+==========+==========+==========+==========+=========\r\n\r\nSuch a table fails to convey its significance unless the reader is\r\nreminded that rank 18 in children not treated is as good a record for a\r\nschool that ranks 30 in register as is rank 6 for a school that ranks\r\n10 in register.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut report makes a serious mistake in failing to arrange\r\nschools according to population. If this were done, schools of a size\r\nwould be side by side and comparison would be fair. When, as in the\r\nabove table, schools are arranged alphabetically, a school with four\r\nthousand pupils may follow or precede a school with four hundred\r\npupils, and comparison will be unfair and futile.\r\n\r\nWhere, on the other hand, schools are arranged in order of register, a\r\ntable will show whether schools confronted with practically the same\r\nproblems, the same number of defects, the same number of children\r\nneeding treatment, are equally successful, or perhaps equally inactive,\r\nin correcting these defects. The following table brings out clearly\r\nmarked unequal achievement in the face of relatively equal need.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XVI\r\n\r\nTABLE OF RANKING-SCHOOLS ARRANGED ACCORDING TO REGISTER, NOT\r\nALPHABETICALLY\r\n\r\n=============================================================\r\n       |\r\n       |                       RANK IN\r\nSCHOOL +----------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n       | Register | Defects  | Children | Children | Children\r\n       |          |  Found   | Needing  | Treated  |   not\r\n       |          |          | Treatment|          | Treated\r\n-------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n   A   |     9    |     9    |     9    |     9    |    9\r\n   X   |    10    |    10    |    10    |    14    |    6\r\n   H   |    11    |    11    |    11    |    17    |    3\r\n=======+==========+==========+==========+==========+=========\r\n\r\nIf the number of schools in a state is so large that it is unlikely\r\nthat people will read the table of ranking because of the difficulty of\r\nfinding their own school, an alphabetical table might be given that\r\nwould show where to look in the general ranking table for the school or\r\nschools in which the reader is interested.\r\n\r\nExperience will demonstrate to public school superintendents the\r\nstrategic advantage of putting together all the things they need and of\r\ntelling the community over and over again just what needs there are,\r\nwhat penalties are paid for want of them, and what benefits would\r\nresult from obtaining them. If health needs of school children were\r\nplaced side by side with mental results, the relation would come out so\r\nclearly that parents, school boards, and taxpayers would realize how\r\ninextricably they are bound together and would see that health needs\r\nare satisfied. To this end superintendents should require teachers to\r\nkeep daily reports of school conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XVII\r\n\r\nWEEKLY CLASS-ROOM SCHEDULE\r\n\r\n===========+================+========================+==============\r\n          |    Temperature  |          Cleaning      |  Exercise\r\n          +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------------+------+-------\r\n          |     |     |     |     |     |            |  In  |Out of\r\n          |10.30|12.00| 2.00| Dry | Wet |Disinfecting| Room | Room\r\n----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------------+------+-------\r\nMonday    |     |     |     |     |     |            |      |\r\nTuesday   |     |     |     |     |     |            |      |\r\nWednesday |     |     |     |     |     |            |      |\r\nThursday  |     |     |     |     |     |            |      |\r\nFriday    |     |     |     |     |     |            |      |\r\n==========+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+============+======+=======\r\n\r\nThe teacher's daily report of the temperature of a schoolroom, taken\r\nthree times a day, tells the parent exactly what is the efficiency of\r\nthe ventilating and heating apparatus in the particular school in which\r\nhe is interested; whereas the report of the department of buildings\r\ngives only the number of schools which have an approved system of\r\nventilation and steam heat. School authorities may or may not know that\r\nthis system of ventilation is out of order, that the thermometer in the\r\nindoor playground of School A stood at forty degrees for many days in\r\nwinter. But they must know it when the principal of School A sends in a\r\ndaily record; the school board, the parents, or the press will then\r\nsee that the condition is remedied. If the condition is due to lack of\r\nfunds, funds will never be forthcoming so long as the condition is\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nSimilar results will follow publicity of overcrowding, too little play\r\nspace, dry cleaning of school buildings, etc. The intent of such\r\nreporting is not to \"keep tabs\" on the school-teacher, the school\r\nchild, the janitor, the principal, superintendent, or board, but to\r\ninsure favorable conditions and to correct bad conditions. This is done\r\nbest by giving everybody the facts. The objective test of the\r\nefficiency of a method throws emphasis on the method, not on the motive\r\nof those operating it. The blackboard method of publishing facts\r\nconcentrates attention upon the importance of those facts and enlists\r\naid in the attainment of the end sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president of Princeton University declares that for several decades\r\nwe have given education that does not instruct and instruction that\r\ndoes not educate. Others tell us that because we read daily papers and\r\nmagazines our minds become superficial, that our power to concentrate\r\nor memorize is weakened,--that we read so much of everything that we\r\nlearn little of anything. As the habit of reading magazines and\r\nnewspapers is constantly increasing, I think we must assume that it has\r\ncome to stay. If we cannot check it, we can at least turn it to good\r\nadvantage, systematize it, and discipline ourselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects continually described in newspapers and magazines,\r\nand even on billboards and in street-car advertising, is the subject of\r\nhygiene. No greater service can be rendered the community than for\r\nthose who are conducting discussions of health to teach people how to\r\nread correctly this mass of information regarding health, to separate\r\nmisinformation from information, and to apply the lessons learned to\r\npersonal and public hygiene. There is no better way of doing this than\r\nto teach a class or a child to clip out of magazines and newspapers all\r\nimportant references to health, and then to classify these under the\r\nsubject-matter treated. A teacher, parent, or club leader might\r\npractice by using the classification of subjects outlined in the\r\nContents of this book. It is surprising how rapidly one builds up a\r\nvaluable collection serviceable for talks or papers, but more\r\nparticularly for giving one a vital and intelligent interest in\r\npractical health topics.\r\n\r\nInterested in comparing the emphasis placed on health topics in a\r\nthree-cent paper having a small circulation with a penny paper having\r\ntwenty times the circulation, I made during one week thirty-eight\r\nclippings from the three-cent paper and ninety-five from the penny\r\npaper. The high-priced paper had no editorial comment within the field\r\nof health, whereas the penny paper had three columns, in which were\r\ndiscussed among other things: _The Economics of Bad Teeth_; _Need for\r\nIndividual Efficiency_; _\"Good Fellows\" Lower Standard of Living by\r\nNeglecting their Families_. The penny paper advertised fifty-two foods,\r\ngarments, whiskies, patent medicines, or beautifiers urged upon health\r\ngrounds. In the three-cent paper twenty-six out of thirty-eight items\r\nadvertised food, clothing, patent medicine, or whisky. One issue of a\r\nmonthly magazine devoted to woman's interests contained twenty-eight\r\narticles and editorials and fifty-five advertisements that concern\r\nhealth,--thirty-seven per cent of total reading matter and thirty-seven\r\nper cent of total advertisement.\r\n\r\nExcellent discipline is afforded by this clipping work. It is\r\nastonishing how few men and women, even from our better colleges, know\r\nhow to organize notes, clippings, or other data, so that they can be\r\nused a few weeks later. There is a satisfaction in seeing one's material\r\ngrow, as is remembered by all of us, in making picture scrapbooks or\r\ncollections of picture postal cards and stamps. \"Collections\" have\r\ngenerally failed for want of classification,--putting things of a kind\r\ntogether. Chronological arrangement is uninteresting because\r\nunprofitable. One never knows where to find a picture, or a stamp, or a\r\nhealth clipping. Clippings, like libraries, will be little used if not\r\nproperly catalogued so that use is easy. If a health-clipping collection\r\nis attempted, there are four essentials: (1) arrangement by topic; (2)\r\ninclusion of advertisements; (3) inclusion of items from magazines; (4)\r\ncross references.\r\n\r\nFor classification, envelopes can be used or manila cards 10x12 inches.\r\nThe teacher, parent, or advanced student will probably think the\r\nenvelope most useful because most easily carried and filed,--most\r\nlikely to be used. But clippings should be bound together in orderly\r\nappearance, or else it will be disagreeable working with them.\r\nChildren, however, will like the pasting on sheets, which show clearly\r\nthe growth of each topic. Envelopes or cards should not have clippings\r\nthat deal with only one health topic. Unless a test is made to see how\r\nmany health references there are in a given period, it should be made a\r\nrule not to clip any item that does not contain something new,--some\r\naddition to the knowledge already collected.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements will prove interesting and educative. When newspapers\r\nand magazines announce some new truth, the commercial motive of\r\nmanufacturer or dealer sees profit in telling over and over again how\r\ncertain goods will meet the new need. Children will soon notice that\r\nthe worst advertisements appear in the papers that talk most of\r\n\"popular rights,\" \"justice,\" and \"morality.\" They will be shocked to\r\nsee that the popular papers accept money to tell falsehoods about fake\r\ncures. They will be pleased that the best monthly magazines contain no\r\nsuch advertisements. They will challenge paper or magazine, and thus\r\nwill be enlisted while young in the fight against health advertisements\r\nthat injure health.\r\n\r\nTo clip articles from magazines will seem almost irreverent at first.\r\nBut the reverence for magazines and books is less valuable to education\r\nthan the knowledge concealed in them. Except where families preserve\r\nall magazines, clippings will add greatly to their serviceability.\r\n\r\nThe art of cross-referencing is invaluable to the organized mind. The\r\npurpose of classifying one's information is not to show how much there\r\nis, but to answer questions quickly and to guide constructive thinking.\r\nA clipping that deals with _alcoholism_, _patent medicine_, and\r\n_tuberculosis_ must be posted in three places, or cross-referenced;\r\notherwise it will be used to answer but one question when it might\r\nanswer three. If magazines may not be cut, it will be easy to record\r\nthe fact of a useful article by writing the title, page, and date on\r\nthe appropriate index card, or inclosing a slip so marked in the proper\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the most important bibliography one can have in\r\nhis private library is a classification of the material of which he\r\nhimself has become a part while reading it, there are a number of\r\nhealth journals that one can profitably subscribe for. In fact, it is\r\noften true that the significant discoveries in scientific fields, or\r\nthe latest public improvements, such as parks, bridges, model\r\ntenements, will not be appreciated until one has read in health\r\njournals how these improvements affect the sickness rate and the\r\nenjoyment rate of those least able to control their living conditions.\r\nThe physician and nurse in their educational work for hospitals are\r\ndistributors of health propaganda.\r\n\r\nWherever there is a local journal devoted to health, parents, teachers,\r\neducators, and club leaders would do well to subscribe and to hold this\r\njournal up to a high standard by quoting, thanking, criticising it. In\r\nNew Jersey, for example, is a monthly called the _New Jersey Review of\r\nCharities and Corrections_ that deals with every manner of subject\r\nhaving to do with public health as well as with private and public\r\nmorality and education.\r\n\r\nA similar journal, intended for national instruction, is _The Survey_,\r\nwhose topical index for last year enumerates two hundred and thirty-two\r\narticles dealing with subjects directly connected with public hygiene,\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n  Schools, 6; school inspection, 3; eyes,--school children, 1; sex\r\n  instruction in the schools, 2; psychiatric clinic, special\r\n  children, 2; industrial education, 5; child labor, 18;\r\n  playgrounds, 26; alley, crap, playing in streets, 3; labor\r\n  conditions, 18; industrial accidents, 10; wage-earner's\r\n  insurance, 4; factory inspection, 1; consumer's league, 3; women's\r\n  work, 6; tuberculosis, 23; hospitals, dispensaries (social), 5;\r\n  tenement reform, 10; living conditions, 2; baths, 1; public\r\n  comfort stations, 2; lodging houses, 1; clean streets, 6; clean\r\n  milk, 6; smoke, 1; noises, 1; parks, 1; patent medicines, 2;\r\n  sanitary code, 1; mortality statistics, 2; social settlements and\r\n  public health, 1; midwives, 1; children's bureau, 1; juvenile and\r\n  adult delinquent, 25; dependent, defective, and insane, 7; blind,\r\n  5; cripples, 1; homes for aged, 1; inebriates, 3; Traveler's Aid\r\n  Committee, 1; infant mortality, 2; social diseases, 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The National Hospital Record_, the _Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette_,\r\nthe _Journal of Nursing_, are three other magazines primarily intended\r\nfor nurses and physicians, but full of suggestive material for\r\nunprofessional readers. National magazines concerned with health, but\r\nseeking popular circulation, are _Good Health_ and _Physical Culture_.\r\nIn England there is a special magazine called _Children's Diseases_,\r\nwhich could be of great help to a school library for special reference.\r\nThe same can be said of the _Psychological Clinic_, _Pediatrics_, and\r\nother technical journals published in this country. For many persons,\r\nto make the best use of any one copy of these magazines, clipping is of\r\ncourse impossible, but noting on a card or envelope is practicable.\r\n\r\nOf late many of the national popular magazines have several columns\r\ndevoted to health. We have not appreciated the educational\r\npossibilities of these columns. In most large cities there are monthly\r\nbook reviews which may be profitably consulted in learning the new\r\nthought in the health field. If teachers would either write their\r\nexperience or ask questions, if children knew that in a certain\r\nmagazine or newspaper questions as to ventilation, bathing, exercise,\r\nwould be answered, they would take a keen interest in the progress of\r\ndiscussions. The large daily papers make a great feature of their\r\nhealth hints. It is not their fault if questioners care more about\r\ncosmetics and hair bleaches than about the fresh-air cure of headaches.\r\nThey will cooeperate with teachers and parents in securing more general\r\ndiscussion of other problems than beauty doctoring.\r\n\r\nFinally, persons wanting not only to have intelligence as to matters\r\npromoting health, but actually to exert a helpful influence in their\r\ncommunity, ought to want the published reports of the mayor, health\r\ndepartment, the public schools, and other institutions, noting\r\ncarefully all that is said about conditions relating to health and\r\nabout efforts made to correct all unfavorable conditions. The best\r\nliterature of our day, with regard to social needs, appears in the\r\nreports of our public and private institutions and societies. Of\r\nincreasing value are the publications of the national government\r\nprinting office. Because it is no one's business to find out what\r\nvaluable material is contained in such reports, and because no\r\neducational museum is comparing report with report, those who live\r\nnearest to our health problems and who see most clearly the health\r\nremedies, are not stimulated to give to the public their special\r\nknowledge in an interesting, convincing way.\r\n\r\nTeaching children how to find health lessons in public documents will\r\nadvance the cause of public ethics as well as of public health. At the\r\nNew York State Conference of Charities, of 1907, one official\r\ncomplained that the physicians made no educational use of their\r\nvaluable experience for public education. He stated that a study of\r\nmedical journals and health articles in popular magazines revealed the\r\nfact that the number of papers prepared by physicians in state\r\nhospitals averaged one to a doctor for every five or six years of\r\nservice. This state of affairs is even more exaggerated in strictly\r\neducational institutions. Columbia University has recently instituted a\r\nseries of lectures to be given by its professors to its professors, so\r\nthat they may have a general knowledge of the work being done in other\r\nfields besides their own at their own university. This is equally\r\nimportant for teachers and heads of departments in elementary schools.\r\nIt is now admitted by most educators that elementary schools and young\r\nchildren present more pedagogical difficulties and pressing biological\r\nproblems than higher schools. If teachers and parents would realize\r\nthat their method of solving the health problems that arise daily in\r\nthe schoolroom and in the home would interest other mothers and\r\nteachers, their spirit of cooeperation would soon be reflected in school\r\njournals, popular magazines, and daily newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.

Work of itself never killed anybody nor made\r\nanybody sick. Work has caused worry, mental strain, and physical\r\nbreakdown, only when men while working have been deprived of air, sun,\r\nlight, exercise, sleep, proper food at the proper time, opportunity to\r\nlive and work hygienically. Fortunately for human progress, doing\r\nnothing brings ailments of its own and has none of the compensations of\r\nwork. As the stomach deprived of substantial food craves unnatural\r\nfood,--sweets, stimulants,--so the mind deprived of substantial,\r\nregular diet of wholesome work turns to unwholesome, petty, fantastic,\r\nsuspicious, unhappy thoughts. This state of mind, combined with the\r\nlack of bodily exercise that generally accompanies it, reacts\r\nunfavorably on physical health. An editor has aptly termed the\r\ndo-nothing condition as a self-inflicted confinement:\r\n\r\n  A great deal of the misery and wretchedness among young men that\r\n  inherit great fortunes is caused by the fact that they are\r\n  practically in jail. They have nothing to do but eat, drink, and\r\n  enjoy themselves, and they cannot understand why their lives are\r\n  dull.\r\n\r\n  We have had the owner of a great railroad system pathetically\r\n  telling the public that he is unhappy. That is undoubtedly true,\r\n  because with all his race horses, and his yachts, and all the\r\n  things that he imagines to be pleasures, he is not really doing\r\n  anything.\r\n\r\n  If he were running one little railroad station up the road,\r\n  handling the freight, fussing about dispatches, living above the\r\n  railroad station in two rooms, and buying shoes in a neighboring\r\n  village for fifteen children he would be busy and happy.\r\n\r\n  But he cannot be happy because he is in prison,--in a prison of\r\n  money, a prison that is honorable because it gives him everything\r\n  that he wants, and he wants nothing.\r\n\r\nA New York newspaper that circulates among the working classes where\r\nyoung men and women are inclined to associate health and happiness with\r\ndoing nothing recently gave two columns to \"Dandy Jim,\" the richest dog\r\nin the world. Dandy Jim's mistress left him a ten-thousand-dollar\r\nlegacy. During his lifetime he wore diamonds. Every day he ate candy\r\nthat cost eighty cents a pound. The coachman took him driving in the\r\npark sunny afternoons. He had no cares and nothing to work for. His\r\nfood came without effort. He had fatty degeneration of the vital\r\norgans. He was pampered, coddled, and killed thereby. Thousands of men\r\nand women drag out lives of unhappiness for themselves and others\r\nbecause, like Dandy Jim, they have nothing to work for, are pampered,\r\ncoddled victims of fatty degeneration. When President Butler of\r\nColumbia University finds it necessary to censure \"the folly and\r\nindifference of the fathers, vanity and thoughtless pride of the\r\nmothers\" who encourage do-nothing ailments; and when the editor of the\r\n_Psychological Clinic_ protests that the fashionable private schools\r\nand the private tutor share with rich fathers and mothers\r\nresponsibility for life failures,--it is time that educators teach\r\nchildren themselves the physical and moral ailments and disillusions\r\nthat come from doing nothing.\r\n\r\nTen years ago a stenographer inherited two hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars. Her dream of nothing to do was realized. She gave up her\r\nstrenuous business life. Possessions formerly coveted soon clogged her\r\npowers of enjoyment. She imagined herself suffering from various\r\ndiseases, shut herself up in her house, and refused to see any one. She\r\ngrew morbid and was sure that every person who approached her had some\r\nsneaking, personal, hostile motive. Though always busy, she\r\naccomplished little. Desultory work, procrastination, and\r\nself-indulgence destroyed her power of concentration. She could not\r\nthink long enough on one subject to think it out straight, therefore\r\nshe was constantly deceived in her friends and interests. She first\r\ntrusted everybody, then mistrusted everybody. Infatuation with every\r\nnew acquaintance was quickly followed by suspicion. For years she was a\r\nvery sick woman, a victim of do-nothing ailments.\r\n\r\nDoing nothing has of late been seriously recommended to American\r\nbusiness men. They are advised to retire from active work as soon as\r\ntheir savings produce reasonable income. It is true, this suggestion\r\nhas been made as an antidote to greed rather than for the happiness of\r\nthe business man. What retiring from business is apt to mean, is\r\nindicated by a gentleman who at the age of sixty decided to sell his\r\nseat on the New York Stock Exchange and to enjoy life. He became\r\nrestless and very miserable. He threw himself violently into one thing\r\nafter another; in less than a year he became an ill, broken old man,\r\nafter trying vainly to buy back his business.\r\n\r\nBoth mind and body were made to work. The function of the brain is to\r\nthink to a purpose, just as the function of the heart is to pump blood.\r\nThe habit of doing nothing is very easily formed. The \"out-of-work\"\r\nsoon become \"the work-shy.\" Having too little to do is worse for the\r\nbody and mind than having too little to eat. Social reformers emphasize\r\nthe bad effect on society of vagrancy. Evils of indiscriminate relief\r\nto the poor are vividly described year after year. The philanthropist\r\nis condemned, who, by his gifts, encourages an employee's family to\r\nspend what they do not earn, and to shun work. Yet the idleness of the\r\ntramp, street loafer, and professional mendicant is a negligible evil\r\ncompared with the hindrance to human progress caused by the idleness of\r\nthe well-to-do, the rich, the educated, the refined, the \"best\" people.\r\nIt is as much a wrong to bring up children in an atmosphere of\r\ndo-nothingism, as to refuse to have their teeth attended to or to have\r\nglasses fitted to weak eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of community welfare it is far more serious for\r\nthe rich child to be brought up in idleness or without a purpose than\r\nfor the poor child to become a public charge. Not only has society a\r\nright to expect more from rich children in return for the greater\r\nbenefits they enjoy, but so long as rich children control the\r\nexpenditure of money, they control also the health and happiness of\r\nother human beings. Unless taught the value and joy of wholesome work\r\nthey cannot themselves think straight, nor are they likely to want to\r\nunderstand how they can use their wealth for the benefit of mankind. To\r\nquote President Butler again:\r\n\r\n  The rich boy who receives a good education and is trained to be a\r\n  self-respecting member of the body politic might in time share on\r\n  equal terms the chance of the poor boy to become a man of genuine\r\n  influence and importance on his own account, just as now by the\r\n  neglect, or worse, of his parents the very rich boy is apt to be\r\n  relegated to the limbo of curiosities, and too often of decadence.\r\n\r\nNervous invalids make life miserable for themselves and for others,\r\nwhen often their sole malady is lack of the right kind of work to do.\r\n\r\nSuiting work to interest and interest to work is an economy that should\r\nnot be overlooked. The energy spent in forcing oneself to do a\r\ndistasteful task can be turned to productive channels when work is made\r\npleasurable. The fact is frequently deplored that whereas formerly a\r\nman became a full-fledged craftsman, able to perform any branch of his\r\ntrade, he is now confined to doing special acts because neither his\r\ninterest nor his mind is called into play. Work seems to react\r\nunfavorably on his health. He has not the pride of the artisan in the\r\nfinished product, for he seldom sees it. He does a task. His employer\r\nis a taskmaster. He decides that work is not good for him as easily as\r\nwhen a school-boy he grasped the meaning of escape from his lessons. By\r\nfailing to fit studies to a student's interest, or by failing to insure\r\na student's interest in his studies, schools and colleges miseducate\r\nyoung men and young women to look upon all work as tasks, as\r\ndiscipline, necessary but irksome, and to be avoided if possible. Just\r\nas there is a way of turning all the energy of the play instinct into\r\nschool work, so there is a way of interesting the factory and office\r\nworker in his job. However mechanical work may be, there is always the\r\ninterest in becoming the most efficient worker in a room or a trade.\r\nRoutine--accurate and detailed work--does not mean the stultification\r\nof the imagination. It takes more imagination to see the interesting\r\nthings in statistical or record work than to write a novel. Therefore\r\nemployers should make it a point to help their employees to realize the\r\nsignificance of the perfection of each detail and the importance of\r\neach man's part. The other day a father said to me, \"I want my boys to\r\nbe as ashamed to do work in which they are not interested as to accept\r\ngraft.\" When interest in work and efficiency in work are regarded as of\r\nmore importance than the immediate returns for work, when it is as\r\nnatural for boys and girls to demand enjoyment and complete living in\r\nwork as it is to thrill at the sight of the Stars and Stripes,\r\ndo-nothing ailments will be less frequent and less costly.\r\n\r\nWork--that one enjoys--is an invaluable unpatented medicine. It can\r\nmake the sick well and keep the well from getting sick. It is the chief\r\nreliance of mental hygiene. \"I should have the grippe if I had time,\"\r\nsaid a business woman to me the other day; but she did not have time,\r\nhence she did not have the grippe.\r\n\r\n    If you're sick with something chronic,\r\n    And you think you need a tonic,\r\n            Do something.\r\n    There is life and health in doing,\r\n    There is pleasure in pursuing;\r\n    Doing, then, is health accruing--\r\n            Do something.\r\n\r\n    And if you're seeking pleasure,\r\n    Or enjoyment in full measure,\r\n            Do something.\r\n    Idleness, there's nothing in it;\r\n    'Twill not pay you for a minute--\r\n            Do something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nHEREDITY BUGABOOS AND HEREDITY TRUTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the red-letter days of my life was that on which I learned that\r\nI could not have inherited tuberculosis from two uncles who died of\r\nconsumption. For years I had known that I was a marked victim. Silently\r\nI carried my tragedy, suspecting each cold and headache to be the\r\ntelltale messenger that should let others into my secret. He was a\r\nveritable emancipator who informed me that heredity did not work from\r\nuncle to nephew; that not more than a predisposition to consumption\r\ncould pass even from parent to child; that a predisposition to\r\nconsumption would come to nothing without the germ of the disease and\r\nthe environmental conditions which favor its development; and that if\r\nthose so predisposed avoid gross infection, lead a healthy life, and\r\nbreathe fresh air they are as safe as though no tuberculous lungs had\r\never existed in the world. Some years later I learned to understand the\r\nother side of the case; I realized how I had been in real danger of\r\ncontracting consumption in the darkened, ill-ventilated sick room of\r\nthe uncle who taught me my letters and gave me my ideal of God's\r\npurpose in sending uncles to small boys.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct things which make each individual life: the\r\nliving stuff, the physical basis of life, handed down from parent to\r\nchild; and the environmental conditions which surround it and play upon\r\nit and rouse its reactions and its latent possibilities. It is like the\r\nseed and the cultivation. You cannot grow corn from wheat, but you can\r\ngrow the best wheat, or you may let your crop fail through careless\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\nIt is well that we should think seriously about the part played by\r\nheredity, for the living stuff of the future depends upon our sense of\r\nresponsibility in this regard. The intelligent citizen would do well to\r\nread such a book as J. Arthur Thompson's _Heredity_ (1908), in which\r\nthe latest conclusions of science are clearly and soundly set forth.\r\n\r\nThe main problem of to-day, however, is to use well the talents that we\r\nhave. Here two things should always be kept in mind: First, the\r\ninherited elements which make up our minds and bodies are complex and\r\ndiverse. Health and strength are inherited as well as disease and\r\nweakness; they have indeed a better chance of survival. In the most\r\nunpromising ancestry there are latent potentialities which may be made\r\nfruitful by effort. No limit whatever can be set to the possibilities\r\nof improvement in any individual.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if science has shown anything more clearly than\r\nthe importance of heredity, it is the importance of environment. This\r\ninfluence upon human lives is within our control, and it is a grave\r\nerror to neglect what lies clearly within our power and to bemoan what\r\ndoes not. Science has wrought no benefits greater than those which\r\nresult from drawing a clear line between heredity bugaboos and heredity\r\ntruths. An overemphasis on the hereditary factor in development at the\r\nexpense of the environmental factor, I call a heredity bugaboo; and it\r\nis a tendency which cannot be too strongly condemned. To fight against\r\nthe sins and penalties of one's grandfather is a forlorn task that\r\nquickly discourages. To overcome diseases of environment, of shop and\r\nstreet, of house and school, seems, on the contrary, an easy task.\r\nHeredity bugaboos dishearten, enervate, encourage excesses and neglect.\r\nHeredity truths stimulate remedial and preventive measures.\r\n\r\nWe may well watch with interest the progress of eugenics, that new\r\nscience which biologists and sociologists hope will some day remake the\r\nvery living stuff of the human race. But meanwhile let us take up with\r\nhope and courage and enthusiasm the great hemisphere of human fate\r\nwhich lies within our grasp. Good food and fresh air, well-built\r\ncities, enlightened schools and well-ordered industries, stable and\r\nfree and expert government,--given these things, we can transform the\r\nworld with the means now at our disposal. We can reap, if we will,\r\nsplendid possibilities now going to waste, and by intelligent\r\nbiological and sociological engineering we can hand on to the next\r\ngeneration an environmental inheritance which will make their task far\r\neasier than ours.\r\n\r\n\"Physical deterioration\" is a bugaboo that is discovered by some in\r\nheredity and by others in modern industrial evils. The British director\r\ngeneral called attention a few years ago to the fact that from forty to\r\nsixty per cent of the men who were being examined for military service\r\nwere physically unfit. A Commission on Physical Deterioration was\r\nappointed to investigate the cause, and to learn whether the low\r\nphysical standard of the would-be Tommy Atkins was due to inherited\r\ndefects. The results of this study were published in a large volume\r\ncalled _Report on Physical Deterioration, 1904_, in which is set forth\r\na positive programme for obtaining periodically facts as to the\r\nphysique of the nation. In the course of the commission's exhaustive\r\ninvestigation there was found no evidence that any progressive\r\ndeterioration was going on in any function of the body except the\r\nteeth. \"There are happily no grounds for associating dental degeneracy\r\nwith progressive physical deterioration.\" The increase in optical\r\ndefects is attributed not to the deterioration of the eye, but to\r\ngreater knowledge, more treatment, and better understanding of the\r\nconnection between optical defects and headache.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Testing Environment--House Score]\r\n\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |           DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN HOUSE SCORE CARD            |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | LIGHT--Light enough to read easily in every part.                  |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | GLOOMY--Not light enough to read easily in every part, but enough  |\r\n | readily to see one's way about when doors are closed.              |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | DARK--Too dark to see one's way about easily when doors are        |\r\n | closed.                                                            |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | WELL VENTILATED--With window on street or fair-sized yard (not     |\r\n | less than 12 ft. deep for a five-story tenement house not on a     |\r\n | corner), or on a \"large,\" \"well-ventilated\" court open to the sky  |\r\n | at the top: \"large\" being for a court entirely open on one side to |\r\n | the street or yard in a five-story tenement, not less than 6 ft.   |\r\n | wide from the wall of the building to the lot line; for a court    |\r\n | inclosed on three sides and the other on the lot line in a         |\r\n | five-story tenement, not less than 12x24 ft., \"well ventilated\"    |\r\n | meaning either entirely open on one side to the street or yard, or |\r\n | else having a tunnel at the bottom connecting with the street or   |\r\n | yard.                                                              |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | FAIRLY VENTILATED--With window opening on a shallow yard or on a   |\r\n | narrow court, open to the sky at the top, or else with 5x3 inside  |\r\n | window (15 ft. square) opening on a well-ventilated room in same   |\r\n | apartment.                                                         |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | BADLY VENTILATED--With no window on the street, or on a yard, or   |\r\n | on a court open to the sky, and with no window, or a very small    |\r\n | window, opening on an adjoining room.                              |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | IN GOOD REPAIR--No torn wall paper, broken plaster, broken         |\r\n | woodwork or flooring, nor badly shrunk or warped floor boards or   |\r\n | wainscoting, leaving large cracks.                                 |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | IN FAIR REPAIR--Slightly torn or loose wall paper, slightly broken |\r\n | plaster, warped floor boards and wainscoting.                      |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | IN BAD REPAIR--Very badly torn wall paper or broken plaster over a |\r\n | considerable area, or badly broken woodwork or flooring.           |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | (Rooms not exactly coinciding with any of the three classes are to |\r\n | be included in the one the description of which comes nearest to   |\r\n | the condition.)                                                    |\r\n |                                                                    |\r\n | SINKS: GOOD--Iron, on iron supports with iron back above to        |\r\n | prevent splashing of water on wall surface, in light location,     |\r\n | used for one family.

Every nation, every state,\r\nand every city should enlist all its educational and scientific forces\r\nto ascertain in what respects social efficiency is endangered by\r\nphysical deficiencies that can be avoided only by restricting\r\nparenthood, and the environmental deficiencies that can be avoided by\r\nefficient health machinery.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all heredity truths are these: (1) the deficiencies of\r\ninfants are infinitesimal compared with the deficiencies of the world\r\nwith which we surround them; (2) each of us can have a part in\r\nbegetting for posterity an environment of health and of opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nINEFFECTIVE AND EFFECTIVE WAYS OF COMBATING ALCOHOLISM\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever the Stars and Stripes fly over school buildings it is made\r\ncompulsory to teach the evils of alcoholism. For nearly a generation\r\nthe great majority of school children of the United States have been\r\ntaught that alcohol, in however small quantities, is a poison and a\r\nmenace to personal and national health and prosperity. Yet during this\r\nvery period the per capita consumption of every kind of alcoholic\r\nbeverage has increased. Whereas 16.49 gallons of spirituous liquors\r\nwere consumed per capita of population in 1896, 22.27 gallons were used\r\nin 1906. Obviously the results of methods hitherto in vogue for\r\ncombating alcoholism are disappointing.\r\n\r\nWhy this paradoxical relation of precept to practice? Why is this, the\r\nmost hygiene-instructed country in the world, the Elysium of the\r\npatent-medicine and cocaine traffic? If we have only the expected\r\ndivergence of achievement from ideal, then there is nothing for us to\r\ndo but to congratulate ourselves and posterity upon the part played by\r\ncompulsory legislation in committing all states and territories to\r\nhygiene instruction in all public schools. If, on the other hand, our\r\ndisappointment is due to ineffective method, then the next step is to\r\nchange our method.\r\n\r\nThe chief purpose of school hygiene has hitherto been not to promote\r\npersonal and community health, but to lessen the use of alcohol and\r\ntobacco. Arguments were required against whisky, beer, cigars, and\r\ncigarettes. As the strongest arguments would probably make the most\r\nlasting impression upon the school child and the best profits for\r\nauthor and bookseller, writers vied with one another in the rhetoric\r\nand hyperbole of platform agitation. What effect would it have upon you\r\nif you were exhorted frequently during the next eight years to avoid\r\ntobacco because a mother once killed a child by washing its head in\r\ntobacco water? What is the effect on the mind of a boy or a girl who\r\nsees that the family doctor, the minister, the teacher, the judge, the\r\ngovernor, the President, and the philanthropist use tobacco and\r\nalcoholic beverages, when taught that \"boys who use tobacco and\r\nalcoholic beverages will find closed in their faces the doors to\r\nstrength, good health, skill in athletics, good scholarship, long life,\r\nbest companions, many business positions, highest success\"? It is\r\nprobably true that \"a boy once drank some whisky from a flask and died\r\nwithin a few hours.\" But that story is about as typical of boys and of\r\nwhisky as that a boy once drank whisky from a flask and did not die for\r\nninety years afterwards, or that George Washington drank whisky and\r\nbecame the Father of his Country.\r\n\r\nHow special pleading has dominated the teaching of school hygiene is\r\nillustrated by a recent book which, for the most part, successfully\r\nbreaks away from the narrow point of view and the crude methods\r\nhitherto prevailing. It presents the following facts concerning New\r\nYork City:\r\n\r\n Saloons                                                 10,821\r\n Arrests                                                133,749\r\n Expense of police department                       $10,199,206\r\n Police courts, jails, workhouses, reformatories      1,310,411\r\n Hospitals, asylums, and other charities              4,754,380\r\n\r\nIt is fair to the author to state that she does not declare in so many\r\nwords that the shutting up of the saloons would obviate all the arrests\r\nand all the hospital, jail, and charity bills. Instead of _wipe out_\r\nshe says _shrivel_. No truth would have been lost by avoiding all\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe author probably felt as I did when I took my total abstainer's\r\nprotest to a celebrated scientist who had exposed certain misstatements\r\nregarding the effect of small quantities of alcohol: \"Is not the\r\nuntruth of these exaggerated statements less dangerous than the untruth\r\nof dispassionate, scientific statement? So long as the child mind takes\r\nin only an impression, is it not better to write this impression\r\nindelibly?\" He sadly but indulgently replied, \"And in what other\r\nstudies would you substitute exaggeration for truth?\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction has already begun against exaggeration in hygiene\r\ntext-books, against drawing lessons from accidental or exceptional\r\ncases of excessive use of alcohol, against classing moderate drinking\r\nand smoking with drunkenness as sins of equal magnitude, and against\r\noverlooking grave social and industrial evils that threaten children\r\nfar earlier and more frequently than do tobacco and alcohol. Instead of\r\nadding an ell to the truth, text-book writers are now adding only an\r\ninch or two at a time. No longer do we favor highly colored charts that\r\npicture in purple, green, and black the effect of stimulants and\r\nnarcotics upon the heart and brain, the stomach, the liver, the knee,\r\nand the eardrum, _assuming that all resultant evils are concentrated in\r\none organ_. Menacing habits, such as overeating and indulgence in\r\nself-pity, are beginning to receive attention. It is also true that\r\nphysiology and anatomy are progressively made more interesting.\r\nPublishers are looking for the utmost originality compatible with the\r\npurpose of the present laws and with the only effective public\r\nsentiment that has hitherto been interested in the interpretation of\r\nthose laws.\r\n\r\nA score of improvements in the method of carrying out a small ideal\r\nwill not take the place of enlarging that ideal. If existing laws stand\r\nin the way of broadening the purpose of school hygiene, let the laws be\r\nchanged. If text-book publishers stand in the way, let us induce or\r\ncompel them to get out of the way. If we fear rumsellers, their money,\r\nand the insidious political methods that they might employ to bring in\r\nundertruth if overtruth is once sacrificed, let us go to our\r\ncommunities and locate the rumseller's guns, draw their fire, tell the\r\ntruth about their opposition, and educate the public to overcome it.\r\nIf, on the other hand, misguided teetotalism stands in the way, then,\r\nas one teetotaler, I suggest that we prove, as we can, in our\r\nrespective communities that there is a better way of inculcating habits\r\nof temperance and self-restraint than by telling untruths, overtruths,\r\nor half truths about alcohol and tobacco. Let us prove, as we can, that\r\na subject vital to every individual, to every industry, and to every\r\ngovernment is now prevented from fulfilling its mission not by its\r\nenemies but by its friends. We can learn the character of hygiene\r\ninstruction in our schools and the interest taken in it by teachers,\r\nprincipals, and superintendents. We can learn how teachers practice\r\nhygiene at school, and how the children of our communities are affected\r\nby the hygiene instruction now given. Finally, we can compel a public\r\ndiscussion of the facts, and action in accordance with facts. Without\r\nquestioning anybody's avowed motive, we can learn how big that motive\r\nis and how adequate or inadequate is the method of executing it.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and tobacco really occupy but a very small share of the\r\ninterest and attention of even those men and women by whom they are\r\nhabitually used. Hygiene, on the other hand, is of constant,\r\nuninterrupted concern. Why, therefore, should it be planned to have\r\nalcohol and tobacco displace the broader subject of personal and public\r\nhygiene in the attention and interest of children throughout the school\r\nlife? Beyond the text-book and schoolroom a thousand influences are at\r\nwork to teach the social evils, the waste of energy, and the\r\nunhappiness that always accompany the excessive use--and frequently\r\nresult from a moderate use--of stimulants and narcotics. Of the many\r\nreasons for not drinking and smoking, physiology gives those that\r\nleast interest and impress the child. The secondary effects, rather\r\nthan the immediate effects, are those that determine a child's action.\r\nMost of the direct physiological effects are, in the majority of\r\ninstances, less serious in themselves than the effects of overeating,\r\nof combining milk with acids, of eating irregularly, of neglecting\r\nconstipation. Were it not for the social and industrial consequences of\r\ndrunkenness and nicotinism, it is doubtful if the most lurid picture of\r\nfatty degeneration, alcoholic consumption, hardened liver, inactive\r\nstomach lining, would outweigh the pleasing--and deceiving--sensations\r\nof alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe strong appeal to the child or man is the effect these habits have\r\nupon his mother, his employer, his wife, his children. The vast\r\nmajority of us will avoid or stop using anything that makes us\r\noffensive to those with whom we are most intimately associated, and to\r\nthose upon whom our professional and industrial promotion depends.\r\nChildren will profit from drill in and out of school in the science of\r\navoiding offense and of giving happiness, but unless the\r\ncategories--_acts that give offense_ and _acts that give\r\nhappiness_--are wide enough to include the main acts committed in the\r\nnormal relations of son, companion, employer, husband, father, and\r\ncitizen, those who set out to avoid alcohol and tobacco find themselves\r\nill equipped to carry the obligations of a temperate, law-abiding\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThings do not happen as described in the early text-book. Other things\r\nnot mentioned hinder progress and happiness. The child at work resents\r\nthe mis-education received at school and suspects that he has been\r\nfollowing false gods. The enemies that cause him trouble come from\r\nunexpected sources. He finds it infinitely easier to eschew alcohol and\r\ntobacco than to avoid living conditions that insidiously undermine his\r\naversion to stimulants and narcotics. The reasons for avoiding\r\nstimulants in the interest of others are more numerous and more cogent\r\nthan the reasons for avoiding stimulants and narcotics for one's own\r\nsake. The altruistic reasons for shunning stimulants and narcotics\r\ncannot be implanted in the child unless he sees the evil of excess _per\r\nse_ in anything and everything, and unless he becomes thoroughly\r\ngrounded in the life relations and health relations to which he must\r\nadapt himself.\r\n\r\nUnclean streets, unclean milk, congested tenements, can do more harm\r\nthan alcohol and tobacco, because they breed a physique that craves\r\nstimulants and drugs. Adenoids and defective vision will injure a\r\nlarger proportion of the afflicted than will alcohol and tobacco,\r\nbecause they earlier and more certainly substitute discouragement for\r\nhope, handicap for equal chance. Failure to enforce health laws is a\r\nmore serious menace to health and morals than drunkenness or tobacco\r\ncancer.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that we must attack the problem of alcohol from the\r\nstandpoint of its social and industrial effects, we are forced at once\r\nto consider the machinery by which cities and governments control the\r\nmanufacture and sale of alcohol. It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\ncourses in regulating the traffic in alcohol are more necessary than\r\ncourses in the effects of alcohol upon digestion and respiration.\r\n\r\nIf Sunday closing of saloons, local option, high license, and\r\nprohibition have failed, there is no evidence that the failure is due\r\nto the principles underlying any one of these methods. Until more\r\nearnest effort is made to study the effects of these methods, the\r\nresults of their enforcement and the causes of their nonenforcement, no\r\none is justified in declaring that either policy is successful or\r\nunsuccessful. It is very easy to select from the meager facts now\r\navailable convincing proofs both that prohibition does not prohibit and\r\nthat high license leads to increased drunkenness. The consequence is\r\nthat the movements to control, restrict, or prohibit the use of alcohol\r\nare emotional, not rational.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to keep emotion, sensation, sentiment, at white heat.\r\nMost extremists worship legislation and do not try to keep interest\r\nalive by telling every week or every month new facts about the week or\r\nthe month before. No new fuel is added to the anti-saloon fire, which\r\ngradually cools and dies down. Not so, however, with those who make\r\nmoney by the sale of intoxicants. The greater the opposition, the more\r\nbrains, the more effort, the more money they put into overcoming or\r\ncircumventing that opposition. Fuel is piled on and the bonfire is fed\r\nfreely. Every day the anti-restriction bonfire becomes larger and\r\nlarger, and the anti-saloon bonfire becomes smaller and smaller. By\r\ncarefully selecting their facts, by counting the number of arrests for\r\ndrunkenness and the number of saloons open on Sunday, by reiteration of\r\ntheir story the pro-saloonists gradually win recruits from the\r\nopposition, and, when the next election comes, their friends outnumber\r\ntheir enemies and the \"dry\" policy of a city, county, or state is\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nThe failures attributed to prohibitive or restrictive measures are\r\nprobably no more numerous than the failures of government in other\r\nrespects. The present ambassador from England, James Bryce, writing his\r\n_American Commonwealth_, declared that municipal government was\r\nAmerica's \"most conspicuous failure.\" The mayor of Toledo, writing in\r\n1907, says, \"There has been a pessimism, almost enthusiastic, about the\r\ncity.\" These failures are due not to any lack of desire for good\r\ngovernment, not to any fundamental evils of cities, but to the fact\r\nthat municipal reform, like the crusade against alcohol, has been based\r\nupon emotionalism, not upon definite proof. Reformers have been unable\r\nto lead in the right direction, because they have looked at their\r\nlantern instead of their road. Not having cumulative information as to\r\ngovernment acts, they have been unable to keep their fires burning. To\r\nillustrate: in November, 1907, the governor of New York state, the\r\nmayor of New York City, and reformers of national reputation eulogized\r\nthe tenement-house department; yet this department, whose founding was\r\nregarded as a national benefaction, was the only department of the city\r\ngovernment that did not receive an increase for 1908. It is in the\r\nposition of temperance legislation, the facts of whose enforcement or\r\nnonenforcement are not promptly and continuously made public.\r\n\r\nFear of the negro victim of alcoholism, social evils of intemperance,\r\nwhether among white or black, industrial uncertainty and waste due to\r\nalcoholism, are the three chief motives that have swept alcohol traffic\r\nout of the greater part of the South. Knowledge of physiological evils\r\nhas had little influence, except as it may have rendered more\r\nacceptable the claim that alcoholism is a disease against which there\r\nis no insurance except abolition of alcohol as a beverage. Religious\r\nrevivals, street parades by day and by night, illustrated banners,\r\npersonal intercession, lines of women and children at the polls, made\r\nit necessary for voters to make known their intention, and made it\r\nextremely difficult for respectable men, engaged in respectable\r\nbusiness, to vote for saloons. Some states have gone so far as to\r\nprohibit the manufacture of alcoholic stimulants, even though not\r\noffered for sale within state limits. In Georgia wine cannot be used at\r\nthe communion service, nor can druggists sell any form of liquor except\r\npure alcohol. In Louisiana it is illegal for representatives of \"wet\r\ndistricts\" to solicit orders for liquor in any of the \"dry districts.\"\r\nIn Texas the sale of liquor in dining cars is forbidden, and the\r\ntraveler may not even drink from his own flask. Congress is being urged\r\nby senators and congressmen, as well as by anti-saloon advocates, to\r\npass laws prohibiting common carriers from delivering alcoholics to any\r\n\"dry\" community. The more optimistic anti-saloon workers believe it is\r\nbut a matter of a short time when Congress will pass laws prohibiting\r\nthe manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages within any limits\r\nprotected by the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nSouthern states have been warned that they could not afford the\r\ndepreciation of real estate values, of rents, and of business that\r\nwould surely follow the \"confiscation of capital\" and \"interference\r\nwith personal liberty.\" This warning has been met by plausible\r\narguments that the buyers of legitimate and nonpoisonous commodities\r\ncould pay better rents, better profits on business and on real estate,\r\nif freed from the uneven fight against temptation to drink. The\r\nargument that schools and streets and health must suffer if the license\r\nmoney was withdrawn, has been met by the plausible argument that the\r\nultimate taxpayer--the family that wants clothing, food, and\r\nshelter--will save enough money to be able to spend still larger sums\r\nthan heretofore upon education, health, and public safety.\r\n\r\nFor the first time dealers in alcohol recognize the possibility of a\r\ngreat national movement and of national prohibition. Both the defects\r\nin methods hitherto used to oppose saloon legislation and the reasons\r\nfor meeting the present situation by new methods are presented in the\r\nMay issue (1907) of the _Transactions of the American Brewing\r\nInstitute_. Under the title, \"Social Order and the Saloon--the Measure\r\nof the Brewer's Responsibility,\" Mr. Hugh F. Fox, known throughout the\r\nUnion as a defender of child rights, advocate of probation and\r\nchildren's courts, promoter of health and education, outlined a plan\r\nfor research that is indispensable to the proper settling of this great\r\nquestion. Whether brewer or anti-saloon leaguist, total abstainer or\r\nmoderate drinker, employer or trade unionist, it is necessary to the\r\nintelligent control of alcohol that each of us approach this momentous\r\nquestion of control or abolition of the saloon in the spirit expressed\r\nin this paper, whose thoroughness and whose social point of view would\r\ndo credit to a church conference. The address is quoted and its\r\nquestions copied because both show how much depends upon knowing\r\nwhether laws are enforced and how much greater is the difficulty of\r\ncoping with a conciliatory antagonist who professes willingness to\r\nsubmit to tests of evidence.\r\n\r\n  The regulation of the liquor business involves fundamental\r\n  questions of the function and scope of government, and there is\r\n  hardly any department of organized human activity that has been\r\n  the subject of so much experiment and futile tinkering.... The\r\n  only people who are perfectly consistent are the prohibitionists,\r\n  whose policy is abolition. Let us, however, try to detach\r\n  ourselves from any personal interest that we may have in the\r\n  subject, and consider it impartially as a matter of public\r\n  concern.\r\n\r\n  What the brewer as an individual cannot do, the brewers as an\r\n  organization have done successfully in many places in spite\r\n  sometimes of official negligence, corruption, or incapacity. The\r\n  Texas Brewers' Association is reported as having successfully\r\n  prosecuted two thousand cases against keepers of disreputable\r\n  resorts during the past three years. The object of their campaign\r\n  was to purify the retail liquor trade from unclean and law-defying\r\n  elements.\r\n\r\n  The greatest gain that has come to society, as distinguished from\r\n  the individual, through the temperance movement is its effect in\r\n  unconsciously informing the public that the regulation and\r\n  administration of licensing is in itself a great and vital\r\n  problem; and as a secondary result of such agitation, I should\r\n  cite the growing sensitiveness of all persons in the business to\r\n  the power of public opinion.\r\n\r\n  The recognition by brewers of the force of public opinion is a\r\n  recent affair. In former years they were totally indifferent to\r\n  it, if indeed they did not openly flout it. Even now their appeal\r\n  to public sentiment is mainly a special plea for defensive\r\n  purposes, and has little or no educational value. Brewers have\r\n  opposed practically every effort to effect a change in excise\r\n  laws, often without any convincing reason, but simply because the\r\n  proposed change involved temporary inconvenience and uncertainty,\r\n  and perhaps a temporary loss. The brewing trade has utterly failed\r\n  to develop a constructive programme in connection with the public\r\n  regulation of its affairs. It does not seem to have any fixed\r\n  principles or positive convictions as to excise methods and liquor\r\n  laws. Its policy has been that of an opportunist, at the best,--or\r\n  an obstructionist, at the worst. As in all other industries which\r\n  affect the welfare of the people, reforms have been forced from\r\n  the outside, with no help from within. Of course this is equally\r\n  true of insurance and railroad corporations, of food purveyors,\r\n  mine owners, cotton merchants, and a score of other interests. It\r\n  is due not merely to human selfishness but to shortsightedness; in\r\n  other words, to a lack of statesmanship.\r\n\r\n  To call your opponents hypocrites, cranks, fakirs, and fanatics\r\n  may relieve your feelings, but it doesn't convince anybody, and\r\n  only hurts a just cause. It is foolish to question the motives of\r\n  men who, without thought of personal gain, are trying to remedy\r\n  the evils of inebriety.\r\n\r\n  The church is perfectly right in urging total abstinence upon the\r\n  individual. The only path of safety lies in abstinence for some\r\n  individuals....\r\n\r\n  The recognition of the right of a community to establish its own\r\n  licensing conditions carries with it the right of the community to\r\n  determine whether there shall be any licenses at all!\r\n\r\n  To make the discussion of this subject as fruitful as possible, I\r\n  venture to submit the following questions for your consideration.\r\n  None of them involve any direct moral issue, but there is an\r\n  honest difference of opinion about each one of them, and they are\r\n  certainly of vital importance in determining the course of wise\r\n  and just administration.\r\n\r\n  What has been the effect of high license?\r\n\r\n  How much public revenue should the traffic yield?\r\n\r\n  Does high license stimulate unlawful trade?\r\n\r\n  How much license tax should be imposed upon local bottlers and\r\n  grocers? Should they be allowed to peddle beer or to sell it in\r\n  single bottles?\r\n\r\n  Should the place or the individual be licensed?\r\n\r\n  Should the licensing authorities be appointive or elective? By\r\n  whom should they be appointed, and for what term of office?\r\n\r\n  Have the courts made good or bad licensing authorities? Where the\r\n  courts issue licenses, what has been the effect on the court?\r\n\r\n  Should the licensing authority alone have the power to revoke a\r\n  license, and discretion to withhold a license?\r\n\r\n  How can the licensing authority enforce the law? Should it not be\r\n  independent of the police?\r\n\r\n  What should be the penalty for breach of the law? Do not severe\r\n  penalties miscarry?\r\n\r\n  On what plea, and under what conditions, should licenses be\r\n  transferred?\r\n\r\n  What has been the effect of limiting the number of saloons?\r\n\r\n  Should limitation be according to area or to population?\r\n\r\n  Is there any relation between the number of saloons and the volume\r\n  of consumption?\r\n\r\n  What should be the limit to the hours of selling?\r\n\r\n  Should saloons be allowed to become places of entertainment?\r\n\r\n  How can the sale of liquor by druggists be controlled?\r\n\r\n  How can spurious drinking clubs be prevented or controlled?\r\n\r\n  How can the operation of disreputable hotels be prevented? What\r\n  should be the definition of a hotel? Who should define it? By whom\r\n  should it be licensed? What special privileges should be given to\r\n  it?\r\n\r\n  How can the \"back-room\" evil be stopped? Is it legal (i.e.\r\n  constitutional) to prohibit the sale or serving of liquor to\r\n  women?\r\n\r\n  Has the removal of screens reduced the volume of consumption? Has\r\n  it improved the character of saloons? Has it solved the problem of\r\n  Sunday prohibition for any length of time? What has been the\r\n  general effect of it in the tenement districts?\r\n\r\n  Should the state undertake to regulate the liquor business or to\r\n  enforce liquor laws?\r\n\r\n  Is it possible to devise any working plan which will apply with\r\n  equal effectiveness and equity in communities of compact and of\r\n  scattered population?\r\n\r\n  Should, or should not, the principle of self-government be\r\n  carefully preserved in the whole scheme of legislation to regulate\r\n  the liquor business?\r\n\r\nWhether the present prohibition wave shall wash away the legalized\r\nsaloon, as ocean waves have from time to time engulfed peninsulas,\r\nislands, and whole continents, depends upon the power of American\r\neducators and American officials to answer right such questions as the\r\nforegoing. The great danger is that we shall, as usual, over-emphasize\r\nlawmaking, underemphasize lawbreaking, and go to sleep during the next\r\ntwo or three years when we should be wide-awake and constantly active\r\nin seeing that the law is enforced. Unless exactly the same principles\r\nof law enforcement are applied in \"dry districts\" as we have urged for\r\neradication of smallpox, typhoid, scarlet fever, and adenoids, local\r\nand city prohibition are doomed to failure. There must be:\r\n\r\n  1. Inspection to discover disease centers--\"blind pigs,\" \"blind\r\n  tigers,\" etc.\r\n\r\n  2. Compulsory notification by parents and landlords, and by police\r\n  and other officials.\r\n\r\n  3. Prompt investigation upon complaint from private citizens.\r\n\r\n  4. Prompt removal of the disease and disinfection of the center.\r\n\r\n  5. Segregation of individual units that disseminate disease,\r\n  whether bartender, saloon keeper, owner of premises, or\r\n  respectable wholesaler, none of whom should be permitted to shift\r\n  to another the responsibility for violating liquor laws.\r\n\r\n  6. Persistent publicity as to the facts regarding enforcement and\r\n  violation, so that no one, whether saloon leaguist or anti-saloon\r\n  leaguist, shall be uninformed as to the current results of \"dry\"\r\n  laws.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly safe to assume that none of these things will be done\r\nconsistently unless funds are provided to pay one or more persons in\r\neach populous locality to give their entire time to the enforcement of\r\nlaws, just as the improvement of other ills of municipal government\r\nrequire the constant attention of trained investigators. Cogent\r\narguments for such funds have recently appeared in the _New York\r\nEvening Post's_ symposium on \"How to Give Wisely,\" by Mrs. Emma Garrett\r\nBoyd, of Atlanta, and Miss Salmon, of Vassar College.\r\n\r\nIf the saloon is here to stay, we must all agree that it is a frightful\r\nwaste of human energy and of educational momentum to be appealing for\r\nits abolition when we might be hastening its proper control. On the\r\nother hand, if the saloon is destined to be abolished as a public\r\nnuisance and a private wrong, as a menace to industry and social order,\r\nis it not a frightful, unforgivable waste of energy to permit\r\nprohibition laws to fail, and thus to discredit the principle of\r\nprohibition? Philanthropists have provided millions for scientific\r\nresearch, for medical research, for the study of tuberculosis, and for\r\nthe study of living conditions. It is to be hoped that a large\r\nbenefaction, or that an aggregation of small benefactions, will apply\r\nto governmental attempts to regulate the sale of alcohol those methods\r\nof scientific research which have released men from the thraldom of\r\nignorance and diseases less easily preventable than alcoholism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nIS IT PRACTICABLE IN PRESENTING TO CHILDREN THE EVILS OF ALCOHOLISM TO\r\nTELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf children are taught that the most effective way of combating\r\nalcoholism is to insure the enforcement of existing laws and to profit\r\nfrom lessons taught by such enforcement; if children are taught that\r\nthe strongest reasons for total abstinence are social, economic, and\r\nindustrial rather than individual and physiological,--there is much to\r\nbe gained and little to lose from telling them the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth about alcohol. To stimulate a child's\r\nimagination by untruths about alcohol is as vicious as to stimulate his\r\nbody with alcohol. Whisky drinking does not always lead to drunkenness,\r\nto physical incapacity, to short life, or to obvious loss of vitality.\r\nBeer drinking is not always objected to by employers. Neither crime,\r\npoverty, immorality, lack of ambition, nor ignorance can always be\r\ntraced to alcohol. On the contrary, it is unquestionably true that the\r\nmajority of the nation's heroes have used alcoholics moderately or\r\nexcessively for the greater part of their lives. It is probably true\r\nthat among the hundred most eminent officials, pastors, merchants,\r\nprofessors, and scientists of to-day, the great majority of each class\r\nare moderate users of one or more forms of alcoholics. Overeating of\r\npotatoes or cake or meat, sleeping or working in ill-ventilated rooms,\r\nneglect of constipation, may occasion physiological and industrial\r\ninjuries that are not only as grave in themselves as the evils of\r\nmoderate drinking, but, in addition, actually tempt to moderate\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nAll of this can be safely admitted, because whether parents and\r\nteachers admit it or deny it, children by observation and by reading\r\nwill become convinced that up to the year 1908 the noblest and the most\r\nsuccessful men of America, as well as the most depraved and least\r\nsuccessful, have used alcoholics. To be candid enough to admit this\r\nenables us to gain a hold upon the confidence and the intelligence of\r\nchildren and youth that will strengthen our arguments, based upon\r\nsocial and industrial as well as physiological grounds, against running\r\nthe risks that are inevitably incurred by even the moderate use of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, the same man will do better work without\r\nalcohol than with alcohol; the same athlete will be stronger and more\r\nalert without alcohol than with alcohol; the clerk or lawyer or teacher\r\nwill win promotion earlier without alcohol than with alcohol; man or\r\nwoman will grow old quicker with than without alcohol. Other things\r\nbeing equal, a man of fifty will have greater confidence in a total\r\nabstainer than in a man of identical capacity who uses alcohol\r\nmoderately; a mother will give better vitality and better care to her\r\nchildren without than with alcohol; a policeman or fireman or\r\nstenographer is more apt to win promotion without than with alcohol.\r\nWhatever the physical ailment, there is in every instance a better\r\nremedy for an acute trouble, and infinitely better remedies for\r\ndeep-seated troubles, than alcoholics.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of failure to use alcoholics moderately is so high, the\r\nuncertainty as to a particular individual's ability to drink moderately\r\nis so great, as to lead certain insurance companies, first, to give\r\npreference to men who never use alcoholics, and later, to refuse to\r\ninsure moderate drinkers. Life insurance companies have the general\r\nrule that habitual drinkers are bad risks, as the alcohol habit is\r\nprejudicial to health and longevity; but they have no means of studying\r\nthe risk of moderate drinkers, because, except where alcohol has\r\nalready left a permanent impression upon the system, the indications\r\nare by no means such as to enable the medical examiner to trace its\r\nexistence with certainty. For this reason the life insurance companies\r\nhave little effect in _preventing_ alcoholism. Though they are agreed\r\nthat habitual drinkers ought to be declined altogether, only a few\r\ncompanies have taken the decided stand of declining them. \"Habitual\r\ndrinkers, if not too excessive, are admitted into the general class\r\nwhere the expected mortality, according to the experience of the\r\nPennsylvania Mutual Life Insurance Company, is 80 per cent, as against\r\n56 per cent for the temperate class. Though it is only necessary to\r\nlook over the death losses presented each day to see that intemperance\r\nin the use of liquors, as shown by cirrhosis of the liver, Bright's\r\ndisease, diseases of the heart, brain, and nervous system, is the cause\r\nof a large proportion of the deaths, these companies prefer to grade\r\nthe premiums accordingly rather than to decline habitual drinkers\r\naltogether. While this is partly due to the difficulty and expense of\r\ndiagnosis, it is more probably due to an objection to take a definite\r\nstand on the temperance question.\"\r\n\r\nThus the insurance companies' rules touch only the confirmed drinker,\r\nwhose physique is often irreparably injured. One company writes: \"Men\r\nwho have been intemperate and taken the Keeley or other cures are never\r\naccepted until five years have elapsed from the date of taking the\r\ncure, and only when it can be conclusively shown that during the whole\r\nperiod they have refrained entirely from the use of alcoholic liquor,\r\nand that their former excesses have not in any way impaired the\r\nphysical risk.\"\r\n\r\nThus far American insurance companies are doing little preventive and\r\neducational work on the alcohol question, though they have the very\r\nbest means at their command for so doing. According to the Metropolitan\r\nLife Insurance Company nine tenths of the school children in New York\r\nCity are insured by them, and an even greater proportion of workingmen.\r\nEven though this is done \"at twice the normal cost,\" the most cursory\r\nmedical examination is given and no attempt is made to instruct them in\r\nthe relation of their physical condition to their working power, or in\r\nthe evils of the alcohol and the smoking habits.\r\n\r\nNaturally the moderate drinker is first rejected for positions where an\r\noccasional overindulgence would be most noticeable and most serious.\r\nThe manager of a large factory tells his men: \"You cannot work here\r\nunless you are sober. If you must drink at parties, stay at home if\r\nnecessary until 12 o'clock the next day and sleep it off, but don't\r\ncome here till you are straight. We cannot afford it.\" Occasionally his\r\nmen stay at home and not a word is said, but the minute they are found\r\nat work in an unsteady condition they are summarily discharged. From\r\nthis position it is but a step to that of an upholsterer in New York\r\nCity, who prints on his order blanks, \"No drinking man employed.\" His\r\ncompany recently discharged a man after twenty years of service because\r\na customer for whom this man was working detected a whisky breath. Men\r\nreported to trade unions for frequent intoxication are blacklisted. A\r\ncertain financial corporation permits no liquor on its grounds or in\r\nits lunch rooms. The head of one of its large branches was heard to say\r\nrecently that he would discharge on the spot a man who showed evidences\r\nof drinking, even though he had previously worked faithfully for years.\r\n\r\nRejection of moderate drinkers by business houses is not done on moral\r\ngrounds alone, but because experience has proved the danger of\r\nemploying men who have not their faculties fully under control _all_\r\nthe time they are at work. The rules are especially strict for men\r\nworking for a railroad or street railway company. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company replied to my inquiry as to their custom of\r\ndiscriminating against drinking men in these words: \"We have no printed\r\nrules in regard to this except in a general way,--that no employee is\r\nallowed to go into a saloon during his hours of work or wearing the\r\ncompany's uniform. Of course the men are promptly discharged or\r\ndisciplined if they show the effects of liquor while on duty, and the\r\nwhole tendency of the administration of the rules is to get rid of any\r\nmen who are habitual drinkers, but the administration of the rules and\r\ndiscipline is left to the superintendent of each division.\" The\r\nInterborough Rapid Transit Company of New York has these printed rules\r\nfor the physical standard required for applicants for employment:\r\n\r\n  1. _Examination of heart and arteries._ Rejection of candidates\r\n  showing excessive or long-continued use of tobacco and alcohol,\r\n  with explanation of condition, causes, and dangers of continued\r\n  use. Warning to chiefs of departments regarding those accepted who\r\n  show tendency to drink at times, but whose physical examination\r\n  does not disclose sufficient evidence to warrant their\r\n  disqualifications. Foremen and chiefs of departments to be\r\n  notified and to carry out the policy of employing only men who are\r\n  at all times sober and not under the influence of alcohol at all.\r\n\r\n  2. _On reexamination of employees._ Warning to or rejection of\r\n  those showing, on physical examination, indulgence to excess of\r\n  alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. Warning to chief of department of\r\n  evidence of such habits on part of any employee examined for any\r\n  reason, but retained in service of the company with injunction to\r\n  chief of department to speak with such employee and have him under\r\n  proper supervision.\r\n\r\nThe blacklisting of habitual drinkers by their union, and the growing\r\ntendency on the part of large corporations, factories, and business\r\nhouses to take a decided stand against drinking, are having a marked\r\neffect in reducing drunkenness where it does most harm. This practice\r\nhas been declared by John Bach McMasters, the noted American historian,\r\nto have exerted a stronger influence in promoting temperance and total\r\nabstinence than all the temperance crusades from Hartley's time to the\r\nprohibition wave of 1907. The school, by instructing children how the\r\nalcohol habit will affect their chances of business success, future\r\nusefulness as citizens, and enjoyment of life, will inevitably reduce\r\nthe evils of alcohol. By teaching based on facts that intimately\r\nconcern the life of the child, as well as by caring for his health and\r\nhis environment, the schools can help supplant the desire for alcohol\r\nwith other more healthy desires.\r\n\r\nNo truth about alcohol is more important than that the craving for\r\nalcohol or something just as bad will exist side by side with imperfect\r\nsanitation, too long hours of work, food that fails to nourish, lack of\r\nexercise, rest, and fresh air. Conditions that produce bounding\r\nvitality and offer freedom for its expression at work and at play will\r\nsupplant the craving for stimulants. Finally, the great truth contained\r\nin the last chapter must be taught, that success in coping with\r\nalcoholism is a community task requiring efficient government above all\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nFIGHTING TOBACCO EVILS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessarily vicious or harmful to soothe excited nerves.\"\r\nThis editorial comment explains, even if it condemns while trying to\r\njustify, the tobacco habit. To soothe excited nerves by lying to them\r\nabout their condition and by weakening where we promise to nourish, is\r\nvicious and harmful just as other lying and robbery are vicious and\r\nharmful. Yet two essential facts in dealing with tobacco evils must be\r\nconsidered: tobacco does soothe excited nerves, and the harm done to\r\nthe majority of smokers seems to them to be negligible. For these two\r\nreasons the tobacco user, unless frightened by effects already visible,\r\nrefuses to listen to physiological arguments against his amiable\r\nself-indulgence. Cheerfully he admits the theoretical possibility that\r\nby its method of soothing nerves tobacco kills nerve energy. But in all\r\nsincerity he points to men who have found the right stopping point up\r\nto which tobacco hurts less perhaps than coffee or tea, candy or\r\nlobster, overeating or undersleeping. Therefore the physician, the\r\nbishop, the school superintendent, candidly run the necessary risk for\r\nthe sake of nerve soothing and sociability.\r\n\r\nLess harm would be done by tobacco if it were more harmful. Like so\r\nmany other food poisons, its use in small quantities does not produce\r\nthe prompt, vivid, unequivocal results that remove all doubt as to the\r\nuser's injuries and intemperance. As inability to see the physiological\r\neffect upon himself encourages the tobacco user to continue smoking or\r\nchewing, so failure to identify evil physiological effects upon the\r\nsmoker encourages the nonuser to begin smoking or chewing. A very few\r\nsmokers give up the habit because they fear its results, but too often\r\nthe man who can see the evil results would rather give up almost\r\nanything else. The one motive that most frequently stops inveterate\r\nsmoking--fear--is the least effective motive in dissuading those who\r\nhave not yet acquired the habit; every young man, unless already\r\nsuffering from known heart trouble, thinks he will smoke moderately and\r\nwithout harm. Unfortunately, every boy who begins to smoke succeeds in\r\npicturing to himself the adult who shows no surface sign of injury from\r\ntobacco, rather than some other boy who has been stunted physically,\r\nmentally, and morally by cigarettes.\r\n\r\nFor adult and child, therefore, it behooves us to find some other\r\nweapons against tobacco evils in addition to fear of physiological\r\ninjuries. Among these weapons are:\r\n\r\n1. Enforcement of existing laws that make it an offense against society\r\nfor dealer, parent, or other person to furnish children under sixteen\r\nwith tobacco in any form; and raising the age limit to twenty-one, or\r\nat least to eighteen.\r\n\r\n2. Enforcement of restrictions as to place and time when smoking is\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n3. Agitation against tobacco as a private and public nuisance.\r\n\r\n4. Explanation of commercial advantages of abstinence.\r\n\r\nBecause the childish body quickly shows the injurious effects of what\r\nin adults would be called moderate smoking, the proper physical\r\nexamination of school children will reveal injuries which in turn will\r\nshow where and to what extent the cigarette evil exists among the\r\nchildren of a community. Even the scientists who claim that \"in some\r\ncases tobacco aids digestion,\" or that \"tobacco may be used without bad\r\neffects when used moderately by people who are in condition to use it,\"\r\ndeclare emphatically that tobacco \"must not be used in any form by\r\ngrowing children or youths.\" Prohibitive laws can be rigidly enforced\r\nif a small amount of attention is given to organizing the strong\r\npublic sentiment that exists against demoralizing children by tobacco.\r\nThus children and youths will not need to make a decision regarding\r\ntheir own use of tobacco until after other arguments than physiological\r\nfear have been used for many years by parent, teacher, and society.\r\n\r\nOne effective weapon is the sign on a ferryboat or street car: \"No\r\nsmoking allowed on this side,\" or \"Smoking allowed on three rear seats\r\nonly.\" Public halls and vehicles in increasing numbers either prohibit\r\nsmoking altogether or put smokers to some considerable inconvenience.\r\nThe trouble involved in going to places where smoking is permitted\r\ntends gradually to irritate the nerves beyond the power of tobacco to\r\nsoothe. Again, many men would rather not soothe their excited nerves\r\nafter five, than have their nerves excited all day waiting for freedom\r\nto smoke. Restrictions as to time or place make possible and expedite\r\nstill further restrictions. Thus gradually the army of occasional\r\nsmokers or nonsmokers is being recruited from the army of regular\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\nThe anti-nuisance motive follows closely upon the drawing of sharp\r\nlines of time and place for the use of tobacco. Like treason, smoking\r\nin the presence of nonsmokers can be considered respectable only when\r\nthe numbers who profess and practice it are numerous. If the two\r\nfirst-mentioned weapons are effectively used, there will be an\r\nincreasing proportion of nonsmokers and not-yet-smokers who will give\r\nattentive ear to proof that nicotinism is a nuisance. The physical\r\nevidences of the cigarette habit can easily be made distasteful to all\r\nnonsmokers if frankly pointed out,--the yellow fingers, the yellow\r\nteeth, the nasty breath, the offensive excretions from the pores that\r\nsaturate the garments of all who cannot afford a daily change of\r\nunderwear. The anti-nuisance argument is always insidious and abiding.\r\nIn the presence of nonsmokers accustomed to regard tobacco using as a\r\nnuisance, smokers become self-conscious and sensitive. Men and women\r\nalike would prefer a reputation for cleanliness to the pleasures of\r\ntobacco. The educational possibility of fighting tobacco with the name\r\n\"nuisance\" was recognized the other day by an editorial that protested\r\nagainst a law to prevent women from using cigarettes in restaurants.\r\n\"The way for any man who has the desire to reform some woman addicted\r\nto the cigarette habit is insidiously and gently to point out the\r\ninjurious effects on her appearance. Cigarette smoking stains a woman's\r\nfingers and discolors her teeth. It also tends to make her complexion\r\nsallow and to detract from the rubiness of her lips. It bedims the\r\nsparkle of her eyes. It makes her less attractive mornings.\" Chewing\r\nhas practically disappeared, not because it ceased to soothe excited\r\nnerves but because it was seen to be a nasty nuisance.\r\n\r\nFinally, the selfishness of the smoker is a nuisance that continues\r\nonly because it has not been called by its right name. \"Do you mind if\r\nI smoke?\" was a polite question two hundred years ago when tobacco was\r\nrare enough to make smoking a distinction, or fifty years ago when\r\neverybody smoked at home and in public. But it is effrontery to-day\r\nwhen people do mind, when smoking pollutes the air of drawing room and\r\noffice, and while soothing the excited nerves of the smoker lowers the\r\nvitality of nonsmokers compelled to breathe smoke-laden air. It is\r\nselfish to intrude upon others a personal weakness or a personal\r\nappetite. It is selfish to divert from family purposes to \"soothing\r\nexcited nerves\" even the small amounts necessary to maintain the cigar\r\nor cigarette habit. It is selfish to run the risk of shortening one's\r\nlife, of reducing one's earning capacity. Because the tobacco habit is\r\nselfish it is anti-social and a nuisance, and should be fought by\r\nsocial as well as personal weapons, as are other recognized nuisances,\r\nsuch as spitting in public or offensive manners.\r\n\r\nThe economic motive for avoiding and for eliminating tobacco is gaining\r\nin strength. The soothing qualities of all drugs are found to be\r\nexpensive to physical and business energy if enjoyed during business\r\nhours. Strangely enough, employers who smoke are quite as apt as are\r\nnonsmokers, to forbid the use of tobacco by employees at work. Some of\r\nthis seeming inconsistency is due to a dislike for cheaper tobacco or\r\nfor mixed brands in one atmosphere; some of it is due to the smoker's\r\nknowledge that \"soothing nerves\" and sustained attention do not go hand\r\nin hand, while \"pipe dreams\" and unproductive meditation are fast\r\ncompanions; finally no little of the opposition to tobacco in business\r\nis due to fear of fire. These various motives, combining with the\r\nanti-nuisance motive among nonsmokers, have led many business\r\nenterprises to prohibit the use of tobacco in any form on their\r\npremises or during business hours, even when on the premises of others.\r\nNotable examples are railroads that permit no passenger trainman to use\r\ntobacco while on duty. (Freight trainmen are restricted more tardily\r\nbecause the risk of damages is less and the anti-nuisance objection is\r\nwanting.)\r\n\r\nFrom penalizing excessive use and prohibiting moderate use in business\r\nhours, it is a short cut to choosing men who never use tobacco and thus\r\nnever suffer any of its effects and never exhibit any of its offensive\r\nevidences. No young man expects to obtain a favorable hearing if he\r\noffers himself for employment while smoking or chewing tobacco.\r\nBusiness men dislike to receive tobacco-scented messengers. Cars and\r\nelevators contain signs prohibiting lighted cigars or cigarettes.\r\nInsurance companies reject men who show signs of excessive use of\r\ntobacco. Why? Because they are apt to die before their time. The\r\nInterborough Rapid Transit Company of New York City rejects applicants\r\nfor motormen and conductors \"for excessive or long-continued use of\r\ntobacco.\" Why? Because, other things being equal, such men are more\r\napt to lose their nerve in an emergency and to fail to read signals or\r\ninstructions correctly.\r\n\r\nArmed with these weapons against tobacco, parents and teachers can\r\neffectively introduce physiological arguments against excessive use,\r\nagainst use by those who suffer from nervous or heart trouble, and\r\nagainst any use whatever by those who have not reached physical\r\nmaturity. By avoiding physiological arguments that children will\r\nnot--cannot--believe contrary to their own eyes, parents and teachers\r\nare able to speak dogmatically of that which children will\r\nbelieve,--injuries to children, evils of excess, restrictions as to\r\ntime and place, and offensiveness to nonsmokers. But even here it is\r\nwrong, as it is inexpedient, to leave the physical strength of the next\r\ngeneration to the persuasive power of parents and teachers or to the\r\nfaith and knowledge of minors. Society should protect all minors\r\nagainst their own ignorance, their own desires, the ignorance of\r\nparents and associates, and against the economic motive of tobacco\r\nsellers by machinery that enforces the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE PATENT-MEDICINE EVIL\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Dhrugs,\" says Dock O'Leary, \"are a little iv a pizen that a\r\n  little more iv wud kill ye. Ye can't stop people fr'm takin'\r\n  dhrugs, an' ye might as well give thim somethin' that will look\r\n  important enough to be inthrojuced to their important and fatal\r\n  cold in th' head.

He says if people wud on'y call him in\r\n  befure they got sick he'd abolish ivry disease in th' ward except\r\n  old age and pollyticks.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Dooley with his usual wit and insight tells the American\r\npeople why they spend over two hundred million dollars annually on\r\npatent medicines. Americans consume more drugs and use more patent\r\nmedicines than the people of any other country on the civilized globe.\r\nSelf-medication has grown to tremendous proportions. Everywhere--in\r\ncars, on transfers, on billboards, in magazines, in newspapers, in the\r\nmails--are advertised medicines to cure disease and devices to promote\r\nhealth. When we consider that electric cars contain from thirty-two to\r\nfifty-two advertisements each, three fourths of which are directly or\r\nindirectly concerned with health; when we multiply these by the number\r\nof cars actually in use in American cities; when we consider the number\r\nof advertisements in magazines and daily papers, and the enormous\r\ncirculation of these papers and magazines; when we consider that an\r\nincreasingly large proportion of advertising space is devoted to\r\nhealth,--we begin to realize the cumulative power for good or for evil\r\nthat health advertisements must have.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate advertisements devoted to health to-day, I have kept\r\nclippings for one week of news items, editorials, and advertisements in\r\na penny and a three-cent paper, and had them classified according to\r\nthe subjects treated:\r\n\r\n===================+=========================+========================\r\n                   |     PENNY PAPER         |  THREE-CENT PAPER\r\n                   +------+---------+--------+-----+---------+--------\r\n                   | News |Editorial| Adver- | News|Editorial| Adver-\r\n                   | Item |         |tisement| Item|         |tisement\r\n-------------------+------+---------+--------+-----+---------+--------\r\nMilk               |  3   |   --    |   2    |  3  |   --    |   2\r\nTeeth              |  --  |    1    |   2    |  -- |   --    |   1\r\nShoes              |  --  |   --    |   4    |  -- |   --    |   1\r\nFood               |  1   |   --    |   --   |  1  |   --    |   4\r\nAlcohol            |  1   |   --    |   5    |  3  |   --    |   7\r\nTuberculosis       |  --  |   --    |   1    |  1  |   --    |   --\r\nPatent medicine    |  --  |   --    |  17    |  -- |   --    |   --\r\nConstipation cures |  --  |   --    |   4    |  -- |   --    |   5\r\nEyes               |  3   |   --    |   5    |  1  |   --    |   --\r\nBeauty             |  2   |   5     |   8    |  -- |   --    |   6\r\nGeneral            |  8   |   3     |   3    |  5  |   --    |   --\r\n-------------------+------+---------+--------+-----+---------+--------\r\n  Total            | 18   |   9     |  51    | 14  |   --    |  26\r\n===================+======+=========+========+=====+=========+========\r\n\r\nThe following list of health topics was treated in the advertisements,\r\neditorials, and articles of a popular monthly periodical devoted to\r\nwomen:\r\n\r\n=========================+=========+===========+===============\r\n                         | ARTICLE | EDITORIAL | ADVERTISEMENT\r\n-------------------------+---------+-----------+---------------\r\nBabies                   |   1     |   --      |    11\r\nSoaps and powders        |  --     |   --      |     5\r\nBeauty                   |   3     |   --      |     6\r\nQuack cures              |  --     |    2      |    --\r\nTooth powders            |  --     |   --      |     4\r\nHousehold                |   1     |   --      |     5\r\nFood and cooking         |   1     |   --      |    14\r\nClothes                  |  13     |   --      |     5\r\nTeaching sex laws        |   1     |    2      |    --\r\nMedicine                 |   4     |    1      |    --\r\n-------------------------+---------+-----------+---------------\r\n  Total                  |  24     |    5      |    50\r\n=========================+=========+===========+===============\r\n\r\nBesides the classic patent medicines, such as Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable\r\nCompound, Castoria, Cod Liver Oil, etc., there are \"Colds Cured in One\r\nDay,\" \"Appendixine,\" health foods, massage vibrators, violet rays,\r\nPorosknit underwear, sanitary tooth washes, soaps, vitopathic,\r\nnaturopathic, and faith cures. New ones appear every day,--enough to\r\nmake a really sick person dizzy, let alone a person suffering from\r\nimaginary ailments. All seem to outline my particular symptoms. After\r\nthey have flamed at me in red letters in the surface cars, pursued me\r\nin the elevated and underground, accompanied me out into the country\r\nand back again to the city, greeted me each morning in the daily paper\r\nand in my daily mail, each week or each month in the periodical, the\r\ncoincidence of a familiar package on a drug-store counter seems to be\r\nprovidential and therefore irresistible. I know that I ought to be\r\nexamined by a physician, but I am busy and not unwilling to gamble for\r\nmy health; it cannot kill me and there is a chance that it will cure\r\nme. If there is nothing the matter with us, we may be cured by our\r\nfaith. If we are taking a cure for consumption, the morphine in it may\r\nlull us into thinking we feel better. If we are taking a tonic for\r\nspring fever, the cheap alcohol may excite us into thinking our\r\nvitality has been heightened. Soothing sirup soothes the baby, often\r\ndoping its spirit for life, or soothing it into a sleep from which it\r\nnever wakes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the \"Great American Fraud\" has been exposed\r\nrepeatedly in newspapers and magazines of wide circulation, the appeal\r\nof the quack still catches men and women of intelligence. The other\r\nnight a friend went out to a dinner and conference with a lawyer in the\r\nemploy of the national government. Annoyed by a nagging headache, he\r\nmade for the nearest drug store and ordered a \"headache powder.\" He\r\nadmitted that it was an awful dose, but he had been told that it always\r\n\"did the business.\" He knew the principle was bad, confessed to a\r\nscorn for friends of his whom he knew to be bromo-seltzer fiends, but\r\nhe had the headache and the work to do--a sure cure and a quick one\r\nseemed imperative. The headache was due to overwork, indigestion,\r\nconstipation. Plain food and quiet sleep was what he needed most. But\r\nthe dinner conference plus the headache was the unanswerable argument\r\nfor a dose with an immediate result.\r\n\r\nLast winter an Irish maid slowly lost her rosy cheeks and grew\r\nhollow-eyed and thin. She was taken to a specialist who discovered a\r\nrapidly advancing case of consumption. He said that owing to the girl's\r\nignorance, stupidity, and homesickness, her only chance of recovery was\r\nto return to the \"auld countrie\" at once. The girl agreed to go, but\r\ninsisted on a few days \"to talk it over with her cousins in New York.\"\r\nAfter two weeks had elapsed she was found in a stuffy, overcrowded New\r\nYork tenement. She had found a doctor who had given her a little bottle\r\nof medicine for two dollars, which would cure her in the city. It was\r\nfutile to protest. Days in the unventilated tenement and nights in a\r\n\"dark room\" meant that she would never live to finish the bottle.\r\n\r\nFor a year Miss H. took a patent preparation for chronic catarrh. It\r\nseemed to \"set her up\"; but it so undermined her strength, through its\r\nartificial nerve spur, that chronic catarrh was followed by\r\nconsumption. It later transpired that the cure's chief ingredient was\r\nwhisky, and cheap whisky. A good grandmother, herself a vigorous\r\ntemperance agitator and teetotaler, offered to pay for it as long as my\r\nfriend would take it faithfully. The irony of it makes one wonder how\r\nmany earnest advocates of total abstinence are in reality addicted to\r\nthe liquor habit.\r\n\r\nLast summer a district nurse of the summer corps who visited city\r\nbabies under two years of age encountered in the hallway of a tenement\r\na bevy of frenzied women. A baby lay on the bed gasping and \"rolling\r\nits eyes up into the top of its head.\" The nurse asked the frightened\r\nmother what she had been giving it. \"Nothing at all,\" said the woman.\r\nBut a telltale bottle of soothing sirup showed that the child was dying\r\nfrom morphine poisoning. Happily the nurse came in time to save it.\r\n\r\nIs it not pitiful, this grasping for a poison in an extremity; this\r\nseizing of a defective rope to escape the fire?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LEARNING HOW TO KEEP BABY WELL WITHOUT PATENT\r\n    MEDICINES\r\n    Recreation Pier, New York City, Summer, 1908]\r\n\r\nThe patent-medicine evil cannot be cured by occasional exposure or by\r\noverexposure. Nor can it be cured by legislation, legislation,\r\nlegislation, unless laws are rigidly enforced.\r\n\r\nOccasional exposure is no better than occasional advertising of good\r\nthings. The patent-medicine business thrives on constant, not\r\noccasional, advertising. Leading advertisers expect so little from the\r\nfirst notice that they would not take the trouble to write out a single\r\nadvertisement. That is the reason merchants charge advertising in the\r\nprogrammes of church, festival, and glee-club concert to charity, not\r\nto business. Warning people once does no more lasting good than sending\r\na child to school once a month. The exposure of patent-medicine evils\r\nmust be as constant as efforts to sell the medicines.\r\n\r\nOverexposure is ineffective. It is the evils of patent medicines that\r\ndo harm, not their name and not their patents. The medical profession\r\nhas in vain protested against proprietary medicines. Ethical barriers\r\ncannot be erected by resolution. Calling things unethical does not make\r\nthem unethical. The mere patenting of medicines for profit does not\r\nmake the medicine injurious any more than the mere mixing of unpatented\r\ndrugs makes a physician safe. Physicians who would not themselves\r\npatent a drug will use certain patented drugs whose ingredients are\r\nknown to be safe and uniform. True exposure of patent-medicine evils\r\nwill enable the average physician and the average layman to distinguish\r\nthe dangerous from the safe, the fraud from the genuine, lies from\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nLegislation is needed to crystallize modern knowledge and to establish\r\nin courts the right to protection against the evils of patent\r\nmedicines. The national Pure Food Law, passed January 1, 1907, and now\r\nin force throughout the country, requires on the \"labels of all\r\nproprietary medicines entering into interstate commerce, a statement of\r\nthe quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine, opium, heroin,\r\nchloroform, cannabis indica, chloral hydrate, or acetanilid, or any\r\nderivative or preparation of any such substance contained therein; this\r\ninformation must be in type not smaller than eight-point capital\r\nletters; also _the label shall embody no statement which shall be false\r\nor misleading in any particular_.\" This law does not forbid patent\r\nmedicines nor the use of alcohol and narcotics in patent medicines; it\r\nmerely says, \"Let the label tell, that all who _buy_ may read.\" It does\r\nnot require that all who _run_ may read, for _it does not say that\r\nadvertisements of a patent medicine shall tell the truth about its\r\ningredients or its action on the human body_; only that the label on\r\nthe bottle shall tell. The object of this law is to explain to the\r\nconsumer the exact nature of the medicine. But to the majority of\r\npeople the word \"acetphenitidin\" on the label of a headache medicine\r\ndoes not explain. The new order that requires manufacturers to\r\nsubstitute acetanilid for acetphenitidin does no more than replace fog\r\nwith mist. Protection requires legislation that cannot be evaded by\r\ntechnical terms. The present law requires that packages must be\r\nproperly labeled _on entering the state_. To carry out the national\r\nlaw, state laws should make it an offense for dealers to have in their\r\npossession proprietary medicines without explanatory labels that\r\nexplain. Where state laws to this effect do not exist, the packages\r\nonce in the state may be deprived of their labels and sold as secret\r\nremedies, thus nullifying the whole effect of the national law.\r\n\r\nEnforcement must be insured. Impure drugs may do as much harm as patent\r\nmedicines containing harmful drugs. In New York a vigorous campaign was\r\nrecently inaugurated by the department of health to drive out impure\r\ndrugs. Drugs are dangerous enough at their best. When they are not what\r\nthey pretend to be, whether patented or not, they may take life. One\r\nextreme case where a patient's heart was weakened when it ought to have\r\nbeen strengthened, led to the discovery that practically all of one\r\nparticular drug offered for sale in New York City was unfit to use and\r\ncalculated to kill in the emergency where alone it would be used.\r\nYesterday four lives and several million dollars were lost in a New\r\nYork fire because the hose was rotten or weak. As inspection and\r\ntesting were needed to insure hose equal to emergency pressure, so\r\ninspection and testing of patent medicines and drugs are needed to make\r\nlegislation effectual.\r\n\r\nLegislation and enforcement should reach the newspaper, magazine,\r\nbillboard, street car, that advertises a falsehood or less than the\r\nessential truth regarding drugs, foods, and patent medicines. Public\r\nsentiment condemns the advertising of many opportunities to commit\r\ncrime or to be disorderly or indecent or to injure one's neighbor. The\r\nfacts about hundreds of nostrums can be absolutely determined. The\r\nadvertising agency, whether secular or religious, that carries\r\nmisrepresentation of drugs and foods should be forbidden circulation\r\nthrough the mails. The existence of such advertisements should be made\r\nevidence of complicity in a public offense and punished accordingly.\r\nTreat them as we treated the Louisiana lottery. Boards of health,\r\ninstead of furnishing names to druggists and manufacturers who want to\r\nsell patent foods and medicines, should print circulars exposing\r\nfrauds, and punish so far as the law permits.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to secure adequate legislation and efficient\r\nadministration of the above-mentioned standards, there is much that can\r\nbe done by individuals and clubs. We can give preference to those\r\njournals that refuse drug and food advertisements unless evidence is\r\nproduced that the truth is told and that the goods are not harmful. We\r\ncan refuse to have in the house a paper or journal which prints notices\r\nthat lie or that conceal the truth. If this drastic measure would cut\r\nus off entirely from daily papers, we could choose the least offensive\r\nand petition it to exclude specific lying methods. When it preaches\r\nhealth, honesty, and philanthropy, we can cut out of one issue the\r\nnoble editorial and the exploiting advertisements and send them to the\r\neditor with our protest. Knowledge of the ingredients and dangers of\r\npatent medicines should be a prerequisite for the practice of medicine\r\nor pharmacy. We can help bring about such conditions, and we can\r\npatronize physicians who send patients to drug stores that cater to\r\nintelligence rather than to ignorance.\r\n\r\nFighting patent-medicine evils is a civic duty to be accomplished by\r\ncivic cooeperation, not private effort. It is impossible to organize\r\nunofficial educational agencies that can offset the cumulative, lying\r\nadvertisement. Personal opposition is but the beginning. Official\r\nmachinery must be set running and kept running so as to protect the\r\npublic health against the commercial motive that preys upon ignorance\r\nand easily inspired faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nHEALTH ADVERTISEMENTS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is usually considered futile to attempt to defeat the devil with his\r\nown methods, because he knows so much better how to use them. But abuse\r\ndoes not do away with use, and the success of quacks in reaching the\r\npeople demands our respect. There is no reason why their methods, based\r\non a knowledge of human nature and human psychology, should not be\r\nemployed to appeal to needs rather than to weaknesses. A good thing may\r\nlie unused because of lack of advertisement. Vitality is coming to be\r\nthe passion of the American people. It is on this sincere passion that\r\nfakirs have so long traded.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that advertisements of health-promoting goods are\r\nquite as profitable as health advertisements that injure health, when\r\nequally effective methods are used to make them reach the public. The\r\ntradition has been repeatedly mentioned in this book that the better\r\nthe doctor, the less he advertises himself, except in medical and\r\nscientific journals that notoriously fail to reach the people. The same\r\nis too often true of reputable remedies and goods. The theory that\r\nthese things stand or fall on their merits is not borne out by\r\npractical experience,--conspicuously in the case of \"fake\" remedies.\r\nPurely philanthropic undertakings for the advancement of health fail,\r\nif not placed before the people whom they aim to help in an attractive,\r\nconvincing form. Failure to advertise a worthy cause limits its\r\nusefulness, and is therefore unjustifiable, whether we speak of\r\nmedicine, legal aid, or dental clinics.\r\n\r\nAn intensive study of the methods used to advertise patent medicines\r\nwill suggest means of extending the usefulness of health-promoting\r\ngoods. Aside from clever methods of suggestion that lead many people to\r\ntake medicine for imaginary ailments, especially seasonal ailments,\r\npatent-remedy advertisers have employed (as an argument for the\r\nefficiency of their cures) scientific theory, bacterial origin of\r\ndiseases, recent medical or physiological discoveries, and state and\r\nnational movements for promoting health. In fact, they have turned to\r\ntheir own uses the very law that seeks to control them and the\r\nexposures that seek to exterminate them. Whatever may be the merits of\r\nCastoria, the \"Don't Poison Baby\" advertisement on the following page,\r\nprinted just after the accompanying \"Babies Killed by Patent\r\nMedicines,\" which appeared in a home journal, was surely a clever bit\r\nof advertising. Upon an editorial in a daily paper on the relation of\r\neyeglasses to headache and indigestion, an optician based a promise of\r\nimmediate relief for these ailments if he himself were patronized. The\r\nrecent investigations of the Department of Agriculture, and of\r\nProfessors Chittenden and Fisher, in regard to foodstuffs, are proving\r\nhelpful to food quacks and advertisers of pills for constipation and\r\nindigestion. Since the passage of the Pure Food Law one health food is\r\nadvertised in a column headed \"Pure Food.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the season for pneumonia comes around numerous medicines are \"sure\r\ncures\" for grippe and pneumonia. \"Rosy teachers look better in the\r\nschoolroom than the sallow sort,\" is surely a good introduction to a\r\nnew food. Woman's vanity sells many a remedy advertised to counteract\r\nthe \"vandal hand of disease, which robs her of her beauty, yellows and\r\nmuddies her complexion, lines her face, pales cheek and lip, dulls the\r\nbrilliancy of her eye, which it disfigures with dark circles, aging her\r\nbefore her time.\" Who in your town is as good a friend to \"owners of\r\nbad breath\" as the advertiser who tells them that they \"whiff out odor\r\nwhich makes those standing near them turn their heads away in\r\ndisgust\"? The climax of effective educational advertising as well as of\r\nconsummate presumption and villainy is reached in the notice of an\r\nalcoholic concoction that uses the headline, \"Medical Supervision\r\nNeeded to Prevent the Spread of Consumption in the Schools.\" Thus\r\ngrafting itself on the successful results of the medical examination in\r\nthe Massachusetts schools, it enlists the aid of teachers, trades on\r\nthe fear of tuberculosis, even indorses the fresh-air treatment. So\r\nconvincing was this appeal that it was reprinted in the news columns\r\nof a daily paper in New York as official advice to school children.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Don't Poison Baby.]\r\n\r\nSo clever are these methods of advertising and so successful are they\r\nin reaching great numbers of people, that if reputable physicians would\r\ntake lessons of them, they might conduct a health crusade that would\r\nexterminate tuberculosis, diminish the use of alcohol and tobacco, and\r\nsave thousands of babies that die unnecessarily. The theory of\r\npatent-medicine advertising is sound. It emphasizes the joys of health,\r\nthe beauty of health, the earning power of health. It adapts its\r\nmessage to season, event, and need. It offers testimonials of real\r\npersons cured. It is all-appealing, promising, convincing,--a fearful\r\nmenace to health when the remedies offered are dishonest, a universal\r\nopportunity for promoting health if the cure is genuine.\r\n\r\nA classic example of health advertising that promotes health is\r\nSapolio. The various hygiene lessons that have promoted Sapolio have\r\ndone much to raise the standard of living in the United States. Few\r\neminent physicians have done so much for public health as the \"Poor\r\nM.D. of Spotless Town who scoured the country for miles around, but the\r\nonly case he could find was a case of Sapolio.\"\r\n\r\nRecent press discussions about furnishing free eyeglasses to the\r\nchildren in the public schools have so enlightened people as to the\r\nneed for expert examination of their eyes that opticians will be forced\r\nto employ competent oculists to make the preliminary examination and to\r\nsee that the glasses are properly adjusted. In spite of the long\r\nmis-education by makers of corsets, the persistent advertising of \"good\r\nhealth\" and \"common-sense\" waists has gained an increasing number of\r\nrecruits from the ranks of the self-persecuting. It is only a matter of\r\ntime when the term \"stylish\" will be transferred to the advocates of\r\nhealth, because advertisers who tell the truth will, if persistent,\r\ngain a larger patronage than advertisers of falsehoods; there is\r\nprofit in retaining old customers. The advertisement of a window device\r\nfor \"Fresh air while you sleep\" will make prevention of tuberculosis\r\nmore profitable than \"sure cures\" that lie and kill.\r\n\r\nA man deserves profit who sends this message to millions of readers:\r\n\r\n  There are three kinds of cleanliness:\r\n\r\n  First, the ordinary soap-and-water cleanliness.\r\n\r\n  Second, the so-called \"beauty\" cleanliness.\r\n\r\n  Third, prophylactic cleanliness, or the cleanliness that \"guards\r\n  against disease.\"\r\n\r\nBut the man who sells soap ought to be the one to use this\r\nadvertisement, not a man who sells toothwash that, when pure, is little\r\nbetter than water, that is seldom pure, and that always hurts the\r\nteeth. Many children and adults are being cured of flat foot by men who\r\nmake money by selling shoes designed to strengthen the arch of the\r\nfoot. Millions would never know how to discover the evil effects upon\r\nthemselves of coffee and alcohol except for money-making\r\nadvertisements. Little Jo's Smile taught a nation that the majority of\r\ncrippled children are victims of neglect on the part of adult\r\nconsumptives.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that advertising is an art promoted by the severest\r\ncompetition of the cleverest brains. It is a force which we cannot\r\nafford to ignore. If we can harness it to the promotion of aids to\r\nhealth, it will do more good than all the hygiene books ever written.\r\nTo this end we must educate ourselves to distinguish between goods\r\nwhich do what they profess to do and those which do not. A good eye\r\nopener would be to keep for a week clippings from a high-priced daily\r\npaper, a penny daily paper, and one or two representative magazines,\r\nincluding a religious paper. Teachers and parents can very easily\r\ninterest children in such clippings. Moreover, they can use the\r\nbulletin method, the stereopticon exhibit, the _cumulative\r\nillustration_ of a fact, which is the essence of successful\r\nadvertising. Boards of health can use all the typographical aids to\r\nclear understanding,--cuts, diagrams, interesting anecdotes. In New\r\nYork both the health board and the school board have issued circulars\r\nand given illustrated lectures, some of them being in school and some\r\non public squares. Medical and sanitary societies and other educators\r\ncan be induced to follow what a successful business man has called the\r\nthree cardinal rules of advertising:\r\n\r\n  First, put your advertisement where it will be seen. (Tell your\r\n  story where it will be heard.)\r\n\r\n  Second, write it so that people will read it. (Tell it so that\r\n  people will understand it.)\r\n\r\n  Third, tell the truth, so that people will believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nIS CLASS INSTRUCTION IN SEX HYGIENE PRACTICABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong remedies for preventable disease and preventable poverty, the\r\nfollowing was urged at a national conference for the betterment of\r\nsocial conditions: \"We have been too prudish. Because we have been\r\nunwilling to teach school children the evils of violating sex hygiene,\r\nwe have been unsuccessful in combating evils justly attributable to\r\nignorance on the part of girls as to the duties and dangers of\r\nmotherhood.\" This point of view is shared by so many men and women that\r\na national body was organized in 1905 to promote the teaching of sex\r\nhygiene,--the Society for Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis. This society\r\nhas its headquarters in New York, and distributes at cost lectures and\r\nessays. The second of its educational pamphlets is addressed to\r\nteachers, and is entitled \"Instruction in the Physiology and Hygiene of\r\nSex.\" The introduction asks eleven questions of the teachers as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1. Do you wish a pamphlet on sex subjects to hand to your pupils?\r\n  Why?\r\n\r\n  2. Do you wish separate pamphlets for boys and girls?\r\n\r\n  3. For what age limits and social conditions do you wish them?\r\n\r\n  4. What topics do you wish the pamphlets for boys to \"handle\"?\r\n\r\n  5. What topic do you wish the pamphlet for girls to \"handle\"?\r\n\r\n  6. If you think one pamphlet sufficient for both sexes, what\r\n  should it consider?\r\n\r\n  7. How far do you go in teaching sexual hygiene or reproduction?\r\n  By what method?\r\n\r\n  8. What special difficulties do you find in teaching it?\r\n\r\n  9. What special need of teaching it have you found?\r\n\r\n  10. What special benefits (or otherwise) have you noticed from\r\n  teaching it?\r\n\r\n  11. What criticisms (favorable or otherwise) do you encounter?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of introducing formal instruction in sex hygiene, even\r\nin the upper grades of public and private schools, is hinted at in the\r\npamphlet. The purpose of the publishing society as given in its\r\nconstitution is \"to eliminate the spread of diseases which have their\r\norigin in the social evil.\" Although sex hygiene does not begin with\r\nsex immorality, almost every text-book on sex hygiene, and almost every\r\npamphlet urging class instruction in sex hygiene, begins with sex\r\nimmorality. Yet only the exceptional school child is in danger of\r\nviolating sex morals, while every school child needs instruction in sex\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nInstruction in sex hygiene, whether at school or at home, should deal\r\nwith sex normality, sex health, sex temperance. Instruction in sex\r\nimmorality is objectionable, not merely because it offends prudists,\r\nnot because it is difficult, but because it can be shown by experience\r\nto be less efficacious than training in sex health.\r\n\r\nTo expect fear to prompt sex hygiene is to make a mistake that has\r\nretarded the development of sound measures in the treatment of\r\noffenders against criminal law. For centuries man failed in attempts to\r\nfit the punishment to the crime. To deter men from committing crime by\r\nholding up a threat of prolonged and dreadful punishment has been found\r\nfutile. Individuals take the risk because they think they will escape\r\ndetection. It is an axiom of criminal procedure that a would-be\r\noffender is deterred by the certainty, not by the severity, of\r\npunishment. The modern theory of probation is, that children and adults\r\nmay be best led away from evil practices by crowding out old influences\r\nwith newer and stronger interests. Occupations that are wholesome are\r\nmade to rival diversions or occupations that are harmful and criminal.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OBJECT LESSONS FOR INSTRUCTION IN SEX HEALTH\r\n    Note the uncomfortable, unhealthy overdressing]\r\n\r\nAbnormal conditions of mind and body in regard to sex can almost always\r\nbe traced to general physical ill health or to an unhealthy moral\r\nenvironment. Cure and prevention require two kinds of treatment within\r\nreach of parents and teachers: (1) build up the child's physical\r\ncondition; and (2) give him other interests. Proper physical care, and\r\nwork adjusted to body and mind, may be relied upon to do infinitely\r\nmore to promote sex hygiene than instruction, either at home or at\r\nschool, in immoral sex diseases. That sex morality is weak and\r\nuntrustworthy which is based upon fear of sex diseases. Like alcoholism\r\nand nicotinism, the saddest results of sex diseases are social and\r\neconomic. The strongest reasons against such diseases are economic and\r\nsocial, not physiological.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE STUDY OF INFANT HEALTH IS CONDUCIVE TO\r\n    PURE-MINDEDNESS\r\n    Note the simple, comfortable, hygienic dress]\r\n\r\nOnce having made up our minds to concentrate the teaching of sex\r\nhygiene upon sex health rather than upon sex immorality, upon sex\r\nfunctions rather than upon sex diseases, the chief objection to school\r\ninstruction and to instruction in class will disappear. Our school\r\ntext-books in history, literature, and biology abound in references to\r\nsex distinctions, sex functions, and sex health. In enumerating the\r\ndaily routine of health habits I mentioned daily bathing of the armpits\r\nand crotch. There is nothing in this injunction to offend or injure a\r\nboy or girl. If studies and physical training are to be adapted to\r\nphysiological age, and if children are to know why they are graded\r\naccording to physiological age as well as mental brightness, we shall\r\nsoon be talking of mature, maturing and not-yet-maturing girls and\r\nboys, so that everybody will be instructed in sex hygiene without\r\noffense. Any teacher who can explain the family troubles of King Henry\r\nVIII without becoming self-conscious can easily learn to look a class\r\nof girls and boys in the face and explain how a mother's health will\r\ninjure her baby before its birth, why breast-fed babies are more apt to\r\nlive than bottle-fed babies, why it is as important for the mother to\r\nkeep a nursing breast absolutely clean as to clean the nipple of a\r\nnursing bottle. Words whispered by children, or marked in dictionaries,\r\nto be stealthily and repeatedly looked upon and talked over with other\r\nchildren, lose all their glamour when pronounced by a teacher.\r\n\r\nIn these days of state subsidy of school libraries the child is hard to\r\nfind who has not free access to books of fiction full of voluptuous\r\nallusions that make undesirable impressions which only blunt, candid\r\ndiscussion of sex facts can make harmless. Children now learn, whether\r\nin fashionable private schools or crowded slums, practically all that\r\nis lascivious and unwholesome about sex. For teachers to explain that\r\nwhich is wholesome and pure will disinfect the minds of most children\r\nand protect them against miseducation.\r\n\r\nClass instruction in hygiene is practicable for all matters pertaining\r\nto normal sex health. Girls of thirteen should be taught in classes the\r\nfact and meaning of menstruation, and its grave importance to the\r\nhealth, in order that they may care for themselves not only before,\r\nduring, and immediately after the menstrual period, but throughout the\r\nmonth, in order that menstruation itself shall not be unnecessarily\r\npainful, enervating, and harmful to efficiency. It is not yet advisable\r\nto discuss dangers peculiar to girls or dangers peculiar to boys in\r\nmixed classes. Generally speaking, it is undesirable that men teachers\r\ndiscuss girls' troubles with girl pupils. But why should it not become\r\npossible for women teachers to explain health dangers peculiar to girls\r\nto classes of boys?\r\n\r\nIndividual instruction in sex matters should be reserved for the\r\ndiseased mind, for the boy or girl who has already been morbidly\r\ninstructed. Discussion of immoral sex diseases should be confined to\r\nindividual talk. This field teachers have already entered. Repeated\r\nphysical examination of children will detect symptoms of sex\r\nabnormality. When detected, the fact and the meaning should be\r\nexplained to the individual by school physician, school nurse, or\r\nschool-teacher. While much can be done through mothers' meetings and\r\nthrough individual instruction of parents, the most effective means of\r\nimproving the general attitude towards sex health is to give the simple\r\ntruth to the millions of children who have not yet left school. Armed\r\nwith the A B C's of sex hygiene at school, boys and girls will be\r\nprepared to select employment, associates, and newspapers that will\r\npermit normal, healthy sex development. Men and women who are leading\r\nnormal lives, who have plenty of work, sleep, fresh air, nourishing\r\nfood, amusement, and exercise are unlikely to be sexually abnormal.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the question of instruction in sex hygiene will quickly\r\nsettle itself when it is made a condition of a teacher's certificate\r\nthat the applicant shall himself or herself know the personal and\r\nsocial reasons for sex health. The woman who does not know how to take\r\ncare of her own sex health, the man who is ignorant of a woman's\r\nspecial needs, cannot do justice to the requirements of arithmetic,\r\nlanguage, and discipline. Whether men and women teachers are mentally,\r\nphysically, and morally equipped to be sexually normal and to teach the\r\nlaw of sex health will be disclosed as soon as trustees and\r\nsuperintendent dare to ask the necessary questions. Whether an\r\ninstructor's personality will enable him to fill the minds of children\r\nwith interests more wholesome, more absorbing than obscene stories or\r\nmorbid sex curiosity can also be learned. When school-teachers are\r\nprepared to teach the social and economic aspects of general health\r\nthey will quickly solve the problem of instruction in sex health.\r\n\r\nJust one word about country morality. It is customary to deplore the\r\ninfluence of large cities on the young. Of late, however, there has\r\nbeen a tendency to question whether, after all, sex morality is apt to\r\nbe higher in the country than in the city. Parents and teachers in\r\nsmall towns and in rural districts will do well to take an inventory of\r\nthe influences surrounding their children. It will always be impossible\r\nto give country children city diversions. One great disadvantage of\r\ncountry children frequently counter-acts the beneficial influence of\r\nout-of-door living; namely, isolation. The city child is practically\r\nalways in or about to be in the sight of, if not in the presence of,\r\nother people. Numbers and close contact with people, though they be\r\nstrangers, mean restraint and pervading social conscience. City\r\nchildren find it difficult to have good times in pairs. No amount of\r\ninstruction of rural pupils in sex hygiene will take the place of\r\namusements and entertainments for groups of children, forming thus a\r\nspecial antidote for \"two's company, three's a crowd.\" Liberating and\r\nstandardizing normal intersex relations and discouraging cramped social\r\nintersex relations are more urgent needs than instruction in sex\r\ndiseases. A working environment that permits pure-mindedness will do\r\nmore to inculcate a reverence for sex cleanliness and for parenthood\r\nthan lectures and essays on moral prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTHE ELEMENT OF TRUTH IN QUACKERY; HYGIENE OF THE MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nPatent medicines and other forms of quackery could not pay such\r\nenormous dividends unless there was some truth in their claims; unless\r\ntheir victim found some beneficial return for his money. They win\r\nconfidence because they raise hopes and combat fear. They do cure\r\nthousands of people of fear and of \"ingrowing thoughts.\" In so doing\r\nthey remove the sole cause of much disability.[17] In so doing they are\r\nmerely applying by wholesale principles of mental hygiene that are\r\nlegitimately used by physicians, tradesmen, teachers, and parents who\r\ndeal successfully with nervousness.\r\n\r\nQuackery makes cures and makes money because of the undoubted influence\r\nof mind in causing and in removing those ailments that originate in\r\nfear, imagination, or morbid introspection. A few years ago a little\r\nout-of-the-way town in southern Minnesota was visited by train loads of\r\nthe sick and crippled from miles around. Miraculous cures were heralded\r\nbroadcast. Life-long cripples left wagon loads of crutches and braces\r\nto decorate the little church with the enchanted transom. People who\r\nhad not walked for years returned to their homes cured. The marvels of\r\nfamous shrines were fast being duplicated when the church authorities\r\nat St. Paul issued an explanation of the alleged miraculous appearance\r\nof biblical figures in the transom of the new church. The outlines of a\r\nmother carrying a baby had been vaguely impressed in the transom glass\r\nwhen molten. When the mystery was explained the excursions and the\r\ncures stopped.\r\n\r\nNearly every physician and practically every medical charlatan can\r\ncount scores of cures of ailments that had previously defied the skill\r\nof eminent physicians. A child's bumps actually stop aching after the\r\nmother or nurse kisses the abused spot. Invalids forget their\r\nlimitations under stress of some great excitement or some intense\r\ndesire for pleasures incompatible with invalidism. Many a physician of\r\nreputation owes his success in great part to the discriminating use of\r\nthe _placebo_,--a bread pill designed to supplant the patient's fear\r\nwith confidence. Hypnotism and \"suggestion\" have been successfully used\r\nto cure alcoholism and to fill patients' minds with conviction stronger\r\nthan the fear that produced the sickness. A well-known writer and\r\npreacher cures insomnia by auto-suggestion, telling himself he is\r\nsleepy, is very sleepy, is going to sleep, is almost asleep, is fast\r\nasleep. Treatment by osteopathy has been followed by disappearance of\r\ndiseases that cannot possibly be cured by osteopathy. Christian Science\r\nhas restored to health and happy usefulness hundreds of thousands of\r\nchronic invalids. Verily is hygiene of the mind an important factor in\r\nthe civics of health.\r\n\r\nFear can originate with mind. Fear produces fear. Fear disarranges\r\ncirculation of the blood and the nourishment of muscle and nerve. Fear\r\ncan produce many bodily disorders which in turn feed fear. Fear cannot\r\nlast unless bodily symptoms exist or arise to justify and feed it. Fear\r\ncan be cured and removed in two ways: (1) by driving away fear and\r\nreleasing bodily disorders from its thraldom; (2) by removing the\r\ndisorders and making fear impossible to the logical mind. An enforced\r\nsea voyage begins with the disorder; a clever, buoyant physician begins\r\nwith the fear. Patent-medicine proprietors, quacks, and fakes of every\r\nkind begin by displacing the fear with hope or cheer; the physical\r\ndisorders frequently vanish by the same window as fear. For _fear_\r\nwrite _self-pity_, _morbid self-consciousness_, _hypertrophied\r\nsubmission_; to _hope_ and _cheer_ add _smile_, _relaxation_, and\r\n_zest_; and we have the chief elements of mental hygiene and the reason\r\nwhy intelligent as well as unintelligent men like to be swindled by\r\nmedical or other quacks.\r\n\r\nThe social aspects of mental hygiene are particularly important. Once\r\nadmitting the power of the mind to decrease vitality, we recognize the\r\nduty of seeming happy, buoyant, cheerful, vital, at least when with\r\nothers, for the sake of others' minds and bodies. Secondly, we find the\r\nduty to refrain from commenting on others' appearance in a way that\r\nwill start \"ingrowing thoughts.\" A \"grouchy\" foreman can give blues and\r\nindigestion to a roomful of factory girls. A self-pitying teacher can\r\ncheck the heart beats of her class, cause arteries and lungs to\r\ncontract, and deprive the brain of fresh blood. An oversympathetic\r\nneighbor can put a strong man to bed by discovering signs of nervous\r\ndisintegration. Shall we gradually work out a code of mental hygiene\r\nrights and nuisances that will require compulsory notification of the\r\n\"blues\" and compulsory segregation of every person unable to \"smile\r\ndull care away\"? Is the time coming when boards of health will\r\naccompany infection leaflets with messages such as this from James\r\nWhitcomb Riley:\r\n\r\n    Talk health. The dreary, never-changing tale\r\n    Of mortal maladies is worn and stale.\r\n    You cannot charm or interest or please\r\n    By harping on that minor chord, disease.\r\n\r\n    \"Whatever the weather may be,\" says he,\r\n    \"Whatever the weather may be,\r\n    It's the songs ye sing, and the smiles ye wear,\r\n    That's a-making the sun shine everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nMental hygiene has hitherto enjoyed an evil reputation and has been\r\ncondemned to generally evil associations, because the rank and file\r\nhave been ignorant of hygiene of every kind. Medical science has so\r\nlong enveloped itself in mystery that it is in danger now of becoming\r\ndiscredited and of falling heir to the mantle of quackery.\r\n\r\nQuacks often get social and economic results more agreeable to the\r\npatient and more helpful to society than orthodox medicine. \"When\r\ntraitors become numerous enough treason becomes respectable.\" So when\r\nmental hygiene succeeds, it becomes science for the case in question,\r\nand for that case orthodox medicine loses its respectability. For the\r\nlayman there is no safety except in having intelligence enough to know\r\nwhether his trouble has defied the sincere application of mental\r\ntreatment, auto-suggestion, and loyalty to the health ideal.\r\n\r\nMental hygiene admits the existence of dental cavities, scarlet fever\r\ngerms, adenoids, cross-eyes, uncleanliness, broken legs, inflamed eyes,\r\novereating. The organic, structural defects which are to be sought by\r\nphysical examination are all admitted by mental hygienists. They work\r\nfor an orderly, daily routine and affirm the penalties of its\r\nviolation. They would even favor going periodically to a physician,\r\nprovided that we never go to him except when organic or structural\r\ndisorders may safely be assumed from the fact that cheer and relaxation\r\ntreatment does not give relief. Unhygienic living and mind cure cannot\r\ngo together. The mind that tries to deceive itself cannot cure either\r\nmind or body. The man who violates the habits of health cannot patch\r\nhis injuries or conceal the ravages of dissipation by mental hygiene.\r\nHere is the great advantage of knowing how to live hygienically, of\r\nobserving habits of health, and then concerning ourselves not with\r\nourselves, but with conditions of living for all those whose health can\r\nbe affected by our health, or can affect our health and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe most recent practical application of mental hygiene for moral and\r\nphysical uplifting is the \"moral clinic\" or \"psychotherapeutic\" clinic\r\nestablished by Emmanuel Church in Boston. This clinic represents the\r\nunion of three forces,--religion, medical diagnosis, mental hygiene. As\r\na result of this alliance it is anticipated that both religion and\r\nmedicine will be humanized, socialized, vitalized, made to express more\r\naccurately and more consistently that community consciousness and that\r\nyearning for equal opportunity and equal happiness which constitute the\r\nprofoundest religious impulse. No person is treated at this moral\r\nclinic whose trouble is organic or structural. In determining whether\r\nthe case belongs to this clinic, expert medical diagnosis is relied\r\nupon rather than the credulity of the patient or the zeal of the\r\nclergyman. Medical scientists of highest repute can consistently\r\ncooeperate, because they recognize two scientific facts: first, that\r\nmany troubles are due primarily to mental disorder; and, second, the\r\ngreatest asset of the human mind is that something called religion,\r\nwhich is no less real and potent because peculiar to each individual.\r\nWhatever may be that deepest current of thought and feeling, whatever\r\nthat synthetic philosophy, that explanation of being, which guides my\r\nlife, it can be of inestimable aid if enlisted in an effort to secure\r\nnormal vitality of mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe controlling motive of the moral clinic has proved infectious. There\r\nis reason to believe that the alliance of medicine and religion has\r\ncome to stay, and that the present excitement over psychotherapeutics\r\nwill settle down into a scientific utilization of religious motive and\r\nmedical knowledge to prevent mental and moral disease. Unwholesome,\r\nmorbid, self-centered thought is driven out. A recognition of others'\r\nclaims takes its place. Hypnotism, suggestion, and group enthusiasm are\r\nused to their utmost possibilities. The success of the Boston moral\r\nclinic is due to establishing in the mind of the neurasthenic, the\r\nalcoholic, the world-weary, and the purposeless a truer conception of\r\nthe pleasures that result from vitality and from altruistic effort.\r\n\r\nIt is too early to classify by kind of functional disorder the patients\r\ntreated. Results from one patient have been described in newspapers as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  A school-teacher, as a result of nervous collapse, had lost\r\n  control, began to fear the children under her care, and thought of\r\n  relinquishing her profession. She was instructed in the art of\r\n  self-control and the control of others; the notion of fear was\r\n  dislodged and a sentiment of love for her little charges took its\r\n  place. In the course of a few weeks this conscientious and\r\n  experienced teacher regained her poise and found herself\r\n  performing her duties better than ever before.\r\n\r\nMany alcoholics have for months given evidences of complete cure.\r\nStories almost incredible are quickening pastor and physician alike\r\nthroughout the country. After individual treatments are given, after\r\nreligious motive is appealed to, and the soul stirred to heed the\r\nlessons of religion, medicine, and sociology, patients are given the\r\nwork cure. Thus a branch of social service is established, where\r\nafter-treatment is given to the patient whose thoughts have been turned\r\nfrom himself to others. All of a sudden the church finds itself in need\r\nof definite knowledge as to opportunities for altruistic work, as to\r\ndefinite community needs not met, as to people in distress who can be\r\nrelieved by volunteers, as to agencies which can be called upon to\r\ncooeperate both in treating the individual and in utilizing his energies\r\nfor others' benefits.\r\n\r\nBecause a relatively small percentage of men and women are\r\nneurasthenic, melancholy, morbid, alcoholic, the lesson of the moral\r\nclinic is most serviceable when extended for the benefit of the \"not\r\nyet alcoholic\" and the \"not quite neurasthenic.\" In other words,\r\nindividuals in thinking of themselves must learn the health value and\r\nsoul value of purpose that centers in others' happiness. That thing\r\nwhich we have called tact in personality, and which in the past was\r\ndiscovered by induction, namely, the law of mental hygiene and the\r\ncontrol it gives over others' health, must be taught in schools to\r\nchildren by wholesale, must be taught in medical and theological\r\nschools, to all physicians and all pastors. This alliance of medicine\r\nand religion, which is at present confined to one or two moral clinics,\r\nshould be incorporated into education, into social work, into church\r\nwork, becoming thus a part of civilization's normal point of view.\r\n\r\nMental hygiene cannot survive conscious violation of the fundamental\r\nlaws of medicine and religion. The alliance of medicine and religion\r\nwill prove utterly futile unless habits of living and of thinking are\r\ninculcated that conform to nature's law of self-preservation and to\r\nGod's law of brotherly love. Self-centered religion, like self-centered\r\nmedicine, destroys both body and soul.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] The alliance of mental hygiene, medicine, and religion is discussed\r\nin the Emmanuel Church book, _Religion and Medicine; the Moral Control\r\nof Nervous Disorders_; also in its bulletins, _Religion and Medicine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\"A NATURAL LAW IS AS SACRED AS A MORAL PRINCIPLE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a grammar-school boy I learned from the game \"Quotations\" that\r\nLouis Agassiz, scientist, had written the sentence with which I\r\nintroduce a final appeal for living that will permit physical and civic\r\nefficiency. Agassiz has been called \"America's greatest educator,\" and\r\nagain \"the finest specimen yet discovered of the genus _homo_, of the\r\nspecies _intelligens_.\" The story of his long life as teacher of\r\nteachers reads like a romance. But among his gifts to education and\r\ncitizenship none can be made to mean more than the simple proposition\r\nthat natural law is as sacred as a moral principle. All who remember\r\nthis \"beatitude\" will be helped to solve many perplexing problems of\r\ndress, diet, play, education, philanthropy, morals, and civics.\r\n\r\nReverence for the natural carries with it a distaste for the unnatural.\r\nThose who obey natural law soon come to regard its violation as a\r\nnuisance when not immoral. On the other hand, compromise with the\r\nunnatural, like compromise with vice, quickly leads first to toleration\r\nand thence to interest and practice. Therefore the importance of giving\r\nchildren Agassiz's conception of the sacredness of the laws that govern\r\nthe human body. A passion for the natural is a strong foundation for\r\nhabits of health and a priceless possession for one who wishes to know\r\nmorality in its highest sense.\r\n\r\n\"Natural\" is less attractive to us than it would be had Agassiz first\r\ninterpreted it for us rather than Rousseau or present-day exponents of\r\n\"the simple life,\" \"back to nature,\" and \"back to the land.\" It is too\r\noften forgotten that no one sins against natural law more grievously\r\nthan the primitive man or the isolated man in daily contact with\r\nnon-human nature. Communing with nature seems not only to require\r\ncommuning with man but to give joys in proportion as the nature lover\r\nis concerned for the human society of which he is a part. Natural law\r\ndoes not become a moral principle until man is benefited or injured by\r\nman's use of nature's resources within and about him. Natural living\r\naccording to natural law must be something sounder, more beautiful, and\r\nmore progressive than can be read into or out of mountains, trees,\r\nbrooks, and sky, or primitive society.\r\n\r\nNatural law points to a Nature Fore as well as a Nature Back, to a\r\nNature Up and Beyond as well as a Nature Down and Behind. The Nature\r\nthat was yesterday will not do for to-morrow, any more than a man is\r\nwilling to give up his nature aspirations for the careless, animal ways\r\nof romping childhood. Civilization is constantly urged at each step to\r\nrepeat the prayer of Holmes's old man who dreams for the Autocrat of\r\nthe Breakfast Table:\r\n\r\n    Oh for one hour of youthful joy!\r\n      Give back my twentieth spring!\r\n    I'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy\r\n      Than reign a gray-beard king!\r\n\r\n    Off with the wrinkled spoils of age!\r\n      Away with learning's crown!\r\n    Tear out life's wisdom-written page,\r\n      And dash its trophies down!\r\n\r\n    One moment let my life blood stream\r\n      From boyhood's fount of flame!\r\n    Give me one giddy, reeling dream\r\n      Of life all love and fame!\r\n\r\nBut every experiment in turning back exalts the present and the future.\r\nGifts as well as problems are seen to come with complexity, and\r\ncivilization flatly refuses to relinquish these gifts. Sound maturity\r\nis better than youth or age:\r\n\r\n    The smiling angel dropped his pen,--\r\n      \"Why, this will never do;\r\n    The man would be a boy again,\r\n      And be a father too!\"\r\n\r\nProblems of health and of civics can never be solved by appealing to\r\nNature Back, when only the few could be healthy, when one baby in three\r\ndied in infancy, when old age was toothless and childish, when\r\ninfection ravished nations, when the average life was twenty years\r\nshorter than now, and when unspeakable filth was tolerated in air,\r\nstreet, and house. They can all be solved by appeals to Nature Fore,\r\nwhich holds up an ideal of mankind physically able to enjoy all the\r\nbenefits and to conquer all the dangers of civilization. It is not\r\nlooking back, but looking in and forward that reveals what natural law\r\npromises to those who obey it.\r\n\r\nBy using numerous tests which have been suggested in preceding chapters\r\nwe can learn how far we and our communities obey natural law when\r\nworking and playing. Health for health's sake has nowhere been urged.\r\nOn the contrary, healthful living has been frankly valued for its aid\r\nto efficient living by individual and by community; wherefore the\r\nemphasis upon others' health and upon the civic aspects of our own\r\nhealth. Tests furnish us with the technic necessary to efficient\r\nliving; civics, with the larger reason; natural law, with the \"pillar\r\nof fire by night\" to help us choose our path among habits and pleasures\r\nwhose immediate results upon efficient living cannot easily be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nFashions, tastes, mannerisms, personal indulgences, have been left for\r\nAgassiz to deal with. Generally speaking, we all know of numerous acts\r\ncommitted and numerous acts omitted in our daily routine that convict\r\nus of not living up to our knowledge of physiology and hygiene,--wearing\r\ntight shoes or tight corsets, drinking strong coffee, smoking, reading\r\nwhile reclining, failing to insure clean air and clean bodies. Then\r\nthere are other acts whose omission or commission violate no physical\r\nlaw so far as we can see, but whose unnaturalness we concede,--putting\r\nchalk on the eyebrows, wearing false hair or curious puffs, putting\r\nperfumery in the bath or on handkerchiefs, assuming artificial poses of\r\nbody or mouth. These violations of natural law are forced upon us by\r\n\"style\" or \"custom\" or family convenience. When we come to choose\r\nbetween following fashions and disobeying them, we generally decide that\r\nit is better to do a foolish or slightly harmful thing than to occasion\r\ncriticism, mirth, or even special notice by our dress or our\r\nabstemiousness.\r\n\r\nLast night I went to a dinner party at eight. I ate and ate a great\r\nvariety of palatable foods that Nature Back never knew. After two hours\r\nof eating I imbibed for two hours the tobacco smoke of the gentlemen\r\nwho made up the party. I knew that eight o'clock was too late for me to\r\nbegin eating, that two hours was too long to eat, that the tobacco of\r\nothers was bad for my health and for to-day's efficiency. All this I\r\nknew when I accepted the invitation to dinner. I went with no intention\r\nof preventing others from smoking or of lecturing my host or his chef\r\nor his guests for the unhygienic practices of our day. Yet the physical\r\nills were more than offset by certain definite gains to the school\r\nchildren of New York that will result from last night's meeting.\r\nNatural law was abated in part. But I declined certain dishes that\r\nwould not agree with me, helped myself sparingly of many dishes,\r\navoided tobacco and wines, and by a three-mile walk in the open air, a\r\nbath, and a good long night's sleep have almost recovered my right to\r\ntalk of the sacredness of natural law.\r\n\r\nNature Back says I should not have gone to this dinner. But I was\r\ncompelled to go. I know I am going to others. I cannot do my work\r\nunless I overdraw my current health account. Nature Fore tells me that\r\neffective cooeperation with others will frequently require me to eat at\r\nthe dinner hour of others, to retire at others' sleeping time, to wear\r\nwhat others will approve, to violate natural law. But Nature Fore also\r\ntells me how to build up a health reserve so that I can meet these\r\nemergencies without endangering my health credit.\r\n\r\nNature Back demands \"dress reform.\" Nature Fore tells me that I can\r\nmarch in step with my contemporaries without either attracting\r\nattention or discrediting and affronting natural law. Passion for the\r\nnatural has effected numerous reforms in dress, diet, and social\r\nhabits, until commerce provides a natural adaptation of practically\r\nevery fashion. With regard to few things is it necessary to-day for any\r\none who reads magazines to do violence to bodily health for fashion's\r\nsake. We may wear what we will, eat what we prefer, decline what is\r\nunnatural for us, without inviting censure. The debauches of those\r\nunfortunate people who live an unnatural, purposeless existence, affect\r\nsuch a small number that their laws need not be considered here.\r\nNatural law makes obedience to itself attractive; hence commerce is\r\nrapidly learning to cater to distaste for the unnatural. With few\r\nexceptions, only temporary concessions to unnatural living are required\r\nin order to dress and act conventionally.\r\n\r\nNature Back throws little light upon conditions necessary for modern\r\nlabor. It can do nothing but demand the abolition of the factory, the\r\nbig store, the tenement, the school. Nature Fore says we cannot abolish\r\nthe means of working out the highest forms of cooeperation. But we can\r\nmake them compatible with natural living. We can modify conditions so\r\nthat earning a livelihood will not compel workers to violate natural\r\nlaw at any or all times. The greatest need of factory and tenement\r\nreform is for parents and teachers to make a religion of Nature Fore\r\nand to instill its principles in the minds of children. Parents and\r\nteachers must live the natural before they can make children love the\r\nnatural.
