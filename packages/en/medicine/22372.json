Grenfell\r\nAll Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have long been resisting the strong pressure from friends that would\r\nforce me to risk having to live alongside my own autobiography. It\r\nseems still an open question whether it is advisable, or even whether\r\nit is right--seeing that it calls for confessions. In the eyes of God\r\nthe only alternative is a book of lies. Moreover, sitting down to\r\nwrite one's own life story has always loomed up before my imagination\r\nas an admission that one was passing the post which marks the last\r\nlap; and though it was a justly celebrated physician who told us that\r\nwe might profitably crawl upon the shelf at half a century, that added\r\nno attraction for me to the effort, when I passed that goal.\r\n\r\nThirty-two years spent in work for deep-sea fishermen, twenty-seven of\r\nwhich years have been passed in Labrador and northern Newfoundland,\r\nhave necessarily given me some experiences which may be helpful to\r\nothers. I feel that this alone justifies the writing of this story.\r\n\r\nTo the many helpers who have coöperated with me at one time or another\r\nthroughout these years, I owe a debt of gratitude which will never be\r\nforgotten, though it has been impossible to mention each one by name.\r\nWithout them this work could never have been.\r\n\r\nTo my wife, who was willing to leave all the best the civilized world\r\ncan offer to share my life on this lonely coast, I want to dedicate\r\nthis book. Truth forces me to own that it would never have come into\r\nbeing without her, and her greater share in the work of its production\r\ndeclares her courage to face the consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.

It affords a subject of conversation when you are asked\r\nto put your name in birthday books. It is evident that many people\r\nsuppose it to be almost an intrusion to appear on that day. However,\r\nit was perfectly satisfactory to me so long as it was not the 29th. As\r\na boy, that was all for which I cared. Still, I used at times to be\r\noppressed by the danger, so narrowly missed, of growing up with undue\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nThe event occurred in 1865 in Parkgate, near Chester, England, whither\r\nmy parents had moved to enable my father to take over the school of\r\nhis uncle. I was always told that what might be called boisterous\r\nweather signalled my arrival. Experience has since shown me that that\r\nneed not be considered a particularly ominous portent in the winter\r\nseason on the Sands of Dee.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that the selection of our birthplace is not left to\r\nourselves. It would most certainly be one of those small decisions\r\nwhich would later add to the things over which we worry. I can see how\r\nit would have acted in my own case. For my paternal forbears are\r\nreally of Cornish extraction--a corner of our little Island to which\r\nattaches all the romantic aroma of the men, who, in defence of\r\nEngland, \"swept the Spanish Main,\" and so long successfully singed the\r\nBang of Spain's beard, men whose exploits never fail to stir the best\r\nblood of Englishmen, and among whom my direct ancestors had the\r\nprivilege of playing no undistinguished part. On the other hand, my\r\nvisits thither have--romance aside--convinced me that the restricted\r\nforeshore and the precipitous cliffs are a handicap to the development\r\nof youth, compared with the broad expanses of tempting sands, which\r\nare after all associated with another kinsman, whose songs have helped\r\nto make them famous, Charles Kingsley.\r\n\r\nMy mother was born in India, her father being a colonel of many\r\ncampaigns, and her brother an engineer officer in charge during the\r\nsiege of Lucknow till relieved by Sir Henry Havelock. At the first\r\nDelhi Durbar no less than forty-eight of my cousins met, all being\r\nofficers either of the Indian military or civil service.\r\n\r\nTo the modern progressive mind the wide sands are a stumbling-block.\r\nSilting up with the years, they have closed the river to navigation,\r\nand converted our once famous Roman city of Chester into a sleepy,\r\nsecond-rate market-town. The great flood of commerce from the New\r\nWorld sweeps contemptuously past our estuary, and finds its\r\nclearing-house under the eternal, assertive smoke clouds which\r\ncamouflage the miles of throbbing docks and slums called\r\nLiverpool--little more than a dozen miles distant. But the\r\nheather-clad hills of Heswall, and the old red sandstone ridge, which\r\nform the ancient borough of the \"Hundred of Wirral,\" afford an\r\nefficient shelter from the insistent taint of out-of-the-worldness.\r\n\r\nEvery inch of the Sands of Dee were dear to me. I learned to know\r\ntheir every bank and gutter. Away beyond them there was a mystery in\r\nthe blue hills of the Welsh shore, only cut off from us children in\r\nreality by the narrow, rapid water of the channel we called the Deep.\r\nYet they seemed so high and so far away. The people there spoke a\r\ndifferent language from ours, and all their instincts seemed\r\ndiverse. Our humble neighbours lived by the seafaring genius which we\r\nourselves loved so much. They made their living from the fisheries of\r\nthe river mouth; and scores of times we children would slip away, and\r\nspend the day and night with them in their boats.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: VIEW FROM MOSTYN HOUSE, THE AUTHOR'S BIRTHPLACE,\r\n   PARKGATE, CHESHIRE]\r\n\r\nWhile I was still quite a small boy, a terrible blizzard struck the\r\nestuary while the boats were out, and for twenty-four hours one of the\r\nfishing craft was missing. Only a lad of sixteen was in charge of\r\nher--a boy whom we knew, and with whom we had often sailed. All my\r\nfamily were away from home at the time except myself; and I can still\r\nremember the thrill I experienced when, as representative of the \"Big\r\nHouse,\" I was taken to see the poor lad, who had been brought home at\r\nlast, frozen to death.\r\n\r\nThe men of the opposite shores were shopkeepers and miners. Somehow we\r\nknew that they couldn't help it. The nursery rhyme about \"Taffy was a\r\nWelshman; Taffy was a thief,\" because familiar, had not led us to hold\r\nany unduly inflated estimate of the Welsh character. One of my old\r\nnurses did much to redeem it, however. She had undertaken the burden\r\nof my brother and myself during a long vacation, and carried us off\r\nbodily to her home in Wales. Her clean little cottage stood by the\r\nside of a road leading to the village school of the State Mining\r\nDistrict of Festiniog. We soon learned that the local boys resented\r\nthe intrusion of the two English lads, and they so frequently chased\r\nus off the village green, which was the only playground offered us,\r\nthat we at last decided to give battle. We had stored up a pile of\r\nslates behind our garden wall, and luring the enemy to the gates by\r\nthe simple method of retiring before their advance, we saluted them\r\nwith artillery fire from a comparatively safe entrenchment. To my\r\nhorror, one of the first missiles struck a medium-sized boy right over\r\nthe eye, and I saw the blood flow instantly. The awful comparison of\r\nDavid and Goliath flashed across my terror-stricken mind, and I fled\r\nincontinently to my nurse's protection. Subsequently by her adroit\r\ndiplomacy, we were not only delivered from justice, but gained the\r\nfreedom of the green as well.\r\n\r\nFar away up the river came the great salt-water marshes which seemed\r\nso endless to our tiny selves. There was also the Great Cop, an\r\nembankment miles long, intended to reach \"from England to Wales,\" but\r\nwhich was never finished because the quicksand swallowed up all that\r\nthe workmen could pour into it. Many a time I have stood on the broken\r\nend, where the discouraged labourers had left their very shovels and\r\npicks and trucks and had apparently fled in dismay, as if convicted of\r\nthe impiousness of trying to fill the Bottomless Pit. To my childish\r\nimagination the upturned wheelbarrows and wasted trucks and rails\r\nalways suggested the banks of the Red Sea after the awful disaster had\r\nswept over Pharoah and his host. How the returning tide used to sweep\r\nthrough that to us fathomless gulch! It made the old river seem ever\r\nso much more wonderful, and ever so much more filled with adventure.\r\n\r\nMany a time, just to dare it, I would dive into the very cauldron, and\r\nlet the swirling current carry me to the grassy sward beyond--along\r\nwhich I would run till the narrowing channel permitted my crossing to\r\nthe Great Cop again. I would be drying myself in the sunshine as I\r\nwent, and all ready for my scanty garments when I reached my clothing\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nThen came the great days when the heavy nor'westers howled over the\r\nSands--our sea-front was exposed to all the power of the sea right\r\naway to the Point of Ayr--the days when they came in with big spring\r\ntides, when we saw the fishermen doubling their anchors, and carefully\r\noverhauling the holding gear of their boats, before the flooding tide\r\ndrove them ashore, powerless to do more than watch them battling at\r\ntheir moorings like living things--the possessions upon which their\r\nvery bread depended. And then this one would sink, and another would\r\npart her cable and come hurtling before the gale, until she crashed\r\nright into the great upright blocks of sandstone which, riveted with\r\niron bands to their copings, were relied upon to hold the main road\r\nfrom destruction. Sometimes in fragments, and sometimes almost entire,\r\nthe craft would be slung clean over the torturing battlements, and be\r\nleft stranded high and dry on our one village street, a menace to\r\ntraffic, but a huge joy to us children.\r\n\r\nThe fascination of the Sands was greatly enhanced by the numerous\r\nbirds which at all times frequented them, in search of the abundant\r\nfood which lay buried along the edges of the muddy gutters. There were\r\nthousands of sandpipers in enormous flocks, mixed with king plovers,\r\ndunlins, and turnstones, which followed the ebb tides, and returned\r\nagain in whirling clouds before the oncoming floods. Black-and-white\r\noyster-catchers were always to be found chattering over the great\r\nmussel patches at low water. With their reddish bills, what a trophy a\r\nbunch of them made as we bore them proudly home over our shoulders!\r\nThen there were the big long-billed curlews. What a triumph when one\r\noutwitted them! One of my clearest recollections is discovering a\r\nplace to which they were flighting at night by the water's edge; how,\r\nhaving no dog, I swam out for bird after bird as they fell to my\r\ngun--shooting some before I had even time to put on my shirt again;\r\nand my consequent blue-black shoulder, which had to be carefully\r\nhidden next day. There were wild ducks, too, to be surprised in the\r\npools of the big salt marshes.\r\n\r\nFrom daylight to dark I would wander, quite alone, over endless miles,\r\nentirely satisfied to come back with a single bird, and not in the\r\nleast disheartened if I got none. All sense of time used to be lost,\r\nand often enough the sandwich and biscuit for lunch forgotten, so that\r\nI would be forced occasionally to resort to a solitary public house\r\nnear a colliery on our side of the water, for \"tea-biscuits,\" all that\r\nthey offered, except endless beer for the miners. I can even remember,\r\nwhen very hard driven, crossing to the Welsh side for bread and\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThese expeditions were made barefoot as long as the cold was not too\r\ngreat. A diary that I assayed to keep in my eighth year reminds me\r\nthat on my birthday, five miles from home in the marshes, I fell head\r\nover heels into a deep hole, while wading out, gun in hand, after some\r\noyster-catchers which I had shot. The snow was still deep on the\r\ncountryside, and the long trot home has never been quite forgotten. My\r\ngrief, however, was all for the gun. There was always the joy of\r\nventure in those dear old Sands. The channels cut in them by the\r\nflowing tides ran deep, and often intersected. Moreover, they changed\r\nwith the varying storms. The rapidly rising tide, which sent a bore up\r\nthe main channel as far as Chester, twelve miles above us, filled\r\nfirst of all these treacherous waterways, quite silently, and often\r\nunobserved. To us, taught to be as much at home in the water as on the\r\nland, they only added spice to our wanderings. They were nowhere very\r\nwide, so by keeping one's head, and being able to swim, only our\r\nclothes suffered by it, and they, being built for that purpose, did\r\nnot complain.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, I remember great excitement. The tide had risen\r\nrapidly in the channel along the parade front, and the shrimp\r\nfishermen, who used push-nets in the channels at low tide, had\r\nreturned without noticing that one of their number was missing. Word\r\ngot about just too late, and already there was half a mile of water,\r\nbeyond which, through our telescopes, we could see the poor fellow\r\nmaking frantic signals to the shore. There was no boat out there, and\r\na big bank intervening, there seemed no way to get to him. Watching\r\nthrough our glasses, we saw him drive the long handle of his net deep\r\ninto the sand, and cling to it, while the tide rose speedily around\r\nhim. Meanwhile a whole bevy of his mates had rowed out to the bank,\r\nand were literally carrying over its treacherous surface one of their\r\nclumsy and heavy fishing punts. It was a veritable race for life; and\r\nnever have I watched one with keener excitement. We actually saw his\r\npost give way, and wash downstream with him clinging to it, just\r\nbefore his friends got near. Fortunately, drifting with the spar, he\r\nagain found bottom, and was eventually rescued, half full of salt\r\nwater. I remember how he fell in my estimation as a seaman--though I\r\nwas only a boy at the time.\r\n\r\nThere were four of us boys in all, of whom I was the second. My next\r\nbrother Maurice died when he was only seven, and the fourth, Cecil,\r\nbeing five years younger than I, left my brother Algernon and myself\r\nas the only real companions for each other. Moreover, an untoward\r\naccident, of which I was the unwitting cause, left my younger brother\r\nunable to share our play for many years. Having no sisters, and\r\nscarcely any boy friends, in the holidays, when all the boys in the\r\nschool went home, it might be supposed that my elder brother and I\r\nwere much thrown together. But as a matter of fact such was not the\r\ncase, for our temperaments being entirely different, and neither of us\r\nhaving any idea of giving way to the other, we seldom or ever found\r\nour pleasures together. And yet most of the worst scrapes into which\r\nwe fell were coöperative affairs. Though I am only anxious to shoulder\r\nmy share of the responsibility in the escapades, as well as in every\r\nother line of life, my brother Algernon possessed any genius to which\r\nthe family could lay claim, in that as in every other line. He was my\r\nfather over again, while I was a second edition of my mother. Father\r\nwas waiting to get into the sixth form at Rugby when he was only\r\nthirteen years old. He was a brilliant scholar at Balliol, but had\r\nbeen compelled to give up study and leave the University temporarily\r\nowing to brain trouble. He never published anything, but would reel\r\noff brilliant short poems or essays for friends at a moment's notice.\r\nI used always to remark that in whatever company he was, he was always\r\ndeferred to as an authority in anything approaching classics. He could\r\nread and quote Greek and Latin like English, spoke German and French\r\nfluently, while he was an excellent geologist, and Fellow of the\r\nGeographical Society. Here is quite a pretty little effusion of his\r\nwritten at eight years of age:\r\n\r\n      O, Glorious Sun, in thy palace of light,\r\n      To behold thee methinks is a beautiful sight.\r\n      O, Glorious Sun, come out of thy cloud,\r\n      No longer thy brightness in darkness shroud.\r\n      Let thy glorious beams like a golden Flood\r\n      Pour over the hills and the valleys and wood.\r\n      See! Mountains of light around him rise,\r\n      While he in a golden ocean lies:\r\n      O, Glorious Sun, in thy Palace of Light\r\n      To behold thee methinks is a beautiful sight.\r\n\r\n    Algernon Sydney Grenfell\r\n      Aged eight years\r\n\r\nSome of my brother's poems and hymns have been published in the school\r\nmagazine, or printed privately; but he, too, has only published a\r\nSpanish grammar, a Greek lexicon, and a few articles in the papers.\r\nWhile at Oxford he ran daily, with some friends, during one \"eights\r\nweek\" a cynical comic paper called \"The Rattle,\" to boost some\r\ntheories he held, and which he wished to enforce, and also to \"score\"\r\na few of the dons to whom he objected. This would have resulted in his\r\nbeing asked to retire for a season from the seat of learning at the\r\nrequest of his enemies, had not our beloved provost routed the special\r\ncause of the whole trouble, who was himself contributing to a London\r\nsociety paper, by replying that it was not to be wondered at if the\r\nscurrilous rags of London found an echo in Oxford. Moreover, a set of\r\n\"The Rattle\" was ordered to be bound and placed in the college\r\narchives, where it may still be seen.\r\n\r\nMy father having a very great deal of responsibility and worry during\r\nthe long school terms, as he was not only head master, but owned the\r\nschool as well, which he had purchased from his great-uncle, used to\r\nleave almost the day the holidays began and travel abroad with my\r\nmother. This partly accounts for the very unusual latitude allowed to\r\nus boys in coming and going from the house--no one being anxious if\r\nnow and again we did not return at night. The school matron was left\r\nin charge of the vast empty barracks, and we had the run of\r\nplay-field, gymnasium, and everything else we wanted. To outwit the\r\nmatron was always considered fair play by us boys, and on many\r\noccasions we were more than successful.\r\n\r\nOne time, when we had been acquiring some new lines of thought from\r\nsome trashy boys' books of the period, we became fired with the desire\r\nto enjoy the ruling passion of the professional burglar. Though never\r\nkept short of anything, we decided that one night we would raid the\r\nlarge school storeroom while the matron slept. As always, the planning\r\nwas entrusted to my brother. It was, of course, a perfectly easy\r\naffair, but we played the whole game \"according to Cavendish.\" We let\r\nourselves out of the window at midnight, glued brown paper to the\r\nwindow panes, cut out the putty, forced the catch, and stole sugar,\r\ncurrants, biscuits, and I am ashamed to say port wine--which we mulled\r\nin a tin can over the renovated fire in the matron's own sanctum. In\r\nthe morning the remainder was turned over to fishermen friends who\r\nwere passing along shore on their way to catch the early tide.\r\n\r\nI had no share in two other of my brother's famous escapades, though\r\nat the time it was a source of keen regret, for we were sent to\r\ndifferent public schools, as being, I suppose, incompatible. But we\r\nheard with pride how he had extracted phosphorus from the chemical\r\nlaboratory and while drawing luminous ghosts on the wall for the\r\nbenefit of the timorous, had set fire to the large dormitory and the\r\nboys' underclothing neatly laid out on the beds, besides burning\r\nhimself badly. Later he pleaded guilty to beeswaxing the seat of the\r\nboys in front of him in chapel, much to the detriment of their\r\ntrousers and the destruction of the dignity of Sunday worship.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that my parents were away we never found a moment in\r\nwhich to be lonely, but on one occasion it occurred to us that the\r\ncompany of some friends would add to our enjoyment. Why we waited till\r\nmy father and mother departed I do not know, but I recall that\r\nimmediately they had gone we spent a much-valued sixpence in\r\ntelegraphing to a cousin in London to come down to us for the\r\nholidays. Our message read: \"Dear Sid. Come down and stay the\r\nholidays. Father has gone to Aix.\" We were somewhat chagrined to\r\nreceive the following day an answer, also by wire: \"Not gone yet.\r\nFather.\" It appeared that my father and mother had stayed the night in\r\nLondon in the very house to which we had wired, and Sid. having to ask\r\nhis father's permission in order to get his railway fare, our uncle\r\nhad shown the invitation to my father. It was characteristic of my\r\nparents that Sid. came duly along, but they could not keep from\r\nsharing the joke with my uncle.\r\n\r\nDuring term-time some of our grown-up relatives would occasionally\r\nvisit us. But alas, it was only their idiosyncrasies which used to\r\nmake any impression upon us. One, a great-uncle, and a very\r\ndistinguished person, being Professor of Political Economy at Oxford,\r\nand a great friend of the famous Dr. Jowett, the chancellor, was the\r\nonly man we knew who ever, at any time, stood up long to my father in\r\nargument. It was only on rare occasions that we ever witnessed such a\r\ncontest, but I shall never forget one which took place in the evening\r\nin our drawing-room. My great-uncle was a small man, rather stout and\r\npink, and almost bald-headed. He got so absorbed in his arguments,\r\nwhich he always delivered walking up and down, that on this occasion,\r\ncoming to an old-fashioned sofa, he stepped right up onto the seat,\r\nclimbed over the back, and went on all the time with his remarks, as\r\nif only punctuating them thereby.\r\n\r\nWhether some of our pranks were suggested by those of which we heard,\r\nI do not remember. One of my father's yarns, however, always stuck in\r\nmy memory. For once, being in a very good humour, he told us how when\r\nsome distinguished old lady had come to call on his father--a house\r\nmaster with Arnold at Rugby--he had been especially warned not to\r\ninterrupt this important person, who had come to see about her son's\r\nentering my grandfather's \"House.\" It so happened that quite\r\nunconsciously the lady in question had seated herself on an old\r\ncane-bottomed armchair in which father had been playing, thus\r\ndepriving him temporarily of a toy with which he desired to amuse\r\nhimself. He never, even in later life, was noted for undue patience,\r\nand after endeavouring in vain to await her departure, he somehow\r\nsecured a long pin. With this he crawled from behind under the seat,\r\nand by discreetly probing upwards, succeeded suddenly in dislodging\r\nhis enemy.\r\n\r\nOur devotions on Sunday were carried out in the parish church of the\r\nvillage of Neston, there being no place of worship of the Established\r\nChurch in our little village. In term-time we were obliged to go\r\nmorning and evening to the long services, which never made any\r\nconcessions to youthful capacities. So in holiday-time, though it was\r\nessential that we should go in the morning to represent the house, we\r\nwere permitted to stay home in the evening. But even the mornings were\r\na time of great weariness, and oft-recurrent sermons on the terrible\r\nfate which awaited those who never went to church, and the still more\r\nuntoward end which was in store for frequenters of dissenting\r\nmeeting-houses, failed to awaken in us the respect due to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOn the way to church we had generally to pass by those who dared even\r\nthe awful fate of the latter. It was our idea that to tantalize us\r\nthey wore especially gorgeous apparel while we had to wear black Etons\r\nand a top hat--which, by the way, greatly annoyed us. One waistcoat\r\nespecially excited our animosity, and from it we conceived the title\r\n\"specklebelly,\" by which we ever afterwards designated the whole\r\n\"genus nonconformist.\" The entrance to the chapel (ours was the\r\nChurch!) was through a door in a high wall, over which we could not\r\nsee; and my youthful brain used to conjure up unrighteous and strange\r\norgies which we felt must take place in those precincts which we were\r\nnever permitted to enter. Our Sunday Scripture lessons had grounded us\r\nvery familiarly with the perverse habits of that section of the Chosen\r\nPeople who _would_ serve Baal and Moloch, when it obviously paid so\r\nmuch better not to do so. But although we counted the numbers which we\r\nsaw going in, and sometimes met them coming out, they seemed never to\r\nlessen perceptibly. On this account our minds, with the merciless\r\nlogic of childhood, gradually discounted the threatened calamities.\r\n\r\nThis must have accounted for the lapse in our own conduct, and a sort\r\nof comfortable satisfaction that the Almighty contented Himself in\r\nmerely counting noses in the pews. For even though it was my brother\r\nwho got into trouble, I shall never forget the harangue on impiety\r\nthat awaited us when a most unchristian sexton reported to our father\r\nthat the pew in front of ours had been found chalked on the back, so\r\nas to make its occupants the object of undisguised attention from the\r\nrest of the congregation. As circumstantial evidence also against us,\r\nhe offered some tell-tale squares of silver paper, on which we had\r\nbeen cooking chocolates on the steam pipes during the sermon.\r\n\r\nIn all my childhood I can only remember one single punishment, among\r\nnot a few which I received, which I resented--and for years I never\r\nquite forgot it. Some one had robbed a very favourite apple tree in\r\nour orchard--an escapade of which I was perfectly capable, but in this\r\ninstance had not had the satisfaction of sharing. Some evidence had\r\nbeen lodged against me, of which I was not informed, and I therefore\r\nhad no opportunity to challenge it. I was asked before a whole class\r\nof my schoolmates if I had committed the act, and at once denied it.\r\nWithout any hearing I was adjudged guilty, and promptly subjected to\r\nthe punishment of the day--a good birching. On every occasion on which\r\nwe were offered the alternative of detention, we invariably \"plumped\"\r\nfor the rod, and got it over quickly, and, as we considered,\r\ncreditably--taking it smiling as long as we could. But that one act of\r\ninjustice, the disgrace which it carried of making me a liar before my\r\nfriends, seared my very soul. I vowed I would get even whatever it\r\ncost, and I regret to say that I hadn't long to wait the opportunity.\r\nFor I scored both the apples and the lie against the punishment before\r\nmany months. Nor was I satisfied then. It rankled in my mind both by\r\nday and by night; and it taught me an invaluable lesson--never to\r\nsuspect or condemn rashly. It was one of Dr. Arnold's boys at Rugby, I\r\nbelieve, who summed up his master's character by saying, \"The head was\r\na beast, but he was always a just beast.\"\r\n\r\nAt fourteen years of age my brother was sent to Repton, to the house\r\nof an uncle by marriage--an arrangement which has persuaded me never\r\nto send boys to their relatives for training. My brother's pranks were\r\nundoubtedly many, but they were all boyish and legitimate ones. After\r\na time, however, he was removed at his own request, and sent to\r\nClifton, where he was head of the school, and the school house also,\r\nunder Dr. Percival, the late Bishop of Hereford. From there he took an\r\nopen scholarship for Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt was most wisely decided to send us to separate schools, and\r\ntherefore at fourteen I found myself at Marlborough--a school of\r\nnearly six hundred resident boys, on entering which I had won a\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSCHOOL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nMarlborough \"College,\" as we say in England for a large University\r\npreparatory school, is situated in Wiltshire, in a perfectly beautiful\r\ncountry, close to the Savernake Forest--one of the finest in all\r\nEngland. As everything and everybody was strange to me on my arrival,\r\nhad I been brought up to be less self-reliant the events of my first\r\nday or two would probably have impressed themselves more deeply on my\r\nmemory than is the case. Some Good Samaritan, hearing that I was bound\r\nfor a certain house, allowed me to follow him from the station to the\r\ninn--for a veritable old inn it was. It was one of those lovely old\r\nwayside hostels along the main road to the west, which, with the\r\ndecline of coaching days, found its way into the market, and had\r\nfallen to the hammer for the education of youth. Exactly how the\r\nadaptation had been accomplished I never quite understood. The\r\nbuilding formed the end of a long avenue of trees and was approached\r\nthrough high gates from the main road. It was flanked on the east side\r\nby other houses, which fitted in somewhat inharmoniously, but served\r\nas school-rooms, dining-hall, chapel, racquets and fives courts,\r\nstudies, and other dwelling-houses. The whole was entirely enclosed so\r\nthat no one could pass in or out, after the gates were shut, without\r\nringing up the porter from his lodge, and having one's name taken as\r\nbeing out after hours. At least it was supposed that no one could,\r\nthough we boys soon found that there were more ways than one leading\r\nto Rome.\r\n\r\nThe separate dwelling-houses were named A, B, and C. I was detailed\r\nto C House, the old inn itself. Each house was again divided into\r\nthree, with its own house master, and its own special colour and\r\nbadges. Our three were at the time \"Sharps,\" \"Upcutts,\" and \"Bakers.\"\r\nOur particular one occupied the second floor, and was reached by great\r\noak staircases, which, if you were smart, you could ascend at about\r\nsix steps at a time. This was often a singular desideratum, because\r\nuntil you reached the fifth form, according to law you ascended by the\r\nless direct back stairway.\r\n\r\nOur colours were white and maroon, and our sign a bishop's\r\nmitre--which effigy I still find scribbled all over the few book\r\nrelics which I have retained, and which emblem, when borne\r\nsubsequently on my velvet football cap, proved to be the nearest I\r\never was to approach to that dignified insignia.\r\n\r\nMy benefactor, on the night of my arrival, having done more for me\r\nthan a new boy could expect of an old one, was whirled off in the\r\nstream of his returning chums long before I had found my resting-place\r\nfor the night. The dormitory to which I at last found myself assigned\r\ncontained no less than twenty-five beds, and seemed to me a veritable\r\nwilderness. If the coaches which used to stop here could have ascended\r\nthe stairs, it might have accommodated several. What useful purpose it\r\ncould have served in those far-off days I never succeeded in deciding.\r\nThe room most nearly like it which I can recall is the old dining-hall\r\nof a great manor, into which the knights in armour rode on horseback\r\nto meals, that being far less trouble than removing one's armour, and\r\nquite as picturesque. More or less amicably I obtained possession of a\r\nbed in a good location, under a big window which looked out over the\r\nbeautiful gardens below. I cannot remember that I experienced any of\r\nthose heart-searchings or forebodings which sentiment deplores as the\r\ninevitable lot of the unprotected innocent.\r\n\r\nOne informal battle during the first week with a boy possessed of the\r\nsanctity of having come up from the lower school, and therefore being\r\nan \"old boy,\" achieved for me more privileges than the actual decision\r\nperhaps entitled one to enjoy, namely, being left alone. I\r\nsubsequently became known as the \"Beast,\" owing to my belligerent\r\nnature and the undue copiousness of my hair.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I was placed in the upper fourth form condemned me to do\r\nmy \"prep\" in the intolerable barrack called \"Big School\"--a veritable\r\nbear-garden to which about three hundred small boys were relegated to\r\nstudy. Order was kept by a master and a few monitors, who wandered to\r\nand fro from end to end of the building, while we were supposed to\r\nwork. For my part, I never tried it, partly because the work came very\r\neasy to me, while the \"repetition\" was more readily learned from a\r\nloose page at odd times like dinner and chapel, and partly because,\r\nwinning a scholarship during the term, I was transferred to a building\r\nreserved for twenty-eight such privileged individuals until they\r\ngained the further distinction of a place in the house class-room, by\r\ngetting their transfer into the fifth form.\r\n\r\nBesides those who lived in the big quad there were several houses\r\noutside the gates, known as \"Out-Houses.\" The boys there fared a good\r\ndeal better than we who lived in college, and I presume paid more\r\nhighly for it. Our meals were served in \"Big Hall,\" where the whole\r\nfour hundred of us were fed. The meals were exceptionally poor; so\r\nmuch so that we boys at the beginning of term formed what we called\r\nbrewing companies--which provided as far as possible breakfasts and\r\nsuppers for ourselves all term. As a protection against early\r\nbankruptcy, it was our custom to deposit our money with a rotund but\r\npopular school official, known always by a corruption of his name as\r\n\"the Slug.\" Every Saturday night he would dole out to you your deposit\r\nmade on return from the holidays, divided into equal portions by the\r\nnumber of weeks in the term. Once one was in the fifth form, brewing\r\nbecame easy, for one had a right to a place on the class-room fire for\r\none's kettle or saucepan. Till then the space over gas stoves in Big\r\nSchool being strictly limited, the right was only acquired \"vi et\r\narmis.\" Moreover, most of the fourth form boys and the \"Shells,\" a\r\nclass between them and the fifth, if they had to work after evening\r\nchapel, had to sit behind desks around the house class-room facing the\r\ncentre, in which as a rule the fifth form boys were lazily cooking and\r\ndevouring their suppers. Certain parts of those repasts, like\r\nsausages, we would import ready cooked from the \"Tuck Shop,\" and hence\r\nthey only needed warming up. Breakfast in Big School was no comfort to\r\none, and personally I seldom attended it. But at dinner and tea one\r\nhad to appear, and remain till the doors were opened again. It was a\r\nkind of roll-call; and the penalty for being late was fifty lines to\r\nbe written out. As my own habits were never as regular as they should\r\nhave been, whenever I was able to keep ahead, I possessed pages of\r\nsuch lines, neatly written out during school hours and ready for\r\nemergencies. On other occasions I somewhat shamefacedly recall that I\r\nemployed other boys, who devoted less time to athletics than was my\r\nwont, to help me out--their only remuneration being the \"joy of\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nThe great desire of every boy who could hope to do so was to excel in\r\nathletics. This fact has much to commend it in such an educational\r\nsystem, for it undoubtedly kept its devotees from innumerable worse\r\ntroubles and dangers. All athletics were compulsory, unless one had\r\nobtained permanent exemption from the medical officer. If one was not\r\nchosen to play on any team during the afternoon, each boy had to go to\r\ngymnasium for drill and exercises, or to \"flannel\" and run round the\r\nAylesbury Arms, an old public house three quarters of a mile distant.\r\nAny breach of this law was severely punished by the boys themselves.\r\nIt involved a \"fives batting,\" that is, a \"birching\" carried out with\r\na hardwood fives bat, after chapel in the presence of the house. As a\r\nbreach of patriotism, it carried great disgrace with it, and was very,\r\nvery seldom necessary.\r\n\r\nExperience would make me a firm believer in\r\nself-government--determination is the popular term now, I believe. No\r\npunishments ever touched the boys one tenth part as much as those\r\nadministered by themselves. On one occasion two of the Big School\r\nmonitors, who were themselves notorious far more for their constant\r\nbreaches of school law than for their observance of it, decided to\r\nmake capital at the expense of the sixth form. One day, just as the\r\ndinner-bell rang, they locked the sixth form door, while a conclave\r\nwas being held inside. Though everyone was intended to know to whom\r\nthe credit belonged, it was understood that no one would dream of\r\ngiving evidence against them. But it so happened that their voices had\r\nbeen recognized from within by one of the sixth form boys--and\r\n\"bullies\" and unpopular though the culprits were, they wouldn't deny\r\ntheir guilt. Their condign punishment was to be \"fives-batted\"\r\npublicly in Big School--in which, however, they regained very\r\nconsiderable popularity by the way they took a \"spanking\" without\r\nturning a hair, though it cost no less than a dozen bats before it\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThe publicity of Big School was the only redemption of such a\r\nbear-garden, but that was a good feature. It served to make us toe the\r\nline. After tea, it was the custom to have what we called \"Upper\r\nSchool Boxing.\" A big ring was formed, boxing-gloves provided, and any\r\ndifferences which one might have to settle could be arranged there.\r\nThere was more energy than science about the few occasions on which I\r\nappeared personally in the ring, but it was an excellent safety-valve\r\nand quite an evolutionary experience.\r\n\r\nThe exigency of having to play our games immediately after noon dinner\r\nhad naturally taught the boys at the head of athletic affairs that it\r\nwas not wise to eat too much. Dinner was the one solid meal which the\r\ncollege provided, and most of us wanted it badly enough when it came\r\nalong, especially the suet puddings which went by the name of\r\n\"bollies\" and were particularly satisfying. But whenever any game of\r\nimportance was scheduled, a remorseless card used to be passed round\r\nthe table just after the meat stage, bearing the ominous legend \"No\r\nbolly to-day.\" To make sure that there were no truants, all hands were\r\nforced to \"Hooverize.\" Oddly enough, beer in large blue china jugs was\r\nfreely served at every dinner. We called it \"swipes,\" and boys,\r\nhowever small, helped themselves to as much as they liked. Moreover,\r\nas soon as the game was over, all who had their house colours might\r\ncome in and get \"swipes\" served to them freely through the buttery\r\nwindow. Both practices, I believe, have long since fortunately fallen\r\ninto desuetude.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the budding athlete there was an excellent custom of\r\nclassifying not only the players who attained the first team; but\r\nbeyond them there were \"the Forty\" who wore velvet caps with tassels,\r\n\"the Sixty\" who wore velvet caps with silver braid, \"the Eighty,\" and\r\neven \"the Hundred\"--all of whom were posted from time to time, and so\r\nstimulated their members to try for the next grade.\r\n\r\nLike every other school there were bounds beyond which one might not\r\ngo, and therefore beyond which one always wanted to go. Compulsory\r\ngames limited the temptation in that direction very considerably; and\r\nmy own breaches were practically always to get an extra swim. We had\r\nan excellent open-air swimming pool, made out of a branch of the river\r\nKenneth, and were allowed one bathe a day, besides the dip before\r\nmorning chapel, which only the few took, and which did not count as a\r\nbathe. The punishment for breaking the rule was severe, involving a\r\nweek off for a first offence. But one was not easily caught, for even\r\na sixth-former found hundreds of naked boys very much alike in the\r\nwater, and the fact of any one having transgressed the limit was very\r\nhard to detect. Nor were we bound to incriminate ourselves by replying\r\nto leading questions.\r\n\r\n\"Late for Gates\" was a more serious crime, involving detention from\r\nbeloved games--and many were the expedients to which we resorted to\r\navoid such an untoward contingency. I remember well waiting for an\r\nhour outside the porter's view, hoping for some delivery wagon to give\r\nme a chance to get inside. For it was far too light to venture to\r\nclimb the lofty railings before \"prep\" time. Good fortune ordained,\r\nhowever, that a four-wheel cab should come along in time, containing\r\nthe parents of a \"hopeful\" in the sick-room. It seemed a desperate\r\nventure, for to \"run\" the gate was a worse offence than being late and\r\nowning up. But we succeeded by standing on the off step, unquestioned\r\nby the person inside, who guessed at once what the trouble was, and\r\nwho proved to be sport enough to engage the porter while we got clear.\r\nLater on a scapegrace who had more reason to require some by-way than\r\nmyself, revealed to me a way which involved a long détour and a climb\r\nover the laundry roof. Of this, on another occasion, I was sincerely\r\nglad to avail myself. One of the older boys, I remember, made a much\r\nbolder venture. He waited till dusk, and then boldly walked in through\r\nthe masters' garden. As luck would have it, he met our form master,\r\nwhom we will call Jones, walking the other way. It so happened he\r\npossessed a voice which he knew was much like that of another master,\r\nso simply sprinting a little he called out, \"Night, night, Jones,\" and\r\ngot by without discovery.\r\n\r\nOur chapel in those days was not a thing of beauty; but since then it\r\nhas been rebuilt (out of our stomachs, the boys used to say) and is a\r\nmodel work of art. Attendance at chapel was compulsory, and no \"cuts\"\r\nwere allowed. Moreover, once late, you were given lines, besides\r\nlosing your chapel half-holiday. So the extraordinary zeal exhibited\r\nto be marked off as present should not be attributed to religious\r\nfervour. The chapel was entered from quad by two iron gates, with the\r\nsame lofty railings which guarded the entrance on each side. The bell\r\ntolled for five minutes, then was silent one minute, and then a single\r\ntoll was given, called \"stroke.\" At that instant the two masters who\r\nstood by the pillars guarding each gate, jumped across, closing the\r\ngates if they could, and every one outside was late. Those inside the\r\nopen walk--the length of the chapel that led to the doors at the far\r\nend--then continued to march in.\r\n\r\nDuring prayers each form master sat opposite his form, all of which\r\nfaced the central aisle, and marked off those present. Almost every\r\nmorning half-dressed boys, with shirts open and collars unbuttoned,\r\nboots unlaced, and jumping into coats and waistcoats as they dashed\r\nalong, could be seen rushing towards the gate during the ominous\r\nminute of silence. There was always time to get straight before the\r\nmass of boys inside had emptied into chapel; and I never remember a\r\ngate master stopping a boy before \"stroke\" for insufficiency of\r\ncoverings. Many were the subterfuges employed to get excused, and\r\nnaturally some form masters were themselves less regular than others,\r\nthough you never could absolutely count on any particular one being\r\nabsent. Twice in my time gates were rushed--that is, when \"stroke\"\r\nwent such crowds of flying boys were just at the gate that the masters\r\nwere unable to stop the onslaught, and were themselves brushed aside\r\nor knocked down under the seething mass of panic-stricken would-be\r\nworshippers. On one of these occasions we were forgiven--\"stroke\" was\r\nten seconds early; on the other a half-holiday was stopped, as one of\r\nthe masters had been injured. To trip one's self up, and get a bloody\r\nnose, and possibly a face scratched on the gravel, and then a \"sick\r\ncut\" from the kindly old school doctor, was one of the more common\r\nways boys discovered of saving their chapel half--when it was a very\r\nclose call.\r\n\r\nThe school surgery was presided over in my day by a much-beloved old\r\nphysician of the old school, named Fergus, which the boys had so long\r\nago corrupted into \"Fungi\" that many a lad was caught mistakenly\r\naddressing the old gentleman as Dr. Fungi--an error I always fancied\r\nto be rather appreciated.\r\n\r\nBy going to surgery you could very frequently escape evening chapel--a\r\nvery desirable event if you had a \"big brew\" coming off in class-room,\r\nfor you could get things cooked and have plenty of room on the fire\r\nbefore the others were out. But one always had to pay for the\r\nadvantage, the old doctor being very much addicted to potions. I never\r\nshall forget the horrible tap in the corner, out of which \"cough\r\nmixture\" flowed as \"a healing for the nations,\" but which, nasty as it\r\nwas, was the cheapest price at which one could purchase the cut. Some\r\nboys, anxious to cut lessons, found that by putting a little soap in\r\none's eye, that organ would become red and watery. This they practised\r\nso successfully that sometimes for weeks they would be forbidden to do\r\nlessons on account of \"eye-strain.\" They had to use lotions,\r\neye-shades, and every spectacle possible was tried, but all to no\r\navail. Sometimes they used so much soap that I was sure the doctor\r\nwould suspect the bubbles.\r\n\r\nI had two periods in sick-room with a worrying cough, where the time\r\nwas always made so pleasant that one was not tempted to hasten\r\nrecovery. Diagnosis, moreover, was not so accurate in those days as it\r\nmight have been, and the dear old doctor took no risks. So at the age\r\nof sixteen I was sent off for a winter to the South of France, with\r\nthe diagnosis of congestion of the lungs.\r\n\r\nOne of my aunts, a Miss Hutchinson, living at Hyères in the South of\r\nFrance, was delighted to receive me. With a widowed friend and two\r\ncharming and athletic daughters, she had a very pretty villa on the\r\nhills overlooking the sea. My orders--to live out of doors--were very\r\nliterally obeyed. In light flannel costumes we roamed the hills after\r\nmoths and butterflies, early and late. We kept the frogs in miniature\r\nponds in boxes covered with netting, providing them with bamboo\r\nladders to climb, and so tell us when it was going to be wet weather.\r\nWe had also enclosures in which we kept banks of trap-door spiders,\r\nwhich used to afford us intense interest with their clever artifices.\r\nTo these we added the breeding of the more beautiful butterflies and\r\nmoths, and so, without knowing that we were learning, we were taught\r\nmany and valuable truths of life. There were horses to ride also, and\r\na beautiful \"plage\" to bathe upon. It was always sunny and warm, and I\r\ninvariably look back on that winter as spent in paradise. I was\r\npermitted to go over with a young friend to the Carnival at Nice,\r\nwhere, disguised as a clown, and then as a priest, with the _abandon_\r\nof boys, we enjoyed every moment of the time--the world was so big and\r\nwonderful. The French that I had very quickly learned, as we always\r\nspoke it at our villa, stood me on this occasion in good stead. But\r\nbetter still, I happened, when climbing into one of the\r\nflower-bedecked carriages parading in the \"bataille de fleurs\"--which,\r\nbeing in costume, was quite the right thing to do--to find that the\r\nowner was an old friend of my family, one Sir William Hut. He at once\r\ncarried me to his home for the rest of the Carnival, and, of course,\r\nmade it doubly enjoyable.\r\n\r\nA beautiful expedition, made later in that region which lives in my\r\nmemory, was to the gardens at La Mortola, over the Italian line, made\r\nfamous by the frequent visits of Queen Victoria to them. They were\r\nowned by Sir Thomas Hanbury, whose wife was my aunt's great friend.\r\n\r\nThe quaintness of the memories which persist longest in one's mind\r\noften amuse me. We used, as good Episcopalians, to go every Sunday to\r\nthe little English Church on the rue des Palmiers. Alas, I can\r\nremember only one thing about those services. The clergyman had a\r\npeculiar impediment in his speech which made him say his _h_'s and\r\n_s_'s, both as _sh_. Thus he always said _sh_uman for _h_uman, and\r\ninvariably prayed that God might be pleased to \"shave the Queen.\" He\r\nnearly got me into trouble once or twice through it.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the winter I realized that I had made a mistake.\r\nIn writing home I had so enthusiastically assured my father that the\r\nplace was suiting my health, that he wrote back that he thought in\r\nthat case I might stand a little tutoring, and forthwith I was\r\ndespatched every morning to a Mr. B., an Englishman, whose house,\r\ncalled the \"Hermitage,\" was in a thick wood. I soon discovered that\r\nMr. B. was obliged to live abroad for his health, and that the\r\ncoaching of small boys was only a means to that end. He was a good\r\ninstructor in mathematics, a study which I always loved, but he\r\ninsisted on my taking Latin and French literature, for neither of\r\nwhich I had the slightest taste. I consequently made no effort\r\nwhatever to improve my mind, a fact which did not in the least disturb\r\nhis equanimity. The great interest of those journeys to the Hermitage\r\nwere the fables of La Fontaine--which I learned as repetition and\r\nenjoyed--and the enormous number of lizards on the walls, which could\r\ndisappear with lightning rapidity when seen, though they would stay\r\nalmost motionless, waiting for a fly to come near, which they then\r\nswallowed alive. They were so like the stones one could almost rub\r\none's nose against them without seeing them. Each time I started, I\r\nused to cut a little switch for myself and try to switch them off\r\ntheir ledges before they vanished. The attraction to the act lay in\r\nthat it was almost impossible to accomplish. But if you did they\r\nscored a bull's-eye by incontinently discarding their tails, which\r\nmade them much harder to catch next time, and seemed in no way to\r\nincommode them, though it served to excuse my conscience of cruelty.\r\nAt the same time I have no wish to pose as a protector of flies.\r\n\r\nReturning to Marlborough School the following summer, I found that my\r\nfather, who knew perfectly the thorough groundwork I had received in\r\nGreek and Latin, had insisted on my being given a remove into the\r\nlower fifth form \"in absentia.\" Both he and I were aware that I could\r\ndo the work easily; but the form master resented it, and had already\r\nprotested in vain. I believe he was a very good man in his way, and\r\nmuch liked by those whom he liked. But alas, I was not one of them;\r\nand never once, during the whole time I was in his form, did I get one\r\nsingle word of encouragement out of him. My mathematical master, and\r\n\"stinks,\" or chemical master, I was very fond of, and in both those\r\ndepartments I made good progress.\r\n\r\nThe task of keeping order in a chemistry class of boys is never easy.\r\nThe necessary experiments divert the master's eye from the class, and\r\nalways give opportunity for fooling. Added to this was the fact that\r\nour \"stinks\" master, like many scientific teachers, was far too\r\ngood-natured, and half-enjoyed himself the diversion which his\r\nexperiments gave. When obliged to punish a boy caught \"flagrante\r\ndelicto,\" he invariably looked out for some way to make it up to him\r\nlater. It was the odd way he did it which endeared him to us, as if\r\napologizing for the kindness. Thus, on one occasion, suddenly in most\r\nrighteous anger, just as if a parenthesis to the remark he was making,\r\nhe interposed, \"Come and be caned, boy. My study, twelve o'clock.\"\r\nWhen the boy was leaving, very unrepentant after keeping the\r\nappointment, in the same parenthetical way the master remarked, \"Go\r\naway, boy. Cake and wine, my room, five o'clock\"--which proved\r\neventually the most effective part of the correction.\r\n\r\nTo children there always appears a gap between them and \"grown-ups\"\r\nas impassable as that which Abraham is made to describe as so great\r\nthat they who would pass to and fro cannot. As we grow older, we cease\r\nto see it, but it exists all the same. As I write, five children are\r\nromping through this old wood on broom-handle horses. One has just\r\nfallen. A girl of twelve at once retorts, \"Do get up, Willy, your\r\nhorse is always throwing you off.\" The joys of life lie in us, not in\r\nthings; and in childhood imagination is so big, its joys so entirely\r\nuncloyed. Sometimes grown-ups are apt to grudge the time and trouble\r\nput into apparently transient pleasures. A trivial strawberry feast,\r\ngiven to children on our dear old lawn under the jasmine and\r\nrose-bushes, something after the order of a New England clam-bake,\r\nstill looms as a happy memory of my parents' love for children,\r\npunctuated by the fact that though by continuing a game in spite of\r\nwarning I broke a window early in the afternoon, and was banished to\r\nthe nursery \"as advised,\" my father forgave me an hour later, and\r\nhimself fetched me down again to the party.\r\n\r\nTo teach us independence, my father put us on an allowance at a very\r\nearly age, with a small bank account, to which every birthday he added\r\nfive pounds on our behalf. We had no pony at that time, indeed had not\r\nyet learned to ride, so our deposits always went by the name of \"pony\r\nmoney.\" This was an excellent plan, for we didn't yet value money for\r\nitself, and were better able to appreciate the joy of giving because\r\nit seemed to postpone the advent of our pony. However, when we were\r\nthought to have learned to value so sentient a companion and to be\r\nlikely to treat him properly, a Good Samaritan was permitted to\r\npresent us with one of our most cherished friends. To us, she was an\r\nunparalleled beauty. How many times we fell over her head, and over\r\nher tail, no one can record. She always waited for you to remount, so\r\nit didn't much matter; and we were taught that great lesson in life,\r\nnot to be afraid of falling, but to learn how to take a fall. My own\r\nbent, however, was never for the things of the land, and though\r\ngallops on the Dee Sands, and races with our cousins, who owned a\r\nbroncho and generally beat us, had their fascination, boats were the\r\nthings which appealed most to me.\r\n\r\nHaving funds at our disposal, we were allowed to purchase material,\r\nand under the supervision of a local carpenter, to build a boat\r\nourselves. To this purpose our old back nursery was forthwith\r\nallocated. The craft which we desired was a canoe that would enable us\r\nto paddle or drift along the deep channels of the river, and allow us\r\nto steal upon the flocks of birds feeding at the edges. Often in\r\nmemory I enjoy those days again--the planning, the modelling, the\r\nfitting, the setting-up, and at last, the visit of inspection of our\r\nparents. Alas, stiff-necked in our generation, we had insisted on\r\nstraight lines and a square stern. Never shall I forget the\r\nindignation aroused in me by a cousin's remark, \"It looks awful like a\r\ncoffin.\" The resemblance had not previously struck either of us, and\r\nfather had felt that the joke was too dangerous a one to make, and had\r\nsaid nothing. But the pathos of it was that we now saw it all too\r\nclearly. My brother explained that the barque was intended to be not\r\n\"seen.\" Ugliness was almost desirable. It might help us if we called\r\nit the \"Reptile,\" and painted it red--all of which suggestions were\r\nfollowed. But still I remember feeling a little crestfallen, when\r\nafter launching it through the window, it lay offensively resplendent\r\nagainst the vivid green of the grass. It served, however, for a time,\r\nending its days honourably by capsizing a friend and me, guns and all,\r\ninto the half-frozen water of the lower estuary while we were\r\nstalking some curlew. I had to run home dripping. My friend's gun,\r\nmoreover, having been surreptitiously borrowed from my cousin's\r\nfather, was recovered the following day, to our unutterable relief.\r\nOut of the balance of the money spent on the boat, we purchased a\r\npin-fire, breech-loading gun, the pride of my life for many days. I\r\nwas being kept back from school at the time on account of a cold, but\r\nI was not surprised to find myself next day sitting in a train, bound\r\nfor Marlborough, and \"referred once more to my studies.\"\r\n\r\nA little later my father, not being satisfied, took me away to read\r\nwith a tutor for the London matriculation, in which without any\r\ntrouble, I received a first class.\r\n\r\nA large boarding-school in England is like a miniature world. One\r\nmakes many acquaintances, who change as one gets pushed into new\r\nclasses, so at that stage one makes few lasting friends. Those who\r\nremain till they attain the sixth form, and make the school teams,\r\nprobably form more permanent friendships. I at least think of that\r\nperiod as one when one's bristles were generally up, and though many\r\nhappy memories linger, and I have found that to be an old Marlburian\r\nis a bond of friendship all the world over, it is the little oddities\r\nwhich one remembers best.\r\n\r\nA new scholarship boy had one day been assigned to the closed\r\ncorporation of our particular class-room. To me he had many\r\nattractions, for he was a genius both in mathematics and chemistry. We\r\nused to love talking over the problems that were set us as voluntary\r\ntasks for our spare time; and our united excursions in those\r\ndirections were so successful that we earned our class more than one\r\n\"hour off,\" as rewards for the required number of stars given for good\r\npieces of work. My friend had, however, no use whatever for\r\nathletics. He had never been from home before, had no brothers, and\r\nfive sisters, was the pet of his parents, and naturally somewhat of a\r\nsquare plug in a round hole in our school life. He hated all\r\nconventions, and was always in trouble with the boys, for he entirely\r\nneglected his personal appearance, while his fingers were always\r\ndiscoloured with chemicals, and he would not even feign an interest in\r\nthe things for which they cared. I can remember him sitting on the\r\nfoot of my bed, talking me to sleep more than once with some new plan\r\nhe had devised for a self-steering torpedo or an absolutely reliable\r\nflying machine. He had received the sobriquet of \"Mad G.,\" and there\r\nwas some justice in it from the opposition point of view. I had not\r\nrealized, however, that he was being bullied--on such a subject he\r\nwould never say a syllable--till one day as he left class-room I saw a\r\nlarge lump of coal hit him square on the head, and a rush of blood\r\nfollow it that made me hustle him off to surgery. Scalp wounds are not\r\nso dangerous as they are bloody to heads as thick as ours. His\r\nexplanation that he had fallen down was too obvious a distortion of\r\ntruth to deceive even our kindly old doctor. But he asked no further\r\nquestion, seeing that it was a point of honour. The matter, however,\r\nforced an estrangement between myself and some of my fellows that I\r\nrealized afterwards was excellent for me. Forthwith we moved my\r\nfriend's desk into my corner of the room which was always safe when I\r\nwas around, though later some practices of the others to which I took\r\nexception led to a combination which I thought of then as that made by\r\nthe Jews to catch Paul, and which I foiled in a similar way,\r\nwatchfully eluding them when they were in numbers together, but always\r\nready to meet one or two at a time. The fact that I had just taken up\r\n\"racquets\" impressed it on my memory, for considering the class-room\r\ntemporarily unsafe for \"prep\" work, I used that building as a\r\nconvenient refuge for necessary study. It would have been far better\r\nto have fought it out and taken, if unavoidable, whatever came to\r\nme--had it been anywhere else I should probably have done so. But the\r\nclass-room was a close corporation for Foundation scholars, and not\r\none of my chums had access to it to see fair play.\r\n\r\nMy friendship for \"Mad G.\" was largely tempered by my own love for\r\nanything athletic, and eccentricities paid a very heavy price among\r\nall boys. Thus, though I was glad to lend my protection to my friend,\r\nwe never went about together--as such boys as he always lived the life\r\nof hermits in the midst of the crowd. I well remember one other boy,\r\nmade eccentric by his peculiar face and an unfortunate impediment of\r\nspeech. No such boy should have been sent to an English public school\r\nas it was in my day. His stutter was no ordinary one, for it\r\nconsisted, not in repeating the first letter or syllable, but in\r\nblowing out both cheeks like a balloon, and making noises which\r\nresembled a back-firing motor engine. It was the custom of our form\r\nmaster to make us say our repetition by each boy taking one line, the\r\nlast round being always \"expressed\"--that is, unless you started\r\ninstantly the boy above you finished, the next boy began, and took\r\nyour place. I can still see and hear the unfortunate J. getting up\r\nsteam for his line four or five boys ahead of time, so that he might\r\nexplode at the right moment, which desirable end, however, he but very\r\nrarely accomplished, and never catching up, he used, like the man in\r\nthe parable, always to \"begin with shame to take the lowest place.\"\r\nSometimes the master in a merciful mood allowed us to write the line;\r\nbut that was risky, for it was considered no disgrace to circumvent\r\nhim, and under those circumstances it was very easy for the next boy\r\nto write his own and then yours, and pass it along if he saw you were\r\nin trouble.\r\n\r\nThere was, and I think with some reason, a pride among the boys on\r\ntheir appearance on certain occasions. It went by the name of \"good\r\nform.\" Thus on Sundays at morning chapel, we always wore a button-hole\r\nflower if we could. My dear mother used to post me along a little box\r\nof flowers every week--nor was it by any means wasted energy, for not\r\nonly did the love for flowers become a hobby and a custom with many of\r\nus through life, and a help to steer clear of sloppiness in\r\nappearance, but it was a habit quite likely to spread to the soul. But\r\nbeyond that, the picture of my dear mother, with the thousand worries\r\nof a large school of small boys on her hands, finding time to gather,\r\npack, address, and post each week with her own hands so fleeting and\r\ninessential a token of her love, has a thousand times arisen to my\r\nmemory, and led me to consider some apparently quite unnecessary\r\nlittle labour of love as being well worth the time and trouble. It is\r\nthese deeds of love--not words, however touching--that never fade from\r\nthe soul, and to the last make their appeal to the wandering boy to\r\n\"arise\" and do things.\r\n\r\nLike everything else this fastidiousness can be overdone, and I\r\nremember once a boy's legal guardian showing me a bill for a hundred\r\npounds sterling that his ward had incurred in a single term for cut\r\nflowers. Yet \"form\" is a part of the life of all English schools, and\r\nthe boys think much more of it than sin. At Harrow you may not walk in\r\nthe middle of the road as a freshman; and in American schools and\r\nuniversities, such regulations as the \"Fence\" laws at Yale show that\r\nthey have emulated and even surpassed us in these. It was, however, a\r\nvery potent influence, and we were always ridiculously sensitive about\r\nbreaches of it. Thus, on a certain prize day my friend \"Mad G.,\"\r\nhaving singularly distinguished himself in his studies, his parents\r\ncame all the way from their home, at great expense to themselves, to\r\nsee their beloved and only son honoured. I presume that, though wild\r\nhorses would not drag anything out of the boy at school, he had\r\ncommunicated to them the details of some little service rendered. For\r\nto my horror I was stopped by his mother, whom I subsequently learned\r\nto love and honour above most people, and actually kissed while\r\nwalking in the open quad--strutting like a peacock, I suppose, for I\r\nremember feeling as if the bottom had suddenly fallen out of the\r\nearth. The sequel, however, was an invitation to visit their home in\r\nNorth Wales for the Christmas holidays, where there was rough\r\nshooting,--the only kind I really cared for,--boating, rock-climbing,\r\nbathing, and the companionship of as lively a family as it was\r\npossible to meet anywhere. Many a holiday afterwards we shared\r\ntogether, and the kindness showered upon me I shall never be able to\r\nforget, or, alas, return; for my dear friend \"Mad G.\" has long ago\r\ngone to his rest, and so have both his parents, whom I loved almost as\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nAnother thing for which I have much to thank my parents is the\r\ninterest which they encouraged me to take in the collecting and study\r\nof natural objects. We were taught that the only excuse that made the\r\ntaking of animal life honourable was for some useful purpose, like\r\nfood or study or self-preservation. Several cases of birds stuffed and\r\nset up when we were fourteen and sixteen years of age still adorn the\r\nold house. Every bit had to be done by ourselves, my brother making\r\nthe cases, and I the rock work and taxidermy. The hammering-up of\r\nsandstone and granite; to cover the glue-soaked brown paper that we\r\nmoulded into rocks, satisfied my keenest instinct for making messes,\r\nand only the patience of the old-time domestics would have \"stood for\r\nit.\" My brother specialized in birds' eggs, and I in butterflies and\r\nmoths. Later we added seaweeds, shells, and flowers. Some of our\r\ncollections have been dissipated; and though we have not a really\r\nscientific acquaintance with either of these kingdoms, we acquired a\r\n\"hail-fellow-well-met\" familiarity with all of them, which has\r\nenlivened many a day in many parts of the world as we have journeyed\r\nthrough life. Moreover, though purchased pictures have other values,\r\nthe old cases set on the walls of one's den bring back memories that\r\nare the joy and solace of many idle moments later in life--each rarer\r\negg, each extra butterfly picturing some day or place of keen triumph,\r\notherwise long since forgotten. Here, for instance, is a convolvulus\r\nhawk father found killed on a mountain in Switzerland; there an Apollo\r\nI caught in the Pyrenees; here a \"red burnet\" with \"five eyes\"\r\ncaptured as we raced through the bracken on Clifton Downs; and there\r\nare \"purple emperors\" wired down to \"meat\" baits on the Surrey Downs.\r\n\r\nMany a night at school have I stolen into the great forest, my\r\nbutterfly net under my coat, to try and add a new specimen to my\r\nhoard. We were always supplied with good \"key-books,\" so that we\r\nshould be able to identify our specimens, and also to search for\r\nothers more intelligently. One value of my own specialty was that for\r\nthe moths it demanded going out in the night, and the thrills of out\r\nof doors in the beautiful summer evenings, when others were \"fugging\"\r\nin the house or had gone to bed, used actually to make me dance\r\naround on the grass. The dark lantern, the sugaring of the tree stems\r\nwith intoxicating potions, and the subsequent excitement of searching\r\nfor specimens, fascinated me utterly. Our breeding from the egg,\r\nthrough the caterpillar stage, taught us many things without our\r\nknowing that we were learning.\r\n\r\nOne of our holidays was memorable, because as soon as our parents left\r\nwe invited my friend and two sisters as well to come and stay with us.\r\nThey came, fully expecting that mother had asked them, but were good\r\nenough sports to stay when they found it was only us two boys. They\r\ngreatly added to the enjoyment of the days, and if they had not been\r\nsuch inveterate home letter-writers--a habit of which we were very\r\ncontemptuous--it would have saved us boys much good-humoured teasing\r\nafterwards, for the matron would have been mum and no one the wiser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEARLY WORK IN LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1883 my father became anxious to give up teaching boys and to\r\nconfine himself more exclusively to the work of a clergyman. With this\r\nin view he contemplated moving to London where he had been offered the\r\nchaplaincy of the huge London Hospital. I remember his talking it over\r\nwith me, and then asking if I had any idea what I wanted to do in\r\nlife. It came to me as a new conundrum. It had never occurred to me to\r\nlook forward to a profession; except that I knew that the heads of\r\ntigers, deer, and all sorts of trophies of the chase which adorned our\r\nhouse came from soldier uncles and others who hunted them in India,\r\nand I had always thought that their occupation would suit my taste\r\nadmirably. It never dawned on me that I would have to earn my bread\r\nand butter--that had always come along. Moreover, I had never seen\r\nreal poverty in others, for all the fisher-folk in our village seemed\r\nto have enough. I hated dress and frills, and envied no one. At\r\nschool, and on the Riviera, and even in Wales, I had never noticed any\r\nwant. It is true that a number of dear old ladies from the village\r\ncame in the winter months to our house once or twice a week to get\r\nsoup. They used to sit in the back hall, each with a round tin can\r\nwith a bucket handle. These were filled with hot broth, and the old\r\nladies were given a repast as well before leaving. As a matter of fact\r\nI very seldom actually saw them, for that part of the house was cut\r\noff entirely by large double green-baize covered doors. But I often\r\nknew that they must have been there, because our Skye terrier, though\r\nfed to overflowing, usually attended these séances, and I presume,\r\nwhile the old ladies were occupied with lunch, sampled the cans of\r\nsoup that stood in rows along the floor. He used to come along with\r\ndripping whiskers which betrayed his excursion, and the look of a\r\nconnoisseur in his large round eyes--as if he were certifying that\r\njustice had been done once more in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in France the mother of my best chum in school had been\r\npassing through Marseilles on her way home from India, and had most\r\nkindly taken me on a jolly trip to Arles, Avignon, and other\r\nhistorical places. She was the wife of a famous missionary in India.\r\nShe spoke eight languages fluently, including Arabic, and was a\r\nperfect \"vade mecum\" of interesting information which she well knew\r\nhow to impart. She had known my mother's family all her life, they\r\nbeing Anglo-Indians in the army service.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of my father's question, my friend's mother was staying\r\nin Chester with her brother-in-law, the Lord Lieutenant of\r\nDenbighshire. It was decided that as she was a citizeness of the\r\nworld, no one could suggest better for what profession my peculiar\r\ntalents fitted me. The interview I have long ago forgotten, but I\r\nrecall coming home with a confused idea that tiger hunting would not\r\nsupport me, and that she thought I ought to become a clergyman, though\r\nit had no attraction for me, and I decided against it.\r\n\r\nNone of our family on either side, so far as I can find out, had ever\r\npractised medicine. My own experience of doctors had been rather a\r\nchequered one, but at my father's suggestion I gladly went up and\r\ndiscussed the matter with our country family doctor. He was a fine\r\nman, and we boys were very fond of him and his family, his daughter\r\nbeing our best girl friend near by. He had an enormous practice, in\r\nwhich he was eminently successful. The number of horses he kept, and\r\nthe miles he covered with them, were phenomenal in my mind. He had\r\nalways a kind word for every one, and never gave us boys away, though\r\nhe must have known many of our pranks played in our parents' absence.\r\nThe only remaining memory of that visit was that the old doctor\r\nbrought down from one of his shelves a large jar, out of which he\r\nproduced a pickled human brain. I was thrilled with entirely new\r\nemotions. I had never thought of man's body as a machine. That this\r\nweird, white, puckered-up mass could be the producer or transmitter of\r\nall that made man, that it controlled our physical strength and\r\ngrowth, and our responses to life, that it made one into \"Mad G.\" and\r\nanother into me--why, it was absolutely marvellous. It attracted me as\r\ndid the gramophone, the camera, the automobile.\r\n\r\nMy father saw at once on my return that I had found my real interest,\r\nand put before me two alternative plans, one to go to Oxford, where my\r\nbrother had just entered, or to join him in London and take up work in\r\nthe London Hospital and University, preparatory to going in for\r\nmedicine. I chose the latter at once--a decision I have never\r\nregretted. I ought to say that business as a career was not suggested.\r\nIn England, especially in those days, these things were more or less\r\nhereditary. My forbears were all fighters or educators, except for an\r\noccasional statesman or banker. Probably there is some advantage in\r\nthis plan.\r\n\r\nThe school had been leased for a period of seven years to a very\r\ndelightful successor, it being rightly supposed that after that time\r\nmy brother would wish to assume the responsibility.\r\n\r\nSome of the subjects for the London matriculation were quite new to\r\nme, especially \"English.\" But with the fresh incentive and new vision\r\nof responsibility I set to work with a will, and soon had mastered the\r\nten required subjects sufficiently to pass the examination with\r\ncredit. But I must say here that Professor Huxley's criticisms of\r\nEnglish public school teaching of that period were none too stringent.\r\nI wish with all my heart that others had spoken out as bravely, for in\r\nthose days that wonderful man was held up to our scorn as an atheist\r\nand iconoclast. He was, however, perfectly right. We spent years of\r\nlife and heaps of money on our education, and came out knowing nothing\r\nto fit us for life, except that which we picked up incidentally.\r\n\r\nI now followed my father to London, and found every subject except my\r\nchemistry entirely new. I was not familiar with one word of botany,\r\nzoölogy, physics, physiology, or comparative anatomy. About the\r\nuniverse which I inhabited I knew as little as I did about cuneiform\r\nwritings. Except for my mathematics and a mere modicum of chemistry I\r\nhad nothing on which to base my new work; and students coming from\r\nGovernment free schools, or almost anywhere, had a great advantage\r\nover men of my previous education; I did not even know how to study\r\nwisely. Again, as Huxley showed, medical education in London was so\r\ndivided, there being no teaching university, that the curriculum was\r\nridiculously inadequate. There were still being foisted upon the world\r\nfar too many medical men of the type of Bob Sawyer.\r\n\r\nThere were fourteen hospitals in London to which medical schools were\r\nattached. Our hospital was the largest in the British Isles, and in\r\nthe midst of the poorest population in England, being located in the\r\nfamous Whitechapel Road, and surrounded by all the purlieus of the\r\nEast End of the great city. Patients came from Tilbury Docks to\r\nBillingsgate Market, and all the river haunts between; from Shadwell,\r\nDeptford, Wapping, Poplar, from Petticoat Lane and Radcliffe Highway,\r\nmade famous by crime and by Charles Dickens. They came from Bethnal\r\nGreen, where once queens had their courts, now the squalid and crowded\r\nhome of poverty; from Stratford and Bow, and a hundred other slums.\r\n\r\nThe hospital had some nine hundred beds, which were always so full\r\nthat the last surgeon admitting to his wards constantly found himself\r\nwith extra beds poked in between the regulation number through sheer\r\nnecessity. It afforded an unrivalled field for clinical experience and\r\npractical teaching. In my day, however, owing to its position in\r\nLondon, and the fact that its school was only just emerging from\r\nprimeval chaos, it attracted very few indeed of the medical students\r\nfrom Oxford and Cambridge, who are obliged to come to London for their\r\nlast two or three years' hospital work--the scope in those small\r\nuniversity towns being decidedly limited.\r\n\r\nLooking back I am grateful to my alma mater, and have that real\r\naffection for her that every loyal son should have. But even that does\r\nnot conceal from me how poor a teaching establishment it was. Those\r\nwho had natural genius, and the advantages of previous scientific\r\ntraining, who were sons of medical men, or had served apprenticeships\r\nto them, need not have suffered so much through its utter\r\ninefficiency. But men in my position suffered quite unconsciously a\r\nterrible handicap, and it was only the influences for which I had\r\nnothing whatever to thank the hospital that saved me from the\r\ncatastrophes which overtook so many who started with me.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there was no supervision of our lives whatever. We were\r\nflung into a coarse and evil environment, among men who too often\r\ntook pride in their shame, just to sink or swim. Not one soul cared\r\nwhich you did. I can still remember numerous cases where it simply\r\nmeant that men paid quite large sums for the privilege of sending the\r\nsons they loved direct to the devil. I recall one lad whom I had known\r\nat school. His father lavished money upon him, and sincerely believed\r\nthat his son was doing him credit and would soon return to share his\r\nlarge practice, and bring to it all the many new advances he had\r\nlearned. The reports of examinations successfully passed he fully\r\naccepted; and the non-return of his son at vacation times he put down\r\nto professional zeal. It was not till the time came for the boy to get\r\nhis degree and return that the father discovered that he had lived\r\nexactly the life of the prodigal in the parable, and had neither\r\nattended college nor attempted a single examination of any kind\r\nwhatever. It broke the father's heart and he died.\r\n\r\nExaminations for degrees were held by the London University, or the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons, never by the hospital\r\nschools. These were practically race committees; they did no teaching,\r\nbut when you had done certain things, they allowed you to come up and\r\nbe examined, and if you got through a written and \"viva voce\"\r\nexamination you were inflicted on an unsuspecting public \"qualified to\r\nkill\"--often only too literally so.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious on the face of it that this could be no proper criterion\r\nfor so important a decision as to qualifications; special crammers\r\nstudied the examiners, their questions, and their teachings, and luck\r\nhad a great deal to do with success. While some men never did\r\nthemselves justice in examinations, others were exactly the reverse.\r\nThus I can remember one resident accoucheur being \"ploughed,\" as we\r\ncalled it, in his special subject, obstetrics--and men to whom you\r\nwouldn't trust your cat getting through with flying colours.\r\n\r\nOf the things to be done: First you had to be signed up for attending\r\ncourses of lectures on certain subjects. This was simply a matter of\r\ntipping the beadle, who marked you off. I personally attended only two\r\nbotany lectures during the whole course. At the first some practical\r\njoker had spilled a solution of carbon bisulphide all over the\r\nprofessor's platform, and the smell was so intolerable that the\r\nlecture was prorogued. At the second, some wag let loose a couple of\r\npigeons, whereupon every one started either to capture them or stir\r\nthem up with pea-shooters. The professor said, \"Gentlemen, if you do\r\nnot wish to learn, you are at liberty to leave.\" The entire class\r\nwalked out. The insignificant sum of two and sixpence secured me my\r\nsign-up for the remainder of the course.\r\n\r\nMateria medica was almost identical; and while we had better fortune\r\nwith physiology, no experience and no apparatus for verifying its\r\nteachings were ever shown us.\r\n\r\nOur chemistry professor was a very clever man, but extremely\r\neccentric, and his class was pandemonium. I have seen him so\r\nfrequently pelted with peas, when his head was turned, as to force him\r\nto leave the amphitheatre in despair. I well remember also an\r\nunpopular student being pushed down from the top row almost on to the\r\nexperiment table.\r\n\r\nThere was practically no histology taught, and little or no pathology.\r\nAlmost every bit of the microscope which I did was learned on my own\r\ninstrument at home. Anatomy, however, we were well taught in the\r\ndissecting-room, where we could easily obtain all the work we needed.\r\nBut not till Sir Frederick Treves became our lecturer in anatomy and\r\nsurgery was it worth while doing more than pay the necessary sum to\r\nget signed up.\r\n\r\nIn the second place we had to attend in the dispensary, actually to\r\nhandle drugs and learn about them--an admirable rule. Personally I\r\nwent once, fooled around making egg-nogg, and arranged with a\r\nconsiderate druggist to do the rest that was necessary. Yet I\r\nsatisfied the examiners at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,\r\nthose of the London University at the examinations for Bachelor of\r\nMedicine--the only ones which they gave which carried questions in any\r\nof these subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the athletic life of the University, however, I took great\r\ninterest, and was secretary in succession of the cricket, football,\r\nand rowing clubs. I helped remove the latter from the old river Lea to\r\nthe Thames, to raise the inter-hospital rowing championship and start\r\nthe united hospitals' rowing club. I found time to row in the\r\ninter-hospital race for two years and to play on the football team in\r\nthe two years of which we won the inter-hospital football cup. A few\r\ntimes I played with the united hospitals' team; but I found that their\r\nways were not mine, as I had been taught to despise alcohol as a\r\nbeverage and to respect all kinds of womanhood. For three years I\r\nplayed regularly for Richmond--the best of the London clubs at the\r\ntime--and subsequently for Oxford, being put on the team the only term\r\nI was in residence. I also threw the hammer for the hospital in the\r\nunited hospitals' sports, winning second place for two years. Indeed,\r\nathletics in some form occupied every moment of my spare time.\r\n\r\nIt was in my second year, 1885, that returning from an out-patient\r\ncase one night, I turned into a large tent erected in a purlieu of\r\nShadwell, the district to which I happened to have been called. It\r\nproved to be an evangelistic meeting of the then famous Moody and\r\nSankey. It was so new to me that when a tedious prayer-bore began with\r\na long oration, I started to leave. Suddenly the leader, whom I\r\nlearned afterwards was D.L. Moody, called out to the audience, \"Let us\r\nsing a hymn while our brother finishes his prayer.\" His practicality\r\ninterested me, and I stayed the service out. When eventually I left,\r\nit was with a determination either to make religion a real effort to\r\ndo as I thought Christ would do in my place as a doctor, or frankly\r\nabandon it. That could only have one issue while I still lived with a\r\nmother like mine. For she had always been my ideal of unselfish love.\r\nSo I decided to make the attempt, and later went down to hear the\r\nbrothers J.E. and C.T. Studd speak at some subsidiary meeting of the\r\nMoody campaign. They were natural athletes, and I felt that I could\r\nlisten to them. I could not have listened to a sensuous-looking man, a\r\nman who was not a master of his own body, any more than I could to a\r\nprecentor, who coming to sing the prayers at college chapel\r\ndedication, I saw get drunk on sherry which he abstracted from the\r\nbanquet table just before the service. Never shall I forget, at the\r\nmeeting of the Studd brothers, the audience being asked to stand up if\r\nthey intended to try and follow Christ. It appeared a very sensible\r\nquestion to me, but I was amazed how hard I found it to stand up. At\r\nlast one boy, out of a hundred or more in sailor rig, from an\r\nindustrial or reformatory ship on the Thames, suddenly rose. It seemed\r\nto me such a wonderfully courageous act--for I knew perfectly what it\r\nwould mean to him--that I immediately found myself on my feet, and\r\nwent out feeling that I had crossed the Rubicon, and must do something\r\nto prove it.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: OXFORD UNIVERSITY RUGBY UNION FOOTBALL TEAM\r\n   W.T. Grenfell at left of bottom row]\r\n\r\nWe were Church of England people, and I always attended service with\r\nmy mother at an Episcopal church of the evangelical type. At her\r\nsuggestion I asked the minister if I could in any way help. He offered\r\nme a class of small boys in his Sunday School, which I accepted with\r\nmuch hesitation. The boys, derived from houses in the neighbourhood,\r\nwere as smart as any I have known. With every faculty sharpened by the\r\ncompetition of the street, they so tried my patience with their pranks\r\nthat I often wondered what strange attraction induced them to come at\r\nall. The school and church were the property of a society known by the\r\nuninviting title of the \"Episcopal Society for the promotion of\r\nChristianity among the Jews.\" It owned a large court, shut off from\r\nthe road by high gates, around which stood about a dozen houses--with\r\nthe church facing the gates at one end of a pretty avenue of trees. It\r\nwas an oasis in the desert of that dismal region. It possessed also an\r\nindustrial institution for helping its converts to make a living, when\r\ndriven out of their own homes; and its main work was carried on for\r\nthe most part by superannuated missionaries. One was from Bagdad, I\r\nremember, and one from Palestine, both themselves Jews by extraction.\r\nThese missionaries were paid such miserable salaries that in their old\r\nage they were always left very poor.\r\n\r\nOne instance of a baptism I have never forgotten. I was then living in\r\nthe court, having hired a nice separate house under the trees after my\r\nfather had died and my mother had moved to Hampstead. In such a\r\ndistrict the house was a Godsend. One Sunday I was strolling in the\r\ncourt when the clergyman came rushing out of the church and called to\r\nme in great excitement, \"The church is full of Jews. They are going to\r\ncarry off Abraham. Can't you go in and help while I fetch the police?\"\r\nMy friend and I therefore rushed in as directed to a narrow alleyway\r\nbetween high box pews which led into the vestry, into which \"Abraham\"\r\nhad been spirited. The door being shut and our backs put to it, it was\r\na very easy matter to hold back the crowd, who probably supposed at\r\nfirst that we were leading the abduction party. There being only room\r\nfor two to come on at once, \"those behind cried forward, and those in\r\nfront back,\" till after very little blood spilt, we heard the police\r\nin the church, and the crowd at once took to flight. I regret to say\r\nthat we expedited the rear-guard by football rather than strictly\r\nChristian methods. His friends then charged Abraham with theft,\r\nexpecting to get him out of his place of refuge and then trap him, as\r\nwe were told they had a previous convert. We therefore accompanied him\r\npersonally through the mean streets, both to and fro, spoiling for\r\nmore fun. But they displayed more discretion than valour, and to the\r\nbest of my belief he escaped their machinations.\r\n\r\nMy Sunday-School efforts did not satisfy me. The boys were few, and I\r\nfailed to see any progress. But I had resolved that I would do no work\r\non Sundays except for others, so I joined a young Australian of my\r\nclass in hospital in holding services on Sunday nights in half a dozen\r\nof the underground lodging-houses along the Radcliffe Highway. He was\r\na good musician, so he purchased a fine little portable harmonium, and\r\nwhatever else the lodgers thought of us, they always liked the music.\r\nWe used to meet for evening tea at a place in the famous Highway known\r\nas \"The Stranger's Rest,\" outside of which an open-air service was\r\nalways held for the sailors wandering up and down the docks. At these\r\na number of ladies would sing; and after the meetings a certain number\r\nof the sailors were asked to come in and have refreshments. There were\r\nalways some who had spent their money on drink, or been robbed, or\r\nwere out of ships, and many of them were very fine men. Some were\r\nforeigners--so much so that a bit farther down the road a Norwegian\r\nlady carried on another similar work, especially for Scandinavians.\r\n\r\nA single story will illustrate the good points which some of these men\r\ndisplayed. My hospital chief, Sir Frederick Treves, had operated on a\r\ngreat big Norwegian, and the man had left the hospital cured. As a\r\nrule such patients do not even know the name of their surgeon. Some\r\nthree weeks later, however, this man called at Sir Frederick Treves's\r\nhouse late one dark night. Having asked if he were the surgeon who had\r\noperated on him and getting a reply in the affirmative, he said he had\r\ncome to return thanks, that since he left hospital he had been\r\nwandering about without a penny to his name, waiting for a ship, but\r\nhad secured a place on that day. He proceeded to cut out from the\r\nupper edge of his trousers a gold Norwegian five-kronen piece which\r\nhis wife had sewed in there to be his stand-by in case of absolute\r\nneed. He had been so hungry that he had been tempted to use it, but\r\nnow had come to present it as a token of gratitude--upon which he\r\nbowed and disappeared. Sir Frederick said that he was so utterly taken\r\naback that he found himself standing in the hall, holding the coin,\r\nand bowing his visitor out. He said he could no more return it than\r\nyou could offer your teacher a \"tip,\" and he has preserved it as a\r\nmuch-prized possession.\r\n\r\nThe underground lodging-house work did me lots of good. It brought me\r\ninto touch with real poverty--a very graveyard of life I had never\r\nsurmised. The denizens of those miserable haunts were men from almost\r\nevery rank of life. They were shipwrecks from the ocean of humanity,\r\ndrifted up on the last beach. There were large open fireplaces in the\r\ndens, over which those who had any food cooked it. Often while the\r\nother doctor or I was holding services, one of us would have to sit\r\ndown on some drunken man to keep him from making the proceedings\r\nimpossible; but there was always a modicum who gathered around and\r\nreally enjoyed the singing.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that there were no depths of contemptible treachery\r\nwhich some among these new acquaintances would not attempt. We became\r\ngradually hardened to the piteous tales of ill luck, of malignant\r\npersecution, and of purely temporary embarrassments, and learned soon\r\nto leave behind us purses, and watches, and anything else of value,\r\nand to keep some specially worn clothing for this service.\r\n\r\nThere was always a narrow passage from the front door to the staircase\r\nwhich led down into those huge underground basements. The guardians\r\nhad a room inside the door, with a ticket window, where they took five\r\nor possibly eight cents from the boarders for their night's lodging.\r\nAt about eleven o'clock a \"chucker out\" would go down and clear out\r\nall the gentlemen who had not paid in advance for the night. This was\r\nalways a very melancholy period of the evening, and in spite of our\r\nhardened hearts, we always had a score against us there. That,\r\nhowever, had to be given in person, for there were plenty among our\r\naudiences who had taken special courses in imitative calligraphy.\r\nI.O.U.'s on odd bits of paper were a menace to our banking accounts\r\ntill we sorrowfully abandoned that convenient way of helping often a\r\nreally deserving case.\r\n\r\nIn those houses, somewhat to my astonishment, we never once received\r\nany physical opposition. We knew that some considered us harmless and\r\ngullible imbeciles; but the great majority were still able to see that\r\nit was an attempt, however poor, to help them. Drink, of course, was\r\nthe chief cause of the downfall of most; but as I have already said,\r\nthere were cases of genuine, undeserved poverty--like our sailor\r\nfriend, overtaken with sickness in a foreign port. We induced some to\r\nsign the pledge and to keep it, if only temporarily, but I think that\r\nwe ourselves got most out of the work, both in pleasure and uplift. I\r\nrecall one clergyman, one doctor, and many men from the business world\r\nand clerk's life in the flotsam and jetsam.\r\n\r\nOne poor creature, in the last stage of poverty and dirt, proved to be\r\nan honours man in Oxford. We looked up his record in the University.\r\nHe assured us that he intended to begin again a new life, and we\r\nagreed to help start him. We took him to a respectable, temperance\r\nlodging-house, paid for a bed, a bath, and a supper, and purchased a\r\ngood second-hand outfit of clothing for him. We were wise enough only\r\nto give this to him after we had taken away his own while he was\r\nhaving a bath in the tub. We did not give him a penny of money,\r\nfearing his lack of control. Next morning, however, when we went for\r\nhim, he was gone--no one knew where. We had the neighbouring saloons\r\nsearched, and soon got track of him. Some \"friend\" in the temperance\r\nhouse had given him sixpence. The barman offered him the whiskey; his\r\nhands trembled so that he could not lift the glass to his mouth, and\r\nthe barman kindly poured it down his throat. We never saw him again.\r\n\r\nIn this lodging-house work a friend, now a well-known artist and\r\nsuccessful business man, often joined us two doctors.\r\n\r\nMy growing experience had shown me that there was a better way to the\r\nhearts of my Sunday-School boys than merely talking to them. Like\r\nmyself, they worshipped the athlete, whether he were a prize-fighter\r\nor a big football player. There were no Y.M.C.A.'s or other places for\r\nthem to get any physical culture, so we arranged to clear our\r\ndining-room every Saturday evening, and give boxing lessons and\r\nparallel-bar work: the ceiling was too low for the horizontal. The\r\ntransformation of the room was easily accomplished. The furniture was\r\nvery primitive, largely our own construction, and we could throw out\r\nthrough the window every scrap of it except the table, which was soon\r\n\"adapted.\" We also put up a quoit pitch in our garden.\r\n\r\nThis is no place to discuss the spiritual influences of the \"noble art\r\nof boxing.\" Personally I have always believed in its value; and my\r\nSunday-School class soon learned the graces of fair play, how to take\r\ndefeat and to be generous in victory. They began at once bringing\r\n\"pals\" whom my exegesis on Scripture would never have lured within my\r\nreach. We ourselves began to look forward to Saturday night and Sunday\r\nafternoon with an entirely new joy. We all learned to respect and so\r\nto love one another more--indeed, lifelong friendships were developed\r\nand that irrespective of our hereditary credal affiliations. The\r\nwell-meaning clergyman, however, could not see the situation in that\r\nlight, and declining all invitations to come and sample an evening's\r\nfun instead of condemning it unheard, or I should say, unseen, he\r\ndelivered an ultimatum which I accepted--and resigned from his school.\r\n\r\nMy Australian friend was at that time wrestling with a real ragged\r\nschool on the Highway on Sunday afternoons. The poor children there\r\nwere street waifs and as wild as untamed animals. So, being\r\ntemporarily out of a Sunday job, I consented to join him.\r\n\r\nOur school-room this time owed no allegiance to any one but\r\nourselves, and the work certainly proved a real labour of love. If the\r\nboys were allowed in a minute before there was a force to cope with\r\nthem, the room would be wrecked. Everything movable was stolen\r\nimmediately opportunity arose. Boys turned out or locked out during\r\nsession would climb to the windows, and triumphantly wave stolen\r\narticles. On one occasion when I had \"chucked out\" a specially\r\nobstreperous youth, I was met with a shower of mud and stones as I\r\npassed through a narrow alley on my return home. The police were\r\nalways at war with the boys, who annoyed them in similar and many\r\nother ways. I remember two scholars whose eyes were blacked and badly\r\nbeaten by a \"cop\" who happened to catch them in our doorway, as they\r\ndeclared, \"only waiting for Sunday School to open.\" Old scores were\r\npaid off by both parties whenever possible. My own boys did not stay\r\nin the old school long after I left, but came and asked me to keep a\r\nclass on Sunday in our dining-room--an arrangement in which I gladly\r\nacquiesced, though it involved my eventually abandoning the ragged\r\nschool, which was at least two miles distant.\r\n\r\nWith the night work at the lodging-houses, we used to combine a very\r\naggressive total abstinence campaign. The saloon-keepers as a rule\r\nlooked upon us as harmless cranks, and I have no doubt were grateful\r\nfor the leaflets we used to distribute to their customers. These\r\nserved admirably for kindling purposes. At times, however, they got\r\nugly, and once my friend, who was in a saloon talking to a customer,\r\nwas trapped and whiskey poured into his mouth. On another occasion I\r\nnoticed that the outer doors were shut and a couple of men backed up\r\nagainst them while I was talking to the bartender over the counter,\r\nand that a few other customers were closing in to repeat the same\r\nexperiment on me. However, they greatly overrated their own stock of\r\nfitness and equally underrated my good training, for the scrimmage\r\nwent all my own way in a very short time.\r\n\r\nIf ever I told my football chums (for in those days I was playing\r\nhard) of these adventures in a nether world, they always wanted to\r\ncome and coöperate; but I have always felt that reliance on physical\r\nstrength alone is only a menace when the odds are so universally in\r\nfavour of our friend the enemy. At this time also at St. Andrew's\r\nChurch, just across the Whitechapel Road from the hospital, the\r\nclergyman was a fine athlete and good boxer. He was a brother of Lord\r\nWenlock, and was one night returning from a mission service in the\r\nHighway when he was set upon by footpads and robbed of everything,\r\nincluding the boots off his feet. Meantime \"Jack the Ripper\" was also\r\ngiving our residential section a most unsavoury reputation.\r\n\r\nMy long vacations at this time were always taken on the sea. My\r\nbrother and I used to hire an old fishing smack called the \"Oyster,\"\r\nwhich we rechristened the \"Roysterer.\" This we fitted out,\r\nprovisioned, and put to sea in with an entirely untrained crew, and\r\nwithout even the convention of caring where we were bound so long as\r\nthe winds bore us cheerily along. My brother was always cook--and\r\nnever was there a better. We believed that he would have made a mark\r\nin the world as a chef, from his ability to satisfy our appetites and\r\ncater to our desires out of so ill-supplied a galley. We always took\r\nour departure from the north coast of Anglesea--a beautiful spot, and\r\nto us especially attractive as being so entirely out of the run of\r\ntraffic that we could do exactly as we pleased. We invariably took our\r\nfishing gear with us, and thus never wanted for fresh food. We could\r\nreplenish our bread, milk, butter, and egg supply at the numerous\r\nsmall ports at which we called. The first year the crew consisted of\r\nmy brother and me--skipper, mate, and cook between us--and an Oxford\r\nboating friend as second mate. For a deckhand we had a young East\r\nLondon parson, whom we always knew as \"the Puffin,\" because he so\r\nclosely resembled that particular bird when he had his vestments on.\r\nWe sailed first for Ireland, but the wind coming ahead we ran instead\r\nfor the Isle of Man. The first night at sea the very tall\r\nundergraduate as second mate had the 12 P.M. to 4 A.M. night watch.\r\nThe tiller handle was very low, and when I gave him his course at\r\nmidnight before turning in myself, he asked me if it would be a breach\r\nof nautical etiquette to sit down to steer, as that was the only\r\nalternative to directing the ship's course with his ankles. No land\r\nwas in sight, and the wind had died out when I came on deck for my 4\r\nA.M. to 8 A.M. watch. I found the second mate sitting up rubbing his\r\neyes as I emerged from the companion hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Well, where are we now? How is her head? What's my course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about such commonplace details,\" he replied. \"I have made\r\nan original discovery about these parts that I have never seen\r\nmentioned before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" I asked innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"when I sat down to steer the course you gave\r\nbrought a bright star right over the topmast head and that's what I\r\nstarted to steer by. It's a perfect marvel what a game these heavenly\r\nbodies play. We must be in some place like Alice in Wonderland. I just\r\nshut my eyes for a second and when next I opened them the sun was\r\nexactly where I had left that star--\" and he fled for shelter.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonder that we ever got anywhere, for we had not so much as a\r\nchronometer watch, and so in spite of a decrepit sextant even our\r\nlatitude was often an uncertain quantity. However, we made the port of\r\nDouglas, whence we visited quite a part of the historic island. As our\r\nparson was called home from there, we wired for and secured another\r\nchum to share our labours. Our generally unconventional attire in\r\nfashionable summer resorts was at times quite embarrassing.\r\nBarelegged, bareheaded, and \"tanned to a chip,\" I was carrying my\r\nfriend's bag along the fashionable pier to see him off on his homeward\r\njourney, when a lady stopped me and asked me if I were an Eskimo,\r\noffering me a job if I needed one. I have wondered sometimes if it\r\nwere a seat in a sideshow which she had designed for me.\r\n\r\nWe spent that holiday cruising around the island. It included getting\r\nashore off the north point of land and nearly losing the craft; and\r\nalso in Ramsey Harbour a fracas with the harbour authorities. We had\r\nrun that night on top of the full spring tide. Not knowing the\r\nharbour, we had tied up to the first bollard, and gone incontinently\r\nto sleep. We were awakened by the sound of water thundering on top of\r\nus, and rushing up found to our dismay that we were lying in the mud,\r\nand a large sewer was discharging right on to our decks. Before we had\r\ntime to get away or clean up, the harbour master, coming alongside,\r\ncalled on us to pay harbour duties. We stoutly protested that as a\r\npleasure yacht we were not liable and intended to resist to the death\r\nany such insult being put upon us. He was really able to see at once\r\nthat we were just young fellows out for a holiday, but he had the last\r\nword before a crowd of sight-seers who had gathered on the quay above\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasure yacht, pleasure yacht, indeed!\" he shouted as he rode away,\r\n\"I can prove to any man with half an eye that you are nothing but one\r\nof them old coal or mud barges.\"\r\n\r\nThe following year the wind suited better the other way. We were\r\npractically all young doctors this time, the cook being a very\r\nathletic chum in whose rooms were collected as trophies, in almost\r\nevery branch of athletics, over seventy of what we called silver\r\n\"pots.\" As a cook he proved a failure except in zeal. It didn't really\r\ninterest him, especially when the weather was lively. On one occasion\r\nI reported to the galley, though I was the skipper that year, in\r\nsearch of the rice-pudding for dinner--Dennis, our cook, being\r\ntemporarily indisposed. Such a sight as met my view! Had I been\r\nsuperstitious I should have fled. A great black column the\r\ncircumference of the boiler had risen not less than a foot above the\r\ntop rim, and was wearing the iron cover jauntily on one side as a\r\nhelmet. It proved to be rice. He had filled the saucepan with dry\r\nrice, crowded in a little water, forced the lid on very tight and left\r\nit to its own devices!\r\n\r\nNor, in his subsequent capacity as deckhand, did he redeem in our eyes\r\nthe high qualities of seamanship which we had anticipated from him.\r\n\r\nOur tour took us this time through the Menai Straits, _via_ Carnarvon\r\nand the Welsh coast, down the Irish Channel to Milford Haven. In the\r\nregion of very heavy tides and dangerous rocks near the south Welsh\r\ncoast, we doubled our watch at night. One night the wind fell very\r\nlight, and we had stood close inshore in order to pass inside the\r\nBishop Rocks. The wind died out at that very moment, and the heavy\r\ncurrent driving us down on the rocky islands threatened prematurely to\r\nterminate our cruise. The cook was asleep, as usual when called, and\r\nat last aroused to the nature of the alarm, was found leaning forward\r\nover the ship's bows with a lighted candle. When asked what he was\r\ndoing, he explained, \"Why, looking for those bishops, of course.\"\r\n\r\nNo holiday anywhere could be better sport than those cruises. There\r\nwas responsibility, yet rest, mutual dependence, and a charming,\r\nunconventional way of getting acquainted with one's own country. We\r\nvisited Carnarvon, Harlech, and other castles, lost our boat in a\r\nbreeze of wind off Dynllyn, climbed Snowden from Pwllheli Harbour, and\r\nvisited a dozen little out-of-the-world harbours that one would\r\notherwise never see. Fishing and shooting for the pot, bathing and\r\nrowing, and every kind of healthy out-of-doors pleasure was indulged\r\nin along the road of travel. Moreover, it was all made to cost just as\r\nmuch or as little as you liked.\r\n\r\nAnother amusing memory which still remains with me was at one little\r\nseaport where a very small man not over five feet high had married a\r\nwoman considerably over six. He was an idle, drunken little rascal,\r\nand I met her one day striding down the street with her intoxicated\r\nlittle spouse wrapped up in her apron and feebly protesting.\r\n\r\nOne result of these holidays was that I told my London boys about\r\nthem, using one's experiences as illustrations; till suddenly it\r\nstruck me that this was shabby Christianity. Why shouldn't these town\r\ncagelings share our holidays? Thirteen accompanied me the following\r\nsummer. We had three tents, an old deserted factory, and an\r\nuninhabited gorge by the sea, all to ourselves on the Anglesea coast,\r\namong people who spoke only Welsh. Thus we had all the joys of foreign\r\ntravel at very little cost.\r\n\r\nAmong the many tricks the boys \"got away with\" was one at the big\r\nrailway junction at Bangor, where we had an hour to wait. They\r\napparently got into the baggage-room and stole a varied assortment of\r\nlabels, which they industriously pasted over those on a large pile of\r\nluggage stacked on the platform. The subsequent tangle of destinations\r\ncan better be imagined than described.\r\n\r\nCamp rules were simple--no clothing allowed except short blue knickers\r\nand gray flannel shirts, no shoes, stockings, or caps except on\r\nSundays. The uniform was provided and was as a rule the amateur\r\nproduction of numerous friends, for our finances were strictly\r\nlimited. The knickers were not particularly successful, the legs\r\nfrequently being carried so high up that there was no space into which\r\nthe body could be inserted. Every one had to bathe in the sea before\r\nhe got any breakfast. I can still see ravenous boys staving off the\r\nevil hour till as near midday as possible. No one was allowed in the\r\nboats who couldn't swim, an art which they all quickly acquired. There\r\nwas, of course, a regular fatigue party each day for the household\r\nduties. We had no beds--sleeping on long, burlap bags stuffed with\r\nhay. A very favourite pastime was afforded by our big lifeboat, an old\r\none hired from the National Lifeboat Society. The tides flowed very\r\nstrongly alongshore, east on the flood tide and west on the ebb. Food,\r\nfishing lines, and a skipper for the day being provided, the old boat\r\nwould go off with the tide in the morning, the boys had a picnic\r\nsomewhere during the slack-water interim, and came back with the\r\nreturn tide.\r\n\r\nWhen our numbers grew, as they did to thirty the second year, and\r\nnearly a hundred in subsequent seasons, thirty or more boys would be\r\npacked off daily in that way--and yet we never lost one of them. If\r\nthey had not had as many lives as cats it would have been quite\r\nanother story. The boat had sufficient sails to give the appearance\r\nto their unfamiliar eyes of being a sailing vessel, but the real work\r\nwas done with twelve huge oars, two boys to an oar being the rule. At\r\nnights they used to come drifting homeward on the returning tides\r\nsinging their dirges, like some historic barge of old. There was one\r\nfamiliar hymn called \"Bringing in the Sheaves,\" which like everything\r\nelse these rascals adapted for the use of the moment; and many a time\r\nthe returning barge would be announced to us cooking supper in the old\r\nfactory or in the silent gorge, by the ringing echoes of many voices\r\nbeating with their oars as they came on to the words:\r\n\r\n    \"Pulling at the sweeps,\r\n    Pulling at the sweeps;\r\n    Here we come rejoicing,\r\n    Pulling at the sweeps.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the old boat's keel slid up upon the beach, there would be\r\na rush of as appreciative a supper party as ever a cook had the\r\npleasure of catering for.\r\n\r\nAn annual expedition was to the top of Mount Snowdon, the highest in\r\nEngland or Wales. It was attempted by land and water. Half of us\r\ntramped overland in forced marches to the beautiful Menai Straits,\r\ncrossed the suspension bridge, and were given splendid hospitality and\r\ngood beds on the straw of the large stables at the beautiful country\r\nseat of a friend at Treborth. Here the boat section who came around\r\nthe island were to meet us, anchoring their craft on the south side of\r\nthe Straits. Our second year the naval division did not turn up, and\r\nsome had qualms of conscience that evil might have overtaken them. Nor\r\ndid they arrive until we by land had conquered the summit, travelling\r\nby Bethesda and the famous slate quarries, and returning for the\r\nsecond evening at Treborth. We then found that they had been stranded\r\non the sands in Red Wharf Bay, so far from shore that they could\r\nneither go forward nor back; had thus spent their first night in a\r\nsomewhat chilly manner in old bathing machines by the land wash, and\r\nsupped off the superfluous hard biscuit which they had been reserving\r\nfor the return voyage. They were none the worse, however, our genial\r\nhost making it up to them in an extra generous provision and a special\r\nevening entertainment. One of my smartest boys (a Jew by nationality,\r\nfor we made no distinctions in election to our class), in recounting\r\nhis adventures to me next day, said: \"My! Doctor, I did have some fun\r\nkidding that waiter in the white choker. He took a liking to me so I\r\nlet him pal up. I told him my name was Lord Shaftesbury when I was\r\nhome, but I asked him not to let it out, and the old bloke promised he\r\nwouldn't.\" The \"old bloke\" happened to be our host, who was always in\r\ndress-clothes in the evening, the only time we were at his house.\r\n\r\nThese holidays were the best lessons of love I could show my boys. It\r\ndrew us very closely together; and to make the boys feel it less a\r\ncharitable affair, every one was encouraged to save up his railway\r\nfare and as much more as possible. By special arrangement with the\r\nrailway and other friends, and by very simple living, the per caput\r\ncharges were so much reduced that many of the boys not only paid their\r\nown expenses, but even helped their friends. The start was always\r\nattended by a crowd of relatives, all helping with the baggage. The\r\nfather of one of my boys was a costermonger, and had a horse that he\r\nhad obtained very cheap because it had a disease of the legs. He\r\nalways kept it in the downstairs portion of his house, which it\r\nentered by the front door. It was a great pleasure to him to come and\r\ncart our things free to the station. The boys used to load his cart\r\nat our house, and I remember one time that they made him haul\r\nunconsciously all the way to the big London terminal at Euston half\r\nour furniture, including our coal boxes. His son, a most charming boy,\r\nmade good in life in Australia and bought a nice house in one of the\r\nsuburbs for his father and mother. I had the pleasure one night of\r\nmeeting them all there. The father was terribly uneasy, for he said he\r\njust could not get accustomed to it. All his old \"pals\" were gone, and\r\nhis neighbours' tastes and interests were a great gulf between them. I\r\nheard later that as soon as his son left England again the old man\r\nsold the house, and returned to the more congenial associations of a\r\ncostermonger's life, where I believe he died in harness.\r\n\r\nThe last two years of my stay in London being occupied with resident\r\nwork at hospital, I could not find time for such far-off holidays, and\r\nat the suggestion of my chief, Sir Frederick Treves, himself a\r\nDorsetshire man, we camped by permission of our friends, the owners,\r\nin the grounds of Lulworth Castle, close by the sea. The class had now\r\ndeveloped into a semi-military organization. We had acquired real\r\nrifles--old-timers from the Tower of London--and our athletic clubs\r\nwere portions of the Anglesey Boys' Brigade, which antedated the Boys'\r\nBrigade of Glasgow, forerunner of the Church Lads' Brigade, and the\r\nBoy Scouts.\r\n\r\nOne of the great attractions of the new camping-ground was the\r\nexquisite country and the splendid coast, with chalk cliffs over which\r\nalmost any one could fall with impunity. Lulworth Cove, one of the\r\nmost picturesque in England, was the summer resort of my chief, and he\r\nbeing an expert mariner and swimmer used not only very often to join\r\nus at camp, but always gave the boys a fine regatta and picnic at his\r\ncottage. Our water polo games were also a great feature here, the\r\nwater being warm and enabling us easily to play out the games. There\r\nare also numerous beautiful castles and country houses all the way\r\nbetween Swanage and Weymouth, and we had such kindness extended to us\r\nwherever we went that every day was a dream of joy to the lads.\r\nWithout any question they acquired new visions and ideals through\r\nthese experiences.\r\n\r\nWe always struck camp at the end of a fortnight, having sometimes\r\narranged with other friends with classes of their own to step into our\r\nshoes. The present head master of Shrewsbury and many other\r\ndistinguished persons shared with us some of the educative joys of\r\nthose days. Among the many other more selfish portions of the holidays\r\nnone stand out more clearly in my memory than the August days when\r\npartridge and grouse shooting used to open. Most of my shooting was\r\ndone over the delightful highlands around Bishop's Castle in\r\nShropshire, on the outskirts of the Welsh hills, in Clun Forest, and\r\non the heather-covered Longmynds. How I loved those days, and the\r\nfriends who made them possible--the sound of the beaters, the\r\nintelligent setters and retrievers, the keepers in velveteens, the\r\nlunches under the shade of the great hedges or in lovely cottages,\r\nwhere the ladies used to meet us at midday, and every one used to\r\njolly you about not shooting straight, and you had to take refuge in a\r\nthousand \"ifs.\"\r\n\r\nAs one looks back on it all from Labrador, it breathes the aroma of an\r\nold civilization and ancient customs. Much of the shooting was over\r\nthe old lands of the Walcotts of Walcott Hall, a family estate that\r\nhad been bought up by Earl Clive on his return from India, and was now\r\nin the hands of his descendant, an old bachelor who shot very little,\r\nriding from one good stand to another on a steady old pony. There\r\nwere many such estates, another close by being that of the Oakovers of\r\nOakover, a family that has since sold their heritage.\r\n\r\nA thousand time-honoured old customs, only made acceptable by their\r\nhoary age, added, and still continue to add in the pleasures of\r\nmemory, to the joys of those days, with which golf and tennis and all\r\nthe wonderful luxury of the modern summer hotel seem never able to\r\ncompete. It is right, however, that such eras should pass.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful forest of Savernake, that in my school days I had loved\r\nso well, and which meant so much to us boys, spoke only too loudly of\r\nthe evil heirloom of the laws of entail. Spendthrift and dissolute\r\nheirs had made it impossible for the land to be utilized for the\r\nbenefit of the people, and yet kept it in the hands of utterly\r\nundeserving persons. Being of royal descent they still bore a royal\r\nname even in my day; but it was told of them that the last, who had\r\nbeen asked to withdraw from the school, on one occasion when, half\r\ndrunk, he was defending himself from the gibes and jeers of grooms and\r\n'ostlers whom he had made his companions, rose with ill-assumed\r\ndignity and with an oath declared that he was their king by divine\r\nright if only he had his dues. Looking back it seems to me that the\r\ngerms of democratic tendencies were sown in me by just those very\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAT THE LONDON HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never ceased to regret that there was not more corporate life\r\nin our medical school, but I believe that conditions have been greatly\r\nimproved since my day. Here and there two or three classmates would\r\n\"dig\" together, but otherwise, except at lectures or in hospitals, we\r\nseldom met unless it was on the athletic teams. We had no playground\r\nof our own, and so, unable to get other hospitals to combine, when a\r\nnow famous St. Thomas man and myself hired part of the justly\r\ncelebrated London Rowing Club Headquarters at Putney for a united\r\nhospitals' headquarters, we used to take our blazers and more\r\ncherished possessions home with us at night for fear of distraint of\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nThey were great days. Rowing on the Thames about Putney is not like\r\nthat at Oxford on a mill-pond, or as at Cambridge on what we nicknamed\r\na drain that should be roofed over. Its turgid waters were often rough\r\nenough to sink a rowing shell, and its busy traffic was a thing with\r\nwhich to reckon. But it offered associations with all kinds of\r\ninteresting places, historical and otherwise, from the Star and Garter\r\nat Richmond and the famous Park away to Boulter's Lock and Cleveden\r\nWoods, to the bathing pools about Taplow Court, the seat of the senior\r\nbranch of our family, and to Marlow and Goring where our annual club\r\noutings were held. Twice I rowed in the inter-hospital race from\r\nPutney to Mortlake, once as bow and again as stroke. During those\r\nearly days the \"London\" frequently had the best boat on the river.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished my second year at hospital and taken my\r\npreliminary examinations, including the scientific preliminary, and my\r\nfirst bachelor of medicine for the University of London degree, I had\r\nadvanced to the dignity of \"walking the hospitals,\" carried a large\r\nshining stethoscope, and spent much time following the famous\r\nphysicians and surgeons around the wards.\r\n\r\nOur first appointment was clerking in the medical wards. We had each\r\nso many beds allotted to us, and it was our business to know\r\neverything about the patients who occupied them, to keep accurate\r\n\"histories\" of all developments, and to be ready to be quizzed and\r\nqueried by our resident house physician, or our visiting consultant on\r\nthe afternoon when he made his rounds, followed by larger or smaller\r\ncrowds of students according to the value which was placed upon his\r\nteaching. I was lucky enough to work under the famous Sir Andrew\r\nClark, Mr. Gladstone's great physician. He was a Scotchman greatly\r\nbeloved, and always with a huge following to whom he imparted far more\r\nvaluable truths than even the medical science of thirty years ago\r\nafforded. His constant message, repeated and repeated at the risk of\r\nwearying, was: \"Gentlemen, you must observe for yourselves. It is your\r\nobservation and not your memory which counts. It is the patient and\r\nnot the disease whom you are treating.\"\r\n\r\nCompared with the methods of diagnosis to-day those then were very\r\nlimited, but Sir Andrew's message was the more important, showing the\r\ngreatness of the man, who, though at the very top of the tree, never\r\nfor a moment tried to convey to his followers that his knowledge was\r\nfinal, but that any moment he stood ready to abandon his position for\r\na better one. On one occasion, to illustrate this point, while he was\r\nin one of the largest of our wards (one with four divisions and twenty\r\nbeds each) he was examining a lung case, while a huge class of fifty\r\nyoung doctors stood around.\r\n\r\n\"What about the sputum, Mr. Jones?\" he asked. \"What have you observed\r\ncoming from these lungs?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not much quantity, sir. It is greenish in colour.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about the microscope, Mr. Jones? What does that show?\"\r\n\r\n\"No examination has been made, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I will now go to the other ward, and you shall\r\nchoose a specimen of the sputum of some of these cases. When I return\r\nwe will examine it and see what we can learn.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, four specimens awaited him, the history and\r\ndiagnoses of the cases being known only to the class. The class never\r\nforgot how by dissolving and boiling, and with the microscope, he told\r\nus almost more from his examination of each case than we knew from all\r\nour other information. His was real teaching, and reminds one of the\r\nGlasgow professor who, in order to emphasize the same point of the\r\nvalue of observation, prepared a little cupful of kerosene, mustard,\r\nand castor oil, and calling the attention of his class to it, dipped a\r\nfinger into the atrocious compound and then sucked his finger. He then\r\npassed the mixture around to the students who all did the same with\r\nmost dire results. When the cup returned and he observed the faces of\r\nhis students, he remarked: \"Gentlemen, I am afraid you did not use\r\nyour powers of obsairvation. The finger that I put into the cup was no\r\nthe same one that I stuck in my mouth afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nSir Stephen Mackenzie, who operated on the Emperor Frederick, was\r\nanother excellent teacher under whom we had the good fortune to study.\r\nIndeed, whatever could be said against the teaching of our college,\r\nin this much more important field of learning, the London Hospital was\r\nmost signally fortunate, and, moreover, was famed not only in London,\r\nbut all the world over. Our \"walking class\" used to number men from\r\nthe United States to Australia, insomuch that the crowds became so\r\nlarge that the teachers could not get room to pass along. It was this\r\nfact which led to the practice, now almost universal, of carrying the\r\npatient in his bed with a nurse in attendance into the theatre for\r\nobservation as more comfortable and profitable for all concerned.\r\n\r\nOn changing over to the surgical side in the hospital, we were\r\nemployed in a very similar manner, only we were called \"dressers,\" and\r\nunder the house surgeon had all the care of a number of surgical\r\npatients. My good fortune now brought me under the chieftaincy of Sir\r\nFrederick Treves, the doyen of teachers. His great message was\r\nself-reliance. He taught dogmatically as one having authority, and\r\nalways insisted that we should make up our minds, have a clear idea of\r\nwhat we were doing, and then do it. His ritual was always thought out,\r\nno detail being omitted, and each person had exactly his share of work\r\nand his share of responsibility. It used greatly to impress patients,\r\nand he never underestimated the psychical value of having their\r\ncomplete confidence. Thus, on one occasion asking a dresser for his\r\ndiagnosis, the student replied:\r\n\r\n\"It might be a fracture, sir, or it might be only sprained.\"\r\n\r\n\"The patient is not interested to know that it might be measles, or it\r\nmight be toothache. The patient wants to know what is the matter, and\r\nit is your business to tell it to him or he will go to a quack who\r\nwill inform him at once.\"\r\n\r\nAll his teachings were, like Mark Twain's, enhanced by such\r\nover-emphasis or exaggeration. He could make an article in the\r\n\"British Medical Journal\" on Cholecystenterostomy amusing to a general\r\nreader, and make an ordinary remark as cutting as an amputation knife.\r\nHe never permitted laxity of any kind in personal appearance or dress,\r\nor any imposing on the patients. His habit of saying openly exactly\r\nwhat he meant made many people fear, as much as they respected, him.\r\nHowever, he was always, in spite of it, the most popular of all the\r\nchiefs because he was so worth while.\r\n\r\nOne incident recurs to my mind which I must recount as an example when\r\npsychology failed. A Whitechapel \"lady,\" suffering with a very violent\r\nform of delirium tremens, was lying screeching in a strait-jacket on\r\nthe cushioned floor of the padded room. With the usual huge queue of\r\nstudents following, he had gone in to see her, as I had been unable to\r\nget the results desired with a reasonable quantity of sedatives and\r\nsoporifics. It was a very rare occasion, for cases which did not\r\ninvolve active surgery he left strictly alone. After giving a talk on\r\npsychical influence he had the jacket removed as \"a relic of\r\nbarbarism,\" and in a very impressive way looking into her glaring eyes\r\nand shaking his forefinger at her, he said: \"Now, you are comfortable,\r\nmy good woman, and will sleep. You will make no more disturbance\r\nwhatever.\" There was an unusual silence. The woman remained absolutely\r\npassive, and we all turned to follow the chief out. Suddenly the\r\n\"lady\" called out, \"Hi, hi,\"--and some perverse spirit induced Sir\r\nFrederick to return. Looking back with defiant eyes she screamed out,\r\n\"You! You with a faice! You do think yerself ---- ---- clever, don't\r\nyer?\" The strange situation was only relieved by his bursting into a\r\ngenuine fit of laughter.\r\n\r\nAmong other celebrated men who were admired and revered was Mr. Harry\r\nFenwick on the surgical side, for whom I had the honour of\r\nillustrating in colours his prize Jacksonian essay. Any talent for\r\nsketching, especially in colours, is of great value to the student of\r\nmedicine. Once you have sketched a case from nature, with the object\r\nof showing the peculiarity of the abnormality, it remains permanently\r\nin your mind. Besides this, it forces you to note small differences;\r\nin other words, it teaches you to \"obsairve.\" Thus, in the skin\r\ndepartment I was sent to reproduce a case of anthrax of the neck, a\r\nrare disease in England, though all men handling raw hides are liable\r\nto contract it. The area had to be immediately excised; yet one never\r\ncould forget the picture on one's mind. On another occasion a case of\r\ngenuine leprosy was brought in, with all the dreadful signs of the\r\ndisease. The macula rash was entirely unique so far as I knew, but a\r\nsketch greatly helped to fix it on one's memory. The poor patient\r\nproved to be one of the men who was handling the meat in London's\r\ngreatest market at Smithfield. A tremendous hue and cry spread over\r\nLondon when somehow the news got into the paper, and vegetarianism\r\nreceived a temporary boost which in my opinion it still badly needs\r\nfor the benefit of the popular welfare.\r\n\r\nAmong the prophets of that day certainly should be numbered another of\r\nour teachers, Dr. Sutton, an author, and very much of a personality.\r\nFor while being one of the consulting physicians of the largest of\r\nLondon hospitals, he was naturally scientific and strictly\r\nprofessional. He was very far, however, from being the conventionalist\r\nof those days, and the younger students used to look greatly askance\r\nat him. His message always was: \"Drugs are very little use whatever.\r\nNature is the source of healing. Give her a chance.\" Thus, a careful\r\nhistory would be read over to him; all the certain signs of typhoid\r\nwould be noted--and his comment almost always was: \"This case won't\r\nbenefit by drugs. We will have the bed wheeled out into the sunshine.\"\r\nThe next case would be acute lobar pneumonia and the same treatment\r\nwould be adopted. \"This patient needs air, gentlemen. We must wheel\r\nhim out into the sunshine\"--and so on. How near we are coming to his\r\nteaching in these days is already impressing itself upon our minds.\r\nUnfortunately the fact that the doctors realize that medicines are not\r\nso potent as our forbears thought has not left the public with the\r\nincreased confidence in the profession which the infinitely more\r\nrational treatment of to-day justifies, and valuable time is wasted\r\nand fatal delays incurred, by a return of the more impressionable\r\npublic to quacks with high-sounding titles, or to cults where faith is\r\nalmost credulity.\r\n\r\nTruly one has lived through wonderful days in the history of the\r\nhealing art. The first operations which I saw performed at our\r\nhospitals were before Lord Lister's teaching was practised; though\r\neven in my boyhood I remember getting leave to run up from Marlborough\r\nto London to see my brother, on whom Sir Joseph Lister had operated\r\nfor osteomyelitis of the leg. Our most famous surgeon in 1880 was Sir\r\nWalter Rivington; and to-day there rises in memory the picture of him\r\nremoving a leg at the thigh, clad in a blood-stained, black velvet\r\ncoat, and without any attempt at or idea of asepsis. The main thing\r\nwas speed, although the patient was under ether, and in quickly\r\nturning round the tip of the sword-like amputation knife, he made a\r\ngash in the patient's other leg. The whole thing seemed horrible\r\nenough to us students, but the surgeon smiled, saying, \"Fortunately it\r\nis of no importance, gentlemen. The man will not live.\"\r\n\r\nThe day came when every one worked under clouds of carbolic steam\r\nwhich fizzed and spouted from large brass boilers over everything; and\r\nthen the time when every one was criticizing the new, young surgeon,\r\nTreves, who was daring to discard it, and getting as good results by\r\nscrupulous cleanliness. His aphorism was, \"Gentlemen, the secret of\r\nsurgery is the nailbrush.\" Now with blood examinations, germ cultures,\r\nsera tests, X-rays, and a hundred added improvements, one can say to a\r\nfisherman in far-off Labrador arriving on a mail steamer, and to whom\r\nevery hour lost in the fishing season spells calamity, \"Yes, brother,\r\nyou can be operated on and the wound will be healed and you will be\r\nready to go back by the next steamer, unless some utterly unforeseen\r\ncircumstance arises.\"\r\n\r\nThe fallibility of diagnosis was at this very impressionable time\r\nfixed upon my mind--a fact that has since served me in good stead. For\r\nwhat can be more reactionary in human life than the man who thinks he\r\nknows it all, whether it be in science, philosophy, or religion?\r\n\r\nDuring my Christmas vacation I was asked to go north and visit my\r\nfather's brother, a well-known captain in Her Majesty's Navy, who was\r\nalso an inventor in gun machinery and sighting apparatus, and who had\r\nbeen appointed the naval head of Lord Armstrong's great works at\r\nYarrow-on-the-Tyne. All that I was told was that he had been taken\r\nwith such severe pains in the back that he needed some one with him,\r\nand my new-fledged dignity of \"walking the hospitals\" was supposed to\r\nqualify me especially for the post. Already my uncle had seen many\r\ndoctors in London and had been ordered to the Continent for rest.\r\nAfter some months, not a bit improved, he had again returned to\r\nLondon. This time the doctor told his wife that it was a mental\r\ntrouble, and that he should be sent to an asylum. This she most\r\nindignantly denied, and yet desired my company as the only medical\r\nGrenfell, who at such a crisis could stay in the house without being\r\nlooked upon as a warder or keeper. Meantime they had consulted Sir\r\nC.P., who had told my uncle that he had an aneurism of his aorta, and\r\nthat he must be prepared to have it break and kill him any minute. His\r\npreparations were accordingly all made, and personally I fully\r\nanticipated that he would fall dead before I left. He put up a\r\nwonderful fight against excruciating pain, of which I was frequently a\r\nwitness. But the days went by and nothing happened, so I returned to\r\ntown and another young doctor took my place. He also got tired of\r\nwaiting and suggested it might be some spinal trouble. He induced them\r\nonce more to visit London and see Sir Victor Horsley, whose work on\r\nthe brains of animals and men had marked an epoch in our knowledge of\r\nthe central nervous system. Some new symptoms had now supervened, and\r\nthe famous neurologist at once diagnosed a tumour in the spinal canal.\r\nSuch a case had never previously been operated on successfully, but\r\nthere was no alternative. The operation was brilliantly performed and\r\na wonderful success obtained. The case was quoted in the next edition\r\nof our surgical textbooks.\r\n\r\nA little later my father's health began to fail in London, the worries\r\nand troubles of a clergyman's work among the poor creatures who were\r\nconstantly passing under his care utterly overwhelming him. We had\r\nagreed that a long change of thought was necessary and he and I\r\nstarted for a fishing and sight-seeing tour in Norway. Our steamer was\r\nto sail from the Tyne, and we went up to Newcastle to catch it. There\r\nsome evil fiend persuaded my father to go and consult a doctor about\r\nhis illness, for Newcastle has produced some well-known names in\r\nmedicine. Thus, while I waited at the hotel to start, my father became\r\npersuaded that he had some occult disease of the liver, and must\r\nremain in Newcastle for treatment. I, however, happened to be\r\ntreasurer of the voyage, and for the first time asserting my\r\nprofessional powers, insisted that I was family physician for the\r\ntime, and turned up in the evening with all our round-trip tickets and\r\nreservations taken and paid for. In the morning I had the trunks\r\npacked and conveyed aboard, and we sailed together for one of the most\r\nenjoyable holidays I ever spent. We travelled much afoot and in the\r\nlittle native carriages called \"stolkjærre,\" just jogging along,\r\nstaying anywhere, fishing in streams, and living an open-air life\r\nwhich the increasing flood of tourists in after years have made much\r\nless possible. We both came back fitter in body and soul for our\r\nwinter's work.\r\n\r\nMy father's death a year later made a great difference to me, my\r\nmother removing to live with my grandmother at Hampstead, it being too\r\nlonely and not safe for her to live alone in East London. Twice our\r\nhouse had been broken into by burglars, though both times fruitlessly.\r\nThe second occasion was in open daylight during the hour of evening\r\nservice on a Sunday. Only a couple of maids would have been in the\r\nhouse had I not been suffering from two black eyes contracted during\r\nthe Saturday's football game. Though I had accompanied the others out,\r\ndecidedly my appearance might have led to misinterpretations in\r\nchurch, and I had returned unnoticed. The men escaped by some method\r\nwhich they had discovered of scaling a high fence, but I was close\r\nbehind following them through the window by which they had entered.\r\nShortly afterward I happened to be giving evidence at the Old Bailey\r\non one of the many cases of assault and even murder where the victims\r\nwere brought into hospital as patients. London was ringing with the\r\ntale of a barefaced murder at Murray Hill in North London, where an\r\nexceedingly clever piece of detective work, an old lantern discovered\r\nin a pawnbroker's shop in Whitechapel--miles away from the scene of\r\nthe crime--was the means of bringing to trial four of the most\r\nrascally looking villains I ever saw. The trial preceded ours and we\r\nhad to witness it. One of the gang had turned \"Queen's evidence\" to\r\nsave his own neck. So great was the hatred of the others for him and\r\nthe desire for revenge that even in the court they were hand-cuffed\r\nand in separate stands. Fresh from my own little fracas I learned what\r\na fool I had been, for in this case also the deed was done in open\r\ndaylight, and the lawn had tight wires stretched across it. The young\r\nson, giving chase as I did, had been tripped up and shot through his\r\nabdomen for his pains. He had, however, crawled back, made his will,\r\nand was subsequently only saved by a big operation. He looked in\r\nterrible shape when giving evidence at the trial.\r\n\r\nThe giving of expert evidence on such occasions was the only\r\nopportunity which the young sawbones had of earning money. True we\r\nonly got a guinea a day and expenses, but there were no other movie\r\nshows in those days, and we learned a lot about medical jurisprudence,\r\na subject which always greatly interested me. It was no uncommon sight\r\neither at the \"London\" or the \"Poplar,\" at both of which I did interne\r\nwork, to see a policeman always sitting behind the screen at the foot\r\nof the patient's bed. One man, quite a nice fellow when not occupied\r\nin crime, had when furiously drunk killed his wife and cut his own\r\nthroat. By the curious custom of society all the skill and money that\r\nthe hospital could offer to save a most valuable life was as usual\r\ndevoted to restoring this man to health. He was weaned slowly back\r\nfrom the grave by special nurses and treatment, till it began to dawn\r\nupon him that he might have to stand his trial. He would ask me if I\r\nthought he would have to undergo a long term, for he had not been\r\nconscious of what he was doing. As he grew better, and the policeman\r\narrived to watch him, he decided that it would probably be quite a\r\nlong time. He had a little place of his own somewhere, and he used to\r\nhave chickens and other presents sent up to fellow patients, and would\r\nhave done so to the nurses, only they could not receive them. I was\r\nnot personally present at his trial, but I felt really sorry to hear\r\nthat they hanged him.\r\n\r\nMany of these poor fellows were only prevented from ending their own\r\nlives by our using extreme care. The case of one wretched man, driven\r\nto desperation, I still remember. \"Patient male; age forty-five;\r\ndomestic trouble--fired revolver into his mouth. Finding no phenomena\r\nof interest develop, fired a second chamber into his right ear. Still\r\nno symptoms worthy of notice. Patient threw away pistol and walked to\r\nhospital.\" Both bullets had lodged in the thick parts of his skull,\r\nand doing no damage were left there. A subsequent note read: \"Patient\r\nto-day tried to cut his throat with a dinner-knife which he had hidden\r\nin his bed. Patient met with no success.\" Another of my cases which\r\ninterested me considerably was that of a professional burglar who had\r\nbeen operated upon in almost every part of the kingdom, and was\r\ninclined to be communicative, as the job which had brought him to\r\nhospital had cost him a broken spine. Very little hope was held out to\r\nhim that he would ever walk again. He was clear of murder, for he\r\nsaid it was never his practice to carry firearms, being a nervous man\r\nand apt to use them if he had them and got alarmed when busy\r\nburglaring. He relied chiefly on his extraordinary agility and steady\r\nhead to escape. His only yarn, however, was his last. He and a friend\r\nhad been detailed by the gang to the job of plundering one of a row of\r\nhouses. The plans of the house and of the enterprise were all in\r\norder, but some unexpected alarm was given and he fled upstairs,\r\nclimbed through a skylight onto the roof, and ran along the gables of\r\nthe tiles, not far ahead of the police, who were armed and firing at\r\nhim. He could easily have gotten away, as he could run along the\r\ncoping of the brick parapet without turning a hair, but he was brought\r\nup by a narrow side street on which he had not counted, not having\r\nanticipated, like cats, a battle on the tiles. It was only some twelve\r\nor fifteen feet across the gap, and the landing on the other side was\r\na flat roof. Taking it all at a rush he cleared the street\r\nsuccessfully, but the flat roof, black with ages of soot, proved to be\r\na glass skylight, and he entered a house in a way new even to him. His\r\nfalling on a stone floor many feet below accounted for his\r\n\"unfortunate accident\"! After many months in bed, the man took an\r\nunexpected turn, his back mended, and with only a slight leg paralysis\r\nhe was able to return to the outside world. His long suffering and\r\nincarceration in hospital were accepted by the law as his punishment,\r\nand he assured me by all that he held sacred that he intended to\r\nretire into private life. Oddly enough, however, while on another\r\ncase, I saw him again in the prisoner's dock and at once went over and\r\nspoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"Drink this time, Doctor,\" he said. \"I was down on my luck and the\r\nbarkeeper went out and left his till open. I climbed over and got the\r\ncash, but there was so little space between the bar and the wall that\r\nwith my stiff back I couldn't for the life of me get back. I was\r\njammed like a stopper in a bottle.\"\r\n\r\nAmong many interesting experiences, one especially I shall never\r\nforget. Like the others, it occurred during my service for Sir\r\nFrederick Treves as house-surgeon, and I believe he told the story. A\r\nvery badly burned woman had been brought into hospital. Her dress had\r\nsomehow got soaked in paraffin and had then taken fire. Her terribly\r\nextensive burns left no hope whatever of her recovery, and only the\r\nconventions of society kept us from giving the poor creature the\r\nrelief of euthanasia, or some cup of laudanum negus. But the law was\r\ninterested. A magistrate was brought to the bedside and the husband\r\nsent for. The nature of the evidence, the meaning of an oath, the\r\nimportance of the poor creature acknowledging that her words were\r\nspoken \"in hopeless fear of immediate death,\" were all duly impressed\r\nupon what remained of her mind. The police then brought in the savage,\r\ndegraded-looking husband, and made him stand between two policemen at\r\nthe foot of the bed, facing his mangled wife. The magistrate, after\r\npreliminary questions, asked her to make her dying statement as to how\r\nshe came by her death. There was a terrible moment of silence. It\r\nseemed as if her spirit were no longer able to respond to the stimuli\r\nof life on earth. Then a sudden rebound appeared to take place, her\r\neyes lit up with a flash of light, and even endeavouring to raise her\r\npiteous body, she said, \"It was an accident, Judge. I upset the lamp\r\nmyself, so help me God\"; and just for one moment her eyes met those of\r\nher miserable husband. It was the last time she spoke.\r\n\r\nTragedy and comedy ran hand in hand even in this work. St. Patrick's\r\nDay always made the hospital busy, just as Christmas was the season\r\nfor burned children. Beer in an East London \"pub\" was generally served\r\nin pewter pots, as they were not easily broken. A common head injury\r\nwas a circular scalp cut made by the heavy bottom rim, a wound which\r\nbled horribly. A woman was brought in on one St. Patrick's Day, her\r\nscalp turned forward over her face and her long hair a mass of clotted\r\nblood from such a stroke, made while she was on the ground. When the\r\nnecessary readjustments had been made and she was leaving hospital\r\ncured, we asked her what had been the cause of the trouble. \"'Twas\r\njust an accidint, yer know. Sure, me an' another loidy was just havin'\r\na few words.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion late at night, we were called out of bed by a\r\ncantankerous, half-drunken fellow whom the night porter could not\r\npacify. \"I'm a regular subscriber to this hospital, and I have never\r\nhad my dues yet,\" he kept protesting. A new drug to produce immediate\r\nvomiting had just been put on the market, and as it was exactly the\r\ntreatment he required, we gave him an injection. To our dismay, though\r\nthe medicine is in common use to-day, either the poison which he had\r\nbeen drinking or the drug itself caused a collapse followed by head\r\nsymptoms. He was admitted, his head shaved and icebags applied, with\r\nthe result that next day he was quite well again. But when he left he\r\nhad, instead of a superabundance of curly, auburn hair, a polished\r\nwhite knob oiled and shining like a State House at night. We debated\r\nwhether his subscription would be as regular in future, though he\r\nprofessed to be profoundly grateful.\r\n\r\nI have digressed, but the intimacy which grew up between some of my\r\npatients and myself seemed worth while recounting, for they showed me\r\nwhat I never in any other way could have understood about the seamy\r\nside of life in great cities, of its terrible tragedies and pathos, of\r\nhow much good there is in the worst, and how much need of courage, and\r\nwhat vast opportunities lie before those who accept the service of man\r\nas their service to God. It proved to me how infinitely more needed\r\nare unselfish deeds than orthodox words, and how much the churches\r\nmust learn from the Labour Party, the Socialist Party, the\r\nTrades-Union, before tens of thousands of our fellow beings, with all\r\ntheir hopes and fears, loves and aspirations, have a fair chance to\r\nmake good. I learned also to hate the liquor traffic with a loathing\r\nof my soul. I met peers of the realm honoured with titles because they\r\nhad grown rich on the degradation of my friends. I saw lives damned,\r\ncruelties of every kind perpetrated, jails and hospitals filled,\r\nmisery, want, starvation, murder, all caused by men who fattened off\r\nthe profits and posed as gentlemen and great people. I have seen men's\r\nmouths closed whose business in life it was to speak out against this\r\naccursed trade. I have seen men driven from the profession of priests\r\nof God, making the Church a stench in the nostrils of men who knew\r\nvalues just as well as those trained in the universities do, all\r\nthrough alcohol, alcohol, alcohol. This awful war has been dragging\r\nits weary course for over four years now, and yet England has not\r\ntackled this curse which is throttling her. We sing \"God save the\r\nKing,\" and pretend to believe in the prayer, and yet we will not face\r\nthis glaring demon in our midst. Words may clothe ideas, but it takes\r\ndeeds to realize them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy parents having gone, it became necessary for me to find\r\nlodgings--which I did, \"unfurnished,\" in the house of a Portuguese\r\nwidow. Her husband, who had a good family name, had gone down in the\r\nworld, and had disappeared with another \"lady.\" The eldest son, a\r\nmathematical genius, had been able to pay his way through Cambridge\r\nUniversity by the scholarships and prizes which he had won. One\r\nbeautiful little dark-eyed daughter of seven was playing in a West End\r\nTheatre as the dormouse in \"Alice in Wonderland.\" She was second\r\nfiddle to Alice herself, also, and could sing all her songs. Her pay\r\nwas some five pounds a week, poor enough for the attraction she\r\nproved, but more than all the rest of the family put together earned.\r\nAt that time I never went to theatres. Acquaintances had persuaded me\r\nthat so many of the girls were ruined on the stage that for a man\r\ntaking any interest in Christian work whatever, it was wrong to\r\nattend. Moreover, among my acquaintances there were not a few theatre\r\nfans, and I had nothing in common with them. The \"dormouse,\" however,\r\nused to come up and say her parts for my benefit, and that of\r\noccasional friends, and was so modest and winsome, and her earnings so\r\ninvaluable to the family, that I entirely altered my opinion. Then and\r\nthere I came to the conclusion that the drama was an essential part of\r\nart, and that those who were trying to elevate and cleanse it, like\r\nSir Henry Irving, whose son I had met at Marlborough, must have the\r\nsupport of a public who demanded clean plays and good conditions both\r\nin front and behind the screen. When I came to London my father had\r\nasked me not to go to anything but Shakespearian or equally\r\nwell-recognized plays until I was twenty-one. Only once did I enter a\r\nmusic hall and I had plenty to satisfy me in a very few minutes.\r\nVaudevilles are better than in those days. The censor does good work,\r\nbut it is still the demand which creates the supply, and whatever\r\nimprovement has occurred has been largely due to the taste of the\r\npatrons. Medical students need all the open air they can get in order\r\nto keep body and soul fit, and our contempt for the theatre fan was\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nMy new lodgings being close to Victoria Park afforded the opportunity\r\nfor training if one were unconventional. To practise throwing the\r\nsixteen-pound hammer requires rough ground and plenty of space, and as\r\nI was scheduled for that at the inter-hospital sports, it was\r\nnecessary to work when not too many disinterested parties were around.\r\nEven an East-Ender's skull is not hammer-proof, as I had seen when a\r\npoor woman was brought into hospital with five circular holes in her\r\nhead, the result of blows inflicted by her husband with a hammer. The\r\nonly excuse which the ruffian offered for the murder was that she had\r\nforgotten to wake him, he had been late, and lost his job.\r\n\r\nA number of the boys in my class were learning to swim. There was only\r\none bathing lake and once the waters were troubled we drew the line at\r\ngoing in to give lessons. So we used to meet at the gate at the hour\r\nof opening in the morning, and thus be going back before most folks\r\nwere moving. Nor did we always wait for the park keeper, but often\r\nscaled the gates and so obtained an even more exclusive dip. Many an\r\nevening we would also \"flannel,\" and train round and round the park,\r\nor Hackney Common, to improve one's wind before some big event. For\r\ndiet at that time I used oatmeal, milk, and eggs, and very little or\r\nno meat. It was cheaper and seemed to give me more endurance; and the\r\nreal value of money was dawning on me.\r\n\r\nVictoria Park is one of those open forums where every man with a sore\r\nspot goes out to air his grievance. On Sundays there were little\r\ngroups around the trees where orators debated on everything from a\r\npatent medicine to the nature of God. Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs.\r\nAnnie Besant were associated together in iconoclastic efforts against\r\northodox religion, and there was so much truth in some of their\r\ncontentions that they were making no little disturbance. Hanging on\r\ntheir skirts were a whole crowd of ignorant, dogmatic atheists, who\r\npublished a paper called \"The Freethinker,\" which, while it was a\r\nvillainous and contemptible rag, appealed to the passions and\r\nprejudices of the partially educated. To answer the specious arguments\r\nof their propaganda an association known as the Christian Evidence\r\nSociety used to send out lecturers. One of them became quite famous\r\nfor his clever arguments and answers, his ready wit, and really\r\nextensive reading. He was an Antiguan, a black man named Edwards, and\r\nhad been a sailor before the mast. I met him at the parish house of an\r\nEpiscopal clergyman of a near-by church, who, under the caption of\r\nChristian socialism, ran all kinds of social agencies that really\r\nfound their way to the hearts of the people. His messages were so much\r\nmore in deeds than in words that he greatly appealed to me, and I\r\ntransferred my allegiance to his church, which was always well filled.\r\nI particularly remember among his efforts the weekly parish dance. My\r\nreligious acquaintances were apt to class all such simple amusements\r\nin a sort of general category as \"works of the Devil,\" and turn deaf\r\nears to every invitation to point out any evil results, being\r\nsatisfied with their own statement that it was the \"thin edge of the\r\nwedge.\" This good man, however, was very obviously driving a wedge\r\ninto the hearts of many of his poor neighbours who in those days found\r\nno opportunity for relief in innocent pleasures from the sordid round\r\nof life in the drab purlieus of Bethnal Green. This clergyman was a\r\nforerunner of his neighbour, the famous Samuel Barnett of Mile End,\r\nwho thought out, started, and for many years presided over Toynbee\r\nHouse, the first big university settlement in East London. His workers\r\npreached their gospel through phrases and creeds which they accepted\r\nwith mental reservations, but just exactly in such ways as they\r\nbelieved in absolutely. At first it used to send a shiver down my\r\nspine to find a church worker who didn't believe in the Creed, and\r\nstumbled over all our fundamentals. At first it amazed me that such\r\nmen would pay their own expenses to live in a place like Whitechapel,\r\nonly to work on drain committees, as delinquent landlord mentors, or\r\njust to give special educational chances to promising minds, or\r\nphysical training to unfit bodies. Yet one saw in their efforts\r\nundeniable messages of real love. Personally I could only occasionally\r\nrun up there to meet friends in residence or attend an art exhibition,\r\nbut they taught me many lessons.\r\n\r\nExactly opposite the hospital was Oxford House, only two minutes\r\ndistant, which combined definite doctrinal religion with social work.\r\nBeing an Oxford effort it had great attractions for me. Moreover,\r\nright alongside it in the middle of a disused sugar refinery I had\r\nhired the yard, converted it into a couple of lawn-tennis courts, and\r\nran a small club. There I first met the famous Dr. Hensley Henson, now\r\nBishop of Hereford, and also the present Bishop of London, Dr.\r\nWinnington-Ingram--a good all-round athlete. He used to visit in our\r\nwards, and as we had a couple of fives courts, a game which takes\r\nlittle tune and gives much exercise, we used to have an afternoon off\r\ntogether, once a week, when he came over to hospital. Neither of these\r\nsplendid men were dignitaries in those days, or I am afraid they would\r\nhave found us medicals much more stand-offish. I may as well admit\r\nthat we had not then learned to have any respect for bishops or church\r\nmagnates generally. We liked both of these men because they were\r\nunconventional and good sports, and especially in that they were not\r\nafraid to tackle the atheist's propaganda in the open. I have seen Dr.\r\nHenson in Whitechapel debating alone against a hall full of opponents\r\nand with a fairness and infinite restraint, convincing those open to\r\nreason that they were mistaken. Moreover, I have seen Dr. Ingram doing\r\njust the same thing standing on a stone in the open park. It may all\r\nsound very silly when one knows that by human minds, or to the human\r\nmind, the Infinite can never be demonstrated as a mathematical\r\nproposition. But the point was that these clergy were proving that\r\nthey were real men--men who had courage as well as faith, who believed\r\nin themselves and their message, who deserved the living which they\r\nwere supposed to make out of orthodoxy. This the audience knew was\r\nmore than could be said of many of the opponents. Christ himself\r\nshowed his superb manhood in just such speaking out.\r\n\r\nIndelibly impressed on my mind still is an occasion when one of the\r\nmost blatant and vicious of these opponents of religion fell ill. A\r\nSalvation Army lass found him deserted and in poverty, nursed and\r\nlooked after him and eventually made a new man of him.\r\n\r\nFar and away the most popular of the Park speakers was the Antiguan.\r\nHis arguments were so clever it was obvious that he was well and\r\nwidely read. His absolute understanding of the crowd and his witty\r\nrepartee used frequently to cause his opponents to lose their tempers,\r\nand that was always their undoing. The crowd as a rule was very fair\r\nand could easily distinguish arguments from abuse. Thus, on one Sunday\r\nthe debate was as to whether nature was God. The atheist\r\nrepresentative was a very loud-voiced demagogue, who when angry\r\nbetrayed his Hibernian origin very markedly. Having been completely\r\nworsted and the laugh turned against him by a clever correction of\r\nsome one's, he used the few minutes given him to reply in violent\r\nabuse, ending up that \"ladies and gentlemen did not come out on\r\nholidays to spend their time being taught English by a damned nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" Edwards answered from the crowd, \"I am a British subject, born\r\non the island of Antigua, and as much an Englishman as any Irishman in\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nEdwards possessed an inexhaustible stock of good-humour and his laugh\r\ncould be heard halfway across the Park. As soon as his turn came to\r\nmount the stone, he got the crowd so good-natured that they became\r\nangry at the interruptions of the enemy, and when some one suggested\r\nthat if nature were that man's God, the near-by duckpond was the\r\nnatural place for him, there was a rush for him, and for several\r\nsubsequent Sundays he was not in evidence. Edwards was a poor man, his\r\nsmall salary and incessant generosity left him nothing for holidays,\r\nand he was killing himself with overwork. So we asked him to join us\r\nin the new house which we were fitting up in Palestine Place. He most\r\ngladly did so and added enormously to our fun. Unfortunately\r\ntuberculosis long ago got its grip upon him, and removed a valuable\r\nlife from East London.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer little beehive in which we lived in those days, and a\r\nmore cosmopolitan crowd could hardly have been found: one young doctor\r\nwho has since made his name and fortune in Australia; another in whose\r\nrooms were nearly a hundred cups for prowess in nearly every form of\r\nathletics, and who also has \"made good\" in professional life, besides\r\nseveral others who for shorter or longer periods were allotted rooms\r\nin our house. Among the more unusual was the \"C.M.,\" a Brahmin from\r\nIndia, a priest in his youth, who had been brought back to England by\r\nsome society to be educated in medical missionary work, but whom for\r\nsome reason they had dropped. For a short time a clever young Russian\r\nof Hebrew extraction who was studying for the Church helped to render\r\nour common-room social engagements almost international affairs.\r\n\r\nAs I write this I am at Charleston, South Carolina, and I see how hard\r\nit will be for an American to understand the possibility of such a\r\nmotley assembly being reasonable or even proper. It seems to me down\r\nhere that there must have been odd feelings sometimes in those days. I\r\ncan only say, however, that I never personally even thought of it.\r\nEast London is so democratic that one's standards are simply those of\r\nthe value of the man's soul as we saw it. If he had been yellow with\r\npink stripes it honestly would not have mattered one iota to most of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that there was at that time in hospital under my care a\r\npatient known as \"the elephant man.\" He had been starring under that\r\ntitle in a cheap vaudeville, had been seen by some of the students,\r\nand invited over to be shown to and studied by our best physicians.\r\nThe poor fellow was really exceedingly sensitive about his most\r\nextraordinary appearance. The disease was called \"leontiasis,\" and\r\nconsisted of an enormous over-development of bone and skin on one\r\nside. His head and face were so deformed as really to resemble a big\r\nanimal's head with a trunk. My arms would not reach around his hat. A\r\nspecial room in a yard was allotted to him, and several famous people\r\ncame to see him--among them Queen Alexandra, then the Princess of\r\nWales, who afterward sent him an autographed photograph of herself.\r\nHe kept it in his room, which was known as the \"elephant house,\" and\r\nit always suggested beauty and the beast. Only at night could the man\r\nventure out of doors, and it was no unusual thing in the dusk of\r\nnightfall to meet him walking up and down in the little courtyard. He\r\nused to talk freely of how he would look in a huge bottle of\r\nalcohol--an end to which in his imagination he was fated to come. He\r\nwas of a very cheerful disposition and pathetically proud of his left\r\nside which was normal. Very suddenly one day he died--the reason\r\nassigned being that his head fell forward and choked him, being too\r\nheavy for him to lift up.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 I passed my examinations and duly became a member of the\r\nCollege of Physicians and of the Royal College of Surgeons of England;\r\nand sought some field for change and rest, where also I could use my\r\nnewly acquired license to my own, if to no one else's, benefit. Among\r\nthe patients who came to the London Hospital, there were now and again\r\nfishermen from the large fishing fleets of the North Sea. They lived\r\nout, as it were, on floating villages, sending their fish to market\r\nevery day by fast cutters. Every two or three months, as their turn\r\ncame round, a vessel would leave for the home port on the east coast,\r\nbeing permitted, or supposed to be permitted, a day at home for each\r\nfull week at sea. As the fleets kept the sea summer and winter and the\r\nboats were small, not averaging over sixty tons, it was a hazardous\r\ncalling. The North Sea is nowhere deeper than thirty fathoms, much of\r\nit being under twenty, and in some places only five. Indeed, it is a\r\nrecently sunken and still sinking portion of Europe, so much so that\r\nthe coasts on both sides are constantly receding, and when Heligoland\r\nwas handed over by the English to the Kaiser, it was said that he\r\nwould have to keep jacking it up or soon there would be none left.\r\nShallow waters exposed to the fierce gales which sweep the German\r\nOcean make deep and dangerous seas, which readily break and wash the\r\ndecks of craft with low freeboard, such as the North Sea vessels are\r\nobliged to have in order to get boats in and out to ferry their fish\r\nto the cutter.\r\n\r\nThere being no skilled aid at hand, the quickest way to get help used\r\nto be to send an injured man to market with the fish. Often it was a\r\nlong journey of many days, simple fractures became compound, and limbs\r\nand faculties were often thus lost. It so happened that Sir Frederick\r\nTreves had himself a love for navigating in small sailing craft. He\r\nhad made it a practice to cross the English Channel to Calais in a\r\nsailing lugger every Boxing Day--that is, the day after Christmas. He\r\nwas especially interested in those \"that go down to the sea in ships\"\r\nand had recently made a trip among the fishing fleets. He told me that\r\na small body of men, interested in the religious and social welfare of\r\nthe deep-sea fishermen, had chartered a small fishing smack, sent her\r\nout among the fishermen to hold religious services of a simple,\r\nunconventional type, in order to afford the men an alternative to the\r\ngrog vessels when fishing was slack, and to carry first aid, the\r\nskipper of the vessel being taught ambulance work. They wanted,\r\nhowever, very much to get a young doctor to go out, who cared also for\r\nthe spiritual side of the work, to see if they could use the\r\nadditional attraction of proper medical aid to gain the men's\r\nsympathies. His advice to me was to go and have a look at it. \"If you\r\ngo in January you will see some fine seascapes, anyhow. Don't go in\r\nsummer when all of the old ladies go for a rest.\"\r\n\r\nI therefore applied to go out the following January, and that fall,\r\nwhile working near the Great London docks, I used often to look at\r\nthe tall East Indiamen, thinking that I soon should be aboard just\r\nsuch a vessel in the North Sea. It was dark and raining when my train\r\nran into Yarmouth, and a dripping, stout fisherman in a blue uniform\r\nmet me at that then unattractive and ill-lighted terminus. He had\r\nbrought a forlorn \"growler\" or four-wheeled cab. Climbing in we drove\r\na mile or more along a deserted road, and drew up at last apparently\r\nat the back of beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the ship?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, those are her topmasts,\" replied my guide, pointing to two posts\r\nprojecting from the sand. \"The tide is low and she is hidden by the\r\nquay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens!\" I thought; \"she's no tea clipper, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nI climbed up the bank and peered down in the darkness at the hull of a\r\nsmall craft, a little larger than our old Roysterer. She was just\r\ndiscernible by the dim rays of the anchor light. I was hesitating as\r\nto whether I shouldn't drive back to Yarmouth and return to London\r\nwhen a cheery voice on deck called out a hearty welcome. What big\r\nthings hang on a smile and a cheery word no man can ever say. But it\r\nbroke the spell this time and I had my cabby unload my bags on the\r\nbank and bade him good-night. As his wheels rumbled away into the rain\r\nand dark, I felt that my cables were cut beyond recall. Too late to\r\nsave me, the cheery voice shouted, \"Mind the rigging, it's just tarred\r\nand greased.\" I was already sliding down and sticking to it as I went.\r\nSmall as the vessel was she was absolutely spotless. Her steward, who\r\ncooked for all hands, was smart and in a snow-white suit. The contrast\r\nbetween-decks and that above was very comforting, though my quarters\r\nwere small. The crew were all stocky, good-humoured, and independent.\r\nDemocratic as East London had made me, they impressed me very\r\nfavourably, and I began to look forward to the venture with real\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nDrink was the worst enemy of these men. The quaysides of the\r\nfisherman's quarters teemed with low saloons. Wages were even paid off\r\nin them or their annexes, and grog vessels, luring the men aboard with\r\ncheap tobacco and low literature, plied their nefarious calling with\r\nthe fleets, and were the death, body and soul, of many of these fine\r\nspecimens of manhood.\r\n\r\nThere was never any question as to the real object of the Mission to\r\nDeep-Sea Fishermen. The words \"Heal the sick\" carved in large letters\r\nadorned the starboard bow. \"Preach the Word\" was on the port, and\r\naround the brass rim of the wheel ran the legend, \"Jesus said, Follow\r\nme and I will make you fishers of men.\" Thirty years ago we were more\r\nconventional than to-day, and I was much surprised to learn from our\r\nskipper that we were bound to Ostend to ship four tons of tobacco,\r\nsent over from England for us in bond, as he might not take it out\r\nconsigned to the high seas. In Belgium, however, no duty was paid. The\r\nonly trouble was that our vessel, to help pay its expenses, carried\r\nfishing gear, and as a fishing vessel could not get a clearance in\r\nBelgium. Our nets and beams, therefore, had to go out to the fishing\r\ngrounds in a friendly trawler while we passed as a mercantile marine\r\nduring the time we took on our cargo.\r\n\r\nSo bitter was the cold that in the harbour we got frozen in and were\r\nable to skate up the canals. We had eventually to get a steamer to go\r\naround us and smash our ice bonds when we were again ready for sea.\r\nDuring the next two months we saw no land except Heligoland and\r\nTerschelling--or Skilling, as the fishermen called it--far away in\r\nthe offing. Nor was our deck once clear of ice and snow during all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOur duty was to visit as many fleets as we could, and arrange with\r\nsome reliable vessel to take a stock of tobacco for the use of their\r\nspecial fleet. The ship was to carry about six feet of blue bunting on\r\nher foretopmast stay, a couple of fathoms above her bowsprit end, so\r\nthat all the fleet might know her. She was to sell the tobacco at a\r\nfixed price that just covered the cost, and undersold the \"coper\" by\r\nfifty per cent. She was to hoist her flag for business every morning,\r\nwhile the small boats were out boarding fish on the carrier, and was\r\nto lie as far to leeward of the coper as possible so that the men\r\ncould not go to both. Nineteen such floating depots were eventually\r\narranged for, with the precaution that if any one of them had to\r\nreturn to port, he should bring no tobacco home, but hand over his\r\nstock and accounts to a reliable friend.\r\n\r\nThese deep-sea fisheries were a revelation to me, and every hour of\r\nthe long trip I enjoyed. It was amazing to me to find over twenty\r\nthousand men and boys afloat--the merriest, cheerfullest lot which I\r\nhad ever met. They were hail-fellow-well-met with every one, and never\r\nthought of deprivation or danger. Clothing, food, customs, were all\r\nsubordinated to utility. They were the nearest possible thing to a\r\ncommunity of big boys, only needing a leader. In efficiency and for\r\ntheir daring resourcefulness in physical difficulties and dangers,\r\nthey were absolutely in a class by themselves, embodying all the\r\ntraits of character which make men love to read the stories of the\r\nbuccaneers and other seamen of the sixteenth-century period.\r\n\r\nEach fleet had its admiral and vice-admiral, appointed partly by the\r\nowner, and partly by the skippers of the vessels. The devil-may-care\r\nspirit was always a great factor with the men. The admiral directed\r\noperations by flags in the daytime and by rockets at night, thus\r\nindicating what the fleet was to do and where they were to fish.\r\nGenerally he had the fastest boat, and the cutters, hunting for the\r\nfleet always lay just astern of the admiral, the morning after their\r\narrival. Hundreds of men would come for letters, packages, to load\r\nfish, to get the news of what their last assignment fetched in market.\r\nMoreover, a kind of Parliament was held aboard to consider policies\r\nand hear complaints.\r\n\r\nAt first it was a great surprise to me how these men knew where they\r\nwere, for we never saw anything but sky and sea, and not even the\r\nadmirals carried a chronometer or could work out a longitude; and only\r\na small percentage of the skippers could read or write. They all,\r\nhowever, carried a sextant and could by rule of thumb find a latitude\r\nroughly. But that was only done at a pinch. The armed lead was the\r\nfisherman's friend. It was a heavy lead with a cup on the bottom\r\nfilled fresh each time with sticky grease. When used, the depth was\r\nalways called out by the watch, and the kind of sand, mud, or rock\r\nwhich stuck to the grease shown to the skipper. \"Fifteen fathoms and\r\ncoffee grounds--must be on the tail end of the Dogger. Put her a bit\r\nmore to the westward, boy,\" he would remark, and think no more about\r\nit, though he might have been three or four days looking for his\r\nfleet, and not spoken to a soul since he left land. I remember one\r\nskipper used to have the lead brought down below, and he could tell by\r\nthe grit between his teeth after a couple of soundings which way to\r\nsteer. It sounds strange even now, but it was so universal, being just\r\nsecond-nature to the men, who from boyhood had lived on the sea, that\r\nwe soon ceased to marvel at it. Skippers were only just being obliged\r\nto have certificates. These they obtained by _viva voce_ examinations.\r\nYou would sometimes hear an aspiring student, a great black-bearded\r\npirate over forty-seven inches around the chest, and possibly the\r\nfather of eight or ten children, as he stamped about in his watch\r\nkeeping warm, repeating the courses--\"East end of the Dogger to Horn\r\nS.E. by E. ½ and W. point of the island [Heligoland] to Barkum S. ½ W.\r\nOwer Light to Hazebrough N.N.W.\"--and so on. Their memories were not\r\nburdened by a vast range of facts, but in these things they were the\r\nnearest imaginable to Blind Tom, the famous slave musician.\r\n\r\nOur long round only occupied us about a month, and after that we\r\nsettled down with the fleet known as the Great Northerners. Others\r\nwere the Short Blues, the Rashers (because they were streaked like a\r\npiece of bacon), the Columbia, the Red Cross, and so on. Sometimes\r\nduring the night while we were fishing into the west, a hundred sail\r\nor more of vessels, we would pass through another big fleet coming the\r\nother way, and some of our long trawls and warps would tangle with\r\ntheirs. Beyond the beautiful spectacle of the myriads of lights\r\nbobbing up and down often enough on mighty rough seas--for it needed\r\ngood breezes to haul our trawls--would be the rockets and flares of\r\nthe entangled boats, and often enough also rockets and flares from\r\nfriends, and from cutters. One soon became so friendly with the men\r\nthat one would not return at night to the ship, but visit around and\r\nrejoin the Mission ship boarding fish next day, to see patients coming\r\nfor aid. Though it was strictly against sea rules for skippers to be\r\noff their vessels all night, that was a rule, like all others on the\r\nNorth Sea, as often marked in the breach as in the observance. A\r\ngoodly company would get together yarning and often singing and\r\nplaying games until it was time to haul the trawl and light enough to\r\nfind their own vessel and signal for the boat.\r\n\r\nThe relation of my new friends to religion was a very characteristic\r\none. Whatever they did, they did hard. Thus one of the admirals, being\r\na thirsty soul, and the grog vessels having been adrift for a longer\r\nwhile than he fancied, conceived the fine idea of holding up the\r\nHeligoland saloons. So one bright morning he \"hove his fleet to\" under\r\nthe lee of the island and a number of boats went ashore, presumably to\r\nsell fish. Altogether they landed some five hundred men, who held up\r\nthe few saloons for two or three days. As a result subsequently only\r\none crew selling fish to the island was allowed ashore at one time.\r\nThe very gamble of their occupation made them do things hard. Thus it\r\nwas a dangerous task to throw out a small boat in half a gale of wind,\r\nfill her up with heavy boxes of fish, and send her to put these over\r\nthe rail of a steamer wallowing in the trough of a mountainous sea.\r\n\r\nBut it was on these very days when less fish was sent to market that\r\nthe best prices were realized, and so there were always a number of\r\ndare-devils, who did not care if lives were lost so long as good\r\nprices were obtained and their record stood high on the weekly list of\r\nsales which was forwarded to both owners and men. I have known as many\r\nas fourteen men upset in one morning out of these boats; and the\r\nannual loss of some three hundred and fifty men was mostly from this\r\ncause. Conditions were subsequently improved by the Board of Trade,\r\nwho made it manslaughter against the skipper if any man was drowned\r\nboarding fish, unless the admiral had shown his flags to give the\r\nfleet permission to do so. In those days, however, I often saw twenty\r\nto thirty boats all tied up alongside the cutter at one time, the\r\nheavy seas every now and again rolling the cutter's sail right under\r\nwater, and when she righted again it might come up under the keels of\r\nsome of the boats and tip them upside down. Thus any one in them was\r\ncaught like a mouse under a trap or knocked to pieces trying to swim\r\namong the rushing, tossing boats.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we hauled at midnight, and it was always a fresh source of\r\nwonder, for the trawl was catholic in its embrace and brought up\r\nanything that came in its way. To emphasize how comparatively recently\r\nthe Channel had been dry land, many teeth and tusks of mammoths who\r\nused to roam its now buried forests were given up to the trawls by the\r\never-shifting sands. Old wreckage of every description, ancient\r\ncrockery, and even a water-logged, old square-rigger that must have\r\nsunk years before were brought one day as far as the surface by the\r\nstout wire warp. After the loss of a large steamer called the Elbe\r\nmany of the passengers who had been drowned were hauled up in this\r\nway; and on one occasion great excitement was caused in Hull by a\r\nfisher lad from that port being picked up with his hands tied behind\r\nhis back and a heavy weight on his feet. The defence was that the boy\r\nhad died, and was thus buried to save breaking the voyage--supported\r\nby the fact that another vessel had also picked up the boy and thrown\r\nhim overboard again for the same reason. But those who were a bit\r\nsuperstitious thought otherwise, and more especially as cruelty to\r\nthese boys was not unknown.\r\n\r\nThese lads were apprenticed to the fishery masters largely from\r\nindustrial or reformatory schools, had no relations to look after\r\nthem, and often no doubt gave the limit of trouble and irritation. On\r\nthe whole, however, the system worked well, and a most excellent class\r\nof capable seamen was developed. At times, however, they were badly\r\nexploited. During their apprenticeship years they were not entitled to\r\npay, only to pocket money, and yet sometimes the whole crew including\r\nthe skipper were apprentices and under twenty-one years of age. Even\r\nafter that they were fitted for no other calling but to follow the\r\nsea, and had to accept the master's terms. There were no fishermen's\r\nunions, and the men being very largely illiterate were often left\r\nvictims of a peonage system in spite of the Truck Acts. The master of\r\na vessel has to keep discipline, especially in a fleet, and the best\r\nof boys have faults and need punishing while on land. These skippers\r\nthemselves were brought up in a rough school, and those who fell\r\nvictims to drink and made the acquaintance of the remedial measures of\r\nour penal system of that day were only further brutalized by it.\r\nReligion scarcely touched the majority; for their brief periods of\r\nleave ashore were not unnaturally spent in having a good time. To\r\nthose poisoned by the villainous beverages sold on the sordid grog\r\nvessels no excess was too great. Owners were in sympathy with the\r\nMission in trying to oust the coper, because their property, in the\r\nform of fish, nets, stores, and even sails, were sometimes bartered on\r\nthe high seas for liquor. On one occasion during a drunken quarrel in\r\nthe coper's cabin one skipper threw the kerosene lamp over another\r\nlying intoxicated on the floor. His heavy wool jersey soaked in\r\nkerosene caught fire. He rushed for the deck, and then, a dancing mass\r\nof flames, leaped overboard and disappeared.\r\n\r\nOccasionally skippers devised punishments with a view to remedying the\r\ndefects of character. Thus one lad, who through carelessness had on\r\nmore than one occasion cooked the \"duff\" for dinner badly, was made to\r\ntake his cinders on deck when it was his time to turn in, and go\r\nforward to the fore-rigging. Then he had to take one cinder, go up to\r\nthe cross-tree, and throw it over into the sea, come down the opposite\r\nrigging and repeat the act until he had emptied his scuttle. Another\r\nwho had failed to clean the cabin properly had one night, instead of\r\ngoing to bed, to take a bucketful of sea water and empty it with a\r\nteaspoon into another, and so to and fro until morning. On one\r\noccasion a poor boy was put under the ballast deck, that is, the cabin\r\nfloor, and forgotten. He was subsequently found dead, drowned in the\r\nbilge water. It was easy to hide the results of cruelty, for being\r\nwashed overboard was by no means an uncommon way of disappearing from\r\nvessels with low freeboards in the shallow water of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nA very practical outcome in the mission work was the organization of\r\nthe Fisher Lads' Letter-Writing Association. The members accepted so\r\nmany names of orphan lads at sea and pledged themselves to write\r\nregularly to them. Also, if possible, they were to look them up when\r\nthey returned to land, and indeed do for them much as the War Camp\r\nCommunity League members are to-day trying to accomplish for our\r\nsoldiers and sailors. As every practical exposition of love must, it\r\nmet with a very real response, and brought, moreover, new interests\r\nand joys into many selfish lives.\r\n\r\nI remember one lady whose whole care in life had been her own health.\r\nShe had nursed it, and worried over it, and enjoyed ill health so\r\nlong, that only the constant recourse to the most refined stimulants\r\npostponed the end which would have been a merciful relief--to others.\r\nThe effort of letter-writing remade her. Doctors were forgotten,\r\nstimulants were tabooed, the insignia of invalidism banished, and to\r\nmy intense surprise I ran across her at a fishing port surrounded by a\r\nbevy of blue-jerseyed lads, who were some of those whom she was being\r\nblessed by helping.\r\n\r\nThe best of efforts, however, sometimes \"gang aft agley.\" One day I\r\nreceived a letter, evidently written in great consternation, from an\r\nelderly spinster of singularly aristocratic connections and an\r\nirreproachableness of life which was almost painful. The name sent to\r\nher by one of our skippers as a correspondent who needed help and\r\nencouragement was one of those which would be characterized as\r\ncommon--let us say John Jones. By some perverse fate the wrong ship\r\nwas given as an address, and the skipper of it happened to have\r\nexactly the same name. It appeared that lack of experience in just\r\nsuch work had made her letter possibly more affectionate than she\r\nwould have wished for under the circumstances which developed. For in\r\nwriting to me she enclosed a ferocious letter from a lady of\r\nBillingsgate threatening, not death, but mutilation, if she continued\r\nmaking overtures to \"her John.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNORTH SEA WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at length upon the experiences of the North Sea, because\r\ntrivial as they appear on the surface, they concern the biggest\r\nproblem of human life--the belief that man is not of the earth, but\r\nonly a temporary sojourner upon it. This belief, that he is destined\r\nto go on living elsewhere, makes a vast difference to one's estimate\r\nof values. Life becomes a school instead of a mere stage, the object\r\nof which is that our capacities for usefulness should develop through\r\nusing them until we reach graduation. What life gives to us can only\r\nbe of permanent importance as it develops our souls, thus enabling us\r\nto give more back to it, and leaves us better prepared for any\r\nopportunities than may lie beyond this world. The most valuable asset\r\nfor this assumption is love for the people among whom one lives.\r\n\r\nThe best teachers in life are far from being those who know most, or\r\nwho think themselves wisest. Show me a schoolmaster who does not love\r\nhis boys and you show me one who is of no use. Our faith in our\r\nsonship of God is immensely strengthened by the puzzling fact that\r\neven God cannot force goodness into us, His sons, because we share His\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThese convictions, anyhow, were the mental assets with which I had to\r\nbegin work, and no others. A scientific training had impressed upon me\r\nthat big and little are very relative terms; that one piece of work\r\nbecomes unexpectedly permanent and big, while that which appears to be\r\ngreat, but is merely diffuse, will be temporary and ineffective.\r\nExperience has taught me that one human life has its limits of direct\r\nimpetus, but that its most lasting value is its indirect influence.\r\nThe greatest Life ever lived was no smaller for being in a carpenter's\r\nshop, and largely spent among a few ignorant fishermen. The Scarabee\r\nhad a valid _apologia pro vita sua_ in spite of Dr. Holmes. Tolstoy on\r\nhis farm, Milton without his sight, Bunyan in his prison, Pasteur in\r\nhis laboratory, all did great things for the world.\r\n\r\nThere is so much that is manly about the lives of those who follow the\r\nsea, so much less artificiality than in many other callings, and with\r\nour fishermen so many fewer of what we call loosely \"chances in life,\"\r\nthat to sympathize with them was easy--and sympathy is a long step\r\ntoward love. Life at sea also gives time and opportunity for really\r\nknowing a man. It breaks down conventional barriers, and indeed almost\r\ncompels fellowship and thus an intelligent understanding of the\r\ndifficulties and tragedies of the soul of our neighbour. That rare\r\nfaculty of imagination which is the inspiration of all great lovers of\r\nmen is not alone indispensable. Hand in hand with this inevitably goes\r\nthe vision of one's own opportunity to help and not to hinder others,\r\neven though it be through the unattractive medium of the collection\r\nbox--for that gives satisfaction only in proportion to the sacrifice\r\nwhich we make.\r\n\r\nIn plain words the field of work offered me was attractive. It seemed\r\nto promise me the most remunerative returns for my abilities, or, to\r\nput it in another way, it aroused my ambitions sufficiently to make me\r\nbelieve that my special capacities and training could be used to make\r\nnew men as well as new bodies. Any idea of sacrifice was balanced by\r\nthe fact that I never cared very much for the frills of life so long\r\nas the necessities were forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe attention that Harold Begbie's book \"Twice-Born Men\" received, was\r\nto me later in life a source of surprise. One forgets that the various\r\nreligions and sects which aimed at the healing of men's souls have\r\nconcerned themselves more with intellectual creeds than material,\r\nChrist-like ends. At first it was not so. Paul rejoiced that he was a\r\nnew man. There can be no question but that the Gospels show us truly\r\nthat the change in Christ's first followers was from men, the slaves\r\nof every ordinary human passion, into men who were self-mastered--that\r\nChrist taught by what he was and did rather than by insistence on\r\ncreeds and words. It has been seeing these changes in men's lives, not\r\nonly in their surroundings, though those improve immediately, that\r\nreconcile one to our environment, and has induced me to live a\r\nlife-time in the wilds.\r\n\r\nAnother movement that was just starting at this time also interested\r\nme considerably. A number of keen young men from Oxford and Cambridge,\r\nhaving experienced the dangers that beset boys from big English public\r\nschools who enter the universities without any definite help as to\r\ntheir attitude toward the spiritual relationships of life, got\r\ntogether to discuss the question. They recognized that the formation\r\nof the Boys' Brigade in our conservative social life only touched the\r\nyouth of the poorer classes. Like our English Y.M.C.A., it was not\r\nthen aristocratic enough for gentlemen. They saw, however, that\r\nathletic attainments carried great weight, and that all outdoor\r\naccomplishments had a strong attraction for boys from every class.\r\nThus it happened that an organization called the Public School Camps\r\ncame into being. Its ideal was the uplift of character, and the\r\nmovement has grown with immense strides on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of my summer holidays during these years was spent as\r\nmedical officer at one of these camps. For many reasons it was wise in\r\nEngland to run them on military lines, for besides the added dignity,\r\nit insured the ability to maintain order and discipline. Some\r\nwell-known commandant was chosen who was a soldier also in the good\r\nfight of faith. Special sites were selected, generally on the grounds\r\nof some big country seat which were loaned by the interested lord of\r\nthe manor, and every kind of outdoor attraction was provided which\r\ncould be secured. Besides organized competitive games, there was\r\nusually a yacht, good bathing, always a gymkhana, and numerous\r\nexpeditions and \"hikes.\" Not a moment was left unoccupied. All of the\r\nwork of the camp was done by the boys, who served in turn on orderly\r\nduty. The officers were always, if possible, prominent athletes, to\r\nwhom the boys could look up as being capable in physical as well as\r\nspiritual fields. There was a brief address each night before \"taps\"\r\nin the big marquee used for mess; and one night was always a straight\r\ntalk on the problems of sex by the medical officers, whom the boys\r\nwere advised to consult in their perplexities. These camps were among\r\nthe happiest memories of my life, and many of the men to-day\r\ngratefully acknowledge that the camps were the turning-point of their\r\nwhole lives. The secret was unconventionality and absolute naturalness\r\nwith no \"shibboleths.\" The boys were allowed to be boys absolutely in\r\nan atmosphere of sincere if not omniscient fervour. On one occasion\r\nwhen breaking up camp, a curly-headed young rascal in my tent, being\r\nlate on the last morning--unknown to any one--went to the train in his\r\npajamas, hidden only by his raincoat. At a small wayside station over\r\na hundred miles from London, whither he was bound, leaving his coat in\r\nthe carriage, he ventured into the refreshment stall of the\r\nwaiting-room. Unfortunately, however, he came out only to find his\r\ntrain departed and himself in his nightclothes on the platform without\r\na penny, a ticket, or a friend. Eluding the authorities he reached the\r\nhuge Liverpool terminus by night to find a faithful friend waiting on\r\nthe platform for him with the sorely needed overgarment.\r\n\r\nNo one was ever ashamed to be a Christian, or of what Christ was, or\r\nwhat he did and stood for. However, to ignore the fact that the mere\r\nword \"missionary\" aroused suspicion in the average English\r\nunconventional mind--such as those of these clean, natural-minded\r\nboys--would be a great mistake. Unquestionably, as in the case of\r\nDickens, a missionary was unpractical if not hypocritical, and mildly\r\nincompetent if not secretly vicious. I found myself always fighting\r\nagainst the idea that I was termed a missionary. The men I loved and\r\nadmired, especially such men as those on our athletic teams, felt\r\nreally strongly about it. Henry Martyn--as a scholar--was a hero to\r\nthose who read of him, though few did. Moreover, who does not love\r\nCharles Kingsley? Even as boys, we want to be \"a man,\" though Kingsley\r\nwas a \"Parson Lot.\" It always seemed that a missionary was naturally\r\ndiscounted until he had proved his right to be received as an ordinary\r\nbeing. Once after being the guest of a bank president, he told me that\r\nmy stay was followed by that of their bishop, who was a person of\r\ngreat importance. When the bishop had gone, he asked his two boys one\r\nday. \"Well, which do you like best, the bishop or the doctor?\" \"Ach,\"\r\nwas the reply, \"the bishop can't stand on his head.\" On another\r\noccasion during a visit--while lecturing on behalf of the\r\nfishermen--and doing my usual evening physical drill in my bedroom,\r\nby a great mischance I missed a straight-arm-balance on a chair, fell\r\nover, and nearly brought the chandelier of the drawing-room down on\r\nthe heads of some guests. That a so-called \"missionary\" should be so\r\nworldly as to wish to keep his body fit seemed so unusual that I heard\r\nof that trifle a hundred times.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Christ that is coming will be interested in the forces\r\nthat make for peace and righteousness in this world rather than in\r\nacademic theories as to how to get rewards in another. That will be a\r\nreal stimulus to fitness and capacity all round instead of a dope for\r\nfailures. It is that element in missions to-day, such as the\r\nup-to-date work of the Rockefeller Institute and other medical\r\nmissions in China and India, which alone holds the respect of the mass\r\nof the people. The value of going out merely to make men of different\r\nraces think as we think is being proportionately discounted with the\r\nincrease of education.\r\n\r\nOur North Sea work grew apace. Vessel after vessel was added to the\r\nfleet. Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, became interested, and besides\r\nsubscribing personally toward the first hospital boat, permitted it to\r\nbe named in her honour. According to custom the builders had a\r\nbeautiful little model made which Her Majesty agreed to accept. It was\r\ndecided that it should be presented to her in Buckingham Palace by the\r\ntwo senior mission captains.\r\n\r\nThe journey to them was a far more serious undertaking than a winter\r\nvoyage on the Dogger Bank. However, arrayed in smart blue suits and\r\nnew guernseys and polished to the last degree, they set out on the\r\neventful expedition. On their return every one was as anxious to know\r\n\"how the voyage had turned out\" as if they had been exploring new\r\nfishing grounds around the North Cape in the White Sea. \"Nothing to\r\ncomplain of, boys, till just as we had her in the wind's eye to shoot\r\nthe gear,\" said the senior skipper. \"A big swell in knee-breeches\r\nopened the door and called out our names, when I was brought up all\r\nstanding, for I saw that the peak halliard was fast on the port side.\r\nThe blame thing was too small for me to shift over, so I had to leave\r\nit. But, believe me, she never said a word about it. That's what I\r\ncall something of a lady.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time we had begun two new ventures, an institute at Yarmouth\r\nfor fishermen ashore and a dispensary vessel to be sent out each\r\nspring among the thousands of Scotch, Manx, Irish, and French\r\nfishermen, who carried on the herring and mackerel fishery off the\r\nsouth and west coast of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe south Irish spring fishery is wonderfully interesting. Herring and\r\nmackerel are in huge shoals anywhere from five to forty miles off the\r\nland, and the vessels run in and out each day bringing back the catch\r\nof the night. Each vessel shoots out about two miles of net, while\r\nsome French ones will shoot out five miles. Thus the aggregate of nets\r\nused would with ease stretch from Ireland to New York and back. Yet\r\nthe undaunted herring return year after year to the disastrous\r\nrendezvous. The vessels come from all parts. Many are the large\r\ntan-sailed luggers from the Scottish coasts, their sails and hulls\r\nmarked \"B.F.\" for Banff, \"M.E.\" for Montrose, \"C.N.\" for Campbelltown,\r\netc. With these come the plucky little Ulster boats from Belfast and\r\nLarne, Loch Swilly and Loch Foyle; and not a few of the hereditary\r\nseafaring men from Cornwall, Devon, and Dorset. Others also come from\r\nFalmouth, Penzance, and Exmouth. Besides these are the Irish\r\nboats--few enough, alas, for Paddy is not a sailor. A good priest had\r\ntried to induce his people to share this rich harvest by starting a\r\nfishery school for boys at Baltimore, where net-making and every other\r\nbranch of the industry was taught. It was to little purpose, for I\r\nhave met men hungry on the west coast, who were trying to live on\r\npotato-raising on that bog land who were graduates of Father D.'s\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThere was one year when we ourselves were trying out the trawling in\r\nClew Bay and Blacksod, and getting marvellous catches; so much so that\r\nI remember one small trawler from Grimsby on the east coast of England\r\nmaking two thousand dollars in two days' work, while the Countess of\r\nZ. fund was distributing charity to the poverty-stricken men who lived\r\naround the bay itself. The Government of Ireland also made serious\r\nefforts to make its people take up the fishery business. About one\r\nmillion dollars obtained out of the escheated funds of the Church of\r\nEngland in Ireland, when that organization was disestablished by Mr.\r\nGladstone, was used as a loan fund which was available for fishermen,\r\nresident six months, at two per cent interest. They were permitted to\r\npurchase their own boat and gear for the fishery out of the money thus\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay in Durham Harbour at the entrance to Waterford Harbour,\r\nwe met many Cornishmen who were temporarily resident there, having\r\ncome over from Cornwall to qualify for borrowing the money to get\r\nboats and outfit. During one week in which we were working from that\r\nport, there were so many saints' days on which the Irish crews would\r\nnot go out fishing, but were having good times on the land, that the\r\nskippers, who were Cornishmen, had to form a crew out of their own\r\nnumbers and take one of their boats to sea.\r\n\r\nOne day we had landed on the Arran Islands, and I was hunting ferns in\r\nthe rock crevices, for owing to the warmth of the Gulf current the\r\ngrowth is luxuriant. On the top of the cliffs about three hundred feet\r\nhigh, I fell in with two Irishmen smoking their pipes and sprawling on\r\nthe edge of the precipice. The water below was very deep and they were\r\nfishing. I had the fun of seeing dangling codfish hauled leisurely up\r\nall that long distance, and if one fell off on the passage, it was\r\namusing to note the absolute insouciance of the fishermen, who assured\r\nme that there were plenty more in the sea.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a puzzle to me why so few tourists and yachtsmen\r\nvisit the south and west coast of Ireland. Its marvellous wild, rock\r\nscenery, its exquisite bays,--no other words describe them,--its\r\nemerald verdure, and its interesting and hospitable people have given\r\nme, during the spring fishing seasons that I spent on that coast, some\r\nof the happiest memories of my life. On the contrary, most of the\r\nyachts hang around the Solent, and the piers of Ryde, Cowes, and\r\nSouthampton, instead of the magnificent coast from Queenstown to\r\nDonegal Cliffs, and from there all along West Scotland to the\r\nHebrides.\r\n\r\nAbout this time our work established a dispensary and social centre at\r\nCrookhaven, just inside the Fastnet Lighthouse, and another in Tralee\r\non the Kerry coast, north of Cape Clear. Gatherings for worship and\r\nsinging were also held on Sundays on the boats, for on that day\r\nneither Scotch, Manx, nor English went fishing. The men loved the\r\nmusic, the singing of hymns, and the conversational addresses. Many\r\nwould take some part in the service, and my memories of those\r\ngatherings are still very pleasant ones.\r\n\r\nOn this wild coast calls for help frequently came from the poor\r\nsettlers as well as from the seafarers. A summons coming in one day\r\nfrom the Fastnet Light, we rowed out in a small boat to that lovely\r\nrock in the Atlantic. A heavy sea, however, making landing impossible,\r\nwe caught hold of a buoy, anchored off from the rock, and then rowing\r\nin almost to the surf, caught a line from the high overhanging crane.\r\nA few moments later one was picked out of the tumbling, tossing boat\r\nlike a winkle out of a shell, by a noose at the end of a line from a\r\ncrane a hundred and fifty feet above, swung perpendicularly up into\r\nthe air, and then round and into a trap-door in the side of the\r\nlighthouse. On leaving one was swung out again in the same fashion,\r\nand dangled over the tumbling boat until caught and pulled in by the\r\noarsmen.\r\n\r\nAnother day we rowed out nine miles in an Irish craft to visit the\r\nSkerry Islands, famous for the old Beehive Monastery, and the\r\ncountless nests of gannets and other large sea-birds. The cliffs rise\r\nto a great height almost precipitously, and the ceaseless thunder of\r\nthe Atlantic swell jealously guards any landing. There being no davit\r\nor crane, we had just to fling ourselves into the sea, and climb up as\r\nbest we could, carrying a line to haul up our clothing from the boat\r\nand other apparatus after landing, while the oarsmen kept her outside\r\nthe surf. To hold on to the slippery rock we needed but little\r\nclothing, anyhow, for it was a slow matter, and the clinging power of\r\none's bare toes was essential. The innumerable gannets sitting on\r\ntheir nests gave the island the appearance of a snowdrift; and we soon\r\nhad all the eggs that we needed lowered by a line. But some of the\r\ngulls, of whose eggs we wanted specimens also, built so cleverly onto\r\nthe actual faces of the cliffs, that we had to adopt the old plan of\r\nhanging over the edge and raising the eggs on the back of one's foot,\r\nwhich is an exploit not devoid of excitement. The chief difficulty\r\nwas, however, with one of our number, who literally stuck on the top,\r\nbeing unable to descend, at least in a way compatible with comfort or\r\nsafety. The upshot was that he had to be blindfolded and helped.\r\n\r\nOne of our Council, being connected at this time with the Irish\r\nPoor-Relief Board and greatly interested in the Government efforts to\r\nrelieve distress in Ireland, arranged that we should make a voyage\r\naround the entire island in one of our vessels, trying the trawling\r\ngrounds everywhere, and also the local markets available for making\r\nour catch remunerative. There has been considerable activity in these\r\nwaters of late years, but it was practically pioneer work in those\r\ndays, the fishery being almost entirely composed of drift nets and\r\nlong lines. It was supposed that the water was too deep and the bottom\r\ntoo uneven and rocky to make trawling possible. We had only a sailing\r\nvessel of about sixty tons, and the old heavy beam trawl, for the\r\nother trawl and steam fishing boats were then quite in their infancy.\r\nThe quantity and variety of victims that came to our net were\r\nprodigious, and the cruise has remained as a dream in my memory,\r\ncombined as it was with so many chances of helping out one of the most\r\ninteresting and amiable--if not educated--peoples in the world. It\r\nhappened to be a year of potato scarcity; as one friend pointed out,\r\nthere was a surplus of Murphys in the kitchen and a scarcity of\r\nMurphys in the cellar--\"Murphys\" being another name for that vegetable\r\nwhich is so large a factor in Irish economic life. As mentioned\r\nbefore, a fund, called the Countess of Z.'s fund, had been established\r\nto relieve the consequent distress, and while we were fishing in Black\r\nSod Bay, the natives around the shore were accepting all that they\r\ncould secure. Yet one steam trawler cleared four hundred pounds\r\nwithin a week; and our own fine catches, taken in so short a while,\r\nmade it seem a veritable fishermen's paradise for us, who were\r\naccustomed to toil over the long combers and stormy banks of the North\r\nSea. The variety of fish taken alone made the voyage of absorbing\r\ninterest, numbering cod, haddock, ling, hake, turbot, soles, plaice,\r\nhalibut, whiting, crayfish, shark, dog-fish, and many quaint monsters\r\nunmarketable then, but perfectly edible. Among those taken in was the\r\nbig angler fish, which lives at the bottom with his enormous mouth\r\nopen, dangling an attractive-looking bait formed by a long rod growing\r\nout from his nose, which lures small victims into the cavern, whence,\r\nas he possesses row upon row of spiky teeth which providentially point\r\ndown his throat, there is seldom any returning.\r\n\r\nAmong the many memories of that coast which gave me a vision of the\r\nland question as it affected the people in those days, one in\r\nparticular has always remained with me. We had made a big catch in a\r\ncertain bay, a perfectly beautiful inlet. To see if the local\r\nfishermen could find a market within reach of these fishing grounds,\r\nwith one of the crew, and the fish packed in boxes, we sailed up the\r\ninlet to the market town of Bell Mullet. Being Saturday, we found a\r\nmarket day in progress, and buyers, who, encouraged by one of the new\r\nGovernment light railways, were able to purchase our fish. That\r\nevening, however, when halfway home, a squall suddenly struck our own\r\nlightened boat, which was rigged with one large lugsail, and capsized\r\nher. By swimming and manoeuvring the boat, we made land on the low,\r\nmuddy flats. No house was in sight, and it was not until long after\r\ndark that we two shivering masses of mud reached an isolated cabin in\r\nthe middle of a patch of the redeemed ground right in the centre of a\r\nlarge bog. A miserably clad woman greeted us with a warm Irish\r\nwelcome. The house had only one room and accommodated the live-stock\r\nas well as the family. A fine cow stood in one corner; a donkey tied\r\nto the foot of the bed was patiently looking down into the face of the\r\nbaby. Father was in England harvesting. A couple of pigs lay under the\r\nbed, and the floor space was still further encroached upon by a goodly\r\nnumber of chickens, which were encouraged by the warmth of the peat\r\nfire. They not only thought it their duty to emphasize our welcome,\r\nbut--misled by the firelight--were saluting the still far-off dawn.\r\nThe resultant emotions which we experienced during the night led us to\r\nsuggest that we might assist toward the erection of a cattle pen.\r\nBefore leaving, however, we were told, \"Shure t' rint would be raised\r\nin the fall,\" if such signs of prosperity as farm buildings greeted\r\nthe land agent's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of Loch Foyle, one of the most beautiful bays in Ireland,\r\ngave us a fine return in fish. Especially I remember the magnificent\r\nturbot which we took off the wild shore between the frowning basalt\r\ncliffs of the Giant's Causeway, and the rough headlands of Loch\r\nSwilly. We sold our fish in the historic town of Londonderry, where we\r\nsaw the old gun Mons Meg, which once so successfully roared for King\r\nWilliam, still in its place on the old battlements. By a packet\r\nsteamer plying to Glasgow, we despatched some of the catch to that\r\ngreedy market. At Loch Foyle there is a good expanse of sandy and mud\r\nbottom which nurses quite a harvest of the sea, though--oddly\r\nenough--close by off Rathlin Island is the only water over one hundred\r\nfathoms deep until the Atlantic Basin is reached. The Irish Sea like\r\nthe North Sea is all shallow water. Crossing to the Isle of Man, we\r\ndelayed there only a short while, for those grounds are well known to\r\nthe Fleetwood trawlers, who supply so much fish to the dense\r\npopulation of North Central England. We found little opportunity of\r\ntrawling off the west of Scotland, the ocean's bottom being in no way\r\nsuited to it. On reaching the Western Hebrides, however, we were once\r\nmore among many old friends. From Stornaway on the Isle of Lewis alone\r\nsome nine hundred drifters were pursuing the retreating armies of\r\nherring.\r\n\r\nThe German hordes have taught us to think of life in large numbers,\r\nbut were the herring to elect a Kaiser, he would dominate in reality\r\nan absolutely indestructible host. For hundreds of years fishermen of\r\nall countries have without cessation been pursuing these friends of\r\nmankind. For centuries these inexhaustible hordes have followed their\r\nlong pathways of the sea, swimming by some strange instinct always\r\nmore or less over the same courses--ever with their tireless enemies,\r\nboth in and out of the water, hot foot on their tracks. Sharks,\r\ndog-fish, wolf-fish, cod, and every fish large enough to swallow them,\r\ngulls, divers, auks, and almost every bird of the air, to say nothing\r\nof the nets set now from steam-propelled ships, might well threaten\r\ntheir speedy extermination. This is especially true when we remember\r\nthat even their eggs are preyed upon in almost incalculable bulk as\r\nsoon as they are deposited. But phoenix-like they continue to reappear\r\nin such vast quantities that they are still the cheapest food on the\r\nmarket. Such huge numbers are caught at one time that they have now\r\nand again to be used for fertilizer, or dumped overboard into the sea.\r\nThe great bay of Stornaway Harbour was so deeply covered in oil from\r\nthe fish while we lay there, that the sailing boats raced to and fro\r\nbefore fine breezes and yet the wind could not even ripple the\r\nsurface of the sea, as if at last millennial conditions had\r\nmaterialized. Many times we saw nets which had caught such quantities\r\nof fish at once that they had sunk to the bottom. They were only\r\nrescued with great difficulty, and then the fish were so swollen by\r\nbeing drowned in the net that it took hours of hard work and delay to\r\nshake their now distended bodies out again.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for both holding simple religious services and\r\nrendering medical help from our dispensary were numerous, and we\r\nthought sufficiently needed to call for some sort of permanent effort;\r\nso later the Society established a small mission room in the harbour.\r\n\r\nAlcohol has always been a menace to Scotch life, though their\r\nfishermen were singularly free from rioting and drunkenness. Indeed,\r\ntheir home-born piety was continually a protest to the indulgence of\r\nthe mixed crowd which at that time followed King Henry. Scores of\r\ntimes have I seen a humble crew of poor fishermen, who themselves\r\nowned their small craft, observing the Sunday as if they were in their\r\nhomes, while the skippers of large vessels belonging to others fished\r\nall the week round at the beck of their absent owners, thinking they\r\nmade more money in that way.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the present Lord Southborough, then Mr. Francis Hopwood, and a\r\nmember of the Mission Board, returned from a visit to Canada and\r\nNewfoundland. He brought before the Council the opportunities for\r\nservice among the fishermen of the northwest Atlantic, and the\r\nsuggestion was handed on to me in the form of a query. Would I\r\nconsider crossing the Atlantic in one of our small sailing vessels,\r\nand make an inquiry into the problem?\r\n\r\nSome of my older friends have thought that my decision to go was made\r\nunder strong religious excitement, and in response to some deep-seated\r\nconviction that material sacrifices or physical discomforts commended\r\none to God. I must, however, disclaim all such lofty motives. I have\r\nalways believed that the Good Samaritan went across the road to the\r\nwounded man just because he wanted to. I do not believe that he felt\r\nany sacrifice or fear in the matter. If he did, I know very well that\r\nI did not. On the contrary, there is everything about such a venture\r\nto attract my type of mind, and making preparations for the long\r\nvoyage was an unmitigated delight.\r\n\r\nThe boat which I selected was ketch-rigged--much like a yawl, but more\r\ncomfortable for lying-to in heavy weather, the sail area being more\r\nevenly distributed. Her freeboard being only three feet, we replaced\r\nher wooden hatches, which were too large for handling patients, by\r\niron ones; and also sheathed her forward along the water-line with\r\ngreenheart to protect her planking in ice. For running in high seas we\r\nput a large square sail forward, tripping the yard along the foremast,\r\nmuch like a spinnaker boom. Having a screw steering gear which took\r\ntwo men to handle quickly enough when she yawed and threatened to jibe\r\nin a big swell, it proved very useful.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the spring of 1892 that we were ready to start. We\r\nhad secured a master with a certificate, for though I was myself a\r\nmaster mariner, and my mate had been in charge of our vessel in the\r\nNorth Sea for many years, we had neither of us been across the\r\nAtlantic before. The skipper was a Cornishman, Trevize by name, and a\r\nmartinet on discipline--an entirely new experience to a crew of North\r\nSea fishermen. He was so particular about everything being just so\r\nthat quite a few days were lost in starting, though well spent as far\r\nas preparedness went. Nothing was wanting when at last, in the second\r\nweek of June, the tugboat let us go, and crowds of friends waved us\r\ngood-bye from the pier-head as we passed out with our bunting\r\nstanding. We had not intended to touch land again until it should rise\r\nout of the western horizon, but off the south coast of Ireland we met\r\nwith heavy seas and head winds, so we ran into Crookhaven to visit our\r\ncolleagues who worked at that station. Our old patients in that lonely\r\ncorner were almost as interested as ourselves in the new venture, and\r\nmany were the good eggs and \"meals of greens\" which they brought down\r\nto the ship as parting tokens. Indeed, we shrewdly guessed that our\r\n\"dry\" principles alone robbed us of more than \"one drop o' potheen\"\r\nwhose birth the light of the moon had witnessed.\r\n\r\nAs we were not fortunate in encountering fair winds, it was not until\r\nthe twelfth day that we saw our first iceberg, almost running into it\r\nin a heavy fog. The fall in the temperature of the sea surface had\r\nwarned us that we were in the cold current, and three or four days of\r\ndense fog emphasized the fact. As it was midsummer, we felt the change\r\nkeenly, when suddenly on the seventeenth day the fog lifted, and a\r\nhigh evergreen-crowned coast-line greeted our delighted eyes. A lofty\r\nlighthouse on a rocky headland enabled us almost immediately to\r\ndiscover our exact position. We were just a little north of St. John's\r\nHarbour, which, being my first landfall across the Atlantic, impressed\r\nme as a really marvellous feat; but what was our surprise as we\r\napproached the high cliffs which guard the entrance to see dense\r\ncolumns of smoke arising, and to feel the offshore wind grow hotter\r\nand hotter as the pilot tug towed us between the headlands. For the\r\nthird time in its history the city of St. John's was in flames.\r\n\r\nThe heat was fierce when we at last anchored, and had the height of\r\nthe blaze not passed, we should certainly have been glad to seek again\r\nthe cool of our icy friends outside. Some ships had even been burned\r\nat their anchors. We could count thirteen fiercely raging fires in\r\nvarious parts of the city, which looked like one vast funeral pyre.\r\nOnly the brick chimneys of the houses remained standing blackened and\r\ncharred. Smoke and occasional flame would burst out here and there as\r\nthe fickle eddies of wind, influenced, no doubt, by the heat, whirled\r\naround as if in sport over the scene of man's discomfitures. On the\r\nhillside stood a solitary house almost untouched, which, had there\r\nbeen any reason for its being held sacred, might well have served as a\r\ndemonstration of Heaven's special intervention in its behalf. As it\r\nwas, it seemed to mock the still smouldering wreck of the beautiful\r\nstone cathedral just beside it. Among the ruins in this valley of\r\ndesolation little groups of men darted hither and thither, resembling\r\nfrom the harbour nothing so much as tiny black imps gloating over a\r\ncongenial environment. I hope never again to see the sight that might\r\nwell have suggested Gehenna to a less active imagination than Dante's.\r\n\r\nHuts had been erected in open places to shelter the homeless; long\r\nqueues of hungry human beings defiled before temporary booths which\r\nserved out soup and other rations. Every nook and corner of house-room\r\nleft was crowded to overflowing with derelict persons and their\r\nbelongings. The roads to the country, like those now in the environs\r\nof the towns in northern France, were dotted with exiles and belated\r\nvehicles, hauling in every direction the remnants of household goods.\r\nThe feeling as of a rudely disturbed antheap dominated one's mind, and\r\nyet, in spite of it all, the hospitality and welcome which we as\r\nstrangers received was as wonderful as if we had been a relief ship\r\nladen with supplies to replace the immense amount destroyed in the\r\nships and stores of the city. Moreover, the cheerfulness of the town\r\nwas amazing. Scarcely a \"peep\" or \"squeal\" did we hear, and not a\r\nsingle diatribe against the authorities. Every one had suffered\r\ntogether. Nor was it due to any one's fault. True, the town\r\nwater-supply had been temporarily out of commission, some stranger was\r\nsaid to have been smoking in the hay loft, Providence had not\r\nspecially intervened to save property, and hence this result. Thus to\r\nour relief it was a city of hope, not of despair, and to our amazement\r\nthey were able to show most kindly interest in problems such as ours\r\nwhich seemed so remote at the moment. None of us will ever forget\r\ntheir kindness, from the Governor Sir Terence O'Brien, and the Prime\r\nMinister, Sir William Whiteway, to the humblest stevedore on the\r\nwharves.\r\n\r\nI had expected to spend the greater part of our time cruising among\r\nthe fishing schooners out of sight of land on the big Banks as we did\r\nin the North Sea; but I was advised that owing to fog and isolation,\r\neach vessel working separately and bringing its own catch to market,\r\nit would be a much more profitable outlay of time, if we were to\r\nfollow the large fleet of over one hundred schooners, with some thirty\r\nthousand fishermen, women, and children which had just sailed North\r\nfor summer work along the coast of Labrador. To better aid us the\r\nGovernment provided a pilot free of expense, and their splendid\r\nSuperintendent of Fisheries, Mr. Adolph Nielsen, also accepted the\r\ninvitation to accompany us, to make our experiment more exhaustive and\r\nvaluable by a special scientific inquiry into the habits and manner of\r\nthe fish as well as of the fishermen. Naturally a good deal of delay\r\nhad occurred owing to the unusual congestion of business which needed\r\nimmediate attention and the unfortunate temporary lack of facilities;\r\nbut we got under way at last, and sailing \"down North\" some four\r\nhundred miles and well outside the land, eventually ran in on a\r\nparallel and made the Labrador coast on the 4th of August.\r\n\r\nThe exhilarating memory of that day is one which will die only when we\r\ndo. A glorious sun shone over an oily ocean of cerulean blue, over a\r\nhundred towering icebergs of every fantastic shape, and flashing all\r\nof the colours of the rainbow from their gleaming pinnacles as they\r\nrolled on the long and lazy swell. Birds familiar and strange left the\r\ndense shoals of rippling fish, over which great flocks were hovering\r\nand quarrelling in noisy enjoyment, to wave us welcome as they swept\r\nin joyous circles overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LURE OF THE LABRADOR\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years have passed away since that day, and a thousand more\r\nimportant affairs which have occurred in the meantime have faded from\r\nmy memory; but still its events stand out clear and sharp. The large\r\nand lofty island, its top covered with green verdure, so wonderful a\r\nlandmark from the sea, its peaks capped with the fleecy mist of early\r\nmorning, rose in a setting of the purest azure blue. For the first\r\ntime I saw the faces of its ruddy cliffs, their ledges picked out with\r\nthe homes of myriad birds. Its feet were bathed in the dark, rich\r\ngreen of the Atlantic water, edged by the line of pure white breakers,\r\nwhere the gigantic swell lazily hurled immeasurable mountains of water\r\nagainst its titanic bastions, evoking peals of sound like thunder from\r\nits cavernous recesses--a very riot of magnificence. The great schools\r\nof whales, noisily slapping the calm surface of the sea with their\r\nhuge tails as in an _abandon_ of joy, dived and rose, and at times\r\nthrew the whole of their mighty carcasses right out of water for a\r\nbath in the glorious morning sunshine. The shoals of fish everywhere\r\nbreaching the water, and the silver streaks which flashed beneath our\r\nbows as we lazed along, suggested that the whole vast ocean was too\r\nsmall to hold its riches.\r\n\r\nWhen we realized that practically no man had ever lived there, and few\r\nhad even seen it, it seemed to overwhelm us, coming as we did from the\r\ncrowded Island of our birth, where notices not to trespass haunted\r\neven the dreams of the average man.\r\n\r\nA serried rank of range upon range of hills, reaching north and south\r\nas far as the eye could see from the masthead, was rising above our\r\nhorizon behind a very surfeit of islands, bewildering the minds of men\r\naccustomed to our English and North Sea coast-lines.\r\n\r\nIn a ship just the size of the famous Matthew, we had gone west,\r\nfollowing almost the exact footsteps of the great John Cabot when just\r\nfour hundred years before he had fared forth on his famous venture of\r\ndiscovery. We seemed now almost able to share the exhilaration which\r\nonly such experiences can afford the human soul, and the vast\r\npotential resources for the blessing of humanity of this great land\r\nstill practically untouched.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to anchor among many schooners in a wonderful natural\r\nharbour called Domino Run, so named because the Northern fleets all\r\npass through it on their way North and South. Had we been painted\r\nscarlet, and flown the Black Jack instead of the Red Ensign, we could\r\nnot have attracted more attention. Flags of greeting were run up to\r\nall mastheads, and boats from all sides were soon aboard inquiring\r\ninto the strange phenomenon. Our object explained, we soon had calls\r\nfor a doctor, and it has been the experience of almost every visitor\r\nto the coast from that day to this that he is expected to have a\r\nknowledge of medicine.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Cape Uivuk\r\n   THE LABRADOR COAST]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: The Tickle Anchorage\r\n   THE LABRADOR COAST]\r\n\r\nOne impression made on my mind that day undoubtedly influenced all my\r\nsubsequent actions. Late in the evening, when the rush of visitors was\r\nlargely over, I noticed a miserable bunch of boards, serving as a\r\nboat, with only a dab of tar along its seams, lying motionless a\r\nlittle way from us. In it, sitting silent, was a half-clad,\r\nbrown-haired, brown-faced figure. After long hesitation, during which\r\ntime I had been watching him from the rail, he suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n\"Be you a real doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I call myself,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Us hasn't got no money,\" he fenced, \"but there's a very sick man\r\nashore, if so be you'd come and see him.\"\r\n\r\nA little later he led me to a tiny sod-covered hovel, compared with\r\nwhich the Irish cabins were palaces. It had one window of odd\r\nfragments of glass. The floor was of pebbles from the beach; the earth\r\nwalls were damp and chilly. There were half a dozen rude wooden bunks\r\nbuilt in tiers around the single room, and a group of some six\r\nneglected children, frightened by our arrival, were huddled together\r\nin one corner. A very sick man was coughing his soul out in the\r\ndarkness of a lower bunk, while a pitiably covered woman gave him cold\r\nwater to sip out of a spoon. There was no furniture except a small\r\nstove with an iron pipe leading through a hole in the roof.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank as I thought of the little I could do for the sufferer\r\nin such surroundings. He had pneumonia, a high fever, and was probably\r\ntubercular. The thought of our attractive little hospital on board at\r\nonce rose to my mind; but how could one sail away with this husband\r\nand father, probably never to bring him back. Advice, medicine, a few\r\npackages of food were only temporizing. The poor mother could never\r\nnurse him and tend the family. Furthermore, their earning season,\r\n\"while the fish were in,\" was slipping away. To pray for the man, and\r\nwith the family, was easy, but scarcely satisfying. A hospital and a\r\ntrained nurse was the only chance for this bread-winner--and neither\r\nwas available.\r\n\r\nI called in a couple of months later as we came South before the\r\napproach of winter. Snow was already on the ground. The man was dead\r\nand buried; there was no provision whatever for the family, who were\r\ndestitute, except for the hollow mockery of a widow's grant of twenty\r\ndollars a year. This, moreover, had to be taken up in goods at a truck\r\nstore, less debts _if_ she owed any.\r\n\r\nAmong the nine hundred patients that still show on the records of that\r\nlong-ago voyage, some stand out more than others for their peculiar\r\npathos and their utter helplessness. I shall never forget one poor\r\nEskimo. In firing a cannon to salute the arrival of the Moravian\r\nMission ship, the gun exploded prematurely, blowing off both the man's\r\narms below the elbows. He had been lying on his back for a fortnight,\r\nthe pathetic stumps covered only with far from sterile rags dipped in\r\ncold water. We remained some days, and did all we could for his\r\nbenefit; but he too joined the great host that is forever \"going\r\nwest,\" for want of what the world fails to give them.\r\n\r\nIt is not given to every member of our profession to enjoy the\r\nknowledge that he alone stands between the helpless and suffering or\r\ndeath, for in civilization modern amenities have almost annihilated\r\nspace and time, and the sensations of the Yankee at the Court of King\r\nArthur are destroyed by the realization of competitors, \"just as\r\ngood,\" even if it often does leave one conscious of limitations. The\r\nsuccessful removal of a molar which has given torture for weeks in a\r\ndentistless country, gains one as much gratitude as the amputation of\r\na limb. One mere boy came to me with necrosis of one side of his lower\r\njaw due to nothing but neglected toothache. It had to be dug out from\r\nthe new covering of bone which had grown up all around it. The\r\nwhimsical expression of his lop-sided face still haunts me.\r\n\r\nDeformities went untreated. The crippled and blind halted through\r\nlife, victims of what \"the blessed Lord saw best for them.\" The\r\ntorture of an ingrowing toe-nail, which could be relieved in a few\r\nminutes, had incapacitated one poor father for years. Tuberculosis and\r\nrickets carried on their evil work unchecked. Preventable poverty was\r\nthe efficient handmaid of these two latter diseases.\r\n\r\nThere was also much social work to be done in connection with the\r\nmedical. Education in every one of its branches--especially public\r\nhealth--was almost nonexistent--as were many simple social amenities\r\nwhich might have been so easily induced.\r\n\r\nAt one village a woman with five children asked us if we could marry\r\nher to her husband. They had never been together when a parson\r\nhappened along, and they now lived in a lonely cove three miles away.\r\nThis seemed a genuine case of distress; and as it happened a parson\r\nwas taking a passage with us, we sent two of our crew over in a boat\r\nto round up the groom. Apparently he was not at all anxious, but being\r\na very small man and she a large woman, he discreetly acquiesced. The\r\nwedding was held on board our ship, every one entering into the spirit\r\nof the unusual occasion. The main hold was crammed with guests, bells\r\nwere rung and flags flown, guns fired, and at night distress rockets\r\nwere sent up. We kept in touch with the happy couple for years, till\r\nonce more they moved away to try their luck elsewhere.\r\n\r\nObviously the coast offered us work that would not be done unless we\r\ndid it. Here was real need along any line on which one could labour,\r\nin a section of our own Empire, where the people embodied all our best\r\nsea traditions. They exhibited many of the attractive characteristics\r\nwhich, even when buried beneath habits and customs the outcome of\r\ntheir environment, always endear men of the sea to the genuine\r\nAnglo-Saxon. They were uncomplaining, optimistic, splendidly\r\nresourceful, cheerful and generous--and after all in one sense soap\r\nand water only makes the outside of the platter clean.\r\n\r\nI confess that we had greatly enjoyed the adventure _qua_ adventure.\r\nMysterious fjords which wound out of sight into the fastnesses of\r\nunknown mountains, and which were entirely uncharted, fairly shouted\r\nan invitation to enter and discover what was round the next corner.\r\nIslands by the hundred, hitherto never placed on any map, challenged\r\none's hydrographic skill. Families of strange birds, which came\r\nswinging seaward as the season advanced, suggested a virgin field for\r\nhunting. Berries and flowering plants, as excellent as they were\r\nunfamiliar, appealed for exploration. Great boulders perched on\r\nperilous peaks, torn and twisted strata, with here and there raised\r\nbeaches, and great outcrops of black trap-rock piercing through red\r\ngranite cliffs in giant vertical seams--all piqued one's curiosity to\r\nknow the geology of this unknown land. Some stone arrow-heads and\r\nknives, brought to me by a fisherman, together with the memories that\r\nthe Norse Vikings and their competitors on the scroll of discovery\r\nmade their first landfall on this the nearest section of the American\r\ncoast to Europe, excited one's curiosity to know more of these shores.\r\nThe dense growth of evergreen trees abounding in every river valley,\r\nand the exquisite streams with trout and salmon and seals attracted\r\none whose familiarity with sport and forests was inseparably connected\r\nwith notices to trespassers.\r\n\r\nIt only wanted an adventure such as we had one day while sailing up a\r\nfjord on a prosaic professional call, when we upset our cutter and had\r\nto camp for the night, to give spice to our other experiences, and\r\nmade us wish to return another year, better equipped, and with a more\r\ncompetent staff.\r\n\r\nI am far from being the only person from the outside world who has\r\nexperienced what Wallace describes as \"the Lure of the Labrador.\" It\r\nwas a genuine surprise to me one morning to find ice on deck--a scale\r\nof sparkling crystals most beautifully picking out the water-line of\r\nour little craft. It was only then that I realized that October had\r\ncome. The days, so full of incident, had passed away like ships in the\r\nnight. Whither away was the question? We could not stay even though we\r\nfelt the urgent call to remain. So \"Heigho for the southward bar\" and\r\na visit to St. John's to try and arouse interest in the new-discovered\r\nproblems, before we should once more let go our stern lines and be\r\nbowling homeward before the fall nor'westers to dear old England.\r\n\r\nHome-going craft had generously carried our story before us to the\r\ncity of St. John's. The Board of Trade commended our effort. The\r\npapers had written of the new phenomenon; the politicians had not\r\nrefrained from commendation. His Excellency the Governor made our path\r\nplain by calling a meeting in Government House, where the following\r\nresolution was passed:\r\n\r\n\"That this meeting, representing the principal merchants and traders\r\ncarrying on the fisheries, especially on the Labrador coast, and\r\nothers interested in the welfare of this colony, desires to tender its\r\nwarmest thanks to the directors of the Deep-Sea Mission for sending\r\ntheir hospital ship Albert to visit the settlement on the Labrador\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n\"Much of our fishing industry is carried on in regions beyond the\r\nordinary reach of medical aid, or of charity, and it is with the\r\ndeepest sense of gratitude that this meeting learns of the amount of\r\nmedical and surgical work done....\r\n\r\n\"This meeting also desires to express the hope that the directors may\r\nsee their way to continue the work thus begun, and should they do so,\r\nthey may be assured of the earnest coöperation of all classes of this\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen at last we said good-bye on our homeward voyage, our cabins were\r\nloaded with generous souvenirs for the journey, and no king on his\r\nthrone was happier than every man of the crew of the good ship Albert.\r\n\r\nOur report to the Council in London, followed by the resolution sent\r\nby the Newfoundland Committee, induced the Society to repeat the\r\nexperiment on a larger scale the following spring. Thus, with two\r\nyoung doctors, Elliott Curwen of Cambridge and Arthur Bobardt from\r\nAustralia, and two nurses, Miss Cawardine and Miss Williams, we again\r\nset out the following June.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was uneventful except that I was nearly left behind in\r\nmid-Atlantic. While playing cricket on deck our last ball went over\r\nthe side, and I after it, shouting to the helmsman to tack back. This\r\nhe did, but I failed to cut him off the first time, as he got a bit\r\nrattled. However, we rescued the ball.\r\n\r\nWe had chosen two islands two hundred miles apart for cottage\r\nhospitals, one at Battle Harbour, on the north side of the entrance of\r\nthe St. Lawrence (Straits of Belle Isle), and the other at Indian\r\nHarbour, out in the Atlantic at the mouth of the great Hamilton Inlet.\r\nBoth places were the centres of large fisheries, and were the\r\n\"bring-ups\" for numberless schooners of the Labrador fleet on their\r\nway North and South. The first, a building already half finished, was\r\ndonated by a local fishery firm by the name of Baine, Johnston and\r\nCompany. This was quickly made habitable, and patients were admitted\r\nunder Dr. Bobardt's care. The second building, assembled at St.\r\nJohn's, was shipped by the donors, who were the owners of the Indian\r\nHarbour fishery, Job Brothers and Company. Owing to difficulties in\r\nlanding, this building was not completed and ready for use until the\r\nfollowing year, so Dr. Curwen took charge of the hospital ship Albert,\r\nand I cruised as far north as Okkak (lat. 57°) in the Princess May, a\r\nmidget steam launch, eight feet wide, with a cook and an engineer. As\r\nthere was no coal obtainable in the North, we used wood, and her\r\nfire-box being small the amount of cutting entailed left a permanent\r\nimpression on our biceps.\r\n\r\nA friend from Ireland had presented this little boat, which I found\r\nlying up on the Chester Race-Course, near our home on the Sands of\r\nDee. We had repaired her and steamed her through the canal into the\r\nMersey, where, somewhat to our humiliation, she had been slung up onto\r\nthe deck of an Allan liner for her trans-Atlantic passage, as if she\r\nwere nothing but an extra hand satchel. Nor was our pride restored\r\nwhen on her arrival it was found that her funnel was missing among the\r\ngeneral baggage in the hold. We had to wait in St. John's for a new\r\none before starting on our trip North. The close of the voyage proved\r\na fitting corollary. In crossing the Straits of Belle Isle, the last\r\nboat to leave the Labrador, we ran short of fuel, and had to burn our\r\ncabin-top to make the French shore, having also lost our compass\r\noverboard. Here we delayed repairing and refitting so long that the\r\nauthorities in St. John's became alarmed and despatched their mail\r\nsteamer in search of us. I still remember my astonishment, when, on\r\nboarding the steamer, the lively skipper, a very tender-hearted father\r\nof a family, threw both arms around me with a mighty hug and\r\nexclaimed, \"Thank God, we all thought you were gone. A schooner picked\r\nup your flagpole at sea.\" Poor fellow, he was a fine Christian seaman,\r\nbut only a year or two later he perished with his large steamer while\r\nI still rove this rugged coast.\r\n\r\nThat summer we visited the stations of the Moravian Brethren, who were\r\nkindness personified to us. Their stations, five in number, dated back\r\nover a hundred and thirty years, yet they had never had a doctor among\r\nthem. It would scarcely be modest for me to protest that they were the\r\nworse off for that circumstance. Each station was well armed with\r\nhomoeopathic pills, and at least those do no harm; while one old\r\nGerman house-father had really performed with complete success\r\ncraniotomy and delivery of a child _en morcellement_, in the case of a\r\ncolleague's wife. During our stay they gave us plenty of work among\r\ntheir Eskimos, and were good enough to report most favourably of our\r\nwork to their home Committee.\r\n\r\nAs there was no chart of any use for the coast north of Hopedale, few\r\nif any corrections having been made in the topographic efforts of the\r\nlong late Captain Cook, of around-the-world reputation, one of the\r\nBrethren, Mr. Christopher Schmidt, joined the Princess May to help me\r\nfind their northern stations among the plethora of islands which\r\nfringe the coast in that vicinity. Never in my life had I expected any\r\njourney half so wonderful. We travelled through endless calm fjords,\r\nruns, tickles, bays, and straits without ever seeing the open sea, and\r\nwith hardly a ripple on the surface. We passed high mountains and\r\nlofty cliffs, crossed the mouths of large rivers, left groves of\r\nspruce and fir and larches on both sides of us, and saw endless birds,\r\namong them the Canada goose, eider duck, surf scoters, and many\r\ncommoner sea-fowl. As it was both impossible and dangerous to proceed\r\nafter dark, when no longer able to run we would go ashore and gather\r\nspecimens of the abundant and beautiful sub-arctic flora, and\r\noccasionally capture a bird or a dish of trout to help out our\r\ndiminutive larder.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ESKIMO WOMAN AND BABY]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ESKIMO MAN]\r\n\r\nAmong the Eskimos I found a great deal of tuberculosis and much eye\r\ntrouble. Around the Moravian Mission stations wooden houses had\r\nlargely replaced the former \"tubiks,\" or skin tents, which were moved\r\nas occasion required and so provided for sanitation. These wooden huts\r\nwere undrained, dark and dirty to a remarkable degree. No water supply\r\nwas provided, and the spaces between the houses were simply\r\nindescribable garbage heaps, presided over by innumerable dogs. The\r\naverage life was very short and infant mortality high. The best for\r\nwhich we could hope in the way of morals among these people was that a\r\nnatural unmorality was some offset to the existing conditions. The\r\nfeatures of the native life which appealed most to us were the\r\nuniversal optimism, the laughing good-nature and contentment, and the\r\nSunday cleanliness of the entire congregation which swarmed into the\r\nchapel service, a welcome respite from the perennial dirt of the week\r\ndays. Moreover, nearly all had been taught to read and write in\r\nEskimo, though there is no literature in that language to read, except\r\nsuch books as have been translated by the Moravian Brethren. At that\r\ntime a strict policy of teaching no English had been adopted. Words\r\nlacking in the language, like \"God,\" \"love,\" etc., were substituted by\r\nGerman words. Nearly every Eskimo counted \"ein, zwei, drei.\" In one of\r\nmy lectures, on returning to England, I mentioned that as the Eskimos\r\nhad never seen a lamb or a sheep either alive or in a picture, the\r\nMoravians, in order to offer them an intelligible and appealing\r\nsimile, had most wisely substituted the kotik, or white seal, for the\r\nphrase \"the Lamb of God.\" One old lady in my audience must have felt\r\nthat the good Brethren were tampering unjustifiably with Holy Writ,\r\nfor the following summer, from the barrels of clothing sent out to\r\nthe Labrador, was extracted a dirty, distorted, and much-mangled and\r\nwholly sorry-looking woolly toy lamb. Its _raison d'être_ was a\r\nmystery until we read the legend carefully pinned to one dislocated\r\nleg, \"Sent in order that the heathen may know better.\"\r\n\r\nTheir love for music and ability to do part-playing and singing also\r\ngreatly impressed us, and we spent many evenings enjoying their brass\r\nbands and their Easter and Christmas carols. We made some records of\r\nthese on our Edison phonograph, and they were overpowered with joy\r\nwhen they heard their own voices coming back to them from the machine.\r\nThe magic lantern also proved exceedingly popular, and several tried\r\nto touch the pictures and see if they could not hold them. We were\r\nalso able to show some hastily made lantern slides of themselves, and\r\nI shall never forget their joyful excitement. The following season, in\r\ngiving them some lantern views, we chanced to show a slide of an old\r\nEskimo woman who had died during the winter. The subsequent commotion\r\ncaused among the \"little people\" was unintelligible to us until one of\r\nthe Moravian Brethren explained that they thought her spirit had taken\r\nvisible form and returned to her own haunts.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in the gardens at Nain when a northerly air made it\r\nfeel chilly and the thermometer stood only a little above freezing. A\r\ntroop of Eskimo women came out to cover up the potatoes. Every row of\r\npotatoes is covered with arched sticks and long strips of canvas along\r\nthem. A huge roll of sacking is kept near each row and the whole is\r\ndrawn over and the potatoes are tucked in bed for the night. I could\r\nnot resist the temptation to lift the bedclothes and shake hands and\r\nsay good-night to one of the nearest plants, whereat the merry little\r\npeople went off into convulsions of laughter.\r\n\r\nAt Hopedale there was a large Danish ship with over six hundred tons\r\nof cargo for the new Moravian buildings. The Brethren do not build as\r\nwe are doing from coast material. In order to save time and also to\r\nhave more substantial buildings, they are cut out and built in\r\nGermany, photographed, and each piece marked. Then they are taken to\r\npieces, shipped, and sent out here for erection.\r\n\r\nSome years ago in Germany, when the Socialists were wearing beards and\r\nmustaches, all respectable people used to shave. Therefore the\r\nmissionaries being Germans insisted on the Eskimos shaving as they\r\ndid. The result is that at one store at least a stock of ancient\r\nrazors are left on hand, for now neither missionary nor Eskimo shaves\r\nin the inhospitable climate of this country. A small stock of these\r\nrazors was, therefore, left on my account in some graves from which\r\none or two Eskimos were good enough to go and get us a few ancient\r\nstone implements. It is a marvellous thing how superstition still\r\nclings around the very best of native Christian communities.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Mission is a trading mission. This trading policy in some\r\naspects is in its favour. It is unquestionably part of a message of\r\nreal love to a brother to put within his reach at reasonable rates\r\nthose adjuncts of civilized life that help to make less onerous his\r\nhard lot. Trade, however, is always a difficult form of charity, and\r\nthe barter system, common to this coast, being in vogue at the\r\nMoravian Mission stations also, practically every Eskimo was in debt\r\nto them. In reality this caused a vicious circle, for it encouraged\r\ndirectly the outstanding fault of the Eskimo, his readiness to leave\r\nthe morrow to care for itself so long as he does not starve to-day.\r\nLike a race of children, they need the stimulus of necessity to make\r\nthem get out and do their best while the opportunity exists. In the\r\npast twenty-six years I have made many voyages to one and another of\r\nthe stations of the Brethren, and have learned to love them all very\r\nsincerely as individuals, though their mission policies are their own\r\nand not mine.\r\n\r\nI remember once in Nain the slob ice had already made ballicaters and\r\nthe biting cold of winter so far north had set in with all its vigour.\r\nThere was a heavy sea and a gale of wind. One of two boats which had\r\nbeen out all day had not come in. The sea was so rough and the wind so\r\nstrong that the occupants of the first boat could not face it, and so\r\nhad run in under the land and walked all the way round, towing their\r\nboat by a long line from the shore. Night came on and the second boat\r\nhad not appeared. Next morning the Nain folk knew that some accident\r\nmust have happened. Some men reported that the evening before they had\r\nseen through a glass the boat trying to beat against the storm, and\r\nthen disappear. The Eskimos gathered together to see what could be\r\ndone and then decided that it was kismet--and went their way. The\r\nfollowing evening a tiny light was seen on the far shore of the\r\nbay--some one must be alive there. There was no food or shelter there,\r\nand it was obvious that help was needed. The gale was still blowing in\r\nfury and the sea was as rough as ever, and Eskimos and missionaries\r\ndecided that in their unseaworthy boats they could do nothing. There\r\nwas one dissentient voice--Brother Schmidt; and he went and rescued\r\nthem. One was nearly spent. When their boat had capsized, one man, a\r\nwoman, and a lad had been drowned, but two men had succeeded in\r\ngetting into their kajaks and floated off when the disaster happened.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ESKIMO GIRLS]\r\n\r\nWith October came the necessity for returning South, and the long\r\ndark nights spent at the little fishing stations as we journeyed from\r\nplace to place proved all too short. The gatherings for lantern\r\nmeetings, for simple services, for spinning yarns, together with\r\nmedicine and such surgery as we could accomplish under the\r\ncircumstances, made every moment busy and enjoyable. One outstanding\r\nfeature, however, everywhere impressed an Englishman--the absolute\r\nnecessity for some standard medium of exchange. Till one has seen the\r\ntruck system at work, its evil effects in enslaving and demoralizing\r\nthe poor are impossible to realize.\r\n\r\nAll the length and breadth of the coast, the poorer people would show\r\nme their \"settling up\" as they called their account, though many never\r\ngot as far as having any \"settling up\" given them--so they lived and\r\ndied in debt to their merchant. They never knew the independence of a\r\ndollar in their pockets and the consequent incentive and value of\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible to me that even large concerns like the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany would not pay in cash for valuable furs, and that so many\r\ndealers in the necessities of life should be still able to hold free\r\nmen in economic bondage. It seemed a veritable chapter from \"Through\r\nthe Looking Glass,\" to hear the \"grocer\" and \"haberdasher\" talking of\r\n\"my people,\" meaning their patrons, and holding over them the whip of\r\nrefusal to sell them necessities in their hour of need if at any time\r\nthey dealt with outsiders, however much to their advantage such a\r\ncourse might be.\r\n\r\nThis fact was first impressed upon me in an odd way. Early in the\r\nsummer an Eskimo had come aboard the hospital ship with a bear skin\r\nand a few other furs to sell. We had not only been delighted with the\r\nchance to buy them, but had spread them all around the cabin and\r\ntaken a picture of him in the middle. Later in the season, while\r\nshowing my photograph album to a trader, he had suddenly remarked,\r\n\"Why, what's ---- doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Selling me some beautiful furs,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! was he?\" said the man. \"I'll make him sing for selling the furs\r\nfor which I supplied him.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no salve to his fretfulness when I assured him that I had paid\r\nin good English gold, and that his \"dealer\" would be as honest with\r\nthe money as the system had made him. But the trader knew that the\r\ntruck system creates slippery, tricky men; and the fisherman openly\r\ndeclares war on the merchant, making the most of his few opportunities\r\nto outwit his opponent.\r\n\r\nA few years later a man brought a silver fox skin aboard my ship, just\r\nsuch a one as I had been requested by an English lady to secure for\r\nher. As fulfilling such a request would involve me in hostilities\r\n(which, however, I do not think were useless), I asked the man, who\r\nwas wretchedly poor, if he owed the skin to the trader.\r\n\r\n\"I am in debt,\" he replied, \"but they will only allow me eight dollars\r\noff my account for this skin, and I want to buy some food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I answered. \"If you will promise to go at once and pay\r\neight dollars off your debt, I will give you eight gold sovereigns for\r\nthis skin.\"\r\n\r\nTo this he agreed, and faithfully carried out the agreement--while the\r\nEnglish lady scored a bargain, and I a very black mark in the books of\r\nmy friend the trader.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion my little steamer had temporarily broken down, and\r\nto save time I had journeyed on in the jolly-boat, leaving the cook to\r\nsteer the vessel after me. I wanted to visit a very poor family, one\r\nof whose eight children I had taken to hospital for bone tuberculosis\r\nthe previous year, and to whom the Mission had made a liberal grant\r\nof warm clothing. As the steamer had not come along by night, I had to\r\nsleep in the tiny one-roomed shack which served as a home. True, since\r\nit stood on the edge of the forest, there was little excuse that it\r\nwas no larger; but the father, a most excellent, honest, and faithful\r\nworker, was obviously discouraged. He had not nearly enough proper\r\nfood for his family; clothing was even more at a discount; tools with\r\nwhich to work were almost as lacking as in a cave man's dwelling; the\r\nwhole family was going to pieces from sheer discouragement. The\r\nprevious winter on the opposite bank of the same river, called Big\r\nRiver, a neighbour had in desperation sent his wife and eldest boy out\r\nof the house, killed his young family, and then shot himself.\r\n\r\nWhen night came five of the children huddled together for warmth in\r\none bed, and the parents and balance of the family in the other. I\r\nslept on the floor near the door in my sleeping-bag, with my nose\r\nglued to the crack to get a breath of God's cold air, in spite of the\r\nneed for warmth--for not a blanket did the house possess. When I\r\nasked, a little hurt, where were the blankets which we had sent last\r\nyear, the mother somewhat indignantly pointed to various trousers and\r\ncoats which betrayed their final resting-place, and remarked, \"If\r\nyou'se had five lads all trying to get under one covering to onct,\r\nDoctor, you'd soon know what would happen to that blanket.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I made a boiling of cocoa, and took the two elder\r\nboys out for a seal hunt while waiting for my steamer. I was just in\r\ntime to see one boy carefully upset his mug of cocoa, when he thought\r\nI was not looking, and replace it with cold spring water. \"I 'lows\r\nI'se not accustomed to no sweetness\" was his simple explanation. It\r\nwas raw and damp as we rowed into the estuary at sunrise in search of\r\nthe seals. I was chilly even in a well-lined leather coat. But the\r\ntwo shock-headed boys, clad in ancient cotton shirts, and with what\r\nhad once been only cotton overall jackets, were as jolly as crickets,\r\nand apparently almost unduly warm. The Labrador has taught me one\r\ntruth, which as a physician I never forget, that is, coddling is the\r\nterrible menace of civilization, and \"to endure hardness\" is the best\r\npreparation for a \"good soldier.\" On leaving, I promised to send to\r\nthose boys, whose contentment and cheerfulness greatly endeared them\r\nto me, a dozen good fox traps in order to give them a chance for the\r\ncoming winter. Such a gift as those old iron rat traps seemed in their\r\neyes! When at last they arrived, and were really their own\r\npossessions, no prince could have been prouder than they. The next\r\nsummer as I steamed North, we called in at D---- B----'s house. The\r\nsame famine in the land seemed to prevail; the same lack of apparently\r\neverything which I should have wanted. But the old infective smile was\r\nstill presented with an almost religious ceremonial, and my friend\r\nproduced from his box a real silver fox skin. \"I kept it for you'se,\r\nDoctor,\" he said, \"though us hadn't ne'er a bit in t' house. I know'd\r\nyou'd do better 'n we with he.\"\r\n\r\nI promised to try, and on my way called in at some northern islands\r\nwhere my friend, Captain Bartlett, father of the celebrated \"Captain\r\nBob\" of North Pole fame, carried on a summer trade and fishery. He\r\nhimself was a great seal and cod fisherman, and a man known for his\r\ngenerous sympathy for others.\r\n\r\n\"Do your best for me, Captain Will,\" I asked as I handed over the\r\nskin--and on coming South I found a complete winter diet laid out for\r\nme to take to D---- B----'s little house. It was a veritable full load\r\nfor the small carrying capacity of my little craft.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the house on the promontory, however, it was locked\r\nup and the family gone. They were off fishing on the outer islands, so\r\nall we could do was to break in the door, pile up the things inside,\r\nbar it up again, affixing a notice warning off bears, dogs, and all\r\npoachers, and advising Dick that it was the price of his pelt. In the\r\nnote we also told him to put all the fur he caught the following\r\nwinter in a barrel and \"sit on it\" till we came along, if he wanted a\r\nchance to get ahead. This he did almost literally. We ourselves took\r\nhis barrel to the nearest cash buyer, and ordered for him goods for\r\ncash in St. John's to the full amount realized. The fur brought more\r\nthan his needs, and he was able to help out neighbours by reselling at\r\ncash prices. This he did till the day of his death, when he left me,\r\nas his executor, with a couple of hundred good dollars in cash to\r\ndivide among his children.\r\n\r\nIt was experiments like this which led me in later years to start the\r\nsmall coöperative distributive stores, in spite of the knowledge of\r\nthe opposition and criticism it would involve. How can one preach the\r\ngospel of love to a hungry people by sermons, or a gospel of healing\r\nto underfed children by pills, while one feels that practical teaching\r\nin home economics is what one would most wish if in their position?\r\nThe more broad-minded critics themselves privately acknowledged this\r\nto me. One day a Northern furrier, an excellent and more intelligent\r\nman than ordinary, came to me as a magistrate to insist that a trading\r\ncompany keep its bargain by paying him in cash for a valuable fox\r\nskin. They were trying to compel him to take flour and supplies from\r\nthem at prices far in excess of those at which he could purchase the\r\ngoods in St. John's, _via_ the mail steamer.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to act as a justice of the peace for the Colony, I had\r\nthought it my duty to accept the responsibility. Already it had led me\r\ninto a good deal of trouble. But that I should be forced to seize the\r\nlarge store of a company, and threaten an auction of goods for\r\npayment, without even a policeman to back me up, had never entered my\r\nmind. It was, however, exactly what I now felt called upon to do. To\r\nmy intense surprise and satisfaction the trader immediately turned\r\nround and said: \"You are quite right. The money shall be paid at once.\r\nThe truck system is a mistaken policy, and loses us many customers.\"\r\nIt was Saturday night. We had decided to have a service for the\r\nfishermen the next day, but had no place in which to gather.\r\nTherefore, after we had settled the business I took my pluck in my\r\nhands, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It's Sunday to-morrow. Would you lend us your big room for prayers in\r\nthe morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly,\" he replied; and he was present himself and sang as\r\nheartily as any man in the meeting. Nor did he lose a good customer on\r\naccount of his open-mindedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE OF LABRADOR\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the book \"Labrador, the Country and the\r\nPeople,\" the means of transportation to the coast have been so\r\nimproved that each year brings us an increasing number of visitors to\r\nenjoy the attractions of this sub-arctic land. So many misconceptions\r\nhave arisen, however, as to the country and its inhabitants, and one\r\nis so often misrepresented as distorting conditions, that it seems\r\nwise at this point to try and answer a few questions which are so\r\nfamiliar to us who live on the coast as to appear almost negligible.\r\n\r\nThe east coast of Labrador belongs to Newfoundland, and is not part of\r\nthe territory of Canada, although the ill-defined boundary between the\r\ntwo possessions has given rise to many misunderstandings. Newfoundland\r\nis an autonomous government, having its own Governor sent out from\r\nEngland, Prime Minister, and Houses of Parliament in the city of St.\r\nJohn's. Instead of being a province of Canada, as is often supposed,\r\nand an arrangement which some of us firmly believe would result in the\r\nultimate good of the Newfoundlanders, it stands in the same\r\nrelationship to England as does the great Dominion herself. Labrador\r\nis owned by Newfoundland, so that legally the Labradormen are\r\nNewfoundlanders, though they have no representation in the\r\nNewfoundland Government. At Blanc Sablon, on the north coast in the\r\nStraits of Belle Isle, the Canadian Labrador begins, so far as the\r\ncoast-line is concerned. The hinterland of the Province of Ungava is\r\nalso a Canadian possession.\r\n\r\nThe original natives of the Labrador were Eskimos and bands of roving\r\nIndians. The ethnologist would find fruitful opportunities in the\r\ncountry. The Eskimos, one of the most interesting of primitive races,\r\nhave still a firm foothold in the North--chiefly around the five\r\nstations of the Moravian Brethren, upon whose heroic work I need not\r\nnow dilate. The Montagnais Indians roam the interior. They are a\r\nbranch of the ancient Algonquin race who held North America as far\r\nwest as the Rockies. They are the hereditary foes of the Eskimos,\r\nwhole settlements of whom they have more than once exterminated.\r\nGradually, with the influx of white settlers from Devon and Dorset,\r\nfrom Scotland and France, the \"Innuits\" were driven farther and\r\nfarther north, until there are only some fifteen hundred of them\r\nremaining to-day. Among them the Moravians have been working for the\r\npast hundred and thirty-five years. A few bands of Indians still\r\ncontinue to rove the interior, occasionally coming out to the coast to\r\ndispose of their furs, and obtain such meagre supplies as their mode\r\nof life requires. The balance of the inhabitants of the country are\r\nwhite men of our own blood and religion--men of the sea and dear to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon heart.\r\n\r\nDuring the past years it has been the experience of many of my\r\ncolleagues, as well as myself, that as soon as one mentions the fact\r\nthat part of our work is done on the north shore of Newfoundland,\r\none's audience loses interest, and there arises the question: \"But\r\nNewfoundland is a prosperous island. Why is it necessary to carry on a\r\ncharitable enterprise there?\"\r\n\r\nThere is a sharp demarcation between main or southern Newfoundland and\r\nthe long finger of land jutting northward, which at Cape Bauld splits\r\nthe polar current, so that the shores of the narrow peninsula are\r\ncontinuously bathed in icy waters. The country is swept by biting\r\nwinds, and often for weeks enveloped in a chilly and dripping blanket\r\nof fog. The climate at the north end of the northward-pointing finger\r\nis more severe than on the Labrador side of the Straits. Indeed, my\r\nfriend, Mr. George Ford, for twenty-seven years factor of the Hudson\r\nBay Company at Nakvak, told me that even in the extreme north of\r\nLabrador he never really knew what cold was until he underwent the\r\npenetrating experience of a winter at St. Anthony. The Lapp reindeer\r\nherders whom we brought over from Lapland, a country lying well north\r\nof the Arctic Circle, after spending a winter near St. Anthony, told\r\nme that they had never felt anything like that kind of cold, and that\r\nthey really could not put up with it! The climate of the actual\r\nLabrador is clear, cold, and still, with a greater proportion of\r\nsunshine than the northern peninsula of Newfoundland. As a matter of\r\nfact, our station at St. Anthony is farther north and farther east\r\nthan two of our hospitals on the Labrador side of the Straits of Belle\r\nIsle. Along that north side the gardens of the people are so good that\r\ntheir produce affords a valuable addition to the diet--but not so\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: BATTLE HARBOUR]\r\n\r\nThe dominant industry of the whole Colony is its fisheries--the\r\never-recurrent pursuit of the luckless cod, salmon, herring, halibut,\r\nand lobster in summer, and the seal fishery in the month of March. It\r\nis increasingly difficult to overestimate the importance, not merely\r\nto the British Empire, but to the entire world, of the invaluable\r\nfood-supply procured by the hardy fishermen of these northern waters.\r\nOnly the other day the captain of a patrol boat told me that he had\r\njust come over from service on the North Sea, and in his opinion it\r\nwould be years before those waters could again be fished, owing to the\r\nimmense numbers of still active mines which would render such an\r\nattempt disproportionately hazardous. From this point of view, if\r\nfrom no other more disinterested angle, we owe a great and continuous\r\ndebt to the splendid people of Britain's oldest colony. It was among\r\nthese white fishermen that I came out to work primarily, the floating\r\npopulation which every summer, some twenty thousand strong, visits the\r\ncoasts of Labrador; and later including the white resident settlers of\r\nthe Labrador and North Newfoundland coasts as well.\r\n\r\nThe conditions prevailing among some of the people at the north end of\r\nNewfoundland and of Labrador itself should not be confused with those\r\nof their neighbours to the southward. Chronic poverty is, however,\r\nvery far from being universally prevalent in the northern district.\r\nSome of the fishermen lead a comfortable, happy, and prosperous life;\r\nbut my old diaries, as well as my present observations, furnish all\r\ntoo many instances in which families exist well within the danger-line\r\nof poverty, ignorance, and starvation.\r\n\r\nThe privations which the inhabitants of the French or Treaty shore and\r\nof Labrador have had to undergo, and their isolation from so many of\r\nthe benefits of civilization, have had varying effects on the\r\nresidents of the coast to-day. While a resourceful and kindly, hardy\r\nand hospitable people have been developed, yet one sometimes wonders\r\nexactly into what era an inhabitant of say the planet Mars would place\r\nour section of the North Country if he were to alight here some crisp\r\nmorning in one of his unearthly machines. For we are a reactionary\r\npeople in matters of religion and education; and our very \"speech\r\nbetrays us,\" belonging as so many of its expressions do to the days\r\nwhen the Pilgrims went up to Canterbury, or a certain Tinker wrote of\r\nanother and more distant pilgrimage to the City of Zion.\r\n\r\nThe people are, naturally, Christians of a devout and simple faith.\r\nThe superstitions still found among them are attributable to the\r\nremoteness of the country from the current of the world's thought, the\r\nnatural tendency of all seafaring people, and the fact that the days\r\nwhen the forbears of these fishermen left \"Merrie England\" to seek a\r\nliving by the harvest of the sea, and finally settled on these rocky\r\nshores, were those when witches and hobgoblins and charms and amulets\r\nwere accepted beliefs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to-day as a medical man one is startled to see a fox's\r\nor wolf's head suspended by a cord from the centre, and to learn that\r\nit will always twist the way from which the wind is going to blow. One\r\nman had a barometer of this kind hanging from his roof, and explained\r\nthat the peculiar fact was due to the nature of the animals, which in\r\nlife always went to windward of others; but if you had a seal's head\r\nsimilarly suspended, it would turn from the wind, owing to the timid\r\ncharacter of that creature. Moreover, it surprises one to be assured,\r\non the irrefutable and quite unquestioned authority of \"old Aunt Anne\r\nSweetapple,\" that aged cats always become playful before a gale of\r\nwind comes on.\r\n\r\n\"I never gets sea boils,\" one old chap told me the other day.\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I always cuts my nails on a Monday, so I never has any.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a great belief in fairies on the coast. A man came to me once\r\nto cure what he was determined to believe was a balsam on his baby's\r\nnose. The birthmark to him resembled that tree. More than one had\r\ngiven currency if not credence to the belief that the reason why the\r\nbull's-eye was so hard to hit in one of our running deer rifle matches\r\nwas that we had previously charmed it. If a woman sees a hare without\r\ncutting out and keeping a portion of the dress she is then wearing,\r\nher child will be born with a hare-lip.\r\n\r\nWhen stripping a patient for examination, I noticed that he removed\r\nfrom his neck what appeared to be a very large scapular. I asked him\r\nwhat it could be. It was a haddock's fin-bone--a charm against\r\nrheumatism. The peculiarity of the fin consists in the fact that the\r\nfish must be taken from the water and the fin cut out before the\r\nanimal touches anything whatever, especially the boat. Any one who has\r\nseen a trawl hauled knows how difficult a task this would be, with the\r\njumping, squirming fish to cope with.\r\n\r\nProtestant and Catholic alike often sew up bits of paper, with prayers\r\nwritten on them, in little sacks that are worn around the neck as an\r\namulet; and green worsted tied around the wrist is reported to be a\r\nnever-failing cure for hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nEvery summer some twenty thousand fishermen travel \"down North\" in\r\nschooners, as soon as ever the ice breaks sufficiently to allow them\r\nto get along. They are the \"Labrador fishermen,\" and they come from\r\nSouth Newfoundland, from Nova Scotia, from Gloucester, and even\r\nBoston. Some Newfoundlanders take their families down and leave them\r\nin summer tilts on the land near the fishing grounds during the\r\nseason. When fall comes they pick them up again and start for their\r\nwinter homes \"in the South,\" leaving only a few hundreds of scattered\r\n\"Liveyeres\" in possession of the Labrador.\r\n\r\nWe were much surprised one day to notice a family moving their house\r\nin the middle of the fishing season, especially when we learned that\r\nthe reason was that a spirit had appropriated their dwelling.\r\n\r\nStephen Leacock would have obtained much valuable data for his essay\r\non \"How to Become a Doctor\" if he had ever chanced to sail along \"the\r\nlonely Labrador.\" In a certain village one is confidently told of a\r\ncure for asthma, as simple as it is infallible. It consists merely of\r\ntaking the tips of all one's finger-nails, carefully allowed to grow\r\nlong, and cutting them off with sharp scissors. In another section a\r\npowder known as \"Dragon's Blood\" is very generally used as a plaster.\r\nIt appears quite inert and harmless. A little farther south along the\r\ncoast is a baby suffering from ophthalmia. The doctor has only been\r\ncalled in because blowing sugar in its eyes has failed to cure it.\r\n\r\nA colleague of mine was visiting on his winter rounds in a delightful\r\nvillage some forty miles south of St. Anthony Hospital. The \"swiles\"\r\n(seals) had struck in, and all hands were out on the ice, eager to\r\ncapture their share of these valuable animals. But snow-blindness had\r\nincontinently attacked the men, and had rendered them utterly unable\r\nto profit by their good fortune. The doctor's clinic was long and busy\r\nthat night. The following morning he was, however, amazed to see many\r\nof his erstwhile patients wending their way seawards, each with one\r\neye treated on his prescription, but the other (for safety's sake)\r\ndoctored after the long-accepted methods of the talent of the\r\nvillage--tansy poultices and sugar being the acknowledged favourites.\r\nThe consensus of opinion obviously was that the stakes were too high\r\nfor a man to offer up both eyes on the altar of modern medicine.\r\n\r\nIn the course of many years' practice the methods for the treatment\r\nand extraction of offending molars which have come to my attention are\r\nnumerous, but none can claim a more prompt result than the following:\r\nFirst you attach a stout, fine fish-line firmly to the tooth. Next\r\nyou lash the other end to the latch of the door--we do not use knobs\r\nin this country. You then make the patient stand back till there is a\r\nnice tension on the line, when suddenly you make a feint as if to\r\nstrike him in the eye. Forgetful of the line, he leaps back to avoid\r\nthe blow. Result, painless extraction of the tooth, which should be\r\nfound hanging to the latch.\r\n\r\nAlthough there have been clergyman of the Church of England and\r\nMethodist denominations on the coast for many years past--devoted and\r\nself-sacrificing men who have done most unselfish work--still, their\r\nvisits must be infrequent. One of them told me in North Newfoundland\r\nthat once, when he happened to pass through a little village with his\r\ndog team on his way South, the man of one house ran out and asked him\r\nto come in. \"Sorry I have no time,\" he replied. \"Well, just come in at\r\nthe front door and out at the back, so we can say that a minister has\r\nbeen in the house,\" the fisherman answered.\r\n\r\nEven to-day, to the least fastidious, the conditions of travel leave\r\nmuch to be desired. The coastal steamers are packed far beyond their\r\nsleeping or sitting capacity. On the upper deck of the best of these\r\nboats I recall that there are two benches, each to accommodate four\r\npeople. The steamer often carries three hundred in the crowded season\r\nof the fall of the year. One retires at night under the\r\nmisapprehension that the following morning will find these seats still\r\navailable. On ascending the companionway, however, one's gaze is met\r\nby a heterogeneous collection of impedimenta. The benches are buried\r\nas irretrievably as if they \"had been carried into the midst of the\r\nsea.\" Almost anything may have been piled on them, from bales of\r\nhay--among which my wife once sat for two days--to the nucleus of a\r\nchicken farm, destined, let us say, for the Rogues' Roost Bight.\r\n\r\nAs the sturdy little steamer noses her way into some picturesque\r\nharbour and blows a lusty warning of her approach, small boats are\r\nseen putting off from the shore and rowing or sculling toward her with\r\nalmost indecorous rapidity. Lean over the rail for a minute with me,\r\nand watch the freight being unloaded into one of these bobbing little\r\ncraft. The hatch of the steamer is opened, a most unmusical winch\r\ncommences operations--and a sewing machine emerges _de profundis_.\r\nThis is swung giddily out over the sea by the crane and dropped on the\r\nthwarts of the waiting punt. One shudders to think of the probably\r\nfatal shock received by the vertebræ of that machine. One's\r\nsympathies, however, are almost immediately enlisted in the interest\r\nand fortunes of a young and voiceful pig, which, poised in the blue,\r\nunwillingly experiences for the moment the fate of the coffin of the\r\nProphet. Great shouting ensues as a baby is carried down the ship's\r\nladder and deposited in the rocking boat. A bag of beans, of the\r\nvariety known as \"haricot,\" is the next candidate. A small hole has\r\nbeen torn in a corner of the burlap sack, out of which trickles a\r\nwhite and ominous stream. The last article to join the galaxy is a tub\r\nof butter. By a slight mischance the tub has \"burst abroad,\" and the\r\nbutter, a golden and gleaming mass,--with unexpected consideration\r\nhaving escaped the ministrations of the winch,--is passed from one\r\npair of fishy hands to another, till it finds a resting-place by the\r\nside of the now quiescent pig.\r\n\r\nWe pass out into the open again, bound for the next port of call. If\r\nthe weather chances to be \"dirty,\" the sufferers from _mal-de-mer_ lie\r\nabout on every available spot, be it floor or bench, and over these\r\nprostrate forms must one jump as one descends to the dining-saloon for\r\nlunch. It may be merely due to the special keenness of my\r\nprofessional sense, but the apparent proportion of the halt, lame, and\r\nblind who frequent these steamers appears out of all relation to the\r\ntotal population of the coast. Across the table is a man with an\r\nenormous white rag swathing his thumb. The woman next him looks out on\r\na blue and altered world from behind a bandaged eye. Beside one sits a\r\nyoung fisherman, tenderly nursing his left lower jaw, his enjoyment of\r\nthe fact that his appetite is unimpaired by the vagaries of the North\r\nAtlantic tempered by an unremitting toothache.\r\n\r\nBut the cheerful kindliness and capability of the captain, the crew,\r\nand the passengers, on whatever boat you may chance to travel,\r\npervades the whole ship like an atmosphere, and makes one forget any\r\nslight discomfort in a justifiable pride that as an Anglo-Saxon one\r\ncan claim kinship to these \"Vikings of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nLife is hard in White Bay. An outsider visiting there in the spring of\r\nthe year would come to the conclusion that if nothing further can be\r\ndone for these people to make a more generous living, they should be\r\nencouraged to go elsewhere. The number of cases of tubercle, anæmia,\r\nand dyspepsia, of beri-beri and scurvy, all largely attributable to\r\npoverty of diet, is very great; and the relative poverty, even\r\ncompared with that of the countries which I have been privileged to\r\nvisit, is piteous. The solution of such a problem does not, however,\r\nlie in removing a people from their environment, but in trying to make\r\nthe environment more fit for human habitation.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality of the people is unstinted and beautiful. They will\r\nturn out of their beds at any time to make a stranger comfortable, and\r\noffer him their last crust into the bargain, without ever expecting or\r\nasking a penny of recompense. But here, as all the world over, the\r\nsublime and the ridiculous go hand in hand. On one of my dog trips\r\nthe first winter which I spent at St. Anthony, the bench on which I\r\nslept was the top of the box used for hens. This would have made\r\nlittle difference to me, but unfortunately it contained a youthful and\r\nvigorous rooster, which, mistaking the arrival of so many visitors for\r\nsome strange herald of morning, proceeded every half-hour to salute it\r\nwith premature and misdirected zeal, utterly incompatible with\r\nunbroken repose just above his head. It was possible, without moving\r\none's limbs much, to reach through the bars and suggest better things\r\nto him; but owing to the inequality which exists in most things, one\r\ninvariably captured a drowsy hen, while the more active offender\r\neluded one with ease. Lighting matches to differentiate species under\r\nsuch exceptional circumstances in the pursuit of knowledge was quite\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nA visit to one house on the French shore I shall not easily forget.\r\nThe poor lad of sixteen years had hip disease, and lay dying. The\r\nindescribable dirt I cannot here picture. The bed, the house, and\r\neverything in it were full of vermin, and the poor boy had not been\r\nwashed since he took to bed three or four months before. With the help\r\nof a clergyman who was travelling with me at the time, the lad was\r\nchloroformed and washed. We then ordered the bedding to be burned,\r\nprovided him with fresh garments, and put him into a clean bed. The\r\npeople's explanation was that he was in too much pain to be touched,\r\nand so they could do nothing. We cleansed and drained his wounds and\r\nleft what we could for him. Had he not been so far gone, we should\r\nhave taken him to the hospital, but I feared that he would not survive\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nAlthough at the time it often seemed an unnecessary expenditure of\r\neffort in an already overcrowded day, one now values the records of\r\nthe early days of one's life on the coast. In my notebook for 1895 I\r\nfind the following: \"The desolation of Labrador at this time is easy\r\nto understand. No Newfoundlanders were left north of us; not a vessel\r\nin sight anywhere. The ground was all under snow, and everything\r\ncaught over with ice except the sea. I think that I must describe one\r\nhouse, for it seems a marvel that any man could live in it all winter,\r\nmuch less women and children. It was ten feet by twenty, one storey\r\nhigh, made of mud and boards, with half a partition to divide bedroom\r\nfrom the sitting-room kitchen. If one adds a small porch filled with\r\ndirty, half-starved dogs, and refuse of every kind, an ancient and\r\ndilapidated stove in the sitting part of the house, two wooden benches\r\nagainst the walls, a fixed rude table, some shelves nailed to the\r\nwall, and two boarded-up beds, one has a fairly accurate description\r\nof the furnishings. Inside were fourteen persons, sleeping there, at\r\nany rate for a night or two. The ordinary regular family of a man and\r\nwife and four girls was to be increased this winter by the man's\r\nbrother, his wife, and four boys from twelve months to seven years of\r\nage. His brother had 'handy enough flour,' but no tea or molasses. The\r\nowner was looking after Newfoundland Rooms, for which he got flour,\r\ntea, molasses, and firewood for the winter. The people assure me that\r\none man, who was aboard us last fall just as we were going South,\r\nstarved to death, and many more were just able to hold out till\r\nspring. The man, they tell me, ate his only dog as his last resource.\"\r\n\r\nI sent one day a barrel of flour and some molasses to a poor widow\r\nwith seven children at Stag Islands. She was starving even in summer.\r\nShe was just eating fish, which she and her eldest girl caught, and\r\ndrinking water--no flour, no tea, nothing. Two winters before she and\r\nher eldest girl sawed up three thousand feet of planking to keep the\r\nwolf from the little ones. The girl managed the boat and fished in\r\nsummer, drove the dogs and komatik and did the shooting for which they\r\ncould afford powder in winter.\r\n\r\nA man, having failed to catch a single salmon beyond what he was\r\nforced to eat, left in his little boat to row down to the Inlet to try\r\nfor codfish. To get a meal--breakfast--and a little flour to sustain\r\nlife on the way, he had to sell his anchor before he left.\r\n\r\nThe life of the sea, with all its attractions, is at best a hazardous\r\ncalling, and it speaks loud in the praise of the capacity and simple\r\nfaith of our people that in the midst of a trying and often perilous\r\nenvironment, they retain so quiet and kindly a temper of mind. During\r\nmy voyage to the seal fishery I recall that one day at three o'clock\r\nthe men were all called in. Four were missing. We did not find them\r\ntill we had been steaming for an hour and a half. They were caught on\r\npans some mile or so apart in couples, and were in prison. We were a\r\nlittle anxious about them, but the only remark which I heard, when at\r\nlast they came aboard, was, \"Leave the key of your box the next time,\r\nNed.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who claim that Labrador is a land of plenty I would offer the\r\nfollowing incident in refutation. At Holton on a certain Sunday\r\nmorning the leader of the church services came aboard the hospital\r\nsteamer and asked me for a Bible. Some sacrilegious pigs which had\r\nbeen brought down to fatten on the fish, driven to the verge of\r\nstarvation by the scarcity of that article, had broken into the church\r\nillicitly one night, and not only destroyed the cloth, but had\r\nactually torn up and eaten the Bible. In reply to inquiry I gave it\r\nas my opinion that it would be no sin to eat the pork of the erring\r\nquadrupeds.\r\n\r\nOnce when I was cruising on the North Labrador coast I anchored one\r\nday between two desolate islands some distance out in the Atlantic, a\r\nlocality which in those days was frequented by many fishing craft. My\r\nanchors were scarcely down when a boat from a small Welsh brigantine\r\ncame aboard, and asked me to go at once and see a dying girl. She\r\nproved to be the only woman among a host of men, and was servant in\r\none of the tiny summer fishing huts, cooking and mending for the men,\r\nand helping with the fish when required. I found her in a rude bunk in\r\na dark corner of the shack. She was almost eighteen, and even by the\r\ndim light of my lantern and in contrast with the sordid surroundings,\r\nI could see that she was very pretty. A brief examination convinced me\r\nthat she was dying. The tender-hearted old captain, whose aid had been\r\ncalled in as the only man with a doctor's box and therefore felt to be\r\nbetter qualified to use it than others, was heart-broken. He had\r\npronounced the case to be typhoid, to be dangerous and contagious, and\r\nhad wisely ordered the fishermen, who were handling food for human\r\nconsumption, to leave him to deal with the case alone. He told me at\r\nonce that he had limited his attentions to feeding her, and that\r\nthough helpless for over a fortnight, and at times unconscious, the\r\npatient had not once been washed or the bed changed. The result, even\r\nwith my experience, appalled me. But while there is life in a young\r\npatient there is always hope, and we at once set to work on our Augean\r\ntask. By the strangest coincidence it was an inky dark night outside,\r\nwith a low fog hanging over the water, and the big trap boat, with a\r\ncrew of some six men, among them the skipper's sons, had been missing\r\nsince morning. The skipper had stayed home out of sympathy for his\r\nservant girl, and his mind was torn asunder by the anxiety for the\r\ngirl and his fear for his boys.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell, the old captain and I were through with the hardest\r\npart of our work. We had new bedding on the bed and the patient clean\r\nand sleeping quietly. Still the boat and its precious complement did\r\nnot come. Every few minutes the skipper would go out and listen, and\r\nstare into the darkness. The girl's heart suddenly failed, and about\r\nmidnight her spirit left this world. The captain and I decided that\r\nthe best thing to do was to burn everything--and in order to avoid\r\npublicity to do it at once. So having laboriously carried it all out\r\nonto the edge of the cliff, we set a light to the pile and were\r\nrewarded with a bonfire which would have made many a Guy Fawkes\r\ncelebration. Quite unintentionally we were sending out great streams\r\nof light into the darkness over the waters away down below us, and\r\nactually giving the longed-for signal to the missing boat. Her crew\r\nworked their way in the fog to life and safety by means of the blazing\r\nand poor discarded \"properties\" of the soul preceding us to our last\r\nport.\r\n\r\nAlthough our work has lain almost entirely among the white population\r\nof the Labrador and North Newfoundland coasts, still it has been our\r\nprivilege occasionally to come in contact with the native races, and\r\nto render them such services, medical or otherwise, as lay within our\r\npower. Our doctor at Harrington on the Canadian Labrador is appointed\r\nby the Canadian Government as Indian Agent.\r\n\r\nOnce, when my own boat was anchored in Davis Inlet, a band of roving\r\nIndians had come to the post for barter and supplies. Our steamer was\r\na source of great interest to them. Our steam whistle they would\r\ngladly have purchased, after they had mastered their first fears. At\r\nnight we showed them some distress rockets and some red and blue port\r\nflares. The way those Indians fled from the port flares was really\r\namusing, and no one enjoyed it more than they did, for the shouting\r\nand laughter, after they had picked themselves out of the scuppers\r\nwhere they had been rolling on top of one another, wakened the very\r\nhills with their echoes. Next morning one lonely-looking brave came on\r\nboard, and explained to me by signs and grunts that during the\r\nentertainment a white counter, or Hudson Bay dollar, had rolled out of\r\nthe lining of his hat into our woodpile. An elaborate search failed to\r\nreveal its whereabouts, but as there was no reason to doubt him, I\r\ndecided to make up the loss to him out of our clothes-bag. Fortunately\r\na gorgeous purple rowing blazer came readily to hand, and with this\r\nand a helmet, both of which he put on at once, the poor fellow was\r\nmore than satisfied. Indeed, on the wharf he was the envy of the whole\r\nband.\r\n\r\nAt night they slept in the bunkhouse, and they presented a sight which\r\none is not likely to forget--especially one lying on his back on the\r\ntable, with his arms extended and his head hanging listlessly over the\r\nedge. One felt sorely tempted to put a pin into him to see if he\r\nreally were alive, but we decided to abstain for prudential reasons.\r\n\r\nWe had among the garments on board three not exactly suited to the\r\nwhite settlers, so I told the agent to let the Indians have a rifle\r\nshooting match for them. They were a fox huntsman's red broadcloth\r\ntail-coat, with all the glory of gilt buttons, a rather dilapidated\r\nred golf blazer, and a white, cavalryman's Eton coat, with silver\r\nbuttons, and the coat-of-arms on. Words fail me to paint the elation\r\nof the winner of the fox hunting coat; while the wearer of the cavalry\r\nmess jacket was not the least bit daunted by the fact that when he got\r\nit on he could hardly breathe. I must say that he wore it over a\r\ndeerskin kossak, which is not the custom of cavalrymen, I am led to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line from Ramah to Cape Chidley is just under one hundred\r\nmiles, and on it live a few scattered Eskimo hunters. Mr. Ford knew\r\nevery one of them personally, having lived there twenty-seven years.\r\nIt appears that a larger race of Eskimos called \"Tunits,\" to whom the\r\npresent race were slaves, used to be on this section of the coast. At\r\nNakvak there are remains of them. In Hebron, the same year that we met\r\nthe Indians at Davis Inlet, we saw Pomiuk's mother. Her name is\r\nRegina, and she is now married to Valentine, the king of the Eskimos\r\nthere. I have an excellent photograph of a royal dinner party, a thing\r\nwhich I never possessed before. The king and queen and a solitary\r\ncourtier are seated on the rocks, gnawing contentedly raw walrus\r\nbones--\"ivik\" they call it.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos one year suffered very heavily from an epidemic of\r\ninfluenza--the germ doubtless imported by some schooner from the\r\nSouth. Like all primitive peoples, they had no immunity to the\r\ndisease, and the suffering and mortality were very high. It was a\r\npathetic sight as the lighter received its load of rude coffins from\r\nthe wharf, with all the kindly little people gathered to tow them to\r\ntheir last resting-place in the shallow sand at the end of the inlet.\r\nThe ten coffins in one grave seemed more the sequence of a battle\r\nthan of a summer sickness in Labrador. Certainly the hospital move on\r\nthe part of the Moravians deserved every commendation; though I\r\nunderstand that at their little hospital in Okkak they have not always\r\nbeen able to have a qualified medical man in residence.\r\n\r\nOne old man, a patient on whose hip I had operated, came and insisted\r\nthat I should examine the scars. Oddly enough during the operation the\r\nEskimo, who was the only available person whom I had been able to find\r\nto hold the light, had fainted, and left me in darkness. I had\r\npreviously had no idea that their sensibilities were so akin to ours.\r\n\r\nAt Napatuliarasok Island are some lovely specimens of blue and green and\r\ngolden Labradorite, a striated feldspar with a glorious sheen. Nothing\r\nhas ever really been done with this from a commercial point of view;\r\nmoreover, the samples of gold-bearing quartz, of which such good hopes\r\nhave been entertained, have so far been found wanting also. In my\r\nopinion this is merely due to lack of persevering investigation--for one\r\ncannot believe that this vast area of land can be utterly unremunerative.\r\n\r\nOn one of the old maps of Labrador this terse description is written\r\nby the cartographer: \"Labrador was discovered by the English. There is\r\nnothing in it of any value\"; and another historian enlarges on the\r\ntheme in this fashion: \"God made the world in five days, made Labrador\r\non the sixth, and spent the seventh throwing stones at it.\" It is so\r\nnear and yet so far, so large a section of the British Empire and yet\r\nso little known, and so romantic for its wild grandeur, and many\r\nfastnesses still untrodden by the foot of man! The polar current\r\nsteals from the unknown North its ice treasures, and lends them\r\nwith no niggard hand to this seaboard. There is a never-wearying charm\r\nin these countless icebergs, so stately in size and so fantastic in\r\nshape and colouring.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: A LABRADOR BURIAL]\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of the country are so varied and exquisite that\r\none wonders why the world of science has so largely passed us by.\r\nPerhaps with the advent of hydroplanes, Labrador will come to its own\r\namong the countries of the world. Not only the ethnologist and\r\nbotanist, but the archæologist as well reaps a rich harvest for his\r\nlabours here. Many relics of a recent stone age still exist. I have\r\nhad brought to me stone saucepans, lamps, knives, arrow-heads, etc.,\r\ntaken from old graves. It is the Eskimo custom to entomb with the dead\r\nman all and every possession which he might want hereafter, the idea\r\nbeing that the spirit of the implement accompanies the man's spirit.\r\nRelics of ancient whaling establishments, possibly early Basque, are\r\nfound in plenty at one village, while even to-day the trapper there\r\nneeding a runner for his komatik can always hook up a whale's jaw or\r\nrib from the mud of the harbour. Relics of rovers of the sea, who\r\nsought shelter on this uncharted coast with its million islands, are\r\nstill to be found. A friend of mine was one day looking from his boat\r\ninto the deep, narrow channel in front of his house, when he perceived\r\nsome strange object in the mud. With help he raised it, and found a\r\nlong brass \"Long Tom\" cannon, which now stands on the rocks at that\r\nplace. Remains of the ancient French occupation should also be\r\nprocurable near the seat of their deserted capital near Bradore.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Professor Reginald Daly, head of the Department of Geology\r\nat Harvard University, after having spent a summer with me on the\r\ncoast, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We crossed the Straits of Belle Isle once more, homeward bound. Old\r\nJacques Cartier, searching for an Eldorado, found Labrador, and in\r\ndisgust called it the 'Land of Cain.' A century and a half afterward\r\nLieutenant Roger Curtis wrote of it as a 'country formed of frightful\r\nmountains, and unfruitful valleys, a prodigious heap of barren rock';\r\nand George Cartwright, in his gossipy journal, summed up his\r\nimpressions after five and twenty years on the coast. He said, 'God\r\ncreated this country last of all, and threw together there the refuse\r\nof his materials as of no use to mankind.'\r\n\r\n\"We have learned at last the vital fact that Nature has set apart her\r\nown picture galleries where men may resort if for a time they would\r\nforget human contrivances. Such a wilderness is Labrador, a kind of\r\nmental and moral sanitarium. The beautiful is but the visible splendor\r\nof the true. The enjoyment of a visit to the coast may consist not\r\nalone in the impressions of the scenery; there may be added the deeper\r\npleasure of reading out the history of noble landscapes, the\r\nsculptured monuments of elemental strife and revolutions of distant\r\nages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLECTURING AND CRUISING\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had now been coming for some two years to the coast, and the\r\nproblem was assuming larger proportions than I felt the Society at\r\nhome ought to be called on to finance. It seemed advisable, therefore,\r\nto try and raise money in southern Newfoundland and Canada. So under\r\nthe wing of the most famous seal and fish killer, Captain Samuel\r\nBlandford, I next visited and lectured in St. John's, Harbour Grace,\r\nand Carbonear.\r\n\r\nThe towns in Newfoundland are not large. Its sectarian schools and the\r\nstrong denominational feeling between the churches so greatly divide\r\nthe people that united efforts for the Kingdom of God were extremely\r\nrare before the war. Even now there is no Y.M.C.A. or Y.W.C.A. in the\r\nColony. The Boys' Brigade, which we initiated our first year, divided\r\nas it grew in importance, into the Church Lads Brigade, the Catholic\r\nCadet Corps, and the Methodist Guards.\r\n\r\nDr. Bobardt, my young Australian colleague, and I now decided to cross\r\nover to Halifax. We had only a certain amount of money for the\r\nventure; it was our first visit to Canada, and we knew no one. We\r\ncarried credentials, however, from the Marquis of Ripon and other\r\nreputable persons. If we had had experience as commercial travellers,\r\nthis would have been child's play. But our education had been in an\r\nEnglish school and university; and when finally we sat at breakfast at\r\nthe Halifax hotel we felt like fish out of water. Such success as we\r\nobtained subsequently I attribute entirely to what then seemed to me\r\nmy colleague's colonial \"cheek.\" He insisted that we should call on\r\nthe most prominent persons at once, the Prime Minister, the General in\r\ncharge of the garrison, the Presidents of the Board of Trade and\r\nUniversity, the Governor of the Province, and all the leading\r\nclergymen. There have been times when I have hesitated about getting\r\nmy anchors for sea, when the barometer was falling, the wind in, and a\r\nfog-bank on the horizon--but now, years after, I still recall my\r\nreluctance to face that ordeal. But like most things, the obstacles\r\nwere largely in one's own mind, and the kindness which we received\r\nleft me entirely overwhelmed. Friends formed a regular committee to\r\nkeep a couple of cots going in our hospital, to collect supplies, and\r\nsent us to Montreal with introductions and endorsements. Some of these\r\npeople have since been lifelong helpers of the Labrador Mission.\r\n\r\nBy the time we reached Montreal, our funds were getting low, but Dr.\r\nBobardt insisted that we must engage the best accommodations, even if\r\nit prevented our travelling farther west. The result was that\r\nreporters insisted on interviewing him as to the purpose of an\r\nAustralian coming to Montreal; and I was startled to see a long\r\naccount which he had jokingly given them published in the morning\r\npapers, stating that his purpose was to materialize the All Red Line\r\nand arrange closer relations between Australia and Canada. According\r\nto his report my object was to inspect my ranch in Alberta. Life to\r\nhim, whether on the Labrador Coast, in an English school, or in his\r\nAustralian home, was one perpetual picnic.\r\n\r\nNaturally, our most important interview was with Lord Strathcona. He\r\nwas President of the Hudson Bay Company, the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailroad, and the Bank of Montreal. As a poor Scotch lad named Donald\r\nSmith he had lived for thirteen years of his early life in Labrador.\r\nThere he had found a wife and there his daughter was born. From the\r\nvery first he was thoroughly interested in our work, and all through\r\nthe years until his death in 1914 his support was maintained, so that\r\nat the very time he died we were actually due to visit him the\r\nfollowing month at Knelsworth.\r\n\r\nWe hired the best hall and advertised Sir Donald as our chairman. To\r\nsave expense Dr. Bobardt acted in the ticket-box. When Sir Donald came\r\nalong, not having seen him previously, he insisted on collecting fifty\r\ncents from him as from the rest. When Sir Donald strongly protested\r\nthat he was our chairman, the shrewd young doctor merely replied that\r\nseveral others before him had made the same remark. Every one in the\r\ncity knew Sir Donald; and when the matter was explained to him in the\r\ngreenroom, he was thoroughly pleased with the business-like attitude\r\nof the Mission. As we had never seen Canada he insisted that we must\r\ntake a holiday and visit as far west as British Columbia. All of this\r\nhe not only arranged freely for us, but even saw to such details as\r\nthat we should ride on the engine through the Rocky Mountains, and be\r\nentertained at his home called \"Silver Heights\" while in Winnipeg. It\r\nwas during this trip that I visited \"Grenfell Town,\" a queer little\r\nplace called after Pascoe Grenfell, of the Bank of England. The marvel\r\nof the place to me was the thousands and thousands of acres of\r\nsplendid farmland on which no one lived. I promised that I would send\r\nthe hotel-keeper the Grenfell crest.\r\n\r\nLord Strathcona later presented the Mission with a fine little\r\nsteamer, the Sir Donald, purchased and equipped at his expense through\r\nthe Committee in Montreal.\r\n\r\nWe went back to England very well satisfied with our work. Dr. Bobardt\r\nleft me and entered the Navy, while I returned the following year and\r\nsteamed the new boat from Montreal down the St. Lawrence River and the\r\nStraits to Battle Harbour. There the Albert, which had sailed again\r\nfrom England with doctors, nurses, and supplies, was to meet me. We\r\nhad made a fine voyage, visiting all along the coast as we journeyed,\r\nand had turned in from sea through the last \"run,\" or passage between\r\nislands. We had polished our brass-work, cleaned up our decks, hoisted\r\nour flags, all that we might make a triumphant entry on our arrival a\r\nfew minutes later--when suddenly, _Buff--Bur-r--Buff_, we rose,\r\nstaggered, and fell over on a horrible submerged shoal. Our side was\r\ngored, our propeller and shaft gone, our keel badly splintered, and\r\nthe ship left high and dry. When we realized our mistake and the\r\ndreadful position into which we had put ourselves, we rowed ashore to\r\nthe nearest island, walked three or four miles over hill and bog, and\r\nfrom there got a fisherman with a boat to put us over to Battle\r\nHarbour Island. The good ship Albert lay at anchor in the harbour. Our\r\nnew colleagues and old friends were all impatiently waiting to see our\r\nfine new steamer speed in with all her flags up--when, instead, two\r\nbedraggled-looking tramps, crestfallen almost to weeping, literally\r\ncrept aboard.\r\n\r\nSympathy took the form of deeds and a crowd at once went round in\r\nboats with a museum of implements. Soon they had her off, and our\r\nplucky schooner took her in tow all the three hundred miles to the\r\nnearest dry-dock at St. John's.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir Thomas Roddick, of Montreal, an old Newfoundlander, had\r\npresented us with a splendid twenty-foot jolly-boat, rigged with\r\nlug-sail and centre-boom. In this I cruised north to Eskimo Bay,\r\nharbouring at nights if possible, getting a local pilot when I could,\r\nand once being taken bodily on board, craft and all, by a big friendly\r\nfishing schooner. It proved a most profitable summer. I was so\r\ndependent on the settlers and fishermen for food and hospitality that\r\nI learned to know them as would otherwise have been impossible. Far\r\nthe best road to a seaman's heart is to let him do something for you.\r\nOur impressions of a landscape, like our estimates of character, all\r\ndepend on our viewpoint. Fresh from the more momentous problems of\r\ngreat cities, the interests and misunderstandings of small isolated\r\nplaces bias the mind and make one censorious and resentful. But from\r\nthe position of a tight corner, that of needing help and hospitality\r\nfrom entire strangers, one learns how large are the hearts and homes\r\nof those who live next to Nature. If I knew the Labrador people before\r\n(and among such I include the Hudson Bay traders and the Newfoundland\r\nfishermen), that summer made me love them. I could not help feeling\r\nhow much more they gladly and freely did for me than I should have\r\ndreamed of doing for them had they come along to my house in London. I\r\nhave sailed the seas in ocean greyhounds and in floating palaces and\r\nin steam yachts, but better than any other I love to dwell on the\r\nmemories of that summer, cruising the Labrador in a twenty-footer.\r\n\r\nThat year I was late returning South. Progress is slow in the fall of\r\nthe year along the Labrador in a boat of that capacity. I was\r\nweather-bound, with the snow already on the ground in Square Island\r\nHarbour. The fishery of the settlers had been very poor. The traders\r\ncoming South had passed them by. There were eight months of winter\r\nahead, and practically no supplies for the dozen families of the\r\nlittle village. I shall never forget the confidence of the patriarch\r\nof the settlement, Uncle Jim, whose guest I was. The fact that we were\r\nwithout butter, and that \"sweetness\" (molasses) was low, was scarcely\r\neven noticed. I remember as if it were yesterday the stimulating tang\r\nof the frosty air and the racy problem of the open sea yet to be\r\ncovered. The bag of birds which we had captured when we had driven in\r\nfor shelter from the storm made our dry-diet supper sweeter than any\r\nDelmonico ten-course dinner, because we had wrested it ourselves from\r\nthe reluctant environment. Then last of all came the general meeting\r\nin Uncle Jim's house at night to ask the Lord to open the windows of\r\nheaven for the benefit of the pathetic little group on the island.\r\nNext morning the first thing on which our eyes lighted was the belated\r\ntrader, actually driven north again by the storm, anchored right in\r\nthe harbour. Of course Uncle Jim knew that it would be there.\r\nPersonally, I did not expect her, so can claim no credit for the\r\ntelepathy; but if faith ever did work wonders it was on that occasion.\r\nThere were laughing faces and happy hearts as we said good-bye, when\r\nmy dainty little lady spread her wings to a fair breeze a day or so\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe gallant little Sir Donald did herself every credit the following\r\nyear, and we not only visited the coast as far north as Cape Chidley,\r\nbut explored the narrow channel which runs through the land into\r\nUngava Bay, and places Cape Chidley itself on a detached island.\r\n\r\nThere were a great many fishing schooners far north that season, and\r\nthe keen pleasures of exploring a truly marvellous coast, practically\r\nuncharted and unknown, were redeemed from the reproach of selfishness\r\nby the numerous opportunities for service to one's fellow men.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE LABRADOR DOCTOR IN SUMMER]\r\n\r\nOnce that summer we were eleven days stuck in the ice, and while there\r\nthe huge mail steamer broke her propeller, and a boat was sent up to\r\nus through the ice to ask for our help. The truck on my mastheads was\r\njust up to her deck. The ice was a lot of trouble, but we got her into\r\nsafety. On board were the superintendent of the Moravian Missions and\r\nhis wife. They were awfully grateful. The great tub rolled about so in\r\nthe Atlantic swell that the big ice-pans nearly came on deck. My\r\ndainty little lady took no notice of anything and picked her way among\r\nthe pans like Agag \"treading delicately.\" We had five hours' good\r\npush, however, to get into Battle Harbour. It was calm in the\r\nice-field, only the heavy tide made it run and the little \"alive\"\r\nsteamer with human skill beat the massive mountains of ice into a\r\ncocked hat.\r\n\r\nAt Indian Tickle there is a nice little church which was built by\r\nsubscription and free labour the second year we came on the coast.\r\nThere is one especially charming feature about this building. It\r\nstands in such a position that you can see it as you come from the\r\nnorth miles away from the harbour entrance, and it is so situated that\r\nit leads directly into the safe anchorage. There are no lights to\r\nguide sailors on this coast at all, and yet during September, October,\r\nand November, three of the most dangerous months in the year, hundreds\r\nof schooners and thousands of men, women, and children are coming into\r\nor passing through this harbour on their way to the southward. By a\r\nnice arrangement the little east window points to the north--if that\r\nis not Irish--and two large bracket lamps can be turned on a pivot, so\r\nthat the lamps and their reflectors throw a light out to sea. The\r\ngood planter, at his own expense, often maintains a light here on\r\nstormy or dark nights, and \"steering straight for it\" brings one to\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWhile cruising near Cape Chidley, a schooner signalling with flag at\r\nhalf-mast attracted our attention. On going aboard we found a young\r\nman with the globe of one eye ruptured by a gun accident, in great\r\npain, and in danger of losing the other eye sympathetically. Having\r\nexcised the globe, we allowed him to go back to his vessel, intensely\r\ngrateful, but full of apprehension as to how his girl would regard him\r\non his return South. It so happened that we had had a gift of false\r\neyes, and we therefore told him to call in at hospital on his way home\r\nand take his chance on getting a blue one. While walking over the hill\r\nnear the hospital that fall I ran into a crowd of young fishermen,\r\nwhose schooner was wind-bound in the harbour, and who had been into\r\nthe country for an hour's trouting. One asked me to look at his eye,\r\nas something was wrong with it. Being in a hurry, I simply remarked,\r\n\"Come to hospital, and I'll examine it for you\"; whereupon he burst\r\nout into a merry laugh, \"Why, Doctor, I'm the boy whose eye you\r\nremoved. This is the glass one you promised. Do you think it will suit\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\nAnother time I was called to a large schooner in the same region.\r\nThere were two young girls on board doing the cooking and cleaning, as\r\nwas the wont in Newfoundland vessels. One, alas, was seriously ill,\r\nhaving given birth to a premature child, and having lain absolutely\r\nhelpless, with only a crew of kind but strange men anywhere near.\r\nRolling her up in blankets, we transferred her to the Sir Donald, and\r\nsteamed for the nearest Moravian station. Here the necessary\r\ntreatment was possible, and when we left for the South a Moravian's\r\ngood wife accompanied us as nurse. The girl, however, had no wish to\r\nlive. \"I want to die, Doctor; I can never go home again.\" Her physical\r\ntroubles had abated, but her mind was made up to die, and this, in\r\nspite of all our care, she did a few days later. The pathos of the\r\nscene as we rowed the poor child's body ashore for interment on a\r\nrocky and lonely headland, looking out over the great Atlantic,\r\nwrapped simply in the flag of her country, will never be forgotten by\r\nany of us--the silent but unanswerable reproach on man's utter\r\nselfishness. Many such scenes must rise to the memory of the general\r\npractitioner; at times, thank God, affording those opportunities of\r\ndoing more for the patients than simply patching up their\r\nbodies--opportunities which are the real reward for the \"art of\r\nhealing.\" Some years later I revisited the grave of this poor girl,\r\nmarked by the simple wooden cross which we had then put up, and\r\nbearing the simple inscription:\r\n\r\nSuzanne\r\n\"Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe fall trip lasted till late into November, without our even\r\nrealizing the fact that snow was on the ground. Indeed the ponds were\r\nall frozen and we enjoyed drives with dog teams on the land before we\r\nhad finished our work and could think of leaving. We had scarcely left\r\nFlowers Cove and were just burying our little steamer--loaded to the\r\nutmost with wood, cut in return for winter clothing--in the dense fog\r\nwhich almost universally maintains in the Straits, and were rounding\r\nthe hidden ledges of rock which lie half a mile offshore, when we\r\ndiscovered a huge trans-Atlantic liner racing up in our wake. We\r\ninstantly put down our helm and scuttled out of the way to avoid the\r\nwash, and almost held our breath as the great steamer dashed by at\r\ntwenty miles an hour, between us and the hidden shoal. She altered her\r\nhelm as she did so, no doubt catching her first sight of the\r\nlighthouse as she emerged from the fog-bank, but as it was, she must\r\nhave passed within an ace of the shoal. We expected every minute to\r\nsee her dash on the top of it, and then she passed out of sight once\r\nmore, her light-hearted passengers no doubt completely unconscious\r\nthat they had been in any danger at all.\r\n\r\nThe last port of call was Henley, or Château, where formerly the\r\nBritish had placed a fort to defend it against the French. We had\r\ncarried round with us a prospective bridegroom, and we were privileged\r\nto witness the wedding, a simple but very picturesque proceeding. A\r\nparson had been fetched from thirty miles away, and every kind of\r\nhospitality provided for the festive event. But in spite of the warmth\r\nof the occasion the weather turned bitterly cold, the harbour \"caught\r\nover,\" and for a week we were prisoners. When at last the young ice\r\nbroke up again, we made an attempt to cross the Straits, but sea and\r\nwind caught us halfway and forced us to run back, this time in the\r\nthick fog. The Straits' current had carried us a few miles in the\r\nmeanwhile--which way we did not know--and the land, hard to make out\r\nas it was in the fog, was white with snow. However, with the storm\r\nincreasing and the long dark night ahead, we took a sporting chance,\r\nand ran direct in on the cliffs. How we escaped shipwreck I do not\r\nknow now. We suddenly saw a rock on our bow and a sheer precipice\r\nahead, twisted round on our heel, shot between the two, and we knew\r\nwhere we were, as that is the only rock on a coast-line of twenty\r\nmiles of beach--but there really is no room between it and the cliff.\r\n\r\nAll along the coast that year we noticed a change of attitude toward\r\nprofessional medical aid. Confidence in the wise woman, in the seventh\r\nson and his \"wonderful\" power, in the use of charms like green\r\nworsted, haddock fins, or scrolls of prayer tied round the neck, had\r\nbegun to waver. The world talks still of a blind man made to see\r\nnineteen hundred years ago; but the coast had recently been more\r\nthrilled by the tale of a blind man made to see by \"these yere\r\ndoctors.\" One was a man who for seventeen years had given up all hope;\r\nand two others, old men, parted for years, and whose first occasion of\r\nseeing again had revealed to them the fact that they were brothers.\r\n\r\nSome lame had also been made to walk--persons who had abandoned hope\r\nquite as much as he who lay for forty years by the Pool of Siloam, or\r\nfor a similar period at the Golden Gate.\r\n\r\nOne of my first operations had been rendered absolutely inescapable by\r\nthe great pain caused by a tumour in the leg. The patient had insisted\r\non having five men sit on her while the operation proceeded, as she\r\ndid not believe it was right to be put to sleep, and, moreover, she\r\nsecretly feared that she might not wake up again. But now the\r\nconversion of the coast had proceeded so far that many were pleading\r\nfor a winter doctor. At first we did not think it feasible, but my\r\ncolleague, Dr. Willway, finally volunteered to stay at Battle Harbour.\r\nWe loaded him up with all our spare assets against the experiment, the\r\nhospital being but very ill-equipped for an Arctic winter. When the\r\nfollowing summer we approached the coast, it was with real\r\ntrepidation that I scanned the land for signs of my derelict friend.\r\nWe felt that he would be gravely altered at least, possibly having\r\ngrown hair all over his face. When an alert, tanned, athletic figure,\r\nneatly tonsured and barbered, at last leaped over our rail, all our\r\nsympathy vanished and gave way to jealousy.\r\n\r\nOne detail, however, had gone wrong. We had anchored our beautiful Sir\r\nDonald in his care in a harbour off the long bay on the shores of\r\nwhich he was wintering. He had seen her once or twice in her ice\r\nprison, but when he came to look for her in the spring, she had\r\nmysteriously disappeared. The ice was there still. There wasn't a\r\nvestige of wreckage. She must have sunk, and the hole frozen up. Yet\r\nan extended period of \"creeping\" the bottom with drags and grapples\r\nhad revealed nothing, and, anyhow, the water not being deep, her masts\r\nshould have been easily visible. It was not till some time later that\r\nwe heard from the South that our trusty craft had been picked up some\r\nthree hundred miles to the southward and westward, well out in a heavy\r\nice-pack, and right in amongst a big patch of seals, away off on the\r\nAtlantic. The whole of the bay ice had evidently gone out together,\r\ntaking the ship with it, and the bay had then neatly frozen over\r\nagain. The seal hunters laughingly assured me that they found a patch\r\nof old \"swiles\" having tea in the cabin. As the hull of the Sir Donald\r\nwas old, and the size of the boat made good medical work aboard\r\nimpossible, we decided to sell her and try and raise the funds for a\r\nmore seaworthy and capable craft.\r\n\r\nYears of experience have subsequently emphasized the fact that if you\r\nare reasonably resistant, and want to get tough and young again, you\r\ncan do far worse than come and winter on \"the lonely Labrador.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SEAL FISHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning South in the fall of 1895, business necessitated my\r\nremaining for some time in St. John's, where as previously the\r\nGovernor, Sir Terence O'Brien, very kindly entertained me. It proved\r\nto be a most exciting time. There were only two banks in the Colony,\r\ncalled respectively the Union and the Commercial. These issued all the\r\nnotes used in the country and except for the savings bank had all the\r\ndeposits of the fishermen and people. Suddenly one day I was told,\r\nthough with extreme secrecy, that the two banks were unsound and would\r\nnot again open after Monday morning. This was early on Saturday.\r\nBusiness went on as usual, but among the leaders of the country\r\nconsternation was beginning to spread. The banks closed at their usual\r\nhour--three o 'clock on Saturday, and so far as I knew no one profited\r\nby the secret knowledge, though later accusations were made against\r\nsome people. The serious nature of the impending disaster never really\r\ndawned on me, not being either personally concerned in either bank or\r\nhaving any experience of finance. When the collection came around at\r\nthe cathedral on Sunday my friend whispered to me, \"That silver will\r\nbe valuable to-morrow.\" It so happened that on Sunday I was dining\r\nwith the Prime Minister, who had befriended all our efforts, and his\r\ntremendously serious view of the position of the Colony sent me to bed\r\nfull of alarms for my new friends. We were to have sailed for England\r\nnext day and I went down after breakfast to buy my ticket. The agent\r\nsold it, but remarked, \"I am not sure if Newfoundland money is good\r\nany longer. It is a speculation selling you this ticket.\" Before we\r\nsailed the vessel was held up by the Government, as only a few of the\r\nships were taking notes at face value. Those of the Commercial Bank\r\nwere only fetching twenty cents. Besides the banks quite a number of\r\ncommercial firms also closed. The directors of the banks were all\r\nlocal merchants, and many were heavily indebted to them for supplies\r\ngiven out to their \"planters,\" as they call the fishermen whom they\r\nsupply with goods in advance to catch fish for them. It was a sorry\r\nmix-up, and business was very difficult to carry on because we had no\r\nmedium of exchange. Even the Governor to pay his gardener had to give\r\nI.O.U. orders on shops--there simply being no currency available.\r\n\r\nMatters have long since adjusted themselves, though neither bank ever\r\nreopened. Larger banks of good standing came in from Canada, and no\r\none can find anything of which to complain in the financial affairs of\r\nthe \"oldest Colony,\" even in these days of war.\r\n\r\nNewfoundland has a large seal as well as cod fishery. The great\r\nsealing captains are all aristocrats of the fishermen and certainly\r\nare an unusually fine set of men. The work calls for peculiar training\r\nin the hardest of schools, for great self-reliance and resource,\r\nbesides skill in handling men and ships. In those days the doyen of\r\nthe fleet was Captain Samuel Blandford. He fired me with tales of the\r\nhardships to be encountered and the opportunities and needs for a\r\ndoctor among three hundred men hundreds of miles from anywhere. The\r\nresult was a decision to return early from my lecture tour and go out\r\nwith the seal hunters of the good ship Neptune.\r\n\r\nI look back on this as one of the great treats of my life; though I\r\nbelieve it to be an industry seriously detrimental to the welfare of\r\nthe people of the Colony and the outside world. For no mammal bringing\r\nforth but one young a year can stand, when their young are just born\r\nand are entirely helpless, being attacked by huge steel-protected\r\nsteamers carrying hundreds of men with modern rifles or even clubs.\r\nAdvantage is also taken of the maternal instinct to get the mothers as\r\nwell as the young \"fat,\" if the latter is not obtainable in sufficient\r\nquantities. Meanwhile the poor scattered people of the northern shores\r\nof Newfoundland are being absolutely ruined and driven out. They need\r\nthe seals for clothing, boots, fresh food, and fats. They use every\r\nportion of the few animals which each catches, while the big steamers\r\nlose thousands which they have killed, by not carrying them at once to\r\nthe ship and leaving them in piles to be picked up later. Moreover, in\r\nthe latter case all the good proteid food of their carcasses is left\r\nto the sharks and gulls.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock of March 10, 1896, the good ship Neptune hauled out\r\ninto the stream at St. John's Harbour, Newfoundland, preparatory to\r\nweighing anchor for the seal fishery. The law allows no vessels to\r\nsail before 2 P.M. on that day, under a penalty of four thousand\r\ndollars fine--nor may any seals be killed from the steamers until\r\nMarch 14, and at no time on Sundays. The whole city of St. John's\r\nseemed to be engrossed in the one absorbing topic of the seal fishery.\r\nIt meant if successful some fifty thousand pounds sterling at least to\r\nthe Colony--it meant bread for thousands of people--it meant for days\r\nand even weeks past that men from far-away outports had been slowly\r\ncollecting at the capital, till the main street was peopled all day\r\nwith anxious-looking crowds, and all the wharves where there was any\r\nchance of a \"berth\" to the ice were fairly in a state of siege.\r\n\r\nNow let us go down to the dock and visit the ship before she starts.\r\nShe is a large barque-rigged vessel, with auxiliary steam, or rather\r\none should say a steamer with auxiliary sails. The first point that\r\nstrikes one is her massive build, her veritable bulldog look as she\r\nsits on the water. Her sides are some eighteen inches thick, and\r\nsheathed and resheathed with \"greenheart\" to help her in battering the\r\nice. Inside she is ceiled with English oak and beech, so that her\r\nportholes look like the arrow slits of the windows of an old feudal\r\ncastle. Her bow is double-stemmed--shot with a broad band of iron, and\r\nthe space of some seventeen feet between the two stems solid with the\r\nchoicest hardwoods. Below decks every corner is adapted to some use.\r\nThere are bags of flour, hard bread, and food for the crew of three\r\nhundred and twenty men; five hundred tons of coal for the hungry\r\nengine in her battle with the ice-floe. The vessel carries only about\r\neighteen hundred gallons of water and the men use five hundred in a\r\nday. This, however, is of little consequence, for a party each day\r\nbrings back plenty of ice, which is excellent drinking after being\r\nboiled. This ice is of very different qualities. Now it is \"slob\"\r\nmixed with snow born on the Newfoundland coast. This is called \"dirty\r\nice\" by the sealers. Even it at times packs very thick and is hard to\r\nget through. Then there is the clearer, heavy Arctic ice with here and\r\nthere huge icebergs frozen in; and again the smoother, whiter variety\r\nknown as \"whelping ice\"--that is, the Arctic shore ice, born probably\r\nin Labrador, on which the seals give birth to their pups.\r\n\r\nThe masters of watches are also called \"scunners\"--they go up night\r\nand day in the forebarrel to \"scun\" the ship--that is, to find the\r\nway or leads through the ice. This word comes from \"con\" of the\r\nconning tower on a man-of-war.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning of the 10th arrives, all is excitement. Fortunately\r\nthis year a southwest wind had blown the ice a mile or so offshore.\r\nNow all the men are on board. The vessels are in the stream. The flags\r\nare up; the whistles are blowing. The hour of two approaches at last,\r\nand a loud cheering, renewed again and again, intimates that the first\r\nvessel is off, and the S.S. Aurora comes up the harbour. Cheers from\r\nthe ships, the wharves, and the town answer her whistle, and closely\r\nfollowed by the S.S. Neptune and S.S. Windsor, she gallantly goes out,\r\nthe leader of the sealing fleet for the year.\r\n\r\nThere have been two or three great disasters at the seal fishery,\r\nwhere numbers of men astray from their vessels in heavy snow blizzards\r\non the ice have perished miserably. Sixteen fishermen were once out\r\nhunting for seals on the frozen ice of Trinity Bay when the wind\r\nchanged and drove the ice offshore. When night came on they realized\r\ntheir terrible position and that, with a gale of wind blowing, they\r\ncould not hope to reach land in their small boats. Nothing but an\r\nawful death stared them in the face, for in order to hunt over the ice\r\nmen must be lightly clad, so as to run and jump from piece to piece.\r\nWithout fire, without food, without sufficient clothing, exposed to\r\nthe pitiless storm on the frozen sea, they endured thirty-six hours\r\nwithout losing a life. Finally, they dragged their boats ten miles\r\nover the ice to the land, where they arrived at last more dead than\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nIt is the physical excitement of travelling over broken loose ice on\r\nthe bosom of the mighty ocean, and the skill and athletic qualities\r\nwhich the work demands, that makes one love the voyage. Jumping from\r\nthe side of the ship as she goes along, skurrying and leaping from\r\nice-pan to ice-pan, and then having killed, \"sculped,\" and \"pelted\"\r\nthe seal, the exciting return to the vessel! But it has its tragic\r\nside, for it takes its regular tribute of fine human life.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Thomas Green, of Greenspond, while a boy, with his father and\r\nanother man and a 'prentice lad, was tending his seal nets when a\r\n\"dwey\" or snowstorm came on, and the boat became unmanageable and\r\ndrifted off to sea. They struck a small island, but drifted off again.\r\nThat night the father and the 'prentice lad died, and next morning the\r\nother man also. The son dressed himself in all the clothes of the\r\nother three, whose bodies he kept in the boat. He ate the flesh of an\r\nold harp seal they had caught in their net. On the third day by\r\nwonderful luck he gaffed an old seal in the slob ice. This he hauled\r\nin and drank the warm blood. On the fifth day he killed a white-coat,\r\nand thinking that he saw a ship he walked five miles over the floe,\r\nleaving his boat behind. The phantom ship proved to be an island of\r\nice, and in the night he had to tramp back to his open punt. On the\r\nseventh day he was really beginning to give up hope when a vessel, the\r\nFlora, suddenly hove in sight. He shouted loudly as it was dark,\r\nwhereupon she immediately tacked as if to leave him. Again he shouted,\r\n\"For God's sake, don't leave me with my dead father here!\" The words\r\nwere plainly heard on board, and the vessel hove to. The watch had\r\nthought that his previous shouting was of supernatural origin. He and\r\nhis boat with its pitiful load were picked up and sent back home by a\r\npassing vessel.\r\n\r\nOn this particular voyage we were lucky enough to come early into the\r\nseals. From the Conner's barrel, in which I spent a great deal of\r\ntime, we saw one morning black dots spread away in thousands all over\r\nthe ice-floes through which we were butting, ramming, and fighting our\r\nway. All hands were over the side at once, and very soon patients\r\nbegan needing a doctor. Here a cut, there a wrench or sprain, and\r\nlater came thirty or forty at a time with snow-blindness or\r\nconjunctivitis--very painful and disabling, though not fatal to sight.\r\n\r\nOne morning we had been kept late relieving these various slight\r\nailments, and the men being mostly out on the ice made me think that\r\nthey were among the seals; so I started out alone as soon as I could\r\nslip over the side to join them. This, however, I failed to do till\r\nlate in the afternoon, when the strong wind, which had kept the loose\r\nice packed together, dropped, and in less than no time it was all\r\n\"running abroad.\" The result naturally is that one cannot get along\r\nexcept by floating on one piece to another, and that is a slow process\r\nwithout oars. It came on dark and a dozen of us who had got together\r\ndecided to make for a large pan not far distant; but were obliged to\r\ngive it up, and wait for the ship which had long gone out of sight. To\r\nkeep warm we played \"leap-frog,\" \"caps,\" and \"hop, skip, and jump\"--at\r\nwhich some were very proficient. We ate our sugar and oatmeal, mixed\r\nwith some nice clear snow; and then, shaving our wooden seal bat\r\nhandles, and dipping them into the fat of the animals which we had\r\nkilled, we made a big blaze periodically to attract the attention of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nIt was well into the night before we were picked up; and no sooner had\r\nwe climbed over the rail than the skipper came and gave us the best or\r\nworst \"blowing-up\" I ever received since my father spanked me. He told\r\nme afterwards that his good heart was really so relieved by our safe\r\nreturn that he was scarcely conscious of what he said. Indeed, any\r\nwords which might have been considered as unparliamentary he asked me\r\nto construe as gratitude to God.\r\n\r\nOur captain was a passenger on and prospective captain of the S.S.\r\nTigris when she picked up those members of the ill-fated Polaris\r\nexpedition who had been five months on the ice-pans. He had gone below\r\nfrom his watch and daylight was just breaking when the next watch came\r\nand reported a boat and some people on a large pan, with the American\r\nflag flying. A kayak came off and Hans, an Eskimo, came alongside and\r\nsaid, \"Ship lost. Captain gone.\" Boats were immediately lowered and\r\nnineteen persons, including two women and one baby, born on the\r\nice-pan, came aboard amidst cheers renewed again and again. They had\r\nto be washed and fed, cleaned and clothed. The two officers were\r\ninvited to live aft and the remainder of the rescued party being\r\npestered to death by the sealing crew in the forecastle, it was\r\ndecided to abandon the sealing trip, and the brave explorers were\r\ncarried to St. John's, the American people eventually indemnifying the\r\nowners of the Tigris.\r\n\r\nIn hunting my patients I started round with a book and pencil\r\naccompanied by the steward carrying a candle and matches. The invalids\r\nwere distributed in the four holds--the after, the main, forecastle,\r\nand foretop-gallant-forecastle. I never went round without a bottle of\r\ncocaine solution in my pocket for the snow-blind men, who suffered the\r\nmost excruciating pain, often rolling about and moaning as if in a\r\nkind of frenzy, and to whom the cocaine gave wonderful relief. Very\r\noften I found that I must miss one or even both holds on my first\r\nrounds, for the ladders were gone and seals and coals were exchanging\r\nplaces in them during the first part of the day. Once down, however,\r\none shouts out, \"Is there any one here?\" No answer. Louder still, \"Is\r\nthere any one here?\" Perhaps a distant cough answers from some dark\r\nrecess, and the steward and I begin a search. Then we go round\r\nsystematically, climbing over on the barrels, searching under sacks,\r\nand poking into recesses, and after all occasionally missing one or\r\ntwo in our search. It seems a peculiarity about the men, that though\r\nthey will lie up, they will not always say anything about it. The\r\nholds were very damp and dirty, but the men seemed to improve in\r\nhealth and fattened like the young seals. It must have been the pork,\r\ndoughs, and excellent fresh meat of the seal. We had boiled or fried\r\nseal quite often with onions, and I must say that it was excellent\r\neating--far more palatable than the dried codfish, which, when one has\r\nany ice work, creates an intolerable thirst.\r\n\r\nThe rats were making a huge noise one night and a barrel man gave it\r\nas his opinion that we should have a gale before long; but a glorious\r\nsunshine came streaming down upon us next morning, and we decided\r\nperforce the rats were evidently a little previous.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday I had a good chance to watch the seals. They came up, simply\r\nstared at the ship; now from sheer fat rolling on their backs, and\r\nlying for a few seconds tail and flippers beating the air helpless.\r\nThese baby seals resemble on the ice nothing so much as the South Sea\r\nparrot fish--that is, a complete round head, with somewhere in the\r\nsphere two huge black dots for eyes and a similar one for a nose.\r\nThese three form the corners of a small triangle, and except for the\r\ntail one could not easily tell which was the back and which the belly\r\nof a young white-coat--especially in stormy weather. For it is a\r\nwell-ascertained fact that Nature makes the marvellous provision that\r\nin storm and snow they grow fattest and fastest. I have marvelled\r\ngreatly how it is possible for any hot-blooded creature to enjoy so\r\nimmensely this terribly cold water as do these old seals. They paddle\r\nabout, throw themselves on their backs, float and puff out their\r\nbreasts, flapping their flippers like paws over their chests.\r\n\r\nSunday morning we were lying off Fogo Island when some men came aboard\r\nand reported the wreck of the S.S. Wolf in the ice. She got round the\r\nisland, a wind offshore having cleared the ice from the land. Three\r\nother vessels were behind her. Hardly, however, had she got round when\r\nthe northerly wind brought the ice back. The doomed ship now lay\r\nbetween the main or fixed frozen shore ice and the immense floe which\r\nwas impelled by the north wind acting on its whole irregular surface.\r\nThe force was irresistible. The Wolf backed and butted and got twenty\r\nyards into a nook in the main ice, and lay there helpless as an\r\ninfant. On then swept the floe, crashed into the fixed ice, shattered\r\nits edge, rose up out of water over it, which is called \"rafting,\"\r\nforced itself on the unfortunate ship, rose over her bulwarks, crushed\r\nin her sides, and only by nipping her tightly avoided sinking her\r\nimmediately. Seeing that all was lost, Captain Kean got the men and\r\nboats onto the pans, took all they could save of food and clothes, but\r\nbefore he had saved his own clothing, the ice parted enough to let her\r\nthrough and she sank like a stone, her masts catching and breaking in\r\npieces as she went. A sorrowful march for the shore now began over the\r\nice, as the three hundred men started for home, carrying as much as\r\nthey could on their backs. Many would have to face empty cupboards and\r\nhard times; all would have days of walking and rowing and camping\r\nbefore they could get home. One hundred miles would be the least, two\r\nand even three hundred for some, before they could reach their own\r\nvillages. Some of these poor fellows had walked nearly two hundred\r\nmiles to get a chance of going on the lost ship, impelled by hunger\r\nand necessity. Alas, we felt very sad for them and for Captain Kean,\r\nwho had to face almost absolute ruin on account of this great loss.\r\n\r\nThe heaving of the great pans, like battering-rams against the sides\r\nof the Neptune, made a woesome noise below decks. I was often glad of\r\nher thirty-six inches of hardwood covering. Every now and then she\r\nsteamed ahead a little and pressed into the ice to prevent this. I\r\ntried to climb on one of the many icebergs, but the heavy swell made\r\nit dangerous. At every swell it rolled over and back some eight feet,\r\nand as I watched it I understood how an iceberg goes to wind. For it\r\nacted exactly like a steam plough, crashing down onto one large pan as\r\nit rolled, and then, as it rolled back, lifting up another and\r\nsmashing it from beneath. A regular battle seemed to be going on, with\r\nweird sounds of blows and groanings of the large masses of ice.\r\nSometimes as pieces fell off the water would rush up high on the side\r\nof the berg. For some reason or other the berg had red-and-white\r\nstreaks, and looked much like an ornamental pudding.\r\n\r\nAt latitude 50.18, about Funk Island, is one of the last refuges of\r\nthe great auk. A few years ago, the earth, such as there is on these\r\nlonely rocks, was sifted for the bones of that extinct bird, and I\r\nthink three perfect skeletons, worth a hundred pounds sterling each,\r\nwere put together from the remnants discovered. One day the captain\r\ntold me that he held on there in a furious gale for some time. Masses\r\nof ice, weighing thirty or forty tons, were hurled high up and lodged\r\non the top of the island. Some men went out to \"pan\" seals on a large\r\npan. Seven hundred of the animals had been placed on one of them, and\r\nthe men had just left it, when a furious breaking sea took hold of\r\nthe pan and threw it completely upside down.\r\n\r\nI am never likely to forget the last lovely Sunday. We had nearly \"got\r\nour voyage\"; at least no one was anxious now for the credit of the\r\nship. The sunshine was blazing hot as it came from above and below at\r\nthe same time, and the blue sky over the apparently boundless field of\r\nheaving \"floe\" on which we lay made a contrast which must be seen to\r\nbe appreciated. I had brought along a number of pocket hymn-books and\r\nin the afternoon we lay out on the high fore-deck and sang and talked,\r\nunworried by callers and the thousand interruptions of the land. Then\r\nwe had evening prayers together, Catholic and Protestant alike; and\r\nfor my part I felt the nearness of God's presence as really as I have\r\nfelt it in the mysterious environment of the most magnificent\r\ncathedral. Eternal life seemed so close, as if it lay just over that\r\nhorizon of ice, in the eternal blue beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHREE YEARS' WORK IN THE BRITISH ISLES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1897 I was asked by the Council to sail to Iceland\r\nwith a view to opening work there, in response to a petition sent in\r\nto the Board by the Hearn longliners and trawlers, who were just\r\nbeginning their vast fishery in those waters from Hull and Grimsby.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen a smaller vessel, so as to leave the hospital ship free\r\nfor work among the fleets, we set sail for Iceland in June. The fight\r\nwith the liquor traffic which the Mission had been waging had now been\r\nsuccessful in driving the sale of intoxicants from the North Sea by\r\ninternational agreement; but the proverbial whiskey still continued\r\nits filibustering work in the Scotch seaports. As our men at times had\r\nto frequent these ports we were anxious to make it easier for them to\r\nwalk straight while they were ashore.\r\n\r\nWe therefore called at Aberdeen on the way and anchored off the first\r\ndock. The beautiful Seaman's Home there was on the wrong side of the\r\nharbour for the vessels, and was not offering exactly what was needed.\r\nSo we obtained leave to put a hull in the basin, with a first-aid\r\nequipment, refreshments, lounge and writing-rooms, and with simple\r\nservices on Sunday. This boat commenced then and there, and was run\r\nfor some years under Captain Skiff; till she made way for the present\r\nhomely little Fishermen's Institute exactly across the road from the\r\ndocks before you came to the saloons.\r\n\r\nI shall not soon forget our first view of the cliffs of the southern\r\ncoast of Iceland. We had called at Thorshaven in the Faroë group to\r\nsee what we could learn of the boats fishing near Rockall; but none\r\nwere there at the time. As we had no chronometers on our own boat we\r\nwere quite unable to tell our longitude--a very much-needed bit of\r\ninformation, for we had had fog for some days, and anyhow none of us\r\nknew anything about the coast.\r\n\r\nWe brought up under the shadow of the mighty cliffs and were debating\r\nour whereabouts, when we saw an English sailing trawler about our own\r\nsize, with his nets out close in under the land. So we threw out our\r\nboat and boarded him for information. He proved to be a Grimsby\r\nskipper, and we received the usual warm reception which these\r\nYorkshire people know so well how to give. But to my amazement he was\r\nunable to afford us the one thing which we really desired. \"I've been\r\ncoming this way, man and boy, for forty years,\" he assured me. \"But I\r\ncan't read the chart, and I knows no more of the lay of the land than\r\nyou does yourself. I don't use no chart beyond what's in my head.\"\r\n\r\nWith this we were naturally not content, so we sent back to the boat\r\nfor our own sheet chart to try and get more satisfactory information.\r\nBut when it lay on the table in this old shellback's cabin all he did\r\nwas to put down on it a huge and horny thumb that was nearly large\r\nenough to cover the whole historic island, and \"guess we were\r\nsomewhere just about here.\"\r\n\r\nOur cruise carried us all round the island--the larger part of our\r\ntime being spent off the Vestmann Islands and the mouth of Brede Bugt,\r\nthe large bay in which Reikyavik lies. It was off these islands that\r\nEric the Red threw his flaming sticks into the sea. The first brand\r\nwhich alighted on the land directed him where to locate his new\r\nheadquarters. Reikyavik means \"smoking village,\" so called from the\r\nvapours of the hot streams which come out of the ground near by.\r\n\r\nThere is no night on the coast in summer; and even though we were a\r\nMission ship we found it a real difficulty to keep tab of Sundays. The\r\nfirst afternoon that I went visiting aboard a large trawler, the\r\nextraordinary number of fish and the specimens of unfamiliar varieties\r\nkept me so interested that I lost all count of time, and when at last\r\nhunger prompted me to look at my watch I found that it was exactly\r\n1.30 A.M.\r\n\r\nAt that time so many plaice and flatfish were caught at every haul,\r\nand they were so much more valuable than cod and haddock, that it was\r\ncustomary not to burden the vessel on her long five days' journey to\r\nmarket with round fish at all. These were, however, hauled up so\r\nrapidly to the surface from great depths that they had no time to\r\naccommodate the tension in their swimming bladders to the diminished\r\npressure, with the result that when thrown overboard they were all\r\nleft swimming upside down. A pathetic wake of white-bellied fish would\r\nstretch away for half a mile behind the vessel, over which countless\r\nscreaming gulls and other birds were fighting. A sympathy for their\r\nhorribly unprotected helplessness always left an uneasy sinking\r\nfeeling at the pit of my own stomach. The waste has, however, righted\r\nitself in the course of years by the simple process of an increasing\r\nscarcity of the species, making it pay to save all haddock, cod, hake,\r\nling, and other fish good for food, formerly so ruthlessly cast away.\r\n\r\nOne had many interesting experiences in this voyage, some of which\r\nhave been of no small value subsequently. But the best lesson was the\r\noptimism and contentment of one's fellows, who had apparently so few\r\nof the things that only tyrannize the lives of those who live for\r\nthem. They were a simple, kindly, helpful people, living in a country\r\nbarren and frigid beyond all others, with no trees except in one\r\nextreme corner of the island. The cows were literally fed on salt\r\ncodfish and the tails of whales, and the goats grazed on the roofs of\r\nthe houses, where existed the only available grass. There were dry,\r\nhard, and almost larval deposits over the whole surface of the land\r\nwhich is not occupied by perpetual snow and ice. The hot springs which\r\nabound in some regions only suggest a forlorn effort on the part of\r\nNature at the last moment to save the situation. The one asset of the\r\ncountry is its fisheries, and of these the whale and seal fisheries\r\nwere practically handed over to Norwegians; while large French and\r\nEnglish boats fell like wolves on the fish, which the poor natives had\r\nno adequate means of securing for themselves.\r\n\r\nWe were fishing one day in Seyde Fjord on the east coast, when\r\nsuddenly with much speed and excitement the great net was hauled, and\r\nwe started with several other trawlers to dash pell-mell for the open\r\nsea. The alarm of masts and smoke together on the horizon had been\r\ngiven--the sign manual of the one poor Danish gunboat which was\r\nsupposed to control the whole swarm of far smarter little pirates,\r\nwhich lived like mosquitoes by sucking their sustenance from others.\r\nThe water was as a general rule too deep outside the three-mile limit\r\nfor legitimate fishing.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Iceland brings to every one's mind the name of Pierre\r\nLoti. We saw many of the \"pêcheurs d'islande\" whom he so effectively\r\nportrays; and often felt sorry enough for them, fishing as they still\r\nwere from old square-rigged wind-jammers. On some of these which had\r\nbeen months on the voyage, enough green weed had grown \"to feed a\r\ncow\"--as the mate put it.\r\n\r\nOn our return home we reported the need of a Mission vessel on the\r\ncoast, but the difficulty of her being where she was wanted at the\r\nright time, over such an extended fishery ground, was very\r\nconsiderable. We decided that only a steam hospital trawler would be\r\nof any real value--unless a small cottage hospital could be started in\r\nSeyde Fjord, to which the sick and injured could be taken.\r\n\r\nIt was now thought wise that I should take a holiday, and thus through\r\nthe kindness of my former chief, Sir Frederick Treves, then surgeon to\r\nthe King, whose life he had been the means of saving, I found myself\r\nfor a time his guest on the Scilly Islands. There we could divert our\r\nminds from our different occupations, conjuring up visions of heroes\r\nlike Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who lost his life here, and of the scenes\r\nof daring and of death that these beautiful isles out in the Atlantic\r\nhave witnessed. Nor did we need Charles Kingsley to paint for us again\r\nthe visit of Angus Lee and Salvation Yeo, for Sir Frederick, as his\r\nbook, \"The Cradle of the Deep,\" shows, is a past-master in buccaneer\r\nlore. Besides that we had with us his nephew, the famous novel writer,\r\nA.E.W. Mason.\r\n\r\nTreves, with his usual insatiable energy, had organized a grand\r\nregatta to be held at St. Mary's, at which the Governor of the island,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, and a host of visiting big-wigs were to be\r\npresent. One event advertised as a special attraction was a\r\nlife-saving exhibition to be given by local experts from the judges'\r\nstage opposite the grand stand on the pier. This, Mason and I, being\r\nlittle more than ornaments in the other events, decided to try and\r\nimprove upon. Dressed as a somewhat antiquated lady, just at the\r\npsychological moment Mason fell off the pier head with a loud\r\nscream--when, disguised as an aged clergyman, wildly gesticulating,\r\nand cramming my large beaver hat hard down on my head, I dived in to\r\nrescue him. A real scene ensued. We were dragged out with such energy\r\nthat the lady lost her skirt, and on reaching the pier fled for the\r\nboat-house clad only in a bonnet and bodice over a bathing-suit.\r\nAlthough the local press wrote up the affair as genuine, the secret\r\nsomehow leaked out, and we had to make our bow at the prize\r\ndistribution the following evening.\r\n\r\nOnly parts of the winter seasons could be devoted to raising money.\r\nThe general Mission budget had to be taken care of as well as the\r\nspecial funds; besides which one had to superintend the North Sea\r\nwork. Thus the summer of 1897 was spent in Iceland as above described,\r\nand some of the winter in the North Sea. The spring, summer, and part\r\nof the fall of 1898 were occupied by the long Irish trip, which\r\nestablished work among the spring herring and mackerel men from\r\nCrookhaven.\r\n\r\nOn leaving England for one of these North Sea trips I was delayed and\r\nmissed the hospital ship, so that later I was obliged to transfer to\r\nher on the high seas from the little cutter which had kindly carried\r\nme out to the fishing grounds. Friends had been good enough to give me\r\nseveral little delicacies on my departure, and I had, moreover, some\r\nespecially cherished personal possessions which I desired to have with\r\nme on the voyage. These choice treasures consisted of some eggs, a\r\nkayak, a kodak, a chronometer, and a leg of mutton! After I was safely\r\naboard the Mission hospital ship I found to my chagrin that in my\r\nanxiety to transfer the eggs, the kayak, the kodak, the chronometer,\r\nand especially the leg of mutton to the Albert, I had forgotten my\r\npersonal clothing. I appreciated the fact that a soaking meant a\r\nserious matter, as I had to stay in bed till my things, which were\r\ndrenched during my passage in the small boat, were dry again.\r\n\r\nIt was on this same voyage that a man, badly damaged, sent off for a\r\ndoctor. It was a dirty dark morning, \"thick o' rain,\" and a nasty sea\r\nwas running, but we were really glad of a chance of doing anything to\r\nrelieve the monotony. So we booted and oil-skinned, sou'-westered and\r\nlife-jacketed, till we looked like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and felt\r\nmuch as I expect a German student does when he is bandaged and padded\r\ntill he can hardly move, preparatory to his first duel. The boat was\r\nlaunched and eagerly announcing the fact by banging loudly and\r\npersistently on the Albert's side. Our two lads, Topsy and Sam, were\r\nsoon in the boat, adopting the usual North Sea recipe for transit: (1)\r\nLie on the rail full length so as not to get your legs and hands\r\njammed. (2) Wait till the boat bounces in somewhere below you. (3) Let\r\ngo! It is not such a painful process as one might imagine, especially\r\nwhen one is be-padded as we were. The stretcher was now handed in, and\r\na bag of splints and bandages. \"All gone!\" shouted simultaneously the\r\nmate and crew, who had risked a shower bath on deck to see us off; and\r\nafter a vicious little crack from the Albert's quarter as we dropped\r\nastern, we found ourselves rushing away before the rolling waters,\r\nexperiencing about the same sensation one can imagine a young sea-gull\r\nfeels when he begins to fly.\r\n\r\nWhile the skipper was at work in the tobacco locker one morning he\r\nheard a fisherman say that he had taken poison.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got it from the Albert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who gave it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skipper ----\" mentioning the skipper's name.\r\n\r\nAt this the skipper came out trembling, wondering what he had done\r\nwrong now.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see it was this way. Our skipper had a bad leg, so as I was\r\ngoing aboard for some corf mixture, he just arst me to get him a drop\r\nof something to rub in. Well, the skipper here gives me a bottle of\r\nred liniment for our skipper's leg, and a big bottle of corf mixture\r\nfor me, but by mistake I drinks the liniment and gave the corf mixture\r\nto our skipper to rub in his leg. I only found out that there\r\nyesterday, so I knew I were poisoned, and I've been lying up ever\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago did you get the medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a fortnight.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had got it into his head that he was poisoned, and nothing on\r\nearth would persuade him to the contrary, so he was put to bed in the\r\nhospital. For three meals he had nothing but water and a dose of\r\ncastor oil. By the next time dinner came round the patient really\r\nbegan to think he was on the mend, and remarked that \"he began to feel\r\nreal hungry like.\" It was just marvellous how much better he was\r\nbefore tea. He went home to his old smack, cured, and greatly\r\nimpressed with the capacity of the medical profession.\r\n\r\nThe first piece of news that reached us in the spring was that the Sir\r\nDonald had been found frozen in the floe ice far out on the Atlantic.\r\nNo one was on board her, and there was little of any kind in her, but\r\neven the hardy crew of Newfoundland sealers who found her, as they\r\nwandered over the floating ice-fields in search of seals, did not fail\r\nto appreciate the weird and romantic suggestions of a derelict Mission\r\nsteamer, keeping her lonely watch on that awful, deathlike waste. She\r\nhad been left at Assizes Harbour, usually an absolutely safe haven of\r\nrest. But she was not destined to end her chequered career so\r\npeacefully, for the Arctic ice came surging in and froze fast to her\r\ndevoted sides, then bore her bodily into the open sea, as if to give\r\nher a fitting burial. The sealing ship Ranger passed her a friendly\r\nrope, and she at length felt the joyful life of the rolling ocean\r\nbeneath her once more, and soon lay safely ensconced in the harbour at\r\nSt. John's. Here she was sold by auction, and part of the proceeds\r\ndivided as her ransom to her plucky salvors.\r\n\r\nThe money which could be especially devoted to the new steamer for\r\nLabrador, over and above the general expenses, was not forthcoming\r\nuntil 1899, when the contract for building the ship was given to a\r\nfirm at Dartmouth in Devon. The chief donor of the new boat was again\r\nLord Strathcona, after whom she was subsequently named.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 1899, the Strathcona was launched, and christened by Lady\r\nCurzon-Howe. When the word was given to let go, without the slightest\r\nhitch or roll the ship slid steadily down the ways into the water. The\r\nband played \"Eternal Father,\" \"God save the Queen,\" and \"Life on the\r\nOcean Wave.\" Lord Curzon-Howe was formerly commodore upon the station\r\nembracing the Newfoundland and Labrador coast. Lord Strathcona\r\nregretted his enforced absence and sent \"Godspeed\" to the new steamer.\r\n\r\nShe arrived at Gorleston July 18, proving an excellent sea-boat, with\r\nlight coal consumption. She is larger than the vessel in which Drake\r\nsailed round the world, or Dampier raided the Spanish Main, or than\r\nthe Speedy, which Earl Dundonald made the terror of the French and\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1899 the hull of the Strathcona was completely\r\nfinished, and I brought her round, an empty shell, to fit her up at\r\nour Yarmouth wharf; after which, in company with a young Oxford\r\nfriend, Alfred Beattie, we left for the Labrador, crossing to Tilt\r\nCove, Newfoundland, direct from Swansea in an empty copper ore tanker,\r\nthe Kilmorack. On this I was rated as purser at twenty-five cents for\r\nthe trip. Most tramps can roll, but an empty tanker going west against\r\nprevailing winds in the \"roaring forties\" can certainly give points to\r\nthe others. Her slippery iron decks and the involuntary sideways\r\nexcursions into the scuppers still spring into my mind when a certain\r\nPsalm comes round in the Church calendar, with its \"that thy footsteps\r\nslip not.\" We were a little delayed by what is known as wind-jamming,\r\nand we used to kill time by playing tennis in the huge empty hold.\r\nThis occupation, under the circumstances, supplied every kind of\r\ndiversion.\r\n\r\nThe mine at Tilt Cove is situated in a hole in the huge headland which\r\njuts out far into the Atlantic, in the northern end of Newfoundland.\r\nCommunication in these days was very meagre. No vessel would be\r\navailable for us to get North for a fortnight. It so happened,\r\nhowever, that the Company's doctor had long been waiting a chance to\r\nget married, but his contract never allowed him to leave the mine\r\nwithout a medical man while it was working. I therefore found myself\r\nwelcomed with open arms, and incidentally practising in his place the\r\nvery next day--he having skipped in a boat after his bride. The\r\nexchange had been ratified by the captain of the mine on the assurance\r\nthat I would not leave before he returned. It was absolutely essential\r\nthat I should not let the next north-bound steamer go by. The season\r\nwas already far advanced; and yet when the day on which she was due\r\narrived, there was no sign of the doctor and his wife. It was a kind\r\nof Damon and Pythias experience--only Pythias got back late by a few\r\nhours in spite of all his efforts, and Damon would have had to pay the\r\npiper if the captain of the mine had not permitted me to proceed.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE STRATHCONA]\r\n\r\nThe narrow road around the cavernous basin in the cliffs leaves only\r\njust room for the line of houses between the lake in the middle and\r\nthe precipice behind. Only a few years later an avalanche overwhelmed\r\nthe house of Captain Williams, and he and his family perished in it.\r\nDuring the days I was at the mine the news travelled by grapevine\r\ntelegraph that the Mission doctor from England had come to the\r\nvillage, and every one took advantage of it. The plan there was to pay\r\nso much per month, well or ill, for the doctor. The work was easy at\r\nfirst, but by the time I left every living being seemed to me to have\r\ncontracted some disease. For each succeeding day my surgery got\r\nfuller, until on the last morning even the yard and road contained\r\nwaiting patients. Whose fault it was has always been a problem to me;\r\nbut it added a fresh reason for wishing to leave punctually, so that\r\none might not risk outliving one's reputation.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1899, I wrote to my mother: \"We have just steamed into\r\nBattle Harbour and guns and flags gave us a welcome after our three\r\nyears' absence. The hospital was full and looked splendid. What a\r\nchange from the day, now seven years ago, that we first landed and had\r\nonly a partially finished house! What an oasis for patients from the\r\nbleak rocks outside! I never thought to remain so long in this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nHere we boarded the little Mission steamer, but no human agency is\r\nperfect, and even the Julia Sheriden had her faults. Her gait on this\r\nfall voyage was suggestive of inebriety, and at times gave rise to the\r\nanxious sensations one experiences when one sees a poor victim of the\r\nsaloon returning home along a pavement near much traffic.\r\n\r\nWhile in England we had received letters from the north coast of\r\nNewfoundland, begging us to again include their shores in our visits,\r\nand especially to establish a definite winter station at St. Anthony.\r\nThe people claimed, and rightly, to be very poor. One man with a large\r\nfamily, whom I knew well, as he had acted guide for me on hunting\r\nexpeditions, wrote: \"Come and start a station here if you can. My\r\nfamily and I are starving.\" Dr. Aspland wrote that every one was\r\nstrongly in favour of our taking up a Mission hospital in North\r\nNewfoundland. We felt that we should certainly reach a very large\r\nnumber of people whom we now failed to touch, and that careful\r\ninquiries should be made.\r\n\r\nLife on the French shore has been a struggle with too many families to\r\nkeep off actual starvation. For instance, one winter at St. Anthony a\r\nman with a large family, and a fine, capable, self-respecting fellow,\r\nwas nine days without tasting any flour or bread, or anything besides\r\nroast seal meat. Others were even worse off, for this man was a keen\r\nhunter, and with his rickety old single-barrel, boy's muzzle-loading\r\ngun used to wander alone far out over the frozen sea, with an empty\r\nstomach as well, trying to get a seal or a bird for his family. At\r\nlast he shot a square flipper seal and dragged it home. The rumour of\r\nhis having killed it preceded his arrival, and even while skinning it\r\na crowd of hungry men were waiting for their share of the fat. Not\r\nthat any was due to them, but here there is a delightful\r\nsemi-community of goods.\r\n\r\nFish was then only fetching two or three dollars a hundredweight,\r\nsalted and dried. The price of necessities depended on the conscience\r\nof the individual supplier and the ignorance of the people. The truck\r\nsystem was universal; thrift at a discount--and the sin of Ananias an\r\nall too common one; that is, taking supplies from one man and\r\nreturning to him only part of the catch. The people in the north end\r\nof Newfoundland and Labrador were very largely illiterate; the\r\nsectarian schools split up the grants for teachers--as they still most\r\nunfortunately do--and miserable salaries, permitting teachers only for\r\na few months at a time, were the rule.\r\n\r\nI had once spent a fortnight at St. Anthony, having taken refuge there\r\nin the Princess May when I was supposed to be lost by those who were\r\ncut off from communication with us. I had also looked in there each\r\nsummer to see a few patients. My original idea was to get a winter\r\nplace established for our Indian Harbour staff, and I proposed opening\r\nup there each October when Indian Harbour closed, and closing in June\r\nwhen navigation was reopened, Battle Harbour again accessible, and\r\nwhen the man-of-war doctors are more on this section of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe snow was deep on the ground long before our voyage ended. There is\r\nalways a romantic charm about cruising in the fall of the year on the\r\nLabrador. The long nights and the heavy gales add to the interest of\r\nthe day's work. The shelter of the islands becomes a positive joy; the\r\nsense of safety in the harbours and fjords is as real a pleasure as\r\nthe artificial attractions of civilization. The tang of the air, the\r\nyoung ice that makes every night, the fantastic midnight dances of the\r\nNovember auroras in the winter sky, all make one forget the petty\r\nworries of the daily round.\r\n\r\nAs Beattie agreed to stay with me it was with real keenness to sample\r\na sub-arctic winter that in November we disembarked from the Julia\r\nSheriden. We made only the simplest preparations, renting a couple of\r\nrooms in the chief trader's house and hiring my former guide as\r\ndog-driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFIRST WINTER AT ST. ANTHONY\r\n\r\n\r\nNot one of the many who have wintered with us in the North has failed\r\nto love our frozen season. To me it was one long delight. The\r\ndog-driving, the intimate relationships with the people on whom one\r\nwas so often absolutely dependent, the opportunity to use to the real\r\nhelp of good people in distress the thousand and one small things\r\nwhich we had learned--all these made the knowledge that we were shut\r\noff from the outside world rather a pleasure than a cause for regret.\r\n\r\nCalls for the doctor were constant. I spent but three Sundays at home\r\nthe whole time, and my records showed fifteen hundred miles covered\r\nwith dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo dog is so strong and enduring that he is the doyen of\r\ntraction power in the North, when long distances and staying qualities\r\nare required. But for short, sharp dashes of twenty to thirty miles\r\nthe lighter built and more vivacious Straits dog is the speedier and\r\ncertainly the less wolfish. We have attempted crossbreeding our\r\nsomewhat squat-legged Eskimo dogs with Kentucky wolf hounds, to\r\ncombine speed with endurance. The mail-carrier from Fullerton to\r\nWinnipeg found that combination very desirable. With us, however, it\r\ndid not succeed. The pups were lank and weedy and not nearly so\r\ncapable as the ordinary Straits breed.\r\n\r\nThe real Labrador dog is a very slightly modified wolf. A good\r\nspecimen stands two feet six inches, or even two feet eight inches\r\nhigh at the shoulder, measures over six feet six inches from the tip\r\nof the nose to the tip of the tail, and will scale a hundred pounds.\r\nThe hair is thick and straight; the ears are pointed and stand\r\ndirectly up. The large, bushy tail curves completely over on to the\r\nback, and is always carried erect. The colour is generally tawny, like\r\nthat of a gray wolf, with no distinctive markings. The general\r\nresemblance to wolves is so great that at Davis Inlet, where wolves\r\ncome out frequently in winter, the factor has seen his team mixed with\r\na pack of wolves on the beach in front of the door, and yet could not\r\nshoot, being unable to distinguish one from the other. The Eskimo dog\r\nnever barks, but howls exactly like a wolf, in sitting posture with\r\nthe head upturned. The Labrador wolf has never been known to kill a\r\nman, but during the years I have spent in that country I have known\r\nthe dogs to kill two children and one man, and to eat the body of\r\nanother. Our dogs have little or no fear, and unlike the wolves, will\r\nunhesitatingly attack even the largest polar bear.\r\n\r\nNo amount of dry cold seems to affect the dogs. At 50° F. below zero,\r\na dog will lie out on the ice and sleep without danger of frost-bite.\r\nHe may climb out of the sea with ice forming all over his fur, but he\r\nseems not to mind one iota. I have seen his breath freeze so over his\r\nface that he had to rub the coating off his eyes with his paws to\r\nenable him to see the track.\r\n\r\nThe dogs have a wonderful instinct for finding their way under almost\r\ninsurmountable difficulties, and they have oftentimes been the means\r\nof saving the lives of their masters. Once I was driving a distance of\r\nseventy miles across country. The path was untravelled for the winter,\r\nand was only a direction, not being cut or blazed. The leading dog had\r\nbeen once across the previous year with the doctor. The \"going\" had\r\nthen been very bad; with snow and fog the journey had taken three\r\ndays. A large part of the way lay across wide frozen lakes, and\r\nthen through woods. As I had never been that way before I had to leave\r\nit to the dog. Without a single fault, as far as we knew, he took us\r\nacross, and we accomplished the whole journey in twelve hours,\r\nincluding one and a half hours for rest and lunch.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THREE OF THE DOCTOR'S DOGS]\r\n\r\nThe distance travelled and the average speed attained depends largely\r\non other factors than the dog power. We have covered seventy-five\r\nmiles in a day with comfort; we have done five with difficulty.\r\nOrdinary speed would be six miles an hour, but I once did twenty-one\r\nmiles in two hours and a quarter over level ice. Sails can sometimes\r\nbe used with advantage on the komatik as an adjunct. The whole charm\r\nof dog-team driving lies in its infinite variety of experiences, the\r\npersonal study of each dog, and the need for one's strength, courage,\r\nand resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nSouth and north of the little village of St. Anthony where we had\r\nsettled were other similar villages; and we decided that we could make\r\na round tour every second month at least. We soon found, however, a\r\ngreat difficulty in getting started, because we always had some\r\npatients in houses near about, whom we felt that we could not leave.\r\nSo we selected a motherly woman, whom we had learned that we could\r\ntrust to obey orders and not act on her own initiative and judgment,\r\nand trained her as best we could to deal with some of these sick\r\npeople. Then, having borrowed and outfitted a couple of rooms in a\r\nfriend's house, we left our serious cases under her care, and started\r\nfor a month's travel with all the optimism of youth.\r\n\r\nWeight on your komatik is a vital question, and not knowing for what\r\nyou may be called upon, makes the outfitting an art. I give the\r\nexperience of years. The sledge should be eleven feet long. Its\r\nrunners should be constructed of black spruce grown in the Far North\r\nwhere wood grows slowly and is very tough, and yet quite light. The\r\nrunners should be an inch thick, eleven inches high, and about\r\ntwenty-six inches apart, the bottoms rising at the back half an inch,\r\nas well as at the front toward the horns. The laths are fastened on\r\nwith alternate diagonal lashings, are two inches wide, and close\r\ntogether. Such a komatik will \"work\" like a snake, adapting itself to\r\nthe inequalities of the ground, and will not spread or \"buckle.\" Long\r\nnails are driven up right through the runners, and clinched on the top\r\nto prevent splitting. The runners should be shod with spring steel,\r\none inch wide; and a second runner, two and a half inches wide, may be\r\nput between the lower one and the wood, to hold up the sledge when the\r\nsnow is soft. Thus one has on both a skate and a snowshoe at once. The\r\ndogs' traces should be of skin and fastened with toggles or buttons to\r\nthe bowline. Dog food must be distributed along the komatik trail in\r\nsummer--though the people will make great sacrifices to feed \"the\r\nDoctor's team.\"\r\n\r\nClothing must be light; to perspire in cold weather is unpardonable,\r\nfor it will freeze inside your clothes at night. Fortunately warmth\r\ndepends only on keeping heat in; and we find an impervious, light,\r\ndressed canvas best. The kossak should be made with, so to speak, no\r\nneck through which the heat which one produces can leak out. The\r\nheadpiece must be attached to the tunic, which also clips tight round\r\nthe wrists and round the waist to retain the heat. The edges may be\r\nbound with fur, especially about the hood, so as to be soft and tight\r\nabout the face, and to keep the air out. The Eskimo cuts his own hair\r\nso as to fill that function. Light sealskin boots are best for all\r\nweathers, but in very cold, dry seasons, deerskin dressed very soft\r\nis warmer. The skin boot should be sewn with sinew which swells in\r\nwater and thus keeps the stitches water-tight. These skin boots are\r\nmade by the Eskimo women who chew the edges of the skin to make them\r\nsoft before sewing them with deer sinew. The little Eskimo girls on\r\nthe North Labrador coast are proficient in the art of chewing, as they\r\nare brought up from childhood to help their mothers in this way, the\r\nwomen having invariably lost their teeth at a very early age.\r\n\r\nA light rifle should always be lashed on the komatik, as a rabbit, a\r\npartridge, or a deer gives often a light to the eyes with the fresh\r\nproteids they afford, like Jonathan's wild honey. In these\r\ntemperatures, with the muscular exercise required, my strictest of\r\nvegetarian friends should permit us to bow in the House of Rimmon. One\r\nday while crossing a bay I noticed some seals popping up their heads\r\nout of the water beyond the ice edge. I had a fine leading dog bearing\r\nthe unromantic name of Podge, and pure white in colour. But he was an\r\nexcellent water dog, trained not only to go for birds, but to dive\r\nunder water for sunken seals. Owing to their increasing fat in winter,\r\nseals as a rule float, though they invariably sink in summer. On this\r\nparticular occasion, having hitched up the team we crept out to the\r\nice edge, Podge following at my heels. Lying still on the ice, and\r\njust occasionally lifting and waggling one's leg when the seal put up\r\nhis head, he mistook one for a basking brother, and being a very\r\ncurious animal, he again dived, and came up a few feet away. We shot\r\ntwo, both of which Podge dived after and retrieved, to the unbounded\r\njoy both of ourselves and his four-footed chums, who more than gladly\r\nshared the carcasses with him later.\r\n\r\nA friend, returning from an island, was jogging quietly along on the\r\nbay ice, when his team suddenly went wild. A bear had crossed close\r\nahead, and before he could unlash his rifle the komatik had dashed\r\nright onto the animal, who, instead of running, stood up and showed\r\nfight. The team were all around him, rapidly snarling themselves up in\r\ntheir own traces. He had just time to draw his hunting knife across\r\nthe traces and so save the dogs, caring much more for them than he did\r\nfor the prey. Whilst his dogs held the attention of the bear, he was\r\nable, though only a few feet away, to unlash his rifle at his leisure,\r\nand very soon ended the conflict.\r\n\r\nA gun, however, is a temptation, even to a doctor, and nearly cost one\r\nof my colleagues his life. He was crossing a big divide, or neck of\r\nland, between bays, and was twenty miles from anywhere, when his dogs\r\ntook the trail of some deer, which were evidently not far off. Being\r\nshort of fresh food, he hitched up his team, and also his pilot's\r\nteam, leaving only his boy driver in charge, while the men pursued the\r\ncaribou. He enjoined the boy very strictly not to move on any account.\r\nBy an odd freak a sudden snowstorm swept out of a clear sky just after\r\nthey left. They missed their way, and two days later, starving and\r\ntired out, they found their first refuge, a small house many miles\r\nfrom the spot where they had left the sledges. When, however, they\r\nsent a relief team to find the komatiks, they discovered the boy still\r\n\"standing by\" his charge.\r\n\r\nWhen crossing wide stretches of country we are often obliged to camp\r\nif it comes on dark. It is quite impossible to navigate rough country\r\nwhen one cannot see stumps, windfalls, or snags; and I have more than\r\nonce, while caught in a forest looking for our tilt, been obliged\r\nto walk ahead with a light, and even to search the snow for tracks\r\nwith the help of matches, when one's torch has carelessly been left at\r\nhome. On one occasion, having stopped our team in deep snow at\r\nnightfall, we left it in the woods to walk out to a village, only five\r\nor six miles distant, on our snowshoes. We entirely lost our way, and\r\nended up at the foot of some steep cliffs which we had climbed down,\r\nthinking that our destination lay at their feet. The storm of the day\r\nhad broken the sea ice from the land, and we could not get round the\r\nbase of the cliffs, though we could see the village lights twinkling\r\naway, only a mile or two across the bay. Climbing steep hills through\r\ndense woods in deep snow in the dark calls for some endurance,\r\nespecially as a white snow-bank looks like an open space through the\r\ndark trees. I have actually stuck my face into a perpendicular bluff,\r\nthinking that I was just coming out into the open. Oddly enough, when\r\nafter much struggling we had mounted the hill, we heard voices, and\r\nsuddenly met two men, who had also been astray all day, but now knew\r\nthe way home. They were \"all in\" for want of food, and preferred\r\ncamping for the night. A good fire and some chunks of sweet cake so\r\ngreatly restored them, however, that we got under way again in a\r\ncouple of hours, further stimulated to do so by the bitter cold,\r\nagainst which, in the dark, we could not make adequate shelter.\r\nMoreover, we had perspired with the violent exercise and our clothes\r\nwere freezing from the inside out.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: A Hilly Trail\r\n   A KOMATIK JOURNEY]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Crossing a Brook\r\n   A KOMATIK JOURNEY]\r\n\r\nYou must always carry an axe, not only for firewood, but for getting\r\nwater--unless you wish to boil snow, which is a slow process, and apt\r\nto burn your kettle. Also when you have either lost the trail or there\r\nis none, you must have an axe to clear a track as you march ahead of\r\nyour dogs. Then there is, of course, the unfortunate question of food.\r\nBuns baked with chopped pork in them give one fine energy-producing\r\nmaterial, and do not freeze. A sweet hard biscuit is made on the coast\r\nwhich is excellent in one's pocket. Cocoa, cooked pork fat, stick\r\nchocolate, are all good to have. Our sealers carry dry oatmeal and\r\nsugar in their \"nonny bags,\" which, mixed with snow, assuage their\r\nthirst and hunger as well. Pork and beans in tins are good, but they\r\nfreeze badly. I have boiled a tin in our kettle for fifteen minutes,\r\nand then found a lump of ice in the middle of the substance when it\r\nwas turned out into the dish.\r\n\r\nWinter travelling on this coast oftentimes involves considerable\r\nhardships, as when once our doctor lost the track and he and his men\r\nhad to spend several nights in the woods. They were so reduced by\r\nhunger that they were obliged to chew pieces of green sealskin which\r\nthey cut from their boots and to broil their skin gloves over a fire\r\nwhich they had kindled.\r\n\r\nOne great joy which comes with the work is the sympathy one gets with\r\nthe really poor, whether in intelligence, physical make-up, or worldly\r\nassets. One learns how simple needs and simple lives preserve simple\r\nvirtues that get lost in the crush of advancing civilization. Many and\r\nmany a time have the poor people by the wayside refused a penny for\r\ntheir trouble. On one occasion I came in the middle of the night to a\r\npoor man's house. He was in bed and the lights out, and it was bitter\r\ncold. He got out of bed in a trice and went down to his stage carrying\r\nan old hurricane lantern to feed my dogs, while his wife, after he had\r\nlit a fire in the freezing cold room, busied herself making me some\r\ncocoa. Milk and sugar were provided, and not till long afterwards did\r\nI know that it was a special little hoard kept for visitors. Later I\r\nwas sent to bed--quite unaware that the good folk had spent the first\r\npart of the night in it, and were now themselves on the neighbouring\r\nfloor. Nor would a sou's return be asked. \"It's the way of t' coast,\"\r\nthe good fellow assured me.\r\n\r\nAnother time my host for the night had gone when I rose for breakfast.\r\nI found that he had taken the road which I was intending to travel to\r\nthe next village, some fourteen miles distant, just to break and mark\r\na trail for us as we did not know the way; and secondly to carry some\r\nmilk and sugar to \"save the face\" of my prospective host for the next\r\nday, who had \"made a bad voyage\" that year. Still another time no less\r\nthan forty men from Conche marched ahead on a twenty-mile track to\r\nmake it possible for our team to travel quickly to a neighbouring\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nOften I have thought how many of these things would I do for my poorer\r\nfriends. We who speak glibly of the need of love for our neighbours as\r\nbeing before that for ourselves, would we share a bed, a room, or give\r\nhospitality to strangers even in our kitchens, after they had awakened\r\nus in the middle of the night by slinging snowballs at our bedroom\r\nwindows?\r\n\r\nOne day that winter a father of eight children sent in from a\r\nneighbouring island for immediate help. His gun had gone off while his\r\nhand was on the muzzle, and practically blown it to pieces. To treat\r\nhim ten miles away on that island was impossible, so we brought him in\r\nfor operation. To stop the bleeding he had plunged his hand into a\r\nflour barrel and then tied it up in a bag, and as a result the wounded\r\narm was poisoned way up above the elbow. He preferred death to losing\r\nhis right arm. Day and night for weeks our nurse tended him, as he\r\nhovered between life and death with general blood poisoning. Slowly\r\nhis fine constitution brought him through, and at last a secondary\r\noperation for repair became possible. We took chances on bone-grafting\r\nto form a hand; and he was left with a flipper like a seal's, able,\r\nhowever, to oppose one long index finger and \"nip a line\" when he\r\nfished. But there was no skin for it. So Dr. Beattie and I shared the\r\nhonours of supplying some. Pat--for that was his name--has been a\r\nveritable apostle of the hospital ever since, and has undoubtedly been\r\nthe means of enabling others to risk the danger of our suspected\r\nproselytizing. For though he had English Episcopal skin on the palm of\r\nhis hand and Scotch Presbyterian skin on the back, the rest of him\r\nstill remained a devout Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\nAnother somewhat parallel case occurred the following year, when a\r\ndear old Catholic lady was hauled fifty miles over the snow by her two\r\nstalwart sons, to have her leg removed for tubercular disease of the\r\nankle. She did exceedingly well, and the only puzzle which we could\r\nnot solve was where to raise the necessary hundred dollars for a new\r\nleg--for her disposition, even more than her necessity, compelled her\r\nto move about. While lecturing that winter in America, I asked friends\r\nto donate to me any of their old legs which they no longer needed, and\r\nsoon I found myself the happy possessor of two good wooden limbs, one\r\nof which exactly suited my requirements. A departed Methodist had left\r\nit, and the wife's clergyman, a Congregationalist, had handed it to\r\nme, an Episcopalian, and I had the joy of seeing it a real blessing to\r\nas good a Roman Catholic as I know. As the priest says, there is now\r\nat least one Protestant leg established in his parish.\r\n\r\nWe once reached a house at midnight, found a boy with a broken thigh,\r\nand had to begin work by thawing out frozen board in order to plane\r\nit for splints, then pad and fix it, and finally give chloroform on\r\nthe kitchen table. On another occasion we had to knock down a\r\npartition in a tiny cottage, make a full-length wooden bath, pitching\r\nthe seams to make it water-tight, in order to treat a severe\r\ncellulitis. Now it would be a maternity case, now a dental one, now a\r\ngunshot wound or an axe cut with severed tendons to adjust, now\r\npneumonia, when often in solitary and unlearned homes, we would\r\nourselves do the nursing and especially the cooking, as that art for\r\nthe sick is entirely uncultivated on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe following winter I lectured in England and then crossed in the\r\nearly spring to the United States and lectured both there and in\r\nCanada, receiving great kindness and much help for the work.\r\n\r\nAs I have stated in the previous chapter we had raised, largely\r\nthrough the generosity of Lord Strathcona, the money for a suitable\r\nlittle hospital steamer, and she had been built to our design in\r\nEngland. I had steamed her round to our fitting yard at Great\r\nYarmouth, and had her fitted for our work before sailing. While I was\r\nin America, my old Newfoundland crew went across and fetched her over,\r\nso that June found us once more cruising the Labrador coast.\r\n\r\nWhile working with the large fleet of schooners, which at that time\r\nfished in August and September from Cape Mugford to Hudson Bay\r\nStraits, I visited as usual the five stations of the Moravian\r\nBrethren. They were looking for a new place to put a station, and at\r\ntheir request I took their representative to Cape Chidley in the\r\nStrathcona.\r\n\r\nThis northern end of Labrador is extremely interesting to cruise. The\r\ngreat Appalachian Mountain Range runs out here right to the water\r\nedge, and forms a marvellous sea-front of embattled cliffs from two\r\nthousand to three thousand feet in height. The narrow passages which\r\nhere and there run far into the mountains, and represent old valleys\r\nscooped out by ice action, are dominated all along by frowning peaks,\r\nwhose pointed summits betray the fact that they overtopped the ice\r\nstream in the glacial age. The sharp precipices and weather-worn sides\r\nare picked out by coloured lichens, and tiny cold-proof Arctic plants,\r\nand these, with the deep blue water and unknown vistas that keep\r\nconstantly opening up as one steams along the almost fathomless\r\nfjords, afford a fascination beyond measure.\r\n\r\nOnce before in the Sir Donald we had tried to navigate the narrow run\r\nthat cuts off the island on which Cape Chidley stands from the\r\nmainland of Labrador, but had missed the way among the many openings,\r\nand only noted from a hilltop the course we should have taken, by the\r\nboiling current which we saw below, whose vicious whirlpools like\r\nminiature maelstroms poured like a dashing torrent from Ungava Bay\r\ninto the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, with our hearts somewhere near our mouths that we\r\nmade an attempt to get through this year, for we knew nothing of the\r\ndepth, except that the Eskimos had told us that large icebergs drove\r\nthrough at times. We could steam nine knots, and we essayed to cover\r\nthe tide, which we found against us, as we neared the narrowest part,\r\nwhich is scarcely one hundred yards wide. The current carried us\r\nbodily astern, however, and glad enough we were to drive stern\r\nforemost into a cove on one side and find thirteen fathoms of water to\r\nhold on in till the tide should turn. When at last it did turn, and\r\ngot under way, it fairly took us in its teeth, and we shot through, an\r\nimpotent plaything on the heaving bosom of the resistless waters. We\r\nreturned safely, with a site selected and a fair chart of the \"Tickle\"\r\n(Grenfell Tickle).\r\n\r\nWhen winter closed in, I arranged for an old friend, a clerk of the\r\nHudson Bay Company, to stay with me at St. Anthony, and once more we\r\nsettled down in rooms hired in a cottage. We had a driver, a team of\r\ndogs, and an arrangement with a paternal Government to help out by\r\nmaking an allowance of twenty-five cents for medicine for such\r\npatients as could not themselves pay that amount, and in those days\r\nthe number was quite large.\r\n\r\nWhen early spring came the hospital question revived. An expedition\r\ninto the woods was arranged, and with a hundred men and thrice as many\r\ndogs, we camped in the trees, and at the end of the fortnight came\r\nhome hauling behind us the material for a thirty-six by thirty-six\r\nhospital. Being entirely new to us it proved a very happy experience.\r\nWe were quartermasters and general providers. Our kitchen was dug down\r\nin thick woods through six feet of snow, and our main reliance was on\r\nboiled \"doughboys\"--the \"sinkers\" among which, with a slice of fat\r\npork or a basin of bird soup, were as popular as lobster à la Newburg\r\nat Delmonico's or Sherry's.\r\n\r\nThe next summer we had trouble with a form of selfishness which I have\r\nalways heartily hated--the liquor traffic. Suppose we do allow that a\r\nman has a right to degrade his body with swallowing alcohol, he\r\ncertainly has no more right to lure others to their destruction for\r\nmoney than a filibuster has a right to spend his money in gunpowder\r\nand shoot his fellow countrymen. To our great chagrin we found that an\r\nimportant neighbour near one of our hospitals was selling intoxicants\r\nto the people--girls and men. One girl found drunk on the hillside\r\nbrought home to me the cost of this man's right to \"do as he liked.\"\r\nWe promptly declared war, and I thanked God who had made \"my hands to\r\nwar, and my fingers to fight\"--when that is the only way to resist the\r\nDevil successfully and to hasten the kingdom of peace.\r\n\r\nThis man and I had had several disagreements, and I had been warned\r\nnot to land on the premises on pain of being \"chucked into the sea.\"\r\nBut when I tested the matter out by landing quite alone from a\r\nrow-boat, after a \"few wor-r-r-ds\" his coast-born hospitality overcame\r\nhim, and as his bell sounded the dinner call, he promptly invited me\r\nto dine with him. I knew that he would not poison the food, and soon\r\nwe were glowering at one another over his own table--where his painful\r\nefforts to convince me that he was right absolutely demonstrated the\r\nexact opposite.\r\n\r\nMy chance came that summer. We were steaming to our Northern hospital\r\nfrom the deep bay which runs in a hundred and fifty miles. About\r\ntwenty miles from the mouth a boat hailed us out of the darkness, and\r\nwe stopped and took aboard a wrecked crew of three men. They had\r\nstruck our friend's well-insured old steam launch on a shoal and she\r\nhad sunk under them. We took them aboard, boat and all, wrote down\r\ncarefully their tale of woe, and then put the steamer about, pushed as\r\nnear the wreck as we dared and anchored. Her skipper came forward and\r\nasked me what I intended doing, and I told him I was going to survey\r\nthe wreck. A little later he again came to ask permission to go aboard\r\nthe wreck to look for something he had forgotten. I told him certainly\r\nnot. Just before sunrise the watch called me and said that the wrecked\r\ncrew had launched their boat, and were rowing toward the steamer.\r\n\"Launch ours at once, and drive them back\" was an order which our boys\r\nobeyed with alacrity and zest. It was a very uneasy three men who\r\nfaced me when they returned. They were full of bluff at what they\r\nwould do for having their liberties thus interfered with, but\r\nobviously uneasy at heart.\r\n\r\nWith some labour we discovered that the water only entered the wreck\r\nat low tide and forward; so by buoying her with casks, tearing up her\r\nballast deck, and using our own pumps as well as buckets--at which all\r\nhands of my crew worked with a good will, we at last found the hole.\r\nIt was round. There were no splinters on the inside. We made a huge\r\nbung from a stick of wood, plugged the opening, finished pumping her\r\nout, and before dark had her floating alongside us. Late that night we\r\nwere once more anchored--this time opposite the dwelling-house of my\r\nfriend the owner. We immediately went ashore and woke him up. There is\r\na great deal in doing things at the psychological moment; and by\r\nmidnight I had a deed duly drawn up, signed and sealed, selling me the\r\nsteamer for fifty cents. I still see the look in his eyes as he gave\r\nme fifty cents change from a dollar. He was a self-made man, had\r\nacquired considerable money, and was keen as a ferret at business. The\r\ndeed was to me a confession that he was in the plot for barratry, to\r\nmurder the boat for her insurance.\r\n\r\nOn our trip South we picked up the small steamer, and towing her to a\r\nHudson Bay Company's Post we put her \"on the hard,\" photographed the\r\nhole, with all the splintering on the outside, and had a proper survey\r\nof the hull made by the Company's shipwright. The unanimous verdict\r\nwas \"wilful murder.\" In the fall as her own best witness, we tried to\r\ntow her to St. John's, but in a heavy breeze of wind and thick snow\r\nwe lost her at sea--and with her our own case as well. The law decided\r\nthat there was no evidence, and my friend, making out that he had lost\r\nthe boat and the insurance, threatened to sue me for the value.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the story may as well be told here. A year or so later I\r\nhad just returned from Labrador. It used to be said always that our\r\nboat \"brought up the keel of the Labrador\"; but this year our friend\r\nhad remained until every one else had gone. Just as we were about to\r\nleave for England, the papers in St. John's published the news of the\r\nloss of a large foreign-going vessel, laden with fish for the\r\nMediterranean, near the very spot where our friend lived. On a visit a\r\nlittle later to the shipping office I found the event described in the\r\ngraphic words of the skipper and mate. Our friend the consignee had\r\nhimself been on board at the time the \"accident\" occurred. After\r\nprodigies of valour they had been forced to leave the ship, condemn\r\nher, and put her up for sale. Our friend, the only buyer at such a\r\ntime on the coast, had bought her in for eighty dollars.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of November, and already a great deal of ice had made.\r\nThe place was six hundred miles north. The expense of trying to save\r\nthe ship would be great. But was she really lost? The heroics sounded\r\ntoo good to be true. All life is a venture. Why not take one in the\r\ncause of righteousness? That night in a chartered steam trawler, with\r\na trusty diver, we steamed out of the harbour, steering north. Our\r\nskipper was the sea rival of the famous Captain Blandford; and the way\r\nhe drove his little craft, with the ice inches thick from the driving\r\nspray all over the bridge and blocking the chart-room windows, made\r\none glad to know that the good sea genius of the English was still so\r\nwell preserved.\r\n\r\nWhen our distance was run down we hauled in for the land, but had to\r\nlay \"hove to\" (with the ship sugared like a Christmas cake), as we\r\nwere unable to recognize our position in the drifting snow. At length\r\nwe located the islands, and never shall I forget as we drew near\r\nhearing the watch call out, \"A ship's topmasts over the land.\" It was\r\nthe wreck we were looking for.\r\n\r\nIt took some hours to cut through the ice in which she lay, before\r\never we could get aboard; and even the old skipper showed excitement\r\nwhen at last we stood on her deck. Needless to say, she was not upside\r\ndown, nor was she damaged in any way, though she was completely\r\nstripped of all running gear. The diver reported no damage to her\r\nbottom, while the mate reported the fish in her hold dry, and the\r\nhatches still tightly clewed, never having been stirred.\r\n\r\nWith much hearty good-will our crew jettisoned fish enough into our\r\nown vessel to float the craft. Fearing that so late in the year we\r\nmight fail to tow her safely so far, and remembering the outcome of\r\nour losing the launch, we opened the stores on the island, and finding\r\nboth block and sails, neatly labelled and stowed away, we soon had our\r\nprize not only refitted for sea, but also stocked with food, water,\r\nchart, and compass and all essentials for a voyage across the\r\nAtlantic, if she were to break loose and we to lose her. The last\r\norders were to the mate, who was put on board her with a crew, \"If not\r\nSt. John's then Liverpool.\"\r\n\r\nNo such expedient, however, proved necessary. Though we had sixty\r\nfathoms of anchor chain on each of our wire cables to the ship, we\r\nbroke one in a seaway and had to haul under the lee of some cliffs and\r\nrepair damages. Often for hours together the vessel by day and her\r\nlights by night would disappear, and our hearts would jump into our\r\nmouths for fear we might yet fail. But at last, with all our bunting\r\nup, and both ships dressed as if for a holiday, we proudly entered the\r\nNarrows of St. John's, the cynosure of all eyes. The skipper and our\r\nfriend had gone to England, so the Government had them extradited. The\r\ncaptain, who was ill with a fatal disease, made a full confession, and\r\nboth men were sent to prison.\r\n\r\nThat was how we \"went dry\" in our section of Labrador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE COÖPERATIVE MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a professional and not a business man, and having no\r\nacquaintance with the ways of trade, the importance of a new economic\r\nsystem as one of the most permanent messages of helpfulness to the\r\ncoast was not at first obvious to me. But the ubiquitous barter\r\nsystem, which always left the poor men the worst end of the bargain,\r\nis as subtle a danger as can face a community--subtle because it\r\nimpoverishes and enslaves the victims, and then makes them love their\r\nchains.\r\n\r\nAs a magistrate I once heard a case where a poor man paid one hundred\r\ndollars in cash to his trader in the fall to get him a new net. The\r\ntrader could not procure the twine, and when spring arrived the man\r\ncame to get on credit his usual advance of \"tings.\" From the bill for\r\nthese the trader deducted the hundred dollars cash, upon which the man\r\nactually came to me as a justice of the peace to have him punished!\r\n\r\nLord Strathcona told me that in his day on this coast, when a man had\r\nmade so good a hunt that he had purchased all he could think of, he\r\nwould go round to the store again asking how much money was still due\r\nhim. He would then take up purchases to exceed it by a moderate\r\nmargin, saying that he liked to keep his name on the Company's books.\r\nIn those days the people felt that they had the best part of the\r\nbargain if they were always a little in debt. The tendency to thrift\r\nwas thus annihilated. The fishermen simply turned in all their catch\r\nto the merchant, and took what was coming to them as a matter of\r\ncourse. Many even were afraid to ask for certain supplies. This fact\r\noften became evident when we were trying to order special diets--the\r\npatient would reply, \"Our trader won't give out that.\" Naturally the\r\nwhole system horrified us, as being the nearest possible approach to\r\nEnglish slavery, for the poor man was in constant fear that the\r\nmerchant \"will turn me off.\" On the other hand, the traders took\r\nprecautions that their \"dealers\" should not be able to leave them,\r\nsuch as not selling them traps outright for furring, or nets for\r\nfishing, but only loaning them, and having them periodically returned.\r\nThis method insured their securing all the fur caught, because legally\r\na share of the catch belonged to them in return for the loan of the\r\ntrap. They thus completely minimized the chance for competition, which\r\nis \"the life of trade.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival on the coast I saw the old Hudson Bay Company's\r\nplan of paying in bone counters of various colours; and a large lumber\r\ncompany paying its wages in tin money, stamped \"Only valuable at our\r\nstore.\" If, to counteract this handicap, the men sold fish or fur for\r\ncash to outsiders, and their suppliers found it out, they would punish\r\nthem severely.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, sitting by me on a gunning point where we were\r\nshooting ducks as they flew by on their fall migration, was a friend\r\nwho had given me much help in building one of our hospitals. I\r\nsuddenly noticed that he did not fire at a wonderful flock of eiders\r\nwhich went right over our heads. \"What's the matter, Jim?\" I asked. \"I\r\nsettled with the merchant to-day,\" he replied, \"and he won't give me\r\nnothing for powder. A duck or two won't matter. 'Tis the children I'm\r\nminding.\" The fishery had been poor, and not having enough to meet his\r\nadvances, he had sold a few quintals of fish for cash, so as to get\r\nthings like milk which he would not be allowed on winter credit, and\r\nhad been caught doing so. He was a grown man and the father of four\r\nchildren. We went to his trader to find out how much he was in debt.\r\nThe man's account on the books was shown us, and it read over three\r\nthousand dollars against our friend. It had been carried on for many\r\nyears. A year or two later when the merchant himself went bankrupt\r\nwith a debt of $686,000 to the bank of which he was a director, the\r\npeople of that village, some four hundred and eleven souls in all,\r\nowed his firm $64,000, an asset returned as value nil. The whole thing\r\nseemed a nightmare to any one who cared about these people.\r\n\r\nIn Labrador no cereals are grown and the summer frosts make potato and\r\nturnip crops precarious, so that the tops of the latter are\r\npractically all the green food to which we can aspire--except for the\r\nfew families who remain at the heads of the long bays all summer, far\r\nremoved from the polar current. Furthermore, until some one invents a\r\nway to extract the fishy taste from our fish oils, we must import our\r\nedible fats; for the Labrador dogs will not permit cows or even goats\r\nto live near them. I have heard only this week that a process has just\r\nbeen discovered in California for making a pleasant tasting butter out\r\nof fish oil. Our \"sweetness\" must all be imported, for none of our\r\nnative berries are naturally sweet, and we can grow no cultivated\r\nfruits. The same fact applies to cotton and wool. Thus nearly all our\r\nnecessities of life have to be brought to us. Firewood, lumber, fish\r\nand game, boots or clothing of skins, are all that we can provide for\r\nourselves. On the other hand, we must export our codfish, salmon,\r\ntrout, whales, oil, fur, and in fact practically all our products. An\r\nexchange medium is therefore imperative; and we must have some gauge\r\nlike cash by which to measure, or else we shall lose on all\r\ntransactions; for all the prices of both exports and imports fluctuate\r\nvery rapidly, and besides this, we had then practically no way to find\r\nout what prices were maintaining in our markets.\r\n\r\nGovernment relief had failed to stop the evils of the barter system.\r\nIn the opinion of thinking men it only made matters worse. We were\r\ntherefore from every point of view encouraged to start the coöperative\r\nplan which had proved so successful in England. I still believe that\r\nthe people are honest, and that the laziness of indolence, from the\r\nstigma of which it is often impossible to clear them, is due to\r\ndespair and inability to work properly owing to imperfect nourishment.\r\n\r\nThings went from bad to worse as the years went by. The fact of the\r\nsealing steamers killing the young seals before they could swim\r\ngreatly impoverished the Labrador inshore seal fishery. The prices of\r\nfish were so low that a man could scarcely catch enough to pay for his\r\nsummer expenses out of it.\r\n\r\nWith us the matter came to a head in a little fishing village called\r\nRed Bay, on the north side of the Straits of Belle Isle. When we ran\r\nin there on our last visit one fall, we found some of our good friends\r\npacked up and waiting on their stages to see if we would remove them\r\nfrom the coast. A meeting was called that night to consider the\r\nproblem, and it was decided that the people must try to be their own\r\nmerchants, accepting the risks and sharing the profits. The\r\nfisherman's and trapper's life is a gamble, and naturally, therefore,\r\nthey like credit advances, for it makes the other man carry the risks.\r\nWe then and there decided, however, to venture a coöperative store,\r\nhiring a schooner to bring our freight and carry our produce straight\r\nto market; and if necessary eat grass for a year or so. Alas, after\r\na year's saving the seventeen families could raise only eighty-five\r\ndollars among them for capital, and we had to loan them sufficient to\r\nobtain the first cargo. A young fisherman was chosen as secretary, and\r\nthe store worked well from the beginning. That was in 1905. He is\r\nstill secretary, and to-day in 1918 the five-dollar shares are worth\r\none hundred and four dollars each, by the simple process of\r\naccumulation of profits. The loan has been repaid years ago. Not a\r\nbarrow load of fish leaves the harbour except through the coöperative\r\nstore. Due to it, the people have been able to tide over a series of\r\nbad fisheries; and every family is free of debt.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE FIRST COÖPERATIVE STORE]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the formation one most significant fact was that every\r\nshareholder insisted that his name must not be registered, for fear\r\nsome one might find out that he owned cash. They were even opposed to\r\na label on the building to signify that it was a store. However, I\r\nchalked all over its face \"Red Bay Coöperative Store.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole effort met with very severe criticism, not to say hostility,\r\nat the hands of the smaller traders, but the larger merchants were\r\nmost generous in their attitude, and though doubtful of the\r\npossibility of realizing a cash basis, were without exception\r\nfavourable to the attempt. This store has been an unqualified success,\r\nonly limited in its blessings by its lack of larger capital. It has\r\nenabled its members to live independently, free of debt and without\r\nwant; while similar villages, both south and east and west, have been\r\ngradually deleted by the people being forced to leave through\r\ninability to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nDuring my first winter at St. Anthony, the young minister of the\r\nlittle church on more than one occasion happened to be visiting on his\r\nrounds in the very house where we were staying on ours, and the\r\nsubject of coöperation was frequently discussed over the evening pipe\r\nwith the friends in the place. He had himself been trading, and had so\r\ndisliked the methods that he had retired. He would certainly help us\r\nto organize a store on the Newfoundland side of the Straits.\r\n\r\nAt last the day arrived for the initial meeting. We gave notice\r\neverywhere. The chosen rendezvous was in a village fourteen miles\r\nnorth. The evening before, however, the minister sent word that he\r\ncould not be present, as he had to go to a place twenty miles to the\r\nnorthwest to hold service. Knowing for how much his opinion counted in\r\nthe minds of some of the people, this was a heavy blow, especially as\r\nthe traders had notified me that they would all be on hand.\r\nFortunately an ingenious suggestion was made--\"He doesn't know the\r\nway. Persuade his driver, after starting out, to gradually work round\r\nand end up at the coöperative meeting.\" This was actually done, and\r\nour friend was present willy-nilly. He proved a broken reed, however,\r\nfor in the face of the traders he went back on coöperation.\r\n\r\nAs fortune would have it, our own komatik fell through the ice in\r\ntaking a short cut across a bay, and we arrived late, having had to\r\nborrow some dry clothing from a fisherman on the way. Our trader\r\nfriends had already appeared on the scene, and were joking the parson\r\nfor being tricked, saying that evidently we had made a mistake and\r\nwere really at Cape Norman, the place to which he had intended to go.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark evening, crisp and cold, and hundreds of dogs that had\r\nhauled people from all over the countryside to the meeting made night\r\ndismal outside. We began our meeting with prayer for guidance, wisdom,\r\nand good temper, for we knew that we should need them all--and then\r\nwe came down to statistics, prices, debts, possibilities, and the\r\nstory of coöperation elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe little house was crammed to overflowing. But the fear of the old\r\nrégime was heavy on the meeting. The traders occupied the whole time\r\nfor speaking. Only one old fisherman spoke at all. He had been an\r\noverseas sailor in his early days, and he surprised himself by turning\r\norator. His effort elicited great applause. \"Doctor--I means Mr.\r\nChairman--if this here copper store buys a bar'l of flour in St.\r\nJohn's for five dollars, be it going to sell it to we fer ten? That's\r\nwhat us wants to know.\"\r\n\r\nOutside, after the meeting, Babel was let loose. The general opinion\r\nwas that there must be something to it or the traders would not have\r\nso much to say against the project. The upshot of the matter was that\r\nfor a long time no one could be found who would take the managership;\r\nbut at length the best-beloved fisherman on the shore stepped into the\r\nbreach. He was not a scholar--in fact could scarcely read, write, and\r\nfigure--but his pluck, optimism, and unselfishness carried him\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThat little store has been preaching its vital truths ever since. It is\r\na still small text, but it has had vast influences for good. There has\r\nproved to be one difficulty. It is the custom on the coast to give all\r\nmeals to travellers free, both men and dogs, and lodging to boot.\r\nCustomers came from so far away that they had to stay overnight at\r\nleast, and of course it was always Harry's house to which they went. The\r\nprofit on a twenty-five cent purchase was slender under these\r\ncircumstances, and as cash was scarce in those days, a twenty-five-cent\r\npurchase was not so rare as might be supposed. We therefore printed,\r\nmounted, framed, and sent to our friend the legend, \"No more free meals.\r\nEach meal will cost ten cents.\" Later we received a most grateful reply\r\nfrom him in his merry way, saying that he had hung up the card in his\r\nparlour, but begging us not to defer visits if we had not the requisite\r\namount, as he was permitted to give credit to that extent. But when next\r\nwe suddenly \"blew in\" to Harry's house, the legend was hanging with its\r\nface to the wall.\r\n\r\nOur third store was seventy-five miles to the westward at a place\r\ncalled Flowers Cove. Here the parson came in with a will. Being a\r\nChurch of England man, he was a more permanent resident, and, as he\r\nsaid, \"he was a poor man, but he would sell his extra pair of boots to\r\nbe able to put one more share in the store.\" What was infinitely more\r\nimportant he put in his brains. Every one in that vicinity who had\r\nfelt the slavery of the old system joined the venture. One poor\r\nIrishman walked several miles around the coast to catch me on my next\r\nvisit, and secretly give me five dollars. \"'Tis all I has in the\r\nworld, Doctor, saving a bunch of children, but if it was ten times as\r\nlarge, you should have every cent of it for the store.\" \"Thanks,\r\nPaddy, that's the talking that tells.\" For some years afterwards,\r\nevery time that he knew I was making a visit to that part of the\r\ncoast, he would come around seeking a private interview, and inquire\r\nafter the health of \"the copper store\"; till he triumphantly brought\r\nanother five dollars for a second share \"out of my profits, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThat store is now a limited liability company with a capital of ten\r\nthousand dollars owned entirely by the fishermen, it has paid\r\nconsistently a ten per cent dividend every year, and is located in\r\nfine premises which it bought and owns outright.\r\n\r\nA fourth store followed near the lumber mill which we started to give\r\nwinter labour at logging; but owing to bad management and lack of\r\nability to say \"no\" to men seeking credit, it fell into debt and we\r\nclosed it up. Number five almost shared the same fate. Unable to get\r\nlocal talent to manage it, we hired a Canadian whose pretensions\r\nproved unequal to his responsibility. He was, however, found out in\r\ntime to reorganize the store; but the loss which he had caused was\r\nheavy, and it was his notice of leaving for Canada which alone\r\nbetrayed the truth to us. The most serious aspect of the matter was\r\nthat many of the local fishermen lost confidence in the ability of the\r\nstore to succeed, and returning to the credit system, they found it\r\nmodified enough to appear to them a lamb instead of a wolf. However,\r\nnumber five is growing all the time again and will yet be a factor in\r\nthe people's deliverance.\r\n\r\nNumbers six and seven were in poor and remote parts of Labrador, very\r\nsmall, and with insufficient capital and brains. One has closed\r\npermanently. They were simply small stores under the care of one\r\nsettler, who guaranteed to charge the people only a fixed percentage\r\nover St. John's prices for goods, as the return for his\r\nresponsibility. Number eight was the result of a night spent in a\r\nmiserable shack on a lonely promontory called Adlavik.\r\n\r\nGod forbid that I should judge traders or doctors or lawyers or\r\npriests by their profession or their intellectual attitude. There are\r\nnoble men in all walks of life. Alas, some are more liable than others\r\nto yield to temptation, and the temptations to which they are exposed\r\nare more insistent.\r\n\r\nNumber nine was on the extreme northern edge of the white settlers at\r\nFord's Harbour. The story of it is too long to relate, but the trade\r\nthere, in spite of many difficulties, still continues to preach a\r\ngospel and spell much blessing to poor people. To help out, we have\r\nsent north to this station three of our boys from the orphanage, as\r\nthey grew old enough to go out into the world for themselves.\r\n\r\nOne disaster, in the form of a shipwreck, overtook the fine fellow in\r\ncharge of this most northerly venture. For the first time in his life\r\nhe came south, to seek a wife, his former wife having succumbed to\r\ntuberculosis. He brought with him his year's products of fur and skin\r\nboots. The mail steamer on which he was travelling struck a rock off\r\nBattle Harbour, and most of his goods were lost uninsured, he himself\r\ngladly enough escaping with his life.\r\n\r\nIt remained for our tenth venture to bring the hardest battle, and in\r\na sense the greatest measure of success. Spurred by the benefits of\r\nthe Red Bay store, the people of a little village about forty miles\r\naway determined to combine also. The result was a fine store near our\r\nhospital at Battle Harbour--which during the first year did sixty\r\nthousand dollars' worth of business. This served to put a match to the\r\nexplosive wrath of those whose opposition hitherto had been that of\r\nrats behind a wainscot. They secured from their friends a Government\r\ncommission appointed to inquire into the work of the Mission as \"a\r\nmenace to honest trade.\" The leading petitioner had been the best of\r\nhelpers to the first venture. When the traders affected by it had\r\nfirst boycotted the fish, he had sent his steamer and purchased it\r\nfrom the company. Now the boot was on the other leg. The Commission\r\nand even the lawyers have all told me that they were prejudiced\r\nagainst the whole Mission by hearsay and misinterpretations, before\r\nthey even began their exhaustive inquiry. Their findings, however,\r\nwere a complete refutation of all charges, and the best advertisement\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt would not be the time to say that the whole coöperative venture has\r\nbeen an unqualified success; but the causes of failure in each case\r\nhave been perfectly obvious, and no fault of the system. Lack of\r\nbusiness ability has been the main trouble, and the lack of courage\r\nand unity which everywhere characterizes mankind, but is perhaps more\r\nemphasized on a coast where failure means starvation, and where the\r\ncoöperative spirit has been rendered very difficult to arouse owing to\r\nmistrust born of religious sectarianism and denominational schools.\r\nThese all militate very strongly against that unity which alone can\r\nenable labour to come to its own without productive ability.\r\n\r\nThere is one aspect for which we are particularly grateful. Politics,\r\nat any rate, has not been permitted to intrude, and the stress laid on\r\nthe need of brotherliness, forbearance, and self-development--if ever\r\nthese producers are to reap the rewards of being their own\r\ntraders--has been very marked. Only thus can they share in the balance\r\nof profit which makes the difference between plenty and poverty on\r\nthis isolated coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MILL AND THE FOX FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument for coöperation had been that life on the coast was not\r\nworth living under the credit system. A short feast and a long famine\r\nwas the local epigram. If our profits could be maintained on the\r\ncoast, and spent on the coast, then the next-to-nature life had enough\r\nto offer in character as well as in maintenance to attract a permanent\r\npopulation, especially with the furring in winter. For the actual\r\nfigures showed that good hunters made from a thousand to fifteen\r\nhundred dollars in a season, besides the salmon and cod fishery. There\r\nwas, moreover, game for food, free firewood, water, homes, and no\r\ntaxation except indirect in duties on their goods.\r\n\r\nThese same conditions prevailed on the long, narrow slice of land\r\nknown as the \"French shore\" in northern Newfoundland. There the people\r\nwere more densely settled, the hinterland was small, and many\r\ntherefore could not go furring. Moreover, the polar current, entering\r\nthe mouth of the Straits of Belle Isle, makes this section of land\r\nmore liable to summer frosts, with a far worse climate than the\r\nLabrador bays, and gardening is less remunerative. We puzzled our\r\nbrains for some way to add to our earning capacities, some coöperative\r\nproductive as well as distributive enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe poverty which I had witnessed in Canada Bay in North Newfoundland,\r\nsome sixty miles south of St. Anthony Hospital, had left me very keen\r\nto do something for that district which might really offer a solution\r\nof the problem. I had been told that there was plenty of timber to\r\njustify running a mill in the bay; but that no sawmills paid in\r\nNewfoundland. This was emphasized in St. John's by my friends who\r\nstill own the only venture out of the eleven which have operated in\r\nthat city that has been able to continue. They have succeeded by\r\nadopting modern methods and erecting a factory for making furniture,\r\nso as to supply finished articles direct to their customers. We knew\r\nthat in our case labour would be cheaper than ordinarily, for our\r\nlabour in winter had generally to go begging. It was mainly this fact\r\nwhich finally induced us to make the attempt.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ST. ANTHONY]\r\n\r\nHaving talked the matter over with the people we secured from the\r\nGovernment a special grant, as the venture, if it succeeded, would\r\nrelieve them of the necessity of having poor-relief bills. The whole\r\nexpense of the enterprise fell upon myself, for the Mission Board\r\nconsidered it outside their sphere; and already we had built St.\r\nAnthony Hospital in spite of the fact that they thought that we were\r\nundertaking more than they would be able to handle, and had\r\ndiscouraged it from the first.\r\n\r\nThe people had no money to start a mill, and the circumstances\r\nprohibited my asking aid from outside, so it was with considerable\r\nanxiety that we ordered a mill, as if it were a pound of chocolates,\r\nand arranged with two young friends to come out from England as\r\nvolunteers, except for their expenses, to help us through with the new\r\neffort. At the same time there was three hundred dollars to pay for\r\nthe necessary survey and line cutting, and supplies of food for the\r\nloggers for the winter. Houses must also be erected and furnished.\r\n\r\nIgnorance undoubtedly supplied us with the courage to begin.\r\nPersonally I knew nothing whatever of mills, having never even seen\r\none. Nor had I seen the grant of land, or selected a site for the\r\nbuilding. This was left entirely to the people themselves; and as none\r\nof them had ever seen a mill either, we all felt a bit uneasy about\r\nour capacities. I had left orders with the captain of the Coöperator\r\n(our schooner) to fetch the mill and put it where the people told him;\r\nbut when I heard that there was one piece which included the boiler\r\nwhich weighed three tons, it seemed to me that they could never handle\r\nit. We had no wharf ready to receive it and no boat capable of\r\ncarrying it. I woke many times that summer wondering if it had not\r\ngone to the bottom while they were attempting the landing. There was\r\nno communication whatever with them as we were six hundred miles\r\nfarther north on our summer cruise; and we had not the slightest\r\ncontrol over the circumstances in which we might become involved.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the season and the snow was already deep on the ground\r\nwhen eventually we were piloted to the spot selected. It was nine\r\nmiles up the bay on a well-wooded promontory of a side inlet. The\r\nwater was deep to the shore and the harbour as safe as a house. The\r\nboys from England had arrived, and a small cottage had been erected,\r\ntucked away in the trees. It was very small, and very damp, the inside\r\nof the walls being white with frost in the morning until the fire had\r\nbeen under way for some time. But it was a merry crowd, emerging from\r\nvarious little hutlets around among the trees, which greeted the\r\nStrathcona.\r\n\r\nThe big boiler, the \"bugaboo\" of my dreams all summer, lay on the\r\nbank. \"How did you get it there?\" was my first query. \"We warped the\r\nvessel close to the land, and then hove her close ashore and put skids\r\nfrom the rocks off to her. On these we slid the boiler, all hands\r\nhauling it up with our tackles.\"\r\n\r\nHaving left the few supplies which we had with us, for the Strathcona\r\nhas no hold or carrying space, we returned to the hospital, mighty\r\ngrateful for the successful opening of the venture. The survey had\r\nbeen completed and accepted by the Government, and though\r\nunfortunately it was but very poorly marked, and we have had lots of\r\ntrouble since,--as we have never been able to say exactly where our\r\nboundaries lie, nor even to find marks enough to follow over the\r\noriginal survey again,--yet it enabled us to get to work, which was\r\nall that we wanted at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe fresh problems at the hospital, and the constant demands on our\r\nenergies, made Christmas and New Year go by with our minds quite\r\nalienated from the cares of the new enterprise. But when after\r\nChristmas the dogs had safely carried us over many miles of\r\nsnow-covered wastes, and our immediate patients gave us a chance to\r\nlook farther afield, I began to wonder if we might not pay the mill a\r\nvisit. By land it was only fifty miles distant to the southward,\r\npossibly sixty if we had to go round the bays. The only difficulty\r\nabout the trip was that there were no trails, and most of the way led\r\nthrough virgin forest, where windfalls and stumps and dense\r\nundergrowth mixed with snow made the ordinary obstacle race a sprint\r\nin the open in comparison. We knew what it meant, because in our\r\neagerness to begin our dog-driving when the first snow came, we had\r\nwandered over small trees crusted with snow, fallen through, and\r\nliterally floundered about under the crust, unable to climb to the top\r\nagain. It was the nearest thing to the sensations of a man who cannot\r\nswim struggling under the surface of the water. Moreover, on a tramp\r\nwith the minister, he had gone through his snow racquets and actually\r\nlost the bows later, smashing them all up as he repeatedly fell\r\nthrough between logs and tree-trunks and \"tuckamore.\" His summons for\r\nhelp and the idea that there were still eight miles to go still\r\nhaunted me. On that occasion we had cut down some spruce boughs and\r\nimprovised some huge webbed feet for ourselves, which had saved the\r\nsituation; but whether they would have served for twenty or thirty\r\nmiles, we could not tell. Not so long before a man named Casey,\r\nbringing his komatik down the steep hill at Conche, missed his footing\r\nand fell headlong by a bush into the snow. The heavy, loaded sledge\r\nran over him and pressed him still farther into the bank. Struggling\r\nonly made him sink the deeper, and an hour later the poor fellow was\r\ndiscovered smothered to death.\r\n\r\nNo one knew the way. We could not hear of a single man who had ever\r\ngone across in winter, though some said that an old fellow who had\r\nlived farther south had once carried the mails that way. At length we\r\ncould stand it no longer, and arranging with four men and two extra\r\nteams, we started off. We hoped to reach the mill in two days, but at\r\nthe end of that time we were still trying to push through the tangle\r\nof these close-grown forests. To steer by compass sounded easy, but\r\nthe wretched instrument seemed persistently to point to precipitous\r\ncliffs or impenetrable thickets. There were no barren hilltops after\r\nthe first twenty miles. Occasionally we would stop, climb a tree, and\r\ntry to get a view. But climbing a conifer whose boughs are heavily\r\nladen with ice and snow is no joke, and gave very meagre returns. At\r\nlast, however, we struck a high divide, and from an island in the\r\ncentre of a lake, occupied only by two lone fir trees, we got a view\r\nboth ways, showing the Cloudy Hills which towered over the south side\r\nof the bay in which the mill stood.\r\n\r\nA very high, densely wooded hill lay, however, directly in our path;\r\nand which way to get round it best none of us knew. We \"tossed up\"\r\nand went to the eastward--the wrong side, of course. We soon struck a\r\nriver, and at once surmised that if we followed it, it must bring us\r\nto the head of the bay, which meant only three miles of salt water ice\r\nto cover. Alas, the stream proved very torrential. It leaped here and\r\nthere over so many rapid falls that great canyons were left in the\r\nice, and instead of being able to dash along as when first we struck\r\nit, we had painfully to pick our way between heavy ice-blocks, which\r\nsorely tangled up our traces, and our dogs ran great danger of being\r\ninjured. Nor could we leave the river, for the banks were precipitous\r\nand utterly impassable with undergrowth. At length when we came to a\r\ngorge where the boiling torrent was not even frozen, and as prospects\r\nof being washed under the ice became only too vivid, we were forced to\r\ncut our way out on the sloping sides. The task was great fun, but an\r\nexceedingly slow process.\r\n\r\nIt was altogether an exciting and delightful trip. Now we have a good\r\ntrail cut and blazed, which after some years of experience we have\r\ngradually straightened out, with two tilts by the roadside when the\r\nweather makes camping imperative, or when delay is caused by having\r\nhelpless patients to haul, till now it is only a \"joy-ride\" to go\r\nthrough that beautiful country \"on dogs.\" There is always a challenge,\r\nhowever, left in that trail--just enough to lend tang to the toil of\r\nit. Once, having missed the way in a blizzard, we had to camp on the\r\nsnow with the thermometer standing at twenty below zero. The problem\r\nwas all the more interesting as we struck only \"taunt\" timberwoods\r\nwith no undergrowth to halt the wind. On another occasion we attempted\r\nto cross Hare Bay, and one of the dogs fell through the ice. There was\r\na biting wind blowing, and it was ten degrees below zero. When we\r\nwere a mile off the land I got off the sledge to try the ice edge,\r\nwhen suddenly it gave way, and in I fell. It did not take me long to\r\nget out--the best advice being to \"keep cool.\" I had as hard a mile's\r\nrunning as ever I experienced, for my clothing was fast becoming like\r\nthe armour of an ancient knight; and though in my youth I had been\r\naccustomed to break the ice in the morning to bathe, I had never run\r\nin a coat of mail.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget dragging ourselves in among those big trees with\r\nour axes, and tumbling to sleep in a grave in the snow, in spite of\r\nthe elements. In this hole in a sleeping-bag, protected by the light\r\ndrift which blew in, one rested as comfortably as in a more\r\nconventional type of feather bed. Nor, when I think of De Quincey's\r\nidea of supreme happiness before the glowing logs, can I forget that\r\ngorgeous blaze which the watch kept up by felling trees full length\r\ninto the fire, so that our Yule logs were twenty feet long, and the\r\nruddy glow and crackling warmth went smashing through the hurtling\r\nsnowdrift. True, it was cold taking off our dripping clothing, which\r\nas it froze on us made progress as difficult as if we were encased in\r\narmour. But dancing up and down before a huge fire in the crisp open\r\nair under God's blue sky gave as pleasing a reaction as doing the same\r\nthing in the dusty, germ-laden atmosphere of a ballroom in the small\r\nhours of the night, when one would better be in bed, if the joys of\r\nefficiency and accomplishment are the durable pleasure of life.\r\n\r\nIt was a real picnic which we had at the mill. Our visit was as\r\nwelcome as it was unexpected, and we celebrated it by the whole day\r\noff, when all hands went \"rabbiting.\" When at the end, hot and tired,\r\nwe gathered round a huge log fire in the woods and discussed boiling\r\ncocoa and pork buns, we all agreed that it had been a day worth\r\nliving for.\r\n\r\nLogging had progressed favourably. Logs were close at hand; and the\r\nwhole enterprise spelled cash coming in that the people had never\r\nearned before. The time had also arrived to prepare the machinery for\r\ncutting the timber; boxes were being unpacked, and weird iron \"parts\"\r\nrevealed to us, that had all the interest of a Chinese puzzle, with\r\nthe added pleasure of knowing that they stood for much if we solved\r\nthe problems rightly.\r\n\r\nWhen next we saw the mill it was spring, and the puffing smoke and\r\nwhite heaps of lumber that graced the point and met our vision as we\r\nrounded Breakheart Point will not soon be forgotten. Only one trouble\r\nhad proved insurmountable. The log-hauler would not deliver the goods\r\nto the rotary saw. Later, with the knowledge that the whole apparatus\r\nwas upside down, it did not seem so surprising after all. One accident\r\nalso marred the year's record. While a party of children had been\r\ncrossing the ice in the harbour to school, a treacherous rapid had\r\ncaused it to give way and leave a number of them in the water. One of\r\nmy English volunteers, being a first-class athlete, had by swimming\r\nsaved five lives, but two had been lost, and the young fellow himself\r\nso badly chilled that it had taken the hot body of one of the fathers\r\nof the rescued children, wrapped up in bed with him in lieu of a\r\nhot-water bottle, to restore his circulation.\r\n\r\nThe second fall was our hardest period. The bills for our lumber sold\r\nhad not been paid in time for us to purchase the absolutely essential\r\nstock of food for the winter; and if we could not get a store of food,\r\nwe knew that our men could not go logging. It was food, not cash,\r\nwhich they needed in the months when their own slender stock of\r\nprovisions gave out, and when all communication was cut off by the\r\nfrozen sea.\r\n\r\nFor a venture which seemed to us problematical in its outcome, we did\r\nnot dare to borrow money or to induce friends to invest; and of course\r\nMission funds were not available. For the day has not yet arrived when\r\nall those who seek by their gifts to hasten the coming of the Kingdom\r\nof God on earth recognize that to give the opportunity to men to\r\nprovide decently for their families and homes is as effective work for\r\nthe Master, whose first attribute was love, as patching up the\r\nunfortunate victims of semi-starvation. The inculcation of the\r\nparticular intellectual conception which the donor may hold of\r\nreligion, or as to how, after death, the soul can get into heaven, is,\r\nas the result of the Church teaching, still considered far the most\r\nimportant line of effort. The emphasis on hospitals is second, partly\r\nat least because, so it has seemed to me as a doctor of medicine, the\r\nmore obvious personal benefit thereby conferred renders the recipients\r\nmore impressionable to the views considered desirable to promulgate.\r\nYet only to-day, as I came home from our busy operating-room, I felt\r\nhow little real gain the additional time on earth often is either to\r\nthe world outside or even to the poor sufferers themselves. In order\r\nto have one's early teachings on these matters profoundly shaken, one\r\nhas only to work as a surgeon in a country where tuberculosis,\r\nberi-beri, and other preventable diseases, and especially the chronic\r\nmalnutrition of poverty fills your clinic with suffering children, who\r\nat least are victims and not responsible spiritually for their\r\n\"punishment.\" Of course, the magnitude of service to the world of\r\nevery act of unselfishness, and much more of whole lives of devotion,\r\nsuch as that of Miss Sullivan, the teacher of Miss Helen Keller, can\r\nnever be rightly estimated by any purely material conception of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLove is dangerously near to sentimentality when we actually prefer\r\nremedial to prophylactic charity--and I personally feel that it is\r\nfalse economy even from the point of view of mission funds. The\r\nindustrial mission, the educational mission, and the orphanage work at\r\nleast rank with and should go hand in hand with hospitals in any true\r\ninterpretation of a gospel of love.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent years the nearest attempt to finance such commonly\r\ncalled \"side issues of the work\" has been with us through the medium\r\nof a discretionary fund. Into this are put sums of money specially\r\ngiven by personal friends, who are content to leave the allocation of\r\ntheir expenditure in the hands of the worker on the actual field. This\r\nfund is, of course, paid out in the same way as other mission funds,\r\nand is as strictly supervised by the auditors. While it leaves\r\npossibly more responsibility than some of us are worthy of, it enables\r\nindividuality to play that part in mission business which every one\r\nrecognizes to be all-important in the ordinary business of the world.\r\nNo money, however, from this fund has ever gone into the mill or in\r\nassisting the coöperative stores.\r\n\r\nSorry as one feels to confess it, I have seen money wasted and lost\r\nthrough red tape in the mission business. And after all is not mission\r\nbusiness part of the world's business, and must not the measure of\r\nsuccess depend largely on the same factors in the one case as in the\r\nother? Has one man more than another the right to be called\r\n\"missionary,\" for of what use is any man in the world if he has no\r\nmission in it? Christ's life is one long emphasis on the point that in\r\nthe last analysis, when something has to be done, it is the individual\r\nwho has to do it. It is, we believe, a fact of paramount importance\r\nfor efficiency and economy; and the loyalty of God in committing such\r\ntrust to us, when He presumably knows exactly how unworthy we are of\r\nit, is the explanation of life's enigma.\r\n\r\nWhen at last our food and freight were purchased for the loggers for\r\nthe winter and landed by the mail steamer nine miles from the mill,\r\nthe whole bay was frozen and five miles of ice already over six inches\r\nthick. The hull of the Strathcona was three eighths of an inch soft\r\nsteel; but there was no other way to transport the goods but on her,\r\nexcepting by sledges--a very painful and impracticable method.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that as we could not possibly butt through the ice, we\r\nmust butt over it. The whole company of some thirty men helped us to\r\nmove everything, including chains and anchors, to the after end of the\r\nship, and to pile up the barrels of pork, flour, sugar, molasses,\r\netc., together with boats and all heavy weights, so that her fore foot\r\ncame above the water level and she looked as if she were sinking by\r\nthe stern. We then proceeded to crash into the ice. Up onto it we ran,\r\nand then broke through, doing no damage whatever to her hull. The only\r\ntrouble was that sometimes she would get caught fast in the trough,\r\nand it was exceedingly hard to back her astern for a second drive. To\r\ncounteract this all hands stood on one rail, each carrying a weight,\r\nand then rushed over to the other side, backward and forward at the\r\nword of command, thus causing the steamer to roll. It was a very slow\r\nprocess, but we got there, though in true Biblical fashion, literally\r\n\"reeling to and fro like drunken men.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the mill was in its cradle, we in the Strathcona were cruising\r\nthe northern Labrador waters. We witnessed that year, off the mighty\r\nKaumajets, the most remarkable storm of lightning that I have ever\r\nseen in those parts. Inky masses hid the hoary heads of those\r\ntremendous cliffs. Away to the northwest, over the high land called\r\nSaeglek, a lurid light just marked the sharp outline of the mills.\r\nAhead, where we were trying to make the entrance to Hebron Bay, an\r\napparently impenetrable wall persisted. Seaward night had already\r\nobscured the horizon; but the moon, hidden behind the curtain of the\r\nstorm, now and again fitfully illuminated some icebergs lazily heaving\r\non the ocean swell. Almost every second a vivid flash, now on one\r\nside, now on the other, would show us a glimpse of the land looming\r\ndarkly ahead. The powers of darkness seemed at play; while the sea,\r\nthe ice, the craggy cliffs, and the flashing heavens were advertising\r\nman's puny power.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident took place in one isolated harbour. A patient came\r\non board for medicine, and after examining him I went below to make it\r\nup. When I came on deck again I gave the medicine to one I took to be\r\nmy man, and then sent him ashore to get the twenty-five cent fee for\r\nthe Mission which he had forgotten. No sooner had he gone than another\r\nman came and asked if his medicine was ready. I had to explain to him\r\nthat the man just climbing over the rail had it. The odd thing was\r\nthat the latter, having paid for it, positively refused to give it up.\r\nTrue, he had not said that he was ill, but the medicine looked good\r\n(Heaven save the mark!) and he \"guessed that it would suit his\r\ncomplaint all right.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mill we found that quite a large part of the timberland was\r\nover limestone, while near our first dam there was some very white\r\nmarble. We fully intended to erect a kiln, using our refuse for fuel,\r\nfor the land is loaded with humic acid, and only plants like\r\nblueberries, conifers, and a very limited flora flourish on it. Some\r\nfriends in England, however, hearing of marble in the bay, which it\r\nwas later discovered formed an entire mountain, commenced a marble\r\nmine near the entrance. The material there is said to be excellent for\r\nstatuary. Even this small discovery of natural resources encouraged\r\nus. For having neither road, telegraph, nor mail service to the mill,\r\nwe hoped that the development of these things might help in our own\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nFor ten years the little mill has run, giving work to the locality,\r\nbetter houses, a new church and school, and indeed created a new\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble with this North country's own peculiar winter work,\r\nfur-hunting, is that its very nature limits its supply. In my early\r\ndays in the country, fur in Labrador was very cheap. Seldom did even a\r\nsilver fox fetch a hundred dollars. Beaver, lynx, wolverine, wolves,\r\nbears, and other skins were priced proportionately. Still, some men\r\nlived very well out of furring. We came to the conclusion that the\r\nonly way to improve conditions in this line was to breed some of the\r\nanimals in captivity. We did not then know of any enterprise of that\r\nkind, but I remembered in the zoölogical gardens at Washington seeing\r\na healthy batch of young fox pups born in captivity.\r\n\r\nLife is short. Things have to be crowded into it. So we started that\r\nyear an experimental fox farm at St. Anthony. A few uprights from the\r\nwoods and some rolls of wire are a fox farm. We put it close by the\r\nhospital, thinking that it would be less trouble. The idea, we rejoice\r\nto know, was perfectly right; but we had neither time, study, nor\r\nexperience to teach us how to manage the animals. Very soon we had a\r\ndozen couples, red, white, patch, and one silver pair. Some of the\r\nyoung fox pups were very tame, for I find an old record written by a\r\nprofessor of Harvard University, while he was on board the Strathcona\r\non one trip when we were bringing some of the little creatures to St.\r\nAnthony. He describes the state of affairs as follows: \"Dr. Grenfell\r\nat one time had fifteen little foxes aboard which he was carrying to\r\nSt. Anthony to start a fox farm there. Some of these little animals\r\nhad been brought aboard in blubber casks, and their coats were very\r\nsticky. After a few days they were very tame and played with the dogs;\r\nwere all over the deck, fell down the companionway, were always having\r\ntheir tails and feet stepped on, and yelping for pain, when not\r\nyelling for food. The long-suffering seaman who took care of them\r\nsaid, 'I been cleaned out that fox box. It do be shockin'. I been in a\r\ncourageous turmoil my time, but dis be the head smell ever I\r\nwitnessed.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the farm was erected, every schooner entering the harbour was\r\ninterested in it, and a deep-cut pathway soon developed as the crews\r\nwent up to see the animals. The reds and one patch were very tame, and\r\nalways came out to greet us. One of the reds loved nothing better than\r\nto be caught and hugged, and squealed with delight like a child when\r\nyou took notice of it. The whites, and still more the silvers, were\r\nalways very shy; and though we never reared a single pup, there were\r\nsome born and destroyed by the old ones.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed we decided to close up the little farm,\r\nparticularly after a certain kind of sickness which resembled\r\nstrychnine poisoning had attacked and destroyed three of the animals\r\nwhich were especial pets. We then converted the farm into a garden\r\nwith a glass house for our seedling vegetables.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the industry had been developed by a Mr. Beetz in Quebec\r\nLabrador with very marked economic success; and in Prince Edward\r\nIsland with such tremendous profit that it soon became the most\r\nimportant industry in the Province. Enormous prices were paid for\r\nstock. I remembered a schooner in the days of our farm (1907) bringing\r\nme in four live young silvers, and asking two hundred dollars for the\r\nlot. We had enough animals and refused to buy them. In 1914 one of our\r\ndistant neighbours, who had caught a live slut in pup, sold her with\r\nher little brood for ten thousand dollars. We at once started an\r\nagitation to encourage the industry locally, and the Government passed\r\nregulations that only foxes bred in the Colony could be exported\r\nalive. The last wild one sold was for twenty-five dollars to a buyer,\r\nand resold for something like a thousand dollars by him. A large\r\nnumber of farms grew up and met with more or less success, one big one\r\nespecially in Labrador, which is still running. We saw there this\r\npresent year some delightful little broods, also some mink and marten\r\n(sables), the prettiest little animals to watch possible. For some\r\nreason the success of this farm so far has not been what was hoped for\r\nit. Indeed, even in Prince Edward Island the furor has somewhat died\r\ndown owing to the war; though at the close of the war it is\r\nanticipated that the industry will go on steadily and profitably. Are\r\nnot sheep, angora goats, oxen, and other animals just the result of\r\nsimilar efforts? If fox-farming some day should actually supersede the\r\nuse of the present sharp-toothed leg trap, no small gain would have\r\nbeen effected. A fox now trapped in those horrible teeth remains\r\nimprisoned generally till he perishes of cold, exhaustion, or fear.\r\nThough the fur trapper as a rule is a most gentle creature, the\r\n\"quality of mercy is not strained\" in furring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN'S HOME\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's that schooner bound South at this time of year for?\" I asked\r\nthe skipper of a fishing vessel who had come aboard for treatment the\r\nsecond summer I was on the coast.\r\n\r\n\"I guess, Doctor, that that's the Yankee what's been down North for a\r\nload of Huskeymaws. What do they want with them when they gets them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll put them in a cage and show them at ten cents a head. They're\r\ntaking them to the World's Fair in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeople of every sort crowded to see the popular Eskimo Encampment on\r\nthe Midway. The most taking attraction among the groups displayed was\r\na little boy, son of a Northern Chieftain, Kaiachououk by name; and\r\nmany a nickel was thrown into the ring that little Prince Pomiuk might\r\nshow his dexterity with the thirty-foot lash of his dog whip.\r\n\r\nOne man alone of all who came to stare at the little people from\r\nfar-off Labrador took a real interest in the child. It was the Rev.\r\nC.C. Carpenter, who had spent many years of his life as a clergyman on\r\nthe Labrador coast. But one day Mr. Carpenter missed his little\r\nfriend. Pomiuk was found on a bed of sickness in his dark hut. An\r\ninjury to his thigh had led to the onset of an insidious hip disease.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition closed soon after, and the Eskimos went north. But\r\nPomiuk was not forgotten, and Mr. Carpenter sent him letter after\r\nletter, though he never received an answer. The first year the band\r\nof Eskimos reached as far north as Ramah, but Pomiuk's increasing\r\nsufferings made it impossible for them to take him farther that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in June, 1895, we again steamed out through the Narrows of\r\nSt. John's Harbour, determined to push as far north as the farthest\r\nwhite family. A dark foggy night in August found us at the entrance of\r\nthat marvellous gorge called Nakvak. We pushed our way cautiously in\r\nsome twenty miles from the entrance. Suddenly the watch sang out,\r\n\"Light on the starboard bow!\" and the sound of our steamer whistle\r\nechoed and reëchoed in endless cadences between those mighty cliffs.\r\nThree rifle shots answered us, soon a boat bumped our side, and a\r\nhearty Englishman sprang over the rail.\r\n\r\nIt was George Ford, factor of the Hudson Bay Company at that post.\r\nDuring the evening's talk he told me of a group of Eskimos still\r\nfarther up the fjord having with them a dying boy. Next day I had my\r\nfirst glimpse of little Prince Pomiuk. We found him naked and haggard,\r\nlying on the rocks beside the tiny \"tubik.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos were only too glad to be rid of the responsibility of the\r\nsick lad, and, furthermore, he was \"no good fishing.\" So the next day\r\nsaw us steaming south again, carrying with us the boy and his one\r\ntreasured possession--a letter from a clergyman at Andover,\r\nMassachusetts. It contained a photograph, and when I showed it to\r\nPomiuk he said, \"Me even love him.\"\r\n\r\nA letter was sent to the address given, and some weeks later came back\r\nan answer. \"Keep him,\" it said. \"He must never know cold and\r\nloneliness again. I write for a certain magazine, and the children in\r\n'The Corner' will become his guardians.\" Thus the \"Corner Cot\" was\r\nfounded, and occupied by the little Eskimo Prince for the brief\r\nremainder of his life.\r\n\r\nOn my return the following summer the child's joyful laughter greeted\r\nme as he said, \"Me Gabriel Pomiuk now.\" A good Moravian Brother had\r\ncome along during the winter and christened the child by the name of\r\nthe angel of comfort.\r\n\r\nIn a sheltered corner of a little graveyard on the Labrador coast\r\nrests the tiny body of this true prince. When he died the doctor in\r\ncharge of the hospital wrote me that the building seemed desolate\r\nwithout his smiling, happy face and unselfish presence. The night that\r\nhe was buried the mysterious aurora lit up the vault of heaven. The\r\nInnuits, children of the Northland, call it \"the spirits of the dead\r\nat play.\" But it seemed to us a shining symbol of the joy in the City\r\nof the King that another young soldier had won his way home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church is undoubtedly correct in stating that the\r\nfirst seven years of his life makes the child. Missions have always\r\nemphasized the importance of the children from a purely propaganda\r\npoint of view. But our Children's Home was not begun for any such\r\nreason. Like Topsy, \"it just grow'd.\" I had been summoned to a lonely\r\nheadland, fifty miles from our hospital at Indian Harbour, to see a\r\nvery sick family. Among the spruce trees in a small hut lived a Scotch\r\nsalmon fisher, his wife and five little children. When we anchored off\r\nthe promontory we were surprised to receive no signs of welcome. When\r\nwe landed and entered the house we found the mother dead on the bed\r\nand the father lying on the floor dying. Next morning we improvised\r\ntwo coffins, contributed from the wardrobes of all hands enough black\r\nmaterial for a \"seemly\" funeral, and later, steaming up the bay to a\r\nsandy stretch of land, buried the two parents with all the ceremonies\r\nof the Church--and found ourselves left with five little mortals in\r\nblack sitting on the grave mound. We thought that we had done all that\r\ncould be expected of a doctor, but we now found the difference. It\r\nlooked as if God expected more. An uncle volunteered to assume one\r\nlittle boy and we sailed away with the remainder of the children.\r\nHaving no place to keep them, we wrote to a friendly newspaper in New\r\nEngland and advertised for foster parents. One person responded. A\r\nyoung farmer's wife wrote: \"I am just married to a farmer in the\r\ncountry, and miss the chance to teach children in Sunday-School, or\r\neven to get to church, it is so far away. I think that I can feed two\r\nchildren for the Lord's sake. If you will send them along, I will see\r\nthat they do not want for anything.\" We shipped two, and began what\r\ndeveloped into our Children's Home with the balance of the stock.\r\n\r\nWe had everything to learn in the rearing of children, having had only\r\nthe hygienic side of their development to attend to previously. One of\r\nthe two which we kept turned out very well, becoming a fully trained\r\nnurse. The other failed. Both of those who went to New England did\r\nwell, the superior discipline of their foster mother being no doubt\r\nresponsible. The following fall I made a special journey to see the\r\nlatter. It was a small farm on which they lived, and a little baby had\r\njust arrived. Only high ideals could have persuaded the woman to\r\naccept the added responsibility. The children were as bright and jolly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nAmong the other functions which have fallen to my lot to perform is\r\nthe ungrateful task of unpaid magistrate, or justice of the peace. In\r\nthis capacity a little later I was called on to try a mother, who in a\r\nLabrador village had become a widow and later married a man with six\r\nchildren who refused to accept her three-year-old little girl. When I\r\nhappened along, the baby was living alone in the mother's old shack, a\r\nmud-walled hut, and she or the neighbours went in and tended it as\r\nthey could. None of the few neighbours wanted permanently to assume\r\nthe added expense of the child, so dared not accept it temporarily. It\r\nwas sitting happily on the floor playing with a broken saucer when I\r\ncame in. It showed no fear of a stranger; indeed, it made most\r\nfriendly overtures. I had no right to send the new husband to jail. I\r\ncould not fine him, for he had no money. There was no jail in\r\nLabrador, anyhow. My special constable was a very stout fisherman, a\r\nfamily man, who proposed to nurse the child till I could get it to\r\nsome place where it could be properly looked after. When we steamed\r\naway, we had the baby lashed into a swing cot. It became very rough,\r\nand the baby, of course, crawled out and was found in the scuppers. It\r\ndid everything that it ought not to do, but which we knew that it\r\nwould. But we got it to the hospital at last and the nurse received it\r\nright to her heart.\r\n\r\nIn various ways my family grew at an alarming rate, once the general\r\nprinciple was established. On my early summer voyage to the east coast\r\nof Labrador I found at Indian Harbour Hospital a little girl of four.\r\nIn the absence of her father, who was hunting, and while her mother\r\nlay sick in bed, she had crawled out of the house and when found in\r\nthe snow had both legs badly frozen. They became gangrenous halfway to\r\nthe knee, and her father had been obliged to chop them both off. An\r\noperation gave her good stumps; but what use was she in Labrador with\r\nno legs? So she joined our family, and we gave her such good new limbs\r\nthat when I brought her into Government House at Halifax, where one\r\nof our nurses had taken her to school temporarily, and she ran into\r\nthe room with two other little girls, the Governor could scarcely tell\r\nwhich was our little cripple Kirkina.\r\n\r\nThe following fall as we left for the South our good friend, the chief\r\nfactor of the Hudson Bay Company, told me that on an island in the\r\nlarge inlet known to us as Eskimo Bay a native family, both hungry and\r\nnaked, were living literally under the open sky. We promised to try\r\nand find them and help them with some warm clothing.\r\n\r\nHaving steamed round the island and seen no signs of life, we were on\r\nthe point of leaving when a tiny smoke column betrayed the presence of\r\nhuman life--and with my family-man mate we landed as a search party.\r\nAgainst the face of a sheer rock a single sheet of light cotton duck\r\ncovered the abode of a woman with a nursing baby. They were the only\r\npersons at home. The three boys and a father comprised the remainder\r\nof the family. We soon found the two small boys. They were practically\r\nstark naked, but fat as curlews, being full of wild berries with which\r\ntheir bodies were stained bright blues and reds. They were a jolly\r\nlittle couple, as unconcerned about their environment as Robinson\r\nCrusoe after five years on his island. Soon the father came home. I\r\ncan see him still--the vacant brown face of a very feeble-minded\r\nhalf-breed, ragged and tattered and almost bootless. He was carrying\r\nan aged single-barrelled boy's gun in one hand and a belated sea-gull\r\nin the other, which bird was destined for the entire evening meal of\r\nthe family. A half-wild-looking hobbledehoy boy of fifteen years also\r\njoined the group.\r\n\r\nIt was just beginning to snow, a wet sleet. Eight months of winter\r\nlay ahead. Yet not one of the family seemed to think a whit about that\r\nwhich was vivid enough to the minds of the mate and myself. We sat\r\ndown for a regular pow-wow beside the fire sputtering in the open\r\nroom, from which thick smoke crept up the face of the rock, and hung\r\nover us in a material but symbolic cloud. It was naturally cold. The\r\nman began with a plea for some \"clodin.\" We began with a plea for some\r\nchildren. How many would he swap for a start in clothing and \"tings\r\nfor his winter\"? He picked out and gave us Jimmie. The soft-hearted\r\nmate, on whose cheeks the tears were literally standing, grabbed\r\nJimmie--as the latter did his share of the gull. But we were not\r\nsatisfied. We had to have Willie. It was only when a breaking of\r\ndiplomatic relations altogether was threatened that Willie was\r\nsacrificed on the altar of \"tings.\" I forget the price, but I think\r\nthat we threw in an axe, which was one of the trifles which the father\r\nlacked--and in this of all countries! The word was no sooner spoken\r\nthan our shellback again excelled himself. He pounced on Willie like a\r\nhawk on its prey, and before the treaty was really concluded he was\r\noff to our dory with a naked boy kicking violently in the vice of each\r\nof his powerful arms. The grasping strength of our men, reared from\r\nchildhood to haul heavy strains and ponderous anchors, is phenomenal.\r\n\r\nWhatever sins Labrador has been guilty of, Malthusianism is not in the\r\ncategory. Nowhere are there larger families. Those of Quebec Labrador,\r\nwhich is better known, are of almost world-wide fame. God is, to\r\nLabrador thinking, the Giver of all children. Man's responsibility is\r\nmerely to do the best he can to find food and clothing for them. A man\r\ncan accomplish only so much. If these \"gifts of God\" suffer and are a\r\nburden to others that is kismet. It is the animal philosophy and\r\nmakes women's lives on this coast terribly hard. The opportunity for\r\nservice along child-welfare lines is therefore not surprising from\r\nthis angle also.\r\n\r\nOne day, passing a group of islands, we anchored in a bight known as\r\nRogues' Roost. It so happened that a man who many years before had\r\nshot off his right arm, and had followed up his incapacity with a\r\nlarge family of dependants, had just died. Life cannot be expected to\r\nlast long in Labrador under those conditions. There were four\r\nchildren, one being a big boy who could help out. The rest were\r\noffered as a contribution to the Mission. A splendid Newfoundland\r\nfisherman and his wife had a summer fishing station here, and with\r\nthat generous open-heartedness which is characteristic of our\r\nseafarers, they were only too anxious to help. \"Of course, she would\r\nmake clothing while I was North\"--out of such odd garments as a\r\ngeneral collection produced. \"She wouldn't think of letting them wear\r\nit till I came along South, not she.\" She would \"put them in the tub\r\nas soon as she heard our whistle.\" When after the long summer's work\r\nwe landed and went up to her little house, three shining, red, naked\r\nchildren were drying before a large stove, in which the last vestige\r\nof connection with their past was contributing its quota of calories\r\ntoward the send-off. A few minutes later we were off to the ship with\r\nas sweet a batch of jolly, black-haired, dark-eyed kiddies as one\r\ncould wish for. Our good friend could not keep back the tears as she\r\nkissed them good-bye on deck. The boy has already put in three years\r\non the Western Front. The girls have both been educated, the elder\r\nhaving had two years finishing at the Pratt Institute in New York.\r\n\r\nA grimy note saying, \"Please call in to Bird Island as you pass and\r\nsee the sick,\" brought me our next donation. \"There be something wrong\r\nwith Mrs. B's twins, Doctor,\" greeted me on landing. \"Seems as if they\r\nwas like kittens, and couldn't see yet a wink.\" It was only too true.\r\nThe little twin girls were born blind in both eyes. What could they do\r\nin Labrador? Two more for our family without any question. After\r\nleaving our Orphanage, these two went through the beautiful school for\r\nthe blind at Halifax, and are now able to make their own living in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSo the roll swelled. Some came because they were orphans; some because\r\nthey were not. Thus, poor Sammy. The home from which he came was past\r\ndescription. From the outside it looked like a tumble-down shed.\r\nInside there appeared to be but one room, which measured six by twelve\r\nfeet, and a small lean-to. The family consisted of father and mother\r\nand three children. The eldest boy was about twelve, then came Sam,\r\nand lastly a wee girl of five, with pretty curly fair hair, but very\r\nthin and delicate-looking. She seemed to be half-starved and\r\nthoroughly neglected. The father was a ne'er-do-well and the mother an\r\nimbecile who has since died of tuberculosis. The filth inside was\r\nawful. The house was built of logs, and the spaces in between them\r\nwere partly filled in with old rags and moss. The roof leaked. The\r\nroom seemed to be alive with vermin, as were also the whole family.\r\nThe two boys were simply clothed in a pair of men's trousers apiece\r\nand a dilapidated pair of boots between them. The trousers they found\r\nvery hard to keep on and had to give them frequent hoists up. They\r\nwere both practically destitute of underclothing. To hide all\r\ndeficiencies, they each wore a woman's long jacket of the oldest style\r\npossible and green with age, which reached down to their heels. Round\r\ntheir waists they each wore a skin strap. They were stripped of their\r\nrags, and made to scrub themselves in the stream and then indoors\r\nbefore putting on their new clean clothes. Sammy and the little sister\r\njoined the family.\r\n\r\nOne of our boys is from Cape Chidley itself; others come from as far\r\nsouth and west as Bay of Islands in South Newfoundland. So many\r\nerroneous opinions seem to persist regarding the difference between\r\nNewfoundland and Labrador that I am constantly asked: \"But why do you\r\nhave a Children's Home in Newfoundland? Can't the Newfoundlanders look\r\nout for themselves and their dependent children?\" As I have tried to\r\nmake clear in a previous chapter North and South Newfoundland should\r\nbe sharply differentiated as to wealth, education, climate, and\r\nopportunity. Though for purposes of efficiency and economy the actual\r\nbuilding of the Home is situated in the north end of the northern\r\npeninsula of Newfoundland, the children who make up the family are\r\ndrawn almost entirely from the Labrador side of the Straits; unless,\r\nas is often the case, the poverty and destitution of a so-called\r\nNewfoundland family on the south side of Belle Isle makes it\r\nimpossible to leave children under such conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that something had to be built to accommodate the\r\ngalaxy; and some one secured who understood the problem of running the\r\nHome. She--how often it is \"she\"--was found in England, a volunteer by\r\nthe name of Miss Eleanor Storr. She was a true Christian lady and a\r\ntrained worker as well. The building during the years grew with the\r\nfamily, so that it is really a wonder of odds and patches. The\r\ngenerosity of one of our volunteers, Mr. Francis Sayre, the son-in-law\r\nof President Wilson, doubled its capacity. But buildings that are made\r\nof green wood, and grow like Topsy, are apt to end like\r\nTopsy--turvy. Now we are straining every nerve to obtain a suitable\r\naccommodation for the children. We sorely need a brick building,\r\neconomically laid out and easily kept warm, with separate wings for\r\ngirls and boys and a crêche for babies. Miss Storr was obliged to\r\nleave us, and now for over six years a splendid and unselfish English\r\nlady, Miss Katie Spalding, has been helping to solve this most\r\nimportant of all problems--the preparation of the next generation to\r\nmake their land and the world a more fit place in which to live. Miss\r\nSpalding's contribution to this country has lain not only in her\r\ninfluence on the children and her unceasing care of them, but she has\r\ngiven her counsel and assistance in other problems of the Mission,\r\nwhere also her judgment, experience, and wisdom have proven\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: INSIDE THE ORPHANAGE]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another side of the orphanage problem. We have been\r\nobliged, due to the lack of any boarding-school, to accept bright\r\nchildren from isolated homes so as to give them a chance in life. It\r\nhas been the truest of love messages to several. The children always\r\nrepay, whether the parents pay anything or not; and as so much of the\r\ncare of them is volunteer, and friends have assumed the expenses of a\r\nnumber of the children, the budget has never been unduly heavy. They\r\ndo all their own work, and thanks to the inestimably valuable help of\r\nthe Needlework Guild of America through its Labrador branch, the\r\nclothing item has been made possible. In summer we use neither boots\r\nnor stockings for the children unless absolutely necessary. Our\r\nharbour people still look on that practice askance; but ours are the\r\nhealthiest lot of children on the coast, and their brown bare legs and\r\ntough, well-shaped feet are a great asset to their resistance to\r\ntuberculosis, their arch-enemy, and no small addition to the\r\nattraction of their merry faces and hatless heads.\r\n\r\nEven though Gabriel, Prince Pomiuk, never lived within its walls, the\r\nreal beginning of the idea of our Children's Home was due to him; and\r\none feels sure that his spirit loves to visit the other little ones\r\nwho claim this lonely coast as their homeland also.\r\n\r\nThe one test for surgery which we allow in these days is its \"end\r\nresults.\" Patients must not be advertised as cured till they have\r\nsurvived the treatment many years. Surely that is man's as well as\r\nGod's test. Certainly it is the gauge of the outlay in child life.\r\nWhat is the good of it all? Does it pay? In the gift of increasing joy\r\nto us, in its obvious humanity and in its continuous inspiration, it\r\ncertainly does make the work of life here in every branch the better.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problem of inducing the peace of God and the\r\nKingdom of God into our \"parish\" is most likely to be solved by wise\r\nand persevering work among the children. For in them lies the hope of\r\nthe future of this country, and their true education and upbringing to\r\nfit them for wise citizenship have been cruelly neglected in this\r\n\"outpost of Empire.\"\r\n\r\nAnother menace to the future welfare of the coast has been the lack of\r\ncareful instruction and suitable opportunities for the development,\r\nphysical, mental, and spiritual, of its girls. Without an educated and\r\nenlightened womanhood, no country, no matter how favored by material\r\nprosperity, can hope to take its place as a factor in the progress of\r\nthe world. In our orphanage and educational work we have tried to keep\r\nthese two ideas constantly before us, and to offer incentives to and\r\nopportunities for useful life-work in whatever branch, from the\r\nhumblest to the highest, a child showed aptitude.\r\n\r\nThrough the vision, ability, and devotion of Miss Storr, Miss\r\nSpalding, and their helpers, in training the characters as well as the\r\nbodies of the children at the Home, and by the generous support of\r\nfriends of children elsewhere, we have been able to turn out each year\r\nfrom its walls young men and women better fitted to cope with the\r\ndifficult problems of this environment, and to offer to its service\r\nthat best of all gifts--useful and consecrated personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery child should be washed. Every child should be educated. The only\r\nquestion is how to get there. The \"why's\" of life interest chiefly the\r\nacademic mind. The \"how's\" interest every one. It is a pleasure\r\nsometimes to be out in dirty weather on a lee shore; it permits you to\r\ndevote all your energies to accomplishing something. When secretary\r\nfor our hospital rowing club on the Thames, a fine cup was given for\r\ncompetition by Sir Frederick Treves on terms symbolic of his attitude\r\nto life. The race was to be in ordinary punts with a coxswain \"in\r\norder that every ounce of energy should be devoted to the progress of\r\nthe boat.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the whole trouble with the Newfoundland Labrador. All moneys\r\ngranted for education are handed to the churches for sectarian\r\nschools. It is almost writing ourselves down as still living in the\r\nMiddle Ages, when the Clergy had a monopoly of polite learning. In\r\nmore densely populated countries this division of grants need not be\r\nso disastrous. Here it means that one often finds a Roman Catholic, a\r\nChurch of England, a Methodist, and a Salvation Army school, all in\r\none little village--and no school whatever in the adjoining place.\r\n\r\nThe denominational spirit, fostered by these sectarian schools and\r\nsocieties, is so emphasized that Catholic and Protestant have little\r\nin common. Some preferred to let their children or themselves suffer\r\npain and inefficiency, rather than come for relief to a hospital where\r\nthe doctors were Protestant. This has in some measure passed away, but\r\nit was painfully real at first--so much so that once a rickety,\r\ncrippled child, easily cured, though he actually came to the harbour,\r\nwas forbidden to land and returned home to be a cripple for life.\r\n\r\nThe salaries available offer no attraction to enter the teaching\r\nprofession in this island; and there is no compulsory education law to\r\nassist those who with lofty motives remain loyal to the profession\r\nwhen \"better chances\" come along. Gauged rightly, there is no such\r\nthing as a better chance for fulfilling life's purposes than an\r\neducation; and modern conditions concede the right of a decent living\r\nwage to all who render service to the world in whatever line.\r\n\r\nIn the little village where are our headquarters there was already a\r\nChurch of England and a Methodist school when we came there, and a\r\nSalvation Army one has since been added. Threats of still another\r\n\"institution of learning\" menaced us at one time--almost like a new\r\nEgyptian plague, with more permanency of results thrown in.\r\n\r\nIf the motor power of the school boat is dissipated in sectarian\r\nreligious education, not to say focussed on it, the arrival of the\r\ncargo must be seriously handicapped. The statistical returns may show\r\na majority of our fishermen as \"able to read and write\"; but as a\r\nmatter of fact the illiteracy and ignorance of North Newfoundland and\r\nLabrador is the greatest handicap in the lives of the people.\r\n\r\nMy first scholar came from North Labrador, long before we aspired to a\r\nschool of our own. He was a lad of Scotch extraction and name, and\r\ncame aboard the hospital ship one night, as she lay at anchor among\r\nsome northern islands, with the request that we would take him up with\r\nus to some place where he could get an hour's schooling a day. He\r\noffered to work all the rest of the time in return for his food and\r\nclothing. To-day he holds a Pratt certificate, is head of our machine\r\nshop, has a sheet-metal working factory of his own which fills a most\r\nvaluable purpose on the shore, is general consultant for the coast in\r\nmatters of engineering, as well as being the Government surveyor for\r\nhis district. He is also chief musician for the church, having fitted\r\nhimself for both those latter posts in his \"spare time.\" The\r\ninspiration which his life has been is in itself an education to many\r\nof us--a reflex result which is the really highest value of all life.\r\n\r\nAs each transferred individual has come back North for service, desire\r\nhas at once manifested itself for similar privileges in young people\r\nwho had not previously shown even interest enough to attend our winter\r\nnight schools. This is the best evidence that inroads are being made\r\ninto that natural apathy which is content with mediocrity or even\r\ninferiority. This is everywhere the world's most subtle enemy. Even if\r\nselfishness or envy has been the motive, the fact remains that they\r\nhave often kindled that discontent with the past which Charles\r\nKingsley preached as necessary to all progress. Nowhere could the\r\npathology of the matter be more easily traced than in these concrete\r\nexamples carrying the infection which could come from no other quarter\r\ninto our isolation. It has been in very humble life an example of the\r\nreturn of the \"Yankee to the Court of King Arthur.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Lord Haldane proposed that every English child,\r\nwho in the Board schools had proved his ability to profit by it,\r\nshould be given a college or university education at the expense of\r\nthe State--as a remunerative outlay for the nation. This proposal was\r\nturned down as being too costly, though the expenditure for a single\r\nday's running of this war would have gone a long way to provide such\r\na fund. We now know that it can be done and must be done as a sign\r\nmanual of real freedom, which is not the leaving of parents or\r\nforbears, incompetent for any reason, free to damn their country with\r\na stream of stunted intellects.\r\n\r\nAmerica has already honoured herself forever by being a pioneer in\r\nthis movement for the higher education of the people. Religion surely\r\nneed not fear mental enlightenment. The dangers of life lie in\r\nignorance, and after all is not true religion a thing of the intellect\r\nas well as of the heart? Can that really be inculcated in \"two periods\r\nof forty minutes each week devoted to sectarian teaching,\" which was\r\none of the concessions demanded of us in our fight for a free public\r\nor common school at St. Anthony? My own mental picture of myself at\r\nthe age of seven sitting on a bench for forty minutes twice every week\r\nlearning to be \"religious\" made me sympathize with Scrooge when the\r\nGhost of the Past was paying him a visit.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. The young lives entrusted to us were having as\r\ngood medical care for their bodies as we could provide; and if we\r\ncould compass it, we were going to have that paralleled for their\r\nminds. The parents of the village children could do as they liked with\r\nthose committed to them--and they did it. There is nothing so\r\nthoroughly reactionary that I know of as religious prejudice well\r\nground in. As regards the treatment of physical ailments the\r\nprejudices of what Dr. Holmes called \"Homoeopathy and Kindred\r\nDelusions\" always are strong in proportion as they are impregnated\r\nwith some religious bias.\r\n\r\nOur efforts to combine the local schools having failed, we had to\r\nprovide a building of our own. This we felt must be planned for the\r\nfuture. For some day the halcyon days of peace on earth shall be\r\npermitted in our community, and the true loyalty of efficient service\r\nto our brothers will, it is to be hoped, become actually the paramount\r\nobject of our Christian religion. Perhaps this terrible war will have\r\nconvinced the world that the loftiest aspirations of mankind are no\r\nmore to save yourself hereafter than here. Is it not as true as ever\r\nthat if we are not ourselves possessors of Christ's spirit, ourselves\r\nwe cannot save?\r\n\r\nThe only schoolhouse available, anyhow, was not nearly so good a\r\nbuilding as that which we have since provided for the accommodation of\r\nour pigs! Fat pork is considered an absolute essential \"down North\";\r\nand it was cheaper and safer, according to Upton Sinclair, to raise\r\npigs than buy the salted or tinned article. So we had instituted what\r\nwe deemed a missionary enterprise in that line. (_Pace_ our vegetarian\r\nfriends.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sum of three thousand dollars had been raised, architect\r\nfriends at the Pratt Institute sent down to us competitive designs,\r\nand one of our Labrador boys, who had studied there, erected the\r\nbuilding. Having at the beginning no funds whatever for current\r\nexpenses, we had to look for volunteer teachers. One denomination\r\nhelped with part of its harbour grant, but the Government would not\r\nmake any special donation toward the union school project. Even the\r\ncaput grant, to which we had hoped that we were entitled for our own\r\norphanage children, had by law to go to the denomination to which\r\ntheir parents had belonged. This was not always easy to decide\r\ncorrectly. On the occasion of taking the last census in Labrador, a\r\nwell-dressed stranger suddenly visited one of our settlements on the\r\neast coast. It so happened that a very poor man with a large and\r\ngrowing family of eight children under ten years, who resided there,\r\nwas not so loyal to his church as we are taught we ought to be. When\r\nthe stranger entered his tilt a vision of material favours to be\r\nobtained was the dominant idea in the fisherman's mind. He was\r\ntherefore on tenterhooks all the while that the questioning was going\r\non lest some blunder of his might alienate the sympathy on which he\r\nwas banking for \"getting his share.\" At length it came to the\r\nmomentous point of \"What denomination do you belong to?\"--a very vital\r\nmatter when it comes to sympathy and sharing up. In some hesitation he\r\ngazed at the row of his eight unwashed and but half-clad offspring,\r\nwhose treacly faces gaped open-mouthed at the visitor. Then with\r\nsudden inspiration he decided to play for safety, and replied, \"Half\r\nof them is Church of England, and half is Methodist!\"\r\n\r\nBeing an unrecognized school, and so far off, some years went by\r\nbefore the innovation of bringing up scholars from our northern\r\ndistrict entered our heads. We realized at length, however, that we\r\nshould close one channel of criticism to the enemy if we proved that\r\nwe could justify our school by their standard of annual examinations.\r\nOur teachers, being mostly volunteers, had to come from outside the\r\nColony. Having no funds to purchase books and other supplies, we made\r\nuse of books also sent us from outside. The real value of the local\r\nexamination becomes questionable as a standard of success when far\r\nmore highly educated teachers, and at least as cleverly laid-out study\r\nbooks, prevented the children in our school from passing them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, further to waken their faculties, we had included in our\r\nfacilities a large upper hall of the school building and a library of\r\nsome thousands of books collected from all quarters. The former\r\nafforded the stimulus which entertainments given by the children\r\ncould carry, and also space for physical drill; the latter, that\r\ngreatest incentive of all, access to books which lure people to wish\r\nto read them. In summer the parents and older children are busy with\r\nthe fisheries day and night, and the little children run more or less\r\nwild, so this form of occupation was doubly desirable.\r\n\r\nThe generous help of summer volunteers, especially a trained\r\nkindergartner, Miss Olive Lesley, gave us a regular summer school. All\r\nthe expensive outfit needed was also donated. Eye and hand were\r\nenlisted in the service of brain evolution; while a piano, which it is\r\ntrue had seen better days, pressed the ear and the imagination into\r\nthe service as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the great gaps in child development in Labrador had been the\r\nalmost entire lack of games. The very first year of our coming the\r\nabsence of dolls had so impressed itself upon us that the second\r\nseason we had brought out a trunkful. Even then we found later that\r\nthe dolls were perched high up on the walls as ornaments, just out of\r\nreach of the children. In one little house I found a lad playing with\r\nsome marbles. For lack of better these were three-quarter-inch bullets\r\nwhich \"Dad had given him,\" while the alley was a full-inch round ball,\r\nwhich belonged to what my host was pleased to call \"the little\r\ndarlint\"--a hoary blunderbuss over six feet in length. The skipper\r\ninformed me that he had plenty of \"fresh\" for the winter, largely as a\r\nresult of the successful efforts of the \"darlint\"; though it appeared\r\nto have exploded with the same fatal effect this year as the season\r\nprevious. \"I hear that you made a good shot, the other day, Uncle\r\nJoe,\" I remarked. \"Nothing to speak on,\" he answered. \"I only got\r\nforty-three, though I think there was a few more if I could have found\r\nthem on the ice.\"\r\n\r\nThe pathos of the lack of toys and games appealed especially to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon, who believes that if he has any advantage over\r\ncompetitors, it is not merely in racial attributes, but in the\r\nreaction of those attributes which develop in him the ineradicable\r\nlove of athletics and sport. The fact that he dubs the classmate whom\r\nhe admires most \"a good sport,\" shows that he thinks so, anyway.\r\n\r\nSo organized play was carefully introduced on the coast. It caught\r\nlike wildfire among the children, and it was delightful to see groups\r\nof them naïvely memorizing by the roadside school lessons in the form\r\nof \"Ring-of-Roses,\" \"Looby-Loo,\" \"All on the Train for Boston.\" To our\r\ndismay in the minds of the local people the very success of this\r\neffort gave further evidence of our incompetence.\r\n\r\nOur people have well-defined, though often singular, ideas as to what\r\nAlmighty God does and does not allow; and among the pursuits which are\r\nirrevocably condemned by local oracles is dancing. The laxity of\r\n\"foreigners\" on this article of the Creed is proverbial. At the time\r\nthere were two ministers in the place, and realizing that the people\r\nconsidered that our kindergarten was introducing the thin edge of the\r\nwedge, and that our whole effort might meet with disaster unless the\r\nrumours were checked, I went in search of them without delay. Three\r\no'clock found us knocking at the kindergarten door. The teacher and\r\nsource of the reputed scandal seemed in no way disconcerted by the\r\nvisitation. The first game was irreproachable--every child was sitting\r\non the floor. But next the children, were choosing partners, and\r\nthough the boys had chosen boys, and the girls girls, the suspicions\r\nof the vigilance committee were aroused. No danger, however, to the\r\nthree R's transpired, and we were next successfully piloted clear of\r\ncondemnation through a game entitled \"Piggie-wig and Piggie-wee.\" Our\r\ncirculation was just beginning to operate once more in its normal\r\nfashion when we were told that the whole company would now \"join hands\r\nand move around in a circle\" to music. The entire jury sensed that the\r\ncrucial moment had come. We saw boys and girls alternating, hand held\r\nin hand--and all to the undeniably secular libretto of \"Looby-Loo.\" It\r\nwas, moreover, noted with inward pain that many of the little feet\r\nactually left the ground. We adjourned to an adjacent fish stage to\r\ndiscuss the matter. I need not dilate on the vicissitudes of the\r\nsession. It was clear that all but \"Looby-Loo\" could obviously be\r\nexcluded from the group of \"questionables\"--but the last game was of a\r\ndifferent calibre and must be put to vote. My readers will be relieved\r\nto learn that the resultant ballot was unanimously in favour of\r\nnon-interference, and that from the pulpit the following Sunday the\r\nclergy gave to the kindergarten the official sanction of the Church.\r\n\r\nOther outsiders now began telling the people that we could not pass\r\nthe Colony's examinations because we wasted our efforts on teaching\r\n\"foolishness\"; and the denomination which had hitherto lent us aid\r\nwithdrew it, and tried again to run a midget sectarian school right\r\nalongside. The first occasion, however, on which this institution came\r\nseriously to my attention was when the minister and another young man\r\ncame to call during the early weeks of our winter school session. The\r\nstranger was their special teacher. He was undoubtedly a smart lad; he\r\nhad passed the preliminary examination. But he was only sixteen, and\r\nin temperament a very young sixteen at that. He was engaged at a more\r\ngenerous salary than usual, and was perfectly prepared to\r\nrevolutionize our records. But, alas, not only was their little\r\nbuilding practically unfit for habitation, but after a week's waiting\r\nnot one single scholar had come to his school. The contrast between\r\nthe two opportunities was too great--except for frothing criticism.\r\nGladly, to help our neighbours out of a difficulty, we divided a big\r\nclassroom into two parts, added a third teacher to our school, and\r\nwere thus able to make an intermediate grade.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the whole reconstruction and work of the school\r\nwas made possible by the generous and loving interest of a lady in\r\nChicago. Added to the other anxieties of meeting our annual budget, we\r\ndid not feel able to bear the additional burden for which this venture\r\ncalled. One cannot work at one's best at any time with an anxious\r\nmind. The lady, however, was generous enough to give sufficient\r\nendowment to secure two teachers among other things, though she\r\nabsolutely refused to let even her name be known in connection with\r\nthe school. Our consolation is that we know that she has vision enough\r\nto realize the value of her gift and to accept that as a more than\r\nsufficient return.\r\n\r\nSeeing that some of our older scholars were able to find really useful\r\nand remunerative employment in teaching, and as only for those who\r\nheld certificates of having passed the local examinations were\r\naugmentation grants available, we decided to make special efforts to\r\nhave our scholars pass by the local standards. We, therefore, thanks\r\nto the endowment, engaged teachers trained in the country, and\r\ninstituted the curriculum of the Colony. These teachers told us that\r\nour school was better than almost any outside St. John's. Four\r\nscholars have passed this year; and now we have as head mistress a\r\ndelightful lady who holds the best percentage record for passing\r\nchildren through the requirements of the local examinations of any in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nSo much more deeply, however, do idle words sink into some natures\r\nthan even deeds, that one family preferred to keep their children at\r\nhome to risk sending them to our undenominational school; and there is\r\nno law to compel better wisdom with us here in the North.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we had already obtained a scale of our own for\r\ngrading success. For a number of our most promising boys and girls we\r\nhad raised the money for them to get outside the country what they\r\ncould never get in it, namely, the technical training which is so much\r\nneeded on a coast where we have to do everything for ourselves, and\r\nthe breadth of view which contact with a more progressive civilization\r\nalone can give them. The faculty of Pratt Institute gave us a\r\nscholarship, and later two of them; and with no little fear as to\r\ntheir ability to keep up, we sent two young men there. The newness of\r\nour school forced us to select at the beginning boys who had only\r\nreceived teaching after their working hours. Both boys and girls have\r\nalways had to earn something to help them on their way through. But\r\nthey have stood the test of efficiency so well that we look forward\r\nwith confidence to the future. A girl who took the Domestic Economy\r\ncourse at the Nasson Institute told me only to-day, \"It gave me a new\r\nlife altogether, Doctor\"; and she is making a splendid return in\r\nservice to her own people here.\r\n\r\nThe real test of education is its communal effect; and no education is\r\ncomplete which leaves the individual ignorant of the things that\r\nconcern his larger relationship to his country, any more than he is\r\nanything beyond a learned animal if he knows nothing of his\r\nopportunities and responsibilities as a son of God. But though\r\nexample is a more impelling factor than precept, undoubtedly the most\r\npermanent contributions conferred on the coast by the many college\r\nstudents, who come as volunteers every summer to help us in the\r\nvarious branches of our work, is just this gift of their own\r\npersonalities. Strangely enough, quite a number of these helpers who\r\nhave to spend considerable money coming and returning, just to give us\r\nwhat they can for the sole return of what that means to their own\r\nlives, have not been the sons of the wealthy, but those working their\r\nway through the colleges. These men are just splendid to hold up as\r\ninspirational to our own.\r\n\r\nThe access to books, as well as to sermons, may not be neglected. Our\r\nfaculties, like our jaws, atrophy if we do not use them to bite with.\r\nThe Carnegie libraries have emphasized a fact that is to education and\r\nthe colleges what social work is to medicine and the hospitals. We\r\nwere running south some years ago on our long northern trip before a\r\nfine leading wind, when suddenly we noticed a small boat with an\r\nimprovised flag hoisted, standing right out across our bows. Thinking\r\nthat it was at least some serious surgical case, we at once ordered\r\n\"Down sail and heave her to,\" annoying though it was to have the\r\ntrouble and delay. When at last she was alongside, a solitary,\r\nwhite-haired old man climbed with much difficulty over our rail.\r\n\"Good-day. What's the trouble? We are in a hurry.\" The old man most\r\ncourteously doffed his cap, and stood holding it in his hand. \"I\r\nwanted to ask you, Doctor,\" he said slowly, \"if you had any books\r\nwhich you could lend me. We can't get anything to read here.\" An angry\r\nreply almost escaped my lips for delaying a steamer for such a\r\npurpose. But a strange feeling of humiliation replaced it almost\r\nimmediately. Which is really charity--skilfully to remove his injured\r\nleg, if he had one, or to afford him the pleasure and profit of a good\r\nbook? Both services were just as far from his reach without our help.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you got any books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Doctor, I've got two, but I've read them through and through\r\nlong ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"One is the 'Works of Josephus,'\" he answered, \"and the other is\r\n'Plutarch's Lives.'\"\r\n\r\nI thought that I had discovered the first man who could honestly and\r\ntruthfully say that he would prefer for his own library the \"best\r\nhundred books,\" selected by Mr. Ruskin and Dr. Eliot, without even so\r\nmuch as a sigh for the \"ten best sellers.\"\r\n\r\nHe was soon bounding away over the seas in his little craft, the happy\r\npossessor of one of our moving libraries, containing some fifty books,\r\nranging from Henty's stories to discarded tomes from theological\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nEach year the hospital ship moves these library boxes one more stage\r\nalong the coast. As there are some seventy-five of them, they thus\r\nlast the natural life of books, since we have only rarely enjoyed the\r\nhelp of a trained librarian enabling us to make the most use of these\r\nalways welcome assets for our work. Later, some librarian friends from\r\nBrooklyn, chief among whom was Miss Marion Cutter, came down to help\r\nus; but our inability to have continuity when the ladies cannot afford\r\nto give their valuable services, has seriously handicapped the\r\nefficiency of this branch of the work. This, however, only spells\r\nopportunity, and when this war releases the new appreciation of\r\nservice, we feel confident that somehow we shall be able to fill the\r\ngap, and some one will be found to come and help us again to meet this\r\ngreat need.\r\n\r\nThe coöperation of teachers and librarians more than doubles the\r\ncapacity of each alone, and we believe sincerely that they do that of\r\ndoctors, as they unquestionably do that of the clergy. All the world's\r\nworkers have infinitely more to gain by coöperation than they often\r\nsuspect. And indeed we who are apostles of coöperation, as essential\r\nfor economy in distribution and efficiency in production, realize that\r\ngroups of workers pulling together always increase by geometrical\r\nprogression the result obtained.\r\n\r\nNone of our methods, however, tackled the smallest settlements, hidden\r\naway here and there in these fjords, especially those unreached by the\r\nmail steamers and devoid of means of transportation. Mahomet just\r\ncould not come to the mountain, so it had to go to him. A lady and a\r\nDoctor of Philosophy, Miss Ethel Gordon Muir, whose life had been\r\nspent in teaching, and who would have been excused for discontinuing\r\nthat function during her long vacations, came down at her own cost and\r\ncharges to carry the light to one of these lonely settlements. She has\r\nwith loyal devotion continued to carry on and enlarge that work ever\r\nsince, till finally she has built up a work that the clergyman of the\r\nmain section of coast affected, and also the Superintendent of\r\nEducation, have declared is the most effective branch of our Mission.\r\nHer band of teachers are volunteers. They come down to these little\r\nhamlets for the duration of their summer vacations. They live with the\r\nfishermen in their cottages and gather their pupils daily wherever\r\nseems best. Lack of proper accommodation and pioneer conditions\r\nthroughout in no way deter them. We expected that their criticism\r\nwould be, \"It is not worth while.\" That has never been the case.\r\nBefore the war they came again and again, as a testimony to their\r\nbelief in the value of the effort. Some have given promising children\r\na chance for a complete education in the States. Indeed, one such lad,\r\ntaken down some years ago by one of the students, entered Amherst\r\nCollege last year; while several were fighting with the American boys\r\n\"Over There.\"\r\n\r\nThe only real joy of possession is the power which it confers for a\r\nlarger life of service. Has it been the reader's good fortune ever to\r\nsave a human life? A cousin of mine, an officer in the submarine\r\nservice of the Royal Engineers, told me a year or two before the war\r\nthat he was never quite happy because he had spent all his life\r\nacquiring special capacities which he never in the least expected to\r\nbe able to put to practical use. This war has given to him, at least,\r\nwhat possessions could never have offered.\r\n\r\nIt almost requires the fabulous Jack to overcome the hoary giants of\r\nprejudice and custom, or the irrepressible energy of the Gorgon. It\r\nhas been helpful to remember away \"down North\" the stand which\r\nArchbishop Ireland took for public schools. When the Episcopal\r\nclergyman for Labrador, whom we had been influential in bringing out\r\nfrom England, decided to start an undenominational boarding-school on\r\nhis section of the coast, we began to hope that we might yet live to\r\nsee our sporadic effort become a policy. Laymen in St. John's, led by\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Edgar Jones, a most progressive clergyman, sympathized in\r\ndollars, and we were able to back the effort. A splendid volunteer\r\nhead teacher will arrive in the spring to begin work. The effort still\r\nneeds much help; but I am persuaded that a chain of undenominational\r\nschools can be started that will react on the whole country. Already a\r\nscheme for a similar uplift for the west coast is being promulgated.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to my wife some years ago I find that my\r\nconvictions on the subject of education were no less firm than they\r\nare to-day. One came to the conclusion that \"ignorance is the worst\r\ncause of suffering on our coast, and our 'religion' is fostering it.\r\nTrue, it has denominational schools, but these are to bolster up\r\nspecial ecclesiastical bodies, and are not half so good as Government\r\nschools would be. The 'goods delivered' in the schools are not\r\neducational in the best sense, and are all too often inefficiently\r\noffered. Instead of making the children ambitious to go on learning\r\nthrough life, they make them tired. There is no effort to stimulate\r\nthe play side; and in our north end of the Colony's territory there\r\nare no trades taught, no new ideas, no manual training--it is all\r\nso-called 'arts' and Creeds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\"WHO HATH DESIRED THE SEA?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are somewhat superstitious down here still, and not a few believe\r\nthat shoals and submerged rocks are like sirens which charm vessels to\r\ntheir doom.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, as late in the fall we were creeping up the Straits\r\nof Belle Isle in the only motor boat then in use there, our new toy\r\nbroke down, and with a strong onshore wind we gradually drifted in\r\ntoward the high cliffs. It was a heavy boat, and though we rowed our\r\nbest we realized that we must soon be on the rocks, where a strong\r\nsurf was breaking. So we lashed all our lines together and cast over\r\nour anchors, hoping to find bottom. Alas, the water was too deep.\r\nDarkness came on and the prospect of a long, weary night struggling\r\nfor safety made us thrill with excitement. Suddenly a schooner's\r\nlights, utterly unexpected, loomed up, coming head on toward us. Like\r\nSaul and his asses, we no longer cared about our craft so long as we\r\nescaped. At once we lashed the hurricane light on the boat-hook and\r\nwaved it to and fro on high to make sure of attracting attention. To\r\nour dismay the schooner, now almost in hail, incontinently tacked,\r\nand, making for the open sea, soon left us far astern. We fired our\r\nguns, we shouted in unison, we lit flares. All to no purpose. Surely\r\nit must have been a phantom vessel sent to mock us. Suddenly our\r\namateur engineer, who had all the time been working away at the\r\nscrap-heap of parts into which he had dismembered the motor, got a\r\nfaint kick out of one cylinder--a second--a third, then two, three,\r\nand then a solitary one again. It was exactly like a case of blocked\r\nheart. But it was enough with our oars to make us move slowly ahead.\r\nBy much stimulating and watchful nursing we limped along on the one\r\ncylinder, and about midnight found ourselves alongside the phantom\r\nship, which we had followed into the harbour \"afar off.\" Angry enough\r\nat their desertion of us in distress, we went aboard just to tell them\r\nwhat we thought of their behaviour. But their explanation entirely\r\ndisarmed us. \"Them cliffs is haunted,\" said the skipper. \"More'n one\r\nlight's been seen there than ever any man lit. When us saw you'se\r\nlight flashing round right in on the cliffs, us knowed it was no place\r\nfor Christian men that time o' night. Us guessed it was just fairies\r\nor devils trying to toll us in.\"\r\n\r\nWe had no lighthouses on Labrador in those days, and though hundreds\r\nof vessels, crowded often with women and children, had to pass up and\r\ndown the coast each spring and fall, still not a single island,\r\nharbour, cape, or reef had any light to mark it, and many boats were\r\nunnecessarily lost as a result.\r\n\r\nMost of the schooners of this large fleet are small. Many are old and\r\npoorly \"found\" in running gear. Their decks are so crowded with boats,\r\nbarrels, gear, wood, and other impedimenta, that to reef or handle\r\nsails on a dark night is almost impossible; while below they were\r\noften so crowded with women and children going North with their men\r\nfor the summer fishing on the Labrador shore, that I have had to crawl\r\non my knees to get at a patient, after climbing down through the main\r\nhatch. These craft are quite unfitted for a rough night at sea,\r\nespecially as there always are icebergs or big pans about, which if\r\ntouched would each spell another \"vessel missing.\" So the craft all\r\ncreep North and South in the spring and fall along the land, darting\r\ninto harbours before dark, and leaving before dawn if the night\r\nproves \"civil.\" Yet many a time I have seen these little vessels with\r\ntheir precious cargoes becalmed, or with wind ahead, just unable to\r\nmake anchorage, and often on moonless nights when the barometer has\r\nbeen low and the sky threatening. As there were no lights on the land,\r\nit would have been madness to try and make harbours after sundown.\r\n\r\nI have known the cruel, long anxiety of heart which the dilemma\r\ninvolved. It has been our great pleasure sometimes to run out and tow\r\nvessels in out of their distress. I can still feel the grip of one\r\nfine skipper, who came aboard when the sea eased down. The only\r\nharbour available for us had been very small, and the water too deep\r\nfor his poor gear. So when he started to drift, we had given him a\r\nline and let him hold on to us through the night, with his own stern\r\nonly a few yards from the cliffs under his lee, and all his loved\r\nones, as well as his freighters, a good deal nearer heaven than he\r\nwished them to be.\r\n\r\nWe had frequently written to the Government of this neglect of lights\r\nfor the coast. But Labrador has no representative in the Newfoundland\r\nParliament, and legislators who never visited Labrador had\r\nunimaginative minds. Year after year went by and nothing was done. So\r\nI spoke to many friends of the dire need for a light near Battle\r\nHarbour Hospital. Practically every one of the Northern craft ran\r\nright by us many times as they fished first in the Gulf and later on\r\nthe east coast, and so had to go past that corner of land. I have seen\r\na hundred vessels come and anchor near by in a single evening. When\r\nthe money was donated, our architect designed the building, and a\r\nfriend promised to endow the effort, so that the salary of the\r\nlight-keeper might be permanent. The material was cut and sent North,\r\nwhen we were politely told that the Government could not permit\r\nprivate ownership of lights--a very proper decision, too. They told us\r\nthat the year before money had been voted by the House for lights, and\r\nthe first would be erected near Battle Harbour. This was done, and the\r\nDouble Island Light has been a veritable Godsend to me as well as to\r\nthousands of others many times since that day.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FISH ON THE FLAKES]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: DRYING THE SEINES]\r\n\r\nOne hundred miles north of Indian Tickle, a place also directly in the\r\nrun of all the fishing schooners, a light was much needed. On a\r\ncertain voyage coming South with the fleet in the fall, we had all\r\ntried to make the harbour, but it shut down suddenly before nightfall\r\nwith a blanket of fog which you could almost cut with a knife, and\r\nbeing inside many reefs, and unable to make the open, we were all\r\nforced to anchor. Where we were exactly none of us knew, for we had\r\nall pushed on for the harbour as much as we dared. There were eleven\r\nriding-lights visible around us when a rift came in the fog. We hoped\r\nagainst hope that we had made the harbour. A fierce northeaster\r\ngathered strength as night fell, and a mighty sea began to heave in.\r\nSoon we strained at our anchors in the big seas, and heavy water swept\r\ndown our decks from bow to stern. Our patients were dressed and our\r\nboats gotten ready, though it all had only a psychological value.\r\nGradually we missed first one and then another of the riding-lights,\r\nand it was not difficult to guess what had happened. When daylight\r\nbroke, only one boat was left--a large vessel called the Yosemite, and\r\nshe was drifting right down toward us. Suddenly she touched a reef,\r\nturned on her side, and we saw the seas carry her over the breakers,\r\nthe crew hanging on to her bilge. Steaming to our anchors had saved\r\nus. All the vessels that went ashore became matchwood. But before we\r\ncould get our anchors or slip them, our main steam pipe gave out and\r\nwe had to blow down our boilers. It was now a race between the\r\nengineers trying to repair the damage and the shortening hours of\r\ndaylight. On the result depended quite possibly the lives of us all. I\r\ncannot remember one sweeter sound than the raucous voice of the\r\nengineer just in the nick of time calling out, \"Right for'ard,\" and\r\nthen the signal of the engine-room bell in the tell-tale in our little\r\nwheel-house. The Government has since put a fine little light in\r\nsummer on White Point, the point off which we lay.\r\n\r\nFarther north, right by our hospital at Indian Harbour, is a narrow\r\ntickle known as the \"White Cockade.\" Through this most of the fleet\r\npass, and here also we had planned for a lighthouse. When we were\r\nforbidden to put our material at Battle Harbour, we suggested moving\r\nto this almost equally important point. But it fell under the same\r\ncategory, and soon after the Government put a good light there also.\r\nThe fishermen, therefore, suggested that we should offer our\r\nperipatetic, would-be lighthouse to the Government for some new place\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nWe have not much now to complain of so far as the needs of our present\r\nstage of evolution goes. We have wireless stations, quite a number of\r\nlights, not a few landmarks, and a ten times better mail and transport\r\nservice than the much wealthier and more able Dominion of Canada could\r\nand ought to give to her long shore from Quebec to the eastern\r\n\"Newfoundland\" boundary on the Straits Labrador.\r\n\r\nHe is not a great legislator who only makes provision for certainties.\r\nTrue, the West has shown such riches and capacity that it has paid\r\nbetter to develop it first. But there is no excuse now whatever for\r\nneglecting the East. The Dominion would have been well advised,\r\nindeed, had she years ago built a railway to the east coast,\r\nshortening the steamer communication with England to only two nights\r\nat sea, and saving twenty-four hours for the mails between London and\r\nToronto. The war has shown how easily she could have afforded it. Most\r\nardently I had hoped that she might have turned some of her German\r\nprisoner labour in so invaluable a direction.\r\n\r\nHad the reindeer installation been handled by the Newfoundland\r\nGovernment years ago as it should have been, Labrador would have\r\nyielded to our boys in France a very material assistance in meat and\r\nfurs. Canada now could and should, if only in the interest of her\r\nnative population, begin on this problem as soon as peace is declared.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a thing possesses vitality is a guarantee that it will\r\ngrow if it can. Each new focus will expand, and caterpillar-like cast\r\noff its old clothing for better. The first necessity for economy and\r\nefficiency in our work has been to get our patients quickly to us or\r\nto be able to get to them. Experience has shown us that while boats\r\nentirely dependent on motors are cheapest, it is not always safe to do\r\nopen-sea work in such launches without a secondary and more reliable\r\nmeans of progression. The stories of a doctor's work in these launches\r\nwould fill a volume by themselves. The first Northern Messenger, a\r\nsmall \"hot-head\" boat, was replaced and sold to pay part of the cost\r\nof Northern Messenger number two. This in its turn was wrecked on an\r\nuncharted shoal with Dr. West on board, and her insurance used to help\r\nto procure Northern Messenger number three--which is the beautiful\r\nboat which now serves Harrington, our most westerly hospital. We are\r\nlargely indebted for her to Mr. William Bowditch, of Milton,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nDr. Hare, our first doctor at that station, never wrote his own\r\nexperiences, but one of the Yale volunteers who worked under him wrote\r\na story founded on fact, from which the following incident is\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\nOnce, running home before a wind in the Gulf, the doctor suddenly\r\nmissed his little son Pat, and looking round saw him struggling in the\r\nwater, already many yards astern. Dr. Hare, who was at the tiller at\r\nthe time, instantly jumped over after him. The child was finally\r\ndisappearing when he reached him at last and held his head above\r\nwater. Meanwhile the engineer, who had been below, jumped on deck to\r\nfind the sails flapping in the wind and the boat head to sea. With the\r\nintuitive quickness of our people in matters pertaining to the sea, he\r\ntook in the situation in a second, and though entirely alone\r\nmanoeuvred the boat so cleverly as to pick them both up before they\r\nperished in these frigid waters. Pat's young life was saved, only to\r\nbe given a short few years later in France for the same fight for the\r\nkingdom of righteousness which his home life had made his familiar\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThe forty-five-foot, \"hot-head\" yawl Daryl, given us by the Dutch\r\nReformed friends in New York, was sold to the Hudson Bay Company. At\r\nfirst she was naturally called the Flying Dutchman, and was most\r\nuseful; but here we have learned when a better instrument is available\r\nthat it is the truest economy to scrap-heap the old. We were to give\r\ndelivery of the boat in Baffin's Land. There were plenty of volunteers\r\nfor the task, for the tough jobs are the very ones which appeal to\r\nreal men. It would be well if the churches realized this fact and that\r\ntherein lies the real secret of Christianity. The impression that\r\nbeing a Christian is a soft job inevitably brings our religion into\r\ncontempt. I had been in England that spring, and had been able to\r\narrange that the mail steamer bound for Montreal on which I took\r\npassage should stop and drop me off Belle Isle if the crusaders who\r\nwere to take this launch on her long voyage North would stand out\r\nacross our pathway. Mr. Marconi personally took an interest in the\r\nventure. The launch was to wait at our most easterly Labrador station,\r\nand we were to keep telling her our position. The boat was in charge\r\nof Mr. John Rowland and Mr. Robert English, both of Yale. It created\r\nquite a furor among the passengers on our great ship, when she stopped\r\nin mid-ocean, as it appeared to them, and lowered an erratic doctor\r\nover the side on to a midget, whose mast-tops one looked down upon\r\nfrom the liner's rail. The sensation was all the more marked as we\r\ndisappeared over the rail clinging to two large pots of geraniums--an\r\nimportation which we regarded as very much worth while.\r\n\r\nWith an old Hudson Bay man, Mr. George Ford, to act as interpreter,\r\nand a Harvard colleague, who to his infinite chagrin was recalled by a\r\nwireless from his parents almost before starting, the little ship and\r\nher crew of three disappeared \"over the edge\" beyond communication. I\r\nshould mention that the Company had promised an engineer for the\r\nlaunch, but he had begged off when he understood the nature of the\r\nprojected expedition; so Yale decided that they were men enough to do\r\nwithout any outside help.\r\n\r\nSeptember had nearly gone, and no news had come from the boys. I owe\r\nsome one an infinite debt for a temperament which does not go halfway\r\nto meet troubles; but even I was a little worried when unkind rumours\r\nthat we had sold a boat that was not safe were capped by a father's\r\nletter to say that he \"had heard the reports\"! Fortunately, two days\r\nlater, as the Strathcona lay taking on whale meat for winter dog food\r\nat the northernmost factory, the Northern mail steamer came in. On\r\nboard were our returned wanderers, and papa, who had gone down as far\r\nas the Labrador steamer runs to look for them, as proud and happy as a\r\nman has a right to be over sons who do things. The boys had not only\r\nreached Baffin's Land, but had explored over a hundred miles of its\r\nuncharted coast-line, crossed to Cape Wolstenholme, navigated\r\nStupart's Bay--northeast of Ungava--and finally returned to Baffin's\r\nLand, coming back to Cartwright on the Hudson Bay Company's steamer\r\nPelican. It was a splendid record, especially when we remember the\r\nfierce currents and tremendous rise and fall of tides in that distant\r\nland. This latter was so great that having anchored one night in three\r\nfathoms of water in what appeared to be a good harbour, they had\r\nawakened in the morning to the fact that they were in a pond a full\r\nmile in the country, left stranded by the retiring tide.\r\n\r\nOur last \"hot-head,\" the Pomiuk, in a heavy gale of wind was smashed\r\nto atoms on a terrible reef of rocks off Domino Point a mile from\r\nland--fortunately with no one aboard. Yet another of our fine yawls,\r\nthe Andrew McCosh, given us by the students of Princeton, was driven\r\nfrom her anchors on to the dangerous Point Amour, where years ago,\r\nH.M.S. Lily was lost, and whose bones still lie bleaching on the rocky\r\nforeshore at the foot of the cliffs. Much as I love the sea, it made\r\none rather \"sore\" that it should serve us such a turn as wrecking the\r\nMcCosh. I have been on the sea for over thirty years and never lost a\r\nvessel while aboard her, but to look on while the waves destroyed so\r\nbeautiful a handmaid almost reconciled me to the statement that in\r\nheaven there shall \"be no more sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt was near this same spot that in November, 1905, a very old vessel,\r\nwhile trying to cross the Straits in a breeze, suddenly sprung a leak\r\nwhich sent her to the bottom in spite of all the pumping which could\r\nbe done. The six men aboard were able to keep afloat at that time of\r\nyear in the open Atlantic out of sight of land for five days and\r\nnights. They had nothing to eat but dry bread, and no covering of any\r\nkind. The winds were heavy and the seas high all the while. By\r\npatiently keeping their little boat's head to the wind with the oars,\r\nfor they had not any sails, day after day and night after night, and\r\nbacking her astern when a breaker threatened to overwhelm them, they\r\neventually reached land safe and sound.\r\n\r\nThe special interest about the launches has always been the pleasant\r\nconnection which they have enabled us to maintain with the\r\nuniversities. Yale crews, Harvard crews, Princeton crews, Johns\r\nHopkins crews, College of Physicians and Surgeons crews, and combined\r\ncrews of many others, have in succeeding years thus become interested.\r\nOccasionally these men have taken back some of their Labrador\r\nshipmates to the United States for a year's education, and in that and\r\nother ways, so they say, have they themselves received much real joy\r\nand inspiration.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain the interest which Canada had taken in our work,\r\nit had in some way to be organized. We had volunteer honorary\r\nsecretaries in a few cities, but no way of keeping them informed of\r\nour needs and our progress. In New England a most loyal friend, Miss\r\nEmma White, who ever since has been secretary and devoted helper of\r\nthe Labrador work there, had started a regular association with a\r\nboard of directors and had taken an office in Beacon Street, Boston.\r\nThis association now and again published little brochures of our work,\r\nor ordered out a few copies of the English magazine called \"The\r\nToilers of the Deep.\" It was suggested that we might with advantage\r\npublish a quarterly pamphlet of our own. This was made possible by the\r\ngenerous help of the late Miss Julia Greenshields, of Toronto, who\r\nundertook not only to edit, but also personally to finance any loss on\r\na little magazine to be entitled \"Among the Deep-Sea Fishers.\" This\r\nhas been maintained ever since, and has been responsible for helping\r\nto raise many of the funds to enable us to \"carry on.\"\r\n\r\nWe had also begun to get friends in New York. Dr. Charles Parkhurst,\r\nfamous especially for his plucky exposure of the former rottenness of\r\nthe police force of that city, had asked me to give an illustrated\r\nlecture at his mission in the Bowery. After my talk a gentleman\r\npresent, to my blank astonishment, gave me a cheque for five hundred\r\ndollars. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship with one who\r\nhas, for all the succeeding years, given far more than money, namely,\r\nthe constant inspiration of his own attitude to life and his wise\r\ncounsel--to say nothing of the value of the endorsation of his name.\r\nHis eldest son, one of the ablest of the rising New York architects,\r\nbecame chairman of the Grenfell Association of America, and gave us\r\nboth of his time and talent--he being responsible, as voluntary\r\narchitect, for many of our present buildings, including the Institute\r\nat St. John's, Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThis spread of interest in the United States greatly increased our\r\ncorrespondence, with an odd result. Americans apparently all believed\r\nthat this Colony was part of Canada, and that the postage was two\r\ncents as to the Dominion. This mistake left us six cents to pay on\r\nevery letter, and sixteen on any which were overweight. On one\r\noccasion the postmaster offered me so many taxable letters that I\r\ndecided to accept only one, and let the others go back. That one\r\ncontained a cheque for a hundred dollars for the Mission. I naturally\r\ntook the rest, and found every one of them to be bills, gossip, or\r\nfrom autograph-hunters.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry, our Postmaster-General informed me that it was not\r\npossible to arrange a two-cent postal rate with America. It had been\r\ntried and abandoned, because Canada wanted a share for carrying the\r\nletters through her territory. He told me, however, that he would\r\nagree gladly if the United States offered it. On my visit to\r\nWashington I had the honour of dining with Lord Bryce, our Ambassador\r\nthere and an old friend of my father's, and I mentioned the matter to\r\nhim. He could not, however, commend my efforts to the Government, as I\r\nhad no credentials as a special delegate. There was nothing to do but\r\ntake my place in the queue of importunates waiting to interview the\r\nPostmaster-General. When at length I had been moved to the top of the\r\nbench, I was called in, and very soon explained my mission. I received\r\na most cordial hearing, but merely the information that a note would\r\nbe made of my request and filed.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly flashed upon me that Americans had equal fishing rights with\r\nourselves on the Labrador coast, and that quite a number visited there\r\nevery year. Possibly the grant of a two-cent postage would be a welcome\r\nlittle \"sop\" to them. Mr. Meyer, who was the Postmaster-General at the\r\ntime, said that it made all the difference if the reduced rate would in\r\nany way encourage the American mercantile marine. He bade me draw a\r\ncareful list of reasons in favour of my proposal, and promised to give\r\nit careful attention.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a few days later I mentioned the matter to Colonel\r\nMcCook at whose home I was staying in New York. Colonel McCook, known\r\nas \"Fighting McCook,\" from the fact that he was the only one of nine\r\nbrothers not killed in the Civil War, at once took up the cudgels in\r\nmy behalf, left for Washington the following day, and wired me on the\r\nnext morning, \"All arranged. Congratulations\"--and I had the pleasure\r\nof telegraphing the Postmaster-General in St. John's that I had\r\narranged the two-cent postage rate with the United States and\r\nNewfoundland. A few days later I received a marked copy of a\r\nNewfoundland paper saying how capable a Government they possessed,\r\nseeing that now they had so successfully put through the two-cent post\r\nfor the Colony--and that was all the notice ever taken of my only\r\nlittle political intrigue; except that a year or two later, meeting\r\nMr. Meyer in Cambridge, he whispered in my ear, \"We were going out of\r\noffice in four days, or you would never have got that two-cent post\r\nlaw of yours through so easily.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1907 I was in England, and before I left, my old\r\nUniversity was good enough to offer me an honorary degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine of Oxford. As it was the first occasion that that respectable\r\nold University had ever given that particular degree to any one, I was\r\nnaturally not a little gratified. The day of the conferring of it will\r\never live in my memory. My cousin, the Professor of Paleontology, half\r\nof whose life was spent in the desert of Egypt digging for papyri in\r\nold dust-heaps, was considered the most appropriate person to stand\r\nsponsor for me--a would-be pioneer of a new civilization in the\r\nsub-arctic.\r\n\r\nThe words with which the Public Orator introduced me to the\r\nVice-Chancellor, being in Latin, seem to me interesting as a relic\r\nrather than as a statement of fact:\r\n\r\n\"Insignissime Vice-Cancellarie vosque egregii Procuratores: Adest\r\ncivis Britannicus, hujus academiæ olim alumnus, nunc Novum Orbem\r\nincolentibus quam nostratibus notus. Hic ille est qui quindecim abhinc\r\nannos in litus Labradorium profectus est, ut solivagis in mari Boreali\r\npiscatoribus ope medica succurreret; quo in munere obeundo Oceani\r\npericula, quæ ibi formidosissima sunt, contempsit dum miseris et\r\nmærentibus solatium ac lumen afferret. Nunc quantum homini licet, in\r\nipsius Christi vestigiis, si fas est dicere, insistere videtur, vir\r\nvere Christianus. Jure igitur eum laudamus cujus laudibus non ipse\r\nsolum sed etiam Academia nostra ornatur.\r\n\r\n\"Præsenta ad vos Wilfredum Thomassum Grenfell, ut admittatur ad gradum\r\nDoctoris in Medicina Honoris Causa.\"\r\n\r\nAs we, the only two Doctors Grenfell extant, marched solemnly back\r\ndown the aisle side by side, the antithesis of what doctorates called\r\nfor struck my sense of humour most forcibly. I had hired the gorgeous\r\nrobes of scarlet box cloth and carmine silk for the occasion, never\r\nexpecting to wear them again. But some years later, when yet another\r\nhonorary Doctorate, of Laws, was most generously conferred upon me by\r\na University of our American cousins, I felt it incumbent on me to\r\nuphold if possible the British end of the ritual. A cable brought me\r\njust in time the box-cloth surtout. Commencement ceremonies in the\r\nUnited States are in June; and the latitude was that of Rome. For\r\nyears I had spent the hot months always in the sub-arctic. The\r\nassembly hall was small and crowded to bursting--not even all the\r\ngraduating class could get in, much less all their friends. The\r\ntemperature was in three figures. The scarlet box cloth got hotter and\r\nhotter as we paraded in and about the campus. My face outrivalled the\r\ngown in colour. I have made many lobster men out of the boiled limbs\r\nof those admirable adjuncts of a Northern diet, but I had never\r\nexpected to pose as one in the flesh. The most lasting impression\r\nwhich the ceremony left on my mind is of my volunteer summer\r\nsecretary, who stood almost on my toes as he delivered the valedictory\r\naddress of his class. I still see his gradually wilting, boiled\r\ncollar, and the tiny rivulet which trickled down his neck as he warmed\r\nto his subject. We were the best of friends, but I felt that glow of\r\nsemi-satisfaction that comes to the man who finds that he is no longer\r\nthe only one seasick on board.\r\n\r\nAbout this time King Edward most graciously presented me, as one of\r\nhis birthday honours, with a Companionship in the Order of St. Michael\r\nand St. George--most useful persons for any man to have as companions,\r\nespecially in a work like ours, both being famous for downing dragons\r\nand devils. My American friends immediately knighted me. The papers\r\nand magazines knighted me in both the United States and Canada. But\r\nthat got me into trouble, for only kings can make pawns into knights,\r\nand I had to appeal several times to the Associated Press to save\r\nmyself being dubbed _poseur_. I have protested at meetings when the\r\nchairman has knighted me; at banquets, when the master of ceremonies\r\nhas knighted me. I gave it up lest accusation should arise against me,\r\nwhen at a semi-religious meeting I uttered a feeble protest against\r\nthe title to which I have no right, and my introducer merely repeated\r\nit the more firmly, informing the audience meanwhile that I was \"too\r\nmodest to use it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was attached to the conferring of the Order one elective\r\nlatitude--it could either be sent out or wait till I returned to\r\nEngland and attended a levee with the other recipients. I had a great\r\ndesire to see the King, and, though it meant a year's waiting, I\r\nrequested to be allowed to do so. This not only was most courteously\r\ngranted, but also the permission to let my presence in England be\r\nknown to the Hereditary Grand Chamberlain, and the King would give me\r\na private audience. When the day arrived, I repaired to Buckingham\r\nPalace, where I waited for an hour in the reception room in company\r\nwith a small, stout clergyman who was very affable. I learned later\r\nthat he was the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was carrying a fat Bible\r\nfrom Boston, England, I believe, to be presented to the United States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nAt last Sir Frederick Treves, who kindly acted as my introducer, took\r\nme up to the King's study--that King whose life his skill had saved.\r\nThere a most courteous gentleman made me perfectly at home, and talked\r\nof Labrador and North Newfoundland and our work as if he had lived\r\nthere. He asked especially about the American helpers and interest,\r\nand laughed heartily when I told him how many freeborn Americans had\r\ngladly taken the oath of loyalty to His Majesty, when called up to act\r\nas special constables for me in his oldest Colony. He left the\r\nimpression on my mind that he was a real Englishman in spirit, though\r\nhe had spoken with what I took to be a slight German accent. The\r\nsports and games of the Colony I had noticed interested him very much,\r\nand all references to the splendid seafaring genius of the people also\r\nfound an appreciative echo in his heart. When at last he handed me a\r\nlong box with a gorgeous medal and ribbon, and bade me good-bye, I\r\nvowed I could sing \"God save the King\" louder than ever if I could do\r\nso without harrowing the feelings of my more tuneful neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen later, as a major in an American surgical unit in France, I was\r\nserving the R.A.M.C., the ribbon of the Order was actually of real\r\nservice to me. It undoubtedly opened some closed doors, though it\r\nproved a puzzle to every A.D.M.S. to whom I had to explain the anomaly\r\nof my position when I had to go and worry him for permission to cross\r\nthe road or some new imaginary line. In England, and even in America,\r\nI found that the fact that the King had recognized one's work was a\r\nreal material asset. It was a credential--only on a larger scale--like\r\nthat from our Minister to the Colonies, the Marquis of Ripon, who\r\nkindly had given me his blessing in writing when first I visited\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nHow far signs of superiority are permissible is to my mind an open\r\nquestion. Hereditary human superiority does not necessarily exist,\r\nbecause selective precautions are not taken, and the environment of\r\nthe superior is very apt to enfeeble the physical machine, anyhow. The\r\nquestion of the hereditary superiority of a man's soul, being outside\r\nmy sphere, I leave to the theologians. History, which is the school of\r\nexperience, belies the theory, whatever current science may say. As\r\nfor the giving of hereditary titles, it is significant that they do\r\nnot as a rule go to scholars or even scientific men, but to physical\r\nfighters, being physical rewards for material services. When these are\r\nin the possession of offspring no longer capable of rendering such\r\nservices, it appears ridiculous that they should sail under false\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nTo make a man a hereditary duke for being humble and modest, or\r\nhereditary marquis for being unselfish and generous, or an earl for\r\nbeing a man of peace, and a benefactor in the things which make for\r\npeace, such as a good husband and father and comrade, has, so far as I\r\nknow, never been tried. Some of the so-called lesser honours, such as\r\nknighthood, are reserved for these. However, an order of knightly\r\ncitizens, so long as they are real knights, is, after all, little\r\nmore than the gold key of the Phi Beta Kappa, or the red triangle of\r\nthe Y.M.C.A. worker, or the Red Cross badge of the nurse. We are\r\nhuman, anyhow, and such concessions, seeing that they do have an\r\nundoubted stimulating value in the present stage of our development,\r\nto an Englishman seem permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE REINDEER EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLabrador will never be a \"vineland,\" a land of corn and wine, or a\r\ncountry where fenced cities will be needed to keep out the milk and\r\nhoney. But though there may be other sections of the Empire that can\r\nproduce more dollars, Labrador will, like Norway and Sweden, produce\r\nVikings, and it is said that the man behind the gun is still of some\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIn past years we have made quite extensive experiments in trying to\r\nadapt possible food supplies to this climate. I had seventeen bags of\r\nthe hardiest cereal seeds known sent me. They consisted of barley from\r\nLapland, from Russia, from Abyssinia, Mansbury barley and Finnish\r\noats. All the seeds came from the experimental station at Rampart,\r\nAlaska, and were grown in latitude 63° 30', which is two degrees north\r\nof Cape Chidley.\r\n\r\nI find in the notes of one of my earliest voyages my satisfaction at\r\nthe fact that a storm with lightning and thunder had just passed over\r\nthe boat and freshened up some rhubarb which I was growing in a box.\r\nIt had been presented to me by the Governor to carry down to Battle\r\nHarbour, and I was very eager that it, my first agricultural venture,\r\nshould not fail.\r\n\r\nEverywhere along the coast the inability to get a proper diet, owing\r\nto the difficulties of successful farming even on ever so small a\r\nscale, had aroused my mind to the necessity of doing something along\r\nthat line. In one small cottage I saw a poor woman zealously guarding\r\nan aged rooster.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got a hen?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\n\"No, Doctor; I had one, but she died last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why ever do you keep that rooster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I hopes some day to get a hen. I've had him five years. The last\r\nmanager of the mill gave him to me, but you'se sees he can't never go\r\nout and walk around because of the dogs, so I just keeps he under that\r\nsettle.\"\r\n\r\nPathetic as were her efforts at stock farming, I must admit that my\r\nsympathies were all with the incarcerated rooster.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the dogs seemed an insurmountable one. The Moravians'\r\nrecords abound in stories of their destructiveness. Mr. Hesketh\r\nPritchard writes: \"Dr. Grenfell records two children and one man\r\nkilled by the dogs. This is fortunately a much less terrible record\r\nthan that shown farther north by the Moravian Missions. The savage\r\ndogs did great harm at those stations one winter.\" Among other\r\naccidents, a boy of thirteen, strong and well, was coming home from\r\nhis father's kayak to his mother. After some time, as he did not\r\narrive, they went to search for him and found that the dogs had\r\nalready killed and eaten a good part of him. A full-grown man, driving\r\nto Battle Harbour Hospital, was killed by his dogs almost at our\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nThe wolves of the country only pack when deer are about. As a contrast\r\nto our dogs, wolves have never been known to kill a man in Labrador,\r\nso it would be more correct to speak of a doggish wolf than a wolfish\r\ndog. It is an odd thing and a fortunate one that in this country,\r\nwhere it is very common to have been bitten by a dog, we never have\r\nbeen able to find any trace of hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nA visitor returning to New York after a summer on the coast wrote as\r\nfollows: \"One of my lasting remembrances of Battle Harbour will be the\r\ndreadful dogs. The Mission team were on an island far removed, but\r\nthere were a number of settlers' dogs which delighted in making the\r\nnights hideous. Never before have I seen dogs stand up like men and\r\ngrapple with each other in a fight, and when made to move on, renew\r\nthe battle round the corner.\"\r\n\r\nOur efforts at agriculture had taught us not to expect too much of the\r\ncountry. A New Zealand cousin, Martyn Spencer, a graduate of Macdonald\r\nCollege of Agriculture, gave us two years' work. His experience showed\r\nthat while dogs continued to be in common use, cattle-raising was\r\nimpossible. Of a flock of forty Herdwick sheep given by Dr. Wakefield,\r\nthe dogs killed twenty-seven at one time. Angora goats, which we had\r\nimported, perished in the winter for lack of proper food. Our land\r\ncost so much to reclaim for hay, being soaked in humic acid, that we\r\nhad always to import that commodity at a cost which made more cows\r\nthan absolutely essential very inadvisable. Weasels, rats, hawks, and\r\nvermin needed a man's whole time if our chickens were to be properly\r\nguarded and repay keeping at all. An alfalfa sent us from Washington\r\ndid well, and potatoes also gave a fair return, though our summer\r\nfrosts often destroyed whole patches of the latter. Our imported plum\r\nand crabapple trees were ringed by mice beneath the snow in winter. At\r\na farm which we cleared nine miles up a bay, so as to have it removed\r\nfrom the polar current, our oats never ripened, and our turnips and\r\ncabbage did not flourish in every case. We could not plant early\r\nenough, owing to the ground being frozen till July some years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when we looked at the hundreds of thousands of\r\nsquare miles on which caribou could live and increase without any help\r\nfrom man, and indeed in spite of all his machinations, our attention\r\nwas naturally turned to reindeer farming, and I went to Washington to\r\nconsult Dr. Sheldon Jackson, the Presbyterian missionary from Alaska.\r\nIt was he who had pioneered the introduction by the United States\r\nGovernment of domestic reindeer into Alaska. At Washington we received\r\nnothing but encouragement. Reindeer could make our wilderness smile.\r\nThey would cost only the protection necessary. They multiply steadily,\r\nbreeding every year for eight or ten years after their second season.\r\nA selected herd should double itself every three years.\r\n\r\nThe skins are very valuable--there is no better nonconductor of heat.\r\nThe centre of the hair is not a hollow cylinder, but a series of air\r\nbubbles which do not soak water, and therefore can be used with\r\nadvantage for life-saving cushions. The skins are splendid also for\r\nmotor robes, and now invaluable in the air service. The meat is tender\r\nand appetizing, and sold as a game delicacy in New York. The deer\r\nfatten well on the abundant mosses of a country such as ours.\r\n\r\nSir William MacGregor, the Governor of Newfoundland at the time, had\r\nsamples of the mosses collected around the coast and sent to Kew\r\nBotanical Gardens for positive identification. The Cladonia\r\nRangiferina, or Iceland moss, proved very abundant. It was claimed,\r\nhowever, that the reindeer would eat any of such plants and shrubs as\r\nour coast offers in summer.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the year 1903 my interest in the domestication of deer\r\nhad led me to experiment with a young caribou. We had him on the\r\nStrathcona nearly all one summer. He was a great pet on board, and\r\ndemonstrated how easily trained these animals are. He followed me\r\nabout like a dog, and called after me as I left the ship's side in a\r\nboat if we did not take him with us. He was as inquisitive as a monkey\r\nor as the black bear which we had had two years before. We twice\r\ncaught him in the chart-room chewing up white paper, for on his first\r\nraid there he had found an apple just magnanimously sent us from the\r\nshore as a delicacy.\r\n\r\nFriends, inspired by Mr. William Howell Reed, of Boston, collected the\r\nmoney for a consignment of reindeer, and we accordingly sent to\r\nLapland to purchase as many of the animals as we could afford. The\r\nexpense was not so much in the cost of the deer as in the transport.\r\nThey could not be shipped till they had themselves hauled down to the\r\nbeach enough moss to feed them on their passage across the Atlantic.\r\nBetween two hundred and fifty and three hundred were purchased, and\r\nthree Lapp families hired to teach some of our local people how to\r\nherd them. When at last snow enough fell for the sledges to haul the\r\nmoss down to the landwash, it was dark all day around the North Cape.\r\n\r\nFifty years hence in all probability the Lapps will be an extinct\r\nrace, as even within the past twelve or fifteen years, districts in\r\nwhich thousands of domesticated reindeer grazed, now possess but a few\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\nThe good ship Anita, which conveyed the herd to us, steamed in for\r\nsouthern Newfoundland and then worked her way North as far as the ice\r\nwould permit. At St. Anthony everything was frozen up, and the men\r\nwalked out of the harbour mouth on the sea ice to meet the steamer\r\nbringing the deer. The whole three hundred were landed on the ice in\r\nCrémaillière, some three miles to the southward of St. Anthony\r\nHospital, and though many fell through into the sea, they proved hardy\r\nand resourceful enough to reach the land, where they gathered around\r\nthe tinkling bells of the old deer without a single loss from land to\r\nland.\r\n\r\nOne of our workers at St. Anthony that winter wrote that \"the most\r\nexciting moment was when the woman was lowered in her own sledge over\r\nthe steamer's side on to the ice, drawn to the shore, and transferred\r\nto one of Dr. Grenfell's komatiks, as she had hurt her leg on the\r\nvoyage. The sight of all the strange men surrounding her frightened\r\nher, but she was finally reassured, threw aside her coverings, and\r\nclutched her frying-pan, which she had hidden under a sheepskin. When\r\nshe had it safely in her arms she allowed the men to lift her and put\r\nher on the komatik.\" When the doctor at the hospital advised that her\r\nleg would best be treated by operation, the man said, \"She is a pretty\r\nold woman, and doesn't need a very good leg much longer.\" She was\r\nthirty-five!\r\n\r\nAn Irish friend had volunteered to come out and watch the experiment\r\nin our interest--and this he did most efficiently. The deer flourished\r\nand increased rapidly. Unfortunately the Lapps did not like our\r\ncountry. They complained that North Newfoundland was too cold for them\r\nand they wanted to return home. One family left after the first year.\r\nA rise in salary kept three of the men, but the following season they\r\nwanted more than we had funds to meet, and we were forced to decide,\r\nwrongly, I fear, to let them go. The old herder warned me, \"No Lapps,\r\nno deer\"; but I thought too much in terms of Mission finances, the\r\nGovernment having withdrawn their grant toward the herders' salaries.\r\nTrusting to the confidence in their own ability of the locally trained\r\nmen, I therefore let the Lapp herders go home. The love of the Lapps\r\nfor their deer is like a fisherman's for his vessel, and seems a\r\nmaster passion. They appeared even to grudge our having any deer\r\ntethered away from their care.\r\n\r\nTo us it seemed strange that these Lapps always contended that the\r\nwork was too hard, and that the only reason that they were always gone\r\nfrom camp was that there were no wolves to keep the herd together.\r\nThey claimed that we must have a big fence or the deer would go off\r\ninto the country. They, of course, both when with us and in Lapland as\r\nwell, lived and slept where the herd was. They told us that the deer\r\nno longer obeyed the warning summons of the old does' bells, having no\r\nnatural enemy to fear; and one told me, \"Money no good, Doctor, if\r\nherd no increase.\" Reindeer seemed to be the complement of their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Alaskan experiment was realizing all of Dr. Jackson's\r\nhappiest hopes; but it had a strong Government grant and backing and\r\nplenty of skilled superintendence. The lack of those were our\r\nweaknesses. Our deer thrived splendidly and multiplied as we had\r\npredicted. We went thirty miles in a day with them with ease. We\r\nhauled our firewood out, using half a dozen hauling teams every day.\r\nEvery fortnight during the rush of patients at the hospital in summer\r\nwe could afford to kill a deer. The milk was excellent in quality and\r\nsweet, and preserved perfectly well in rubber-capped bottles. The\r\ncheese was nourishing and a welcome addition to the local diet. At the\r\nclose of the fourth year we had a thousand deer.\r\n\r\nA paper of the serious standing of the \"Wall Street Journal,\" writing\r\nat about that time, under the title \"Reindeer Venison from Alaska,\"\r\nhad this to say: \"At different times in the past twenty years the\r\nGovernment imported reindeer into Alaska--about twelve hundred in\r\nall--in hopes to provide food for the natives in the future. The plan\r\ncaused some amusement and some criticism at the time. Subsequent\r\ndevelopments, however, have justified the attempt. The herds have now\r\nincreased to about forty thousand animals, and are rapidly becoming\r\nstill more numerous. The natives own about two thirds of the number.\r\nShipments of meat have been made to the Pacific Coast cities. Last\r\nyear the sales of venison and skins amounted to $25,000. It is claimed\r\nthat the vast tundra, or treeless frozen plains of Alaska, will\r\nsupport at least ten million animals. The federal authorities in\r\ncharge are so optimistic of the future outlook that the prediction is\r\nmade that within twenty-five years the United States can draw a\r\nconsiderable part of its meat supply from Alaska.\" What can be done in\r\nAlaska can be done in Labrador, and with its better facilities for\r\nshipping and handling the product, the greater future ought to be the\r\nprize of the latter country.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1912 there were five hundred fawns, and at one time\r\nwe had gathered into our corral for tagging no less than twelve\r\nhundred and fifty reindeer. Of these we sold fifty to the Government\r\nof Canada for the Peace River District. There they were lost because\r\nthey were placed in a flat country, densely wooded with alders, and\r\nnot near the barren lands. We also sold a few to clubs, in order to\r\ntry and introduce the deer. These sales would have done the experiment\r\nno injury, but with the fifty to Canada went my chief herder and two\r\nof my other herders from Labrador. This loss, from which we never\r\nrecovered, coincided with an outbreak of hostility toward the deer\r\namong the resident population, who live entirely on the sea edge. Only\r\nlong afterwards did we find out that it was partly because they feared\r\nthat we would force deer upon them and do away with their dogs. The\r\nlocal Government official told me only the other day that the second\r\ngeneration from this would have very little good to say of the\r\nshort-sightedness of these men who let such a valuable industry fail\r\nto succeed.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing cares of the enlarging Mission, with Lieutenant\r\nLindsay gone back to Ireland, and no one to superintend the herding,\r\nthe successful handling of the deer imperceptibly declined. The tags\r\non the ears were no longer put in; the bells were not replaced in the\r\nold localities. The herd was driven, not led as before--was paid for,\r\nnot loved. These differences at the time were marked by increasing\r\npoaching on the herd by the people. Here and there at first they had\r\nkilled a deer unknown to us; and finally we caught one hidden in a\r\nman's woodpile, and several offenders were sent to jail.\r\n\r\nWe appealed to the Newfoundland Government for protection, as to be\r\npoliceman and magistrate for the herd which one held in trust was an\r\nanomalous position. I was ordered by them to sit on the bench when\r\nthese cases were up, as I did not own the deer. The section of land on\r\nwhich we had the animals is a peninsula of approximately one hundred\r\nand fifty square miles. It is cut off by a narrow, low neck about\r\neight miles long. During all our years of acquaintance with the coast\r\nnot a dozen caribou had been killed on it, for they do not cross the\r\nneck to the northward. But when we applied for a national preserve,\r\nthat no deer at all might be killed on the peninsula, and so we might\r\nrun a big fence across the neck with a couple of herders' houses along\r\nthe line of it, a petition, signed by part of the \"voters,\" went up to\r\nSt. John's, against such permission being granted us. The petition\r\nstated that the deer destroyed the people's \"gardens,\" that they were\r\na danger to the lives of the settlers, whose dogs went wild when they\r\ncrossed their path, and they claimed that the herd \"led men into\r\ntemptation,\" because if there were no reindeer to tempt men to kill\r\nthem, there would be none killed. The deer thus were supposed to be\r\nthe cause of making cattle-thieves out of honest men! The result was\r\nthat a law was passed that no domestic reindeer might be shot north of\r\nthe line of the neck for which we had applied, and which we\r\nintended to fence. This only made matters ten times worse, for if the\r\ndeer either strayed or else were driven across the line, the killing\r\nof them was thus legalized.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: A PART OF THE REINDEER HERD]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: REINDEER TEAMS MEETING A DOG TEAM]\r\n\r\nThe deer had cost us, landed, some fifty-one dollars apiece. Three\r\nyears of herding under the adverse conditions of lack of support from\r\neither Government or people had not lessened the per caput expense\r\nvery materially. If we had shot some one's fifty-dollar cow, our name\r\nwould have been anathema--but we lost two hundred and fifty deer one\r\nwinter. In addition to this, when we moved the deer to a spot near\r\nanother village on a high bluff, over a hundred died in summer,\r\neither--according to the report of the herders--from falling over the\r\ncliffs driven by dogs, or of a sickness of which we could not discover\r\nthe nature, though we thought that it resembled a kind of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe poaching got so bad that we took every means in our power to catch\r\nthe guilty parties. But it was a very difficult thing to do. A dead\r\ndeer lies quiet, keeps for weeks where he falls in our winter climate,\r\nand can be surreptitiously removed by day or night. The little Lapp\r\ndogs occasionally scented them beneath the snow, and many tell-tale\r\n\"paunches\" showed where deer had been killed and carried off.\r\n\r\nI had been treating the hunchback boy and only child of a fisherman\r\nfor whom I had very great respect. His was the home where the\r\nMethodist minister always boarded, and he was looked upon as a pillar\r\nof piety. After a straightening by frame treatment, the boy's spine\r\nhad been ankylosed by an operation; and as every one felt sorry for\r\nthe little fellow, we were often able to send him gifts. One day the\r\nfather came to me, evidently in great trouble, to have what proved to\r\nbe a most uncommon private talk. To my utter surprise he began:\r\n\"Doctor, I can no longer live and keep the secret that I shot two of\r\nyour reindeer. I have brought you ninety dollars, all the cash that I\r\nhave, and I want to ask your forgiveness, after all you have done for\r\nme.\" Needless to say, it was freely given, but it made me feel more\r\nthan ever that the deer must be moved to some other country.\r\n\r\nIt was about this year that the Government for the first time granted\r\nus a resident policeman--previously we had had to be our own police.\r\nFortunately the man sent was quite a smart fellow. A dozen or so deer\r\nhad been killed along the section of our coast, and so skilfully that\r\neven though it was done under the noses of the herders no evidence to\r\nconvict could be obtained. It so happened, however, that while one of\r\nthe herders was eating a piece of one of the slaughtered animals which\r\nhe had discovered, and that the thieves had not been able to carry\r\noff, his teeth met on a still well-formed rifle bullet of number 22\r\ncalibre. This type of rifle we knew was scarcely ever used on our\r\ncoast, and the policeman at once made a round to take every one. He\r\nreturned with three, which was really the whole stock.\r\n\r\nA piece of meat was now placed at a reasonable distance, also some\r\nbags of snow, flour, etc., and a number of bullets fired into them.\r\nThese bullets were then all privately marked, and shuffled up. Our own\r\ndeductions were made, and a man from twenty miles away summoned,\r\narrested, and brought up. He brought witnesses and friends, apparently\r\nto impress the court--one especially, who most vehemently protested\r\nthat he knew the owner of the rifle, and that he was never out of his\r\nhouse at the time that the deer would have been killed. In court was a\r\nman, for twenty-seven years agent in Labrador for the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany--a crack shot and a most expert hunter. He was called up,\r\ngiven the big pile of bullets, and told to try and sort them, by the\r\ngroove marks, into those fired by the three different rifles. We then\r\nhanded him the control bullet, and he put it instantly on one of the\r\npiles. It was the pile that had been fired from the rifle of the\r\naccused. This man, in testifying, in order to clear himself, had let\r\nout the fact that his rifle had not been kept in his house, but in the\r\nhouse of the vociferous witness--whom we now arrested, convicted, and\r\ncondemned to jail for six months or two hundred dollars fine--the\r\nlatter alternative being given only because we knew that he had not\r\nthe necessary sum. Protesting as loudly as he had previously\r\nwitnessed, he went to jail; but the rest let out threats that they\r\nwere coming back with others to set him free. We had only a frame\r\nwooden jail, and a rheumatic jailer of over seventy years, hired to\r\nhobble around by day and see that the prisoners were fed and kept\r\norderly. We announced, therefore, that our Hudson Bay friend, with his\r\nrifle loaded, would be night jailer.\r\n\r\nA few days passed by. The prisoner did not like improving the public\r\nthoroughfare for our benefit, while those \"who were just as bad as he\"\r\nwent free. Our old jailer took good care that he should hear what good\r\ntimes they were having and laughing at him for being caught. Indeed,\r\nhe liked it so little that he gave the whole plot away--at least what\r\nhe called the whole. This landed four more of his friends in the same\r\nhonest and public-spirited occupation which he was himself pursuing;\r\nthough all escaped shortly afterwards by paying fines to the\r\nGovernment which aggregated some eight hundred dollars--which sum was\r\nlargely paid by others for them.\r\n\r\nThere was no way, however, definitely to stop the steady decrease in\r\nthe numbers of the herd; and though we moved them to new pastures\r\naround the coast, and fenced them in such small mobile corrals as we\r\ncould afford, they were not safe. On several occasions we found dead\r\ndeer with buckshot in them, which had \"fallen over the cliffs.\" Twice\r\nwe discovered that deer had even been killed within our own corral.\r\nOne had been successfully removed, and the other trussed-up carcass\r\nhad been hidden until a good opportunity offered for it to follow\r\nsuit. I do not wish to leave the impression on the minds of my readers\r\nthat every man on this part of the coast is a poacher. Far from it.\r\nBut the majority of the best men were against the reindeer experiment\r\nfrom the moment that the first trouble arose. A new obligation of\r\nsocial life was introduced. This implied restraint in such trifling\r\nthings as their having to fence their tiny gardens, protect small\r\nstray hay-pooks, and discriminate into what they discharged their\r\nubiquitous blunderbusses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the steadily increasing demand for meat, especially since\r\nthe war began, caused outside interest in the experiment; and both the\r\nowners of Anticosti Island, and a firm in the West who were commencing\r\nreindeer farming on a commercial basis, opened negotiations with us\r\nfor the purchase of our herd. In the original outlay, however, the\r\nCanadian Dominion Government had taken an interest to the amount of\r\nfive thousand dollars, so it was necessary to get their opinion on the\r\nsubject. Their Department of Indian Affairs happened to be looking for\r\nsome satisfactory way of helping out their Labrador Indian population.\r\nThey sent down and made inquiries, and came to the conclusion that\r\nthey would themselves take the matter up, as they had done with\r\nbuffalo, elk, and other animals in the West.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 all preparations for transferring the deer were made, but war\r\nconditions called their steamer away and transport was delayed until\r\n1918. Again their steamer was called off, so we decided to take the\r\ndeer across ourselves in our splendid three-masted schooner, the\r\nGeorge B. Cluett. She, alas, was delayed in America by the submarine\r\nscare, and it was the end of September instead of June when she\r\nfinally arrived. It was a poor season for our dangerous North coast\r\nand a very bad time for moving the deer, whose rutting season was just\r\nbeginning. My herders, too, were now much reduced in numbers. Most of\r\nthem had gone to the war, and as one had been sick all summer,\r\npractically only two were available. To add to the difficulty, many\r\nsmall herds of reindeer were loose in the country outside the corral.\r\n\r\nHowever, we felt that the venture must be attempted at all hazards,\r\neven if it delayed our beautiful ship taking a cargo of food to the\r\nAllies--as she was scheduled to do as soon as possible--and though it\r\nwas a serious risk to remain anchored in the shallow open roadstead\r\noff the spot where the deer had to be taken aboard. The work was all\r\nnew to us. The deer, instead of being tame as they had previously\r\nbeen, were wild at best, and wilder still from their breeding season.\r\nThe days went by, and we succeeded in getting only a few aboard. We\r\nwere all greenhorns with the lassoes and lariats which we improvised.\r\nA gale of wind came on and nothing could be done but lie up.\r\n\r\nThen followed a fine Sunday morning. It was intensely interesting to\r\nnote the attitude which my crew could take toward my decision to work\r\nall day after morning prayers. We talked briefly over the emphasis\r\nlaid by the four Evangelists on Christ's attitude toward the day of\r\nrest, and what it might mean, if we allowed a rare fine day to go by,\r\nto that long section of coast which we had not yet this year visited,\r\nand which might thus miss the opportunity of seeing a doctor before\r\nChristmas. As since this war has begun I have felt that the Christ\r\nwhom I wanted to follow would be in France, so now I felt that the\r\nChrist of my ideal would go ashore and get those deer in spite of the\r\ngreat breach of convention which it would mean for a \"Mission\" doctor\r\nto work in any way, except in the many ways he has to work every\r\nSunday of his life. The whole crew followed me when I went ashore,\r\nsaying that they shared my view--all except the mate, who spent his\r\nSunday in bed. Idleness is not rest to some natures, either to body or\r\nmind, and when at night we all turned in at ten o'clock, wet\r\nthrough--for it had rained in the evening--and tired out, we were able\r\nto say our prayers with just as light hearts, feeling that we had put\r\nsixty-eight deer aboard, as if we had enjoyed that foretaste of what\r\nsome still believe to be the rest of heaven. Rest for our souls we\r\ncertainly had, and to some of us that is the rest which God calls His\r\nown and intends shall be ours also. When later I spoke to some young\r\nmen about this, it seemed to them a Chestertonian paradox, that we\r\nshould actually hold a Sunday service and then go forth to render it.\r\nThey thought that Sunday prayers had to do only with the escaping the\r\nconsequences of one's sins.\r\n\r\nI still believe that we were absolutely right in our theory of the\r\nintroduction of the deer into this North country, and that we shall be\r\njustified in it by posterity. That these thousands of miles, now\r\nuseless to men, will be grazed over one day by countless herds of deer\r\naffording milk, meat, clothing, transport, and pleasure to the human\r\nrace, is certain. They do not by any means destroy the land over which\r\nthey rove. On the contrary, the deep ruts made by their feet, like the\r\nponies' feet in Iceland, serve to drain the surface water and dry the\r\nland. The kicking and pawing of the moss-covered ground with their\r\nspade-like feet tear it up, level it, and cut off the dense moss and\r\ncreeping plants, bring the sub-soil to the top, and over the whole the\r\nbig herd spreads a good covering of manure.\r\n\r\nReindeer-trodden barrens, after a short rest, yield more grass and\r\ncattle food than ever before. No domesticated animal can tolerate the\r\ncold of this country and find sustenance for itself as can the deer.\r\nIt can live as far north as the musk-ox. Peary found reindeer in\r\nplenty on the shores of the polar sea. The great barren lands of\r\nCanada, from Hudson Bay north of Chesterfield Inlet away to the west,\r\ncarry tens of thousands of wild caribou. Mr. J.B. Tyrrell's\r\nphotographs show armies of them advancing; the stags with their lordly\r\nhorns are seen passing close to the camera in serried ranks that seem\r\nto have no end.\r\n\r\nOur own experiment is far from being a failure. It has been a success,\r\neven if only the corpse is left in Newfoundland. We have proved\r\nconclusively that the deer can live, thrive, and multiply on the\r\notherwise perfectly valueless areas of this North country, and furnish\r\na rapidly increasing domesticated \"raw material\" for a food and\r\nclothing supply to its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ICE-PAN ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday, the 21st of April, 1908, it was still winter with us\r\nin northern Newfoundland. Everything was covered with snow and ice. I\r\nwas returning to the hospital after morning service, when a boy came\r\nrunning over with the news that a large team of dogs had come from\r\nsixty miles to the southward to get a doctor to come at once on an\r\nurgent case. A fortnight before we had operated on a young man for\r\nacute bone disease of the thigh, but when he was sent home the people\r\nhad allowed the wound to close, and poisoned matter had accumulated.\r\nAs it seemed probable that we should have to remove the leg, there was\r\nno time to be lost, and I therefore started immediately, the\r\nmessengers following me with their team.\r\n\r\nMy dogs were especially good ones and had pulled me out of many a\r\nprevious scrape by their sagacity and endurance. Moody, Watch, Spy,\r\nDoc, Brin, Jerry, Sue, and Jack were as beautiful beasts as ever\r\nhauled a komatik over our Northern barrens. The messengers had been\r\nanxious that their team should travel back with mine, for their\r\nanimals were slow at best, and moreover were now tired from their long\r\njourney. My dogs, however, were so powerful that it was impossible to\r\nhold them back, and though I twice managed to wait for the following\r\nsledge, I had reached a village twenty miles to the south and had\r\nalready fed my team when the others caught up.\r\n\r\nThat night the wind came in from sea, bringing with it both fog and\r\nrain, softening the snow and making the travelling very difficult.\r\nBesides this a heavy sea began heaving into the bay on the shores\r\nof which lay the little hamlet where I spent my first night. Our\r\njourney the next day would be over forty miles, the first ten lying on\r\nan arm of the sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: A SPRING SCENE AT ST. ANTHONY]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: DOG RACE AT ST. ANTHONY]\r\n\r\nIn order not to be separated too long from my friends I sent them\r\nahead of me by two hours, appointing as a rendezvous the log tilt on\r\nthe other side of the bay. As I started the first rain of the year\r\nbegan to fall, and I was obliged to keep on what we call the\r\n\"ballicaters,\" or ice barricades, for a much longer distance up the\r\nbay than I had anticipated. The sea, rolling in during the previous\r\nnight, had smashed the ponderous layer of surface ice right up to the\r\nlandwash. Between the huge ice-pans were gaping chasms, while half a\r\nmile out all was clear water.\r\n\r\nThree miles from the shore is a small island situated in the middle of\r\nthe bay. This had preserved an ice bridge, so that by crossing a few\r\ncracks I managed to get to it safely. From that point it was only four\r\nmiles to the opposite shore, a saving of several miles if one could\r\nmake it, instead of following the landwash round the bay. Although the\r\nice looked rough, it seemed good, though one could see that it had\r\nbeen smashed up by the incoming sea and packed in tight again by the\r\neasterly wind. Therefore, without giving the matter a second thought,\r\nI flung myself on the komatik and the dogs started for the rocky\r\npromontory some four miles distant.\r\n\r\nAll went well till we were within about a quarter of a mile of our\r\nobjective point. Then the wind dropped suddenly, and I noticed\r\nsimultaneously that we were travelling over \"sish\" ice. By stabbing\r\ndown with my whip-handle I could drive it through the thin coating of\r\nyoung ice which had formed on the surface. \"Sish\" ice is made up of\r\ntiny bits formed by the pounding together of the large pans by the\r\nheavy seas. So quickly had the wind veered and come offshore, and so\r\nrapidly did the packed slob, relieved of the inward pressure of the\r\neasterly breeze, \"run abroad,\" that already I could not see any pan\r\nlarger than ten feet square. The whole field of ice was loosening so\r\nrapidly that no retreat was possible.\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to lose. I dragged off my oilskins and threw\r\nmyself on my hands and knees beside the komatik so as to give a larger\r\nbase to hold, shouting at the same time to my team to make a dash for\r\nthe shore. We had not gone twenty yards when the dogs scented danger\r\nand hesitated, and the komatik sank instantly into the soft slob. Thus\r\nthe dogs had to pull much harder, causing them to sink also.\r\n\r\nIt flashed across my mind that earlier in the year a man had been\r\ndrowned in this same way by his team tangling their traces around him\r\nin the slob. I loosened my sheath-knife, scrambled forward and cut the\r\ntraces, retaining the leader's trace wound securely round my wrist.\r\n\r\nAs I was in the water I could not discern anything that would bear us\r\nup, but I noticed that my leading dog was wallowing about near a piece\r\nof snow, packed and frozen together like a huge snowball, some\r\ntwenty-five yards away. Upon this he had managed to scramble. He shook\r\nthe ice and water from his shaggy coat and turned around to look for\r\nme. Perched up there out of the frigid water he seemed to think the\r\nsituation the most natural in the world, and the weird black marking\r\nof his face made him appear to be grinning with satisfaction. The rest\r\nof us were bogged like flies in treacle.\r\n\r\nGradually I succeeded in hauling myself along by the line which was\r\nstill attached to my wrist, and was nearly up to the snow-raft, when\r\nthe leader turned adroitly round, slipped out of his harness, and once\r\nmore leered at me with his grinning face.\r\n\r\nThere seemed nothing to be done, and I was beginning to feel drowsy\r\nwith the cold, when I noticed the trace of another dog near by. He had\r\nfallen through close to the pan, and was now unable to force his way\r\nout. Along his line I hauled myself, using him as a kind of bow\r\nanchor--and I soon lay, with my dogs around me, on the little island\r\nof slob ice.\r\n\r\nThe piece of frozen snow on which we lay was so small that it was\r\nevident we must all be drowned if we were forced to remain on it as it\r\nwas driven seaward into open water. Twenty yards away was a larger and\r\nfirmer pan floating in the sish, and if we could reach it I felt that\r\nwe might postpone for a time the death which seemed inescapable. To my\r\ngreat satisfaction I now found that my hunting knife was still tied on\r\nto the back of one of the dogs, where I had attached it when we first\r\nfell through. Soon the sealskin traces hanging on the dogs' harnesses\r\nwere cut and spliced together to form one long line. I divided this\r\nand fastened the ends to the backs of my two leaders, attaching the\r\ntwo other ends to my own wrists. My long sealskin boots, reaching to\r\nmy hips, were full of ice and water, and I took them off and tied them\r\nseparately on the dogs' backs. I had already lost my coat, cap,\r\ngloves, and overalls.\r\n\r\nNothing seemed to be able to induce the dogs to move, even though I\r\nkept throwing them off the ice into the water. Perhaps it was only\r\nnatural that they should struggle back, for once in the water they\r\ncould see no other pan to which to swim. It flashed into my mind that\r\nmy small black spaniel which was with me was as light as a feather and\r\ncould get across with no difficulty. I showed him the direction and\r\nthen flung a bit of ice toward the desired goal. Without a second's\r\nhesitation he made a dash and reached the pan safely, as the tough\r\nlayer of sea ice easily carried his weight. As he lay on the white\r\nsurface looking like a round black fuss ball, my leaders could plainly\r\nsee him. They now understood what I wanted and fought their way\r\nbravely toward the little retriever, carrying with them the line that\r\ngave me yet another chance for my life. The other dogs followed them,\r\nand all but one succeeded in getting out on the new haven of refuge.\r\n\r\nTaking all the run that the length of my little pan would afford, I\r\nmade a dive, slithering along the surface as far as possible before I\r\nonce again fell through. This time I had taken the precaution to tie\r\nthe harnesses under the dogs' bellies so that they could not slip them\r\noff, and after a long fight I was able to drag myself onto the new\r\npan.\r\n\r\nThough we had been working all the while toward the shore, the\r\noffshore wind had driven us a hundred yards farther seaward. On closer\r\nexamination I found that the pan on which we were resting was not ice\r\nat all, but snow-covered slob, frozen into a mass which would\r\ncertainly eventually break up in the heavy sea, which was momentarily\r\nincreasing as the ice drove offshore before the wind. The westerly\r\nwind kept on rising--a bitter blast with us in winter, coming as it\r\ndoes over the Gulf ice.\r\n\r\nSome yards away I could still see my komatik with my thermos bottle\r\nand warm clothing on it, as well as matches and wood. In the memory of\r\nthe oldest inhabitant no one had ever been adrift on the ice in this\r\nbay, and unless the team which had gone ahead should happen to come\r\nback to look for me, there was not one chance in a thousand of my\r\nbeing seen.\r\n\r\nTo protect myself from freezing I now cut down my long boots as far as\r\nthe feet, and made a kind of jacket, which shielded my back from the\r\nrising wind.\r\n\r\nBy midday I had passed the island to which I had crossed on the ice\r\nbridge. The bridge was gone, so that if I did succeed in reaching\r\nthat island I should only be marooned there and die of starvation.\r\nFive miles away to the north side of the bay the immense pans of\r\nArctic ice were surging to and fro in the ground seas and thundering\r\nagainst the cliffs. No boat could have lived through such surf, even\r\nif I had been seen from that quarter. Though it was hardly, safe to\r\nmove about on my little pan, I saw that I must have the skins of some\r\nof my dogs, if I were to live the night out without freezing. With\r\nsome difficulty I now succeeded in killing three of my dogs--and I\r\nenvied those dead beasts whose troubles were over so quickly. I\r\nquestioned if, once I passed into the open sea, it would not be better\r\nto use my trusty knife on myself than to die by inches.\r\n\r\nBut the necessity for work saved me from undue philosophizing; and\r\nnight found me ten miles on my seaward voyage, with the three dogs\r\nskinned and their fur wrapped around me as a coat. I also frayed a\r\nsmall piece of rope into oakum and mixed it with the fat from the\r\nintestines of my dogs. But, alas, I found that the matches in my box,\r\nwhich was always chained to me, were soaked to a pulp and quite\r\nuseless. Had I been able to make a fire out there at sea, it would\r\nhave looked so uncanny that I felt sure that the fishermen friends,\r\nwhose tiny light I could just discern twinkling away in the bay, would\r\nsee it. The carcasses of my dogs I piled up to make a windbreak, and\r\nat intervals I took off my clothes, wrung them out, swung them in the\r\nwind, and put on first one and then the other inside, hoping that the\r\nheat of my body would thus dry them. My feet gave me the most trouble,\r\nas the moccasins were so easily soaked through in the snow. But I\r\nremembered the way in which the Lapps who tended our reindeer carried\r\ngrass with them, to use in their boots in place of dry socks. As soon\r\nas I could sit down I began to unravel the ropes from the dogs'\r\nharnesses, and although by this time my fingers were more or less\r\nfrozen, I managed to stuff the oakum into my shoes.\r\n\r\nShortly before I had opened a box containing some old football clothes\r\nwhich I had not seen for twenty years. I was wearing this costume at\r\nthe time; and though my cap, coat, and gloves were gone, as I stood\r\nthere in a pair of my old Oxford University running shorts, and red,\r\nyellow, and black Richmond football stockings, and a flannel shirt, I\r\nremembered involuntarily the little dying girl who asked to be dressed\r\nin her Sunday frock so that she might arrive in heaven properly\r\nattired.\r\n\r\nForcing my biggest dog to lie down, I cuddled up close to him, drew\r\nthe improvised dogskin rug over me, and proceeded to go to sleep. One\r\nhand being against the dog was warm, but the other was frozen, and\r\nabout midnight I woke up shivering enough, so I thought, to shatter my\r\nfrail pan to atoms. The moon was just rising, and the wind was\r\nsteadily driving me toward the open sea. Suddenly what seemed a\r\nmiracle happened, for the wind veered, then dropped away entirely\r\nleaving it flat calm. I turned over and fell asleep again. I was next\r\nawakened by the sudden and persistent thought that I must have a flag,\r\nand accordingly set to work to disarticulate the frozen legs of my\r\ndead dogs. Cold as it was I determined to sacrifice my shirt to top\r\nthis rude flagpole as soon as the daylight came. When the legs were at\r\nlast tied together with bits of old harness rope, they made the\r\ncrookedest flagstaff that it has ever been my lot to see. Though with\r\nthe rising of the sun the frost came out of the dogs' legs to some\r\nextent, and the friction of waving it made the odd pole almost tie\r\nitself in knots, I could raise it three or four feet above my head,\r\nwhich was very important.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice I thought that I could distinguish men against the\r\ndistant cliffs--for I had drifted out of the bay into the sea--but the\r\nobjects turned out to be trees. Once also I thought that I saw a boat\r\nappearing and disappearing on the surface of the water, but it proved\r\nto be only a small piece of ice bobbing up and down. The rocking of my\r\ncradle on the waves had helped me to sleep, and I felt as well as I\r\never did in my life. I was confident that I could last another\r\ntwenty-four hours if my boat would only hold out and not rot under the\r\nsun's rays. I could not help laughing at my position, standing hour\r\nafter hour waving my shirt at those barren and lonely cliffs; but I\r\ncan honestly say that from first to last not a single sensation of\r\nfear crossed my mind.\r\n\r\nMy own faith in the mystery of immortality is so untroubled that it\r\nnow seemed almost natural to be passing to the portal of death from an\r\nice-pan. Quite unbidden, the words of the old hymn kept running\r\nthrough my head:\r\n\r\n    \"My God, my Father, while I stray\r\n    Far from my home on life's rough way,\r\n    Oh, help me from my heart to say,\r\n      Thy will be done.\"\r\n\r\nI had laid my wooden matches out to dry and was searching about on the\r\npan for a piece of transparent ice which I could use as a\r\nburning-glass. I thought that I could make smoke enough to be seen\r\nfrom the land if only I could get some sort of a light. All at once I\r\nseemed to see the glitter of an oar, but I gave up the idea because I\r\nremembered that it was not water which lay between me and the land,\r\nbut slob ice, and even if people had seen me, I did not imagine that\r\nthey could force a boat through. The next time that I went back to my\r\nflag-waving, however, the glitter was very distinct, but my\r\nsnow-glasses having been lost, I was partially snow-blind and\r\ndistrusted my vision. But at last, besides the glide of an oar I made\r\nout the black streak of a boat's hull, and knew that if the pan held\r\nout for another hour I should be all right. The boat drew nearer and\r\nnearer, and I could make out my rescuers frantically waving. When they\r\ngot close by they shouted, \"Don't get excited. Keep on the pan where\r\nyou are.\" They were far more excited than I, and had they only known\r\nas I did the sensations of a bath in the icy water, without the chance\r\nof drying one's self afterwards, they would not have expected me to\r\nwish to follow the example of the Apostle Peter.\r\n\r\nAs the first man leaped on my pan and grasped my hand, not a word was\r\nspoken, but I could see the emotions which he was trying to force\r\nback. A swallow of the hot tea which had been thoughtfully sent out in\r\na bottle, the dogs hoisted on board, and we started for home, now\r\nforging along in open water, now pushing the pans apart with the oars,\r\nand now jumping out on the ice and hauling the boat over the pans.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the night before four men had been out on the headland\r\ncutting up some seals which they had killed in the fall. As they were\r\nleaving for home, my ice-raft must have drifted clear of Hare Island,\r\nand one of them, with his keen fisherman's eyes, had detected\r\nsomething unusual on the ice. They at once returned to their village,\r\nsaying that something living was adrift on the floe. The one man on\r\nthat section of coast who owned a good spy-glass jumped up from his\r\nsupper on hearing the news and hurried over to the lookout on the\r\ncliffs. Dusk though it was, he saw that a man was out on the ice, and\r\nnoticed him every now and again waving his hands at the shore. He\r\nimmediately surmised who it must be; so little as I thought it, when\r\nnight was closing in the men at the village were trying to launch a\r\nboat. Miles of ice lay between them and me, and the angry sea was\r\nhurling great blocks against the land. While I had considered myself a\r\nlaughing-stock, bowing with my flag at those unresponsive cliffs, many\r\neyes were watching me.\r\n\r\nBy daybreak a fine volunteer crew had been organized, and the boat,\r\nwith such a force behind it, would, I believe, have gone through\r\nanything. After seeing the heavy breakers through which we were\r\nguided, as at last we ran in at the harbour mouth, I knew well what\r\nthe wives of that crew had been thinking when they saw their loved\r\nones depart on such an errand.\r\n\r\nEvery soul in the village was waiting to shake hands as I landed; and\r\neven with the grip that one after another gave me, I did not find out\r\nthat my hands were badly frostburnt--a fact which I have realized\r\nsince, however. I must have looked a weird object as I stepped ashore,\r\ntied up in rags, stuffed out with oakum, and wrapped in the bloody\r\ndogskins.\r\n\r\nThe news had gone over to the hospital that I was lost, so I at once\r\nstarted north for St. Anthony, though I must confess that I did not\r\ngreatly enjoy the trip, as I had to be hauled like a log, my feet\r\nbeing so frozen that I could not walk. For a few days subsequently I\r\nhad painful reminders of the adventure in my frozen hands and feet,\r\nwhich forced me to keep to my bed--an unwelcome and unusual interlude\r\nin my way of life.\r\n\r\nIn our hallway stands a bronze tablet:\r\n\r\n    \"To the Memory of\r\n    Three Noble Dogs\r\n    Moody\r\n    Watch\r\n    Spy\r\n    Whose lives were given\r\n    For mine on the ice\r\n    April 21st, 1908.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy whose life I was intent on saving was brought to the hospital\r\na day or so later in a boat, the ice having cleared off the coast\r\ntemporarily; and he was soon on the highroad to recovery.\r\n\r\nWe all love life, and I was glad to have a new lease of it before me.\r\nAs I went to sleep that night there still rang through my ears the\r\nsame verse of the old hymn which had been my companion on the ice-pan:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, help me from my heart to say,\r\n    Thy will be done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHEY THAT DO BUSINESS IN GREAT WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary to her ungenerous reputation, even if vessels are lost on the\r\nLabrador, her almost unequalled series of harbours--so that from the\r\nStraits of Belle Isle to those of Hudson Bay there is not ten miles of\r\ncoast anywhere without one--enables the crew to escape nearly every\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, in the North Sea in October, a hurricane destroyed\r\ntwenty-five of our stout vessels on the Dogger Bank, cost us two\r\nhundred and seventy good lives, and left a hundred widows to mourn on\r\nthe land. In 1889 a storm hit the north coast of Newfoundland, but too\r\nlate in the season to injure much of the fishing fleet, which had for\r\nthe most part gone South. But it caused immense damage to property and\r\nthe loss of a few lives. As one of the testimonials to its fury, I saw\r\nthe flooring and seats of the church in the mud of the harbour at St.\r\nAnthony at low tide even though that church had been founded entirely\r\non a rock. We now concede that it is good economy on our coast to have\r\nwire stays to ringbolts leaded into rocky foundations, to anchor small\r\nbuildings. Our storms are mostly cyclones with wide vortices, and\r\ncoming largely from the southwest or northwest, are offshore, and\r\ntherefore less felt.\r\n\r\nWe were once running along at full speed in a very thick fog, framing\r\na course to just clear some nasty shoals on our port bow. There was\r\nnothing outside us and we had seen no ice of late, so I went below for\r\nsome lunch, telling the mate to report land as soon as he saw any, and\r\ninstructing the man at the wheel, if he heard a shout, to port his\r\nhelm hard. The soup was still on the table when a loud shouting made\r\nus leap on the deck to see the ship going full tilt into an enormous\r\niceberg, which seemed right at the end of the bowsprit. This\r\nunexpected monster was on our starboard bow, and the order to avoid\r\nthe shoal was putting us headfirst into it. Our only chance was full\r\nspeed and a starboard helm, and we actually grazed along the side of\r\nthe berg. It seemed almost ludicrous later to pick up a large island\r\nand run into a harbour with grassy, sloping sides, out of which the\r\nfog was shut like a wall, and then to go ashore and bargain over\r\nbuying a couple of cows, which were being sold, as the settler was\r\nmoving to the mainland.\r\n\r\nAmong the records of events of importance to us I find in 1908 that of\r\nthe second real hurricane which I have ever seen. It began on\r\nSaturday, July 28, the height of our summer, with flat calm and\r\nsunshine alternating with small, fierce squalls. Though we had a\r\nfalling barometer, this deceived us, and we anchored that evening in a\r\nshallow and unsafe open roadstead about twenty miles from Indian\r\nHarbour Hospital. Fortunately our suspicions induced us to keep an\r\nanchor watch, and his warning made us get steam at midnight, and we\r\nbrought up at daylight in the excellent narrow harbour in which the\r\nhospital stands. The holding ground there is deep mud in four fathoms\r\nof water, the best possible for us. Our only trouble was that the\r\nheavy tidal current would swing a ship uneasily broadside against an\r\naverage wind force.\r\n\r\nIt was blowing so strongly by this time that the hospital yawl Daryl\r\nhad already been driven ashore from her anchors, but still we were\r\nable to keep ours in the water, and getting a line to her, to heave\r\nher astern of our vessel with our powerful winch. The fury of the\r\nbreeze grew worse as the day went on. All the fishing boats in the\r\nharbour filled and sank with the driving water. With the increase of\r\nviolence of the weather we got up steam and steamed to our anchors to\r\nease if possible the strain on our two chains and shore lines--a web\r\nwhich we had been able to weave before it was too late. By Sunday the\r\ngale had blown itself entirely away, and Monday morning broke flat\r\ncalm, with lovely sunshine, and only an enormous sullen ground sea.\r\nThis is no uncommon game of Dame Nature's; she seemed to be only\r\nmocking at the destruction which she had wrought.\r\n\r\nKnowing that there must be many comrades in trouble, we were early\r\naway, and dancing like a bubble, we ran north, keeping as close\r\ninshore as we could, and watching the coast-line with our glasses. The\r\ncoast was littered with remains. Forty-one vessels had been lost; in\r\none uninhabited roadstead alone, some forty miles away from Indian\r\nHarbour, lay sixteen wrecks. The shore here was lined with rude\r\nshelters made from the wreckage of spars and sails, and the women were\r\nbusy cooking meals and \"tidying up\" the shacks as if they had lived\r\nthere always.\r\n\r\nWe soon set to work hauling off such vessels as would float. One, a\r\nlarge hardwood, well-fastened hull, we determined to save. Her name\r\nwas Pendragon. The owner was aboard--a young man with no experience\r\nwho had never previously owned a vessel. He was so appalled at the\r\ndisaster that he decided to have her sold piecemeal and broken up. We\r\nattended the auction on the beach and bought each piece as it came to\r\nthe hammer. Getting her off was the trouble. We adopted tactics of our\r\nown invention. Mousing together the two mastheads with a bight of\r\nrope, we put on it a large whoop traveller, and to that fastened our\r\nstoutest and longest line. Then first backing down to her on the very\r\ntop of high water, we went \"full speed ahead.\" Over she fell on her\r\nside and bumped along on the mud and shingle for a few yards. By\r\nrepeated jerks she was eventually ours, but leaking so like a basket\r\nthat we feared we should yet lose her. Pumps inside fortunately kept\r\nher free till we passed her topsail under her, and after dropping in\r\nsods and peat, we let the pressure from the outside keep them in\r\nplace. When night fell I was played out, and told the crew they must\r\nlet her sink. My two volunteer helpers, Albert Gould, of Bowdoin, and\r\nPaul Matheson, of Brown, however, volunteered to pump all night.\r\n\r\nWhile hunting for a crew to take her South we came upon the wreck of a\r\nbrand-new boat, only launched two months previously. She had been the\r\npride of the skipper's life. He was an old friend of mine, and we felt\r\nso sorry for him that we not only got him to take our vessel, but we\r\nhanded it over for him to work out at the cost which we had paid for\r\nthe pieces. He made a good living out of her for several years, but\r\nlater she was lost with all hands on some dangerous shoals near St.\r\nAnthony on a journey North.\r\n\r\nWith fifty-odd people aboard, and a long trail of nineteen fishing\r\nboats we eventually got back to Indian Harbour, where every one joined\r\nin helping our friends in misfortune till the steamer came and took\r\nthem South. They waved us farewell, and, quite undismayed, wished for\r\nbetter luck for themselves another season.\r\n\r\nThe case of one skipper is well worth relating as showing their\r\nadmirable optimism. He was sixty-seven years old, and had by hard\r\nsaving earned his own schooner--a fine large vessel. He had arranged\r\nto sell her on his return trip and live quietly on the proceeds on his\r\npotato patch in southern Newfoundland. His vessel had driven on a\r\nsubmerged reef and turned turtle. The crew had jumped for their lives,\r\nnot even saving their personal clothing, watches, or instruments. We\r\nphotographed the remains of the capsized hull floating on the surf.\r\nYet this man, in the four days during which he was my guest, never\r\nonce uttered a word of complaint. He had done all he could, and he\r\n\"'lowed that t' Lord knew better than he what was best.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do now, Skipper?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, get another,\" he replied; \"I think them'll trust me.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our older vessels started a plank in a gale of wind in the\r\nAtlantic and went to the bottom without warning. In an open boat for\r\nsix days with only a little dry bread and no covering of any sort, the\r\ncrew fought rough seas and heavy breezes. But they handled her with\r\nthe sea genius of our race; made land safely at last, and never said a\r\nword about the incident. On another occasion two men, who had been a\r\nfortnight adrift, had rowed one hundred and fifty miles, and had only\r\nthe smallest modicum of food, came aboard our vessel. When I said,\r\n\"You are hungry, aren't you?\" they merely replied, \"Well, not\r\nover-much\"--and only laughed when I suggested that perhaps a month in\r\nthe open boat might have given them a real appetite.\r\n\r\nOne October, south of St. Anthony, we were lying in the arm of a bay\r\nwith two anchors and two warps out, one to each side of the narrow\r\nchannel. The wind piled up the waters, much as it did in Pharaoh's\r\nday. We were flung astern yard by yard on the top of the seas, and\r\nwhen it was obvious that we must go ashore, we reversed our engines,\r\nslipped our line, and drove up high and dry to escape the bumping on\r\nthe beach which was inevitable. There we lay for days. Meanwhile I had\r\ntaken our launch into the river-mouth and was marooned there. For the\r\nlaunch blew right up on the bank in among the trees, and strive as we\r\nwould, for days we could not even move her out again.\r\n\r\nAnother spring we had a very close squeak of losing the Strathcona.\r\nWhile we were trying one morning to get out of a harbour, a sudden\r\ngale of wind came down upon us and pinned us tight, so that we could\r\nnot move an inch. The pressure of the ice became more severe moment by\r\nmoment, and meanwhile the ice between us and the shore seemed to be\r\nimperceptibly melting away. Naturally we tried every expedient we\r\ncould think of to keep enough ice between us and the shore rocks to\r\nsave the vessel being swept over the rocky headland, toward which the\r\nirresistible tidal current was steadily forcing us. To make matters\r\nworse, we struck our propeller against a pan of ice and broke off one\r\nof the flanges close to the shaft. It became breathlessly exciting as\r\nthe ship drew nearer and nearer to the rocks. We abandoned our boat\r\nwhen we saw that by trying to hold on to it any longer we should be\r\njeopardizing the steamer. Twisting round helplessly as in a giant's\r\narms, we were swept past the dangerous promontory and to our infinite\r\njoy carried out into the open Atlantic where there is room for all.\r\nOur boat was subsequently rescued from the shore, and we were able to\r\nscrew on a new blade to the propeller.\r\n\r\nJust after the big gale in 1908 His Excellency, Sir William MacGregor,\r\nthen Governor, was good enough to come and spend a short time\r\nsurveying on our north coast. He was an expert in this line, as well\r\nas being a gold-medallist in medicine. Later he changed over from the\r\nStrathcona to the Government steamer Fiona. I acted as pilot among\r\nother capacities on that journey, and was unlucky enough to run her\r\nfull tilt onto one of the only sandbanks on the coast in a narrow\r\npassage between some islands and the mainland! The little\r\nStrathcona, following behind, was in time to haul us off again, but\r\nthe incident made the captain naturally distrust my ability, and as a\r\nresult he would not approach the shore near enough for us to get the\r\nobservations which we needed. Although we went round Cape Chidley into\r\nUngava Bay I could not regain his confidence sufficiently to go\r\nthrough the straits which I had myself sounded and surveyed. So we\r\naccomplished it in a small boat, getting good observations. Our best\r\nwork, however, was done when His Excellency was content to be our\r\nguest. The hospital on board was used for the necessary\r\ninstruments--four chronometers, two theodolites, guns, telescopes,\r\ncamp furniture, and piles of books and printed forms. Mr. Albert Gould\r\nof Bowdoin was my secretary on board that year, and was of very great\r\nvalue to us.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ICEBERGS]\r\n\r\nThough the work of an amateur, Sir William's surveying was accepted by\r\nthe Admiralty and the Royal Geographical Society--his survey in\r\nNigeria having proved to have not one single location a mile out of\r\nplace when an official survey was run later.\r\n\r\nMany a time in the middle of a meal, some desired but unlucky star\r\nwould cross the prime vertical, and all hands had to go up on deck and\r\nshiver while rows of figures were accumulated. Sir William told us\r\nthat he would rather shoot a star any time than all the game ever\r\nhunted. One night my secretary, after sitting on a rock at a movable\r\ntable from 5 P.M. till midnight, came in, his joints almost creaking\r\nwith cold, and loaded with a pile of figures which he assured us would\r\ncrush the life out of most men. My mate that year was a stout and very\r\nshort, plethoric person. When he stated that he preferred surveying to\r\nfishing, as it was going to benefit others so much, and that he was\r\nfamiliar with the joys of service, he was taken promptly at his word.\r\nIt was a hot summer. The theodolite was a nine-inch one and weighed\r\nmany pounds. We had climbed the face of a very steep mountain called\r\nCape Mugford, some three thousand feet high--every inch of which\r\ndistance we had to mount from dead sea-level. When at last Israel\r\narrived on the summit, he looked worried. He said that he had always\r\nthought surveying meant letting things drop down over the ship's side,\r\nand not carrying ballast up precipices. For his part he could now see\r\nthat providing food for the world was good enough for him. He\r\ndistinctly failed to grasp where the joy of this kind of service came\r\nin--and noting his condition as he lay on the ground and panted I\r\ndecided to let it go at that.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was a real MacGregor and a Presbyterian, and was\r\ntherefore quite a believer in keeping Sunday as a day of rest. But\r\nafter morning prayers on the first fine day, after nearly a week of\r\nfog, he decided that he had had physical rest enough, and to get good\r\nobservations would bring him the recreation of spirit which he most\r\nneeded. So he packed up for work, and happened to light on the unhappy\r\nIsrael to row him a mile or so to the land. \"Iz\" was taken \"all\r\naback.\" He believed that you should not strain yourself ever--much\r\nless on Sundays. So from religious scruples he asked to be excused,\r\nthough he offered to row any one ashore if he was only going to idle\r\nthe hours away. After all, however, our Governor represented our King,\r\nand I was personally horrified, intending to correct Israel's position\r\nwith a round turn, and show him that we are especially enjoined to\r\nobey \"Governors and Rulers\"--as better also than the sacrifice of\r\nloafing. But the Governor forbade it, quietly unpacked, put his things\r\naway, and stayed aboard. Israel subsequently cultivated the habit of\r\nremaining in bed on Sundays--thereby escaping being led into\r\ntemptation, as even Governors would not be likely to go and tempt him\r\nin his bunk.\r\n\r\nI have had others refuse to help in really necessary work on Sunday.\r\nOne skipper would not get the Strathcona under way in answer to a\r\nwireless appeal to come to a woman in danger of dying from hemorrhage\r\nforty miles distant. When we prepared to start without him, he told me\r\nthat he would go, but that it would be at the price of his soul and we\r\nwould have to be responsible for that loss. We went all the same.\r\n\r\nOur charts, such as they were, were subsequently accepted by the Royal\r\nGeographical Society of England, who generously invited me to lecture\r\nbefore them. They were later good enough to award me the Murchison\r\nPrize in 1911. Much of the work was really due to Sir William, and as\r\nmuch of it as I could put on him to the Sabbatarian \"Iz.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the scientific work on the coast I well remember\r\nthe eclipse of October, 1905. All along the land it was perfectly\r\nvisible. A break in the clouds occurred at exactly the right moment:\r\none fisherman, to console the astronomers, said that he was very\r\nsorry, but that he supposed it did not much matter, as there would be\r\nanother eclipse next week. The scientific explorer, who was devoting\r\nhis attention to the effect on the earth's magnetism, spent the time\r\nof the eclipse in a dark cellar. Most wonderful magnetic disturbances\r\nhad been occurring almost every night, and the night before the event\r\na far from ordinary storm had upset his instruments, so that the\r\neffect of the eclipse on the magnetic indicators was scarcely\r\ndistinguishable. He had just time after the thing was over to peep out\r\nand see the light returning. He had watched his thermometer and found\r\nthat it fell three degrees during totality.\r\n\r\nThe year 1908 at the mill we had built a new large schooner in honour\r\nof that devoted friend of Labrador, our secretary in Boston, and had\r\nnamed the vessel for her, the Emma E. White. She fetched Lloyd's full\r\nbounty for an A 1 ship. This was a feather in our caps, since she was\r\ndesigned and built by one of our own men, who was no \"scholard,\"\r\nhaving never learned to read or write. Will Hopkins can take an axe\r\nand a few tools into the green woods in the fall, and sail down the\r\nbay in a new schooner in the spring when the ice goes. To see him\r\nsteaming the planking in the open in his own improvised boxes on the\r\ntop of six feet of snow made me stand and take off my hat to him. He\r\nis no good at speech-making; he does not own a dress-suit, and he\r\ncannot dance a tango; but he is quite as useful a citizen as some who\r\ncan, and his type of education is one which endears him to all. He\r\ngave me the great pleasure of having our friend come sailing into St.\r\nAnthony in the middle of a fine day, seated on the bow of her\r\nnamesake, the beautiful and valuable product of his skill, just when\r\nwe were all ready on the wharf to \"sketch them both off,\" as our\r\npeople call taking a photograph.\r\n\r\nOur increasing buildings being all of wood, and as the two largest\r\nwere full of either helpless sick people or an ever-increasing batch\r\nof children, we wanted something safer than kerosene lamps to\r\nilluminate the rooms. The people here had never seen electric light\r\n\"tamed,\" as it were, and to us it seemed almost too big a venture to\r\ninstall a plant of our own. Home outfits were not common in those days\r\neven in the States, and we feared in any case that we could not run it\r\nregularly enough. No one except the head of the machine shop, a\r\nLabrador boy and Pratt graduate, knew the first thing about\r\nelectricity, and he would not always be available.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the help of friends we were able to purchase a hot-head\r\nvertical engine to generate our current; for our near-by streams\r\nfreeze solid in winter. That engine has now been running for over ten\r\nyears, and has given us electricity in St. Anthony Hospital for\r\noperating and X-ray work as well as all our lighting. Until he died,\r\nit was run the greater part of the time by an Eskimo boy whom we had\r\nbrought down from the North Labrador, and who was convalescing from\r\nempyema. The installation was efficiently done by a volunteer student\r\nfrom the Pratt Institute, Mr. Hause.\r\n\r\nOn my lecture trip the previous winter a gentleman at whose house I\r\nwas a guest told me that when quite a youth he had fought in the Civil\r\nWar, been invalided home, and advised to take a sea voyage for his\r\nhealth. He therefore took passage with some Gloucester fishermen and\r\nset sail for the Labrador. The crew proved to be Southern\r\nsympathizers, and one day, while my friend was ashore taking a walk,\r\nthe skipper slipped out and left him marooned. He had with him neither\r\nmoney, spare clothing, nor anything else; and as British sympathies\r\nwere also with the South, he had many doubts as to how the settlers\r\nwould receive a penniless stranger and Northerner. So seeing his\r\nschooner bound in an easterly direction, he started literally to run\r\nalong the shore, hoping that he might find where she went and catch\r\nher again. Mile after mile he went, tearing through the \"tuckamore\" or\r\ndense undergrowth of gnarled trees, climbing over high cliffs,\r\nswimming or wading the innumerable rivers, skirting bays, and now and\r\nagain finding a short beach along which he could hurry. At night, wet,\r\ndirty, tired, hungry, penniless, he came to a fisherman's cottage and\r\nasked shelter and food. He explained that he was an American gentleman\r\ntaking a holiday, but hadn't a penny of money. It spoke well for the\r\npeople that they accepted his story. He told me that they both fed and\r\nclothed him, and one kind-hearted man actually the next day gave him\r\nsome oilskin clothing and a sou'wester hat--costly articles \"on\r\nLabrador\" in those days. So on and on and on he went, till at last\r\narriving at Red Bay he found his schooner at anchor calmly fishing. He\r\nwent aboard at once as if nothing had happened, and stayed there\r\n(having enjoyed enough pedestrian exercise for the time being) and no\r\none ever referred to his having been left behind. He was now, however,\r\nforty years later, anxious to do something for the people of that\r\nsection of the shore, and he gave me a thousand dollars toward\r\nbuilding a small cottage for a district nurse. Forteau was the village\r\nchosen, and Dennison Cottage erected as a nursing station and\r\ndispensary. The people at first each gave a week toward its upkeep;\r\nand even now every man gives three days annually. The house has a good\r\ngarden, little wards for in-patients, and is the centre of much useful\r\nindustrial work, especially the making of artificial flowers. For\r\ntwelve years now, Miss Florence Bailey, a nurse from the Mildmay\r\nInstitute in London, has presided over its destinies, endeared herself\r\nto the people, and done most unselfish and heroic work in that lonely\r\nstation, which she has greatly enlarged and improved by her untiring\r\nefforts. It forms an admirable halfway house between Battle and\r\nHarrington Hospitals, each being about a hundred miles distant. A\r\nlocal trader once wrote me: \"Sister Bailey did good work last year.\r\nThat cottage hospital is a blessing to the people of this part of the\r\nshore. Who would think that by a little act of kindness done forty-odd\r\nyears ago to an old soldier, we would now be reaping the benefit of\r\nsuch an act.\"\r\n\r\nOnly one longer journey on foot on the Labrador coast is on record.\r\nThe traveller started from Quebec and walked to Battle Harbour. There\r\nhe turned north and walked to Nakvak Bay. The distance as the crow\r\nflies is about fourteen hundred miles. But the man had no boat of his\r\nown and only in one or two places accepted a passage. One bay on the\r\neast coast runs in for some hundred and fifty miles. Over this he got\r\na boat fifty miles from the mouth. Round Kipokak and Makkovik, and the\r\nbays south of Hopedale, he walked most of the way, and these run in\r\nfor forty miles. He carried practically nothing with him, and depended\r\non what boots and clothing the people gave him, eating berries and\r\nwhatever else he could find while he was in the country. Those who\r\nhoused him told me that they did not see any signs of madness about\r\nhim, except his avoidance of men and refusal to go in boats or mix\r\nwith others if he could in any way avoid it. He carried no gun. No one\r\nknew who he was nor why he went on such a \"cruise.\" Long before he\r\nreached the North the theory that he was a murderer fleeing from\r\njustice got started, and at some places a very careful watch was kept\r\nover him. Arrived at Nakvak, he went to the house of everyone's\r\nfriend, George Ford. That is one of the most inaccessible places in\r\nthe world. No mail steamer ever goes there, and no schooner ever\r\nanchors nearer than a few miles. It is at the bottom of a fjord\r\ntwenty-five miles long, with very precipitous cliffs two thousand feet\r\nhigh on each side and bottomless water below. It was then thirty miles\r\nfrom the nearest house, with ranges of mountains between, and was the\r\nmost northerly house on the Labrador. Here this phenomenon celebrated\r\nhis arrival by climbing up onto the ridge of the house, when lo! most\r\nprosaic of accidents, he fell off and broke his neck. The puzzle has\r\nalways been why he elected to carry an unbroken neck at such cost all\r\nthat long distance.\r\n\r\nMany inexplicable things happen \"on Labrador.\" Thus, one year while\r\nvisiting at the head of Hamilton Inlet, a Scotch settler came aboard\r\nto ask my advice about a large animal that had appeared round his\r\nhouse. Though he had sat up night after night with his gun, he had\r\nnever seen it. His children had seen it several times disappearing\r\ninto the trees. The French agent of Révillon Frères, twenty miles\r\naway, had come over, and together they had tracked it, measured the\r\nfootmarks in the mud, and even fenced some of them round. The stride\r\nwas about eight feet, the marks as of the cloven hoofs of an ox. The\r\nchildren described the creature as looking like a huge hairy man; and\r\nseveral nights the dogs had been driven growling from the house into\r\nthe water. Twice the whole family had heard the creature prowling\r\naround the cottage, and tapping at the doors and windows. The now\r\ngrown-up children persist in saying that they saw this wild thing.\r\nTheir house is twenty miles up the large Grand River, and a hundred\r\nand fifty miles from the coast.\r\n\r\nAn old fellow called Harry Howell was one winter night missing from\r\nhis home. He had been hunting, and only too late, after a blizzard set\r\nin, was it discovered that he was absent. In the morning the men\r\ngathered to make a search, but at that moment in walked \"old Harry\"!\r\nHe told me later that he was coming home in the afternoon when the\r\nblizzard began. It was dirty, thick of snow, and cold. Suddenly he\r\nheard bells ringing, and knew that it was fairies bidding him follow\r\nthem--because he had followed them before. So off he went, pushing his\r\nway through the driving snow. When at last he reached the foot of a\r\ngnarled old tree in the forest, the bells stopped, and he knew that\r\nwas the place where he must stay for the night. So he laid some of the\r\npartridges which he had killed into a hole in the snow close to the\r\ntrunk, crawled down and used them for a seat, and placed the rest of\r\nthe frozen birds at his feet. Then he pulled up his dickey, or kossak,\r\nover his head, and with his back to the tree, went to sleep while the\r\nsnow was still driving. There was no persuading that man that the\r\nringing bells were in his own imagination.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a Norwegian captain on the Labrador told me the\r\nfollowing story. One day the carpenter of his schooner, a man whom he\r\nhad known for three voyages, and trusted thoroughly, was steering on\r\nthe course which the mate had given him. All at once the mate came and\r\nfound the man steering four points out. When he upbraided him, he\r\nanswered, \"He came and told me to.\" \"Nobody did,\" replied the mate.\r\n\"Go northwest.\"\r\n\r\nThree times the experience was repeated, and at last the mate reported\r\nthe matter to the skipper. He immediately suggested, \"Well, let us go\r\non running in the direction he insists on taking for a while and see\r\nif anything happens.\" At the end of two hours they came upon a\r\nsquare-rigger with her decks just awash, and six men clinging to her\r\nrigging. As they came alongside the sinking vessel the carpenter\r\npointed aghast to one of the rescued crew and cried out, \"There's the\r\nman who came and told me the skipper said to change the course.\"\r\n\r\nIn medicine, too, things happen which we professional men are just as\r\nunable to explain. A big-bodied, successful fisherman came aboard my\r\nsteamer one day, saying that he had toothache. This was probable, for\r\nhis jaw was swollen, his mouth hard to open, and the offending molar\r\neasily visible within. When I produced the forceps he protested most\r\nloudly that he would not have it touched for worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, did you come to me?\" I asked. \"You are wasting my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted you to charm her, Doctor,\" he answered, quite naturally.\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear friend, I do not know how to charm, and don't think it\r\nwould do the slightest good. Doctors are not allowed to do such\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently very much put out, and turning round to go, said, \"I\r\nknows why you'se won't charm her. It's because I'm a Roman Catholic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. If you really think that it would do any good, come along.\r\nYou'll have to pay twenty-five cents exactly as if you had it pulled\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly enough, Doctor. Please go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat on the rail, a burly carcass, the incarnation of materialism,\r\nwhile the doctor, feeling the size of a sandflea, put one finger into\r\nhis mouth and touched the molar, while he repeated the most mystic\r\nnonsense he could think of, \"Abracadabra Tiddlywinkum Umslopoga\"--and\r\nthen jumped the finger out lest the patient might close his ponderous\r\njaw. The fisherman took a turn around the deck, pulled out the\r\nquarter, and solemnly handed it to me, saying, \"All the pain has gone.\r\nMany thanks, Doctor.\" I found myself standing alone in amazement,\r\ntwiddling a miserable shilling, and wondering how I came to make such\r\na fool of myself.\r\n\r\nA month later the patient again came to see me when we happened to be\r\nin his harbour. The swelling had gone, the molar was there. \"Ne'er an\r\nache out of her since,\" the patient laughed. I have not reported this\r\nend result to the committee of the American College of Surgeons,\r\nthough much attention is now devoted to the follow-up and end-result\r\ndepartment of surgery and medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the fall of 1908, and the time had come for me to visit\r\nEngland again and try and arouse fresh interest in our work; and this\r\nmotive was combined with the desire to see my old mother, who was now\r\nnearing her fourscore years. I decided to leave in November and return\r\n_via_ America in the spring to receive the honorary degree of LL.D.\r\nfrom Williams College and of M.A. from Harvard, which I had been\r\ngenerously offered.\r\n\r\nMy lecture tour this winter was entrusted to an agency. Propaganda is\r\na recognized necessity in human life, though it has little attraction\r\nfor most men. To me having to ask personally for money even for other\r\npeople was always a difficulty. Scores of times I have been blamed for\r\nnot even stating in a lecture that we needed help. The distaste for\r\nbeating the big drum, which lecturing for your own work always appears\r\nto be, makes me quite unable to see any virtue in not doing it, but\r\njust asking the Lord to do it. If I really were convinced that He\r\nwould meet the expenses whether I worked or not, I should believe that\r\nneither would He let people suffer and die untended out here or\r\nanywhere else. Indeed, it would seem a work of supererogation to have\r\nto remind Him of the necessity that existed.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we have to show pictures of the work which we are doing\r\nis tiresome and takes time, but it encourages us to have pictures\r\nworth taking and to do deeds which we are not ashamed to narrate. It\r\nalso stimulates others to give themselves as well as their money to\r\nsimilar kinds of work at their own doorsteps, to see how much like\r\nthemselves their almoners are. Only to-day my volunteer secretary told\r\nme that he honestly expected to meet \"a bearded old fogey in\r\nspectacles,\" not a man who can shoot his own dinner from the wing or\r\nwho enjoys the justifiable pleasures of life.\r\n\r\nThe religion of Christ never permitted me to accept the idea that\r\nthere is \"nothing to do, only believe.\" Every man ought to earn his\r\nown bread and the means to support his family. Why, then, should you\r\nhave only to ask the Lord to give unasked the wherewithal to feed\r\nother people's families?\r\n\r\nLecturing for philanthropies, only another word for the means to help\r\nalong the Kingdom of God on earth, is in England usually carried on\r\nthrough the ordinary missionary meetings; and in my previous\r\nexperience they were not generally much credit to the splendid objects\r\nin view. The lectures were often patronized by small audiences largely\r\ncomposed of women and children.\r\n\r\nThat particular winter in England I had the privilege of addressing\r\nall sorts of workmen's clubs and city lecture-course audiences, people\r\nwho would have \"the shivers\" almost if one had asked them to attend a\r\n\"missionary\" lecture. The collection, or even the final monetary\r\noutcome, is far from being the test of the value of the address. To\r\ncommend Christ's religion by minimizing in any way the prerogative He\r\ngave men of carrying on the work of His kingdom in their human efforts\r\nis to sap the very appeal that attracts manhood to Him. I never wanted\r\nto sing, \"Oh! to be nothing, nothing.\" I always wished to sing, \"Oh!\r\nmake me something, something\"--that shall leave some footprints on the\r\nsands of time, and have some record of talents gained to offer a\r\nMaster whom we believe to be righteous.\r\n\r\nWhen spring came and the lectures were over, a new idea suddenly\r\ndawned upon me. If I were going to America to festive gatherings and\r\nto have some honours conferred, why leave the mother behind?\r\nSeventy-eight years is not old. She was born in India, had lived in\r\nEngland, and suppose anything did happen, why not sleep in\r\nAmerica?--she would be just as near God there. The splendid Mauretania\r\nnot only took us safely over, but gave me also that gift which I\r\nfirmly believe God designed for me--a real partner to share in my joys\r\nand sorrows, to encourage and support in trouble and failures, to\r\ninspire and advise in a thousand ways, and in addition to bring into\r\nmy distant field of work a personal comrade with the culture, wisdom,\r\nand enthusiasm of the American life and the training of one of the\r\nvery best of its Universities.\r\n\r\nWe met on board the second day out. She was travelling with a Scotch\r\nbanker of Chicago and his wife, Mr. W.R. Stirling, whose daughter was\r\nher best friend. They were returning from a motor tour through Europe\r\nand Algeria. The Mauretania takes only four and a half days in\r\ncrossing, and never before did I realize the drawbacks of \"hustle,\"\r\nand yet the extreme need of it on my part. The degrees of longitude\r\nslipped by so quickly that I felt personally aggrieved when one day we\r\nmade over six hundred miles, and the captain told us in triumph that\r\nit was a new record. The ship seemed to be paying off some spite\r\nagainst me. My mother kept mostly to her cabin. Though constantly in\r\nto see her, I am afraid I did not unduly worry her to join me on the\r\ndeck. When just on landing I told her that I had asked a fellow\r\npassenger to become my wife, I am sure had the opportunity arisen she\r\nwould have tumbled down the Mauretania's staircase. When she had the\r\njoy of meeting the girl, her equanimity was so far upset as to let an\r\nunaccustomed tear roll down her cheek. That, at least, is one of the\r\ntears which I have cost her which brings no regrets. For she confesses\r\nthat it often puzzles her to which of our lives the event has meant\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nThe constant little activities of my life had so filled every hour of\r\ntime, and so engrossed my thoughts, that I had never thought to\r\nphilosophize on the advisability of marriage, nor stopped to compare\r\nmy life with those of my neighbors. There is no virtue in keeping the\r\nNinth Commandment and not envying your neighbour's condition or goods\r\nwhen it never enters your head or heart to worry about them; and when\r\nyou are getting what you care about no halo is due you for not falling\r\nvictim to envy or jealousy of others. I have not been in the habit of\r\npraying for special personal providences like fine weather in my\r\nsection of the earth, or for head wind for the schooners so as to give\r\nme a fair wind for my steamer, except so far as one prays for the\r\nrecognition of God's good hand in everything.\r\n\r\nI can honestly protest that nothing in my life ever came more \"out of\r\nthe blue\" than my marriage; and beyond that I am increasingly certain\r\neach day that it did come out of that blue where God dwells.\r\n\r\nI knew neither whence she came nor whither she was going. Indeed, I\r\nonly found out when the proposition was really put that I did not even\r\nknow her name--for it was down on the passenger list as one of the\r\ndaughters of the friends with whom she was travelling. Fortunately it\r\nnever entered my head that it mattered. For I doubt if I should have\r\nhad the courage to question the chaperon, whose daughter she\r\npresumably was. It certainly was a \"poser\" to be told, \"But you don't\r\neven know my name.\" Had I not been a bit of a seaman, and often\r\ncompelled on the spur of the moment to act first and think\r\nafterwards, what the consequences might have been I cannot say.\r\nFortunately, I remembered that it was not the matter at issue, and\r\nexplained, without admitting the impeachment, that the only question\r\nthat interested me in the least was what I hoped that it might become.\r\nIncidentally she mentioned that she had only once heard of me. It was\r\nthe year previous when I had been speaking at Bryn Mawr and she had\r\nrefused in no measured terms an invitation to attend, as sounding\r\nentirely too dull for her predilections. I have wondered whether this\r\nwas not another \"small providence.\"\r\n\r\nA pathological condition of one's internal workings is not unusual\r\neven in Britons who \"go down to the sea in ships,\" but such genius as\r\nour family has displayed has, so history assures us, shone best on a\r\nquarter-deck; and on this occasion it pleased God ultimately to add\r\nanother naval victory to our credit. It is generally admitted that an\r\nabnormal mentality accompanies this not uncommon experience of human\r\nlife, and I found my lack of appreciation of the rapid voyage\r\nparalleled by a wicked satisfaction that my mother preferred the brass\r\nfour-poster, so thoughtfully provided for her by the Cunard Company,\r\nto the risks of the unsteady promenade deck.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl's way and mine parted in that last word in material\r\njostlings, the custom-house shed in Manhattan, after the liner\r\narrived, I realized that it was rather an armistice than a permanent\r\nsettlement which I had achieved. Though there was no father in the\r\ncase, I learned that there was a mother and a home in Chicago. These\r\nwere formidable strongholds for a homeless wanderer to assault, but\r\nrendered doubly so by the fact that there was neither brother nor\r\nsister to leave behind to mitigate the possible vacancy. The\r\n\"everlasting yea\" not having been forthcoming, under the\r\ncircumstances it was no easy task for me to keep faith with the many\r\nappointments to lecture on Labrador which had been made for me. The\r\ninexorable schedule kept me week after week in the East. Fortunately\r\nthe generous hospitality of many old friends who wanted the pleasure\r\nof meeting my mother kept my mind somewhat occupied. But I confess at\r\nthe back of it the forthcoming venture loomed up more and more\r\nmomentous as the fateful day drew near for me to start for Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis visit to my wife's beautiful country home among the trees on the\r\nbluff of Lake Michigan in Lake Forest was one long dream. My mother\r\nand I were now made acquainted with the family and friends of my\r\nfiancée. Her father, Colonel MacClanahan, a man of six feet five\r\ninches in height, had been Judge Advocate General on the Staff of\r\nBraxton Bragg and had fought under General Robert E. Lee. He was a\r\nSoutherner of Scotch extraction, having been born and brought up in\r\nTennessee. A lawyer by training, after the war, when everything that\r\nbelonged to him was destroyed in the \"reconstruction period,\" and\r\nbeing still a very young man, he had gone North to Chicago and begun\r\nlife again at his profession. There he met and married, in 1884, Miss\r\nRosamond Hill, who was born in Burlington, Vermont, but who, since\r\nchildhood and the death of her parents, had lived with her married\r\nsister, Mrs. Charles Durand, of Chicago. The MacClanahans had two\r\nchildren--the boy, Kinloch, dying at an early age as the result of an\r\naccident. Colonel MacClanahan himself died a few months later, leaving\r\na widow and one child, Anna Elizabeth Caldwell MacClanahan. She and\r\nher mother had lived the greater part of the time with Mrs. Durand,\r\nwho died something more than a year before our engagement.\r\n\r\nThe friends with whom my fiancée had been travelling were almost\r\nnext-door neighbours in Lake Forest. They made my short stay doubly\r\nhappy by endless kindnesses; and all through the years, till his death\r\nin 1918, Mr. Stirling gave me not only a friendship which meant more\r\nto me than I can express, but his loving and invaluable aid and\r\ncounsel in our work.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my many years of sailor life, I found that I was expected\r\namong other things to ride a horse, my fiancée being devoted to that\r\nmeans of progression. The days when I had ridden to hounds in England\r\nas a boy in Cheshire stood me in some little stead, for like swimming,\r\ntennis, and other pastimes calling for coördination, riding is never\r\nquite forgotten. But remembering Mr. Winkle's experiences, it was not\r\nwithout some misgivings that I found a shellback like myself galloping\r\nbehind my lady's charger. My last essay at horseback riding had been\r\njust eleven years previously in Iceland. Having to wait a few days at\r\nReikkavik, I had hired a whole bevy of ponies with a guide to take\r\nmyself and the young skipper of our vessel for a three days' ride to\r\nsee the geysers. He had never been on the back of any animal before,\r\nand was nevertheless not surprised or daunted at falling off\r\nfrequently, though an interlude of being dragged along with one foot\r\nin the stirrup over lava beds made no little impression upon him.\r\nFodder of all kinds is very scarce in the volcanic tufa of which all\r\nthat land consists, and any moment that one stopped was always devoted\r\nby our ponies to grubbing for blades of grass in the holes. On our\r\nreturn to the ship the crew could not help noticing that the skipper\r\nfor many days ceased to patronize the lockers or any other seat, and\r\nsoon they were rejoicing that for some reason he was unable to sit\r\ndown at all. He explained it by saying that his ponies ate so much\r\nlava that it stuck out under their skins, and I myself recall feeling\r\ninclined to agree with him.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Lake Forest to Labrador would have been a tedious\r\none, but by good fortune a friend from New York had arranged to come\r\nand visit the coast in his steam yacht, the Enchantress, and was good\r\nenough to pick me up at Bras d'Or. Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, who had\r\npreviously shown me much kindness, permitted us to rendezvous at his\r\nhouse, and for a second time I enjoyed seeing some of the experiments\r\nof his most versatile brain. His aeroplanes, telephones, and other\r\ninventions were all intensely interesting, but among his other lines\r\nof work the effort to develop a race of sheep, which had litters just\r\nas pigs do, interested me most.\r\n\r\nFrancis Sayre, whom I had heard win the prize at Williams with his\r\nvaledictory speech, was again to be my summer secretary. On our\r\narrival at St. Anthony we found a great deal going on. The fame as a\r\nsurgeon of my colleague, Dr. John Mason Little, had spread so widely\r\nthat St. Anthony Hospital would no longer hold the patients who sought\r\nassistance at it. Fifty would arrive on a single mail boat. They were\r\ndumped down on the little wharf, having been landed in small punts\r\nfrom the steamer, as in those days we had no proper dock to which the\r\nboats could come. The little waiting-room in the hospital at night\r\nresembled nothing so much as a newly opened sardine tin; and to cater\r\nfor the waiting patients was a Sisyphean task without the Hercules.\r\nThrough the instrumentality of Dr. Little's sister a fund of ten\r\nthousand dollars was raised to double the size of the hospital, and\r\nthe work of building was begun on my return. Although the capacity was\r\ngreatly increased thereby we have really been unable ever to make our\r\nbuilding what it ought to be to meet the problem. The first part,\r\nconstructed of green lumber hauled from the woods, and other wings\r\nadded at different periods of growth, the endeavour to blast out\r\nsuitable heating-plant accommodations--all this has left the hospital\r\nbuilding more or less a thing of rags and patches, and most\r\nuneconomical to run. We are urgently in need of having it rebuilt\r\nentirely of either brick or stone, in order to resist the winter cold,\r\nto give more efficiency and comfort to patients and staff and to\r\nconserve our fuel, which is the most serious item of expense we have\r\nto meet.\r\n\r\nBut at that time with all its capacity for service the new addition\r\nwas rising, sounding yet one more note of praise in better ability to\r\nmeet the demands upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd _pari passu_ came the beautiful offer of my friend, Mr. Sayre, to\r\ndouble the size of our orphanage, putting up the new wing in memory of\r\nhis father. This meant that instead of twenty we might now accommodate\r\nforty children at a pinch. Life is so short that it is the depths of\r\npathos to be hampered in doing one's work for the lack of a few\r\ndollars. Of great interest to my fiancée and myself was the selection\r\nof a piece of ground adjoining the Mission land, and the erection for\r\nourselves of the home which we had planned and designed together\r\nbefore I had left Lake Forest. We chose some land up on the hillside\r\nand overlooking the sea and the harbour, where the view should be as\r\ncomprehensive as possible. But we feared that even though our new\r\nhouse was very literally \"founded upon a rock,\" the winds might some\r\nday remove it bodily from its abiding-place, and therefore we riveted\r\nthe structure with heavy iron bolts to the solid bedrock.\r\n\r\nOne excitement of that season was Admiral Peary's return from the\r\nNorth Pole. We were cruising near Indian Harbour when some visitors\r\ncame aboard to make use of our wireless telegraph, which at that time\r\nwe had installed on board. It proved to be Mr. Harry Whitney. It was\r\nthe first intimation that we had had that Peary was returning that\r\nyear. Whitney had met Cook coming back from the polar sea on the west\r\nside of the Gulf, where he had disappeared about eighteen months\r\npreviously. I had met Dr. Cook several times myself, and indeed I had\r\nslept at his house in Brooklyn. He had visited Battle Harbour Hospital\r\nin 1893 when he was wrecked in the steamer in which he was conducting\r\na party to visit Greenland. We had again seen him as he went North\r\nwith Mr. Bradley in the yacht, and he had sent us back some Greenland\r\ndogs to mix their blood with our dogs, and so perhaps improve their\r\nbreed and endurance. These, however, I had later felt it necessary to\r\nkill, for the Greenland dogs carry the dangerous tapeworm which is\r\nsuch a menace to man, and of which our Labrador dogs are entirely free\r\nso far.\r\n\r\nThe picture of this meeting on the ice between Cook and Whitney gave\r\nus the impression of another Nansen and Jackson at Spitzbergen.\r\nWhitney had welcomed Cook warmly, had witnessed his troubles at Etah,\r\nand his departure by komatik, and had taken charge of his instruments\r\nand records to carry South with him when he came home. But his ship\r\nwas delayed and delayed, and when Peary in the Roosevelt passed on his\r\nway South, fearing to be left another winter Whitney had accepted a\r\npassage on her at the cost of leaving Cook's material behind. He had\r\nmet his own boat farther south and had transferred to her. He left the\r\nimpression very firmly on all our minds that both he and Dr. Cook\r\nreally believed that the latter had found the long-sought Pole.\r\n\r\nA little later, while cruising in thick weather in the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, my wireless operator came in and said: \"There can be no harm\r\ntelling you, Doctor, that Peary is at Battle Harbour. He is wiring to\r\nWashington that he has found the Pole, and also he is asking his\r\ncommittee if he may present the Mission with his superfluous supplies,\r\nor whether he is to sell them to you.\" Seeing that it is not easy to\r\nknow whence wireless messages come if the sender does not own up to\r\nhis whereabouts, I at once ordered him to wireless to Peary at Battle\r\nthe simple words: \"Give it to them, of course,\" and sign it\r\n\"Washington.\" I knew that the Commander would see the joke, and if the\r\ndecision turned out later to be incorrect, it could easily be\r\nrectified by purchasing the goods. A tin of his brown bread now lies\r\namong my curios and one of his sledges is in my barn.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: COMMODORE PEARY ON HIS WAY BACK FROM THE POLE,\r\n   1909]\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Battle Harbour we found the Roosevelt lying at the\r\nwharf repainting and refitting. A whole host of newspaper men and\r\nother friends had come North to welcome the explorer home. Battle was\r\nquite a gay place; but it was living up to its name, for Peary not\r\nonly claimed that he had found the Pole, but also that Cook had not;\r\nand he was realizing what a hard thing it is to prove a negative. We\r\nhad a very delightful time with the party, and greatly enjoyed meeting\r\nall the members of the expedition. Among them was the ill-fated Borup,\r\ndestined shortly to be drowned on a simple canoe trip, and the\r\nindomitable and athletic Macmillan who subsequently led the Crocker\r\nLand expedition, our own schooner George B. Cluett carrying them to\r\nEtah.\r\n\r\nMy secretary, Mr. Sayre, was just about to leave for America, and at\r\nPeary's request he transferred to the Roosevelt with his typewriter,\r\nto help the Commander with a few of his many notes and records. I dare\r\nsay that he got an inside view of the question then agitating the\r\nworld from Washington to Copenhagen; but if so, he has remained\r\nforever silent about it. For our part we were glad that some one had\r\nfound the Pole, for it has been a costly quest in both fine men and\r\nvaluable time, energy, and money. It has caused lots of trouble and\r\nsorrow, and so far at least its practical issues have been few.\r\n\r\nOur wedding had been scheduled for November, and for the first time I\r\nhad found a Labrador summer long. In the late fall I left for Chicago\r\non a mission that had no flavour of the North Pole about it. We were\r\nmarried in Grace Episcopal Church, Chicago, on November 18, 1909. Our\r\nwedding was followed by a visit to the Hot Springs of Virginia; and\r\nthen \"heigho,\" and a flight for the North. We sailed from St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland, in January. I had assured my wife, who is an excellent\r\nsailor, that she would scarcely notice the motion of the ship on the\r\ncoastal trip of three hundred miles. Instead of five days, it took\r\nnine; and we steamed straight out of the Narrows at St. John's into a\r\nhead gale and a blizzard of snow. The driving spray froze onto every\r\nthing till the ship was sugared like a vast Christmas cake. It made\r\nthe home which we had built at St. Anthony appear perfectly\r\ndelightful. My wife had had her furniture sent North during the\r\nsummer, so that now the \"Lares and Penates\" with which she had been\r\nfamiliar from childhood seemed to extend a mute but hearty welcome to\r\nus from their new setting.\r\n\r\nWe have three children, all born at St. Anthony. Our elder son,\r\nWilfred Thomason, was born in the fall of 1910; Kinloch Pascoe in the\r\nfall of 1912, two years almost to a day behind his brother; and lastly\r\na daughter, Rosamond Loveday, who followed her brothers in 1917. In\r\nthe case of the two latter children the honours of the name were\r\ndivided between both sides of the family, Kinloch and Rosamond being\r\nold family names on my wife's side, while, on the other hand, there\r\nhave been Pascoe and Loveday Grenfells from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nNearly ten years have now rolled away since our marriage. The puzzle\r\nto me is how I ever got along before; and these last nine years have\r\nbeen so crowded with the activities and worries of the increasing\r\ncares of a growing work, that without the love and inspiration and\r\nintellectual help of a true comrade, I could never have stood up under\r\nthem. Every side of life is developed and broadened by companionship.\r\nI admit of no separation of life into \"secular\" and \"religious.\"\r\nReligion, if it means anything, means the life and activities of our\r\ndivine spirit on earth in relation to our Father in heaven. I am\r\nconvinced from experience of the supreme value to that of a happy\r\nmarriage, and that \"team work\" is God's plan for us on this earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nNEW VENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo human life can be perfect, or even be lived without troubles. Clams\r\nhave their troubles, I dare say. A queer sort of sinking feeling just\r\nlike descending in a fast elevator comes over one, as if trouble and\r\nthe abdominal viscera had a direct connection. Some one has said that\r\nit must be because that is where the average mind centres. Thus, when\r\nwe lost the little steamer Swallow which we were towing, and with it\r\nthe evidence of a crime and the road to the prevention of its\r\nrepetition, it absolutely sickened me for two or three days, or, to be\r\nmore exact, during two or three nights. It was all quite unnecessary,\r\nfor we can see now that the matter worked out for the best. The fact\r\nthat troubles hurt most when one is at rest and one's mind unoccupied,\r\nand in the night when one's vitality is lowest, is a great comfort,\r\nbecause that shows how it is something physical that is at fault, and\r\nno physical troubles are of very great importance.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1910 brought me a fine crop of personal worries, and\r\nprobably deservedly so, for no one should leave his business affairs\r\ntoo much to another, without guarantees, occasionally renewed, that\r\nall is well. Few professional men are good at business, and personally\r\nI have no liking for it. This, combined with an over-readiness to\r\naccept as helpers men whose only qualifications have sometimes been of\r\ntheir own rating, was really spoiling for trouble--and mine came\r\nthrough the series of coöperative stores.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, none of the stores were incorporated, and their\r\nliabilities were therefore unlimited. Though I had always felt it best\r\nnot to accept a penny of interest, I had been obliged to loan them\r\nmoney, and their agent in St. John's, who was also mine, allowed them\r\nconsiderable latitude in credits. It was, indeed, a bolt from the blue\r\nwhen I was informed that the merchants in St. John's were owed by the\r\nstores the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, and that I was being\r\nheld responsible for every cent of it--because on the strength of\r\ntheir faith in me, and their knowledge that I was interested in the\r\nstores, having brought them into being, they had been willing to let\r\nthe credits mount up. Even then I still had all my work to carry on\r\nand little time to devote to money affairs. Had I accepted, on first\r\nentering the Mission, the salary offered me, which was that of my\r\npredecessor, I should have been able to meet these liabilities, and\r\nvery gladly indeed would I have done so. As it was I had to find some\r\nway out. All the merchants interested were told of the facts, and\r\nasked to meet me at the office of one of them, go over the accounts\r\nwith my agent, and try and find a plan to settle. One can have little\r\nheart in his work if he feels every one who looks at him really thinks\r\nthat he is a defaulter. The outcome of the inquiry revealed that if\r\nthe agent could not show which store owed each debt, neither could the\r\nmerchants; some had made out their bills to separate stores, some all\r\nto one store, and some in a general way to myself, though not one\r\nsingle penny of the debt was a personal one of my own.\r\n\r\nThe next discovery was that the manager of the St. Anthony store, who\r\nhad been my summer secretary before, and was an exceedingly pious\r\nman--whose great zeal for cottage prayer meetings, and that form of\r\nreligious work, had led me to think far too highly of him--had\r\nneglected his books. He had given credit to every one who came along\r\n(though it was a cardinal statute under his rules that no credit was\r\nto be allowed except at his own personal risk). The St. John's agent\r\nclaimed that he had made a loss of twelve thousand dollars in a little\r\nover a year, in which he professed to have been able to pay ten per\r\ncent to shareholders and put by three hundred dollars to reserve.\r\nBesides this, the new local store secretary had mixed up affairs by\r\nboth ordering supplies direct from Canada and sending produce there,\r\nwhich the St. John's agent claimed were owed to the merchants in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThese two men, instead of pulling together, were, I found, bitter\r\nenemies; and it looked as if the whole pack of cards were tumbling\r\nabout my ears. I cashed every available personal asset which I could.\r\nThe beautiful schooner, Emma E. White, also a personal possession,\r\narrived in St. John's while we were there with a full load of lumber,\r\nbut it and she sailed straight into the melting-pot. The merchants,\r\nwith one exception, were all as good about the matter as men can be.\r\nThey were perfectly satisfied when they realized that I meant facing\r\nthe debt squarely. One was nasty about it, saying that he would not\r\nwait--and oddly enough in ordinary life he was a man whom one would\r\nnot expect to be ungenerous, for he too was a religious man. Whether\r\nhe gained by it or not it is hard to say. He was paid first, anyhow.\r\nThe standard of what is really remunerative in life is differently\r\ngraded. The stores have dealt with him since, and his prices are fair\r\nand honest; but he was the only one among some twenty who even\r\nappeared to kick a man when he was down. I have nothing but gratitude\r\nto all the rest.\r\n\r\nI should add that the incident was not the fault of the people of the\r\ncoast. Often I had been warned by the merchants that the coöperative\r\nstores would fail and that the people would rob me. It is true that\r\nthere was trouble over the badly kept books, and a number of the\r\nfishermen disclaimed their debts charged against them; but with one\r\nexception no one came and said that he had had things which were not\r\nnoted on the bills. I am confident, however, that they did not go back\r\non me willingly, and when my merchant friends said, \"I told you so,\" I\r\nhonestly was able to state that it was the management, not the people\r\nor the system, that was at fault. Indeed, subsequent events have\r\nproved this. For five of the stores still run, and run splendidly, and\r\npay handsomer dividends by far than any investment our people could\r\npossibly make elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWith the sale of a few investments and some other available property,\r\nthe liability was so far reduced that, with what the stores paid, only\r\none merchant was not fully indemnified, and he generously told me not\r\nto worry about the balance.\r\n\r\nThis same year, on the other hand, one of our most forward steps, so\r\nfar as the Mission was concerned, was taken, through the generosity of\r\nthe late Mr. George B. Cluett, of Troy, New York. He had built\r\nspecially for our work a magnificent three-masted schooner, fitted\r\nwith the best of gear including a motor launch. She was constructed of\r\nthree-inch oak plank, sheathed with hardwood for work in the\r\nice-fields. She was also fitted with an eighty horse-power Wolverine\r\nengine. The bronze tablet in her bore the inscription, \"This vessel\r\nwith full equipment was presented to Wilfred T. Grenfell by George B.\r\nCluett.\" He had previously asked me if I would like any words from the\r\nBible on the plate, and I had suggested, \"The sea is His and He made\r\nit.\" The designer unfortunately put the text after the inscription; so\r\nthat I have been frequently asked why and how I came to make it,\r\nseeing that it is believed by all good Christians that in heaven\r\n\"there shall be no more sea.\"\r\n\r\nTo help out with the expenses of getting her running, our loved friend\r\nfrom Chicago, Mr. W.R. Stirling, agreed to come North on the schooner\r\nthe first season, bringing his two daughters and three friends. Even\r\nthough he was renting her for a yachting trip, he offered to bring all\r\nthe cargo free and make the Mission stations his ports of call.\r\n\r\nMr. Cluett's idea was that, as we had big expenses carrying endless\r\nfreight so far North, and as it got so broken and often lost in\r\ntransit, and greatly damaged in the many changes involved from rail to\r\nsteamer, and from steamer to steamer, if she carried our freight in\r\nsummer, she could in winter earn enough to make it all free, and\r\npossibly provide a sinking fund for herself as well. There was also\r\ngood accommodation in her for doctors, nurses, students, etc., who\r\nevery summer come from the South to help in various ways in the work\r\nof the Mission.\r\n\r\nAll our freight that year arrived promptly and in good condition,\r\nwhich had never happened before. Later the vessel was chartered to go\r\nto Greenland by the Smithsonian. On this occasion her engine, never\r\nsatisfactory, gave out entirely, which so delayed her that she got\r\nfrozen in near Etah and was held up a whole twelvemonth. Meanwhile the\r\nwar had broken out, and when she at last sailed into Boston, we were\r\nable to sell her, by the generous permission of Mrs. Cluett, and use\r\nthe money to purchase the George B. Cluett II.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the advantage of getting our freight direct, among the\r\nmany instances which have occurred, that of the lost searchlight for\r\nthe Strathcona comes to my mind. As she had often on dark nights to\r\ncome to anchor among vessels, and to nose her way into unlit harbours,\r\nsome friends, through the Professor of Geology at Harvard, who had\r\nhimself cruised all along our coast in a schooner, presented me with a\r\nsearchlight for the hospital ship and despatched it _via_ Sydney--the\r\nnormal freight route. Month after month went by, and it never\r\nappeared. Year followed year, and still we searched for that\r\nsearchlight. At length, after two and a half years, it suddenly\r\narrived, having been \"delayed on the way.\" Had it been provisions or\r\nclothing or drugs, or almost anything else, of course, it would have\r\nbeen useless. It has proved to us one of the almost _de luxe_\r\nadditions to a Mission steamer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time I had felt the need of some place in St. John's where\r\nwork for fishermen could be carried on, and which could be also\r\nutilized as a place of safety for girls coming to that city from other\r\nparts of the island. My attention was called one day to the fact that\r\nliquor was being sent to people in the outports C.O.D., by a barrel of\r\nflour which was being lowered over the side of the mail steamer rather\r\ntoo quickly on to the ice. As the hard bump came, the flour in the\r\nbarrel jingled loudly and leaked rum profusely from the compound\r\nfracture. When our sober outport people went to St. John's, as they\r\nmust every year for supplies, they had only the uncomfortable schooner\r\nor the street in which to pass the time. There is no \"Foyer des\r\nPêcheurs\"; no one wanted fishermen straight from a fishing schooner in\r\nthe home; and in those days there were no Camp Community Clubs. As one\r\nman said, \"It is easy for the parson to tell us to be good, but it is\r\nhard on a wet cold night to be good in the open street\" and nowhere to\r\ngo, and harder still if you have to seek shelter in a brightly lighted\r\nroom, where music was being played. The boarding-houses for the\r\nfishermen, where thousands of our young men flocked in the spring to\r\ntry for a berth in the seal fishery, were ridiculous, not to say\r\ncalamitous. Lastly, unsophisticated girls coming from the outports ran\r\nterrible risks in the city, having no friends to direct and assist\r\nthem; and the Institute which we had in mind was to comprise also a\r\ngirls' lodging department. No provision was made for the accommodation\r\nof crews wrecked by accident, and our Institute has already proved\r\ninvaluable to many in such plights.\r\n\r\nSeeing the hundreds of craft and the thousands of fishermen, and the\r\ncapital and interest vested against us as prohibitionists, it would\r\nhave been obviously futile to put up a second-rate affair in a back\r\nstreet. It would only be sneered at as a proselytizing job. I had\r\nalmost forgotten to mention that there was already an Old Seamen's\r\nHome, but it had gradually become a roost for boozers, and when with\r\nthe trustees we made an inspection of it, it proved to be only worthy\r\nof immediate closure. This was promptly done, and the money realized\r\nfrom the sale of it, some ten thousand dollars, was kindly donated to\r\nthe fund for our new building.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of my collecting funds spasmodically, a number of\r\nour local friends got \"cold feet.\" Reports started, not circulated by\r\nwell-wishers, that it was all a piece of personal vanity, that no such\r\nthing was needed, and if built would prove a white elephant, to\r\nsupport which I would be going round with my hat in my hand worrying\r\nthe merchants. We had at that time some ninety thousand dollars in\r\nhand. I laid the whole story before the Governor, Sir Ralph Williams,\r\na man by no means prejudiced in favour of prohibition. He was,\r\nhowever, one who knew what the city needed, and realized that it was a\r\nbig lack and required a big remedy.\r\n\r\nA letter which I published in all the St. John's papers, describing my\r\npassing fifteen drunken men on the streets before morning service on\r\nChristmas Day, brought forth angry denials of the actual facts, and my\r\nstatement of the number of saloons in the city was also contradicted.\r\nBut a saloon is not necessarily a place licensed by the Government or\r\ncity to make men drunk--for the majority are unlicensed, and a couple\r\nof experiences which my men had in looking for sailors who had\r\nshipped, been given advances, and gone off and got drunk in shebeens,\r\nproved the number to be very much higher than even I had estimated it.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph thought the matter over and called a public meeting in the\r\nballroom of Government House. He had a remarkable personality and no\r\nfear of conventions. After thoroughly endorsing the plan for the\r\nInstitute, and the need for it, he asked each of the many citizens who\r\nhad responded to his invitation, \"Will you personally stand by the\r\nlarger scheme of a two hundred thousand dollar building, or will you\r\nstand by the sixty thousand dollar building with the thirty thousand\r\ndollar endowment fund, or will you do nothing at all?\" It was proven\r\nthat when it came to the point of going on record, practically all who\r\nreally took the slightest interest in the matter were in favour of the\r\nlarger plan--if I would undertake to raise the money. My own view,\r\nsince more than justified, was that only so large a building could\r\never hope to meet the requirements and only such a comprehensive\r\ninstitution could expect to carry its own expenses. I preferred\r\nrefunding the ninety thousand dollars to the various donors and\r\ndropping the whole business to embarking on the smaller scheme.\r\n\r\nThat meeting did a world of good. It cleared the atmosphere; and it is\r\nonly fresh air which most of these things really need--just as does a\r\nconsumptive patient. The plan was now on the shoulders of the\r\ncitizens; it was no longer one man's hobby. Enemies, like the Scribes\r\nand Pharisees of old, knew better than to tackle a crowd, and with the\r\nsplendid gift of Messrs. Bowring Brothers of a site on the water-side\r\non the main street, costing thirteen thousand dollars, and those of\r\nJob Brothers, Harvey and Company, and Macpherson Brothers of\r\ntwenty-five hundred dollars each, the fund grew like Jonah's gourd;\r\nand in the year of 1911, with approximately one hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand dollars in hand, we actually came to the time\r\nfor laying the foundation stone. The hostility of enemies was not\r\nover. Such an institute is a fighting force, and involves contest and\r\ntherefore enemies. So we decided to make this occasion as much of an\r\nevent as we could. Through friends in England we obtained the promise\r\nof King George V that if we connected the foundation stone with\r\nBuckingham Palace by wire, he would, after the ceremony in Westminster\r\nAbbey on his Coronation Day, press a button at three in the afternoon\r\nand lay the stone across the Atlantic. The good services of friends in\r\nthe Anglo-American Telegraph Company did the rest.\r\n\r\nOn the fateful day His Excellency the Governor came down and made an\r\nappropriate and patriotic speech. Owing to the difference in time of\r\nabout three hours and twenty minutes, it was shortly before twelve\r\no'clock with us. The noonday gun signal from the Narrows was fired\r\nduring His Excellency's address. Then followed a prayer of invocation\r\nby His Lordship the Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda--and then, a\r\ndead silence and pause. Every one was waiting for our newly crowned\r\nKing to put that stone into place. Only a moment had passed, the\r\nGovernor had just said, \"We will wait for the King,\" when \"Bing, bang,\r\nbang,\" went the gong signifying that His Majesty was at the other end\r\nof the wire. Up went the national flag, and slowly but surely the\r\ngreat stone began to move. A storm of cheering greeted the successful\r\neffort; and all that was left for our enemies to say was, \"It was a\r\nfake.\" They claimed that we had laid the stone ourselves. Nor might\r\nthey have been so far off the mark as they supposed, for we had a man\r\nwith a knife under that platform to make that stone come down if\r\nanything happened that the wire device did not work. You cannot go\r\nback on your King whatever else you do, and to permit any grounds to\r\nexist for supposing that he had not been punctual was unthinkable. But\r\nfortunately for all concerned our subterfuge was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI have omitted so far to state one of the main reasons why the\r\nInstitute to our mind was so desirable. That was because no\r\nundenominational work is carried on practically in the whole country.\r\nReligion is tied up in bundles and its energies used to divide rather\r\nthan to unite men. No Y.M.C.A. or Y.W.C.A. could exist in the Colony\r\nfor that reason. The Boys' Brigade which we had originally started\r\ncould not continue, any more than the Boy Scouts can now. Catholic\r\nCadets, Church Lads Brigade, Methodist Guards, Presbyterian Highland\r\nBrigade--are all names symbolic of the dividing influences of\r\n\"religion.\" In no place of which I know would a Y.M.C.A. be more\r\ndesirable; and a large meeting held in the Institute this present\r\nspring decided that in no town anywhere was a Y.W.C.A. more needed.\r\n\r\nIn another place in this book I have spoken of the problem of alcohol\r\nand fishermen. A man does not need alcohol and is far better without\r\nit. A man who sees two lights when there is only one is not wanted at\r\nthe wheel. The people who sell alcohol know that just as well as we\r\ndo, but for paltry gain they are unpatriotic enough to barter their\r\nearthly country as well as their heavenly one, and to be branded with\r\nthe knowledge that they are cursing men and ruining families. The\r\nfilibuster deserves the name no less because he does his destructive\r\nwork secretly and slowly, and wears the emblems of respectability\r\ninstead of operating in the open with \"Long Toms\" under the shadow of\r\nthe \"Jolly Roger.\"\r\n\r\nAs a magistrate on this coast I have been obliged more than once to\r\nact as a policeman, and though one hated the ill-feeling which it\r\nstored up, and did not enjoy the evil-speaking to which it gave rise,\r\nI considered that it was really only like lancing a concealed\r\ninfection--the ill-feeling and evil-speaking were better tapped and\r\nlet out.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion at one of our Labrador hospitals a beardless youth,\r\none of the Methodist candidates for college who every year are sent\r\ndown to look after the interests of that denomination on our North\r\ncoast, came to inform me that the only other magistrate on the coast,\r\nthe pillar of the Church of England, and shortly to be our\r\nstipendiary, who had many political friends of great influence in St.\r\nJohn's, was keeping a \"blind tiger,\" while many even of his own people\r\nwere being ruined body and soul by this temptation under their noses.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"if you will come and give the evidence which will\r\nlead to conviction, I will do the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly will,\" he answered. And he did. So we got the little\r\nStrathcona under way, and after steaming some fifteen miles dropped\r\ninto a small cove a mile or two from the place where our friend lived.\r\nIn the King's name we constrained a couple of men to come along as\r\nspecial constables. Our visit was an unusual one. To divert suspicion\r\nwe dressed our ship in bunting as if we were coming for a marriage\r\nlicense. When we anchored as near his stage as possible, we dropped\r\nour jolly-boat and made for the store. The door was, however, locked\r\nand our friend nowhere to be seen. \"He is in the store\" was the reply\r\nof his wife to our query. We knew then that there was no time to be\r\nlost, and even while we battered at the door, we could hear a\r\nsuspicious gurgle and smell a curious odour. Rum was trickling down\r\nthrough the cracks of the store floor on to the astonished winkles\r\nbelow. But the door quickly gave way before our overtures, and we\r\ncaught the magistrate _flagrante delicto_. We were threatened with all\r\nsorts of big folk in St. John's; but we held the trial on board\r\nstraightaway just the same. When court was called, the defendant\r\ndemanded the name of the prosecutor--and to his infinite surprise out\r\npopped the youthful aspirant to the Methodist ministry. When he\r\nlearned that half of his fine of seventy dollars had to be paid to the\r\nprosecutor and would be applied toward the building of a Methodist\r\nschool, his temper completely ran away with him; and we had to\r\nthreaten auction on the spot of the goods in the store before we could\r\ncollect the money. We left him breathing out threatenings and\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE INSTITUTE]\r\n\r\nOnly once was I really caught. Two mothers in a little village had\r\nappealed to me because liquor was being sold to their boys who had no\r\nmoney, while people were complaining simultaneously that fish was\r\nbeing stolen from their stages. No one would tell who was selling it,\r\nso we had a systematic search made of all the houses, and the guilty\r\nman was convicted on evidence discovered under the floor of his\r\nsitting-room. The fine of fifty dollars he paid without a murmur and\r\nit was promptly divided between the Government and the prosecutor. It\r\nso happened, however, that he had obtained from us for a close\r\nrelative a new artificial leg, and there was fifty dollars owing to\r\nus on it. Unknown to us at the time, he had collected that fifty\r\ndollars from the said relative and with it paid his fine. To this day\r\nwe never got a cent for our leg, and so really fined ourselves. Nor\r\ncould we with any propriety distrain on one of a poor woman's legs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS ON LAND AND SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1912 was a busy season. The New Year found us in Florida with\r\nthe donor of the ship George B. Cluett, consulting him concerning its\r\nprogress and future. Lecturing then as we went west we reached\r\nColorado, visited the Grand Canyon, and lectured all along the Pacific\r\nCoast from San Diego to Victoria--finding many old friends and making\r\nmany new ones.\r\n\r\nAt Berkeley I was asked to deliver the Earle Lectures at the\r\nUniversity of California; and I also spoke to an immense audience in\r\nthe open Greek theatre--a most novel experience. At Santa Barbara a\r\nspecial meeting had been arranged by our good friend Dr. Joseph\r\nAndrews, who every year travels all the way from California to St.\r\nAnthony at his own expense to afford the fishermen of our Northern\r\nwaters the inestimable benefits of his skill as a consulting eye\r\nspecialist. Many blind he has restored to sight who would otherwise be\r\nencumbrances to themselves and others. Only last year I received the\r\nfollowing communication from an eager would-be patient: \"Dear Dr.\r\nGrandfield, when is the eye spider coming to St. Anthony? I needs to\r\nsee him bad.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Tacoma a visitor, saying that he was an old\r\nacquaintance of mine, sent up his card to our room. He had driven over\r\nin a fine motor car, and was a great, broad-shouldered man. The grip\r\nwhich he gave me assured me that he had been brought up hard, but I\r\nutterly failed to place him. With a broad grin he relieved the\r\nsituation by saying: \"The last time that we met, Doctor, was on the\r\ndeck of a fishing vessel in the North Sea. I was second hand aboard,\r\nsailing out from Grimsby.\" The tough surroundings of that life were\r\nsuch a contrast to his present apparently ample means that I could\r\nonly say, \"How on earth did you get out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend,\" said he, \"gave me a little book entitled 'One Hundred Ways\r\nto Rise in the World.' The first ninety-nine were no good to me, but\r\nthe hundredth said, 'Go to Western America,' so I just cleared out and\r\ncame here.\" He was exceedingly kind to us, even accompanying us to\r\nSeattle, and his story of pluck and enterprise was a splendid\r\nstimulus.\r\n\r\nSix weeks of lecturing nearly every single night in a new town in\r\nCanada gave me a real vision of Canadian Western life, and a sincere\r\nadmiration for its people who are making a nation of which the world\r\nis proud.\r\n\r\nIn April a large meeting was held in New York to reorganize the\r\nmanagement of the Mission. The English Royal National Mission to\r\nDeep-Sea Fishermen was no longer able or willing to finance, much less\r\nto direct, affairs which had gone beyond their control, and was hoping\r\nto arrange an organization of an international character to which all\r\nthe affairs of the enterprise could be turned over. This organization\r\nwas formed at the house of Mr. Eugene Delano, the head of Brown\r\nBrothers, bankers, whose lifelong help has meant for Labrador more\r\nthan he will ever know.\r\n\r\nThe International Grenfell Association was incorporated to comprise\r\nthe Labrador branches of the Royal National Mission to Deep-Sea\r\nFishermen as its English component, the Grenfell Association of\r\nAmerica and the New England Grenfell Association to represent the\r\nAmerican interests, the Labrador Medical Mission as the Canadian name\r\nfor its Society, and the Newfoundland Grenfell Association for the\r\nNewfoundland branch. Each one of these component societies has two\r\nmembers in the Central Council, and together they make up the Board of\r\nDirectors of the International Grenfell Association. These directors\r\never since have generously been giving their time and interest in the\r\nwise and efficient administration of this work. To these unselfish men\r\nLabrador and northern Newfoundland, as well as I, owe a greater debt\r\nthan can ever be repaid.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May I was due to speak at the annual meeting of the\r\nEnglish Mission in London, and the swift heels of the Mauretania once\r\nmore stood us in good stead; for we reached England the evening before\r\nMay 1, arrived in London at 2 A.M., and I spoke three times that day.\r\nAfter a day or so at my old home with my mother we ran about in a Ford\r\ncar for a fortnight, lecturing every evening. The little motor saved\r\nendless energy otherwise lost in endeavouring to make connections, and\r\ngave us the opportunity to see numbers of old friends whom we must\r\notherwise have missed. One day we would be at a meeting of miners at\r\nRedmuth in Cornwall, on another at Harrow or Rugby Schools. At the\r\nlatter, an old college friend, who is now head master there, gave us a\r\nroyal welcome. During the last fortnight at home a splendid chance was\r\nafforded me to visit daily the clinics of an old friend, Sir Robert\r\nJones, England's famous orthopedic surgeon. He is one of the most\r\nwonderful and practical of men, and he opened our eyes to the\r\npossibility of medical mission work in the very heart of England--for\r\nif ever there was an apostle of hope for the deformed and paralyzed he\r\ncertainly is the man. His Sunday morning free clinics crowded even the\r\nstreet opposite his office door with waiting patients of the poorest\r\nclass. Equally beneficent also is the large and wonderful hospital\r\nbuilt specially for derelict children on the heather-covered hills\r\njust above our home in Cheshire. But most unique of all was his\r\nBasschurch Hospital, constructed mostly of sheet iron, standing in the\r\nmiddle of a field in the country forty miles away from Liverpool.\r\nEvery second Sunday, Sir Robert Jones used to motor over there and\r\noperate \"in the field.\" No expedition have I ever enjoyed better in my\r\nlife than when he was good enough to pick us up on his way, and we saw\r\nhim tackle the motley collection of halt and lame, whom the lady of\r\nthe hospital, herself a marvellous testimony to his skill, collected\r\nfrom the neighbouring town slums between his visits. The hospital was\r\nthe nearest thing I know to our little \"one-horse shows\" scattered\r\nalong the Labrador coast; and there was a homing feeling in one's\r\nheart all the time at these open-air clinics.\r\n\r\nAs commander-in-chief of the orthopedic work of the British Army in\r\nthe war, I am certain that Colonel Sir Robert Jones has found the\r\nexperiences of his improvised clinics among the most valuable assets\r\nhe could have had. One day he has promised that he will bring his\r\nmagic wand to Labrador; for he is a sportsman in the best sense of the\r\nword as well as a healer of limbs.\r\n\r\nThe quickest way back to St. John's being _via_ Canada, we returned by\r\nthe Allan Line, and lectured in the Maritime Provinces as we passed\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that one must possess an insatiable love of lecturing.\r\nAs a matter of fact, nothing is farther from the truth. But the\r\nbrevity of life is an insistent fact in our existence, and the\r\ninability to do good work for lack of help that is so gladly given\r\nwhen the reasonableness of the expenditure is presented, makes one\r\nfeel guilty if an evening is spent doing nothing. The lecturing is by\r\nfar the most uncongenial task which I have been called upon to do in\r\nlife, but in a mission like ours, which is not under any special\r\nchurch, the funds must be raised to a very great extent by voluntary\r\ndonations, and in order to secure these friends must be kept informed\r\nof the progress of the work which their gifts are making possible.\r\n\r\nFor the first seven years of my work I never spent the winters in the\r\ncountry--nor was it my intention ever to do so. Besides the general\r\ndirection of the whole, my work as superintendent has meant the\r\nraising of the necessary funds, and my special charge on the actual\r\ncoast has been the hospital ship Strathcona. Naturally, owing to our\r\nfrozen winter sea this is only possible during open water. Since 1902\r\nit has been my custom when possible to spend every other winter as\r\nwell as every summer in the North. The actual work and life there is a\r\ntremendous rest after the nervous and physical tax of a lecture tour.\r\nAt first I used to wonder at the lack of imagination in those who\r\nwould greet me, after some long, wearisome hours on the train or in a\r\ncrowded lecture hall, with \"What a lovely holiday you are having!\" Now\r\nthis oft-repeated comment only amuses me.\r\n\r\nIt was just after the first of June when again we found ourselves\r\nheading North for St. Anthony, only once more to be caught in the jaws\r\nof winter. For the heavy Arctic ice blockaded the whole of the eastern\r\nFrench shore, and we had to be content to be held up in small\r\nice-bound harbours as we pushed along through the inner edge of the\r\nfloe, till strong westerly winds cleared the way.\r\n\r\nHaving reached St. Anthony and looked into matters there, we once\r\nagain ran south to St. John's to inspect the new venture of the\r\nInstitute. To help out expenses we towed for the whole four hundred\r\nmiles a schooner which had been wrecked on the Labrador coast, having\r\nrun on the rocks, and knocked a hole in her bottom. She had a number\r\nof sacks of \"hard bread\" on board. These had been thrown into the\r\nbreach and planking nailed on over them. The bread had swelled up\r\nbetween the two casings and become so hard again that the vessel\r\nleaked but little; and though the continual dirge of the pumps was\r\nsomewhat dismal as we journeyed, we had no reason to fear that she\r\nwould go to the bottom.\r\n\r\nFlour resists water in a marvellous way. On one occasion our own\r\nvessel in the North Sea was run into by another. The latter's cutwater\r\nwent through her side and deck almost to the combing of the hatch, and\r\nthe water began to pour in. By immediately putting the vessel on the\r\nother tack, the rent was largely lifted out of water. A heavy topsail\r\nwas hastily thrown over her side, and eventually hauled under the\r\nkeel--the inrushing water keeping it there. Then sacks of flour were\r\nrammed into the breach. The ship in this condition, favoured by the\r\nwind which enabled her to continue on that tack, reached home, two\r\nhundred miles distant, with her hand-pumps keeping her comparatively\r\nfree, though there was the greatest difficulty to keep her afloat\r\ndirectly she was towed into the harbour and lay at the wharf.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion when a Canadian steamer, loaded with provisions,\r\nran into a cliff two hundred feet high in a fog on the northeast end\r\nof Belle Isle, and became a total wreck, her flour floated all up and\r\ndown the Straits. I remember picking up a sack that had certainly been\r\nin the water some weeks; and yet only about a quarter of an inch of\r\noutside layer was even wet.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Institute was a great day. Dr. Henry van Dyke had\r\ncome all the way from New York to give an address. Sir William\r\nArchibald, chairman of the Royal National Mission to Deep-Sea\r\nFishermen, had travelled from England to bring a blessing from the\r\nold home country; and the merchants and friends in St. John's did\r\ntheir best to make it a red-letter day. Sir Edward Morris, the Prime\r\nMinister, and other politicians, the Mayor and civic functionaries\r\nwere all good enough to come and add their quota to the launching of\r\nthe new ship. There were still pessimistic and croaking individuals,\r\nhowever, as well as joyful hearts, when a few days later we again ran\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nWe started almost immediately for our Straits trip after reaching St.\r\nAnthony. On our way east from Harrington, our most westerly hospital,\r\ncommenced in 1907, a telegram summoning me immediately to St. John's\r\ndropped upon me like a bolt from the blue. Without a moment's delay we\r\nheaded yet again South, full of anxiety as to what could be the cause\r\nof this message.\r\n\r\nOn arrival there we found that trouble had arisen concerning the funds\r\nof the Institute and a prosecution was to follow. It was the worst\r\ntime of my life. Things were readjusted; the money was refunded,\r\npunishment meted out--but such damage is not made right by\r\nreconstruction. It left permanent scars and made the end of an\r\notherwise splendid year anxious and sorrowful.\r\n\r\nThe work on East Labrador was also extended this year. While walking\r\ndown the street in New York with a young doctor friend who had once\r\nwintered with me, we met a colleague of his at the College of\r\nPhysicians and Surgeons. In the conversation it was suggested that he\r\nshould spend a summer in Labrador, and we would place him in a virgin\r\nfield. As a result Dr. Wiltsie, now in China, came North, started in\r\nwork with a little school, club, and dispensary, at a place called\r\nSpotted Islands, in a very barren group of islands about a hundred\r\nmiles north of the Straits of Belle Isle. His work became permanent as\r\nthe summer mission of the Y.M.C.A. of the College, which organization\r\nnow carries all its expenses. It has a dwelling-house, school,\r\ndispensary, small operating room, and accommodation for a couple of\r\npatients, all under one roof, and owns a fast motor boat called the P.\r\nand S., which has made itself known as an angel of mercy, every summer\r\nsince, over a hundred miles of coast and islands. It is only a summer\r\nwork, and is mainly among a schooner population; but as a testimonial\r\nto the value of pluck and unselfishness I know of no better example.\r\n\r\nAmong other ways to help Labrador we had always tried to induce\r\ntourists and yachtsmen to come and visit us. Mr. Rainey's Surf, Mr.\r\nMcCready's Enchantress, Dr. Stimson's Fleur de Lys, Mr. Arthur James's\r\nAloha, and a few other yachts had come part of the way, but no one had\r\nyet explored north of Hopedale--the latitude at which the fine\r\nNorthern scenery may be said only to begin. The large power vessels or\r\neven the best type of yacht are by no means necessary for a visit to\r\nLabrador. For the innumerable fjords and islands make it much more\r\ninteresting to be in a smaller boat, which allows one to go freely in\r\nand out of new by-ways, even when the survey is only that of your own\r\nmaking. The most sporting visits of that kind have been the honeymoon\r\nof a Philadelphia friend, who, with his wife, one man, and a canoe,\r\nwent by river to James's Bay, then _via_ Hudson Bay to Richmond Gulf,\r\nthen by portage and river to Ungava Bay, and thence home by way of the\r\nHudson Bay Company's steamer; the canoe trips of Mr. Kennedy all along\r\nthe outside eastern coast, and those of Mr. William Cabot on the\r\nsection of the northeastern coast between Hopedale and Nain. In this\r\nyear of 1912 a new little yacht appeared, the Sybil, brought down from\r\nBoston by her owner, Mr. George Williams. I had promised that if ever\r\nhe would sail down to see us in his own boat, we would escort him up\r\na salmon river for a fishing expedition--a luxury which we certainly\r\nnever anticipated would materialize. But on arriving North, there was\r\nthe beautiful little boat; and in it we sailed up into the fine salmon\r\nstream in the bay close to the hospital. Subsequently Mr. Williams\r\ncame year after year, pushing farther North each time. The Sybil he\r\neventually gave to the Mission, and built a large boat, the Jeanette,\r\nin which I had the pleasure later of exploring with him and roughly\r\ncharting three hitherto unrecorded bays.\r\n\r\nOne unusual feature of our magisterial work in 1912 was the settlement\r\nof a fisherman's strike \"down North.\" It would at first seem difficult\r\nto understand how fishermen could engineer a strike, they are so\r\ngood-natured and so long-suffering. But this time it was over the\r\nprice of fish, naturally a matter of immense importance to the\r\ncatcher. The planters, or men who give advances to come and fish\r\naround the mouth of Hamilton Inlet, were to ship their fish on a\r\nsteamer coming direct from England and returning direct--thus saving\r\ndelay and very great expense. But the price did not please the men,\r\nand they knew if they once put the fish on board at $3.50 per quintal,\r\nthe amount offered, they would never recover the $5, which was the\r\nprice for which fish was selling in St. John's that year. The more\r\nmasterful men decided that not only would they not put the fish on\r\nboard till they had cash orders or Révillon agreements for their\r\nprice, but they would not allow any of the weaker brethren to do so\r\neither. There were but few hard words and no violent deeds, but when\r\none blackleg was seen to go alongside the waiting steamer, which was\r\ncosting a hundred dollars a day to the fish-carrying merchant, a crowd\r\nof boats dashed out from creeks and corners and pounced like a vulture\r\non the big boat, fat with a fine load of fish, and not only towed her\r\naway and tied her up, but hauled her out of the water with the cargo\r\nand all in her, and dragged her so far up the side of a steep hill\r\nthat the owner was utterly unable without assistance to get her down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nEach day we had a conference with one side or the other, the\r\nGovernment having asked us to remain and see things settled. While\r\neach side was fencing for an advantage, a good-sized schooner sailed\r\ninto the harbour, brought up alongside the steamer, and was seen to\r\nbegin unloading dry fish. A dash was made for her by the boats as\r\nbefore; only this time it was the attack of Lilliputians on Gulliver.\r\nWe on the shore could not help laughing heartily when shortly we saw a\r\nstring of over a dozen fishing boats harnessed tandem in one long line\r\ntowing the interloper--as they had the blackleg--away up the inlet\r\nwhere they moored and guarded her. It appeared that the buyer had sent\r\nher to a far-off anchorage, and unknown to the strikers had had fish\r\nput into her there. The steamer might have followed and got away with\r\nthe ruse. But the skipper underestimated the enemy, always a fatal\r\nmistake, and lost out.\r\n\r\nThe agreement made a day or so later was perfectly peaceful, and\r\nperfectly satisfactory to both sides, for the fish turned out a good\r\nprice, and the buyer did not lose anything on the transaction but the\r\ndemurrage on his steamer and a little kudos, which I must confess he\r\ntook in very good spirit. Even if he did have a grasping side to his\r\ncharacter, he was fortunate in possessing a sense of humour also.\r\n\r\nThe fall brought yet another call to go South to St. John's, and once\r\nmore in the little Strathcona we ploughed our way through the long\r\nmiles to the southward. This time it was for the reorganization of the\r\nInstitute government, to form a council and to install the new\r\nmanager from England. This was Mr. Walter Jones, a man whose wide\r\nexperience among naval \"Jackies\" had been gained in a large institute\r\nof much the same kind. This gave him the credentials which we needed,\r\nfor he had made it not only a social but an economic success. He has\r\nbeen much sought by the various churches in St. John's as a speaker to\r\nmen, and his Sunday evening lantern services and lectures at the\r\nInstitute are a real source of uplift and help to men of every\r\nreligious denomination.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the year was very busy. Dr. Seymour Armstrong, formerly\r\nsurgical registrar at the Charing Cross Hospital in London, an able\r\nsurgeon, and a man of independent means, joined me for that winter at\r\nSt. Anthony. He had already wintered twice at our Labrador hospitals,\r\nand was fully expecting to give us much further help, but two years\r\nlater the great war found him at the front, where he gladly laid down\r\nhis life for his country.\r\n\r\nOne sick call that winter lives in my memory. It was a case where a\r\nnurse was really more needed than a doctor. The way was long, the wind\r\nwas cold, and the snow happened to be particularly deep. One of the\r\nnurses, however, volunteered for the journey, and I arranged to carry\r\nher on a second komatik, while my driver broke the path with our\r\nimpedimenta. Things did not go altogether well. Since I have enjoyed\r\nthe luxury of a driver, or a \"carter\" as we call them, my cunning in\r\nwriggling a komatik at full speed down steep mountain-sides through\r\ntrees has somewhat waned. Comparatively early in the day we looped the\r\nloop--and we were both heavy weights. It was nearly dark when we\r\nreached the last lap--an enormous bay with a direct run of seven miles\r\nover sea ice. We should probably have made it all right, but suddenly\r\nfog drifted in from the Straits of Belle Isle, and steering with a\r\nsmall compass and no binnacle, while attending to hauling a heavy\r\nnurse over hummocky sea ice in the dark, satisfied all my ambition for\r\nproblems. At length the nature of the ice indicated that we were\r\napproaching either land or the sea edge. We stopped the komatiks, and\r\nit fell to my lot to go ahead and explore. Finding nothing I called to\r\nthe driver, and his voice returned out of the fog right ahead of me,\r\nand almost in my ear. I had told them not to move or we might miss our\r\nway, and I reminded him of that fact. \"Haven't budged an inch\" came\r\nthe reply from the darkness. I had been describing a large circle. I\r\ncan still hear that nurse laughing.\r\n\r\nAt last we struck the huge blocks of ice, raised on the boulder rocks\r\nby the rise and fall of tide in shallow water, and we knew that we\r\nshould make the land. The perversity of nature made us turn the wrong\r\nway for the village toward which we were aiming, and we found\r\nourselves \"tangled up\" in the Boiling Brooks, a place where some\r\nunderground springs keep holes open through the ice all winter.\r\nSuddenly, while marching ahead with the compass, seeking to avoid\r\nthese springs, the ground being level enough for the nurse to act as\r\nher own helmsman, a tremendous \"whurr! whurr!\" under my feet restored\r\nsufficient leaping power to my weary legs to leave me head down and\r\nonly my racquets out of the snow--all for a covey of white partridges\r\non which I had nearly trodden. At length we made a tiny winter\r\ncottage. The nurse slept on the bench, the doctor on the floor, the\r\ndriver on a shelf. Our generous host had almost to hang himself on a\r\nhook. The dogs went hungry. But as we boiled our kettle, all agreed\r\nthat we would not have exchanged the experience for ten rides in a\r\nPullman Car.\r\n\r\nLargely through the zeal of my colleague, Dr. Arthur Wakefield, of\r\nKendal, England, and that of my cousin, Mr. Martyn Spencer, of New\r\nZealand, a band of the Legion of Frontiersmen had been brought into\r\nbeing all along this section of coast, in spite of the scattered\r\nnature of the population. The idea was that having to depend so\r\nlargely on the use of their guns, and being excellent shots with a\r\nbullet, the men would make good snipers and scouts if ever there were\r\nwar. True, most of our people called it \"playing soldiers,\" and no one\r\ntook seriously that we were ever likely to be called upon to fight;\r\nbut all Dr. Wakefield's hopes and fears were realized and our lads\r\nmade both brave soldiers and excellent marksmen.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: On the Way Home\r\n   DOG TRAVEL]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Carrying a Sick Dog\r\n   DOG TRAVEL]\r\n\r\nDr. and Mrs. Wakefield have given several years of both medical and\r\nindustrial work for the people of this coast, both in St. Anthony,\r\nForteau, Mud Lake, and Battle Harbour.\r\n\r\nAlas, the functions of superintendent involved executive duties, and I\r\nhad once again to run to St. John's, during the following summer, for\r\na meeting of the Board of Directors. With true Christian unselfishness\r\nthese men come all the way from Ottawa, New York, and Boston, to help\r\nwith their counsel so relatively unimportant a work as ours. Sir\r\nWalter Davidson again lent his heartiest coöperation. The people owe\r\nhim, Sir Herbert Murray, Sir Henry MacCallum, Sir William MacGregor,\r\nSir Ralph Williams, Sir Alexander Harris, and all the long line of\r\ntheir Governors, more than most of them realize. They bring all the\r\ninspiration of the best type of educated, widely experienced, and\r\ntravelled Englishmen to this Colony. They are specially trained and\r\nspecially selected men, and can give their counsel and leadership\r\nabsolutely untrammelled by any local prejudices.\r\n\r\nOne excellent outcome of this particular meeting was the\r\nreorganization on a larger scale of the Girls' Committee for the\r\nInstitute. The success of it has been phenomenal. Together with its\r\nprotective work it has aimed at that most difficult task of creating\r\nin them sufficient ambition to make the girls receiving very small\r\nwages want to pay for a better environment. The committee has always\r\nbeen strictly interdenominational, with Mrs. W.C. Job and Mrs. W.E.\r\nGosling as its presidents. It has made a \"show place\" of the Girls'\r\nDepartment of the Institute, and that department has become\r\nself-supporting--a most desirable goal for every philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe lumber mill and schooner building work were in slings. Our men,\r\nmade far better off by the winter work thus provided, had acquired\r\ngear so much better for fishing than their former equipment that they\r\ncould not resist engaging in the more remunerative work of the fishery\r\nin the summer months. For two years previous they had left before the\r\ndrive was complete and the logs out of the woods. Now the local\r\nmanager had also decided to fish during the three summer months--which\r\nis really the only time available for mill operations also. I was\r\nfortunate enough on my way North to persuade an expert lumber operator\r\nfrom Canada, and an entirely kindred spirit, Mr. Harry Crowe, to come\r\ndown and help me out with the problem. We spent a few delightful days\r\ntogether, in which he taught me as many things that every mill man\r\nshould know as he would have had to learn had he been dabbling in\r\npills. Like myself, Mr. Crowe is an ardent believer in Confederation\r\nwith Canada for this little country. Before Mr. Crowe's efforts on our\r\nbehalf had materialized, a new friend, Mr. Walter Booth, of New York,\r\nwell known in American football circles as one of the best of\r\nall-American forwards, came North and carried the mill for a year. The\r\none and only fault of his régime was that it was too short. The field\r\nof work was one for which he was admirably equipped, but home reasons\r\nmade him return after his time expired. He has often told me since,\r\nhowever, that he has fits of wishing that he could have put in a life\r\nwith us in the North, rather than spending it in the more civilized\r\ncircles of the New York Bar.\r\n\r\nMany invitations to speak, especially at universities in America, and\r\nthrough a lecture agency in England to numerous societies and clubs,\r\nled me to devote the winter of 1913-14 to a lecture tour. My wife\r\ninduced me also to renew my youth by a holiday of a month on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nA lecture tour includes some of the most delightful experiences of\r\nlife, bringing one into direct personal contact with so many people\r\nwhom it is a privilege to know. But it also has its anxieties and\r\nworries, and eternal vigilance is the price of avoiding a breakdown at\r\nthis the most difficult of all my work. One's memory is taxed far\r\nbeyond its capacity. To forget some things, and some people and some\r\nkindnesses, are unforgivable sins. A new host every night, a new home,\r\na new city, a new audience, alone lead one into lamentable lapses. In\r\na car full of people a man asked me one day how I liked Toledo. I\r\nreplied that I had never been there. \"Strange,\" he murmured, \"because\r\nyou spent the night at my house!\" On another occasion at a crowded\r\nreception I was talking to a lady on one side and a gentleman on the\r\nother. I had been introduced to them, but caught neither name. They\r\ndid not address each other, but only spoke to me. I felt that I must\r\nremedy matters by making them acquainted with each other, and\r\ntherefore mumbled, \"Pray let me present to you Mrs. M-m-m.\" \"Oh! no\r\nneed, Doctor,\" he replied. \"We've been married for thirty years.\"\r\nShortly after I noticed at a reception that every one wore his name\r\npinned onto his breast, and I wondered if there were any connection.\r\n\r\nIt is my invariable custom in the North to carry a water-tight box\r\nwith matches and a compass chained to my belt. One night, being tired,\r\nI had turned into bed in a very large, strange room without noting the\r\nbearings of the doors or electric switches. My faithful belt had been\r\nabandoned for pyjama strings. It so happened that to catch a train I\r\nhad to rise before daylight, and all my possessions were in a\r\ndressing-room. I soon gave up hunting for the electric light. It was\r\nsomewhere in the air, I knew, but beating the air in the dark with the\r\nwindows wide open in winter is no better fun in your nightclothes in\r\nNew York than in Labrador. A tour of inspection discovered no less\r\nthan five doors, none of which I felt entitled to enter in the dark in\r\n_déshabille_. The humour of the situation is, of course, apparent now,\r\nbut even one's dog hates to be laughed at.\r\n\r\nAn independent life has somehow left me with an instinctive dislike\r\nfor asking casual acquaintances the way to any place that I am\r\nseeking. The aversion is more or less justified by the fact that\r\noutside the police force very exceptional persons can direct you,\r\nespecially if they know the way themselves. On my first visit to New\r\nYork I could see how easy a city it was to navigate, and returned to\r\nmy host's house near Eighth Street in good time to dress for dinner\r\nafter a long side trip near Columbia University and thence to the\r\nBellevue Hospital. \"How did you find your way?\" my friend asked. \"Why,\r\nthere was sufficient sky visible to let me see the North Star,\" I\r\nanswered. I felt almost hurt when he laughed. It is natural for a\r\npolar bear not to have to inquire the way home.\r\n\r\nThe aphorism attributed to Dr. John Watson, of \"Beside the Bonnie\r\nBriar Bush,\" suggests itself. \"My fee is one hundred dollars if I go\r\nto a hotel, two hundred if I am entertained, because in the latter\r\nevent one can only live half so long.\" I conclude that he made the\r\nchoice of Achilles, for he died on a lecture tour. So far fate has\r\nbeen kinder to me.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger is the reporter, especially the emotional\r\nreporter, who has not attended your meeting. I owe such debts to the\r\npress that this statement seems the blackest of ingratitude. On the\r\ncontrary, I must plead that doctors are privileged. My controversy\r\nwith this class of reporters is their generosity, which puts into\r\none's mouth statements that on final analysis may be cold facts, but\r\nwhich, remembering that one is lecturing on work among people whom one\r\nloves and respects, it would never occur to me to slur at a public\r\nmeeting. No one who tries to alter conditions which exist can expect\r\nto escape making enemies. I have seen reports of what I have said at\r\nadvertised meetings, that were subsequently cancelled. I have followed\r\nup rumours, and editors have expressed sorrow that they accepted them\r\nfrom men who had been too busy to be present. But \"qui s'excuse,\r\ns'accuse\"; and my conclusion is that the lecturer is practically\r\ndefenceless.\r\n\r\nSince our marriage my wife has generously acted as my secretary,\r\nhaving specially learned shorthand and typewriting in order to free me\r\nfrom carrying such a burden, and has helped me enormously ever since\r\non this line. But lecture tours used to make me despair of keeping\r\nabreast of correspondence. I sometimes was forced to treat letters as\r\nHenry Drummond did--who allowed them to answer themselves--if I wished\r\nfree mornings in which to visit the hospitals, just at the time that\r\nall their professional work was in progress. These clinics are\r\ninvaluable and almost unique experiences. They persuaded me more than\r\never how much depends in surgery as well as in medicine on \"the man\r\nbehind the gun\"; and that mere mileage is not the real handicap on\r\nmembers of our profession whose fields of work lie away from the\r\ncentres of learning. They also imbued me with the profoundest spirit\r\nof respect for the leaders of the healing art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo no one but myself did it seem odd that a plain Englishman should be\r\ninvited to perform the function of best man at the wedding of the\r\ndaughter of the President of the United States of America at the White\r\nHouse. The matter was never even noticed either in the press or in\r\nconversation. The only citizen to whom I suggested the anomaly merely\r\nsaid, \"Well, why not?\"\r\n\r\nMy long-time fellow worker and one of my best of friends, Francis B.\r\nSayre, was to be married on November 25, 1913, to Miss Jessie Wilson.\r\nHer father, who, when first I had had the honour of his acquaintance,\r\nhappened to be the President of Princeton University, was now the\r\nPresident of the United States. So we had all the fun of a White House\r\nwedding. Not less than fifty of our fishermen friends from Labrador\r\nand North Newfoundland were invited, and some members of our staff\r\nwere present.\r\n\r\nWe started the wedding procession upstairs, and came down to the\r\nfanfare of uniformed trumpeters. Our awkwardness in keeping step,\r\nthough we had rehearsed the whole business several times, only\r\nrelieved the tension that must exist at so important an event in life.\r\n\r\nTrying to dodge the reporters added heaps of fun, which I am sure that\r\nthey shared, for they generally got the better of us; though the\r\nthrill of escape from the White House and Washington, so that the\r\nhoneymoon rendezvous should not be known, was practically a victory\r\nfor the wedding party. As it would never be safe to use the tactics\r\nagain, I am permitted after the lapse of many years to give them away.\r\nAs soon as dark fell, and while the guests were still revelling, the\r\nbride and groom were hustled into a secret elevator in the thickness\r\nof the wall, whisked up to the robing chambers, and completely\r\ndisguised. Meanwhile a suitable camouflage of automobiles had arrived\r\nostentatiously at the main entrance, to carry and escort the\r\nillustrious couple in fitting pomp to the great station. From the\r\nlanding the couple were dropped direct to the basement to a\r\nprearranged oubliette. The password was the sound of the wheels of an\r\nordinary cab at the kitchen entrance. The moments of suspense were not\r\nlong. At the sound of the crush on the gravel a silent door was\r\nopened, two completely muffled figures crept out, and the conspirators\r\ndrove slowly along round a few corners where a swift automobile lay\r\npanting to add _liberté_ to _égalité_ and _fraternité_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA MONTH'S HOLIDAY IN ASIA MINOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall spent in America in raising the necessary funds, it was\r\nthe now famous Carmania which carried us to England. In spite of a few\r\ndays' rest at my old home, and the stimulus of a Grenfell clan\r\ngathering in London, my wife and I were both in need of something\r\nwhich could direct our minds from our problems, and Boxing Day found\r\nus bound for Paris, Turin, Milan, and Rome.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas I had had a meeting at the famous office of the\r\nHudson Bay Company in London, and attended another of their\r\ninteresting luncheons where their directors meet. My old friend Lord\r\nStrathcona presided. I could not help noting that after all the lapse\r\nof years since we first met at Hudson Bay House in Montreal, he still\r\nretained his abstemious habits. He was ninety-three, and still at his\r\npost as High Commissioner for a great people, as well as leading\r\ncouncillor of a dozen companies. His memory of Labrador and his days\r\nthere, and his love for it, had not abated one whit. Hearing that the\r\nhospital steamer Strathcona needed a new boiler and considerable\r\nrepairs, he ordered me to have the work undertaken at once and the\r\nbill sent to him. He, moreover, insisted that we should spend some\r\ndays with him at his beautiful country house near London, an\r\ninvitation which we accepted for our return, but which we were never\r\nfated to realize, for before the appointed date that able man had\r\ncrossed the last bar.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be better to be lucky than rich. We had expected in Rome\r\nto do only what the Romans of our pocket-book do. But we fell in with\r\nsome old acquaintances whose pleasure it is to give pleasure, and New\r\nYear's night was made memorable by a concert given by the choir of the\r\nSistine Chapel, to which we were taken by the editor of the\r\n\"Churchman\" and later of the \"Constructive Quarterly,\" an old friend\r\nof ours, Dr. Silas McBee. A glimpse into the British Embassy gave us\r\nan insight into the problem of Roman modern politics and the factions\r\nof the Black and White.\r\n\r\nRome is always delightful. One is glad to forget the future and live\r\nfor the time in the past. Sitting in the Coliseum in the moonlight I\r\ncould see the gladiators fighting to amuse the civilized man of that\r\nperiod, and gentle women and innocent men dying horrible deaths for\r\ntruths that have made us what we are, but which we now sometimes\r\nregard so lightly.\r\n\r\nI confess that religious buildings, religious pictures, religious\r\nconventions of all kinds very soon pall on my particular temperament.\r\nIt is possibly a defect in my development, like my inability to\r\nappreciate classical music. On the other hand, like Mark Twain, I\r\nenjoy an ancient mummy just because he is ancient; and were it not for\r\nthe irritation of seeing so much religious display associated with\r\nsuch miserable social conditions in so beautiful a country, I should\r\nhave more sympathy with those who would \"see Rome and die.\" The\r\nsanitation of the one-time Mistress of the world suggests that it\r\ncould not be difficult to accomplish that feat in the hot weather.\r\n\r\nBrindisi is a household word in almost every English home, especially\r\none like ours with literally dozens of Anglo-Indian relatives. I was\r\ntherefore glad to pass _via_ Brindisi on the road to Athens. Patras\r\nalso had its interest to me as a distributing centre for our Labrador\r\nfish. We actually saw three forlorn-looking schooners, with cargoes\r\nfrom Newfoundland, lying in the harbour.\r\n\r\nOne poignant impression left on my mind by Greece, as well as Rome,\r\nwas its diminutive size. I almost resented the fact that a place\r\ncivilized thousands of years ago, and which had loomed up on my\r\nimagination as the land of Socrates, of Plato, of Homer, of Achilles,\r\nof Spartan warriors, and immortal poets, all seemed so small. The\r\nsense of imposition on my youth worried me.\r\n\r\nIn Athens one saw so many interesting relics within a few hundred\r\nyards that it left one with the feeling of having eaten a meal too\r\nfast. The scene of the battle of Salamis fascinated me. When we sat in\r\nXerxes' seat and conjured up the whole picture again, and saw the\r\nmeaning to the world of the great deed for which men so gladly gave\r\ntheir lives to defeat a tyrant seeking for world power, it made me\r\nlove those old Greeks, not merely admire their art.\r\n\r\nOn Mars Hill we stood on the spot where, to me, perhaps the greatest\r\nman in history, save one, pleaded with men to accept love as the only\r\ndurable source of greatness and power. But every monument, every\r\nbas-relief, every tombstone showed that the fighting man was their\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThe idea of sailing from the Piraeus reconciled us to the very mediocre\r\nvessel which carried us to Smyrna. Our visit to Asia Minor we had\r\ninadvertently timed to the opening of the International College at\r\nParadise near Smyrna. This college is the gift of Mrs. John Kennedy of\r\nNew York. Mr. Ralph Harlow, our host and a professor at the college,\r\nwith Mr. Cass Reid and other friends, made it possible for us to enjoy\r\nintelligently our brief visit. It was just a dream of pleasure. Time\r\nforbids my describing the marvellous work of that and other colleges.\r\nMen of ambition, utterly irrespective of race, colour, creed, or sect,\r\nsit side by side as the alumni. The humanity, not the other-worldliness,\r\nof the leaders has made even the Turks, steeped in the blood of their\r\ninnocent Christian subjects, recognize the untold value of these\r\nChristian universities, and kept them, their professors, and buildings,\r\nsafe during the war.\r\n\r\nDr. Bliss, of Beyrout, once told us a humorous story about himself. He\r\nhad just been addressing a large audience in New York, when\r\nimmediately after his speech the chairman rose and announced, \"We will\r\nnow sing the one hundred and fiftieth hymn, 'From the best bliss that\r\nearth imparts, we turn unfilled to Thee again.'\"\r\n\r\nThe preservation of Ephesus was a surprise to us, though of late the\r\nTurks have been carrying off its precious historic marble to burn for\r\nlime for their fields. One large marble font in an old Byzantine\r\nbaptistry was broken up for that purpose while we were there. We stood\r\non the very rostrum in the theatre where St. Paul and the coppersmith\r\nhad trouble--while at the time of our visit, the only living\r\ninhabitant of that once great city was a hungry ass which we saw\r\nharboured in a dressing-room beneath the platform.\r\n\r\nThe anachronism of buzzing along a Roman road, which had not been\r\nrepaired since the days of the Cæsars, on our way to Pergamos, in the\r\nonly Ford car in the country, was punctuated by having to get out and\r\nshove whenever we came to a cross-drain. These always went over\r\ninstead of under the road--only on an exaggerated Baltimorian plan.\r\nOne night at Soma, which is the end of the branch railroad in the\r\ndirection of Pergamos, we were in the best hotel, which, however, was\r\nonly half of it for humans. A detachment of Turkish soldiers were\r\nbilleted below in the quarters for the other animals. Snow was on the\r\nground, and it was bitterly cold. The poor soldiers slept literally on\r\nthe stone floor. We were cold, and we felt so sorry for them, that\r\nafter we had enjoyed a hot breakfast, in a fit of generosity we sent\r\nthem a couple of baskets of Turkish specialties. Later in the day we\r\nnoticed that wherever we went a Turkish soldier with a rifle followed\r\nus. So we turned off into a side street and walked out into the\r\ncountry. Sure enough the soldier came along behind. As guide to speak\r\nthe many languages for us, we had a Greek graduate of International\r\nCollege, a very delightful young fellow, very proud of a newly\r\nacquired American citizenship. At last we stopped and bribed that\r\nsoldier to tell us what the trouble was. \"Our officer thought that you\r\nmust be spies because you sent gifts to Turkish soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nAt Pergamos, a Greek Christian--very well off--invited us to be his\r\nguests on Greek Christmas Eve. It was the occasion of a large family\r\ngathering. There were fine young men and handsome, dark-eyed girls,\r\nand all the accessories of a delightful Christian home. When the outer\r\ngates had been locked, and the inner doors bolted and blinds drawn\r\ndown, and all possible loopholes examined for spies, the usual\r\nfestivities were observed. These families of the conquered race have\r\nlived in bondage some four hundred years, but their patriotism has no\r\nmore dimmed than that of ancient Israel under her oppressors. Before\r\nwe left they danced for us the famous Souliet Dance--memorial to the\r\nbrave Greek girls who, driven to their last stand on a rocky hilltop,\r\njumped one by one over the precipice as the dance came round to each\r\none, rather than submit to shame and slavery. From our friends at\r\nSmyrna we learned subsequently that when, a few months later, and just\r\nbefore the war, the German general visited the country, making\r\novertures to the Turks, the blow fell on this family like many others,\r\nand they suffered the agony of deportation.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople the kindness of Mr. Morgenthau, the American\r\nAmbassador, and the optimism bred by Robert College and the Girls'\r\nSchool, left delightful memories of even the few days in winter that\r\nwe spent there. The museum alone is worth the long journey to it, and\r\nwhen a teacher from the splendid Girls' School, herself a specialist\r\non the Hittites, was good enough to show it to us, it was like a leap\r\nback into the long history of man. It seemed but a step to the\r\nNeanderthal skull and our Troglodyte forbears.\r\n\r\nOwing to shortage of time we returned to England through Bulgaria,\r\npassing through Serbia, and stopping for a day at Budapest and two at\r\nVienna. We would have been glad to linger longer, for every hour was\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nThe month's holiday did me lots of good and sent me back to England a\r\nnew man to begin lecturing again in the interests of the distant\r\nLabrador; and with the feeling that, after all, our coast was a very\r\ngood place for one's life-work.\r\n\r\nWe helped to lessen the tedium of the lectures by doing most of the\r\ntravelling in an automobile of my brother's, in which we lived, moved,\r\nand had our meals by the roadside. The lectures took us everywhere\r\nfrom the drawing-room of a border castle on the line of the old Roman\r\nWall--which Puck of Pook's Hill had made as fascinating for us as he\r\ndid for the children--to the Embassy in Paris.\r\n\r\nOnce more the Mauretania carried us to America. April was spent partly\r\nin lecturing and partly in attending surgical clinics--a very valuable\r\nexperience being a week's work with Dr. W.R. MacAusland, of Boston, at\r\nhis orthopedic clinics in and around that city. He and his brother\r\n\"Andy\" had passed a summer with us in Labrador. May found us in Canada\r\nvisiting our helpers, and stimulating various branches by lectures.\r\nWhile loading the George B. Cluett in early June in St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland, we organized an education committee to work with the\r\nInstitute Committee, to give regular educational lectures throughout\r\nthe winter. Dr. Lloyd, our present Prime Minister, and Sir Patrick\r\nMcGrath, always a stanch friend of the Mission, helped materially in\r\nthis new activity.\r\n\r\nThe Institute at the time was housing some of the crew of the\r\nGreenland, who had come through the terrible experiences at the seal\r\nfishery in the spring of 1914. Caught on the ice in a fearful\r\nblizzard, almost all had perished miserably. Some few had survived to\r\nlose limbs and functions from frostburns. The occasion gave the\r\nInstitute one of the many opportunities for a service rather more\r\ndramatic than the routine, which did much to win it popularity.\r\n\r\nMidsummer's Day and the two following days we were stuck in a heavy\r\nice-jam one hundred miles south of St. Anthony. My wife and boys had\r\narrived in St. Anthony before me, and to find them in our own house,\r\nand the hospital full of opportunity for the line of help which I\r\nespecially enjoy, afforded all that heart could wish.\r\n\r\nEarly in July the Duke of Connaught, the Governor-General of Canada,\r\npaid us a long-promised visit. It was highly appreciated by all our\r\npeople, who would possibly have paid him more undivided attention had\r\nhe not been kind enough to send his band ashore--the first St. Anthony\r\nhad ever heard. The resplendent uniforms of the members totally\r\neclipsed that of the Duke, who was in \"mufti\"; but he readily\r\nunderstood that the division of attention was really not attributable\r\nto us. He proved to be a thorough good sport and a most democratic\r\nprince.\r\n\r\nThe war having broken out in August, we had only one idea--economy on\r\nevery side, that we might all be able to do what we could. We had not\r\nthen begun to realize the seriousness of it sufficiently to dream that\r\nwe should be welcome ourselves. We closed up all activities not\r\nentirely necessary, and even the hospital ship went into winter\r\nquarters so early that my fall trip was made from harbour to harbour\r\nin the people's own boats or by mail steamer or schooner, as\r\nopportunity offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1915, I was urged by the Harvard Surgical Unit to make\r\none of their number for their proposed term of service that winter at\r\na base hospital in France. Having discussed the matter with my\r\ndirectors, we decided that it was justifiable to postpone the lecture\r\ntour which had been arranged for me, in view of this new need.\r\n\r\nWe sailed for England on the Dutch liner New Amsterdam and landed at\r\nFalmouth, passing through a cordon of mine-sweepers and small patrols\r\nas we neared the English shores. My wife's offer to work in France not\r\nbeing accepted, since I held the rank of Major, we ran down to my old\r\nhome, where she decided to spend most of her time. My uniform and kit\r\nwere ready in a few days; and in spite of the multitudinous calls on\r\nthe War Office officials, I can say in defence of red tape that my\r\npapers were made out very quickly. I was thus able to leave promptly\r\nfor Boulogne, near which I joined the other members of my Unit, who\r\nhad preceded me by a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas and the snow was on the ground when I arrived in\r\nFrance. There was much talk of trench feet and the cold. Our life in\r\nthe North had afforded experiences more like those at the front than\r\nmost people's. We are forced to try and obtain warmth and mobility\r\ncombined with economy, especially in food and clothing. At the request\r\nof the editor, I therefore sent to the \"British Medical Journal\" a\r\nsummary of deductions from our Northern experiences. Clothes only keep\r\nheat in and damp out. Thickness, not even fur, will warm a statue, and\r\nour ideal has been to obtain light, wind-and water-proof material,\r\nand a pattern that prevents leakage of the body's heat from the neck,\r\nwrists, waist, knees, and ankles. Our skin boots, by being soft,\r\nwater-tight, and roomy, remove the causes of trench feet. Later when I\r\nreturned to England I was invited to the War Office to talk over the\r\nmatter. The defects, either in wet and cold or in hot weather, of\r\nwoolen khaki cloth are obvious, and when subsequently I visited the\r\nnaval authorities in Washington about the same subject, I was\r\ndelighted to be assured that on all small naval craft our patterns\r\nwere being exclusively used. Who introduced them did not matter.\r\n\r\nI had also advocated a removable insert of sheet steel in a pocket on\r\nthe breast of the tunic, this plate to be kept in the trenches and\r\ninserted on advancing; and a lobster-tail steel knee-piece in the\r\nknickers. Of this latter Sir Robert Jones, the British orthopedic\r\nchief, appreciated the value, knowing how many splendid men are put\r\n_hors de combat_ by tiny pieces of shell splinters infecting that\r\njoint. But the \"Journal\" censored all these references to armour. A\r\nwounded Frenchman at Berck presented me with a helmet heavily dented\r\nby shrapnel, and told me that he owed his life to it. Later at General\r\nHeadquarters, General Sir Arthur Sloggett showed me a collection of a\r\ndozen experimental helmets, each of which stood for a saved life.\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers who came under my care had a bullet wound through\r\nthe palm of his hand. I happened to ask him where his hand had been\r\nwhen hit. He said, \"On my hip. We were mending a break in our barbed\r\nwire at night, and a fixed rifle got me, exactly where it got my chum\r\njust afterwards, but it went through him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did your bullet go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nAn examination of his trousers showed the bullet in his pocket. It\r\nwas embedded in three pennies and two francs which he happened to be\r\ncarrying there, and which his wounded hand had prevented his feeling\r\nfor afterwards.\r\n\r\nPathos and humour, like genius and madness, are close akin. One of the\r\nboys told me of a chum who was very \"churchy,\" and always carried an\r\nEpiscopal Prayer Book in his pocket--for which he was not a little\r\nchaffed. For a joke one day he was presented with a second that a\r\nmessmate had received, but for which he had no use. His scruples about\r\n\"wasting it\" made him put it in his pocket with the other. Soon after\r\nthis, in an advance, he was shot in the chest. The bullet passed right\r\nthrough the first Prayer Book and lodged in the second, where it was\r\nfound on his arrival at hospital for another slight wound. He at least\r\nwill long continue to swear by the Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\nOne day, walking with other officers in the country, we stumbled\r\nacross a tiny isolated farm. As usual the voice of the inevitable\r\nTommy could be heard from within. They were tending cavalry horses,\r\nwhich filled every available nook and corner behind the lines at a\r\nperiod when cavalry was considered useless in action. Having learned\r\nthat one of these men had been body servant to a cousin of mine, who\r\nwas a V.C. at the time that he was killed, I asked him for the details\r\nof his death. The Germans had broken through on the left of his\r\ncommand, and it was instantly imperative to hold the morale while help\r\nfrom the right was summoned. Jumping on the parapet, my cousin had\r\nstood there encouraging the line amid volleys of bullets. At the same\r\ntime he ordered his servant to carry word to the right at once.\r\nSuddenly a bullet passed through his body and he fell into the trench.\r\nProtesting that he was all right, he declared that he could hold out\r\ntill the man should come back. On his return he found that my cousin\r\nwas dead. But help came, the line held, and the German attack was a\r\ncostly failure. His servant had collected and turned in all the little\r\npersonal possessions of any value which he had found on the body.\r\n\r\n\"I think that you should have got a Military Cross,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I did get an M.C.,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"It was a confinement to barracks. A bullet had smashed to pieces a\r\nlittle wrist watch which the captain always carried. It was quite\r\nvalueless, and I had kept the remnants as a memento of a man whom\r\nevery one loved. But a comrade got back at me by reporting it to\r\nheadquarters, and they had to punish me, they said.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, \"strafing\" was at a low ebb at the time that I arrived in\r\nFrance; but even I was not a bit prepared for the amount of leisure\r\ntime that our duties allowed us. There were in France hundreds of sick\r\nand wounded for every one in the lonely North; but in Labrador you are\r\nalways on the go, being often the only available doctor. Our Unit had\r\nat the time only some five hundred beds and a very strong staff, both\r\nof doctors and nurses. In spite of lending one of our colonels and\r\nseveral of our staff to other hospitals, we still had not enough beds\r\nto keep us fully occupied. It gave me ample time to help out\r\noccasionally in Y.M.C.A. activities, and to do some visiting among the\r\npoor French families and refugees in Boulogne, close to which city our\r\nhospital was located. I could also visit other Units, and give lantern\r\nshows, which had, I thought, special value when psychic treatment was\r\nbadly needed. Shell-shock was but very imperfectly understood at the\r\nbeginning of the war. The football matches and athletic sports did not\r\nneed the asset of being an antidote to shell-shock to attract my\r\npatronage. Never in my life had I realized quite so keenly what a\r\nsaving trait the sporting instinct is in the Anglo-Saxon--a strain of\r\nit in the Teuton might have even averted this war.\r\n\r\nMy stay in France enabled me to enjoy that which life on the Labrador\r\nlargely denies one--the contact with many educated minds. It was the\r\ncustom, if an officer needed a lift along the road, to hail any\r\npassing motor. While walking one day, I took advantage of this\r\nprivilege, and found myself driving with Sir Bertrand Dawson, the\r\nKing's physician, with whom I thus renewed a most valued\r\nacquaintanceship. On another occasion our host or guest might be Sir\r\nAlmroth Wright, the famous pathologist, or Sir Robert Jones would pay\r\nus a visit, or Sir Frederick Treves. In fact, we had chances to meet\r\nmany of the great leaders of our profession. Sir Arthur Lawley, the\r\nhead of our Red Cross in France, gave me some delightful evenings.\r\nUnquestionably there is an intense pleasure in hearing and seeing\r\npersonally the men who are doing things.\r\n\r\nFood grew perceptibly scarcer in Boulogne even during my stay. The\r\n_petits gâteaux_ got smaller, the hours during which officers might\r\nenter restaurants for afternoon tea became painfully shorter. But they\r\nwere not a whit less enjoyable, reminding one as they did of the dear\r\nold days, long before the war was thought of, and before the war of\r\nlife had taken me to Labrador. If one had hoped that a life in the\r\nwilds had succeeded in eradicating natural desires, those relapses in\r\nthe midst of war-time completely destroyed any such delusion. Every\r\nday was full of excitement. Bombs fell on the city only twice while I\r\nwas there, and, moreover, we were bitterly disappointed that we did\r\nnot know it till we read the news in the morning paper. But every day\r\nflying machines of all sorts sailed overhead. My interest never\r\nfailed to respond to the buzzing of some hurrying airship, or the\r\nsight of a seaplane dropping out of heaven into the water and swimming\r\ncalmly ashore, waddling up the beach into its pen exactly like a great\r\nduck.\r\n\r\nOne day it was the excitement of watching trawlers from the cliffs\r\nfiring-up mines; another, hunting along the beach among the silent\r\nevidences of some tragedy at sea, or riding convalescent horses that\r\nneeded exercise, flying along the sands to see some special sight,\r\nsuch as the carcass of a leviathan wrecked by butting into\r\nmine-fields.\r\n\r\nClose to us was a large Canadian Unit. They were changing their\r\nlocation, and for three months had been in the sorry company of those\r\nwho have no work to do. The matron, however, told me that she found\r\nplenty to occupy her time--in such a beehive of officers, with\r\nseventy-five nurses to look after.\r\n\r\nWhen at the close of the period for which I had volunteered I had to\r\ndecide whether to sign on again, my whole inclination was to stay just\r\nanother term; but as my commandant, Colonel David Cheever, informed me\r\nthat he and a number of the busier men felt that duty called them\r\nhome, and that there were plenty of volunteers to take our places, my\r\njudgment convinced me that I was more needed in Labrador.\r\n\r\nI shall not say much of the Y.M.C.A. They need no encomium of mine,\r\nbut I am prepared to stand by them to the last ditch. They were doing,\r\nnot talking, and were wise enough to use even those agents whom they\r\nknew to be imperfect, as God Himself does when He uses us. The folly\r\nof judging for all cases by one standard is common and human, but it\r\nis not God's way. This conviction was brought home to me in a very odd\r\nmanner. I had gone to lecture at an English Y.M.C.A. hut at the\r\ninvitation of the efficient director, who knew me only for a \"medical\r\nmissionary.\" On my arrival he most hospitably took me to the cupboard\r\nwhich he called \"his rooms.\" It was a raw, cold night, and among other\r\nefforts to show his gratitude for my help, to my amazement he offered\r\nme \"a drop of Scotch.\" Astonishment so outran good-breeding that I\r\nunwittingly let him perceive it. \"I am not a regular 'Y' man, Major,\"\r\nhe explained. \"I'm an Australian, and was living on my little pile\r\nwhen the war began. They turned me down each place I volunteered on\r\naccount of my age. But I was crazy to do my bit, and I offered to work\r\nwith the Y.M.C.A. as a stopgap. The War Office has commandeered so\r\nmany of their men that they had to take me to 'carry on.' I'm afraid\r\nI'm a poor apology, but I'm doing my best.\"\r\n\r\nThe freedom from convention lent another peculiar charm to the life in\r\nFrance. The mess sergeant of a headquarters where I was dining one\r\nnight, close behind the lines, presented the colonel with a\r\nbeautifully illustrated monograph on a certain unmentionable and\r\nunwelcome member of war camps and trench life. The beautiful work and\r\nthe evidences of scientific training led me to ask who the mess\r\nsergeant might have been in civil life. \"Professor of Biology at the\r\nUniversity of ----,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe most inspiring fact about the Channel ports at that time was the\r\nregularity with which steamers arrived, crowded with soldiers, and\r\nreturned with wounded. We could see England on clear days from our\r\nquarters, and could follow the boats almost across. The number of\r\ntrawlers at work all the year round, even in heavy gales that almost\r\nblew us off the cliffs, was enough to tell how vigilant a watch was\r\nbeing kept all the while. One morning only we woke to find a large\r\nstray steamer, that had entered the roads overnight, sunk across the\r\nharbour mouth, her decks awash at low water--torpedoed, we supposed.\r\nAnother day a small patrol, literally cut in half by a mine, was towed\r\nin. But though both in the air and under the sea all the ingenuity of\r\nthe enemy from as near by as Ostend was unceasingly directed against\r\nthat living stream, not one single disaster happened the whole winter\r\nthat I was out. Our mine-fields were constantly being changed. The\r\ndifferent courses the traffic took from day to day suggested that. But\r\nwho did it, and when, no one ever knew. The noise of occasional\r\nbomb-firing, once a mine rolling up on the shore, exploding and\r\nthrowing some incredibly big fragments onto the golf links, the\r\nincessant tramp of endless soldiers in the street, the ever-present\r\nbut silent motors hurrying to and fro, and the nightly arrival of\r\nconvoys of wounded, were all that reminded us that any war was in\r\nprogress. Had it been permitted, the beach would have been crowded as\r\nusual with invalids, nursemaids, and perambulators.\r\n\r\nThe second marvel was that in spite of the enormous numbers of people\r\ncoming and going, no secrets leaked out. We gave up looking for news\r\nalmost as completely as in winter in Labrador. We seemed to be shut\r\noff entirely in an eddy of the stream, as we are in our Northern\r\nwastes.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of humour in the wounded Briton was as invaluable as the\r\nlove of sport when he is well. On one occasion a small party were\r\ngoing to relieve a section of the line. The Boches had the range of a\r\npiece of the road over which they had to pass, and the men made dashes\r\nsingly or in small numbers across it. A lad, a well-known athlete, was\r\ncaught by a shell and blown over a hedge into a field. When they\r\nreached him, his leg was gone and one arm badly smashed. He was\r\nsitting up smoking a cigarette, and all he said was, \"Well, I fancy\r\nthat's the end of my football days.\" One very undeveloped man, who had\r\nsomehow leaked into Kitchener's Army, told me, \"Well, you see, Major,\r\nI was a bit too weak for a labouring man, so I joined the army. I\r\nthought it might do my 'ealth good!\" One of the English papers\r\nreported that when a small Gospel was sent by post to a prisoner in\r\nGermany the Teuton official stamped every page, \"Passed by the\r\nCensor.\"\r\n\r\nThe practice of listening to the yarns of the wounded was much\r\ndiscouraged, chiefly for one's own sake, for their knowledge was less\r\naccurate than our own, while shell-shock led them to imagine more. The\r\ncensor had always good yarns to tell. The men showed generally much\r\ngood-humour and a universal light-heartedness. Our wounded hardly ever\r\n\"groused.\" They hid their troubles and cheered their families, seldom\r\nor never by pious sentiments. One man writing from a regimental camp\r\nclose to Boulogne, after a painfully uneventful Channel crossing,\r\nannounced, \"Here we are in the enemies' country right under the\r\nmuzzles of the guns. We got over quite safely, though three submarines\r\nchased us and shelled us all the way. Food here is very short. I\r\nhaven't looked at a bun for weeks. A bit more of that cake of yours\r\nwould do nicely, not to talk o' smokes. Your loving husband.\" Another\r\nletter was quoted in the \"Daily Mail.\" It ran: \"Dear Mother--This\r\ncomes hoping that it may find you as it leaves me at present. I have a\r\nbroken leg, and a bullet in my left lung. Your affectionate son.\"\r\n\r\nYet the men were far from fatalists, and the psychic stimulus of being\r\nable to tell your patient that he was ordered to \"Blighty\" was\r\ndemonstrable on his history chart. One poor fellow whose right arm was\r\ninfected with gas bacillus was so anxious to save it that we left it\r\non too long and general blood poisoning set in. He was on the dying\r\nlist. The Government under these circumstances would pay the expenses\r\nof a wife or mother to come over and say the last good-bye. After the\r\nmessage went, it seemed that our friend could not last till their\r\narrival, and the colonel decided as a last chance to try intra-venous\r\ninjections of Eusol, the powerful antiseptic in use at that time in\r\nall the hospitals. On entering the ward the next morning the nurse\r\ntold me with a smiling face, \"B. is ever so much better. I think that\r\nhe will pull through all right.\" \"Then the Eusol injection has done\r\ngood, I suppose?\" \"His wife and mother came last night and sat up with\r\nhim\"--and I saw a twinkle in the corner of her eye. Eusol injections\r\nare now considered inert.\r\n\r\nWith so many patients who only remained so short a time, there was an\r\ninevitable tendency to relapse into treating men as \"cases,\" not as\r\nbrothers. To get through their exterior needed tact and experience.\r\nBut if love is a force stronger than bayonets and guns, it certainly\r\nhas its place in modern--and all time--surgery. I have a shrewd\r\nsuspicion that it is better worth exhibiting than quite a number of\r\nthe drugs still on the world's pharmacopoeias. Many of the nurses kept\r\nvisitors' books, and in these their patients were asked to write their\r\nnames or anything they liked. The little fact made them feel more at\r\nhome, as if some person really cared for them. One could not help\r\nnoticing how many of them broke out into verse, though most of them\r\nwere labouring men at home. Although some was not original, it showed\r\nthat they liked poetry. Some was extempore, as the following:\r\n\r\n    \"Good-bye, dear mother, sister, brother,\r\n    Drive away those bitter tears.\r\n    For England's in no danger\r\n    While there are bomb throwers in the Tenth Royal Fusiliers.\"\r\n\r\nThe following effusion I think was doubtless evolved gradually. It\r\nruns:\r\n\r\n    \"There's a little dug-out in a trench,\r\n    Which the rainstorms continually drench.\r\n    With the sky overhead, and a stone for a bed,\r\n    And another that acts for a bench.\r\n\r\n    \"It's hard bread and cold bully we chew;\r\n    It is months since we've tasted a stew;\r\n    And the Jack Johnsons flare through the cold wintry air,\r\n    O'er my little wet home in the trench.\r\n\r\n    \"So hurrah for the mud and the clay,\r\n    Which leads to 'der Tag,' that's the day\r\n    When we enter Berlin, that city of sin,\r\n    And make the fat Berliners pay.\"\r\n\r\nI have never been in any sense what is generally understood by the\r\nterm \"faith healer,\" but I am certain that you can make a new man out\r\nof an old one, can save a man who is losing ground, and turn the\r\nbalance and help him to win out through psychic agencies when all our\r\nchemical stimulants are only doing harm. That seemed especially true\r\nin those put _hors de combat_ by the almost superhuman horrors of this\r\nwar. It seemed to me to pay especially to get the confidence of one's\r\npatients. Thus one man would be drawn out by the gift of a few\r\nflowers, a little fruit, cigarettes, as so many of the kindly visitors\r\ndiscovered. One man with shrapnel splinters in his abdomen expressed a\r\ncraving for Worcester sauce. It appeared to him so unobtainable in a\r\nhospital in France. From the point of view of his recovery I am\r\nconvinced that the bottle which we procured in Boulogne was a good\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nWe eagerly awaited the illustrated papers each week for the same\r\nreason. But personal interest shown in themselves, by the time spared\r\nfor chatting, was far the most appreciated. We had been very rightly\r\nwarned against listening to the wounded men. It was with them in the\r\nbase hospitals that the story of the angels of Mons originated. I\r\nnever met any one personally who saw anything nearer the supernatural\r\nthan that marvellous fight itself--the pluck and endurance of our\r\n\"contemptible little army.\" But some claimed to have seen a spirit but\r\nvisible army, such as Elijah at Dothan showed to his servant, or\r\nCastor and Pollux at Lake Regillus, fighting in front of our lines. A\r\nCanadian in command of the C.A.M.C. contingent, who treated thousands\r\nof the wounded as they came back from the front, told me that early in\r\nthe day he heard the rumour, and ordered his men to ask as many as\r\npossible if they had seen any such phenomenon. Not one claimed to have\r\ndone so. Yet a few days later from the base he heard a great many of\r\nthese same men had declared that they had seen the \"angels.\" He\r\nconsidered that the whole matter arose originally through some\r\nhysterical woman, and then was augmented by the suggestion of the\r\nquestion which he himself had put to them, made to men shell-shocked\r\nand in abnormal mental conditions.\r\n\r\nAmong other deductions from voluminous notes I judged that the Saxons\r\nreally did not want to fight, the impression coming from so many\r\ndifferent sources. Some said that they let us know, shouting across\r\n\"No Man's Land,\" that they did not wish to fight, that they were\r\nChristians, had wives and children of their own, that they did not\r\nwant to kill any one, and would fire in the air when forced to fire,\r\nwere keen to renew the Christmas \"pour-parlers.\" Our men claimed that\r\nit was comparative peace when the Saxons were in the trenches\r\nopposite, and they made friendly overtures as often as they dared.\r\nThey were capable of attributing honour to others, and those who came\r\nover into our lines asserted that hundreds were anxious to do so, only\r\nthey were so watched from behind. Moreover, the outrages committed by\r\nthe Prussians under flags of truce had made it impossible for our men\r\nto allow any one to approach. To sit opposite a Saxon regiment for a\r\nmonth and not exchange shots appeared to be not uncommon. One man told\r\nme that they poked up a notice on their bayonets saying, \"We are not\r\ngoing to fight\"; and another said that once when \"strafing\" somehow\r\ncommenced, they shouted from the opposite trenches: \"Save your\r\nbullets. You'll need them to-night when the Prussian Guard relieves\r\nus\"--which proved perfectly true. One day an elderly man crawled out\r\nof their trench, came to our barbed wire, and called out for bread. We\r\nthrew him a loaf. He wrapped up something in his cap and threw it\r\nover. We tossed it back with more bread, but when he went back he left\r\nthe watch behind.\r\n\r\nAfter an especially brutal piece of treachery, our men were too\r\nmaddened to give quarter, and one said, \"A Saxon might have had a\r\nchance with us even then, but a Prussian would have had about as\r\nlittle as a beetle at a woodpecker's prayer meeting!\" The Saxons, on\r\nthe other hand, displayed the individual courage of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nthat helped to lessen our losses by enabling us to attack in open\r\nformation. Every animal will fight when forced to do so. The cowardly\r\nwolf will attack only in packs; and one of the main reasons for the\r\nwholesale holocausts of mass attacks seems to have been that same lack\r\nof real courage in the boastful and militarist element. He dare not\r\nadvance alone.\r\n\r\nA colonel in command at the first battle of the Aisne described to me\r\nan incident that I at least did not hear elsewhere. He said that the\r\nGermans opposite him came on sixteen abreast, arm in arm, rifles at\r\nthe trail or held anyhow. They were singing wildly, and literally\r\njumping up and down, as if dancing. Fire was reserved till they came\r\nwithin a few hundred yards, when machine guns started to mow them\r\ndown. Hay-pooks, or rather man-pooks, were immediately formed, and the\r\nadvancing column, instead of coming straight on, went round and round\r\nthe ever-increasing stacks. He believed that they had been filled with\r\ntoo much dope or too much doctored grog of some kind.\r\n\r\nIt was my great desire before returning from France to see the\r\nconditions at the front. I was told that members of American Units\r\nwere discouraged from visiting the trenches. Dr. Carrel had twice most\r\nkindly invited me to Compiègne to see his new work on wounds, but\r\npermission to accept had been denied me. Being a British subject and\r\nwearing a British decoration on an American uniform only seemed to\r\nworry the authorities. I had almost abandoned hope, when one day an\r\nautomobile stopped at our headquarters, just at the close of my term\r\nof service, and a colonel, a distinguished scientist, jumped out. He\r\ntold me if I could get to Medical Headquarters, then at St. Omer, he\r\ncould arrange for me to visit each of the four armies I wished to see.\r\nI had no permission to leave the base, though my term of service\r\nexpired the next day. I had no passes, and our British commandant\r\nwould not on his own responsibility either give me leave or lend me\r\nthe necessary outfit. He would only agree to look the other way if I\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nPassing the sentries was not difficult, but once arrived in St. Omer,\r\nit was essential to have permission from Headquarters before one could\r\nenter any house or hotel. I was accordingly dumped in the dark streets\r\nof a strange town and told to be at that exact spot again in two\r\nhours, waiting my sponsor's return. Nor did he say where he was going,\r\nin case we failed to meet, for no one was allowed to mention the\r\nwhereabouts of the G.H.Q. After two hours were over, I was at the\r\nappointed spot with that pleasurable sense of excitement that seldom\r\ncomes after one has settled down in life. I could then understand\r\nbetter how a spy must feel. The town naturally was unlit for fear of\r\naircraft, and yet there was a queer feeling that every one was looking\r\nat you as you walked up and down in the dark. My colonel friend was at\r\nthe rendezvous with all the precision of a soldier, not only with the\r\nnecessary papers and arrangements for the tour of inspection, but also\r\na genial invitation to dine at Headquarters. General Sir Arthur\r\nSloggett and his exceedingly able staff opened my eyes very\r\nconsiderably before the evening was out as to the methods of the\r\nR.A.M.C. in war-time. It was such a revelation to me that I felt it\r\nwould be an infinite comfort to those with loved ones in the trenches\r\nto realize how marvellously efficient the provision for the care of\r\nthe soldier's health had become. The main impression on my mind was\r\nthe extraordinary developments since the days of the Lady of the Lamp.\r\nFormerly, so long as he was fit to fight, the soldier was always\r\nlooked after. Now the soldier unfit to fight had exactly the same\r\nrights, just as after the war let us trust that the broken soldier\r\nwill be \"seen through\" back into civil life. I was honestly surprised\r\nthat he no longer depended on voluntary gifts to a charitable society\r\nfor a bandage when he lay wounded or for a nurse if sickness overtook\r\nhim. The marvellous system of the medical intelligence department,\r\neven the separate medical secret service, worked so efficiently that\r\nin spite of the awful conditions the health of the men in the line was\r\ntwice as good as that when at home in civil life. Even disease\r\napproaching from the enemy's side was \"spied,\" and as far as possible\r\nforestalled. All sanitary arrangements, all water supplies, and all\r\npublic health matters from the North Sea to the Swiss border were\r\nhandled by regular army officers. For the first time in history the\r\nmedicals were considered so intimate a part of the fighting force that\r\ndoctors held the same rank as executive officers. I was a major--no\r\nlonger a surgeon major or just a sanitary official. Those in command\r\nwere even trusted in advance with information as to what would likely\r\nbe required of them on any part of the front by some manoeuvre or\r\nattack, though I do not think that even the general of the R.A.M.C.\r\nwas admitted to the council of war.\r\n\r\nThe chart-room of the G.H.Q. was another revelation. The walls from\r\nceiling to floor were occupied with the usual large-scale maps, with\r\nflags on pins; while long, weird, crooked lines of all colours made\r\nelaborate tracings over the charts, like those used in hospitals.\r\nThese flags and lines indicated the surgical and medical front, where\r\nbattles with typhoid, trench feet, and wounds were being waged by the\r\nimmense army of workers under General Sloggett's direction.\r\nLaboratories in motor cars, special surgeons and ambulances were\r\nracing here and there, new hospitals for emergencies were being pushed\r\nin different directions, so that though within range of the enemies'\r\nguns, men wounded in the chest or abdomen could be treated in time to\r\ngive them a chance for their lives. Typhoid recurring in any section\r\nof the line might mean the reprimand of the medical officer there;\r\ntrench feet became a misdemeanour, so excellent were the precautions\r\ndevised and carried out by the N.C.O.'s.\r\n\r\nI ventured at table to say quite truthfully that I, a surgeon from a\r\nbase hospital, where we saw endless Red Cross motor ambulances, and\r\nreceived so many kindnesses in supplies, and especially luxuries for\r\nour wounded from the Red Cross officials, had been under the\r\nimpression that the R.A.M.C. was a sort of small tail to a very large\r\nRed Cross kite, owing to our little army and general unpreparedness\r\nwhen the war broke out. I could see that to my surprised hosts I\r\nappeared to be mentally deficient, but I was able to assure them that\r\nthere were tens of thousands who knew even less than that, and thought\r\nthat the chances still were that if their loved ones were hurt, they\r\nmight be left to die because some one had not given their annual\r\ncontribution to a society. It seemed a very serious omission that the\r\npublic had not the information that would carry so much consolation\r\nwith it. The British Red Cross has every one's love and support, but\r\nits function in war, as one officer said, must increasingly become, in\r\nrelation to the R.A.M.C., that of a Sunday-school treat to the staff\r\nof the school.\r\n\r\nThe officialdom of Germany and even of France had always contrasted\r\nvery unfavourably in my mind with our English methods. I was surprised\r\nin America that so many hospitals were Government institutions, and\r\nyet worked so well.\r\n\r\nAt Melville we turned aside to inspect what was apparently a second\r\nValley of Hinnom. It was a series of furnaces, built out of clay and\r\nold cans, efficiently disposing of the garbage of a town and a large\r\nsection of the line. At West Outre an officer found time to show us\r\nhis ingenious improvised laundry. His share was to fight the enemy by\r\nkeeping our boys decently clean; and for this purpose he collected\r\ntheir dirty linen into huge piles. He had diverted the only available\r\nbrook so as to put a portable building over it. His battalion\r\nconsisted of the whole female strength of the country-side, and had\r\nto be prepared to advance or retire _pari passu_ with the other\r\nfighters. The chattering, shouting crowd, almost invisible in the fog\r\nof steam as we walked through, made me realize how difficult a command\r\nthis regiment of washerwomen constituted. The triumph was that they\r\nall appeared to be contented and fraternal.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows one of the worst problems of the trenches was\r\nvermin. We entered a huge building used in peace-time for the purposes\r\nof dyeing. A Jack Johnson had only just exploded in the moat that\r\nbrought the water to the tanks, but provision was made for trifles of\r\nthis kind. When we peered over the edge of a steaming vat, it was to\r\ndiscover a platoon of Tommies enjoying the \"time of their lives,\"\r\nbefore they joined the line of naked beings, each scrubbing the now\r\nhappy man ahead. An endless stream of garments advanced through\r\nelectric superheaters in parallel columns. There seemed as much\r\nexcitement about the chance of every man getting his own clothing back\r\nas there is in the bran pie at a children's Christmas party.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting the mud and squalor of a front trench in Flanders, only\r\na few yards from the enemy's lines, the cheery occupants offered to\r\nbrew some tea, exactly as we \"boil our kettle\" and have a good time in\r\nthe safety of our Northern backwoods. One day I picked up some bright\r\nblue crystals. They proved to be \"blue-stone,\" or sulphate of copper.\r\nWhen my pilot noticed that its presence puzzled me, he remarked\r\ncasually, \"There was a regimental dressing-station there a day or so\r\nago. Probably that is the remains of it.\"\r\n\r\nOn a siding at Calais station a veritable pyramid of filth met my\r\neyes. On inspection it proved to be odd old boots dug from the mud of\r\nthe battle-fields, and, sorted out from the other endless piles of\r\ndébris, brought back as salvage. To attack one pair of such boots is\r\ndepressing. Melancholia alone befitted the pile. Yet I saw close at\r\nhand, through a series of sheds, this polluted current entering and\r\ncoming out at the other end new boots, at the rate of a thousand pairs\r\na day--the talisman not being a Henry Ford of boot-making, but just a\r\nsmiling English colonel in the sporting trousers of a mounted officer.\r\n\r\nThe ground was still under snow, and we drove over much ice and\r\nthrough much slush as we returned to our base at Boulogne. My\r\ncolleagues had gone back to America and it was a terribly lonely\r\njourney to London, though both steamer and train were crowded. The war\r\nwas not yet won, and I could not help feeling an intense desire to\r\nremain and see it through with the brave, generous-hearted men who\r\nwere giving their lives for our sakes. Loneliness scarcely describes\r\nmy sensations; it felt more like desertion. One road to despair would\r\nbe the awful realization that one is not wanted. The work looming\r\nahead was the only comforting element, with the knowledge that the\r\nbest of wives and partners was waiting in London to help me out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nFORWARD STEPS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy return to the work after serving in France was embittered by a\r\nviolent attack made upon me in a St. John's paper. It was called forth\r\nby a report of a lecture in Montreal where I had addressed the\r\nCanadian Club. The meeting was organized by Newfoundlanders at the\r\nRitz Carlton Hotel, and the fact that a large number from the Colony\r\nwere present and moved the vote of thanks at the end should have been\r\nsufficient guarantee of the _bona fides_ of my statements. But the\r\nover-enthusiastic account of a reporter who unfortunately was not\r\npresent gave my critics the chance for which they were looking. It was\r\nat a time when any criticism whatever of a country that was responding\r\nso generously to the homeland's call for help would have been\r\nimpolitic, even if true. It subsequently proved one factor, however,\r\nin obtaining the commission of inquiry from the Government, and so far\r\nwas really a blessing to our work. In retrospect it is easy to see\r\nthat all things work together for good, but at the time, oddly enough,\r\neven if such reports are absolutely false, they hurt more than the\r\npoint of a good steel knife. Anonymous letters, on the contrary, with\r\nwhich form of correspondence I have a bowing acquaintance, only\r\ndisturb the waste-paper basket.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, the representatives of our Council, the Honourable\r\nRobert Watson and the Honourable W.C. Job, and my many other fast\r\nfriends, however, soon made it possible for me to forget the matter.\r\nIf protest breeds opposition, it in turn begets apposition, and a\r\ngood line of demarcation--a \"no man's land\" between friend and\r\nfoe--and gives a healthy atmosphere in so-called times of peace.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1915 a large coöperative store was established at Cape\r\nCharles near Battle Harbour, which bred such opposition amongst\r\ncertain merchants that it proved instrumental also in obtaining for us\r\nthe Government commission of inquiry sent down a few months later.\r\nAfter a thorough investigation of St. Anthony, Battle Harbour, Cape\r\nCharles, Forteau, Red Bay, and Flowers Cove, summoning every possible\r\nwitness and tracing all rumours to their source, the commissioners'\r\nfindings were so favourable to the Mission that on their return to St.\r\nJohn's our still undaunted detractors could only attribute it to\r\nsupernatural agencies.\r\n\r\nMy colleague at Battle Harbour, Dr. John Grieve, who with his wife had\r\nalready given us so many years' work there, and whose interest in the\r\ncoöperative effort at Cape Charles was responsible for its initial\r\nsuccess, had worked out a plan for a winter hospital station in Lewis\r\nBay, and had surveyed the necessary land grant. Through the\r\nresignation of our business manager, Mr. Sheard, and the selection of\r\nDr. Grieve by the directors as his successor, only that part of the\r\nLewis Bay scheme which enables us to give work in winter providing\r\nwood supplies has so far materialized.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 also, at a place called Northwest River, one hundred and\r\nthirty miles up Hamilton Inlet from Indian Harbour, a little cottage\r\nhospital and doctor's house combined was built, called the \"Emily\r\nBeaver Chamberlain Memorial Hospital.\" Thus the work of Dr. and Mrs.\r\nPaddon has been converted into a continuous service, for formerly when\r\nIndian Harbour Hospital was closed in the fall, they had no place in\r\nwhich they could efficiently carry on their work during the winter\r\nmonths. Before Dr. Paddon came to the coast, Dr. and Mrs. Norman\r\nStewart gave us several years of valuable service, spending their\r\nsummers at Indian Harbour and returning for the winter to St. Anthony,\r\naccording to my original plan when I first built St. Anthony Hospital.\r\n\r\nAn old friend and worker at St. Anthony, Mr. John Evans of\r\nPhiladelphia, who had helped us with our deer and other problems,\r\nhaving married our head nurse, the first whom we had ever had from\r\nNewfoundland, found it essential to return and take up remunerative\r\nwork at home.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of patients seeking help at St. Anthony made it\r\nnecessary to provide proportionately increasing facilities. As I have\r\nstated elsewhere, the sister of my splendid colleague, Dr. Little, in\r\n1909 had raised the money for the new wing of the hospital for the\r\naccommodation of the summer accession of patients. The clinic which\r\nhad now grown so tremendously, due to Dr. Little's magnificent work,\r\nwas maintaining a permanent house surgeon, Dr. Louis Fallen, who had\r\nfaithfully served the Mission at different times at other stations. We\r\nhad also regular dental and eye departments.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1917 was saddened for us all by the loss to the work of\r\nmy beloved and able colleague, Dr. John Mason Little, Jr., who had\r\ngiven ten years of most valuable labour to the people of this coast.\r\nHe had married, some years before, our delightful and unselfish\r\nhelper, Miss Ruth Keese, and they now had four little children growing\r\nup in St. Anthony. The education of his family and the call of other\r\nhome ties made him feel that it had become essential for him to\r\nterminate his more intimate connection with the North, and he left us\r\nto take up medical work in Boston. The loss of them both was a very\r\nheavy one to the work and to us personally, and we are only thankful\r\nthat we have been able to secure Dr. Little's invaluable assistance\r\nand advice on our Board of Directors in Boston. This coast and this\r\nhospital owe him a tremendous debt which can never be repaid, for it\r\nwas he who put this clinic in a position to hold up its head among the\r\nbest of medical work, and offer to this far-off people the grade of\r\nskilled assistance which we should wish for our loved ones if they\r\nwere ill or in trouble. For Dr. Little offered not only his very\r\nexceptional skill as a surgeon, but also the gift of his inspiring and\r\ndevoted personality.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1917-18 was extremely severe, not only in our North\r\ncountry, but in the United States and Canada also. I was lecturing\r\nduring this winter in both these latter countries, though during the\r\nmonths of December and January travelling became very difficult owing\r\nto the continuous blizzards. I was held up for three days in Racine,\r\nWisconsin, as neither trains, electric cars, or automobiles could make\r\ntheir way through the heavy drifts. Had I had my trusty dog team,\r\nhowever, I should not have missed three important lecture engagements.\r\nLife in the North has its compensations.\r\n\r\nAt Toronto I was unfortunate enough to contract bronchitis and\r\npleurisy, and I understand from competent observers that I was an\r\n\"impossible patient.\" Be that as it may, so much pressure was brought\r\nto bear on me that at last I was forced to obey the doctors and leave\r\nfor a month's rest in a warmer climate.\r\n\r\nOwing to ice and war conditions we did not arrive in St. Anthony until\r\nthe first of July. In arriving late we were all spared a terrible\r\nshock. The previous day some of the boys from the Orphanage had gone\r\nfishing in the Devil's Pond, about a mile away, and a favourite\r\nresort with them. Unfortunately that afternoon they were seized\r\nwith the brilliant idea of kindling a fire with which to cook their\r\ntrout. Greatly to the astonishment of the would-be cooks, the fire\r\nquickly got beyond the one desired for culinary purposes, and,\r\npanic-stricken, they rushed home to give the alarm. Every man ashore\r\nand afloat came and worked, and the obliteration of the place was\r\nsaved by a providential change in the wind and wide fire-breaks cut\r\nthrough few and ill-to-be-spared trees. Everything had been taken from\r\nour house--even furniture and linen--and dragged to the wharf head,\r\nwhere terrified children, fleeing patients, and heaps of furnishings\r\nfrom the orphanage and elsewhere were all piled up. Schooners had been\r\nhauled in to carry off what was possible, and the patients in the\r\nhospital were got ready to be carried away at a moment's notice. Only\r\nthe most strenuous efforts saved the entire station. Now all our\r\nbeautiful sky-line is blackened and charred. All day long the gravity\r\nof the debt was in our hearts, for if the wooden buildings had once\r\nhad the clouds of fiery sparks settle upon them, the whole of those\r\ndependent upon us would have been homeless. Surely in a country like\r\nthis, the incident of this fire puts an added emphasis upon our need\r\nof brick buildings. Gratitude for our safe return, for all God's\r\nmercies to us, and joy over the outcome of the at one time apparently\r\ninevitable disaster, made our first day of the season a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten event.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE LABRADOR DOCTOR IN WINTER]\r\n\r\nMr. W.R. Stirling, our Chicago director, who had personally visited\r\nthe hospitals, insisted that a water supply must at all costs be\r\nsecured both for hospital and orphanage. This was not only to avert\r\nthe reproach of typhoid epidemics, two of which had previously\r\noccurred, but also to better our protection for so many helpless lives\r\nin old dry wooden buildings, and to economize the great expense of\r\nhauling water by dogs every winter, when our little surface reservoir\r\nwas frozen to the bottom. This water supply has only just been\r\nfinished; and now we cannot understand how we ever existed without it.\r\nBut it is an unromantic object to which to give money, and the total\r\ncost, even doing the work ourselves, amounted to just upon ten\r\nthousand dollars. According to the Government engineer's advice we had\r\na stream to dam and a mile and a quarter of piping to lay six feet\r\nunderground to prevent the water freezing. It is only in very few\r\nplaces that we boast six feet of soil at all on the rock that forms\r\nthe frame of Mother Earth here. Hence there was much blasting to do.\r\nBut the task was accomplished, and by our own boys, and has\r\nsuccessfully weathered our bitter winter. The last lap was run by an\r\nintensely interesting experiment. The assistant at Emmanuel Church in\r\nBoston brought down a number of volunteer Boy Scouts to give their\r\nservices on the commonplace task of digging the remainder of the\r\ntrench necessary to complete the water supply. When they first\r\narrived, our Northern outside man, after looking at their clothes of\r\nthe Boston cut, remarked, \"Hm. You'd better give that crowd some\r\nsofter job than digging.\" But they did the work, and a whole lot more\r\nbesides. For their grit and jollity, and above all their readiness to\r\ntackle and see through such side tasks as unloading and stowing away\r\nsome three hundred tons of coal were real \"missionary\" lessons.\r\n\r\nThe ever-growing demand for doctors as the war dragged on made it\r\nharder and harder to man our far-off stations. The draft in America\r\nwas the last straw, doctors having already been forbidden to leave\r\nEngland or Canada. Dr. Charles Curtis had taken over Dr. Little's work\r\nat St. Anthony, and stood nobly by, getting special permission to do\r\nso. Dr. West, who had succeeded our colleague, Dr. Mather Hare, at\r\nHarrington, when his wife's breakdown had obliged him to leave us, had\r\nalready given us a year over his scheduled time, for he had accepted\r\nwork in India at the hands of those who had specially trained him for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nWe had been having considerable trouble in the accommodation of the\r\nheavy batches of patients that came by the mail boat. They were left\r\non the wharf when she steamed away, and only the floors of our\r\ntreatment and waiting-rooms were available for their reception. For\r\nall could not possibly go into the wards, where children, and often\r\nvery sick patients, were being cared for. The people around always\r\nstretched their hospitality to the limit, but this was a very\r\nundesirable method of housing sick persons temporarily. Owing to the\r\ngenerosity of a lady in New Bedford and other friends, we were enabled\r\nto meet the problem by the erection of a rest house, with first and\r\nsecond class accommodation. This was built in the spring of 1917, and\r\nhas been a Godsend to many besides patients. It makes people free to\r\ncome to St. Anthony and stay and benefit by whatever it has to offer,\r\nwithout the feeling that they have no place to which they can go.\r\nMoreover, this hostel has been entirely self-supporting from the day\r\nthat it opened, and every one who goes and comes has a good word for\r\nthe rest house. It is run by one of our Labrador orphan boys, whose\r\neducation was finished in America, and \"Johnnie,\" as every one calls\r\nhim, is already a feature in the life of the place.\r\n\r\nAmong the advances of the year 1918 must also be noted that more\r\nsubscribers and subscriptions from local friends have been received\r\nthan ever before. Our X-ray department has been added to. We have been\r\nable also to improve the roads, a thing greatly to be desired.\r\n\r\nLook where we will, we have nothing but gratitude that in the last\r\nyear of a long and exhausting war, here in this far-away section of\r\nthe world, the keynote has been one of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF THE MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the future of this Mission? I have once or twice been an\r\nunwilling listener to a discussion on this point. It has usually been\r\nin the smoking-room of a local mail steamer. The subtle humour of W.W.\r\nJacobs has shown us that pessimism is an attribute of the village\r\n\"pub\" also. The alcoholic is always a prophet of doom; and the wish is\r\noften father to the thought.\r\n\r\nIn our medical work in the wilds we have become a repository of some\r\nold instruments discarded on the death of their owners or cast aside\r\nby the advancing tide of knowledge. Seeing the ingenuity, time, and\r\nexpense lavished on many of them, they would make a truly pathetic\r\nmuseum. Personally I prefer the habits of India to those of Egypt\r\nconcerning the departed. If the Pharaoh of the Persecution could see\r\nhis mummy being shown to tourists as a cheap side show, I am sure that\r\nhe would vote for cremation if he had the choice over again.\r\n\r\nIt sounds flippant in one who has devoted his life to this work to\r\nsay, \"Really I don't care what its future may be.\" I am content to\r\nleave the future with God. No true sportsman wants to linger on, a\r\nwretched handicap to the cause for which he once stood, like a fake\r\nhero with his peg leg and a black patch over one eye. The Christian\r\nchoice is that of Achilles. Nature also teaches us that the paths of\r\nprogress are marked by the discarded relics of what once were her\r\ncorner-stones. The original Moses had the spirit of Christ when he\r\nsaid, \"If Thou wilt, forgive their sin--and if not, I pray Thee, blot\r\nme out of Thy book.\" The heroic Paul was willing to be eliminated for\r\nthe Kingdom of God. It seems to me that that attitude is the only\r\ncredential which any Christian mission can give for its existence. If\r\nI felt that my work had accomplished all it could, I would \"lay it\r\ndown with a will.\"\r\n\r\nAs in India and China the missionaries of the various societies are\r\nuniting to build up a native, national Church which would wish to\r\nassume the responsibility of caring for its own problems, so when the\r\nGovernment of this country is willing and able to take over the\r\nmaintenance of the medical work, this Mission would have justified its\r\nexistence by its elimination. All lines along which the Mission works\r\nshould one day become self-eliminating. Until that time arrives I am\r\nsatisfied that the Mission has great opportunities before it. I am an\r\noptimist, and feel certain that God will provide the means to continue\r\nas long as the need exists.\r\n\r\nSome believe that the future of this population depends solely on the\r\nattention paid to the development of the resources of the coast. Not\r\nonly are its raw products more needed than ever, but even supposing\r\nthat unscientific handling of them has depleted the supply, still\r\nthere is ample to maintain a larger population than at present. This\r\ncan only be when science and capital are introduced here, combined\r\nwith an educated manhood fired by the spirit of coöperation.\r\n\r\nIn large parts of China a famine to wipe out surplus population is\r\napparently a periodical necessity. An orphanage in India for similar\r\nreasons does not seem to be as rationally economic as one for the\r\nLabrador children. I never see a cliff face from which an avalanche\r\nhas removed the supersoil and herbage without thinking in pity of the\r\ncrowded sections of China, where tearing up even the roots of trees\r\nfor fuel has permitted so much arable land to be denuded by rains\r\nthat the food supply gets smaller while the population grows larger.\r\n\r\nThe future of all medical work depends on whether people want it and\r\ncan arrange to get it paid for. If all the world become Christian\r\nScientists, scientific--which we believe to be also Christian--healing\r\nwill everywhere die a natural death--and possibly the people also. But\r\nhistory suggests that the healing art is one of considerable vitality.\r\nMy own belief is that in the apparently approaching socialistic age,\r\nmedicine will be communized and provided by the State free to all. If\r\neducation for the mind is, why not education for the body?\r\n\r\nCertain subtle and very vital psychic influences are probably the best\r\nstock in trade of the \"Doctor of the old school.\" These qualities\r\nappear at present less likely to be \"had for hire\" in a Government\r\nofficial. The Chinese may yet return the missionary compliment by\r\nteaching us to adopt their method of paying the doctor only when and\r\nas long as the patient is cured.\r\n\r\nOut of the taxes, the major part of which is paid by the people of the\r\noutport districts in this Colony, the Government provides free medical\r\naid in the Capital, presumably because those who have the spending of\r\nthe money mostly reside there. The Mission provides it in the farthest\r\noff and poorest part of the country, Labrador and North Newfoundland,\r\nbecause there is no chance whatever at present for the poor people to\r\nobtain it otherwise. Our _pro rata_ share of the taxes, if judged by\r\nthe paltry Government grant toward the work, would not provide\r\nanything worth having. The people here pay far better in proportion to\r\ntheir ability for hospital privileges than they do in Boston or\r\nLondon; the Government pays a little, and the rest comes from the\r\nloving gifts of those who desire nothing better, when they know of\r\nreal need, than to make sacrifices to meet it.\r\n\r\nOne feels that the Chinese and Japanese and all nations will be able\r\nsome day to pay for their own doctors, whether they do it on\r\nindividualistic or communistic principles. In the present state of the\r\nworld I believe the missionary enterprise to be entirely desirable, or\r\nI would not be where I am. But being a Christian with a little faith,\r\nI hope that it may not be so forever. If anything will stimulate to\r\nbetter methods, it is example, not precept, and perhaps the best work\r\nof this and all missions will be their reflex influences on\r\nGovernments through the governed.\r\n\r\nTo carry on the bare essentials of this work an endowment of at least\r\na million dollars is necessary. Toward this a hundred and sixty\r\nthousand dollars is all that has been contributed, and in addition we\r\ncan count annually upon a small Government grant. Even if this million\r\ndollars were given, it would still leave several thousand dollars to\r\nbe raised by voluntary subscription each year, a healthy thing for the\r\nlife of any charitable work. On the other hand, the certainty of being\r\nable to meet the main bills is an economy in nerve energy, in time and\r\nin money.\r\n\r\nAmong our patients brought in one season to St. Anthony Hospital was\r\nthe mother of ten children on whom an emergency operation for\r\nappendicitis had to be done--the first time in her life that a doctor\r\nhad ever tended her. She came from a very poor home, for besides her\r\nlarge family her husband had been all his life handicapped by a\r\nserious deformity of one leg caused by a fall. She reminded me of how\r\nsome years before a traveller had left her the rug from his dog\r\nsledge, as, without any bedclothes, she was again about to give birth\r\nto a child; how she had actually been unable at times to turn over in\r\nbed, because her personal clothing had frozen solid to the wall of the\r\none-roomed hut in which she lived.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1906, in northern Newfoundland I found a young mother near\r\nSt. Anthony. She was twenty-six years old, suffering from acute\r\nrheumatic fever, lying in a fireless loft, on a rickety bedstead with\r\nno bedclothes. She had only one shoddy black dress to her name, and no\r\nunderwear to keep her warm in bed in a house like that. The floor was\r\nlittered with débris, including a number of hard buns which she could\r\nnot now eat, but which some charitable neighbour had sent her. She had\r\na wizened baby of seven months, which every now and then she was\r\ntrying to feed by raising herself on one elbow and forcing bread and\r\nwater pap, moistened with the merest suspicion of condensed milk, down\r\nits throat. None of her four previous children had lived so long. She\r\nhad been under my care three years before for sailor's scurvy. Her\r\npresent illness lasted only a week, and in spite of all that we could\r\ndo, she died.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the people to be mutually helpful is undoubted, whether\r\nit is to each other or to some \"outsider\" like ourselves. I question\r\nif in the so-called centres of civilization the following incident can\r\nbe surpassed as evidencing this aspect of their character.\r\n\r\nIn a little Labrador village called Deep Water Creek I was called in\r\none day to see a patient: an old Englishman, who was reported to have\r\nhad \"a bad place this twelvemonth.\" As I was taken into the tiny\r\ncottage, a bright-faced, black-bearded man greeted me. Three children\r\nwere playing on the hearth with a younger man, evidently their father.\r\n\"No, Doctor, they aren't ours,\" replied my host, in answer to my\r\nquestion. \"But us took Sam as our own when he was born, and his mother\r\nlay dead. These be his little ones. You remember Kate, his wife, what\r\ndied in hospital.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the cup of hot tea so thoughtfully provided, I said, \"Skipper\r\nJohn, let's get out and see the old Englishman.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need, Doctor. He's upstairs in bed.\"\r\n\r\nUpstairs was the triangular space between the roof and the ceiling of\r\nthe ground floor. At each end was a tiny window, and the whole area,\r\nwindows included, had been divided longitudinally by a single\r\nthickness of hand-sawn lumber. Both windows were open, a cool breeze\r\nwas blowing through, and a bright paper pasted on the wall gave a\r\ncheerful impression. One corner was shut off by a screen of cheap\r\ncheesecloth. Sitting bolt upright on a low bench, and leaning against\r\nthe partition, was a very aged woman, staring fixedly ahead out of\r\nblind eyes, and ceaselessly monotoning what was meant for a hymn. No\r\nhead was visible among the rude collection of bedclothes.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Solomon, it's the Doctor,\" I called. The mass of clothes moved,\r\nand a trembling old hand came out to meet mine.\r\n\r\n\"No pain, Uncle Solomon, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"No pain, Doctor, thank the good Lord, and Skipper John. He took us in\r\nwhen the old lady and I were starving.\"\r\n\r\nThe terrible cancer had so extended its ravages that the reason for\r\nthe veiled corner was obvious, and also for the effective ventilation.\r\n\r\n\"He suffers a lot, Doctor, though he won't own it,\" now chimed in the\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\nWhen the interview was over, I was left standing in a brown study till\r\nI heard Skipper John's voice calling me. As I descended the ladder he\r\nsaid: \"We're so grateful you comed, Doctor. The poor old creatures\r\nwon't last long. But thanks aren't dollars. I haven't a cent in the\r\nworld now. The old people have taken what little we had put by. But\r\nif I gets a skin t' winter, I'll try and pay you for your visit\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Skipper John, what relation are those people to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no relation 'zactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they pay nothing at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Them has nothing,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"What made you take them in?\"\r\n\r\n\"They was homeless, and the old lady was already blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have they been with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just twelve months come Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself standing in speechless admiration in the presence of\r\nthis man. I thought then, and I still think, that I had received one\r\nof my largest fees.\r\n\r\nOurs is primarily a medical mission, and nothing that may have been\r\nstated in this book with reference to other branches of the work is\r\nmeant in any way to detract from what to us as doctors is the basic\r\nreason for our being here, though we mean ours to be prophylactic as\r\nwell as remedial medicine.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony having so indisputably become the headquarters of the\r\nhospital stations, there can be but one answer to the question of the\r\nadvisability of its closing its doors summer or winter in the days to\r\ncome. For not only is our largest hospital located there--its scope\r\ndue in great measure to the reputation gained for it by Dr. Little's\r\nsplendid services, and continued by Dr. Curtis--but also the\r\nChildren's Home, our school, machine shop, the headquarters of various\r\nindustrial enterprises, and lastly a large storehouse to be used in\r\nfuture as a distributing centre for the supplies of the general\r\nMission. Moreover, the population of the environs of St. Anthony,\r\nowing to their numbers and the fact that they can profit by the\r\nemployment given by the Mission, should be able increasingly to\r\nassist in the maintenance of this hospital, though a large number of\r\nits clinic is drawn from distant parts. These patients come not only\r\nfrom Labrador, the Straits of Belle Isle, and southern Newfoundland,\r\nbut we have had under our care Syrians, Russians, Scandinavians,\r\nFrenchmen, and naturally Americans and Canadians, seamen from\r\nschooners engaged in the Labrador fishery.\r\n\r\nHarrington Hospital, located on the Canadian Labrador, must for many\r\nyears to come depend on outside support. I am Lloyd Georgian enough to\r\nfeel that taxation should presuppose the obligation to look after the\r\nbodies of the taxed. The Quebec Government gives neither vote,\r\nrepresentation, adequate mail service, nor any public health grant for\r\nthe long section of the coast which it claims to govern, that lies\r\nwest of the Point des Eskimo. It is to my mind a severe stricture on\r\ntheir qualifications as legislators. That hospital should, we believe,\r\nbe adequately subsidized and kept open summer and winter. At present\r\nwe have to thank the Labrador Medical Mission, which is the Canadian\r\nbranch of the International Grenfell Association, for their generous\r\nand continued support of this station.\r\n\r\nBattle Harbour and Indian Harbour Hospitals can never be anything but\r\nsummer stations, owing to their geographical positions on islands in\r\nfrozen seas, on which islands there is practically no population\r\nduring the winter months. But gifts and grants sufficient to maintain\r\na doctor at Northwest River Cottage Hospital, and one if possible in\r\nLewis Bay, winter supplements to these summer hospitals, are to my\r\nthinking more than justifiable.\r\n\r\nAs to the future of our hospital stations at Pilley's Islands, Spotted\r\nIslands, and Forteau, that will depend upon the changing demands of\r\nlocal conditions. That the need of medical assistance exists is\r\nunquestionable, as is evidenced from the many appeals which I receive\r\nto start hospitals or supply doctors in districts at present utterly\r\nincapable of obtaining such help.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO ST. ANTHONY HARBOUR]\r\n\r\nOne still indispensable requisite in our scattered field of work is a\r\nhospital steamer. In fact, not a few of us think that the Strathcona\r\nis the keystone of the Mission. She reaches those who need our help\r\nmost and at times when they cannot afford to leave home and seek it.\r\nHer functions are innumerable. She is our eyepiece to keep us\r\ncognizant of our opportunities. She both treats and carries the sick\r\nand feeds the hospitals. She enables us to distribute our charity\r\nefficiently. The invaluable gifts of clothing which the Labrador\r\nNeedlework Guild and other friends send us could never be used at all\r\nas love would wish, unless the Strathcona were available to enlarge\r\nthe area reached. In spite of all this, those who would quibble over\r\ntrifles claim that she is the only craft on record that rolls at\r\ndry-dock! Her functions are certainly varied, but perhaps the oddest\r\nwhich I have ever been asked to perform was an incident which I have\r\noften told. One day, after a long stream of patients had been treated,\r\na young man with a great air of secrecy said that he wanted to see me\r\nvery privately.\r\n\r\n\"I wants to get married, Doctor,\" he confided when we were alone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's something in which I can't help you. Won't any of the\r\ngirls round here have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it isn't that. There's a girl down North I fancies, but I'm\r\nshipped to a man here for the summer, and can't get away. Wouldn't you\r\njust propose to her for me, and bring her along as you comes South?\"\r\n\r\nThe library would touch a very limited field if it were not for the\r\nhospital ship. She carries half a hundred travelling libraries each\r\nyear. She finds out the derelict children and brings them home. She is\r\noften a court of law, trying to dispense justice and help right\r\nagainst might. She has enabled us to serve not only men, but their\r\nships as well; and many a helping hand she has been able to lend to\r\nmen in distress when hearts were anxious and hopes growing faint. In a\r\nthousand little ways she is just as important a factor in preaching\r\nthe message of love. To-day she is actually loaned for her final trip,\r\nbefore going into winter quarters, to a number of heads of families,\r\nwho are thus enabled to bring out fuel for their winter fires from the\r\nlong bay just south of the hospital.\r\n\r\nHer plates are getting thin. They were never anything but\r\nthree-eighths-inch steel, and we took a thousand pounds of rust out of\r\nher after cabin alone this spring. She leaks a little--and no iron\r\nship should. It will cost two thousand dollars to put her into repair\r\nagain for future use. Money is short now, but when asked about the\r\nfuture of the Mission I feel that whatever else will be needed for\r\nmany years to come, the hospital ship at least cannot possibly be\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe child is potential energy, the father of the future man, and the\r\nfuture state; and the children of this country are integral,\r\ndetermining factors in the future of this Mission. The children who\r\nare turned out to order by institutions seem sadly deficient, both in\r\nability to cope with life and in the humanities. The \"home\" system, as\r\nat Quarrier's in Scotland, is a striking contrast, and personally I\r\nshall vote for the management of orphanages on home lines every time.\r\nThis is not a concession to Dickens, whose pictures of Bumble I hope\r\nand believe apply only to the dark ages in which Dickens lived; but\r\nhistorically they are not yet far enough removed for me to advocate\r\nGovernment orphanages, though our Government schools are an advance\r\non Dotheboys Hall.\r\n\r\nThe human body is the result of physical causes; breeding tells as\r\nsurely as it does in dogs or cows, and the probability of defects in\r\nthe offspring of poverty and of lust is necessarily greater than in\r\nwell-bred, well-fed, well-environed children. The proportion of\r\nmentally and morally deficient children that come to us absolutely\r\ndemonstrates this fact; and the love needed to see such children\r\nthrough to the end is more comprehensive than the mere sentiment of\r\nhaving a child in the home, and infinitely more than the desire to\r\nhave the help which he can bring.\r\n\r\nThe Government allows us fifty-two dollars a year toward the expense\r\nof a child whose father is dead; nothing if the mother is dead, or if\r\nthe father is alive but had better be dead. It would be wiser if each\r\ncase could be judged on its merits by competent officials. But we\r\nbelieve it is a blessing to a community to have the opportunity of\r\nfinding the balance.\r\n\r\nTested by its output and the returns to the country, our orphanage has\r\namply justified itself. One new life resultant from the outlay of a\r\nfew dollars would class the investment as gilt-edged if graded merely\r\nin cash. The community which sows a neglected childhood reaps a\r\nwhirlwind in defective manhood.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts--to leave out of consideration my earnest\r\npersonal desire--there can never be any question in my mind as to the\r\nimperative necessity of the Mission's continuance of the work for\r\nderelict children. This conclusion seems to me safeguarded by the fact\r\nthat all nations are placing increasing emphasis on \"the child in the\r\nmidst of them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Solomon chose wisdom as the gift which he most desired, the Bible\r\ntells us that it was pleasing to God. St. Paul holds out the hope\r\nthat one day we shall know as we are known. But there is a vast\r\ndifference between knowledge and being wise. In fact, from the New\r\nTestament itself we are led to believe that the devils knew far more\r\nthan even the Disciples.\r\n\r\nThe school is an essential part of the orphanage. Seeing that the\r\nvillage children needed education just as much as those for whom we\r\nwere more directly responsible, and realizing the value to both of the\r\ncoöperation, and that the denominational system which still persists\r\nin the country is a factor for division and not for unity, it became\r\nobviously desirable for us to provide such a bond. Friends made the\r\nbuilding possible. The generosity of a lady in Chicago in practically\r\nendowing it has, we feel, secured its future. We have now a proper\r\nbuilding, three teachers, a graded school, modern appliances for\r\nteaching, and vastly superior results. In these days when the\r\nexpenditure of every penny seems a widow's mite, one welcomes the\r\nencouragement of facts such as these to enable one to \"carry on.\"\r\n\r\nModern pedagogy has brought to the attention of even the man in the\r\nstreet the realization that education consists not merely in its\r\naccepted scholastic aspect, but also that training of the eye and hand\r\nwhich in turn fosters the larger development of the mind. In the\r\nlatter sense our people are far from uneducated. Taking this aptitude\r\nof theirs as a starting-point, some twelve years ago we began our\r\nindustrial department, first by giving out skin work in the North, and\r\nlater started other branches under Miss Jessie Luther, who\r\nsubsequently gave many years of service to the coast.\r\n\r\nThe coöperative movement is the same question seen from another angle,\r\nand is almost contemporaneous with our earliest hospitals.\r\n\r\nIt is not unnatural that man, realizing that he is himself like \"the\r\ngrass that to-morrow is cast into the oven,\" should worry over the\r\npermanency of the things on which he has spent himself. Though Christ\r\nespecially warns us against this anxiety, religious people have been\r\nthe greatest sinners in laying more emphasis upon to-morrow than\r\nto-day. The element which makes most for longevity is always\r\ninteresting, even if longevity is often a mistake. Almost every old\r\nparish church in England maintains some skeleton of bygone efforts\r\nwhich once met real needs and were tokens of real love.\r\n\r\nThe future is a long way off--that future when Christ's Kingdom comes\r\non earth in the consecrated hearts and wills of all mankind, when all\r\nthe superimposed efforts will be unnecessary. But love builds for a\r\nfuture, however remote; and at present we see no other way than to\r\nwork for it, and know of no better means than to insure the permanency\r\nof the hospitals, orphanage, school, and the industrial and\r\ncoöperative enterprises, thus to hasten, however little, the coming of\r\nChrist in Labrador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMY RELIGIOUS LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can write his real religious life with pen or pencil. It is\r\nwritten only in actions, and its seal is our character, not our\r\northodoxy. Whether we, our neighbour, or God is the judge, absolutely\r\nthe only value of our \"religious\" life to ourselves or to any one is\r\nwhat it fits us for and enables us to do. Creeds, when expressed only\r\nin words, clothes, or abnormal lives, are daily growing less\r\nacceptable as passports to Paradise. What my particular intellect can\r\naccept cannot commend me to God. His \"well done\" is only spoken to the\r\nman who \"wills to do His will.\"\r\n\r\nWe map the world out into black and white patches for \"heathen\" and\r\n\"Christian\"--as if those who made the charts believed that one section\r\npossessed a monopoly of God's sonship. Europe was marked white, which\r\nis to-day comment enough on this division. A black friend of mine used\r\noften to remind me that in his country the Devil was white.\r\n\r\nMy own religious experiences divide my life into three periods. As a\r\nboy at school, and as a young man at hospital, the truth or untruth of\r\nChristianity as taught by the churches did not interest me enough to\r\ndevote a thought to it. It was neither a disturbing nor a vital\r\ninfluence in my life. My mother was my ideal of goodness. I have never\r\nknown her speak an angry or unkind word. Sitting here looking back on\r\nover fifty years of life, I cannot pick out one thing to criticize in\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\nWhat did interest me was athletics. Like most English boys I almost\r\nworshipped physical accomplishments. I had the supremest contempt for\r\nclothes except those designed for action or comfort. Since no saint\r\napparently ever wore trousers, or appeared to care about football\r\nknickers, I never supposed that they could be the same flesh as myself.\r\nIt was always a barrier between me and the parsons and religious persons\r\ngenerally that they affected clothing which dubbed my ideals \"worldly.\"\r\nIt was even a barrier between myself and the Christ that I could not\r\nthink of Him in flannels or a gymnasium suit. At that time I should have\r\nconsidered such an idea blasphemous--whatever that meant. As soon as\r\nreligious services ceased to be compulsory for me, I only attended them\r\nas a concession to others. The prime object of the prayers and lessons\r\ndid not appear to be that they might be understood. So far as I could\r\nsee, common sense and plain natural feelings were at a discount. A long\r\nheritage of an eager, restless spirit left me uninterested in\r\n\"homilies,\" and aided by the \"dim religious light,\" I was enabled to\r\nsleep through both long prayers and sermons. Justice forces me to add\r\nthat the two endless hours of \"prep\" lessons after tea had very much the\r\nsame effect upon me.\r\n\r\nAt the request of my mother I once went to take a class at the Sunday\r\nSchool. These were for the \"poor only\" in England in those days.\r\nLittle effort was expended on making them attractive. I recall nothing\r\nbut disgust at the dirty urchins with whom I had to associate for half\r\nan hour. An incident which happened on the death of one of the boys at\r\nmy father's school interested me temporarily in religion. The boy's\r\nfather happened to be a dissenter, and our vicar refused to allow the\r\ngates of the parish churchyard to be opened to enable the funeral\r\ncortège to enter. My chum had only a legal right to be buried in the\r\nyard. The coffin had therefore to be lifted over the wall and as the\r\nchurch was locked, father conducted the service in the open air. His\r\nwords at the grave-side gave a touch of reality to religion, and still\r\nmore so did his walking down the aisle out of church the following\r\nSunday when the vicar referred to the destructive influence of\r\nanything that lent colour to dissent. Later when father threw up the\r\nschool for the far more onerous and less remunerative task of chaplain\r\nat the London Hospital, even I realized that religion meant something.\r\nIndeed, it was that tax on his sensitive, nervous brain that brought\r\nhis life to its early close. No man ever had a more generous and\r\nsoft-hearted father. He never refused us any reasonable request, and\r\nvery few unreasonable ones, and allowed us an amount of\r\nself-determination enjoyed by few. How deeply and how often have I\r\nregretted that I did not understand him better. His brilliant\r\nscholarship, and the friends that it brought around him, his ability\r\nliterally to speak Greek and Latin as he could German and French, his\r\nexceptionally developed mental as compared with his physical gifts,\r\nwere undoubtedly the reasons that a very ordinary English boy could\r\nnot appreciate him.\r\n\r\nAt fourteen years of age, at Marlborough School, I was asked if I\r\nwished to be confirmed. Every boy of that age was. It permitted one to\r\nremain when \"the kids went out after first service.\" It added dignity,\r\nlike a football cap or a mustache. All I remember about it was\r\nbitterly resenting having to \"swat up\" the Catechism out of school\r\nhours. I counted, however, on the examiner being easy, and he was. I\r\nam an absolute believer in boys making a definite decision to follow\r\nthe Christ; and that in the hands of a really keen Christian man the\r\nrite of confirmation is very valuable. The call which gets home to a\r\nboy's heart is the call to do things. If only a boy can be led to see\r\nthat the following of Christ demands a real knighthood, and that true\r\nchivalry is Christ's service, he will want all the rites and\r\nceremonies that either proclaim his allegiance or promise him help and\r\nstrength to live up to it.\r\n\r\nWhat I now believe that D.L. Moody did for me was just to show that\r\nunder all the shams and externals of religion was a vital call in the\r\nworld for things that I could do. This marks the beginning of the\r\nsecond period of my religious development. He helped me to see myself\r\nas God sees the \"unprofitable servant,\" and to be ashamed. He started\r\nme working for all I was worth, and made religion real fun--a new\r\nfield brimming with opportunities. With me the pendulum swung very\r\nfar. The evangelical to my mind had a monopoly of infallible truth. A\r\nRoman Catholic I regarded as a relic of mediævalism; while almost a\r\nrigour went down my spine when a man told me that he was a \"Unitarian\r\nChristian.\" Hyphenation was loyalty compared to that. I mention this\r\nonly because it shows how I can now understand intolerance and\r\ndogmatism in others. Yes, I must have been \"very impossible,\" for then\r\nI honestly thought that I knew it all.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I began to be interested in reading my Bible, and I\r\nlearned to appreciate my father's expositions of it. At prayers he\r\nalways translated into the vernacular from the original of either the\r\nOld or the New Testament. To me he seemed to know every sense of every\r\nGreek word in any setting. Ever since I have been satisfied to use an\r\nEnglish version, knowing that I cannot improve on the words chosen by\r\nthe various learned translators.\r\n\r\nBecause I owed so much to evangelical teachers, it worried me for a\r\nlong while that I could not bring myself to argue with my boys about\r\ntheir intellectual attitude to Christ. My Sunday class contained\r\nseveral Jews whom I loved. I respected them more because they made no\r\nverbal professions. I have seen Turkish religionists dancing and\r\nwhirling in Asia Minor at their prayers. I have seen much emotional\r\nChristianity, and I fully realize the value of approaching men on\r\ntheir emotional side. A demonstrative preacher impresses large crowds\r\nof people at once. But all the same, I have learned from many\r\ndisillusionments to be afraid of overdoing emotionalism in religion.\r\nSumming up the evidence of men's Christlikeness by their characters,\r\nas I look back down my long list of loved and honoured helpers and\r\nfriends, I am certainly safe in saying that I at least should judge\r\nthat no section of Christ's Church has any monopoly of Christ's\r\nspirit; and that I should like infinitely less to be examined on my\r\nown dogmatic theology than I should thirty-five years ago. Combined\r\nwith this goes the fact that though I know the days of my stay on\r\nearth are greatly reduced, I seem to be less rather than more anxious\r\nabout \"the morrow.\" For though time has rounded off the corners of my\r\nconceit, experience of God's dealing with such an unworthy midget as\r\nmyself has so strengthened the foundations on which faith stood, that\r\nChrist now means more to me as a living Presence than when I laid more\r\nemphasis on the dogmas concerning Him.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete without an endeavour to face the\r\ntask of trying to answer the questions so often asked: \"What is your\r\nposition now? Do you still believe as you did when you first decided\r\nto serve Christ?\" I am still a communicant member \"in good standing\"\r\nof the Episcopal Church. One hopes that one's religious ideas grow\r\nlike the rest of one's life. It is fools who are said to rush in where\r\nangels fear to tread. The most powerful Christian churches in the\r\nworld, the Greek and the Roman, recognizing the great dangers\r\nthreatening, have countered by stereotyping the answer for all time,\r\nassuming all responsibility, and permitting no individual freedom in\r\nthe matter. The numbers of their adherents testify to how vast a\r\nproportion of mankind the course appeals. And yet we are sons of\r\nGod--and at our best value freedom in every department of our\r\nbeing--spirit as well as mind and body. George Adam Smith says: \"The\r\ngreat causes of God and humanity are not defeated by the hot assaults\r\nof the Devil, but by the slow, crushing, glacier-like mass of\r\nthousands and thousands of indifferent nobodies. God's causes are\r\nnever destroyed by being blown up, but by being sat upon. It is not\r\nthe violent and anarchical whom we have to fear in the war for human\r\nprogress, but the slow, the staid, the respectable; and the danger of\r\nthese lies in their real skepticism. Though it would abhor\r\narticulately confessing that God does nothing, it virtually means so\r\nby refusing to share manifest opportunities for serving Him.\"\r\n\r\nFeeble and devious as my own footsteps have been since my decision to\r\nfollow Jesus Christ, I believe more than ever that this is the only\r\nreal adventure of life. No step in life do I even compare with that\r\none in permanent satisfaction. I deeply regret that I did not take it\r\nsooner. I do not feel that it mattered much whether I chose medicine\r\nfor an occupation, or law, or education, or commerce, or any other way\r\nto justify my existence by working for a living as every honest man\r\nshould. But if there is one thing about which I never have any\r\nquestion, it is that the decision and endeavour to follow the Christ\r\ndoes for men what nothing else on earth can. Without stultifying our\r\nreason, it develops all that makes men godlike. Christ claimed that it\r\nwas the only way to find out truth.\r\n\r\nTo me, enforced asceticism, vows of celibacy, denunciation of\r\npleasures innocent in themselves, intellectual monopoly of\r\ninterpretation of things past or present, written or unwritten, are\r\ntravesties of common sense, which is to me the Voice within. Not being\r\na philosopher, I do not classify it, but I listen to it, because I\r\nbelieve it to be the Voice of God. That is the first point which I\r\nhave no fear in putting on record.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary revelations of some Power outside ourselves leading\r\nand guiding and helping and chastening are, I am certain, really the\r\nordinary experiences of every man who is willing to accept the fact\r\nthat we are sons of God. Only a child, however, who submits to his\r\nfather can expect to enjoy or understand his dealings. If we look into\r\nour everyday life we cannot fail to see that God not only allows but\r\nseeks our coöperation in the establishment of His Kingdom. So the\r\nsecond fundamental by which I stand is the certainty of a possible\r\nreal and close relationship between man and God. Not one qualm assails\r\nmy intellect or my intuition when I say that I know absolutely that\r\nGod is my Father. To live \"as seeing Him who is invisible\" is my one\r\nideal which embraces all the lesser ideals of my life.\r\n\r\nIt has been my lot in life to have to stand by many death-beds, and to\r\nbe called in to dying men and women almost as a routine in my\r\nprofession. Yet I am increasingly convinced that their spirits never\r\ndie at all. I am sure that there is no real death. Death is no\r\nargument against, but rather for, life. Eternal life is the complement\r\nof all my unsatisfied ideals; and experience teaches me that the\r\nbelief in it is a greater incentive to be useful and good than any\r\nother I know.\r\n\r\nI have read \"Raymond\" with great interest. I am neither capable nor\r\nwilling to criticize those who, with the deductive ability of such\r\nmen as Sir Oliver Lodge, are brave enough and unselfish enough to\r\ndevote their talents to pioneering in a field that certainly needs and\r\nmerits more scientific investigation, seeing that it has possibilities\r\nof such great moment to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe experiences on which rest one's own convictions of continuing life\r\nare of an entirely different nature. Even though the first and\r\npersonal reason may seem foolish, it is because I desire it so much.\r\nThis is a natural passion, common to all human beings. Experience\r\nconvinces me that such longings are purposeful and do not go\r\nunsatisfied.\r\n\r\nNo, we do not know everything yet; and perhaps the critic is a\r\nshallower fool than he judges to be the patient delvers into the\r\nunknown beyond. The evidence on which our deductions have been based\r\nthrough the ages may suddenly be proven fallible after all. It may be\r\nthat there is no such thing as matter. Chemists and physicists now\r\nadmit that is possible. The spiritual may be far more real than the\r\nmaterial, in spite of the cocksure conceit of the current science of\r\n1918. Immortality may be the complement of mortality, as water becomes\r\nsteam, and steam becomes power, and power becomes heat, and heat\r\nbecomes light. The conclusion that life beyond is the conservation of\r\nenergy of life here may be as scientific as that great natural law for\r\nmaterial things. I see knowledge become service, service become joy. I\r\nsee fear prohibit glands from secreting, hope bring back colour to the\r\nface and tone to the blood. I see something not material make Jekyl\r\ninto Hyde; and thank God, make Hyde over into Jekyl again, when birch\r\nrods and iron bars have no effect whatever. I have seen love do\r\nphysical things which the mere intellectual convictions cannot--make\r\nhearts beat and eyes sparkle, that would not respond even to\r\ndigitalis and strychnine. I claim that the boy is justified in saying\r\nthat his kite exists in the heaven, even though it is out of sight and\r\nthe string leads round the corner, on no other presumption than that\r\nhe feels it tugging. I prefer to stand with Moses in his belief in the\r\nPromised Land, and that we can reach it, than to believe that the\r\nCelestial City is a mirage.\r\n\r\nThis attempted analysis of my religious life has revealed to me two\r\ngreat changes in my position toward its intellectual or dogmatic\r\ndemands, and both of them are reflections of the ever rightly changing\r\nattitude of the defenders of our Christian faith. \"Tempora mutantur et\r\nnos mutamus in illis.\" Christians should not fret because they cannot\r\nescape adapting themselves to the environment of 1918--which is no\r\nlonger that of 918, or 18. The one and only hope for any force,\r\nChristianity no less than others, is its ability to adapt itself to\r\nall time.\r\n\r\nI still study my Bible in the morning and scribble on the margin the\r\nlessons which I get out of the portion. I can only do it by using a\r\nnew copy each time I finish, because it brings new thoughts according\r\nto the peculiar experiences, tasks, needs, and environments of the\r\nday. I change I know. It does not--and yet it does--for we see the old\r\ntruths in new lights. That to me is the glory of the Scriptures.\r\nSomehow it suits itself always to my developing needs. Christ did not\r\nteach as did other teachers. He taught for all time. We find out that\r\nour attitude to everything changes, to the things that give us\r\npleasure and to those that give us pain. It is but a sign of healthy\r\nevolution (in this chapter, I suppose I should call it \"grace\") that\r\nthe great churches have ceased to condemn their leaders who are\r\nunsound on points which once spelt fagot and stake. To-day\r\npredestination no longer involves the same reaction, even if dropped\r\ninto a conference of selected \"Wee Frees.\" The American section of the\r\nEpiscopal Church has omitted to insist on our publicly and\r\nperiodically declaring that we must have a correct view of three\r\nIncomprehensibles, or be damned, as is still the case in our Church of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nI am writing of my religion. The churches are now teaching that\r\nreligion is action, not diction. There was a time when I could work\r\nwith only one section of the Church of God. Thank God, it was a very\r\nbrief period, but I weep for it just the same. Now I can not only work\r\nwith any section, but worship with them also. If there is error in\r\ntheir intellectual attitudes, it is to God they stand, not to me.\r\nDoubtless there is just as much error in mine. To me, he is the best\r\nChristian who \"judges not.\" To claim a monopoly of Christian religion\r\nfor any church, looked at from the point of view of following Jesus\r\nChrist, is ridiculous. So I find that I have changed, changed in the\r\nimportance which I place on what others think and upon what I myself\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nUnless a Christian is a witness in his life, his opinions do not\r\nmatter two pins to God or man. Of course, to-day _we_ should not burn\r\nSavonarola, any more than we should actually crucify that brave old\r\nfisherman, Peter, or ridicule a Gordon or a Livingstone, or\r\nassassinate a Lincoln or a Phillips Brooks, even with our tongues,\r\nthough they differed from us in their view of what the Christian\r\nreligion really needs. Oh, of course we shouldn't!\r\n\r\nPerhaps my change spells more and not less faith in the Saviour of the\r\nworld. As I love the facts of life more, I care less for fusty\r\ncommentators. As I see more of Christ's living with us all the days, I\r\ncare less for arguments about His death. I have no more doubt that He\r\nlives in His world to-day than that I do. Why should I blame myself\r\nbecause more and more my mind emphasizes the fact that it is because\r\nHe lives, and only so far as He lives in me, that I shall live also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture, in Labrador, unsuccessful, 217, 290.\r\n\r\nAlaska, reindeer experiment in, 291, 294-295.\r\n\r\nAlbert, the, hospital ship of Dr. Grenfell, 125, 188, 189.\r\n\r\n_Among the Deep-Sea Fishers_, magazine, 280.\r\n\r\nAndrews, Dr. Joseph, eye-specialist, 357.\r\n\r\nArchibald, Sir William, chairman of the Royal National Mission to\r\n  Deep-Sea Fishermen, 362.\r\n\r\nArmstrong, Dr. Seymour, his work at St. Anthony, 367.\r\n\r\nArnold, Thomas, of Rugby, 14.\r\n\r\nAthletics, Grenfell's fondness of, 21, 32, 44, 50, 51, 53, 81, 424.\r\n\r\n\r\nBailey, Florence, nurse, 326.\r\n\r\nBarnett, Samuel, of Mile End, head of Toynbee House, 83.\r\n\r\nBarter system, the evils of, 131, 132, 133-138, 215-217.\r\n\r\nBartlett, Captain, father of \"Captain Bob,\" 136.\r\n\r\nBattle Harbour, Newfoundland, site of hospital, 126, 162, 165, 169, 193.\r\n\r\nBeattie, Arthur, 192.\r\n\r\nBeetz, Mr., 239.\r\n\r\nBegbie, Harold, _Twice-Born Men_, 101.\r\n\r\nBell, Dr. Alexander Graham, 338.\r\n\r\nBelle Isle, the Straits of, Labrador, 126, 127, 140, 250.\r\n\r\nBesant, Mrs. Annie, associated with Charles Bradlaugh, 81, 82.\r\n\r\nBlandford, Captain Samuel, 159, 172.\r\n\r\nBobardt, Dr. Arthur, 126, 159-162.\r\n\r\nBooth, Walter, of New York, 370, 371.\r\n\r\nBowditch, William, 275.\r\n\r\nBoys' Brigade, the, 101, 353.\r\n\r\nBradlaugh, Charles, religious radical, 81-82.\r\n\r\n\r\nCabot, John, 120.\r\n\r\nCarpenter, Rev.
