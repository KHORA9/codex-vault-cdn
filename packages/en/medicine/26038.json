Consisting of 30 treatises, it is the only known work of\r\nal-Zahrāwī and it brought him high prestige in the western world._\r\n\r\n_Here we are concerned only with his last treatise, on surgery. With its\r\nmany drawings of surgical instruments, intended for the instruction of\r\napprentices, its descriptions of formulas and medicinal preparations,\r\nand its lucid observations on surgical procedures, this treatise is\r\nperhaps the oldest of its kind._\r\n\r\n_Scholars today have available a translation of the text and\r\nreproductions of the drawings, but many of the latter are greatly\r\nmodified from the originals._\r\n\r\n_This study reproduces examples of al-Zahrāwī’s original illustrations,\r\ncompares some with early drawings based on them, and comments on\r\npassages in the treatise of interest to students of pharmacy and medical\r\ntherapy._\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR: _Sami Hamarneh undertook this research into the history of\r\nmedicine in connection with his duties as associate curator of medical\r\nsciences in the United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF THE WRITINGS of Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn ʻAbbās\r\nal-Zahrāwī--better known as Abulcasis (d. ca. 1013)--to Western Europe\r\nwas through the Latin translation of his surgical treatise (maqālah) by\r\nGerard of Cremona (d. 1187).[1] The response to this treatise,\r\nthereafter, was much greater than the attention paid to the surgery of\r\nany of the three renowned physicians of the Eastern Caliphate: al-Rāzī\r\n(Latin, Rhazes, d. ca. 925), the greatest clinician in Arabic medicine;\r\nal-Majūsī (Haly Abbās, d. 994), the author of the encyclopedic medical\r\nwork, _al_-_Malakī_;[2] and Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, 980-1037), the author\r\nof the famous _al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb_, a codification of the whole of\r\nmedical knowledge. Because of the widespread dissemination of this Latin\r\nversion in medieval Europe beginning with the latter part of the 12th\r\ncentury, al-Zahrāwī attained more prestige in the West than he did in\r\nArabic Spain, his native country, or in any other part of the Islamic\r\nworld.[3]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 2.--The myrtle-leaf shape recommended\r\n  for paper on which medicine is to be placed for cauterizing\r\n  eyelid. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS.\r\n  91), courtesy Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Bottom_,\r\n  from Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\nThe fame attached to this surgical treatise, the 30th and last in\r\nal-Zahrāwī’s encyclopedic work _al-Taṣrīf Liman ‘Ajiza ‘an\r\nal-Ta’līf_, is founded on certain merits. The text is characterized\r\nby lucidity, careful description, and a touch of original\r\nobservation of the surgical operations to which the treatise as a\r\nwhole is devoted.[4] Al-Zahrāwī furnishes his own drawings of the\r\nsurgical and dental instruments he used, devised, or recommended for\r\na more efficient performance. The illustrations were intended to\r\nprovide instructional material for apprentices--whom al-Zahrāwī\r\ncalls his children--as well as for the benefit of those who would\r\nread the work later on.[5] The treatise is probably the oldest one\r\nknown today that contains such instructive surgical illustrations\r\nand text.[6]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 3.--Small funnel for pouring heated\r\n  lead into fistula of the eye for cauterization. _Top_, from\r\n  original Arabic manuscript (Vel. 2491), courtesy Süleymaniye\r\n  Umumi Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Sudhoff,\r\n  _Chirurgie_, courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 4.--Circular cauterization in stomach\r\n  ailments. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Tüb.

However, the pharmaceutic and therapeutic\r\ndetails of the treatise have been somewhat overlooked.\r\n\r\nAs to the various illustrations of the surgical instruments (over 200\r\nfigures in all), an almost complete representation of samples has been\r\nintroduced by Channing,[7] Leclerc,[8] Gurlt,[9] Sudhoff,[10] and\r\nothers. Nevertheless, a good number of the reproduced drawings are\r\ngreatly modified, most likely having been influenced by earlier\r\nillustrations in several Latin and vernacular versions of the\r\ntreatise.[11] This becomes clearer on comparison with seven Arabic\r\nmanuscripts that have not been fully examined by Western scholars before\r\nand that--in several instances--show more authentic drawings of\r\nal-Zahrāwī’s surgical instruments than any heretofore published.[12]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 5.--Ink markings for identifying place\r\n  of cauterization. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript\r\n  (Vel. 2491), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi Kütüphanesi\r\n  Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Argellata 1531, courtesy National\r\n  Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 6.--Cautery in hernia. _Top_, from\r\n  original Arabic manuscript (Vel. 2491), courtesy Süleymaniye\r\n  Umumi Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Leclerc,\r\n  _Albulcasis_.]\r\n\r\nThis article therefore, is an attempt to present a sample of these\r\nillustrations with brief comments regarding certain figures and passages\r\nof interest to pharmacy and medical therapy.\r\n\r\nWith much gratitude I express my indebtedness to Prof. G. Folch Jou of\r\nMadrid, to Dr. A. Süheyl Ünver and Mr. H. Dener of Istanbul, and to the\r\nlibrarians of the depository institutions for their cooperation in the\r\nreproduction of the manuscripts on microfilm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 7.--Fine tweezer for removing foreign\r\n  bodies from the ear. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript\r\n  (Ali 2854), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi Kütüphanesi\r\n  Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Leclerc, _Abulcasis_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 8.--Syringe with metal plunger-pump.\r\n  _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Ali 2854), courtesy\r\n  Süleymaniye Umumi Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from\r\n  Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\nAl-Zahrāwī frequently introduces his treatises with brief instructive\r\nand sometimes informative preludes. However, in launching the last\r\ntreatise of _al-Taṣrīf_ he expounded in a most interesting and\r\nilluminating manner the status of surgery during his time. He also\r\nexplains the reasons that forced him to write on this topic and why he\r\nwished to include, as he did, precautions, advice, instructional notes,\r\nand beautifully illustrated surgical drawings. For example, the prelude\r\nto the treatise mentions four incidents that he witnessed, all ending\r\nwith tragic results because of the ignorance of physicians who attempted\r\nto operate on patients without the proper training in anatomy and\r\nsurgical manipulation. \"For if one does not have the knowledge of\r\nanatomy,\" al-Zahrāwī protests, then \"... he is apt to fall in errors\r\nthat lead to death as I have seen it happen to many.\"[13]\r\n\r\nAl-Zahrāwī divides his surgical treatise into three sections (abwāb). In\r\nthe first section (56 chapters)[14] he elaborates upon the uses and\r\ndisadvantages of cautery in general. And on the ground that \"fire\r\ntouches only the ailing part ... without causing much damage to\r\nsurrounding area,\" as caustic medicine does, he prefers cautery by fire\r\n(al-kay bi al-nār) to cautery by medicine (bi al-dawā).[15] This, he\r\nadds, \"became clear to us through lifelong experience, diligent\r\npractice, and thorough investigations of facts.\"[16]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 9.--Metal nose dropper. _Top_, from\r\n  original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy\r\n  Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Middle_, from Channing,\r\n  _Albucasis_ (_Smithsonian photo 46891-C_). _Bottom_, from\r\n  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_, courtesy National Library of\r\n  Medicine.]\r\n\r\nHe also proposes that instruments made of iron are more practical in\r\nmany ways than those made of gold, because often, when gold instruments\r\nare put in fire, they either are not heated enough or are overheated,\r\ncausing the gold to melt.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 10.--Dental scrapers. _Top_, from\r\n  original Arabic manuscript (Vel. 2491), courtesy Süleymaniye\r\n  Umumi Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Left_, from Argellata 1531,\r\n  courtesy National Library of Medicine. _Right_, from\r\n  Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\nAl-Zahrāwī gently refutes the superstition that cautery is \"good only in\r\nspringtime,\" and states that \"under the right conditions of the body’s\r\nhumors it could be used in all seasons.\"[17] Although he recommends\r\ncautery rather highly, he never minimizes the importance of treatment\r\nby drugs. Actually, he encourages the use of drugs, before, with, and\r\nafter cauterization.[18] For example, in chapter 16 on \"the\r\ncauterization of eyelid when its hair grows reversedly into the eye,\" he\r\nrecommends treatment by cautery and by medicine. In cautery, the area\r\nwhere fire is to be placed is marked with ink in the shape of a myrtle\r\nleaf. In drug treatment, the caustic medicine is applied to the eyelid\r\nover a paper in the shape of a myrtle leaf (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 11.--Dental forceps. _Top_, from\r\n  original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy\r\n  Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Bottom_, from Leclerc,\r\n  _Abulcasis_.]\r\n\r\nIn chapter 17 the author refers to an ancient method regarding cautery\r\nof the fistula in the inner corner of the eye. After incising the\r\nfistula, one \"dirham\" (derived from the Greek \"drachma,\" which is equal\r\nto about 2.97 grams)[19] of melted lead is poured into it through a fine\r\nfunnel used for cauterization (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 12.--Golden bridge to stabilize shaky\r\n  teeth. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91),\r\n  courtesy Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Left_, from\r\n  Argellata 1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.\r\n  _Right_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, al-Zahrāwī discusses cautery of the stomach and the\r\n\"cold liver\" in chapters 26 and 27, respectively. The drawings therein\r\nrepresent shapes of the burns on the skin (fig. 4) and marks of ink to\r\nbe drawn beneath the cartilage of the ribs (fig. 5) for the purpose of\r\nspotting the area of operation. Here also he describes carefully and\r\nclearly the methods of applying cautery and the types, position, and\r\nnumber of tools employed in each case. He likewise depicts (in chapter\r\n45) instruments used in the treatment of hernia (fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe second section (bāb), with about 99 chapters,[20] deals with\r\nincision, puncturing, venesection, cupping, surgery on abscesses, and\r\nthe withdrawal of arrows from the body. Al-Zahrāwī warns that ignorance\r\nin such operations may lead to damage of an artery or vein, causing loss\r\nof blood \"by which life is sustained.\"[21] Moreover, needle and thread\r\n(more than one kind is mentioned) for the stitching of wounds are\r\nrepeatedly recommended.\r\n\r\nAccording to al-Zahrāwī, foreign bodies that lodge in the ear (chapter\r\n6) are of four origins: (1) \"mineral stones\" or substances resembling\r\nmineral stones such as iron and glass; (2) plant seeds (chick-peas and\r\nbeans); (3) liquids, such as water and vinegar; and (4) animals, such\r\nas fleas. Several instruments are recommended for the removal of such\r\nforeign bodies--fine tweezers shaped like a dropper (fig. 7), a syringe\r\nwith plunger-pump, and a tube made of silver or copper (fig. 8). Also of\r\ninterest to pharmacy and therapy is the advice in regard to the use of\r\nlubricants to be applied before administering these fine instruments\r\ninto the body’s cavities.\r\n\r\nChapter 24 is concerned with the treatment of the polypus that grows in\r\nthe nose. The various kinds (including cancer growth), shapes, and\r\ncolors of this type tumor and its treatment by surgery or medicine are\r\ndescribed. A hollowed nose-dropper made of metal in the shape of a small\r\nkerosene lamp[22] is suggested (fig. 9). The dropper is held by its\r\nhandle while its contents are heated before use. Applying heat to nose\r\ndrops was probably proposed because it serves two purposes: it allows\r\neasier flow of the \"duhn,\" or the fatty substance used, and it raises\r\nthe temperature of the drops to that of the body.\r\n\r\nIn his discussion on dental hygiene,[23] al-Zahrāwī describes scrapers\r\nand dental forceps for teeth cleaning and extraction (figs. 10, 11) and\r\nbrings in a few points of historical interest.[24] He warns of the\r\ncommon error of extracting the adjacent healthy tooth instead of the\r\nailing one due to the patient’s sense deception. For a gargle he\r\nprescribes salt water, vinegar, and wine (sharāb). To stop hemorrhage he\r\nused blue vitriol (al-zāj)--copper sulfate in our modern terminology.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 33 al-Zahrāwī discusses bridge-making for the consolidation\r\nof shaky teeth (fig. 12). He prefers the use of stable gold over silver\r\nwhich, he says, putrifies and rots in a short time. In a rational\r\napproach, he also suggests that the fallen tooth itself, or a similar\r\none shaped out of a cow’s bone, be installed and connected with\r\nadjacent, stable teeth by a bridge.\r\n\r\nNow, turning to chapter 36, we find al-Zahrāwī describing a knife-thin\r\ntongue depressor (fig. 13) that he used to facilitate the examination of\r\ninflamed tonsils and other swellings of the throat; it was made of\r\nsilver or copper. And in chapter 37 (chapter 34 in Bes. 503), he\r\ndescribes the excision of an inflamed uvula by surgery. In the same\r\nchapter, he also mentions the use of instruments made of steel. Of\r\npharmaceutical interest is the following free translation of the formula\r\nhe prescribes \"as a milder treatment by fumigation ... to be resorted to\r\nonly when the swelling is subsiding\":[25]\r\n\r\n  Take pennyroyal [_Mentha pulegium_ Linn.], absinthe\r\n  [_Artemisia maritima_ Linn.], thyme, rue, hyssop, camomile,\r\n  abrotanum [_Artemisia abrotanum_ Linn.], and other similar\r\n  herbs. Put all in a casserole and cover them with vinegar.\r\n  Then close tightly with clay [_lutum-sapientiae_]--except\r\n  for a small hole in the middle of the cover--and boil.\r\n  Connect one end of a hollowed instrument, a crude form of an\r\n  inhaler [fig. 14], with the hole in the cover and insert the\r\n  other end, which contains the nozzle, into the patient’s\r\n  mouth, allowing the vapor to rise up to the uvula. And if\r\n  you are not able to secure this instrument, take a straw and\r\n  attach its end to an egg-shell. The egg-shell will prevent\r\n  burns in the patient’s mouth that might be caused by the\r\n  heated vapor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 13.--Metal tongue depressor. _Top_,\r\n  from original Arabic manuscript (Ali 2854), courtesy\r\n  Süleymaniye Umumi Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü._ Bottom_, from\r\n  Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 14.--Crude form of an inhaler. _Top_,\r\n  from original Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy\r\n  Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Bottom_, from Argellata\r\n  1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\nAl-Zahrāwī repeats in chapter 53, on cancer, what Greek physicians had\r\nsaid earlier, that cancer could be removed by surgery only at its first\r\nstage and when found in a removable part of the body, such as the\r\nbreast. Therefore, he confesses that neither he nor any one else he\r\nknew of ever applied surgery with success on advanced cancer.[26]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 15.--Metallic syringe for injecting\r\n  solutions into the bladder. _Top_, from original Arabic\r\n  manuscript (Bes. 503), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi\r\n  Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Argellata 1531,\r\n  courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 16.--Metallic or porcelain syringes\r\n  for injection of enemas. _Top_, from original Arabic\r\n  manuscript (Ali 2854), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi\r\n  Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Argellata 1531,\r\n  courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\nOf special interest in chapter 59 is the metallic \"syringe\" (fig. 15)\r\nused to inject medicinal solutions into the bladder: \"The hollow passage\r\n[of the syringe] should be exactly equal to the plunger it contains and\r\nno more, so that when such fluids from an excess of humors are aspirated\r\nthey will be drawn out, and likewise when the solutions are injected\r\nthey will be pushed in easily.\" Such description of the use of a\r\n\"bladder syringe\" in the late 10th century clearly points to the\r\npractical and interesting approach to surgery in _al-Taṣrīf_. Moreover,\r\nhis description of the removal of a stone from the bladder--an operation\r\nwe now call lithotomy--is considered a contribution to bladder surgery.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest recorded operations for the extractions of two dead\r\nfetuses from the womb is clearly described in chapter 76. The account of\r\nthis case shows not only al-Zahrāwī’s intelligent approach as a shrewd\r\nobserver but also his clinical and surgical ability.\r\n\r\nDrawings of bulb-syringe instruments used for administering enemas in\r\nailments of the rectum and for the treatment of diarrhea and colic are\r\ndepicted in chapter 83. The text describes several kinds of syringes\r\nmade of silver, porcelain, and copper in various sizes (fig. 16). Of\r\nparticular interest is an illustration of a syringe, especially\r\nrecommended for children, to which a piece of leather (jildah) is\r\nattached (fig. 17). This instrument is a precursor of our modern bulb\r\nsyringe.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 84 al-Zahrāwī turns to the treatment of various wounds. He\r\nprescribes the following powder formula for use: \"Take olibanum\r\n[frankincense] and dragon’s blood,[27] two parts of each, and three\r\nparts of slaked or unslaked lime. Pound them well, pass through a sieve\r\nand apply the powder to the wound.\" In cases of damaged blood vessels,\r\nhe tied the arteries by ligature, a practice of which he was a pioneer.\r\nIn another chapter he describes four methods for suturing the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\nAl-Zahrāwī, being associated with war casualties and writing his\r\ntreatise about the end of the 10th century, no doubt had the experience\r\nof dealing with cases involving injuries caused by arrows. The text in\r\nchapter 94 discloses his observations in elaborate investigations\r\nregarding the extraction of various kinds of arrows from the body.[28]\r\nAccordingly, several kinds of hooks and forceps for removing arrows are\r\ndescribed and depicted in the treatise (see fig. 18). Al-Zahrāwī’s\r\nmention of Turkish bows and arrows led Freind to believe, erroneously,\r\nthat the author of the treatise must have lived in the 12th century,[29]\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that Turkish bows and arrows were in common use\r\nin the latter part of the 10th century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 17.--A crude form of bulb syringe\r\n  recommended for use with children. _Top_, from original\r\n  Arabic manuscript (Ali 2854), courtesy Süleymaniye Umumi\r\n  Kütüphanesi Müdürlüğü. _Bottom_, from Leclerc, _Abulcasis_.]\r\n\r\nThe next chapter, on cupping, mentions the use of cups made of horns,\r\nwood, copper, or glass, according to circumstances and the availability\r\nof material. The methods of treatment are divided into two kinds: dry\r\ncupping, with or without fire, and wet cupping (see fig. 19). He\r\nprescribes ointments and aromatic and medicated waters to be applied\r\nbefore and after cupping to facilitate healing. Only when cupping is not\r\npossible, as on the nose, fingers, and similar parts of the human body,\r\ndoes he propose the use of leeches for treatment.[30] Evidently this is\r\nan indication that he did not, as generally supposed, encourage the\r\nwidespread use of leeches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 18.--Hooks and forceps used for the\r\n  extraction of arrows. _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript\r\n  (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen.\r\n  _Bottom_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 19.--Cupping. _Top_, from original\r\n  Arabic manuscript (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy\r\n  Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. _Bottom_, from Argellata\r\n  1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\nThe third and final section, of 35 chapters, deals with the reduction,\r\nluxation, and treatment of injured bones, including fracture of the\r\npelvis. The advices and warnings in the prelude of this section appear\r\nto repeat some of al-Zahrāwī’s sayings that had been covered in his\r\nprevious introductions. The text, however, presents many facets of\r\ninterest to the health professions. It elaborates upon the application\r\nof various forms of bandages and plasters in a variety of operations.\r\nAl-Zahrāwī’s detailed description relating to fractures of bones is a\r\nfine anatomical document of historical interest. He illustrates and\r\ndescribes special methods for tying injured or broken bones, and he\r\nsuggests that bandages made of soft linen be less and less tight as\r\ndistance increases from the injured place (chapter 1). For the\r\nprotection of areas adjacent to the injured part against contact with\r\nedges of splints he advocates padding with soft gauze and carded wool.\r\nIn some cases, to guard against swelling, he preferred a delay of one or\r\nmore days in applying bandages over splints. Al-Zahrāwī also devised\r\nand depicted many kinds and shapes of splints for use in simple and\r\ncompound fractures of the head, shoulders, arms, fingers, etc. (see fig.\r\n20). For example, in discussing the reduction of the humerus, he\r\nrecommends a splint consisting of a smooth, thin stick bent in the shape\r\nof a bow with two strings, each attached to one end of the stick (fig.\r\n21). The injured bone is then placed in the middle of the bent splint\r\nfor reduction while the patient is seated on a chair. Tying is applied\r\nonly when there is no \"hot\" swelling (chapter 11). One of the remarkable\r\nobservations made in this section is the description of the paralysis\r\ncaused by fracture of the spine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 20.--Splint \"in the shape of a spoon\r\n  without a bowl.\" _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript\r\n  (Tüb. MS. 91), courtesy Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen.\r\n  _Bottom_, from Channing, _Albucasis_.]\r\n\r\nOf interest to historians of medical therapy and pharmacy are the\r\nrecipes for poultices that al-Zahrāwī recommends for use over\r\nfractured bones. For example, he gives the following recipe for one\r\nsuch poultice: \"Take the so-called 'mill’s dust' [ghubār al-rahā],\r\nwhich is the part of the wheat flour that clings to the walls of the\r\nmill during grinding [lubāb al-daqīq], and, without sifting away the\r\nbran, knead with white-of-egg to a medium consistency, and apply.\"\r\nAnother, more elaborate, recipe calls for 10 dirhams each of the\r\nroots of wild pomegranate [_Glossostemon bruguieri_ D.C.], chickling\r\nvetch [the grass pea, _Lathymus sativus_], and white marshmallow; 5\r\ndirhams each of myrrh and aloes; 6 dirhams of white gum Arabic\r\n[_Acacia_]; and 20 dirhams of bole [friable earthy clay consisting\r\nlargely of hydrous silicates of aluminum and magnesium, usually\r\ncolored red because of impurities of iron oxide]. Procedure was to\r\npound all ingredients gently, pass them through a sieve, and knead\r\nwith water or white-of-egg (chapter 1).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Figure 21.--A splint to support the arm.\r\n  _Top_, from original Arabic manuscript (Cod. N.F. 476A),\r\n  courtesy Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek. _Bottom_, from\r\n  Argellata 1531, courtesy National Library of Medicine.]\r\n\r\nThe question arises as to whether al-Zahrāwī did any human dissection.\r\nThe answer is uncertain because our knowledge of his life is\r\nfragmentary. However, he gives no clue to the dissection of humans in\r\nany of the 30 treatises of _al-Taṣrīf_--his only known writings--and\r\nthere is no evidence that he practiced it in secret. His upright\r\nattitude as a Muslim who repeatedly emphasized his adherence to his\r\nfaith suggests that he relied completely on animal dissection and the\r\nwritings of his Greek-Roman and Islamic predecessors. Physicians in both\r\nthe Islamic domain and in Christendom for many centuries were hostile to\r\nthe idea of human dissection for any purpose because of their\r\ntraditional socio-religious convictions, considering it an unethical and\r\nundignified practice. Perhaps it has been al-Zahrāwī’s original\r\ncontributions to surgery, his enthusiasm in emphasizing the value of\r\nanatomical knowledge, and his recognition of the necessity that only\r\nwell-educated, well-trained doctors should perform surgery that have led\r\nsome medical historians to wonder whether he did human dissection at\r\nsome time in his long years of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Summary\r\n\r\nThe few examples of illustrations of surgical instruments given here\r\nindicate that the Arabic manuscripts, in general, have preserved the\r\noriginal, oriental, artistic features of the drawings in a way that has\r\nbeen overlooked in Latin and vernacular versions of _al-Taṣrīf_.\r\n\r\nIn presenting his personal observations and original ideas on surgery\r\nlate in life, al-Zahrāwī, for the most part, was inspired by a thorough\r\nacquaintance with Greek and Arabic medical literature supplemented by\r\nlifelong intelligent observation and experience.\r\n\r\nThrough its descriptions and illustrations, the surgical treatise of\r\nal-Zahrāwī very likely played a significant role in the designing of\r\nimproved surgical instruments in the Middle Ages. Also, the treatise no\r\ndoubt promoted the development of improved surgical techniques in Islam\r\nand, through its translations, promoted these techniques to an even\r\ngreater extent in the West, a fact that justifies the fame of this\r\ntreatise as the highest expression of the development of surgery in\r\nArabic Spain--a treatise whose influence continued to the Renaissance.\r\nIt contributed in no small measure to the idea of equipping learned and\r\nwell-trained surgeons with the best surgical tools and techniques of the\r\ntime; moreover, it encouraged the invention of new instruments to meet\r\ndiffering circumstances and special conditions. These tools no doubt\r\ngreatly facilitated the work of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nThroughout the text of _al-Taṣrīf_ al-Zahrāwī gave careful attention\r\nto the importance of pharmaceutical preparations in the healing art,\r\nincluding cases requiring surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1] George Sarton, _Introduction to the History of\r\n  Science_, Baltimore, 1927, vol. 1, p. 681.\r\n\r\n  [2] Mohammad S. Abu Ganima, in _Abul-Kasim ein Forscher der\r\n  Arabischen Medizin_, Berlin, 1929, suggested that\r\n  description of operations in al-Majūsī’s surgery is clearer\r\n  than that in al-Zahrāwī’s--a statement which does not seem\r\n  acceptable.\r\n\r\n  [3] Max Neuburger, _Geschichte der Medizin_, Stuttgart,\r\n  1911, vol. 2, pt. 1, pp. 178-179.\r\n\r\n  [4] Heinrich Haeser, _Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Medizin\r\n  und der epidemischen Krankheiten_, Jena, 1875, vol. 1, pp.\r\n  578-584; and Donald Campbell, _Arabian Medicine and Its\r\n  Influence on the Middle Ages_, London, 1926, vol. 1, p. 88.\r\n\r\n  [5] See the prelude to the treatise.\r\n\r\n  [6] Fielding H. Garrison (_An Introduction of the History of\r\n  Medicine_, ed. 4, rev., Philadelphia, 1929, p. 132), states,\r\n  in reference to \"Sudhoff and others,\" that many drawings\r\n  earlier than those of al-Zahrāwī have been discovered in\r\n  medieval manuscripts. However, Garrison overlooked the fact\r\n  that al-Zahrāwī’s surgical illustrations were mainly\r\n  depicted for instructional purposes--a unique approach. It\r\n  should be noted also that al-Zahrāwī died almost a century\r\n  earlier than Garrison thought. See also Martin S. Spink,\r\n  \"Arabian Gynaecological, Obstetrical and Genito-Urinary\r\n  Practice Illustrated from Albucasis,\" _Proceedings of the\r\n  Royal Society of Medicine_, 1937, vol. 30, p. 654.\r\n\r\n  [7] Johannis Channing, _Albucasis de Chirurgia. Arabice et\r\n  Latine_, Oxford, 1778, 2 vols. (hereinafter referred to as\r\n  Channing, _Albucasis_). The text has many errors in spelling\r\n  and grammar, but Leclerc went too far in criticizing this\r\n  edition, which has many merits. Moreover, the surgical\r\n  illustrations (reproduced from the Huntington and Marsh\r\n  manuscripts of the Bodleian Library) in Channing’s edition\r\n  are of special interest.\r\n\r\n  [8] Lucien Leclerc, _La Chirurgie d’Abulcasis_, Paris, 1861\r\n  (hereinafter referred to as Leclerc, _Abulcasis_). This\r\n  excellent French version was first published in a series of\r\n  articles in _Gazette Médicale de l’Algérie_, and seems\r\n  influenced by Channing’s edition more than Leclerc admits.\r\n  Leclerc consulted several Arabic copies of the treatise as\r\n  well as Latin and vernacular translations, but only a few of\r\n  these Arabic manuscripts are considered complete. The Arabic\r\n  manuscripts studied for the present article are not the same\r\n  as those used by Leclerc.

In the text and illustrations, Gurlt relied upon\r\n  Leclerc’s translation and modified drawings of the surgical\r\n  instruments; nevertheless, he presents a brief, systematic\r\n  study--probably the best so far--of the entire treatise.\r\n\r\n  [10] Karl Sudhoff, _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Chirurgie im\r\n  Mittelalter_, Leipzig, 1918 (hereinafter referred to as\r\n  Sudhoff, _Chirurgie_), vol. 2, pp. 16-84, with a few plates.\r\n  Although Sudhoff consulted the fragmentary Arabic manuscript\r\n  indexed as \"Cod. Arab. 1989\" in Gotha, Germany, he relied\r\n  mainly upon Latin versions of the treatise and the\r\n  illustrations contained in them.\r\n\r\n  [11] See Leclerc, _Abulcasis_, in introduction.\r\n\r\n  [12] The seven Arabic manuscripts are indexed as \"Berlin MS.\r\n  Or. fol. 91,\" temporarily at Universitätsbibliothek\r\n  Tübingen, in Germany; \"Escorial MS. Arabe No. 876,\" at\r\n  Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo el Real de El\r\n  Escorial, in Spain; \"Wien MS. Cod.

Hereinafter these manuscripts are\r\n  referred to, respectively, as Tüb. MS. 91; Esc. 876; Wien\r\n  476 A; Ali 2854; Bes. 502; Bes. 503; and Vel. 2491. The\r\n  Smithsonian Institution recently obtained a microfilm copy\r\n  of Bankipore Manuscript No. 17 from the Khuda Bakhsh O. P.\r\n  Library, Patna (Bihar), India. This manuscript, containing\r\n  only the 30th treatise of _al-Taṣrīf_, was copied in 1189;\r\n  therefore, it is the earliest dated Arabic manuscript of the\r\n  surgical treatise known to exist. The surgical illustrations\r\n  therein add weight to the belief that the Arabic manuscripts\r\n  show more originality in the drawings than do the later\r\n  copied versions, which often were inaccurate and possibly\r\n  distorted. About ten other illustrations from the Arabic\r\n  manuscript in Istanbul indexed as \"Topkapi MS. No. 1990\"\r\n  (which contains 215 beautifully illustrated figures) were\r\n  presented by A. S. Ünver and Hüseyin Usman in an extract\r\n  titled \"Meşhur Arab Cerrahi Elbülkasimi Zehravi ve onum\r\n  Kitabül Cerrahiyesi,\" Istanbul, 1935.

MS. 91 and Esc.\r\n  876, where only 55 chapters are listed.\r\n\r\n  [15] Al-Zahrāwī mentions several caustic medicines used in\r\n  cautery, among which are garlic, mustard, melted lead,\r\n  slaked or unslaked lime with or without \"common\" soap,\r\n  Thapsia (_Ruta graveolens_ Linn.), and juice of the Oriental\r\n  cashew nut (_Senecarpus anacardium_ Linn.).\r\n\r\n  [16] Vel. 2491, fol. 106; Bes. 502, fol. 523r-524v.\r\n\r\n  [17] Al-Zahrāwī criticizes those who interpret the saying\r\n  \"cautery is the end of treatment\" to mean that cauterization\r\n  is the best and only conclusive treatment at the physician’s\r\n  disposal. He points out that other treatments, such as\r\n  drugs, should be resorted to first, and used until they\r\n  prove of no avail; and he states that only after cautery\r\n  proves to be the cure should it be considered the completion\r\n  of medical treatment--\"al-kay ākhir al-ṭibb.\" See Vel. 2491,\r\n  fol. 106; and Bes. 502, fol. 524r-525v.\r\n\r\n  [18] For healing, soothing, or emollient purposes,\r\n  al-Zahwārī suggested medications, such as egg white, salt\r\n  water (normal saline), sap of psyllium, several ointments,\r\n  \"duhn\" of rose, and other \"adhān\" (plural of \"duhn,\" the\r\n  fatty or oily essences extracted from various substances\r\n  through pharmaceutical processes).\r\n\r\n  [19] For a more accurate estimate of the equivalence of\r\n  \"dirham\" according to the area in which the measurement was\r\n  taken, the reader may consult Walter Hinz, _Islamische Masse\r\n  und Gewichte umgerechnet ins metrische System_, Leiden,\r\n  1955, pt. 1, pp. 2-8; and George C.
