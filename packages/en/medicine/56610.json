Hayward whose able\r\nassistance has helped to make the task lighter._\r\n\r\n_In the course of preparing this narrative many books have been\r\nconsulted. I trust their authors will agree with me that a bibliography\r\nin a personal history is cumbersome and accept a general but none the\r\nless grateful acknowledgment._\r\n\r\n_My admiration has always gone out to the person who can put himself in\r\nprint and set down for historical purposes an exact record of his honest\r\nfeelings and thoughts, even though they may seem to reflect upon many of\r\nhis friends and helpers. I have not in this story hurt any one by\r\nintent. Because its thread has, of necessity, followed dramatic\r\nhighlights, many people who played prominent parts have not been\r\nmentioned. These I have not forgotten, nor those numerous others who\r\nmade smaller offerings. Some have pioneered in their special fields and\r\nlocalities; some have given generously and unfailingly of their\r\nfinancial help; some have volunteered in full measure their time and\r\nefforts as officers and Committee members; some have fought and labored\r\nby my side throughout the years; some have stepped in for only a brief\r\nbut significant role. Although on the outskirts of the army, it is to\r\nthese last as well as to those in the vanguard that the advance has been\r\nmade. And particularly do I wish to thank those co-workers and members\r\nof the various staffs whose contributions can in no way be measured by\r\ntheir duties, and whose indefatigable, loyal devotion has been a bulwark\r\nof strength to me at all times._\r\n\r\n_It has been impossible to carry out my sincere desire to give personal\r\nand individual recognition and expression of gratitude to all. Neither a\r\nhistory of the birth control movement nor the part I have taken in it\r\ncould be complete, however, did I not pay tribute to the integrity,\r\nvaliance, courage, and clarity of vision of the men and women who, year\r\nafter year, maintained their principles, and never swerved from them in\r\na cause which belongs to all of us._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                 I.

When I was a little girl the\r\noaks and the pines met the stone walks at the top of the hill, and there\r\nin the woods my father built his house, hoping mother’s “congestion of\r\nthe lungs” would be helped if she could breathe the pure, balsam-laden\r\nair.\r\n\r\nMy mother, Anne Purcell, always had a cough, and when she braced herself\r\nagainst the wall the conversation, which was forever echoing from room\r\nto room, had to stop until she recovered. She was slender and straight\r\nas an arrow, with head well set on sloping shoulders, black, wavy hair,\r\nskin white and spotless, and with wide-apart eyes, gray-green, flecked\r\nwith amber. Her family had been Irish as far back as she could trace;\r\nthe strain of the Norman conquerors had run true throughout the\r\ngenerations, and may have accounted for her unfaltering courage.\r\n\r\nMother’s sensitivity to beauty found some of its expression in flowers.\r\nWe had no money with which to buy them, and she had no time to grow\r\nthem, but the woods and fields were our garden. I can never remember\r\nsitting at a table not brightened with blossoms; from the first spring\r\narbutus to the last goldenrod of autumn we had an abundance.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was the Victorian Age, our home was almost free from\r\nVictorianism. Father himself had made our furniture. He had even cut and\r\npolished the slab of the big “marble-topped table,” as it was always\r\ncalled. Only in the spare room stood a piece bought at a store—a\r\nvarnished washstand. The things you made yourself were not considered\r\nquite good enough for guests. Sometimes father’s visitors were doctors,\r\nteachers, or perhaps the village priest, but mostly they were the\r\nartisans of the community—cabinet makers, masons, carpenters who admired\r\nhis ideas as well as shared his passion for hunting. In between tramping\r\nthe woods and talking they had helped to frame and roof the house,\r\nworking after hours to do this.\r\n\r\nFather, Michael Hennessy Higgins, born in Ireland, was a nonconformist\r\nthrough and through. All other men had beards or mustaches—not he. His\r\nbright red mane, worn much too long according to the family, swept back\r\nfrom his massive brow; he would not clip it short as most fathers did.\r\nActually it suited his finely-modeled head. He was nearly six feet tall\r\nand hard-muscled; his keen blue eyes were set off by pinkish, freckled\r\nskin. Homily and humor rippled unceasingly from his generous mouth in a\r\nbrogue which he never lost. The jokes with which he punctuated every\r\nstory were picked up, retold, and scattered about. When I was little\r\nthey were beyond me, but I could hear my elders laughing.\r\n\r\nThe scar on father’s forehead was his badge of war service. When Lincoln\r\nhad called for volunteers against the rebellious South, he had taken his\r\nonly possessions, a gold watch inherited from his grandfather and his\r\nown father’s legacy of three hundred dollars, and had run away from his\r\nhome in Canada to enlist. But he had been told he was not old enough,\r\nand was obliged to wait impatiently a year and a half until, on his\r\nfifteenth birthday, he had joined the Twelfth New York Volunteer Cavalry\r\nas a drummer boy.\r\n\r\nOne of father’s adventures had been the capture of a Confederate captain\r\non a fine mule, the latter being counted the more valuable acquisition\r\nto the regiment. We were brought up in the tradition that he had been\r\none of three men selected by Sherman for bravery. That made us very\r\nproud of him. Better not start anything with father; he could beat\r\nanybody! But he himself had been appalled by the brutalities of war;\r\nnever thereafter was he interested in fighting, unless perhaps his Irish\r\nsportsmanship cropped out when two well-matched dogs were set against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon leaving the Army father had studied anatomy, medicine,\r\nand phrenology, but these had been merely for perfecting his skill in\r\nmodeling. He made his living by chiseling angels and saints out of huge\r\nblocks of white marble or gray granite for tombstones in cemeteries. He\r\nwas a philosopher, a rebel, and an artist, none of which was calculated\r\nto produce wealth. Our existence was like that of any artist’s\r\nfamily—chickens today and feathers tomorrow.\r\n\r\nChristmases were on the poverty line. If any of us needed a new winter\r\novercoat or pair of overshoes, these constituted our presents. I was the\r\nyoungest of six, but after me others kept coming until we were eleven.\r\nOur dolls were babies—living, wriggling bodies to bathe and dress\r\ninstead of lifeless faces that never cried or slept. A pine beside the\r\ndoor was our Christmas tree. Father liked us to use natural things and\r\nwe had to rely upon ingenuity rather than the village stores, so we\r\ndecorated it with white popcorn and red cranberries which we strung\r\nourselves. Our most valuable gift was that of imagination.\r\n\r\nWe had little time for recreation. School was five miles away and we had\r\nto walk back and forth twice a day as well as perform household duties.\r\nThe boys milked the cow, tended the chickens, and took care of Tom, the\r\nold white horse which pulled our sleigh up and down the hill. The girls\r\nhelped put the younger children to bed, mended clothes, set the table,\r\ncleaned the vegetables, and washed the dishes. We accepted all this with\r\nno sense of deprivation or aggrievement, being, if anything, proud of\r\nsharing responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd we made the most of our vacations. There were so many of us that we\r\ndid not have to depend upon outsiders, and Saturday afternoons used to\r\nput on plays by ourselves in the barn. Ordinarily we were shy about\r\ndisplaying emotions; we looked upon tears and temper in other homes with\r\nshocked amazement as signs of ill-breeding. Play-acting, however, was\r\nsomething else again. Here we could find outlet for histrionic talent\r\nand win admiration instead of lifted eyebrows. I rather fancied myself\r\nas an actress, and often mimicked some of the local characters, to the\r\napparent pleasure of my limited audience of family and neighbors. It was\r\nnot long before I slipped into declaiming. _The Lady of Lyons_ was one\r\nof my specialties:\r\n\r\n            This is thy palace, where the perfumed light\r\n            Steals through the mist of alabaster lamps,\r\n            And every air is heavy with the sighs\r\n            Of orange groves, and music from the sweet lutes\r\n            And murmurs of low fountains, that gush forth\r\n            I’ the midst of roses!\r\n\r\nAll outdoors was our playground, but I was not conscious at the time of\r\nmy love for the country. Things in childhood change perspective. What\r\nwas taken for granted then assumes great significance in later life. I\r\nknew how the oak tree grew and where the white and yellow violets could\r\nbe found, and with a slight feeling of superiority I showed and\r\nexpounded these mysteries to town children. Not until pavements were my\r\npaths did I realize how much a part of me the country was, and how I\r\nmissed it.\r\n\r\nWe were all, brothers and sisters alike, healthy and strong, vigorous\r\nand active; our appetites were curtailed only through necessity. We\r\nplayed the same games together and shared the same sports—baseball,\r\nskating, swimming, hunting. Nevertheless, except that we all had red\r\nhair, shading from carrot to bronze, we were sharply distinct\r\nphysically. The girls were small and feminine, the boys husky and\r\nbrawny. When I went out into the world and observed men, otherwise\r\nadmirable, who could not pound a nail or use a saw, pick, shovel, or ax,\r\nI was dumfounded. I had always taken for granted that any man could make\r\nthings with his hands.\r\n\r\nI expected this even of women. My oldest sister, Mary, possessed, more\r\nthan the rest of us, an innate charm and gentleness. She could do\r\nanything along domestic lines—embroidery, dress making, tailoring,\r\ncooking; she could concoct the most delicious and unusual foods, and mix\r\ndelicate pastries. But she was also an expert at upholstering,\r\ncarpentry, painting, roofing with shingles or with thatch. When Mary was\r\nin the house, we never had to send for a plumber. She rode gracefully\r\nand handled the reins from the carriage seat with equal dexterity; she\r\ncould milk a cow and deliver a baby; neighbors called her to tend their\r\nsick cattle, or, when death came, to lay out the body; she tutored in\r\nmathematics and Latin, and was well-read in the classics, yet she liked\r\nmost the theater, and was a dramatic critic whose judgment was often\r\nsought. In all that she did her sweetness and dearness were apparent,\r\nthough she performed her many kindnesses in secret. She left the home\r\nroof while I was still a child, but she never failed to send Christmas\r\nboxes in which every member of the family shared, each gift beautifully\r\nwrapped and decorated with ribbons and cards.\r\n\r\nMy brothers were ardent sportsmen, although they might not have been\r\noutstanding scholars. They could use their fists and were as good shots\r\nas their father. For that matter, we all knew how to shoot; any normal\r\nperson could manage a gun. Father was a great hunter. Our best times\r\nwere when friends of his came to spend the night, talking late, starting\r\nearly the next morning for the heavy woods which were full of foxes,\r\nrabbits, partridge, quail, and pheasant.\r\n\r\nSomeone was always cleaning and oiling a gun in the kitchen or carrying\r\nfood to the kennels. The boys were devoted to their fox and rabbit\r\nhounds, but father lavished his affection on bird dogs. Our favorite\r\ncame to us unsought, unbought, and I had a prideful part in his joining\r\nthe family. One afternoon I was sitting alone by the nameless brook\r\nwhich ran by our house, clear and cool, deep enough in some places to\r\ntake little swims on hot summer days. I was engaged in pinning together\r\nwith thorns a wreath of leaves to adorn my head when a large, white dog\r\nambled up, sniffed, wagged his tail, and seemed to want to belong. This\r\nwas no ordinary cur, but a well-bred English setter which had evidently\r\nbeen lost. How father would love him!\r\n\r\nEven though the dog had no collar, I was slightly uneasy as to my right\r\nof ownership. One conspicuous brown-red spot on the back of his neck\r\nsimplified my problem. Unobtrusively I slipped him into the barn, tied\r\nhim up, selected a brush, dipped it in one of the cans of paint always\r\non hand, and multiplied the one spot by ten. For a day, waiting for them\r\nto dry, I fed him well with food filched from the rations of the other\r\nkennel occupants, then led him forth, his hairy dots stiffened with\r\npaint, and offered him to father as a special present.\r\n\r\nAccepting the gift in the spirit in which it was intended, father\r\nadmired the dog’s points, and, with an unmistakable twinkle, lent\r\nhimself to a deception which, of course, could deceive nobody. When\r\nSaturday night came, the neighborhood looked the animal over; none knew\r\nhim so we named him Toss and admitted him to the house. Later he bred\r\nwith an Irish setter of no importance, and one of the resultant puppies,\r\nBeauty, shared his privileges.\r\n\r\nToss, as well as everybody else, subscribed to the idea that the\r\n“artist” in father must be catered to. With the first sound of his\r\nclearing his throat in the morning Toss picked up the shoes which had\r\nbeen left out to be cleaned, and carried them one at a time to the\r\nbedroom door, then stood wagging his tail, waiting to be patted.\r\nFather’s shoes were always polished, his trousers always creased. Every\r\nday, even when going to work, he put on spotless white shirts with\r\nstarched collars and attachable cuffs; these were something of a luxury,\r\nbecause they had to be laundered at home, but they got done somehow.\r\n\r\nFather took little or no responsibility for the minute details of the\r\ndaily tasks. I can see him when he had nothing on hand, laughing and\r\njoking or reading poetry. Mother, however, was everlastingly busy\r\nsewing, cooking, doing this and that. For so ardent and courageous a\r\nwoman he must have been trying, and I still wonder at her patience. She\r\nloved her children deeply, but no one ever doubted that she idolized her\r\nhusband, and through the years of her wedded life to her early death\r\nnever wavered in her constancy. Father’s devotion to mother, though\r\nequally profound, never evidenced itself in practical ways.\r\n\r\nThe relation existing between our parents was unusual for its day; they\r\nhad the idea of comradeship and not merely loved but liked and respected\r\neach other. There was no quarreling or bickering; none of us had to take\r\nsides, saying, “Father is right,” or, “Mother is right.” We knew that if\r\nwe pleased one we pleased the other, and such an atmosphere leaves its\r\nmark; we felt secure from emotional uncertainty, and were ourselves\r\nguided towards certainty in our future. We were all friends together,\r\nthough not in the modern sense of familiarity. A little dignity and\r\nformality were always maintained and we were invariably addressed by our\r\nfull names. The century of the child had not yet been ushered in.\r\n\r\nIn those days young people, unless invited to speak, were seen and not\r\nheard. But as soon as father considered us old enough to have ideas or\r\nopinions, we were given full scope to express them, no matter how\r\nadolescent. He hated the slavery of pattern and following of examples\r\nand believed in the equality of the sexes; not only did he come out\r\nstrongly for woman suffrage in the wake of Susan B. Anthony, but he\r\nadvocated Mrs. Bloomer’s bloomers as attire for women, though his wife\r\nand daughters never wore them. He fought for free libraries, free\r\neducation, free books in the public schools, and freedom of the mind\r\nfrom dogma and cant. Sitting comfortably with his feet on the table he\r\nused to say, “You should give something back to your country because you\r\nas a child were rocked in the cradle of liberty and nursed at the breast\r\nof the goddess of truth.” Father always talked like that.\r\n\r\nAlthough the first Socialist in the community, father also took single\r\ntax in his stride and became the champion and friend of Henry George.\r\n_Progress and Poverty_ was one of the latest additions to our meager\r\nbookshelf. He laughed and rejoiced when he came upon what to him were\r\nmeaty sentences, reading them aloud to mother, who accepted them as fine\r\nbecause he said they were fine. The rest of us all had to plow through\r\nthe book in order, as he said, to “elevate the mind.” To me it still\r\nremains one of the dullest ever written.\r\n\r\nMother’s loyalty to father was tested repeatedly. Hers were the\r\nresponsibilities of feeding and clothing and managing on his income,\r\ncombined with the earnings of the oldest children. But father’s\r\ngenerosity took no cognizance of fact. Once he was asked to buy a dozen\r\nbananas for supper. Instead, he purchased a stalk of fifteen dozen, and\r\non his way home gave every single one to schoolboys and girls playing at\r\nrecess. On another occasion he showed up with eight of a neighbor’s\r\nchildren; the ninth had been quarantined for diphtheria. They lived with\r\nus for two months, crowded into our beds, tucked in between us at the\r\ntable. Mother welcomed them as she did his other guests. The house was\r\nalways open. She was not so much social-minded as inherently hospitable.\r\nBut with her frail body and slim pocketbook, it took courage to smile.\r\n\r\nOnce only that I can remember did mother’s patience give way. That was\r\nwhen father invaded her realm too drastically and invited Henry George\r\nto lecture at the leading hotel—with banquet thrown in. From the money\r\nsaved for the winter coal he had taken enough to entertain fifty men\r\nwhose children were well-fed and well-clothed. This was the sole time I\r\never knew my parents to be at odds, though even then I heard no\r\nquarreling words. Whatever happened between them I was not sure, but\r\nfather spent several days wooing back the smile and light to her eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter Henry George’s visit we had to go without coal most of the winter.\r\n\r\nWith more pleasure than _Progress and Poverty_ I recall a _History of\r\nthe World_, _Lalla Rookh_, _Gulliver’s Travels_, and _Aesop’s Fables_.\r\nThe last-named touched a sympathetic, philosophical chord in father.\r\n“Wolf! Wolf!” and “Sour Grapes” were often used to exemplify the\r\ntrifling imperfections to which all human beings were subject. For his\r\nparables he drew also on the Bible, the most enormous volume you ever\r\nlaid eyes on, brass bound, with heavy clasps, which was the repository\r\nof the family statistics; every birth, marriage, death was entered\r\nthere. The handbooks to father’s work were the physiologies, one of\r\nwhich was combined with a materia medica. These were especially\r\nattractive to me, perhaps because they were illustrated with vivid\r\nplates, mostly red and blue, and described the fascinating, unknown\r\ninterior of the human body.\r\n\r\nNeighbors were constantly coming to father for help. “What do you think\r\nis the matter with this child?” Even without a thermometer he could tell\r\nby feeling the skin whether you were feverish. He prescribed bismuth if\r\nthe diagnosis were “summer complaint,” castor oil if you had eaten\r\nsomething which had disagreed with you, and always sulphur and molasses\r\nin the spring “to clean the blood.”\r\n\r\nFather’s cure-all was whiskey—“good whiskey,” which “liberated the\r\nspirit.” There was nothing from a deranged system to a depressed mind\r\nthat it could not fix up. He never drank alone, but no masculine guest\r\never entered the door or sat down to pass the time of day without his\r\nproducing the bottle. “Have a little shtimulant?”\r\n\r\nThe chief value of whiskey to father, however, was medicinal. If mumps\r\nturned into a large, ugly abscess, he put the blade of his jackknife in\r\nthe fire, lanced the gland, and cleaned the wound with whiskey—good\r\nwhiskey. When my face was swollen with erysipelas, he painted it\r\nmorning, afternoon, and evening with tincture of iodine; the doctor had\r\nso ordered. I was held firmly in place each time this torture was\r\ninflicted, and, as soon as released, jumped and ran screaming and\r\nhowling into the cellar, where I plunged my burning face into a pan of\r\ncool buttermilk until the pain subsided. This went on for several days,\r\nand I was growing exhausted from the dreaded iodine. Finally father\r\ndecided to abandon the treatment and substitute good whiskey. Then I\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAs necessary to father as the physiologies was a book by the famous\r\nphrenologist, Orson Fuller, under whom he had studied. Father believed\r\nimplicitly that the head was the sculptured expression of the soul.\r\nStraight or slanting eyes, a ridge between them, a turned-up nose, full\r\nlips, bulges in front of or behind the ears—all these traits had\r\ndefinite meaning for him. A research worker had to be inquisitive, a\r\nseeker with more than normal curiosity-bumps; a musician had to have\r\norder and time over the eyebrows; a pugilist could not be made but had\r\nto have the proper protuberances around the ears.\r\n\r\nOne of father’s phrases was, “Nature is the perfect sculptor; she is\r\nnever wrong. If you seem to have made a mistake in reading, it is\r\nbecause you have not read correctly.” He himself seldom made a mistake,\r\nand his reputation spread far and wide. Young men in confusion of mind\r\nand the customary puzzled, pre-graduation state came from Cornell and\r\nother colleges to consult him about their careers. He examined heads and\r\nfaces, told them where he thought their true vocations lay, and\r\nsupplemented this advice later with voluminous interested\r\ncorrespondence. I could not help picking up his principles and some of\r\nhis ardor, though I have never been able to analyze character so well.\r\nNo amount of front or salesmanship could divert him, whereas I have\r\noften been taken in by a person’s self-confidence and estimation of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the predominantly Roman Catholic community of Corning, set crosses in\r\nthe cemeteries were the rule for the poor and, before they went out of\r\nstyle, angels in various poses for the rich. I used to watch father at\r\nwork. The rough, penciled sketch indicated little; even less did the\r\nfirst unshaped block of stone. He played with the hard, unyielding\r\nmarble as though it were clay, making a tiny chip for a mouth, which\r\ngrew rounder and rounder. A face then emerged, a shoulder, a sweep of\r\ndrapery, praying hands, until finally the whole stood complete with\r\nwings and halo.\r\n\r\nAlthough Catholics were father’s best patrons, by nature and upbringing\r\nhe deplored their dogma. He joined the Knights of Labor, who were\r\nagitating against the influx of unskilled immigrants from Catholic\r\ncountries, and this did not endear him to his clientele. Still less did\r\nhis espousal of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll, a man after his own heart,\r\nwhose works he had eagerly studied and used as texts. Once when the\r\nchallenger was sounding a ringing defiance in near-by towns, father\r\nextended an invitation to speak in Corning and enlighten it. He\r\ncollected subscriptions to pay for the only hall in town, owned by\r\nFather Coghlan. A notice was inserted in the paper that the meeting\r\nwould be held the following Sunday, but chiefly the news spread by word\r\nof mouth. “Better come. Tell all your friends.”\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon arrived, and father escorted “Colonel Bob” from the\r\nhotel to the hall, I trotting by his side. We pushed through the waiting\r\ncrowd, but shut doors stared silently and reprovingly—word had also\r\nreached Father Coghlan.\r\n\r\nSome were there to hear and learn, others to denounce. Antipathies\r\nbetween the two suddenly exploded in action. Tomatoes, apples, and\r\ncabbage stumps began to fly. This was my first experience of rage\r\ndirected against those holding views which were contrary to accepted\r\nones. It was my first, but by no means my last. I was to encounter it\r\nmany times, and always with the same bewilderment and disdain. My father\r\napparently felt only the disdain. Resolutely he announced the meeting\r\nwould take place in the woods near our home an hour later, then led\r\nIngersoll and the “flock” through the streets. I trudged along again, my\r\nsmall hand clasped in his, my head held just as high.\r\n\r\nWho cared for the dreary, dark, little hall! In the woodland was room\r\nfor all. Those who had come for discussion sat spellbound on the ground\r\nin a ring around the standing orator. For them the booing had been\r\nincidental and was ignored. I cannot remember a word of what Colonel\r\nIngersoll said, but the scene remains. It was late in the afternoon, and\r\nthe tall pines shot up against the fiery radiance of the setting sun,\r\nwhich lit the sky with the brilliance peculiar to the afterglows of the\r\nChemung Valley.\r\n\r\nFlorid, gray-haired Father Coghlan, probably tall in his prime, came to\r\ncall on mother. He was a kindly old gentleman, not really intolerant.\r\nShutting the hall had been a matter of principle; he could not have an\r\natheist within those sacred walls. But he was willing to talk about it\r\nafterwards. In fact, he rather enjoyed arguing with rebels. He was full\r\nof persuasion which he used on mother, begging her to exercise her\r\ninfluence with father to make him refrain from his evil ways. She had\r\nbeen reared in the faith, although since her marriage to a freethinker\r\nwhich had so distressed her parents, she had never attended church to my\r\nknowledge. The priest was troubled to see her soul damned when she might\r\nhave been a good Catholic, and implored her to send her children to\r\nchurch and to the parochial school, to stand firm against the intrusion\r\nof godlessness. Mother must have suffered from the conflict.\r\n\r\nNone of us realized how the Ingersoll episode was to affect our\r\nwell-being. Thereafter we were known as children of the devil. On our\r\nway to school names were shouted, tongues stuck out, grimaces made; the\r\njuvenile stamp of disapproval had been set upon us. But we had been so\r\nsteeped in “heretic” notions that we were not particularly bothered by\r\nthis and could not see ahead into the dark future when a hard childhood\r\nwas to be made harder. No more marble angels were to be carved for local\r\nCatholic cemeteries, and, while father’s income was diminishing, the\r\nfamily was increasing.\r\n\r\nOccasionally big commissions were offered him in adjacent towns where\r\nhis reputation was still high, and he was then away for days at a time,\r\ncoming back with a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars in his pocket; we\r\nall had new clothes, and the house was full of plenty. Food was bought\r\nfor the winter—turnips, apples, flour, potatoes. But then again a year\r\nmight pass before he had another one, and meanwhile we had sunk deeply\r\ninto debt.\r\n\r\nTowards orthodox religion father’s own attitude remained one of\r\ntolerance. He looked upon the New Testament as the noble story of a\r\nhuman being which, because of ignorance and the lack of printing\r\npresses, had become exaggerated. He maintained that religions served\r\ntheir purpose; some people depended on them all their lives for\r\ndiscipline—to keep them straight, to make them honest. Others did not\r\nneed to be so held in line. But subjection to any church was a\r\nreflection on strength and character. You should be able to get from\r\nyourself what you had to go to church for.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked which Sunday School we should attend, he suggested, “Try\r\nthem all, but be chained to none.” For a year or two I made the rounds,\r\nespecially at Christmas and Easter, when you received oranges and little\r\nbags of candy. It was always cold at the Catholic church and the wooden\r\nbenches were very bare and hard; some seats were upholstered in soft,\r\nred cloth but these were for the rich, who rented the pews and put\r\ndollars into the plate at collection. I never liked to see the figure of\r\nJesus on the cross; we could not help Him because He had been crucified\r\nlong ago. I much preferred the Virgin Mary; she was beautiful,\r\nsmiling—the way I should like to look when I had a baby.\r\n\r\nSaying my prayers for mother’s benefit was spasmodic. Ethel, the sister\r\nnearest my own age, was more given than I to religious phases and I\r\ncould get her in bed faster if I said them with her. One evening when we\r\nhad finished this dutiful ritual I climbed on father’s chair to kiss him\r\ngood night. He asked quizzically, “What was that you were saying about\r\nbread?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that was in the Lord’s Prayer, ‘Give us this day our daily\r\nbread.’”\r\n\r\n“Who were you talking to?”\r\n\r\n“To God.”\r\n\r\n“Is God a baker?”\r\n\r\nI was shocked. Nevertheless, I rallied to the attack and replied as best\r\nI could, doubtless influenced by conversations I had heard. “No, of\r\ncourse not. It means the rain, the sunshine, and all the things to make\r\nthe wheat, which makes the bread.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he replied, “so that’s the idea. Then why don’t you say\r\nso? Always say what you mean, my daughter; it is much better.”\r\n\r\nThereafter I began to question what I had previously taken for granted\r\nand to reason for myself. It was not pleasant, but father had taught me\r\nto think. He gave none of us much peace. When we put on stout shoes he\r\nsaid, “Very nice. Very comfortable. Do you know who made them?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, the shoemaker.”\r\n\r\nWe then had to listen to graphic descriptions of factory conditions in\r\nthe shoe industry, so that we might learn something of the misery and\r\npoverty the workers suffered in order to keep our feet warm and dry.\r\n\r\nFather never talked about religion without bringing in the ballot box.\r\nIn fact, he took up Socialism because he believed it Christian\r\nphilosophy put into practice, and to me its ideals still come nearest to\r\ncarrying out what Christianity was supposed to do. Unceasingly he tried\r\nto inculcate in us the idea that our duty lay not in considering what\r\nmight happen to us after death, but in doing something here and now to\r\nmake the lives of other human beings more decent. “You have no right to\r\nmaterial comforts without giving back to society the benefit of your\r\nhonest experience,” was one of his maxims, and his parting words to each\r\nof his sons and daughters who had grown old enough to fend for\r\nthemselves were, “Leave the world better because you, my child, have\r\ndwelt in it.”\r\n\r\nThis was something to live up to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Two_\r\n\r\n                        BLIND GERM OF DAYS TO BE\r\n\r\n        “_I think, dearest Uncle, that you cannot _really_ wish\r\n        me to be the ‘mamma d’une nombreuse famille,’ for I\r\n        think you will see the great inconvenience a _large_\r\n        family would be to us all, and particularly to the\r\n        country, independent of the hardship and inconvenience\r\n        to myself; men never think, at least seldom think, what\r\n        a hard task it is for us women to go through this _very\r\n        often_._”\r\n\r\n                                QUEEN VICTORIA _to_ KING LEOPOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nOften when my brothers and sisters and I meet we remind each other of\r\nfunny or exciting adventures we used to have, but I never desire to live\r\nthat early part of my life again. Childhood is supposed to be a happy\r\ntime. Mine was difficult, though I did not then think of it as a\r\ndisadvantage nor do I now.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me to ask my parents for pocket money, but the day\r\ncame during my eighth year when I was desperately in want of ten cents.\r\n_Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ was coming to town. On Saturday afternoon I started\r\nout with one of my playmates, she with her dime, I with nothing but\r\nfaith. We reached the Corning Opera House half an hour early. The throng\r\nat the entrance grew thicker and thicker. Curtain time had almost come,\r\nand still no miracle. Nevertheless, I simply had to get into that\r\ntheater. All about me had tickets or money or both. Suddenly I felt\r\nsomething touch my arm—the purse of a woman who was pressed close beside\r\nme. It was open, and I could see the coveted coins within. One quick\r\nmove and I could have my heart’s desire. The longing was so deep and\r\nhard that it blotted out everything except my imperative need. I _had_\r\nto get into that theater.\r\n\r\nI was about to put out my hand towards the bag when the doors were\r\nthrown wide and the crowd precipitately surged forward. Being small, I\r\nwas shoved headlong under the ropes and into the safety of the nearest\r\nseat. But I could take no joy in the play.\r\n\r\nAs I lay sleepless that night, after a prayer of thanks for my many\r\nblessings, the crack of Simon Legree’s whip and the off-stage hounds\r\nbaying after Eliza were not occupying my mind. Their places were taken\r\nby pictures of the devil which had tempted me and the hand of God which\r\nhad been stretched out to save me from theft.\r\n\r\nFollowing this experience, which might have been called a spiritual\r\nawakening, I began to connect my desires with reasoning about\r\nconsequences. This was difficult, because my feelings were strong and\r\nurgent. I realized I was made up of two Me’s—one the thinking Me, the\r\nother, willful and emotional, which sometimes exercised too great a\r\npower; there was danger in her leadership and I set myself the task of\r\nuniting the two by putting myself through ordeals of various sorts to\r\nstrengthen the head Me.\r\n\r\nTo gain greater fortitude, I began to make myself do what I feared\r\nmost—go upstairs alone to bed without a light, go down cellar without\r\nsinging, get up on the rafters in the barn and jump on the haystack\r\nthirty feet below. When I was able to accomplish these without flinching\r\nI felt more secure and more strong within myself.\r\n\r\nBut ahead of me still lay the hardest task of all.\r\n\r\nAcross the Chemung some friends of ours had a farm. Their orchard, heavy\r\nwith delectable apples, seemed to me a veritable Eden. But to reach it\r\nby the wooden wagon bridge was three miles around; my brothers preferred\r\nthe shorter route over the high, narrow, iron span of the Erie Railroad,\r\nunder which the river raced deep and fast. The spaced ties held no\r\nterrors for their long legs, and they often swung them over the edge\r\nwhile they fished the stream beneath. When I made the trip father and\r\nbrother each gave a hand to which I clung fiercely, and they half lifted\r\nme over the gaps which my shorter legs could hardly compass unaided.\r\nHeld tight as I was, I became dizzy from the height, and a panic of\r\nterror seized me. In fact, the mere thought of the journey, even so well\r\nsupported, made me feel queer.\r\n\r\nThe younger children were forbidden to cross the bridge unaccompanied.\r\nBut I had to conquer my fear; I had to take that walk alone. I trembled\r\nas I drew near. The more I feared it, the more determined I was to make\r\nmyself do it. I can recall now how stoically I put one foot on the first\r\ntie and began the venturesome and precarious passage stretching\r\nendlessly ahead of me. I dared not look down at the water; I wanted\r\nterribly to see that my feet were firmly placed, but could not trust my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway over I heard the hum of the steel rails. My second dread\r\nhad come upon me—the always possible train. I could not see it because\r\nof the curve at the end of the bridge. The singing grew louder as it\r\ncame closer. I knew I could not get across in time, and turned towards\r\nthe nearest girder to which I might cling. But it was six feet away. The\r\nengine with a whistling shriek burst into view—snorting, huge, menacing,\r\nrushing. I stumbled and fell.\r\n\r\nIn those days I was plump, and this plumpness saved me. Instinctively my\r\narms went out and curled around the ties as I dropped between them.\r\nThere I dangled over space. The bridge shook; the thunder swelled; the\r\nlong, swift passenger cars swooped down. I was less than three feet from\r\nthe outer rail, and a new terror gripped me. I had seen the sharp,\r\nsizzling steam jet out as locomotives drew near the station. I screwed\r\nmy eyes shut and prayed the engineer not to turn on the steam.\r\n\r\nAfter the blur of wheels had crashed by I could feel nothing. I hung\r\nthere, I do not know how long, until a friend of my father, who had been\r\nfishing below, came to my rescue. He pulled up the fat, aching little\r\nbody, stood me on my feet again, asked me severely whether my father\r\nknew where I was, gave me two brisk thwacks on the bottom, turned my\r\nface towards home, and went back to his rod and line.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few moments to think matters over I realized that it\r\nwould be impossible for me to retrace my course. Common sense aided me.\r\nThe journey forward was no further than the journey back. I stepped\r\nahead far more bravely, knowing if I could reach the end of the bridge I\r\nwould never be so terrified again. Though bruised and sore I continued\r\nmy cautious march and had as good a time at the farm as usual.\r\n\r\nHowever, I returned home by the wooden bridge, the long way round, but\r\nthe practical one.\r\n\r\nWhen Ethel asked me that night why I was putting vaseline under my arms\r\nI merely said I had scratched myself. Foolhardiness was never highly\r\nesteemed by anyone in the family. Though resourcefulness was taken for\r\ngranted, running into unnecessary danger was just nonsense, and I wanted\r\nno censure for my disobedience.\r\n\r\nWe were seldom scolded, never spanked. If an unpleasant conversation\r\nwere needed, no other brother or sister was witness; neither parent ever\r\nhumiliated one child in front of another. This was part of the\r\nsensitiveness of both. Mother in particular had a horror of personal\r\nvehemence or acrimonious arguments; in trying to prevent or stop them\r\nshe would display amazing intrepidity—separating fighting dogs, fighting\r\nboys, even fighting men.\r\n\r\nPeacemaker as she was, on occasion she battled valiantly for her loved\r\nones, resenting bitterly the corporal punishment then customary in\r\nschools. Once my brother Joe came home with his hands so swollen and\r\nblistered that he could not do his evening chore of bringing in the\r\nwood. Mother looked carefully at them and asked him what had happened.\r\nHe explained that the teacher had fallen asleep and several boys had\r\nstarted throwing spitballs. When one had hit her on the nose she had\r\nawakened with a little scream.\r\n\r\nMost children had the trick of burying their faces behind their big\r\ngeographies and appearing to be studying the page with the most innocent\r\nair in the world. But Joe had no such technique. He was doubled up with\r\nlaughter. The teacher first accused him of throwing the spitball, and,\r\nwhen he denied it, insisted that he name the culprit. She had been\r\nembarrassed by her ridiculous situation, and had turned her emotion into\r\nwhat she considered righteous indignation. Joe had paid the penalty of\r\nbeing beaten for his unwillingness to violate the schoolboy code of\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nThis was injustice and the surest road to mother’s wrath. She started at\r\nonce the long trip to the school. When she found no one there, she\r\nwalked more miles to the teacher’s home. Reproof was called for and she\r\nadministered it. But that was not enough. She then demanded that father\r\ngo to the Board of Education and take Joe with him. There would have\r\nbeen no sleeping in the house with her had he not done so. An\r\ninvestigation was promised, which soon afterwards resulted in the\r\nteacher’s dismissal.\r\n\r\nThe teachers at the Corning School were no worse than others of their\r\nday; many of them were much better. The brick building was quite modern\r\nfor the time, with a playground around it and good principals to guide\r\nit. Its superiority was due in part to the influence of the Houghtons,\r\nthe big industrialists of the town. For three generations they had been\r\nmaking glassware unsurpassed for texture and beauty of design, and\r\nhardly a family of means in the country did not have at least one\r\ncut-glass centerpiece from Corning. The factories had prospered during\r\nthe kerosene lamp era, and now, with electricity coming into its own,\r\nthey were working overtime blowing light bulbs.\r\n\r\nCorning was not on the whole a pleasant town. Along the river flats\r\nlived the factory workers, chiefly Irish; on the heights above the\r\nrolling clouds of smoke that belched from the chimneys lived the owners\r\nand executives. The tiny yards of the former were a-sprawl with\r\nchildren; in the gardens on the hills only two or three played. This\r\ncontrast made a track in my mind. Large families were associated with\r\npoverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, fighting, jails; the\r\nsmall ones with cleanliness, leisure, freedom, light, space, sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe fathers of the small families owned their homes; the young-looking\r\nmothers had time to play croquet with their husbands in the evenings on\r\nthe smooth lawns. Their clothes had style and charm, and the fragrance\r\nof perfume clung about them. They walked hand in hand on shopping\r\nexpeditions with their children, who seemed positive in their right to\r\nlive. To me the distinction between happiness and unhappiness in\r\nchildhood was one of small families and of large families rather than of\r\nwealth and poverty.\r\n\r\nIn our home, too, we felt the economic pressure directly ascribable to\r\nsize. I was always apprehensive that we might some day be like the\r\nfamilies on the flats, because we always had another baby coming,\r\nanother baby coming. A new litter of puppies was interesting but not out\r\nof the ordinary; so, likewise, the cry of a new infant never seemed\r\nunexpected. Neither excited any more curiosity than breakfast or dinner.\r\nNo one ever told me how they were born. I just knew.\r\n\r\nI was little more than eight when I first helped wash the\r\nfourteen-and-a-half-pound baby after one of mother’s deliveries. She had\r\nhad a “terrible hard time,” but father had pulled her through, and, in a\r\nfew weeks, tired and coughing, she was going about her work, believing\r\nas usual that her latest was the prize of perfect babies. Mother’s\r\neleven children were all ten-pounders or more, and both she and father\r\nhad a eugenic pride of race. I used to hear her say that not one of hers\r\nhad a mark or blemish, although she had the utmost compassion for those\r\nwho might have cleft palates, crossed eyes, or be “born sick.”\r\n\r\nLate one night a woman rushed into our house, seeking protection,\r\nclutching in her shawl a scrawny, naked baby, raw with eczema. When her\r\nhysteria was calmed sufficiently we learned that her husband had reeled\r\nhome drunk and had thrown the wailing infant out into the snow. Father\r\nwas all for summoning the police, but mother was too wise for that. She\r\ndispatched him to talk to the man while she gave the weeping woman a\r\nwarm supper and comforted her. Father returned shortly to say it was\r\nsafe for her to go back to the multitude of other children because her\r\nhusband had fallen asleep. Ugly and taciturn though he was I could\r\npicture him coming home after a hard day’s work to a household racked\r\nwith the shrieks of the suffering little thing. I could see that he too\r\nwas pathetic and a victim; I had sympathy for his rage.\r\n\r\nBut mother did lose one of her beautiful babies. Henry George McGlynn\r\nHiggins had been named for two of the rebel figures father most admired.\r\nThe four-year-old was playing happily in the afternoon; a few hours\r\nlater he was gasping for breath. Father heated his home-made croup\r\nkettle on the stove until it boiled, and then carried it steaming to be\r\nput under the blanket which rose like a covered wagon above the bed. As\r\nsoon as he realized that home remedies were failing he sent for the\r\ndoctor. But events moved too swiftly for him. We had gone to bed with no\r\nsuspicion that by morning we should be one less. I was shocked and\r\nsurprised that something could come along and pick one of us out of the\r\nworld in so few hours.\r\n\r\nI had no time, however, to consider the bewildering verity of death. We\r\nall had to turn to consoling mother. Perhaps unconsciously she had\r\nsubscribed to father’s theory that the face was the mirror to the soul.\r\nShe complained she had no picture of her lovely boy, and kept reminding\r\nherself of the fine shape of his head, the wide, well-set eyes, the\r\nfamiliar contours which had been wiped forever from her sight, and might\r\nsoon be sponged from her memory as well.\r\n\r\nMother’s grief over her lost child increased father’s. Because in part\r\nhe blamed himself, he was desperate to assuage her sorrow. The day after\r\nthe burial he was constantly occupied in his studio, and when evening\r\nfell he took me affectionately by the hand asking me to stay up and help\r\nhim on a piece of work he was about to do. I agreed willingly.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock we went forth together into the pitch-black night,\r\nfather pushing ahead of him a wheelbarrow full of tools and a bag of\r\nplaster of Paris. We walked on and on through the stillness for fully\r\ntwo miles to the cemetery where the little brother had been buried.\r\nFather knew every step, but it was scary and I clung to his hand.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the gateway father hid the lighted lantern in the near-by\r\nbushes over a grave and told me to wait there unless I heard somebody\r\ncoming. He expected me to be grown up at the age of ten. Nerves meant\r\nsickness; if any child cried out in the night it was merely considered\r\n“delicate.” Consequently I obeyed and watched, shivering with cold and\r\nexcitement, darting quick glances at the ghostly forms of some of\r\nfather’s monuments which loomed out of the darkness around me. I could\r\nhear the steady chunk, chunk, chunk of his pick and shovel, and the\r\nsharper sound when suddenly he struck the coffin.\r\n\r\nFather had taken it as a matter of course that I should understand and\r\nhad not explained what he was about to do. But I never questioned his\r\nactions. I did not know there was a law against a man’s digging up his\r\nown dead child but, even had I known, I would have believed that the law\r\nwas wrong.\r\n\r\nWe traveled back the long, weary way, arriving home in the early hours\r\nof the morning. Nothing was said to mother or to the others about that\r\namazing night’s adventure; I was not told to keep silent, but I knew\r\nthere was mystery in the air and it was no time to talk.\r\n\r\nFor two evenings I worked with father, helping him break the death mask,\r\nmold and shape the cast. I remember the queer feeling I had when I\r\ndiscovered some of the hair which had stuck in the plaster. On the third\r\nday, just after supper, father said to us all, “Will you come into the\r\nstudio?” With tender eyes on mother he uncovered and presented to her\r\nthe bust of the dead little boy.\r\n\r\nShe was extraordinarily comforted. Though to me the model, perfect as it\r\nwas, seemed lifeless, every once in a while she entered the studio, took\r\noff the cloth which protected it from the dust, wept and was relieved,\r\nrecovered it and went on.\r\n\r\nNot one of us dared to utter a word of criticism about mother’s adored\r\nand adoring husband; nevertheless her soul was harassed at times by his\r\nphilosophy of live and let live, by his principles against locked doors\r\nand private property. She was merely selfless. Often when one of her\r\nchildren was feverish she went to the kitchen pump for water so that it\r\nmight be cooler and fresher for parched lips. Once, groping her way on\r\nsuch an errand, she stumbled over a tramp who had taken advantage of the\r\nunlatched door and lay sprawled on the floor. She rushed back to arouse\r\nfather, telling him he must put the man out. But he only turned over on\r\nhis side and muttered, “Oh, let him alone. The poor divil needs sleep\r\nlike the rest of us.”\r\n\r\nAnother night mother was awakened by noises outside. “Father,” she\r\ncalled, “there’s somebody at the hencoop!”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think so?” he answered sleepily.\r\n\r\n“I hear the chickens. They wouldn’t make a noise unless somebody was in\r\nthere. Get up!”\r\n\r\nObediently father put on his trousers and coat; not even before thieves\r\nwould he appear in his nightshirt out of his bedroom. He proceeded to\r\nthe kitchen door, and, holding a lamp on high, addressed the two men,\r\none of whom was handing out chickens to the other, “Hey, you, there!\r\nWhat do you mean by coming to a man’s house in the middle of the night\r\nand shtealing his chickens? What kind of citizens are you?”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to mother no time for a moral lecture. “Why don’t you go\r\nout?” she prodded.\r\n\r\n“It’s raining.”\r\n\r\n“Give me the lamp!” she demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\nShe started towards our nearest neighbor, splashing through the little\r\nbrook, getting her feet wet, calling, “Some one’s in our chicken house!”\r\n\r\nOur neighbor armed himself and came running. A man with a gun sent the\r\nmarauders scurrying up the hill. That was mother’s philosophy. I think\r\nfather fell in her estimation for a few days after this. She expected\r\nhim to be the guardian of the home, but he was never that. His liberal\r\nviews were so well known that our house was marked with the tramp’s\r\npatrin of the first degree. “Always get something here. Never be turned\r\naway.” If it happened to be pay day they could count on a quarter as\r\nwell as a meal.\r\n\r\nOne particular evening we were expecting father home, his pockets\r\nbulging with the money from his latest commission, but by nightfall he\r\nhad not yet returned. When mother heard a rap at the door she went\r\neagerly to open it. Two ragged strangers were standing there.\r\n\r\n“Is the boss in?”\r\n\r\n“No, but I’m looking for him any minute.”\r\n\r\n“We want something to eat.”\r\n\r\nWith no more ceremony than was customary among the knights of the open\r\nroad they pushed through the door and made for the kitchen, plainly\r\nknowing their way about.\r\n\r\n“How dare you come into this house!” exclaimed mother indignantly.\r\n“Toss! Beauty!” she cried sharply. The fear in her voice brought the\r\ndogs lunging downstairs with fangs bared and hackles bristling. They\r\nleaped at the backs of the uninvited guests.\r\n\r\nFather came in a few hours later. The door was swinging wide, the snow\r\nwas blowing in. Torn scraps of clothing, spots of blood were about, and\r\nmother was unconscious on the floor. He poured whiskey down her throat.\r\n“It was only good whiskey that brought you to,” he often said\r\nafterwards, recalling his alarm. He used the same remedy to pull her\r\nthrough the ensuing six weeks of pneumonia. But he had been so\r\nthoroughly worried that his generosity towards tramps lessened and his\r\nlargesse was curtailed.\r\n\r\nAfter this illness mother coughed more than ever and it was evident the\r\npines were not helping her. Father decided to move; the house was so\r\nobviously marked and he had to be gone so much he thought it unsafe for\r\nus to live alone so far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Three_\r\n\r\n                        BOOKS ARE THE COMPASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we moved into town, still on the western hills. It marked the\r\nbeginning of my adolescence, and such breaks are always disturbing. In\r\nthe house in the woods we had all been children together, but now some\r\nof us were growing up.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were always smaller ones to be put to bed, to be\r\nrocked to sleep; there were feet and knees to be scrubbed and hands to\r\nbe washed. Although we had more space, home study sometimes seemed to me\r\nimpossible. The living room was usually occupied by the older members of\r\nthe family, and the bedrooms were cold. I kept up in my lessons, but it\r\nwas simply because I enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nIn most schools teachers and pupils then were natural enemies, and the\r\none I had in the eighth grade was particularly adept at arousing\r\nantagonism. She apparently disliked her job and the youngsters under her\r\ncare as much as we hated her. Sarcasm was both her defense and weapon of\r\nattack. One day in mid-June I was delayed in getting off for school.\r\nWell aware that being tardy was a heinous crime, I hurried, pulling and\r\ntugging at my first pair of kid gloves, which Mary had just given me.\r\nBut the bell had rung two minutes before I walked into the room, flushed\r\nand out of breath.\r\n\r\nThe teacher had already begun the class. She looked up at the\r\ninterruption. “Well, well, Miss Higgins, so your ladyship has arrived at\r\nlast! Ah, a new pair of gloves! I wonder that she even deigns to come to\r\nschool at all.”\r\n\r\nGiggles rippled around me as I went into the cloakroom and laid down my\r\nhat and gloves. I came back, praying the teacher would pay no more\r\nattention to me, but as I walked painfully to my seat she continued\r\nrepeating with variations her mean comments. Even when I sat down she\r\ndid not stop. I tried to think of something else, tried not to listen,\r\ntried to smile with the others. I endured it as long as I could, then\r\ntook out my books, pyramiding arithmetic, grammar, and speller, strapped\r\nthem up, rose, and left.\r\n\r\nMother was amazed when I burst in on her. “I will never go back to that\r\nschool again!” I exclaimed dramatically. “I have finished forever! I’ll\r\ngo to jail, I’ll work, I’ll starve, I’ll die! But back to that school\r\nand teacher I will never go!”\r\n\r\nAs older brothers and sisters drifted home in the evening, they were as\r\nhorrified as mother. “But you have only two weeks more,” they\r\nexpostulated.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care if it’s only an hour. I will not go back!”\r\n\r\nWhen it became obvious that I would stick to my point, mother seemed\r\nglad to have me to help her. I was thorough and strong and could get\r\nthrough a surprising amount of work in no time. But the rest of the\r\nfamily was seriously alarmed. The next few months were filled with\r\nquestions I could not answer. “What can you ever be without an\r\neducation?” “Are you equipped to earn a living?” “Is factory life a\r\npleasant prospect? If you don’t go back to school, you’ll surely end\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ll go to work!” I announced defiantly. Work, even in the\r\nfactory, meant money, and money meant independence. I had no rebuttal to\r\ntheir arguments; I was acting on an impulse that transcended reason, and\r\nmust have recognized that any explanation as to my momentous decision\r\nwould sound foolish.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly father, mother, my second older sister Nan, and Mary, who\r\nhad been summoned to a family council, tried other tactics. I was sent\r\nfor two weeks to Chautauqua, there to take courses, hear lectures from\r\nprominent speakers, listen to music. This was designed to stimulate my\r\ninterest in education and dispel any idea I might have of getting a job.\r\n\r\nMy impulse had been misconstrued. I was not rebelling against education\r\nas such, but only against that particular school and that particular\r\nteacher. When fall drew near and the next session was at hand I was\r\nstill reiterating that I would not go back, although I still had no\r\nanswer to Nan’s repeated, “What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\nNan was perhaps the most inspiring of all my brothers and sisters. The\r\nexact contrary to father, she wanted us all to conform and was in tears\r\nif we did not. To her, failure in this respect showed a lack of\r\nbreeding. Yet even more important than conformity was knowledge, which\r\nwas the basis for all true culture. She herself wanted to write, and had\r\nreceived prizes for stories from _St. Nicholas_ and the _Youth’s\r\nCompanion_. But the family was too dependent upon the earnings of the\r\nolder girls, and she was obliged to postpone college and her equally\r\nardent desire to study sculpture. She became a translator of French and\r\nGerman until these aspirations could be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my mutiny Nan was especially disturbed. “You won’t be\r\nable to get anywhere without an education,” she stated firmly. She and\r\nMary, joining forces, together looked for a school, reasonable enough\r\nfor their purses, but good enough academically to prepare me for\r\nCornell. Private education was not so expensive as today, and families\r\nof moderate means could afford it. My sisters selected Claverack College\r\nand Hudson River Institute, about three miles from the town of Hudson in\r\nthe Catskill Mountains. Here, in one of the oldest coeducational\r\ninstitutions in the country, the Methodist farmers of the Dutch valley\r\nenrolled their sons and daughters; unfortunately it is now gone and with\r\nit the healthy spirit it typified. One sister paid my tuition and the\r\nother bought my books and clothes; for my board and room I was to work.\r\n\r\nGoing away to school was epochal in my life. The self-contained family\r\ngroup was suddenly multiplied to five hundred strangers, all living and\r\nstudying under one roof. The girls’ dormitory was at one end, the boys’\r\nat the other, but we shared the same dining room and sat together in\r\nclasses; occasionally a boy could call on a girl in the reception hall\r\nif a teacher were present. I liked best the attitude of the teachers;\r\nthey were not so much policemen as companions and friends, and their\r\ninstruction was more individual and stimulating than at Corning.\r\n\r\nI did not have money to do things the other girls did—go off for\r\nweek-ends or house-parties—but waiting on table or washing dishes did\r\nnot set me apart. The work was far easier than at home, and a girl was\r\npretty well praised for doing her share. At first the students all\r\nappeared to me uninteresting and lacking in initiative. I never found\r\nthe same imaginative quality I was used to in my family, but as certain\r\nones began to stand out I discovered they had personalities of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI had been at Claverack only a few days and was still feeling homesick\r\nwhen in the hall one morning I encountered the most beautiful creature I\r\nhad ever seen. Long hair flying from her shoulders, she was so slender\r\nand wraithlike that she seemed unreal. I have never since been so moved\r\nby human loveliness as I was by Esther’s. I cried at night because I\r\nsensed it was something I could not reach. Even her clothes were unlike\r\nall others. Many girls envied their taste and quality, but I knew they\r\nbelonged to her of right. Of every book I had read she was the heroine\r\ncome alive.\r\n\r\nWorlds apart though we were in tradition, looks, behavior, experience,\r\nEsther and I had the same romantic outlook. Having aspirations for the\r\ntheater, she remained only one year and then left to attend Charles\r\nFrohman’s dramatic school. I had been too overpowered by my admiration\r\nfor her to be happy in it, and it kept me from caring particularly about\r\nanyone else. Nevertheless, I am convinced that in any interchange of\r\naffection the balance is unequal; one must give and the other be able to\r\nreceive. My second year I was the recipient of devotion from a younger\r\ngirl similar to that I had showered upon Esther. The loyalty and praise\r\nof Amelia Stuart, my laughing friend, fed all the empty spaces in my\r\nheart. She was gay and clever, a Methodist by upbringing but not by\r\nconviction. Each Sunday afternoon, given over to the reading of the\r\nBible, we received permission to study together in my room, and there\r\noccupied ourselves dutifully, I in mending and darning, and she reading\r\naloud, but interspersing solemn passages with ridiculous exaggerations.\r\nWhat was intended to be a serious exercise of the spirit was turned into\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\nMy friendship with these two girls has been interrupted, but never\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after my arrival at Claverack I had been infected by that\r\nindefinable, nebulous quality called school spirit, and before long was\r\nhappily in the thick of activities. Assembly was held in the chapel\r\nevery morning, during which we all in turn had to render small speeches\r\nand essays, or recite selections of poetry. I had a vivid feeling of how\r\nthings should be said, putting more dramatic fervor into certain lines\r\nthan my limited experience of the theater would seem to explain, and on\r\nthis account the elocution teacher encouraged me to have faith in my\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nEvery girl, I suppose, at some time or other wants to be an actress.\r\nMary had taken me to the theater now and then, once when Maude Adams was\r\nplaying Juliet to John Drew’s Romeo, and had gone to some pains to\r\nexplain to me the difference between artistes like Mary Anderson or\r\nJulia Marlowe and mere beauty as such. She would not have been pleased\r\nat my seeing Lillian Russell, which I did during a Christmas holiday in\r\nNew York; Lillian Russell was too glamorous and, furthermore, she was\r\nsaid to have accepted jewelry from men.\r\n\r\nOne vacation I announced to my family that I was thinking of a stage\r\ncareer. Disapproval was evident on all sides. Father pooh-poohed; Mary\r\nalone held out hope. She said I had ability and should go to dramatic\r\nschool in New York as soon as I had finished Claverack. She would apply\r\nimmediately to Charles Frohman to have me understudy Maude Adams, whom I\r\nat least was said to resemble physically—small and with the same\r\nabundant red-brown hair. Lacking good features I took pride only in my\r\nthick, long braids. I used to decorate them with ribbons and admire the\r\neffect in the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe application was made; I was photographed in various poses with and\r\nwithout hats. A return letter from the school management came, enclosing\r\na form to be filled in with name, address, age, height, weight, color of\r\nhair, eyes, and skin.\r\n\r\nBut additional data were required as to the exact length of the legs,\r\nboth right and left, as well as measurements of ankle, calf, knee, and\r\nthigh. I knew my proportions in a general way. Those were the days when\r\nevery pack of cigarettes carried a bonus in the shape of a pictured\r\nactress, plump and well-formed. In the gymnasium the girls had compared\r\nsizes with these beauties. But to see such personal information go\r\ncoldly down on paper to be sent off to strange men was unthinkable. I\r\nhad expected to have to account for the quality of my voice, for my\r\nability to sing, to play, for grace, agility, character, and morals.\r\nSince I could not see what legs had to do with being a second Maude\r\nAdams, I did not fill in the printed form nor send the photographs, but\r\njust put them all away, and turned to other fields where something\r\nbeside legs was to count.\r\n\r\nChapel never bored me. I had come to dislike ritual in many of the\r\nchurches I had visited—kneeling for prayer, sitting for instruction,\r\nstanding for praise. But in a Methodist chapel anyone could get up and\r\nexpress a conviction. Young sprouts here were thinking and discussing\r\nthe Bible, religion, and politics. Should the individual be submerged in\r\nthe state? If you had a right to free thought as an individual, should\r\nyou give it up to the church?\r\n\r\nWe scribbled during study periods, debated in the evenings. Without\r\nalways digesting them but with great positiveness I carried over many of\r\nthe opinions I had heard expounded at home. To most of the boys and\r\ngirls those Saturday mornings when the more ambitious efforts were\r\noffered represented genuine torture. They stuttered and stammered\r\npainfully. I was just as nervous—more so probably. Nevertheless, I was\r\nso ardent for suffrage, for anything which would “emancipate” women and\r\nhumanity, that I was eager to proclaim theories of my own.\r\n\r\nFather was still the spring from which I drank, and I sent long letters\r\nhome, getting in reply still longer ones, filled with ammunition about\r\nthe historical background of the importance of women—Helen of Troy,\r\nRuth, Cleopatra, Poppaea, famous queens, women authors and poets.\r\n\r\nWhen news spread that I was to present my essay, “Women’s Rights,” the\r\nboys, following the male attitude which most people have forgotten but\r\nwhich every suffragette well remembers, jeered and drew cartoons of\r\nwomen wearing trousers, stiff collars, and smoking huge cigars.\r\nUndeterred, I was spurred on to think up new arguments. I studied and\r\nwrote as never before, stealing away to the cemetery and standing on the\r\nmonuments over the graves. Each day in the quiet of the dead I repeated\r\nand repeated that speech out loud. What an essay it was!\r\n\r\n“Votes for Women” banners were not yet flying, and this early faint\r\nbleating of mine aroused little enthusiasm. I turned then to an equally\r\nstern subject. The other students had automatically accepted the cause\r\nof solid money. I espoused free silver. At Chautauqua I had heard echoes\r\nof those first notes sounded by Bryan for the working classes. The\r\nspirit of humanitarianism in industry had been growing and swelling, but\r\nit was still deep buried. I believe any great concept must be present in\r\nthe mass consciousness before any one figure can tap it and set it free\r\non its irresistible way.\r\n\r\nI had not seen the “Boy Orator of the Platte,” but the country was\r\nringing with his words, “You shall not press down upon the brow of labor\r\nthis crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of\r\ngold.” These rich and sonorous phrases made me realize the importance of\r\nclothing ideas in fine language. Far more, however, they struck a solemn\r\nchord within me. I, also, in an obscure and unformed way, wanted to help\r\ngrasp Utopia from the skies and plant it on earth. But what to do and\r\nwhere to start I did not know.\r\n\r\nDue to my “advanced ideas,” for a time, at least, I am sorry to say, it\r\nwas chiefly the grinds with whom I “walked in Lovers’ Lane,” nodding\r\nwisely and answering their earnest aspirations with profound advice. But\r\nthis did not last. Soon I was going through the usual boy and girl\r\nromances; each season brought a new one. I took none of them very\r\nseriously, but adroitly combined flirtatiousness with the conviction\r\nthat marriage was something towards which I must develop. Therefore I\r\nturned the vague and tentative suggestions of my juvenile beaus by\r\nsaying, “I would never think of jumping into marriage without definite\r\npreparation and study of its responsibilities.” Practically no women\r\nthen went into professions; matrimony was the only way out. It seems\r\nages ago.\r\n\r\nVarious pranks occurred at Claverack, such as taking walks with boys out\r\nof bounds and going to forbidden places for tea. Towards the end of my\r\nlast year I thought up the idea that several of us should slip out\r\nthrough the window and down to the village dance hall where our special\r\nadmirers would meet us. About eleven-thirty, in the midst of the gayety,\r\nin walked our principal, Mr. Flack, together with the preceptress who\r\nhad come for the “ladies.” We were all marched back to school, uneasy\r\nbut silent.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I received a special invitation to call at The Office.\r\nI entered. Mr. Flack, a small, slight, serious, student type of man,\r\nwith a large head and high brow, was standing with his back to me. I sat\r\ndown. He gave me no greeting but kept on at his books. To all\r\nappearances he did not know I was there. Then, without looking around,\r\nhe said, “Miss Higgins, don’t you feel rather ashamed of yourself for\r\ngetting those girls into trouble last night, by taking them out and\r\nmaking them break the rules? They may even have to be sent home.”\r\n\r\nAlthough surprised that he should have known I was the one responsible,\r\nI could not deny it, but it flashed across my mind at first that someone\r\nmust have told him. He went on with rapid flow, almost as though talking\r\nto himself, “I’ve watched you ever since you came and I don’t need to be\r\ntold that you must have been the ringleader. Again and again I’ve\r\nnoticed your influence over others. I want to call your attention to\r\nthis, because I know you’re going to use it in the future. You must make\r\nyour choice—whether to get yourself and others into difficulty, or else\r\nguide yourself and others into constructive activities which will do you\r\nand them credit.”\r\n\r\nI do not quite recall what else he said, but I have never forgotten\r\ngoing out of his room that day. This could not exactly be called a\r\nturning point in my life, but from then on I realized more strongly than\r\nbefore that there was a something within myself which could and should\r\nbe kept under my control and direction.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards I wrote to thank Mr. Flack for his wisdom in offering\r\nguidance instead of harsh discipline. He died a few years later, and I\r\nwas glad I had been able to place a rose in his hand rather than on his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nI spent three happy years at Claverack. The following season I decided\r\nto try my hand at teaching, then a lady-like thing to do. A position was\r\nopen to me in the first grade of a new public school in southern New\r\nJersey. The majority of the pupils—Poles, Hungarians, Swedes—could not\r\nspeak English. In they came regularly. I was beside myself to know what\r\nto do with eighty-four children who could not understand a word I said.\r\nI loved those small, black-haired and tow-headed urchins who became\r\nbored with sitting and, on their own, began stunts to entertain\r\nthemselves. But I was so tired at the end of the day that I often lay\r\ndown before dressing for dinner and awakened the next morning barely in\r\ntime to start the routine. In very short order I became aware of the\r\nfact that teaching was not merely a job, it was a profession, and\r\ntraining was necessary if you were to do it well. I was not suited by\r\ntemperament, and therefore had no right to this vocation. I had been\r\nstruggling for only a brief while when father summoned me home to nurse\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nShe was weak and pale and the high red spots on her cheek bones stood\r\nout startlingly against her white face. Although she was now spitting\r\nblood when she coughed we still expected her to live on forever. She had\r\nbeen ill so long; this was just another attack among many. Father\r\ncarried her from room to room, and tried desperately to devise little\r\ncomforts. We shut the doors and windows to keep out any breath of the\r\nraw March air, and in the stuffy atmosphere we toiled over her bed.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to be more efficient in caring for mother I tried to find\r\nout something about consumption by borrowing medical books from the\r\nlibrary of the local doctor, who was a friend of the family, and in\r\ndoing this became so interested in medicine that I decided definitely I\r\nwould study to be an M.D. When I went back for more volumes and\r\nannounced my decision the doctor gave them to me, but smiled tolerantly,\r\n“You’ll probably get over it.”\r\n\r\nI had been closely confined for a long time when I was invited to\r\nBuffalo for the Easter holidays to meet again one of the boys by whom I\r\nhad been beaued at Claverack. Mother insisted that I needed a vacation.\r\nMary and Nan were both there; I could stay with them, and we planned a\r\npleasant trip to Niagara Falls for the day.\r\n\r\nWith me out of the way mother sent off the little children one by one on\r\nsome pretext or another. She had more difficulty with father. The fire\r\nbricks in the stove had split and she told him he must go to town and\r\nget new ones. Much against his will, because he was vaguely unquiet, he\r\nstarted for the foundry. He had left only because mother seemed to want\r\nit so much, but when he had walked a few blocks, he found he could not\r\ngo on. For some Celtic mystic reason of his own he turned abruptly\r\naround and came back to the house. Mother was gasping in death. All the\r\nfamily hated scenes, she most of all. She had known she was to die and\r\nwanted to be alone.\r\n\r\nIt was a folk superstition that a consumptive who survived through the\r\nmonth of March would live until November. Mother died on the\r\nthirty-first of the month, leaving father desolate and inconsolable. I\r\ncame flying home. The house was silent and he hardly spoke. Suddenly the\r\nstillness of the night was broken by a wailing and Toss was found with\r\nhis paws on the coffin, mourning and howling—the most poignant and\r\nagonizing sound I had ever heard.\r\n\r\nI had to take mother’s place—manage the finances, order the meals, pay\r\nthe debts. There was nothing left for my clothing nor for any outside\r\ndiversions. All that could be squeezed out by making this or that do had\r\nto go for shoes or necessities for the younger brothers. Mend, patch,\r\nsew as you would, there was a limit to the endurance of trousers, and\r\nnew ones had to be purchased.\r\n\r\nTo add to my woes, father seemed to me, who was sensitive to criticism,\r\nsuddenly metamorphosed from a loving, gentle, benevolent parent into a\r\nmost aggravating, irritating tyrant; nobody in any fairy tale I had ever\r\nread was quite so cruel. He who had given us the world in which to roam\r\nnow apparently wanted to put us behind prison bars. His unreasonableness\r\nwas not directed towards the boys, who were in bed as soon as lessons\r\nwere done, but towards his daughters, Ethel and me. Whatever we did was\r\nwrong. He objected particularly to young men.\r\n\r\nEthel was receiving the concentrated attention of Jack Byrne. Father in\r\nscolding her said she should mix more. My beaus were a little older than\r\nthe ones I had had at school, and more earnest in their intentions.\r\nThough not one really interested me—their conversation seemed flat,\r\nconsisting of foolish questions and smart, silly replies—father scolded\r\nme also about them, “Why aren’t you serious like your sister? Can’t you\r\nsettle yourself to one? Do you have to have somebody different every\r\nevening?”\r\n\r\nMessages were coming to me from a young man going West, postmarked\r\nChicago or San Francisco. These daily letters and sometimes telegrams as\r\nwell, were not father’s idea of wooing. What could anyone have to say\r\nevery day? To his way of thinking, a decent man came to the house and\r\ndid his talking straight; he sat around with the family and got\r\nacquainted. Father said, “That fellow’s a scoundrel. He’s too worldly.\r\nHe’s not even known in town.”\r\n\r\nWe had to ask permission whether Tom or Jack or Henry could call.\r\nWithout reason or explanation father said, “No,” and that was an end to\r\nit. If we went out, we had to be back at ten and give an account of\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThen came the climax. Ethel and I had gone to an open-air concert. On\r\nthe stroke of ten we were a full block away from home running with all\r\nour might. When we arrived, three minutes late, the house was in utter\r\ndarkness—not a sight nor sound of a living creature anywhere. We banged\r\nand knocked. We tried the front door, the back, and the side, then again\r\nthe front. It opened part way; father looked out, reached forth a hand\r\nand caught Ethel’s arm, saying, “This outrageous behavior is not your\r\nfault. Come in.” With that he pulled her inside, and the door slammed,\r\nleaving me in the dark, stunned and bewildered. I did not know this\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nHurt beyond words, I sat down on the steps, worrying not only about this\r\nnight but about the next day and the next, concerned over the children\r\nleft at home with this new kind of father. I was sure if I waited long\r\nenough he would come out for me, but it was a chilly evening in October.\r\nI had no wrap, and began to grow very cold.\r\n\r\nI walked away from the house, trying to decide where I should go and\r\nwhat I should do. I could not linger on the streets indefinitely, with\r\nthe possibility of encountering some tipsy factory hand or drummer\r\npassing through. At first there seemed no one to turn to. Finally,\r\nexhausted by stress of emotion, I went to the home of the girl who had\r\nbeen with us at the concert. She had not yet gone to bed, and her mother\r\nwelcomed me so hospitably that I shall be eternally grateful. The next\r\nmorning she lent me carfare to go to Elmira, where I had friends with\r\nwhom I could stay.\r\n\r\nMeantime father had found me gone. He had dressed and tramped up and\r\ndown First Street, searching every byway, inquiring whether I had been\r\nseen. When he had returned at daybreak to find me still missing he had\r\nsent word to Mary, who received his message at almost the same time as\r\none from me, telling her not to worry; I was all right. Both of them\r\nurged me to come back to Corning, and in a few days I did so, taking up\r\nagain my responsibilities. Father and I tried to talk it over, but we\r\ncould not meet on the old ground; between us a deep silence had fallen.\r\n\r\nFather had almost stopped expounding; instead, he was reading more. Debs\r\nhad come on his horizon, and the Socialist papers cropping up all over\r\nthe country were appearing in the house. From the Free Library, which he\r\nhad helped to establish years earlier, he was borrowing Spencer, who was\r\nmodern for that time, and other books on sociology.\r\n\r\nI had given up encouraging young men to see me, but I, too, was\r\npatronizing the library. My books were fiction. “All nonsense,” father\r\nsnorted at the mention of such titles as _Graustark_, _Prisoners of\r\nHope_, or _Three Musketeers_. The word “novel” was still shocking to\r\nmany people, and he classed them all as “love stories.” “Read to\r\ncultivate and uplift your mind. Read what will benefit you in the battle\r\nof life,” he admonished. But I continued my escape from the daily\r\nhumdrum to revel in romances, devouring them in the evenings and hiding\r\nthem under the mattress during the day.\r\n\r\nOne noon when I was waiting for the children to come in to lunch I was\r\nburied in _David Harum_, finding it very funny, and did not hear father\r\nenter. He stood ominously in the doorway. I should have felt trapped,\r\nbut, instead, without warning and without reason, the old love flamed up\r\nagain. I laughed and laughed. I was no longer afraid nor did I care for\r\nhis scowls or his silly old notions. The long silence was broken.\r\n\r\n“Do listen to this.” And I started reading. The frown began to melt away\r\nand soon father too was chuckling. This was the first laughter that had\r\nbeen heard in that dreary household since mother’s death. The book\r\ndisappeared into his room, and soon thereafter he was caught seeking\r\nmore of “that nonsense.”\r\n\r\nAt last I realized why father had been so different. He had been lonely\r\nfor mother, lonely for her love, and doubtless missed her ready\r\nappreciation of his own longings and misgivings. Then, too, he had\r\nalways before depended on her to understand and direct us. He was\r\nprobably a trifle jealous, though not consciously, because he considered\r\njealousy an animal trait far beneath him, and refused to recognize it in\r\nhimself. Nevertheless, beaus had been sidetracking the affections of his\r\nlittle girls. So oppressed had he been by his sense of responsibility\r\nthat he had slipped in judgment and in so doing slid into the small-town\r\nrut of propriety. His belated discipline, caused by worry and anxiety,\r\nwas merely an attempt to guide his children.\r\n\r\nI, however, considered the time had passed for such guidance. I had to\r\nstep forth by myself along the experimental path of adulthood. Though\r\nthe immediate occasion for reading medical books had ceased with\r\nmother’s death, I had never, during these months, lost my deep\r\nconviction that perhaps she might have been saved had I had sufficient\r\nknowledge of medicine. This was linked up with my latent desire to be of\r\nservice in the world. The career of a physician seemed to fulfill all my\r\nrequirements. I could not at the moment see how the gap in education\r\nfrom Claverack to medical school was to be bridged. Nevertheless, I\r\ncould at least make a start with nursing.\r\n\r\nBut father, though he proclaimed his belief in perfect independence of\r\nthought and mind, could not approve nursing as a profession, even when I\r\ntold him that some of the nicest girls were going into it. “Well, they\r\nwon’t be nice long,” he growled. “It’s no sort of work for girls to be\r\ndoing.” My argument that he himself had taught us to help other people\r\nhad no effect.\r\n\r\nFather’s notions, however, were not going to divert me from my\r\nintention; no matter how peaceful the home atmosphere had become, still\r\nI had to get out and try my wings. For six months more we jogged along,\r\nthen, just a year after mother had died, Esther asked me to visit her in\r\nNew York. I really wanted to train in the city, but her mother knew\r\nsomeone on the board of the White Plains Hospital, which was just\r\ninitiating a school. There I was accepted as a probationer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Four_\r\n\r\n                    DARKNESS THERE AND NOTHING MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old White Plains Hospital, not at all like a modern institution, had\r\nbeen a three-storied manor house, long deserted because two people had\r\nonce been found mysteriously dead in it and thereafter nobody would rent\r\nor buy. The hospital board, scoffing at superstition, had gladly\r\npurchased it at the low price to which it had been reduced. However, in\r\nspite of rearrangements and redecorating, many people in White Plains\r\nwent all the way to the Tarrytown Hospital rather than enter the haunted\r\nportals.\r\n\r\nOnce set in spacious grounds the building was still far back from the\r\nroad; a high wall immediately behind it shut off the view of the next\r\nstreet and nothing could be seen beyond except the roof of what had been\r\nthe stable. The surrounding tall trees made it shadowy even in the\r\ndaytime. To reach the office you had to cross a broad pillared veranda.\r\nParlor and sitting room had been thrown together for the male ward, and\r\nan operating room had been tacked on to the rear. The great wide\r\nstairway of fumed oak, lighted at night by low-turned gas jets, swept up\r\nthrough the lofty ceiling. On the second floor were the female ward and\r\na few private rooms. The dozen or so nurses slept in the made-over\r\nservants’ quarters under the gambrel roof.\r\n\r\nStudent nurses in large modern hospitals have little idea what our life\r\nwas like in a small one thirty-five years ago. The single bathroom on\r\neach floor was way at the back. We did not have a resident interne, and,\r\nconsequently, had to depend mainly upon our own judgment. Since we had\r\nno electricity, we could not ring a bell and have our needs supplied,\r\nand had to use our legs for elevators. A probationer had to learn to\r\nmake dressings, bandages, mix solutions, and toil over sterilizing. She\r\nput two inches of water in the wash-boiler, laid a board across the\r\nbricks placed in the bottom, and balanced the laundered linen and gauze\r\non top. Then, clapping on the lid, she set the water to boiling briskly,\r\nwatched the clock, and when the prescribed number of minutes had elapsed\r\nthe sterilizing was over.\r\n\r\nThe great self-confidence with which I entered upon my duties soon\r\nreceived a slight shock. One of our cases was an old man from the County\r\nHome. He complained chiefly of pains in his leg and, since his condition\r\nwas not very serious, the superintendent of nurses left him one\r\nafternoon in my care. This was my first patient. When I heard the\r\nclapper of his little nickeled bell, I hurried with a professional air\r\nto his bedside.\r\n\r\n“Missy, will you please bandage up my sore leg? It does me so much\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nHaving just had my initial lesson in bandaging, I was elated at this\r\nopportunity to try my skill. I set to work with great precision, and,\r\nwhen I had finished, congratulated myself on a neat job, admiring the\r\nsmooth white leg. My first entry went on his record sheet.\r\n\r\nA little later the superintendent, in making her rounds, regarded the\r\nold man perplexedly.\r\n\r\n“Why have you got your leg bandaged?”\r\n\r\n“I asked the nurse to do it for me.”\r\n\r\n“Why that leg? It’s the other one that hurts.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she was so kind I didn’t want to stop her.”\r\n\r\nI bowed my head in embarrassment, but I was young and eager, and it did\r\nnot stay bowed long.\r\n\r\nWithin a short period I considered myself thoroughly inured to what many\r\nlook upon as the unpleasant aspects of nursing; the sight of blood never\r\nmade me squeamish and I had watched operations, even on the brain, with\r\nnone of the usual sick giddiness. Then one day the driver of a Macy\r\ndelivery wagon, who had fallen off the seat, was brought in with a split\r\nnose. I was holding the basin for the young doctor who was stitching it\r\nup, when one of the other nurses said something to tease him. He dropped\r\nhis work, leaving the needle and cat-gut thread sticking across the\r\npatient’s nose, and chased her out of the room and down the hall. The\r\npatient, painless under a local anesthetic, gazed mildly after them; but\r\nthe idea that doctor and nurse could be so callous as to play jokes\r\nhorrified me.\r\n\r\nWhen pursuer and pursued returned they found me in a heap on the floor,\r\nthe basin tipped over beside me, instruments and sponges scattered\r\neverywhere. The patient was still sitting quietly waiting for all the\r\nfoolishness to stop. I am glad to say this was the one and only time I\r\never fainted on duty.\r\n\r\nThe training, rigid though it was, would have been far less difficult\r\nhad it not been for the truly diabolical head nurse. In the morning she\r\nwas all smiles, so saintly that you could almost glimpse the halo around\r\nher head. But as the day wore on the demon in her appeared. She could\r\nalways think up extra things for you to do to keep you from your regular\r\nafternoon two hours off. This was particularly hard on me because I had\r\ndeveloped tubercular glands and was running a temperature. In my second\r\nyear I was operated on, and two weeks later assigned to night duty,\r\nwhere I stayed for three awful months.\r\n\r\nMy worst tribulation came during this period. People then seldom went to\r\nhospitals with minor ailments; our patients were commonly the very sick,\r\nrequiring a maximum of attention. There was no orderly and I could use\r\nonly my left hand because my right shoulder was still bandaged. I took\r\ncare of admissions, entered case histories, and, when sharp bells\r\npunctuated the waiting stillness, sometimes one coming before I had time\r\nto answer the first, I pattered hurriedly up and down the three flights,\r\nthrough the shadows relieved only by the faint red glow from the gas\r\njets. I suppose adventures were inevitable.\r\n\r\nOne night an Italian was picked up on the street in a state of almost\r\ncomplete exhaustion, and brought to the hospital. He was so ill with\r\nsuspected typhoid that he should have had a “special,” but instead he\r\nwas placed in the ward. An old leather couch stood across the windows,\r\nand whenever a pause came in my duties I lay down. From there I could\r\nkeep an eye on my new patient. Sick as he was he insisted on making the\r\nlong trip through the ward to the bathroom. I could not explain how\r\nunwise this was, because he could not understand a word of English. He\r\nmust have reeled out of his bed between thirty and forty times.\r\n\r\nJust as the early spring dawn came creeping in the window behind me I\r\ngrew drowsy. I was on the point of dozing off when some premonition\r\nwarned me and I opened my eyelids enough to see the man reach under his\r\npillow, take something out cautiously, glide from his bed. Spellbound I\r\nwatched him slithering soft-footedly as he edged his way towards me. I\r\nseemed to be hypnotized with sleep and could not stir. He came nearer\r\nand nearer with eyes fixed, hands behind him. Suddenly I snapped into\r\nduty, arose quickly, ordered him back to bed, and ran ahead to\r\nstraighten his sheets and pillows, not realizing my danger until he\r\nloomed over me, his knife in his hand. Before he could thrust I grabbed\r\nhis arm and held it. Though I was small-boned I had good muscles, and he\r\nwas very ill.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, another patient snatched up his bell and rang, and rang and\r\nrang. Nobody answered. The nurses were too far away to hear; the other\r\npatients in the ward were unable to help me. But the man quickly used up\r\nwhat little energy he had, and I was able to get the knife from him,\r\npush him back in bed, and take his temperature. I assumed he had\r\nsuddenly become delirious.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o’clock I answered a summons to the front door and found\r\nthree policemen who wanted to know whether we had an Italian patient.\r\n“Indeed we have,” I answered feelingly and called the superintendent.\r\n\r\nWhen the red tape was unwound, I learned that my Italian belonged to a\r\ngang which had been hiding in a cave between Tarrytown and White Plains,\r\nholding up passers-by. Amongst them they had committed five murders. The\r\nothers had all been hunted down, but this man’s collapse had temporarily\r\ncovered his whereabouts. The attack on me had apparently been merely\r\nincidental to his attempt at escape through the open window behind me.\r\nHe was carried off to the County Hospital Jail, and I was not sorry to\r\nsee him go.\r\n\r\nAfter this incident an orderly was employed and, though he was allowed\r\nto sleep at night, it was reassuring to know he could be called in an\r\nemergency. The emergency soon arose. A young man of about twenty-five,\r\nof well-to-do parents, was admitted as an alcoholic. I remember that I\r\nwas impressed by the softness of his handshake when I greeted him. He\r\nhad the first symptoms of delirium tremens but he was now perfectly\r\nconscious and needed no more than routine attention.\r\n\r\nSometime in the night the new arrival asked me to get him a drink of\r\nwater. When I came back into the room and offered it to him he knocked\r\nme into the corner ten feet away. As my head banged against the wall, he\r\nleaped out of bed after me and reached down for my throat. Though\r\nhalf-stunned and off my feet, I yet had more strength than the man whose\r\nflabby muscles refused to obey his will. The patient in the adjoining\r\nbed rang and in a few moments the orderly came to my assistance. Between\r\nus we got the poor crazed youth into a strait jacket. The doctor who was\r\nsummoned could do nothing and in the morning the young man mercifully\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nTo differentiate between things real and things imaginary was not always\r\neasy at nighttime. One morning about two o’clock I was writing my case\r\nhistories in the reception office on the ground floor just off the\r\nveranda. Both window and curtain behind my back were up about ten inches\r\nto let in the cool, moist air. Abruptly I had a feeling that eyes were\r\nstaring at me. I could not have explained why; I had heard no sound, but\r\nI was certain some human being was somewhere about. Anybody who had come\r\non legitimate business would have spoken. Perhaps it was another patient\r\nwith a knife. Should I sit still? Should I look behind me?\r\n\r\nI turned my head to the window, and there an ugly, grinning face with a\r\nspreading, black mustache was peering in at me. It might have been\r\ndisembodied; all I could see was this extraordinary face, white against\r\nthe inky background. It was not a patient, not anyone in my charge.\r\nRelief was immediate and action automatic. I seized the long window\r\npole, twice as tall as I, dashed to the outer door, and shooed him off\r\nthe veranda. He ran for the outer gate while I brandished my weapon\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nSuch instantaneous responses must have been the result of having in\r\nchildhood sent fears about their business before they could gather\r\nmomentum. Now I could usually act without having to think very much\r\nabout them or be troubled in retrospect. They were all in the day’s work\r\nof the night nurse.\r\n\r\nProbably the fact that I was low in vitality made me more susceptible to\r\nmental than physical influences. Realistic doctors and stern head nurses\r\ntried to keep tales of the old house from the probationers, but not very\r\nsuccessfully. When the colored patients could not sleep they used to\r\ntell us weird stories, and with rolling eyes solemnly affirmed they were\r\ntrue. One old darky woman, hearing the hoot owls begin their mournful\r\n“too-whoo, too-whoo,” would sit straight up in her bed and whisper,\r\n“Suppose dat callin’ me? Hit’s callin’ someone in dis hospital.”\r\n\r\nAgain and again after the owls’ hooting either somebody in the hospital\r\ndied, or was brought in to die from an accident. Reason told me this was\r\npure coincidence, but it began to get on my nerves.\r\n\r\nAnd then stranger events, for which I could find no explanation,\r\nfollowed. Once when I was making my rounds a little after midnight, I\r\nturned into the room occupied by the tubercular valet of a member of the\r\nIselin family. I had expected him to be sleeping quietly because he was\r\nmerely there to rest up before being sent back home to England, but he\r\nwas awake and asked for ice. I started for the refrigerator, which was\r\ntwo flights down in the cellar. But at the top of the stairs I suddenly\r\nstopped short—“One—Two—Three!” I heard dull, distinct knocks directly\r\nunder the stairway.\r\n\r\nNot one, single, tangible thing near by could have made those sounds. In\r\nthe space of a few seconds I took an inventory of the importance of my\r\nlife as compared to the proper care of my patient. I had to walk\r\ndeliberately down those steps, not knowing what might be lying in wait\r\nfor me below. As I stepped on the first tread the same knocks came\r\nagain—“One—Two—Three!”\r\n\r\nI tried to hurry but it seemed to me that each foot had tons of iron\r\nattached to it. The little red devils of night lights blinked at me and\r\nseemed to make the shadows thicker in the corners. But nothing clutched\r\nme from the dim and ghostly hall. I got down those steps somehow and\r\npassed through the dining room into the kitchen. There I paused again.\r\nShould I take a butcher knife with me? “No, I won’t do that,” I answered\r\nmyself resolutely, and started for the cellar stairs.\r\n\r\nFor the third time came the knocking. Glancing to right and left, my\r\nback against the dark, I crept down, reached the refrigerator, broke off\r\nsome chunks of ice with trembling hands, put them in a bowl, steeled\r\nmyself while I chopped them into still finer pieces, and set out on the\r\nreturn, my feet much lighter going up than down.\r\n\r\nI had been away only a brief while altogether, but the patient, for no\r\napparent cause, had had a hemorrhage, and died in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nMany times after that I heard these nocturnal sounds, usually overhead.\r\nThey began to seem more like footsteps—“tap, tap, tap, tap,”—very quick\r\nand a bit muffled. Soon I was not sleeping well in the daytime.\r\n\r\nOne morning I asked at breakfast table, “Who was walking around last\r\nnight?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t.” “Not I.” “Certainly not me,” came a chorus. “What makes you\r\nthink someone was up?”\r\n\r\n“I distinctly heard footsteps the full length of the third floor.”\r\n\r\n“What time?”\r\n\r\n“Around four o’clock.”\r\n\r\nBut nobody admitted to having been up. “Then one of you must have been\r\nwalking in your sleep,” I insisted.\r\n\r\nThe nurse who had preceded me on night duty timidly contributed, “I\r\nalways heard somebody. I didn’t want to say anything about it for fear\r\nyou’d think I was queer.”\r\n\r\nTowards morning of the very next night when I was in the second floor\r\nward, I heard the patter again above my head. I ran upstairs to the\r\nnurses’ quarters as fast as I could and looked down the corridor. Every\r\ndoor was tight shut. I tore down two flights to the first floor. The\r\nnoise came once more above me. Back to the second floor. All patients\r\nwere in their beds. I asked the only wakeful one, “Did you get up just\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Did anybody else get up?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nSome nights went by quietly. But I heard the noises often enough to\r\nbecome truly concerned for fear I might be imagining things. I said to\r\none of the older nurses, “I’m going to wake you up and see whether you\r\nhear them too.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll sit up with you,” she offered.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll call you. They never come until almost morning.”\r\n\r\nThe next time, at the first tap, I hurried to her room, shook her awake,\r\nled her to the floor below, “There, do you hear it?”\r\n\r\nHer expression was confirmation enough.\r\n\r\nLeaving her I raced down another flight, and waited. In a moment the\r\n“Tap, tap, tap, tap” came again from overhead. Up I went. She said she\r\nhad heard it all right but it had come from over _her_ head. At least my\r\nsenses were not playing me tricks. My accounts were given greater\r\ncredence, and other nurses sometimes interrupted their slumbers to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nOne of my companions told a young and intelligent doctor on the staff\r\nthat I had better be taken off night duty before I had a nervous\r\nbreakdown. Though he thought this was girlish nonsense, he could see I\r\nwas being seriously affected, and anyhow the strain of three continuous\r\nmonths at such a hard task was far too much. Another nurse relieved me.\r\n\r\nAfter my second glandular operation I was placed in one of the private\r\nrooms on the upper floor. I had not come through very well, and this\r\nsame doctor remained in the hospital all night to be on call. Being\r\nrestless, I woke up, only to hear the identical noises which had haunted\r\nme for so long. I called him and exclaimed, “There it is. Don’t you hear\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nHe did, but confidently he strode upstairs to the nurses’ floor. I knew\r\nhe would find nothing. When he came back, I asked, “Did you see anyone?”\r\n\r\n“No. Apparently everybody was asleep. I looked in all the rooms.”\r\n\r\nImmediately the raps came again. He moved a little faster to get\r\ndownstairs. In a few minutes he put his head back in the door. “You’re\r\nin bed? You haven’t been up?” I assured him I had not moved, knowing\r\nwell he must have heard them as always I had, from above.\r\n\r\nThough still believing somebody was walking around the place, the doctor\r\nby this time was determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, and\r\nreturned every night for a week. But the sound was a will-o’-the-wisp.\r\nHe never could catch up with it. He was so eager to exhaust every\r\npossibility that he even brought the matter before the board. One of\r\nthem patronizingly explained that it was probably the echo from some rat\r\nin the walls; they were in the habit of dismissing thus lightly the\r\nsuperstitions which clung about the old house.\r\n\r\nThe doctor continued his detective work until one day he appeared in\r\ngreat good humor. From the rear windows he pointed to the roof which\r\nrose beyond the high back wall. “I’ve found it. That stable is built on\r\nthe same timbers as this house. When some horse grows restless towards\r\nmorning he stamps and the vibration is carried through them underground\r\nto this building. Now do you believe in ghosts?”\r\n\r\nLife was by no means so serious as all this sounds. Amelia had followed\r\nme into the hospital and we continued our gay times together. For that\r\nmatter nursing itself often presented amusing aspects. The supply of\r\nregistered nurses was very small, and in our last year of training we\r\nwere sent out on private cases, thus seeing both the highlights and\r\nlowlights of life, which prepared us well in experience.\r\n\r\nOne which had romantic overtones took place immediately after Howard\r\nWillett had transferred his house-party from Aiken, South Carolina, to\r\nGedney Farms Manor in White Plains. The indisposition of young Eugene\r\nSugney Reynal was pronounced scarlet fever. The contagion began\r\nspreading among the guests and servants, and Dr. Julius Schmid, old and\r\nhonored, a noteworthy figure in the community and also our chief of\r\nstaff, detailed three of us nurses for service there, practically\r\nturning the place into a hospital for five weeks.\r\n\r\nMy special charge was Adelaide Fitzgerald, Reynal’s fiancée, but as\r\nnecessity arose we shifted around. Reynal’s condition grew steadily\r\nworse. One morning at daybreak when the patient was almost in a coma Dr.\r\nSchmid sent for the priest to administer extreme unction, and said to\r\nme, “You’d better get Miss Fitzgerald and tell her there’s very little\r\nhope.”\r\n\r\nShe knelt by his bed, “Gene,” she called to him, “Gene, we’re going to\r\nbe married—right now.”\r\n\r\nReynal was as near death as a man could be, but her voice reached into\r\nhis subconscious and summoned him back. Another nurse and I, hastily\r\ncalled upon to act as bridesmaids, stood in starched and rustling white\r\nbeside the bed. It was extraordinary to watch; Reynal seemed to shake\r\nhimself alive until he was conscious enough to respond “I do” to the\r\npriest who had arrived to perform quite a different office.\r\n\r\nAs an anti-climax to all the excitement, and to my intense disgust, I\r\nmyself came down with a mild attack of scarlet fever. I was so\r\nembarrassed that I went right on working and did not take to my bed\r\nuntil I actually began to peel.\r\n\r\nMy usual cases offered drama of another sort. Often I was called in the\r\nmiddle of the night on a maternity case, perhaps ten miles away from the\r\nhospital, where I had to sterilize the water and boil the forceps over a\r\nwood fire in the kitchen stove while the doctor scrubbed up as best he\r\ncould. Many times labor terminated before he could arrive and I had to\r\nperform the delivery by myself.\r\n\r\nTo see a baby born is one of the greatest experiences that a human being\r\ncan have. Birth to me has always been more awe-inspiring than death. As\r\noften as I have witnessed the miracle, held the perfect creature with\r\nits tiny hands and tiny feet, each time I have felt as though I were\r\nentering a cathedral with prayer in my heart.\r\n\r\nThere is so little knowledge in the world compared with what there is to\r\nknow. Always I was deeply affected by the trust patients, rich or poor,\r\nmale or female, old or young, placed in their nurses. When we appeared\r\nthey seemed to say, “Ah, here is someone who can tell us.” Mothers asked\r\nme pathetically, plaintively, hopefully, “Miss Higgins, what should I do\r\nnot to have another baby right away?” I was at a loss to answer their\r\nintimate questions, and passed them along to the doctor, who more often\r\nthan not snorted, “She ought to be ashamed of herself to talk to a young\r\ngirl about things like that.”\r\n\r\nAll such problems were thus summarily shoved aside. We had one woman in\r\nour hospital who had had several miscarriages and six babies, each by a\r\ndifferent father. Doctors and nurses knew every time she went out that\r\nshe would soon be back again, but it was not their business or anybody’s\r\nbusiness; it was just “natural.”\r\n\r\nTo be polished off neatly, the nurses in training were assigned to one\r\nof the larger city hospitals in which to work during the last three or\r\nsix months of our course. Mine was the Manhattan Eye and Ear at\r\nForty-first Street and Park Avenue, across the street from the Murray\r\nHill Hotel, and I welcomed the chance to see up-to-date equipment and\r\nclockwork discipline. My new environment was considerably less harsh and\r\nintense, more comfortable and leisurely.\r\n\r\nAt one of the frequent informal dances held there my doctor partner\r\nreceived a message—not a call, but a caller. His architect wanted to go\r\nover blueprints with him. “Come along,” he invited. “See whether you\r\nthink my new house is going to be as fine as I do.”\r\n\r\nThe architect was introduced. “This is William Sanger.”\r\n\r\nThe three of us bent over the plans. The doctor was the only one unaware\r\nof the sudden electric quality of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAt seven-thirty the next morning when I went out for my usual\r\n“constitutional,” Bill Sanger was on the doorstep. He had that type of\r\nromantic nature which appealed to me, and had been waiting there all\r\nnight. We took our walk together that day and regularly for many days\r\nthereafter, learning about each other, exploring each other’s minds, and\r\ndiscovering a community of ideas and ideals. His fineness fitted in with\r\nmy whole destiny, if I can call it such, just as definitely as my\r\nhospital training.\r\n\r\nI found Bill’s mother a lovely person—artistic, musical, and highly\r\ncultured. His father had been a wealthy sheep rancher in Australia. When\r\nyou travel anywhere from there, you practically have to go round the\r\nworld, and on his way to San Francisco he had passed through Central\r\nEurope. In a German town he had fallen in love with the Mayor’s youngest\r\ndaughter, then only fourteen. When she was of marriageable age he had\r\nreturned for her, and it was from this talented mother that Bill had\r\nderived his fondness for music and desire to paint.\r\n\r\nBill was an architect only by profession; he was pure artist by\r\ntemperament. Although his heart was not in mechanical drawing, he did it\r\nwell. Stanford White once told me he was one of the six best draftsmen\r\nin New York. He confided to me his dream of eventually being able to\r\nleave architecture behind and devote himself to painting, particularly\r\nmurals. I had had instilled in me a feeling for the natural relationship\r\nbetween color and symmetry of line, and sympathized not merely with his\r\naspirations but was intensely proud of his work. Some day we were going\r\nto be married, and as soon as we had saved enough we would go to Paris,\r\nwhither the inspiration of the great French painters was summoning\r\nartists from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThese plans were nebulous and had nothing to do with my abrupt departure\r\nfrom New York. One afternoon, about four o’clock, I was standing under a\r\nskylight putting drops in the eyes of a convalescent patient.\r\nUnexpectedly, inexplicably, the glass began to fall apart. Almost by\r\ninstinct I pulled my patient under the lintel of the door. A great blast\r\nfollowed and pandemonium was let loose; the ruined skylight went\r\ncrashing down the stairs, plaster and radiators tumbled from the walls,\r\ndoors fell out, windows cracked.\r\n\r\nI rushed to the bed of the man who needed my first attention. He had\r\nbeen operated on for a cataract only a few hours previously and my\r\norders had been not to let him move too soon lest the fluid in his eye\r\nrun out and damage his sight permanently. But he with the other\r\nterrified patients was already on his feet.\r\n\r\nRounding up all those under my care and checking their names took\r\nseveral minutes, and while I was still trying to quiet them, ambulances\r\nfrom other hospitals came clanging up. By the time I had ushered my\r\ncharges down to the ground floor, a way had been cleared through the\r\ndebris of fallen brick and wood. Since mine were not stretcher cases I\r\nwas able to crowd ten of them into one ambulance, and we were taken to\r\nthe New York Hospital. Not until I had them all safely installed did I\r\nlearn what had happened to our building. A tremendous explosion in the\r\nnew Park Avenue subway had practically demolished it, and it had to be\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\nI returned to White Plains, where Bill came up frequently to see me. On\r\none of our rambles he idly pulled at some vines on a stone wall, and\r\nthen, with his hands, tilted my face for a kiss. The next morning, to my\r\nmortification, four telltale finger marks were outlined on my cheek by\r\npoison ivy blisters. The day after that, my face was swollen so that my\r\neyes were tight shut, and I was sick for two months; since my training\r\nwas finished, I was sent home to convalesce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Five_\r\n\r\n                        CORALS TO CUT LIFE UPON\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a while I stayed at Corning, and then went back to New York to start\r\nnursing in earnest. On one of my free afternoons in August, Bill and I\r\nwent for a drive, and he suggested we stop in at the house of a friend\r\nof his who was a minister. All had been prepared. License and rice were\r\nwaiting. And so we were married.\r\n\r\nThe first year is half taken up with love and half with planning a\r\nfuture together which is to endure forever. These dreams feed youthful\r\nambitions, but they seldom can come true in their entirety. In our case\r\nthe obstacles arose with undue speed.\r\n\r\nI was not well. I was paying the cost of long hours in mother’s closely\r\nconfined room and of continuous overwork in the hospital. Medical advice\r\nwas to go West to live, but I would not go without Bill, and he had a\r\ncommission which kept him in New York. Accordingly, I was packed off to\r\na small semi-sanitarium near Saranac where the great Dr. Trudeau,\r\nspecialist in pulmonary tuberculosis, was consulted.\r\n\r\nExistence there was depressing. A man might be talking to me one day,\r\nfull of life and spirit and hope, and the next morning not appear. The\r\ndead were ordinarily removed in the quiet of the night, and the doctors\r\nmade no comment. In this gloomy environment I rested, preparing myself\r\nfor motherhood. The flood of treatises on child psychology had not yet\r\nstarted, and even the books on the care and feeding of infants were few.\r\nBut I read whatever I could.\r\n\r\nJust before it was time for the baby to be born I returned to the little\r\napartment on St. Nicholas Avenue at 149th Street, then practically\r\nsuburban. Taking every precaution, we had engaged four doctors in a row.\r\nDr. Schmid had said he would perform the ceremony unless it came at\r\nnight, in which case his assistant would have to take charge. The\r\nassistant had provided that, if he were not available, his assistant\r\nwould be on call, and this assistant had another assistant to assist\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen towards three o’clock one morning I felt the first thin, fine pains\r\nof warning, Bill tried one after the other of our obstetricians—not one\r\ncould be located. He had to run around the corner to the nearest general\r\npractitioner. Due almost as much to this young doctor’s inexperience as\r\nto my physical state, the ordeal was unusually hard, but the baby\r\nStuart, given Amelia’s family name, was perfectly healthy, strong, and\r\nsturdy. I looked upon this as a victory, although it was only partial,\r\nbecause I had to go right back to the mountains. It was a wrench to\r\nleave again so soon and at such a time, but I could not believe it would\r\nbe for long.\r\n\r\nWith Stuart and a nurse I took rooms in a friendly farmhouse near a\r\nsmall Adirondack village; I did not want the baby in the midst of sick\r\npeople, and, moreover, I was not welcome at Saranac itself, since Dr.\r\nTrudeau did not like to have in residence patients whose illness had\r\nprogressed beyond a certain stage. One of the most important parts of\r\nthe treatment was stuffing with food. I was being filled with the then\r\nrecognized remedy, creosote, and gulped capsule after capsule, which\r\nbroke my appetite utterly. Still I had to pour down milk and swallow\r\neggs, and always I had to rest and rest and rest.\r\n\r\nAt the end of eight months I was worse instead of better, and had no\r\ninterest in living. Nan and Bill’s mother were summoned, and two of Dr.\r\nTrudeau’s associates came to see me. They advised that I should go\r\nnearer Saranac and be separated from all personal responsibilities.\r\n\r\n“What would you yourself like to do?” they asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Where would you like to go?”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to have the baby sent to your brother, or would you\r\nrather have your mother-in-law take it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care.”\r\n\r\nTo every suggestion I was negative. I was not even interested in my\r\nbaby.\r\n\r\nThe two doctors left. The younger, however, apparently not satisfied\r\nwith the professional attitude, returned almost immediately, not so much\r\nin a medical capacity as one of anxious friendliness. I was still\r\nsitting in the same state of listlessness. He laid his hand on my\r\nshoulder quietly, but I had all the feeling of being violently shaken.\r\n“Don’t be like this!” he exclaimed. “Don’t let yourself get into such a\r\nmental condition. Do something! Want something! You’ll never get well if\r\nyou keep on this way.”\r\n\r\nI could not sleep that night. I had been rudely jolted from my stupor by\r\nthe understanding doctor. Obviously preparations were being made for a\r\nlingering illness which would terminate in death. But if I had to die I\r\nwould rather be with those I loved than disappear in the night as a part\r\nof the cold routine.\r\n\r\nAs the first glimmer of dawn appeared through the curtains I got up and\r\nstared at the steadily ticking clock. It was not yet five. I dressed\r\nquickly, then tiptoed into the bedroom where the nurse and baby were\r\nslumbering soundly. I roused her and told her to pack up; we were going\r\nback to New York. She looked up in drowsy dismay, but obeyed meekly. The\r\nfarmer hitched up his horse and we jogged along all the way to the\r\nstation in the early summer morning, bright with sunshine and cheery\r\nwith birds.\r\n\r\nBill was waiting at the Grand Central Terminal, quite naturally\r\nperplexed. He had that morning received two telegrams, one saying I was\r\nto be removed to Saranac at once, pending his approval as to the care of\r\nthe baby by relatives, and the other from me asking him to meet me\r\nbecause I was coming home. I told him as best I could the reasons for my\r\nsudden decision. Though I probably sounded incoherent he understood and,\r\ninstead of scolding, soothed me tenderly and exclaimed, “You did just\r\nthe right thing. I won’t let you die.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t make me eat! Don’t even mention food to me!” He promised to\r\nlet me have my own way.\r\n\r\nAt the small family hotel in Yonkers in which we settled, I lived pretty\r\nmuch by myself, keeping the baby and everyone else away from me; I had\r\nby now learned the dangers of contact in spreading tuberculosis. Once\r\nfree from the horrors of invalidism and comforted by love and devotion I\r\nbegan to regain a normal interest in life, and by the end of three weeks\r\nhad recovered from my hysterical rejection of food.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was strong enough we started to explore Westchester County\r\nfor a home site. We wanted something more than a mere house. We wanted\r\nspace, we wanted a view, we wanted a garden. At Hastings-on-Hudson we\r\nfound what we sought. There on fifty acres of hillside overlooking the\r\nriver about ten families—doctors, teachers, college professors,\r\nscientists—had combined to construct the sort of dwellings they liked in\r\nthe environment they considered best suited for their children. We too\r\nhad in mind a family and a comfortable, serene, suburban existence, and\r\nwe joined this Columbia Colony, as it was called, renting a small\r\ncottage until we could build our own.\r\n\r\nThe other wives and I spent our afternoons conferring over the momentous\r\nproblems of servants, gardens, and schools. If we went to town, we took\r\nthe children with us, fitting them with special shoes at Coward’s,\r\nintroducing them to museums, libraries, or art galleries. Life centered\r\naround them. When Stuart and his little friends began to ask questions,\r\n“Where do babies come from?” I collected them and tried to answer, using\r\nthe simple phenomena of nature as illustrations—flowers, frogs, fish,\r\nand animals. I still consider this approach has its place with many\r\nchildren, although modern sex educationists may smile at this method,\r\nthinking it old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nNone of the colony played cards. Instead, the women formed a literary\r\nclub where we read papers on George Eliot, Browning, and Shakespeare, as\r\nwell as on some current authors, and we had occasional political\r\ndiscussions. Out of this grew the Women’s Club of Hastings.\r\n\r\nIt was all very pleasant, and at first I was busy and contented. The\r\nendless details of housekeeping did not seem to me drudgery; conquering\r\nminor crises was exciting. Though I was never slavishly domestic, I was\r\ninclined to be slavishly maternal. Bill was a devoted husband. He took\r\ncare of me in the little ways—starting for the train and coming back to\r\nput his head in the door and call, “It’s awfully cold. Don’t go out\r\nwithout your wrap,” or, if it were hot, he offered, “Give me your list\r\nand I’ll send up the groceries.”\r\n\r\nI was again leading the life of an artist’s family. Bill was a hard\r\nworker; I can rarely remember one evening of just reading together. I\r\ndid the reading and he drew or painted. But I was never quite sure\r\nwhether we were rich or poor. He possessed the finest qualities of\r\ncreative genius, and with them some of its limitations and liabilities.\r\nWhen he was paid for a big commission he brought me orchids and\r\nembroidered Japanese robes which I had no occasion to wear, and filled\r\nthe house with luxuries. This did not go with my practical sense. If the\r\ngrocery account were long unpaid, I protested, “They’re beautiful. Thank\r\nyou, but can we afford them?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” and out of his pocket came tickets for the opera or\r\ntheater, his chief pleasures.\r\n\r\n“But we shouldn’t,” I remonstrated as I ruffled a sheaf of bills before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we used the tickets.\r\n\r\nEvery architect wants to embody his ideas at least once in his own home.\r\nOurs was “modern” in its square simplicity and unadorned surfaces of\r\nstuccoed hollow tile, even being called a show house; people came from\r\nafar to study it. It was designed to have a large nursery opening on a\r\nveranda overlooking the Hudson, a studio, a bath with each bedroom,\r\nfireplaces everywhere, and one especially capacious in the big library.\r\nFrom this room the open stairway, forking at the lower landing with a\r\nfew steps leading down into the kitchen, reached up the wall to the\r\nsecond story.\r\n\r\nThe house took long to complete, but it was fun. The moment Bill\r\nfinished his work in New York he was back at it. Theoretically he\r\nsupervised at night and the builder built by day. But when an arch did\r\nnot turn out to be a perfect arch, seizing an ax, he chopped out part of\r\nit, usually pounding his fingers in the process. The neighbors, careful\r\nof their pennies, held their ears at the clatter and clamor and\r\nexclaimed, “There goes another partition.” When the contractor returned\r\nin the morning he found his previous day’s work demolished. Some\r\nportions were entirely done over two or three times.\r\n\r\nThe color on the woodwork we applied ourselves by artificial light,\r\nplumped on our knees or stretching high overhead. If the effect were\r\nwrong, we had to match it all up again. Evening after evening we labored\r\non the rose window which was to crown with radiance the head of the\r\nstaircase. Far into the night we leaded and welded together every\r\nglowing petal. Our fingers were cut, our nerves were irritated, our eyes\r\nfatigued. But tireless love went into the composition of this rose\r\nwindow which symbolized the stability of our future. We were aiming at\r\npermanence and security, and our efforts seemed to be fused into\r\nindestructible unity. It was our keystone of beauty.\r\n\r\nAfter the tedious worrying over details we suddenly became too impatient\r\nto wait any more, and, in spite of the raw condition of the house, late\r\none February afternoon of half-sleet, half-rain, a moving van pulled up\r\nto our front door. Through the semi-twilight boxes, crates, and barrels\r\nwere carted in.\r\n\r\nThe four-year-old Stuart was not well. We put him early to bed, and Bill\r\nstirred up a roaring fire in the furnace against the increasing cold.\r\nThen with hammer and claw we turned to our treasures, which we had not\r\nseen for such a time. It was like opening packages on Christmas morning.\r\nWe had almost forgotten the tapestry Mary had sent from Persia, the rug\r\nfrom Egypt, Bill’s paintings. “What’s in this box? Oh, look here! See\r\nwhat I’ve found!” A flood of color inundated us. We tried out their\r\nwarmth against our immaculate walls and floors. I was carrying my second\r\nbaby and was tired hours before I wanted to stop. As I climbed up to bed\r\nI gazed down happily on the litter below.\r\n\r\nSome time later I heard dimly through my sleep a pounding, and woke to\r\nrealize it was the German maid at the door, crying, “Madam. Come! Fire\r\nin the big stove!”\r\n\r\nWe jumped out of bed. Acrid smoke was in our nostrils, and we were swept\r\nby the horror of fire by night. Bill shouted to me, “Get right out! I’ve\r\ngot to give the alarm.”\r\n\r\nAway he rushed in his pajamas; there was no telephone within half a\r\nmile. I seized Stuart from his crib, bedclothes and all. This took only\r\na few seconds, but the kitchen was already ablaze and flames were\r\nleaping up the staircase. I pulled the blanket over his head and started\r\ncautiously down, hugging the outer side. The blistering treads crunched\r\nas they gave under my feet, but did not collapse until I had reached the\r\nsmoke-filled library.\r\n\r\nThe family across the street welcomed us in. When I had tucked Stuart\r\ninto an impromptu bed I went to watch. Not merely was the fire engine\r\ntrying to get up the icy hill, two steps forward and one back, but the\r\nwhole village was accompanying it to help organize a bucket brigade.\r\n\r\nThe clouds had cleared and the bright moon was shining on the strange\r\nscene. The weather had turned much colder, and the rain had frozen into\r\ncrystals which glittered on the branches of trees and shrubbery. It was\r\nunbelievably fantastic, and in that unreal setting the flames, as though\r\ndirected by devilish intent, spurted only through our prized rose\r\nwindow. I stood silently regarding the result of months of work and love\r\nslowly disintegrate. Petal by petal it succumbed to the licking tongues\r\nof fire; one by one they fell into the gray-white snow. Fitting them\r\ntogether had taken so long; now relentlessly they were being pulled\r\napart. A thing of beauty had perished in a few moments.\r\n\r\nIt was as though a chapter of my life had been brought to a close, and I\r\nwas neither disappointed nor regretful. On the contrary, I was conscious\r\nof a certain relief, of a burden lifted. In that instant I learned the\r\nlesson of the futility of material substances. Of what great importance\r\nwere they spiritually if they could go so quickly? Pains, thirsts,\r\nheartaches could be put into the creation of something external which in\r\none sweep could be taken from you. With the destruction of the window,\r\nmy scale of suburban values was consumed. I could never again pin my\r\nfaith on concrete things; I must build on myself alone. I hoped I should\r\ncontinue to have lovely objects around me, but I could also be happy\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nThe next day was filled with neighbors coming to condole and offer help,\r\nand with insurance adjusters peering about and questioning. They found\r\nthe too-heavy fire in the furnace had overheated the pipes around which\r\nthe asbestos had not yet been wrapped. We lost a good deal because,\r\nalthough the house was covered, the insurance on the furniture had not\r\nbeen shifted to its new location, and, moreover, many of our possessions\r\nwere irreplaceable, their worth having lain in the sentiment attached to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA personal catastrophe may in the end prove to be a public benefit.\r\nPeople in the community are brought together in sympathy, and learn by\r\nthe experience of others how to protect themselves. After our mischance\r\nevery householder in Columbia Colony began to look to his furnace and\r\ninsure his home.\r\n\r\nOur walls were fireproof, and much of the house could be saved, but it\r\nwas really more disheartening than complete demolition would have been,\r\nfor in the latter case we could have started to rebuild from the\r\nbeginning. I admired Bill greatly for the resolute way he set about the\r\npainful business again. He went over every inch, here saying, “This\r\nboard is all right,” and there tearing out black pieces of charred wood.\r\nIt was a dirty job, but he stuck to it. Nevertheless, paint and stain as\r\nwe would, we could not quite get rid of the unmistakable and\r\nineradicable odor which clings around a burned building, almost like the\r\nsmell of death.\r\n\r\nNext summer we moved in once more. But the house was never the same.\r\nNever could I recapture that first flush of joy.\r\n\r\nGrant, my second son, was born almost immediately. I loved having a baby\r\nto tend again, and wanted at least four more as quickly as my health\r\nwould permit. I could not wait another five years. I yearned especially\r\nfor a daughter, and twenty months later my wish came true. After Peggy’s\r\nbirth, the doctor went downstairs and saw Bill sitting in the library\r\nwith Grant in his arms and tears welling from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter? There’s a nice little girl upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“I’m thinking of this poor little boy. Margaret has wanted a girl so\r\nlong—now she’ll have no room in her heart for him.”\r\n\r\nBill’s fears were groundless. Grant was not supplanted, but Peggy was so\r\nsatisfactory a baby that I was not particularly disappointed when my\r\nillness cropped up again and the doctor said my family must end at this\r\npoint. I was quite content with things as they were.\r\n\r\nEven as a little fellow, the sandy-haired, square-built Stuart was\r\npractical, loved sports, and had a reasoning, logical mind, always\r\nexperimenting with life as well as with mechanical things. A thorough\r\nHiggins, he had to find out for himself and prove it. He used to stamp\r\nand scold when presented with a chore, such as mowing the lawn or\r\nbringing in wood for the fireplaces, but his rebellions were brief, and,\r\nwhen he realized the inevitable, he turned it into a game. “Come on\r\nover,” he hailed his friends. “We’ve lots to do. Let’s get to it! We’re\r\ngoing to have great fun.”\r\n\r\nThe other boys, taken in by his enthusiastic invitations, also believed\r\nthat mowing the lawn or bringing in wood were among the best games\r\ninvented.\r\n\r\nGrant was more self-conscious than Stuart, and more inarticulate, but\r\nmore affectionate. He followed the baby Peggy slavishly. They were\r\nusually hand in hand, and Grant’s darkness contrasted with her bright,\r\nblond hair. From the time she could talk they referred to themselves as\r\n“we.” Peggy was the most independent child I have ever seen. At three\r\nshe knew what she wanted and where she was going. She was vivacious,\r\nmischievous, laughing—the embodiment of all my hopes in a daughter.\r\n\r\nStuart typified the scientist, Grant the artist, Peggy the doer. It was\r\nmaternally gratifying to wonder whether they would carry out these\r\npropensities in their later lives.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed my literary activities along with my children, and Bill\r\nencouraged me. “You go ahead and finish your writing. I’ll get the\r\ndinner and wash the dishes.” And what is more he did it, drawing the\r\nshades, however, so that nobody could see him. He thought I should make\r\na career of it instead of limiting myself to small-town interests.\r\n\r\nBoth Bill and I were feeling what amounted to a world hunger, the pull\r\nand haul towards wider horizons. For him Paris was still over the next\r\nhill. I was not able to express my discontent with the futility of my\r\npresent course, but after my experience as a nurse with fundamentals\r\nthis quiet withdrawal into the tame domesticity of the pretty riverside\r\nsettlement seemed to be bordering on stagnation. I felt as though we had\r\ndrifted into a swamp, but we would not wait for the tide to set us free.\r\n\r\nIt was hopeless to emphasize the importance of practical necessities to\r\nan artist, and consequently I decided to resume nursing in order to earn\r\nmy share. We had spent years building our home and used it only for a\r\nbrief while. I was glad to leave when, in one of our financial doldrums,\r\nwe plunged back into the rushing stream of New York life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Six_\r\n\r\n                     FANATICS OF THEIR PURE IDEALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe took an apartment way uptown. It was the old-fashioned railroad\r\ntype—big, high-ceilinged, with plenty of room, air, and light. The\r\nchildren’s grandmother came to live with us and her presence gave me\r\nease of mind when I was called on a case; my children were utterly safe\r\nin her care.\r\n\r\nHeadlong we dived into one of the most interesting phases of life the\r\nUnited States has ever seen. Radicalism in manners, art, industry,\r\nmorals, politics was effervescing, and the lid was about to blow off in\r\nthe Great War. John Spargo, an authority on Karl Marx, had translated\r\n_Das Kapital_ into English, thus giving impetus to Socialism. Lincoln\r\nSteffens had published _The Shame of the Cities_, George Fitzpatrick had\r\nproduced _War, What For?_, a strange and wonderful arraignment of\r\ncapitalism, which sold thousands of copies.\r\n\r\nThe names of Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso first became familiar sounds\r\non this side of the Atlantic at the time of the notable Armory\r\nExhibition, when outstanding examples of impressionist and cubist\r\npainting were imported from Europe. But there was so much of\r\neccentricity—a leg on top of a head, a hat on a foot, the _Nude\r\nDescending a Staircase_, all in the name of art—that you had to close\r\none eye to look at it. The Armory vibrated; it shook New York.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bill had studied according to the old school, he could see the\r\npoint of view of the radical in art, and in politics as well. His\r\nattitude towards the underdog was much like father’s. He had always been\r\na Socialist, although not active, and held his friend Eugene V. Debs in\r\nhigh esteem.\r\n\r\nA religion without a name was spreading over the country. The converts\r\nwere liberals, Socialists, anarchists, revolutionists of all shades.\r\nThey were as fixed in their faith in the coming revolution as ever any\r\nPrimitive Christian in the immediate establishment of the Kingdom of\r\nGod. Some could even predict the exact date of its advent.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the scale of rebels and scoffers were the “pink”\r\nparliamentarian socialists and theorists at whom anarchists hurled the\r\ninsult “bourgeois.” At the other were the Industrial Workers of the\r\nWorld, the “Wobblies,” advocating unionization of the whole industry\r\nrather than the craft or trade. This was to be brought about, if need\r\nbe, by direct action.\r\n\r\nAlmost without knowing it you became a “comrade.” You could either\r\nbelong to a group that believed civilization was to be saved by the vote\r\nand by protective legislation, or go further to the left and believe\r\nwith the anarchists in the integrity of the individual, and that it was\r\npossible to develop human character to the point where laws and police\r\nwere unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe mental stirring was such as to make a near Renaissance. Everybody\r\nwas writing on the nebulous “new liberties.” Practically always people\r\ncould be found to support leaders or magazines, although many of the\r\nlatter lived for hardly more than a single issue.\r\n\r\nUpton Sinclair was utilizing his gift for vivid expression and righteous\r\nwrath in trying to correct social abuses by the indirect but highly\r\neffective method of story-telling. _The Jungle_ was a powerful exposé of\r\nthe capitalist meat industry responsible for the “embalmed beef” which\r\nhad poisoned American soldiers in ’98. Courageous as he was, he was yet\r\nmistrusted by the Socialist Old Guard as being a Silk Hat Radical who\r\nretained his bourgeois philosophy. Furthermore, he had been divorced,\r\nand divorce at that time was something of a scandal. Though anarchists\r\nminded such details not a whit, Socialists were imbued with all the\r\nrespectabilities; to most of these home-loving Germans, only the form of\r\ngovernment needed change.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the party was trying to separate itself from this\r\nGerman influence, and the standard bearer of the American concept was\r\nthe magnetic and beloved Debs. Not himself an intellectual, he did not\r\nneed to be; he was intelligent. Risen as he had from the ranks of the\r\nrailroad workers, he knew their hardships from experience. Though I am\r\nnot sure he actually was tall, he gave the illusion of height because of\r\nhis thinness and stooping shoulders. He was all flame, like a fire\r\nspirit. That was probably why the members of his coterie followed him so\r\ngladly.\r\n\r\nOur living room became a gathering place where liberals, anarchists,\r\nSocialists, and I.W.W.’s could meet. These vehement individualists had\r\nto have an audience, preferably a small, intimate one. They really came\r\nto see Bill; I made the cocoa. I used to listen in, not at all sure my\r\nopinions would be accepted by this very superior group. When I did\r\nmeekly venture something, I was quite likely to find myself on the\r\nopposite side—right in a left crowd and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAny evening you might find visitors from the Middle West being aroused\r\nby Jack Reed, bullied by Bill Haywood, led softly towards anarchist\r\nthought by Alexander Berkman. When throats grew dry and the flood of\r\noratory waned, someone went out for hamburger sandwiches, hot dogs, and\r\nbeer, paid for by all. The luxuriousness of the midnight repast depended\r\nupon the collection of coins tossed into the middle of the table, which\r\nconsisted of about what everybody had in his pocket. These considerate\r\nfriends never imposed a burden either of extra work or extra expense. In\r\nthe kitchen everyone sliced, buttered, opened cans. As soon as all were\r\nreplenished, the conversation was resumed practically where it had left\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBoth right-wingers and left-wingers who ordinarily objected to those in\r\nbetween loved Jack Reed, the master reporter just out of Harvard. He\r\nrefused to conform to the rule and rote of either, though his natural\r\ninclination appeared to be more in harmony with direct action.\r\n\r\nBehind this most highly intellectual young man loomed an uncouth,\r\nstumbling, one-eyed giant with an enormous head which he tended to hold\r\non one side. Big Bill Haywood looked like a bull about to plunge into an\r\narena. He seemed always glancing warily this way and that with his one\r\neye, head slightly turned as though to get the view of you. His great\r\nvoice boomed; his speech was crude and so were his manners; his\r\nphilosophy was that of the mining camps, where he had spent his life.\r\nBut I soon found out that for gentleness and sympathy he had not his\r\nequal. He was blunt because he was simple and direct. Though he was not\r\ntailor-made, he was custom-made.\r\n\r\nBecause Big Bill’s well-wishers saw so much that was fine in him, they\r\nwanted to smooth off the jagged edges. When they tried to polish his\r\nspeeches, Jack Reed objected, saying, “Give him a free hand. He\r\nexpresses what you and I think much more dramatically than we can. Don’t\r\ntry to stop him! We should encourage him.”\r\n\r\nOne of Big Bill’s best friends, Jessie Ashley, was, without meaning to\r\nbe, a taming influence. These two were the oddest combination in the\r\nworld—old Bill with his one eye, stubby, roughened fingernails,\r\nuncreased trousers, and shoddy clothes for which he refused to pay more\r\nthan the minimum; Jessie with Boston accent and horn-rimmed glasses, a\r\ncompromise between spectacles and lorgnette, from which dangled a black\r\nribbon, the ultimate word in eccentric decoration.\r\n\r\nJessie was one of the most conspicuous of the many men and women of long\r\npedigree who were revolting against family tradition. She was the\r\ndaughter of the President of the New York School of Law, and sister of\r\nits dean. When her brother had organized the first women’s law class,\r\nshe had been his pupil and later had become the first woman lawyer in\r\nNew York City. Her peculiarly honest mind was tolerant towards others,\r\nbut uncompromising towards herself. It was said of her truly that she\r\nwas always in the forefront when it took courage to be there; always in\r\nthe background when there was credit to be gained. A Socialist in\r\npractice as well as theory, she spent large portions of her income in\r\ngetting radicals out of jail, and her own legal experience she gave\r\nfreely in their behalf. Nevertheless, her appearances at strike meetings\r\nwere slightly uncomfortable; class tension rose up in waves.\r\n\r\nMany others were trying to pull themselves out of the rut of tradition.\r\nAlexander Berkman, the gentle anarchist, understood them all. He had\r\njust been freed after fourteen years’ imprisonment for his attempt to\r\nassassinate Henry Clay Frick during the Homestead Steel strike of 1892.\r\nHis emergence had stirred anarchism up again, and particularly its credo\r\nof pure individualism—to stand on your own and be yourself, never to\r\nhave one person dictate to another, even parent to child.\r\n\r\nBerkman’s appearance belied his reputation—blond, blue-eyed, slightly\r\nbuilt, with thinnish hair, and sensitive, mobile face and hands. He was\r\na thoughtful ascetic, believing sincerely that the quickest way to focus\r\nattention on social outrages was to commit some dramatic act, however\r\nviolent or antipathetic it might be to his nature—and then suffer the\r\nconsequences. He was not at all embittered by his sojourn in jail, and\r\nhad a great sense of humor, coupled with his most extraordinary\r\nunderstanding of the strange congeries of people who were about to be\r\nmelted down into his glowing crucible of truth.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Gurley Flynn had made the transition from Catholicism, Jack\r\nReed from being a “Harvard man,” Mabel Dodge from being a society\r\nmatron. They all had had to get over being class conscious, and acquire\r\ninstead the consciousness of the class struggle. Berkman made friends\r\nwith all, and when they were faced by problems apparently\r\ninsurmountable, he advised them on their spiritual journey, and\r\nsupported and backed them. For this reason he was beloved by all who\r\nencountered his most gracious charm.\r\n\r\nThis was not the way of Emma Goldman, whose habit was to berate and lash\r\nwith the language of scorn. She was never satisfied until people had\r\narrived at her own doorstep and accepted the dogma she had woven for\r\nherself. Short, stocky, even stout, a true Russian peasant type, her\r\nfigure indicated strength of body and strength of character, and this\r\nimpression was enhanced by her firm step and reliant walk. Though I\r\ndisliked both her ideas and her methods I admired her; she was really\r\nlike a spring house-cleaning to the sloppy thinking of the average\r\nAmerican. Our Government suffered in the estimation of the liberal world\r\nwhen she and Berkman were expelled from the country.\r\n\r\nOf all the strange places for these diverse personalities to meet, none\r\nmore strange could have been found than in Mabel Dodge’s salon, which\r\nburst upon New York like a rocket. Mabel belonged to one of the old\r\nfamilies of Buffalo, but neither in thought nor action was she orthodox.\r\nOnly in the luxurious appointments of her home did she conform.\r\n\r\nAmong the sights and memories I shall never forget were her famous\r\nsoirées at Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. A certain one typical of all\r\nthe others comes to mind; the whole gamut of liberalism had collected in\r\nher spacious drawing-room before an open fire. Cross-legged on the\r\nfloor, in the best Bohemian tradition, were Wobblies with uncut hair,\r\nunshaven faces, leaning against valuable draperies. Their clothes may\r\nhave been unkempt, but their eyes were ablaze with interest and\r\nintelligence. Each knew his own side of the subject as well as any\r\nscholar. You had to inform yourself to be in the liberal movement. Ideas\r\nwere respected, but you had to back them up with facts. Expressions of\r\nmere emotion, unleashed from reason, could not be let loose to wander\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nListener more than talker, Mabel sat near the hearth, brown bangs\r\noutlining a white face, simply gowned in velvet, beautifully arched foot\r\nbeating the air. For two hours I watched fascinatedly that silken ankle\r\nnever ceasing its violent agitation.\r\n\r\nThe topic of conversation turned out to be direct action. Big Bill was\r\nthe figure of the evening, but everybody was looking for an opportunity\r\nto talk. Each believed he had a key to the gates of Heaven; each was\r\ntrying to convert the others. It could not exactly have been called a\r\ndebate, because a single person held the floor as long as he could.\r\nThen, at one of his most effective periods, somebody else half rose and\r\ninterposed a “But—” The speaker hurried on; at his next telling sentence\r\ncame other “But—s,” until finally he was downed by the weight of\r\ninterruptions. In the end, conversions were nil; all were convinced\r\nbeforehand either for or against, and I never knew them to shift ground.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to laugh about it now, but nobody could have been more\r\nserious and determined than we were in those days.\r\n\r\nJust before the argument reached the stage of fist fights, the big doors\r\nwere thrown open and the butler announced, “Madam, supper is served.”\r\nMany of the boys had never heard those words, but one and all jumped up\r\nwith alacrity from the floor and discussion was, for the moment at\r\nleast, postponed. The wide, generous table in the dining room was\r\nburdened with beef, cold turkey, hot ham—hearty meat for hungry souls.\r\nOn a side table were pitchers of lemonade, siphons, bottles of rye and\r\nScotch.\r\n\r\nMabel never stirred while the banquet raged, but continued to sit, her\r\nfoot still beating the air, and talked with the few who did not choose\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nThe class contrasts encountered in a gathering there were not unique.\r\nThey were to be found elsewhere, even in matrimony. When the wealthy J.\r\nG. Phelps Stokes married Rose Pastor, the Russian-Jewish cigar maker,\r\nboth families felt equally outraged; he was practically sent to Coventry\r\nby his former associates and the Jews regarded her as a renegade because\r\nshe wore a silver cross about her neck. William English Walling, the\r\nlast word in Newport, married Anna Strunsky, the last word in the Jewish\r\nintelligentsia, and himself became a leading literary critic on the\r\nradical side.\r\n\r\nHarvard had been turning out liberals by the dozen, and all of them were\r\nplaying hob with accepted conventions in thought. One of these was\r\nWalter Lippmann, others were Norman Hapgood and his brother, Hutchins.\r\n“Hutch” was then working on the _Globe_, a paper which because of its\r\nbroad editorial policy was preferred by many radicals to the _Call_. He\r\nstood by Bill Haywood and Emma Goldman, although he had much more to\r\nlose economically and socially than the out-and-out reds.\r\n\r\nThe anarchists seldom initiated anything, because they did not have the\r\npersonnel or the equipment, but when something else was started which\r\nappeared to have any good in it, they came right in. This they did with\r\nthe Ferrer School on Twelfth Street near Fourth Avenue, in the founding\r\nof which Hutch, with the liberal journalist, Leonard Abbott, and the\r\nauthor, Manuel Komroff, were moving spirits. The object was to provide a\r\nform of education more progressive than that offered by the public\r\nschools, and its name was intended to perpetuate the memory of the\r\nrecently martyred Spanish libertarian, Francisco Ferrer, who had\r\nestablished modern free schools in Spain in which science and evolution\r\nhad been taught.\r\n\r\nLola Ridge, intense rebel from Australia, was the organizing secretary,\r\nRobert Henri and George Bellows gave lessons in art, and a young man\r\nnamed Will Durant was chosen to direct the younger children, combining\r\nin his teaching Froebel, Montessori, and other new methods. Under him we\r\nenrolled Stuart.\r\n\r\nWill Durant was of French-Canadian ancestry. His mother had worked hard\r\nto put him through a Jesuit seminary, but just before taking the vows he\r\nhad abandoned the priesthood. While he had been studying he had read\r\nKrafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis and was prepared to acquaint New York\r\nwith the facts of sex psychology. Sitting nonchalantly to deliver his\r\nlectures, which evidenced scholarly background and research, he advanced\r\nto his small but serious audience practically the first public\r\nexpression of this intimate subject.\r\n\r\nThe young instructor created rather a problem for the directors by\r\nunexpectedly marrying a pupil, Ida Kaufman, commonly called Puck. I\r\nremember one Saturday when she was romping with Stuart, and my laundress\r\nsaid to her, “Why, you’re so young to be married. Do you like it?”\r\n\r\nPuck replied, “Oh, I don’t care, but I’d much rather play marbles.”\r\n\r\nIntellectuals were then flocking to enlist under the flag of\r\nhumanitarianism, and as soon as anybody evinced human sympathies he was\r\ndeemed a Socialist. My own personal feelings drew me towards the\r\nindividualist, anarchist philosophy, and I read Kropotkin, Bakunin, and\r\nFourier, but it seemed to me necessary to approach the ideal by way of\r\nSocialism; as long as the earning of food, clothing, and shelter was on\r\na competitive basis, man could never develop any true independence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I joined the Socialist Party, Local Number Five, itself\r\nsomething of a rebel in the ranks, which, against the wishes of the\r\ncentral authority, had been responsible for bringing Bill Haywood East\r\nafter his release from prison. The members—Italian, Jewish, Russian,\r\nGerman, Spanish, a pretty good mixture—used the rooms over a\r\nneighborhood shop as a meeting place and there they were to be found\r\nevery evening reading and discussing politics.\r\n\r\nSomebody had donated a sum of money to be spent to interest women in\r\nSocialism. As proof that we were not necessarily like the masculine,\r\naggressive, bulldog, window-smashing suffragettes in England, I, an\r\nAmerican and a mother of children, was selected to recruit new members\r\namong the clubs of working women. The Scandinavians, who had a\r\nhousemaids’ union, were the most satisfactory; they already leaned\r\ntowards liberalism.\r\n\r\nGrant, who was as yet too young to go to school, wholeheartedly\r\ndisapproved of my political activities. Once when I was about to depart\r\nfor the evening he climbed up on my lap and said, “Are you going to a\r\nmeeting?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A soshist meeting?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I hate soshism!”\r\n\r\nEverybody else was amused when the Sangers went to a Socialist meeting.\r\nIf I had an idea, I leaned over and whispered it to Bill, who waved his\r\nhand and called for attention. “Margaret has something to say on that.\r\nHave you heard Margaret?” Many men might have labeled my opinions silly,\r\nand, indeed, I was not at all sure of them myself, but Bill thought if I\r\nhad one, it was worth hearing.\r\n\r\nJohn Block and his wife, Anita, were ardent workers for the cause. She\r\nwas a grand person, a Barnard graduate and editor of the woman’s page of\r\nthe _Call_. She telephoned me one evening, “Will you help me out? We\r\nhave a lecture scheduled for tonight and our speaker is unable to come.\r\nWon’t you take her place?”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t speak. I’ve never made a speech in my life.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll simply have to do it. There isn’t anybody I can get, and I’m\r\ndepending on you.”\r\n\r\n“How many will be there?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Only about ten. You’ve nothing to be frightened of.”\r\n\r\nBut I was frightened—thoroughly so. I could not eat my supper. Shaking\r\nand quaking I faced the little handful of women who had come after their\r\nlong working hours for enlightenment. Since I did not consider myself\r\nqualified to speak on labor, I switched the subject to health, with\r\nwhich I was more familiar. This, it appeared, was something new. They\r\nwere pleased and said to Anita, “Let’s have more health talks.” The\r\nsecond time we met the audience had swelled to seventy-five and\r\narrangements were made to continue the lectures, if such they could be\r\ncalled, which I prepared while my patients slept.\r\n\r\nThe young mothers in the group asked so many questions about their\r\nintimate family life that I mentioned it to Anita. “Just the thing,” she\r\nsaid. “Write up your answers and we’ll try them out in the _Call_.” The\r\nresult was the first composition I had ever done for publication, a\r\nseries under the general title, _What Every Mother Should Know_. I\r\nattempted, as I had with the Hastings children, to introduce the\r\nimpersonality of nature in order to break through the rigid\r\nconsciousness of sex on the part of parents, who were inclined to be too\r\nintensely personal about it.\r\n\r\nThen Anita requested a second series to be called _What Every Girl\r\nShould Know_. The motif was, “If the mother can impress the child with\r\nthe beauty and wonder and sacredness of the sex function, she has taught\r\nit the first lesson.”\r\n\r\nThese articles ran along for three or four weeks until one Sunday\r\nmorning I turned to the _Call_ to see my precious little effort, and,\r\ninstead, encountered a newspaper box two columns wide in which was\r\nprinted in black letters,\r\n\r\n                      WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW\r\n\r\n                                 ┌───┐\r\n                                 │ N │\r\n                                 │ O │\r\n                                 │ T │\r\n                                 │ H │\r\n                                 │ I │\r\n                                 │ N │\r\n                                 │ G │\r\n                                 │ ! │\r\n                                 └───┘\r\n\r\n                              BY ORDER OF\r\n                       THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nThe words gonorrhea and syphilis had occurred in that article and\r\nAnthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of\r\nVice, did not like them. By the so-called Comstock Law of 1873, which\r\nhad been adroitly pushed through a busy Congress on the eve of\r\nadjournment, the Post Office had been given authority to decide what\r\nmight be called lewd, lascivious, indecent, or obscene, and this\r\nextraordinary man had been granted the extraordinary power, alone of all\r\ncitizens of the United States, to open any letter or package or pamphlet\r\nor book passing through the mails and, if he wished, lay his complaint\r\nbefore the Post Office. So powerful had his society become that anything\r\nto which he objected in its name was almost automatically barred; he had\r\nturned out to be sole censor for ninety million people. During some\r\nforty years Comstock had been damming the rising tide of new thought,\r\nthereby causing much harm, and only now was his hopeless contest against\r\n_September Morn_ making him absurd and an object of ridicule.\r\n\r\nBut at this same time also John D. Rockefeller, Jr. was organizing the\r\nBureau of Social Hygiene, in part to educate the working public\r\nregarding what were politely termed “social evils.” A fine start was\r\nbeing made although no surveys had been completed. Lacking data,\r\nlecturers had to speak in generalities. Nevertheless, to me, who had sat\r\nthrough hours of highly academic exposition expressed in cultivated\r\ntones, their approach seemed timorous and their words disguised with\r\nverbiage. I saw no reason why these facts could not be given in a few\r\nminutes in language simple enough for anyone to understand.\r\n\r\nWhen my series was finished it was printed in pamphlet form. I sent a\r\ncopy to Dr. Prince Morrow of the Bureau, asking for his opinion and any\r\ncorrections he might suggest for the next edition; to my delight he\r\nreplied he would like to see it spread by the million. The Bureau had\r\nnames and backing but was not proceeding very fast towards educating\r\nworking people regarding venereal disease; the articles in the _Call_,\r\non the other hand, were reaching this same class by the thousand—yet the\r\none which mentioned syphilis was suppressed.\r\n\r\nI continued assiduously to write pieces for the _Call_. One of these\r\nreported the laundry strike in New York City in the winter of 1912,\r\nunauthorized by Samuel Gompers and his American Federation of Labor,\r\nwhich claimed it alone had the right to declare strikes. To get the\r\ndetails I went into the houses of the Irish Amazons, who with their\r\nhusbands had walked out without being called out, simply because they\r\ncould not stand it any longer. They were the hardest worked, the poorest\r\npaid, had the most protracted and irregular hours of any union members.\r\nOne man described his typical day: he rose at five, had ten minutes for\r\nlunch, less for supper, and dragged himself home at eleven at night. I\r\nwas glad they had the courage to rebel, and it took courage to be a\r\npicket—getting up so early on bitterly cold mornings and waiting and\r\nwaiting to waylay the strikebreakers and argue with them. The police\r\nwere ready to pounce when the boss pointed out the ringleaders.\r\n\r\nThis was the only time I came in contact with men and women on strike\r\ntogether. I could see the men had two things in their minds: one\r\neconomic—the two-dollar extra wage and the shorter hours they might win;\r\nthe other political—the coming of the social revolution. The women\r\nreally cared for neither of these. Dominating each was the relationship\r\nbetween her husband, her children, and herself. She might complain of\r\nbeing tired and not having enough money, but always she connected both\r\nwith too many offspring.\r\n\r\nSome of the strikers thought I might help them out, but I was not at all\r\nsure I believed either in direct action or legislation as a remedy for\r\ntheir difficulties. This lack of conviction prevented me from having the\r\nnecessary force to aid them organize themselves, and in such an\r\nemergency a forceful leader was called for. The night of their rally I\r\nwas amazed at the complete confusion. Anybody could speak—and was doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI felt helpless in the midst of this chaos, and distressed at their\r\nhelplessness. But I knew the person who could manage the situation\r\neffectively, and so I sent for Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a direct\r\nactionist identified with the I.W.W. Her father, Tom Flynn, a labor\r\norganizer, was the same type of philosophical rebel as my father, long\r\non conversation but short on work. Elizabeth had been out in the logging\r\ncamps of the West, where she had won the complete adoration of the\r\nlumberjacks. At her tongue’s end were the words and phrases they\r\nunderstood, and she knew exactly the right note to stir them.\r\n\r\nElizabeth stood on the platform, dramatically beautiful with her black\r\nhair and deep blue eyes, her cream-white complexion set off by the\r\nflaming scarf she always wore about her throat. Nothing if not\r\noutspoken, she started by saying it was folly for the strikers to give\r\nup their bread and butter by walking out. They could achieve their ends\r\nmore quickly if they threw hypothetical _sabots_ into the machinery. “If\r\na shirt comes in from a man who wears size fifteen, send him back an\r\neighteen. Replace a dress shirt with a blue denim. That’s what the\r\nlaundry workers of France did, and brought the employers to their\r\nknees.”\r\n\r\nThe audience was being held spellbound by this instruction in the fine\r\nart of sabotage when some of Gompers’ strong-arm men appeared, and the\r\nbattle was on. They tramped up on the stage, moved furniture and chairs\r\nabout, made so much noise Elizabeth’s voice could not be heard, and\r\nfinally ejected some of her sympathizers.\r\n\r\nIt was probably better in the end that the American Federation of Labor\r\neventually took the laundry workers under its wing, because the I.W.W.\r\nwas not an organized body, but merely an agitational force which\r\nscarcely had the necessary strength to lead a successful strike in New\r\nYork City. Its influence in Lawrence, Massachusetts, was far more\r\npotent. Joe Ettor, once bootblack in California, with Arturo Giovanitti,\r\nscholar, idealist, poet, and editor of _Il Proletario_, had been\r\nstirring up the unorganized textile strikers with impassioned eloquence.\r\nSo compelling were the words of these two that workers of seven\r\nnationalities, chiefly Italian, had walked out spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe accidental shooting of a girl picket provided an excuse, farfetched\r\nas it may seem, to jail the firebrands, Ettor and Giovanitti, who were\r\ncharged with being “accessories _before_ the fact,” which meant they\r\nwere accused of having known beforehand she was going to be shot by the\r\npolice and were, therefore, responsible. Now, the strikers had martyrs,\r\nand the I.W.W. heroes of the West poured in to help. Bill Haywood,\r\nWilliam E. Trautman of the United Brewery Workers, Carlo Tresca, editor\r\nand owner of an Italian paper in New York, contributed to put on the\r\nbiggest show the East had ever seen—parades, banners, songs, speeches.\r\n\r\nThe entire Italian population of America was aroused. These were then a\r\npeople unto themselves. For much longer than the two generations\r\ncustomary among other immigrant races they retained their habits,\r\ntraditions, and language, ate their own type of food and read their own\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nItalians in New York who were in accord with the strikers decided on a\r\nstep, novel in this country although it had been tried in Italy and\r\nBelgium. The primary reason for the failure of all labor rebellions was\r\nthe hunger cries of the babies; if they were only fed the strikers could\r\nusually last out. It was determined to bring the children of the textile\r\nworkers to New York, where they could be taken care of until the issue\r\nwas settled. This resolution was made without knowing how many there\r\nmight be; provision would be forthcoming somehow.\r\n\r\nAgain because I was an American, a nurse, and reputed to be sympathetic\r\nto their cause and the cause of children, the committee asked me with\r\nJohn Di Gregorio and Carrie Giovanitti to fetch the youngsters. As soon\r\nas I agreed, telephone calls were put through to Lawrence, and a\r\ndelegate took the midnight train to make the preliminary arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe found the boys and girls gathered in a Lawrence public hall and,\r\nbefore we started, I insisted on physical examinations for contagious\r\ndiseases. One, though ill with diphtheria, had been working up to the\r\ntime of the strike. Almost all had adenoids and enlarged tonsils. Each,\r\nwithout exception, was incredibly emaciated.\r\n\r\nOur hundred and nineteen charges were of every age, from babies of two\r\nor three to older ones of twelve to thirteen. Although the latter had\r\nbeen employed in the textile mills, their garments were simply worn to\r\nshreds. Not a child had on any woolen clothing whatsoever, and only four\r\nwore overcoats. Never in all my nursing in the slums had I seen children\r\nin so ragged and deplorable a condition. The February weather was\r\nbitter, and we had to run them to the station. There the parents, with\r\ntears in their eyes and gratitude in their hearts, relinquished their\r\nshivering offspring.\r\n\r\nThe wind was even icier when we reached Boston, and money was scarce. I\r\nhad only enough for railroad fares and none for chartering buses or\r\nhiring taxis. Consequently, again we had to scurry on foot from the\r\nNorth to the South Station. But, once more on the train, great was the\r\nenthusiasm of the boys and girls, who entertained themselves by singing\r\nthe _Marseillaise_ and the _Internationale_. All knew the words as well\r\nas the tunes, though the former might be in Polish, Hungarian, French,\r\nGerman, Italian, and even English. The children who sang those songs are\r\nnow grown up. I wonder how they regard the present state of the world.\r\n\r\nAs we neared New York I began to worry about our arrival. We were all\r\nweary. Would preparations have been made to feed this hungry mob and\r\nhouse it for the night? But I should have trusted the deep feeling and\r\nthe dramatic instinct of the Italians. Thousands of men and women were\r\nwaiting. As my assistants and I left the train, looking like three Pied\r\nPipers followed by our ragged cohorts, the crowd pushed through the\r\npolice lines, leaped the ropes, caught up the children as they came, and\r\nhoisted them to their shoulders. I was seized by both arms and I, too,\r\nhad the illusion of being swept from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe committee had secured permission to parade to Webster Hall near\r\nUnion Square. Our tired feet fell into the rhythm of the band. As we\r\nswung along singing, laughing, crying, big banners bellying and torches\r\nflaring, sidewalk throngs shouted and whistled and applauded.\r\n\r\nAt Webster Hall supper was ready in plentiful quantity. Many of our\r\nsmall guests were so unused to sitting at table that they did not know\r\nhow to behave. Like shy animals they tried to take cover, carrying their\r\nplates to a chair, a box, anything handy. Almost all snatched at their\r\nfood with both fists and stuffed it down, they were so hungry.\r\n\r\nSocialists had not initiated this fight but they were in it. Many had\r\ncome to offer shelter for the duration of the strike—perhaps six weeks,\r\nperhaps six months, perhaps a year—with visions in their minds of\r\nbeautiful, starry-eyed, helpless little ones. Instead they were\r\npresented with bedraggled urchins, many of whom had never seen a\r\ntoothbrush. But they rallied round magnificently; I cannot speak too\r\nhighly of them.\r\n\r\nIt was a responsibility to apportion the children properly, but I had\r\nwilling and intelligent help. The Poles had sent a Polish delegate, the\r\nFrench had sent a French delegate, and so on, in order that all might be\r\nplaced in homes where they could be understood. Luckily several families\r\nwere willing to take more than one child so that we were usually able to\r\nkeep brother and sister together. Each, before it was handed over, was\r\ngiven a medical examination. The temporary foster-parents had to promise\r\nto write the real parents, and also to send a weekly report to the\r\ncommittee of how their charges were getting on. The tabulation was\r\nthorough, and not until four in the morning did the last of us go to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe next week, ninety-two more children were brought down, but I had no\r\npart in this, because I was on a case. Hysteria had now risen to such a\r\nheight that some of the parents at the Lawrence Station were beaten and\r\narrested by the police. Victor Berger of Wisconsin, the only Socialist\r\nmember of Congress, asked for an investigation of circumstances leading\r\nup to the walkout. Although I had not been identified with it, he\r\nrequested me to be present at the hearings.\r\n\r\nWhen Gompers testified, he literally shook with rage, and it seemed to\r\nme he was about to have apoplexy. The mill owners charged that the whole\r\naffair had been staged solely for notoriety and that the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children should step in.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the witnesses for the strikers were not well-documented.\r\nWhen it was obvious that the Congressional Committee was not receiving\r\nthe correct impression, Berger asked me to take the stand and describe\r\nthe condition of the children as I had seen them. Writing up statistics\r\non hospital reports had given me the habit of classification. I was able\r\nfrom my brief notes to answer every question as to their nationalities,\r\ntheir ages, their weights, the number of those without underclothes and\r\nwithout overcoats. Senator Warren Gamaliel Harding led the inquiry, and\r\nI could see he was in sympathy with my vehement replies.\r\n\r\nThe publicity had been so well managed by the Italians and their leaders\r\nthat popular opinion turned in favor of the strikers, and they\r\neventually won. At the end of March the little refugees, who had\r\nendeared themselves to their foster-parents, went back to the mill\r\ndistrict. It was hard to recognize the same children of six weeks\r\nbefore, plumped up and dressed in new clothes. In November Ettor and\r\nGiovanitti were acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe Paterson silk strike of the next year, in which the workers were\r\nagain predominantly Italian, may have been as important as the one at\r\nLawrence, but it was by no means so obviously dramatic. Paterson was a\r\ngloomy city, and, as a river, the Passaic was sadder than the Merrimac.\r\nThough the leadership was far more cohesive, caution was evidenced on\r\nevery hand. Its chief interest to me lay in Bill Haywood’s\r\nparticipation. At Lawrence he had only been one of the committee,\r\nwhereas at Paterson he was in charge for the first time in the East.\r\nAlways before he had advised strikers to “take it on the chin” and not\r\nbe too gentle in hitting back. But here, before ten thousand crowding up\r\nto the rostrum, I heard him warn, “Keep your hands in your pockets, men,\r\nand nobody can say you are shooting.”\r\n\r\nAn American was apt to be at a disadvantage in handling foreigners,\r\nparticularly when they felt aggrieved. They objected to his manner of\r\ngoing about things, so different from their own, and he, on the other\r\nhand, could not fully understand their psychology, and had the added\r\nobstacle of being compelled to work through an intermediary in language.\r\n\r\nAt Paterson the Italian groups were not behind Bill. As soon as he began\r\nto temper his language and sound a more wary note of advice, his\r\nonce-faithful adherents repudiated him. His clarion call of “Hands in\r\nthe Pockets,” which was intended to create favorable popular opinion by\r\nproving them “good boys,” had actually _tied_ their hands, and\r\ndetectives beat and bullied them just the same. The public was not\r\nimpressed and they were resentful. They claimed he did not have the old\r\nfighting spirit he had shown when directing the miners of the West, he\r\nwas getting soft, he was a sick man. Although he had actually progressed\r\ntactically and left them where they were, from that time on he lost his\r\npower of leadership.\r\n\r\nFollowing the method which had been so successful at Lawrence, Jack Reed\r\nendeavored to dramatize direct action in an enormous pageant at Madison\r\nSquare Garden. He even had pallbearers carry an actual coffin into the\r\nhall to pictorialize the funeral of a worker who had been shot at\r\nPaterson. I could feel a tremor go through the audience, but, on the\r\nwhole, conviction was lacking.\r\n\r\nThe pageant was a fitting conclusion to one period of my life. I believe\r\nthat we all had our parts to play. Some had important ones; some were\r\nthere to lend support to a scene; some were merely voices off stage.\r\nEach, whatever his role, was essential. I only walked on, but it had its\r\ninfluence in my future.\r\n\r\nNo matter to what degree I might participate in strikes, I always came\r\nback to the idea which was beginning to obsess me—that something more\r\nwas needed to assuage the condition of the very poor. It was both absurd\r\nand futile to struggle over pennies when fast-coming babies required\r\ndollars to feed them.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly despondent after the Paterson debacle, and had a\r\nsickening feeling that there was to be no end; it seemed to me the whole\r\nquestion of strikes for higher wages was based on man’s economic need of\r\nsupporting his family, and that this was a shallow principle upon which\r\nto found a new civilization. Furthermore, I was enough of a Feminist to\r\nresent the fact that woman and her requirements were not being taken\r\ninto account in reconstructing this new world about which all were\r\ntalking. They were failing to consider the quality of life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Seven_\r\n\r\n                   THE TURBID EBB AND FLOW OF MISERY\r\n\r\n                   “_Every night and every morn\r\n                   Some to misery are born.\r\n                   Every morn and every night\r\n                   Some are born to sweet delight.\r\n                   Some are born to sweet delight,\r\n                   Some are born to endless night._”\r\n                                       WILLIAM BLAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these years in New York trained nurses were in great demand. Few\r\npeople wanted to enter hospitals; they were afraid they might be\r\n“practiced” upon, and consented to go only in desperate emergencies.\r\nSentiment was especially vehement in the matter of having babies. A\r\nwoman’s own bedroom, no matter how inconveniently arranged, was the\r\nusual place for her lying-in. I was not sufficiently free from domestic\r\nduties to be a general nurse, but I could ordinarily manage obstetrical\r\ncases because I was notified far enough ahead to plan my schedule. And\r\nafter serving my two weeks I could get home again.\r\n\r\nSometimes I was summoned to small apartments occupied by young clerks,\r\ninsurance salesmen, or lawyers, just starting out, most of them under\r\nthirty and whose wives were having their first or second baby. They were\r\nalways eager to know the best and latest method in infant care and\r\nfeeding. In particular, Jewish patients, whose lives centered around the\r\nfamily, welcomed advice and followed it implicitly.\r\n\r\nBut more and more my calls began to come from the Lower East Side, as\r\nthough I were being magnetically drawn there by some force outside my\r\ncontrol. I hated the wretchedness and hopelessness of the poor, and\r\nnever experienced that satisfaction in working among them that so many\r\nnoble women have found. My concern for my patients was now quite\r\ndifferent from my earlier hospital attitude. I could see that much was\r\nwrong with them which did not appear in the physiological or medical\r\ndiagnosis. A woman in childbirth was not merely a woman in childbirth.\r\nMy expanded outlook included a view of her background, her\r\npotentialities as a human being, the kind of children she was bearing,\r\nand what was going to happen to them.\r\n\r\nThe wives of small shopkeepers were my most frequent cases, but I had\r\ncarpenters, truck drivers, dishwashers, and pushcart vendors. I admired\r\nintensely the consideration most of these people had for their own.\r\nMoney to pay doctor and nurse had been carefully saved months in\r\nadvance—parents-in-law, grandfathers, grandmothers, all contributing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the neighbors learned that a nurse was in the building they\r\ncame in a friendly way to visit, often carrying fruit, jellies, or\r\ngefüllter fish made after a cherished recipe. It was infinitely pathetic\r\nto me that they, so poor themselves, should bring me food. Later they\r\ndrifted in again with the excuse of getting the plate, and sat down for\r\na nice talk; there was no hurry. Always back of the little gift was the\r\nquestion, “I am pregnant (or my daughter, or my sister is). Tell me\r\nsomething to keep from having another baby. We cannot afford another\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\nI tried to explain the only two methods I had ever heard of among the\r\nmiddle classes, both of which were invariably brushed aside as\r\nunacceptable. They were of no certain avail to the wife because they\r\nplaced the burden of responsibility solely upon the husband—a burden\r\nwhich he seldom assumed. What she was seeking was self-protection she\r\ncould herself use, and there was none.\r\n\r\nBelow this stratum of society was one in truly desperate circumstances.\r\nThe men were sullen and unskilled, picking up odd jobs now and then, but\r\nmore often unemployed, lounging in and out of the house at all hours of\r\nthe day and night. The women seemed to slink on their way to market and\r\nwere without neighborliness.\r\n\r\nThese submerged, untouched classes were beyond the scope of organized\r\ncharity or religion. No labor union, no church, not even the Salvation\r\nArmy reached them. They were apprehensive of everyone and rejected help\r\nof any kind, ordering all intruders to keep out; both birth and death\r\nthey considered their own business. Social agents, who were just\r\nbeginning to appear, were profoundly mistrusted because they pried into\r\nhomes and lives, asking questions about wages, how many were in the\r\nfamily, had any of them ever been in jail. Often two or three had been\r\nthere or were now under suspicion of prostitution, shoplifting, purse\r\nsnatching, petty thievery, and, in consequence, passed furtively by the\r\nbig blue uniforms on the corner.\r\n\r\nThe utmost depression came over me as I approached this surreptitious\r\nregion. Below Fourteenth Street I seemed to be breathing a different\r\nair, to be in another world and country where the people had habits and\r\ncustoms alien to anything I had ever heard about.\r\n\r\nThere were then approximately ten thousand apartments in New York into\r\nwhich no sun ray penetrated directly; such windows as they had opened\r\nonly on a narrow court from which rose fetid odors. It was seldom\r\ncleaned, though garbage and refuse often went down into it. All these\r\ndwellings were pervaded by the foul breath of poverty, that moldy,\r\nindefinable, indescribable smell which cannot be fumigated out,\r\nsickening to me but apparently unnoticed by those who lived there. When\r\nI set to work with antiseptics, their pungent sting, at least\r\ntemporarily, obscured the stench.\r\n\r\nI remember one confinement case to which I was called by the doctor of\r\nan insurance company. I climbed up the five flights and entered the\r\nairless rooms, but the baby had come with too great speed. A boy of ten\r\nhad been the only assistant. Five flights was a long way; he had wrapped\r\nthe placenta in a piece of newspaper and dropped it out the window into\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nMany families took in “boarders,” as they were termed, whose small\r\ncontributions paid the rent. These derelicts, wanderers, alternately\r\nworking and drinking, were crowded in with the children; a single room\r\nsometimes held as many as six sleepers. Little girls were accustomed to\r\ndressing and undressing in front of the men, and were often violated,\r\noccasionally by their own fathers or brothers, before they reached the\r\nage of puberty.\r\n\r\nPregnancy was a chronic condition among the women of this class.\r\nSuggestions as to what to do for a girl who was “in trouble” or a\r\nmarried woman who was “caught” passed from mouth to mouth—herb teas,\r\nturpentine, steaming, rolling downstairs, inserting slippery elm,\r\nknitting needles, shoe-hooks. When they had word of a new remedy they\r\nhurried to the drugstore, and if the clerk were inclined to be friendly\r\nhe might say, “Oh, that won’t help you, but here’s something that may.”\r\nThe younger druggists usually refused to give advice because, if it were\r\nto be known, they would come under the law; midwives were even more\r\nfearful. The doomed women implored me to reveal the “secret” rich people\r\nhad, offering to pay me extra to tell them; many really believed I was\r\nholding back information for money. They asked everybody and tried\r\nanything, but nothing did them any good. On Saturday nights I have seen\r\ngroups of from fifty to one hundred with their shawls over their heads\r\nwaiting outside the office of a five-dollar abortionist.\r\n\r\nEach time I returned to this district, which was becoming a recurrent\r\nnightmare, I used to hear that Mrs. Cohen “had been carried to a\r\nhospital, but had never come back,” or that Mrs. Kelly “had sent the\r\nchildren to a neighbor and had put her head into the gas oven.” Day\r\nafter day such tales were poured into my ears—a baby born dead, great\r\nrelief—the death of an older child, sorrow but again relief of a\r\nsort—the story told a thousand times of death from abortion and children\r\ngoing into institutions. I shuddered with horror as I listened to the\r\ndetails and studied the reasons back of them—destitution linked with\r\nexcessive childbearing. The waste of life seemed utterly senseless. One\r\nby one worried, sad, pensive, and aging faces marshaled themselves\r\nbefore me in my dreams, sometimes appealingly, sometimes accusingly.\r\n\r\nThese were not merely “unfortunate conditions among the poor” such as we\r\nread about. I knew the women personally. They were living, breathing,\r\nhuman beings, with hopes, fears, and aspirations like my own, yet their\r\nweary, misshapen bodies, “always ailing, never failing,” were destined\r\nto be thrown on the scrap heap before they were thirty-five. I could not\r\nescape from the facts of their wretchedness; neither was I able to see\r\nany way out. My own cozy and comfortable family existence was becoming a\r\nreproach to me.\r\n\r\nThen one stifling mid-July day of 1912 I was summoned to a Grand Street\r\ntenement. My patient was a small, slight Russian Jewess, about\r\ntwenty-eight years old, of the special cast of feature to which\r\nsuffering lends a madonna-like expression. The cramped three-room\r\napartment was in a sorry state of turmoil. Jake Sachs, a truck driver\r\nscarcely older than his wife, had come home to find the three children\r\ncrying and her unconscious from the effects of a self-induced abortion.\r\nHe had called the nearest doctor, who in turn had sent for me. Jake’s\r\nearnings were trifling, and most of them had gone to keep the\r\nnone-too-strong children clean and properly fed. But his wife’s\r\ningenuity had helped them to save a little, and this he was glad to\r\nspend on a nurse rather than have her go to a hospital.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and I settled ourselves to the task of fighting the\r\nsepticemia. Never had I worked so fast, never so concentratedly. The\r\nsultry days and nights were melted into a torpid inferno. It did not\r\nseem possible there could be such heat, and every bit of food, ice, and\r\ndrugs had to be carried up three flights of stairs.\r\n\r\nJake was more kind and thoughtful than many of the husbands I had\r\nencountered. He loved his children, and had always helped his wife wash\r\nand dress them. He had brought water up and carried garbage down before\r\nhe left in the morning, and did as much as he could for me while he\r\nanxiously watched her progress.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight Mrs. Sachs’ recovery was in sight. Neighbors,\r\nordinarily fatalistic as to the results of abortion, were genuinely\r\npleased that she had survived. She smiled wanly at all who came to see\r\nher and thanked them gently, but she could not respond to their hearty\r\ncongratulations. She appeared to be more despondent and anxious than she\r\nshould have been, and spent too much time in meditation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three weeks, as I was preparing to leave the fragile\r\npatient to take up her difficult life once more, she finally voiced her\r\nfears, “Another baby will finish me, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“It’s too early to talk about that,” I temporized.\r\n\r\nBut when the doctor came to make his last call, I drew him aside. “Mrs.\r\nSachs is terribly worried about having another baby.”\r\n\r\n“She well may be,” replied the doctor, and then he stood before her and\r\nsaid, “Any more such capers, young woman, and there’ll be no need to\r\nsend for me.”\r\n\r\n“I know, doctor,” she replied timidly, “but,” and she hesitated as\r\nthough it took all her courage to say it, “what can I do to prevent it?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a kindly man, and he had worked hard to save her, but\r\nsuch incidents had become so familiar to him that he had long since lost\r\nwhatever delicacy he might once have had. He laughed good-naturedly.\r\n“You want to have your cake and eat it too, do you? Well, it can’t be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nThen picking up his hat and bag to depart he said, “Tell Jake to sleep\r\non the roof.”\r\n\r\nI glanced quickly at Mrs. Sachs. Even through my sudden tears I could\r\nsee stamped on her face an expression of absolute despair. We simply\r\nlooked at each other, saying no word until the door had closed behind\r\nthe doctor. Then she lifted her thin, blue-veined hands and clasped them\r\nbeseechingly. “He can’t understand. He’s only a man. But you do, don’t\r\nyou? Please tell me the secret, and I’ll never breathe it to a soul.\r\n_Please!_”\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do? I could not speak the conventionally comforting\r\nphrases which would be of no comfort. Instead, I made her as physically\r\neasy as I could and promised to come back in a few days to talk with her\r\nagain. A little later, when she slept, I tiptoed away.\r\n\r\nNight after night the wistful image of Mrs. Sachs appeared before me. I\r\nmade all sorts of excuses to myself for not going back. I was busy on\r\nother cases; I really did not know what to say to her or how to convince\r\nher of my own ignorance; I was helpless to avert such monstrous\r\natrocities. Time rolled by and I did nothing.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang one evening three months later, and Jake Sachs’\r\nagitated voice begged me to come at once; his wife was sick again and\r\nfrom the same cause. For a wild moment I thought of sending someone\r\nelse, but actually, of course, I hurried into my uniform, caught up my\r\nbag, and started out. All the way I longed for a subway wreck, an\r\nexplosion, anything to keep me from having to enter that home again. But\r\nnothing happened, even to delay me. I turned into the dingy doorway and\r\nclimbed the familiar stairs once more. The children were there, young\r\nlittle things.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sachs was in a coma and died within ten minutes. I folded her still\r\nhands across her breast, remembering how they had pleaded with me,\r\nbegging so humbly for the knowledge which was her right. I drew a sheet\r\nover her pallid face. Jake was sobbing, running his hands through his\r\nhair and pulling it out like an insane person. Over and over again he\r\nwailed, “My God! My God! My God!”\r\n\r\nI left him pacing desperately back and forth, and for hours I myself\r\nwalked and walked and walked through the hushed streets. When I finally\r\narrived home and let myself quietly in, all the household was sleeping.\r\nI looked out my window and down upon the dimly lighted city. Its pains\r\nand griefs crowded in upon me, a moving picture rolled before my eyes\r\nwith photographic clearness: women writhing in travail to bring forth\r\nlittle babies; the babies themselves naked and hungry, wrapped in\r\nnewspapers to keep them from the cold; six-year-old children with\r\npinched, pale, wrinkled faces, old in concentrated wretchedness, pushed\r\ninto gray and fetid cellars, crouching on stone floors, their small\r\nscrawny hands scuttling through rags, making lamp shades, artificial\r\nflowers; white coffins, black coffins, coffins, coffins interminably\r\npassing in never-ending succession. The scenes piled one upon another on\r\nanother. I could bear it no longer.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there the darkness faded. The sun came up and threw its\r\nreflection over the house tops. It was the dawn of a new day in my life\r\nalso. The doubt and questioning, the experimenting and trying, were now\r\nto be put behind me. I knew I could not go back merely to keeping people\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nI went to bed, knowing that no matter what it might cost, I was finished\r\nwith palliatives and superficial cures; I was resolved to seek out the\r\nroot of evil, to do something to change the destiny of mothers whose\r\nmiseries were vast as the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Eight_\r\n\r\n                        I HAVE PROMISES TO KEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nHow were mothers to be saved? I went through many revolving doors,\r\nlooked around, and, not finding what I was seeking, came out again. I\r\ntalked incessantly to everybody who seemed to have social welfare at\r\nheart. Progressive women whom I consulted were thoroughly discouraging.\r\n“Wait until we get the vote. Then we’ll take care of that,” they assured\r\nme. I tried the Socialists. Here, there, and everywhere the reply came,\r\n“Wait until women have more education. Wait until we secure equal\r\ndistribution of wealth.” Wait for this and wait for that. Wait! Wait!\r\nWait!\r\n\r\nHaving no idea how powerful were the laws which laid a blanket of\r\nignorance over the medical profession as well as the laity, I asked\r\nvarious doctors of my acquaintance, “Why aren’t physicians doing\r\nsomething?”\r\n\r\n“The people you’re worrying about wouldn’t use contraception if they had\r\nit; they breed like rabbits. And, besides, there’s a law against it.”\r\n\r\n“Information does exist, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, but I doubt whether you can find it. Even if you do, you can’t\r\npass it on. Comstock’ll get you if you don’t watch out.”\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain something about this subject which was so\r\nmysterious and so unaccountably forbidden, I spent almost a year in the\r\nlibraries—the Astor, the Lenox, the Academy of Medicine, the Library of\r\nCongress, and dozens of others. Hoping that psychological treatises\r\nmight inform me, I read Auguste Forel and Iwan Block. At one gulp I\r\nswallowed Havelock Ellis’ _Psychology of Sex_, and had psychic\r\nindigestion for months thereafter. I was not shocked, but this\r\nmountainous array of abnormalities made me spiritually ill. So many\r\nvolumes were devoted to the exceptional, and so few to the\r\nmaladjustments of normal married people, which were infinitely more\r\nnumerous and urgent.\r\n\r\nI read translations from the German in which women were advised to have\r\nmore children because it could be proved statistically that their\r\ncondition was improved by childbearing. The only article on the question\r\nI could discover in American literature was in the _Atlantic Monthly_ by\r\nEdward Alsworth Ross of the University of Wisconsin, who brought to the\r\nattention of his readers the decline of the birth rate among the upper\r\nand educated classes and the increase among the unfit, the consequences\r\nof which were sure to be race suicide.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, Thomas Robert Malthus, remained little more than a name\r\nto me, something like Plato or Henry George. Father had talked about\r\nhim, but he meant mostly agriculture—wheat and food supplies in the\r\nnational sense. Possibly he had a philosophy but not, to me, a live one.\r\nHe had been put away on a shelf and, in my mind, had nothing to do with\r\nthe everyday human problem. I was not looking for theories. What I\r\ndesired was merely a simple method of contraception for the poor.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of my quest took me away from home a good deal. The children\r\nused to come in after school and at once hunt for me. “Where’s mother?”\r\nwas the usual question. If they found me at my mending basket they all\r\nleaped about for joy, took hands and danced, shouting, “Mother’s home,\r\nmother’s home, mother’s sewing.” Sewing seemed to imply a measure of\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nI, too, wanted to drive away the foreboding barrier of separation by\r\ncloser contact with them. I wanted to have them solely to myself, to\r\nfeed, to bathe, to clothe them myself. I had heard of the clean,\r\nwind-swept Cape Cod dunes, which appeared to be as far from the ugliness\r\nof civilization as I could get. Socialism, anarchism, syndicalism,\r\nprogressivism—I was tired of them all. At the end of the spring,\r\nthoroughly depressed and dissatisfied, I tucked the children under my\r\narms, boarded a Fall River boat, and sailed off, a pioneer to\r\nProvincetown.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the tip of the Cape was nothing but a fishing village with one\r\nplanked walk which, I was told, had been paid for by Congress. Up and\r\ndown its length the bellman, the last of the town criers, walked,\r\nproclaiming the news.\r\n\r\nAt first we lived in the upper story of a fisherman’s house right on the\r\nwater. After he went out in the morning, his wife and her children, and\r\nI and mine, were left alone. Then the old women recalled scenes from\r\ntheir early days on the whaling vessels. Their mothers had brought them\r\nforth unaided, and their own sons, in turn, had been born on the ships\r\nand apprenticed to their husbands. They fitted into life simply, but the\r\nyounger Portuguese, who were taking over the fishing industry, were\r\nasking what they should do about limiting their families.\r\n\r\nThe village was rather messy and smelled of fish. I was still too close\r\nto humanity and wanted to be more alone, so we moved to the extreme end\r\nof town. Our veranda faced the Bay, and when the tide was high the water\r\ncame up and lapped at the piles on which the cottage was built. Stuart,\r\nGrant, and Peggy used to sit on the steps and dabble their toes. At low\r\ntide they had two miles of beach on which to skip and run; it was a\r\nwonderful place to play, and all summer we had sunrise breakfasts,\r\nsunset picnics.\r\n\r\nEthel, who had married Jack Byrne, was now widowed and had also gone\r\ninto nursing. She had considerable free time and stayed with me.\r\nConsequently, I was able to leave the children in her care when I made\r\nmy expeditions to Boston’s far-famed public library, taking the _Dorothy\r\nBradford_ at noon, and coming back the next day. Even there I found no\r\ninformation more reliable than that exchanged by back-fence gossips in\r\nany small town.\r\n\r\nI spent the entire season at Provincetown, groping for knowledge,\r\nclassifying all my past activities in their proper categories, weighing\r\nthe pros and cons of what good there was in them and also what they\r\nlacked. It was a period of gestation. Just as you give birth to a child,\r\nso you can give birth to an idea.\r\n\r\nBetween interims of brooding and playing with the children I took part\r\nin the diversions of the minute colony of congenial people. Charles\r\nHawthorne had a school of painting, and Mary Heaton Vorse with her\r\nhusband, Joseph O’Brien, were there; so also were Hutch Hapgood and\r\nNeith Boyce. Jessie Ashley had lifted Big Bill Haywood out of the slough\r\nof the Paterson strike and brought him down to rest and recuperate.\r\n\r\nBig Bill was one of the few who saw what I was aiming at, although\r\nfearful that my future might involve the happiness of my children. Even\r\nhe did not feel that the small-family question was significant enough to\r\nbe injected into the labor platform. Nevertheless, as we rambled up and\r\ndown the beach he came to my aid with that cheering encouragement of\r\nwhich I was so sorely in need. He never wasted words in advising me to\r\n“wait.” Instead, he suggested that I go to France and see for myself the\r\nconditions resulting from generations of family limitation in that\r\ncountry. This struck me as a splendid idea, because it would also give\r\nBill Sanger a chance to paint instead of continuing to build suburban\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe trip to Europe seemed so urgent that no matter what sacrifices had\r\nto be made, we decided to make them when we came to them. In the fall we\r\nsold the house at Hastings, gave away some of our furniture and put the\r\nrest in storage. Although we did not realize it at the time, our\r\ngestures indicated a clean sweep of the past.\r\n\r\nAnita Block proposed that we go via Scotland; she wanted me to write\r\nthree or four articles on what twenty-five years of municipal ownership\r\nin Glasgow had done for women and children. Socialists were talking\r\nabout how everything there belonged to the people themselves and had\r\nearned their own way—banks, schools, homes, parks, markets, art\r\ngalleries, museums, laundries, bath houses, hospitals, and tramways. The\r\ncity was about to pay off the last debt on the transportation system,\r\nand this was being hailed as a great victory, a perfect example of what\r\nSocialism could do. It sounded big and fine, and I, too, was impressed.\r\nCertainly in Glasgow, I thought, I should find women walking hand in\r\nhand with men, and children free and happy.\r\n\r\nIn October the Sangers sailed from Boston on a cabin boat, little and\r\ncrowded, and one black night two weeks later steamed up the Clyde. The\r\nnaval program of 1913 was causing every shipyard to run double shifts,\r\nand the flare and glare against the somber dark was like\r\nfairyland—giant, sparkling starlights reaching from the horizon into the\r\nsky, a beautiful introduction to Utopia.\r\n\r\nThe very next day I started out upon my investigations. To mind the\r\nchildren, aged nine, five, and three, I availed myself of a sort of\r\nemployment bureau run by the Municipal Corporation. I had been told that\r\nanyone could call here for any imaginable type of service. In response\r\nto my summons, there promptly arrived at my door, standing straight and\r\nmachine-like, a small boy in a buttons uniform, with chin strap holding\r\nhis cap on the side of his head. Willie MacGuire’s stipend was to be\r\ntwelve cents an hour, or fifty cents for the half day. His function was\r\nto take the three out, entertain them, and return them faithfully at any\r\ntime designated. Though he was no bigger than Stuart, his efficient\r\nmanner reassured me, and I soon learned that he performed his duties\r\ndiligently.\r\n\r\nReligiously I made the rounds of all the social institutions, and at\r\nfirst everything appeared as I had been led to expect—except the\r\nweather. It had always just rained, and, when the sun did show itself,\r\nit was seldom for long enough to dry up the walks. Though the streets\r\nwere clean, they were invariably wet and damp, and nobody wore rubbers.\r\nEverywhere could be seen little girls down on their knees, scrubbing the\r\ndoor-steps in front of the houses, or, again, carrying huge bundles or\r\nbaskets of groceries to be delivered at the homes of the buyers. The\r\npeople themselves seemed cold and rigid, as dismal as their climate.\r\nOnly the policemen had a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nAs I proceeded, flaws in the vaunted civic enterprises began to display\r\nthemselves. Glasgow had its show beauty spots, but even the model\r\ntenements were not so good as our simplest, lower-middle-class apartment\r\nbuildings. One had been constructed for the accommodation of “deserving\r\nand respectable widows and widowers belonging to the working class”\r\nhaving one or more children with no one to care for them while the\r\nparents were away. But the building had been turned over to the\r\nexclusive use of widowers. Widows and their children had to shift for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAll tenements were planned scientifically on the basis of so many cubic\r\nfeet of air and so much light per so many human beings, ranging from\r\nquarters for two to those for five. No overcrowding was allowed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I asked, “what happens when there are five or six children?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they can’t live here,” replied the superintendent. “They must go\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“But where?”\r\n\r\nConversation ceased.\r\n\r\nWith particular attention I traced the adventures of one family which\r\nhad expanded beyond the three-child limit. The parents had first moved\r\nover to the fringes of the city, and thereafter as more children were\r\nborn had traveled from place to place, progressively more dingy, more\r\ndecrepit. They now had nine and were inhabiting a hovel in the\r\nshipbuilding slums, unimaginably filthy and too far from the splendid\r\nutilities ever to enjoy them.\r\n\r\nThe further I looked, the greater grew the inconsistency. The model\r\nmarkets carried chiefly wholesale produce, and the really poor, who were\r\nobliged to huddle on the far side of the city, contented themselves with\r\nbread and tea and were thankful to have it. Another disappointment was\r\nthe washhouses, dating from 1878 when they had been deemed a public\r\nnecessity because men had protested they were being driven from their\r\nhomes by washing which, on account of the incessant rain, seemed to hang\r\nthere forever. A stall cost only twopence an hour, less expensive than\r\nheating water at home, and there were always women waiting in line. But\r\nthe tram system, which was on the point of being liquidated in spite of\r\nits low fares, forbade laundry baskets, and, consequently, those who\r\nwere not within walking distance—and they were the ones who needed it\r\nmost—were deprived of its use.\r\n\r\nThroughout the slum section I saw drunken, sodden women whose remaining,\r\nsnag-like teeth stuck down like fangs and protruded from their sunken\r\nmouths. When I asked one of the executive officers of the corporation\r\nwhy they were so much more degraded than the men, he replied, “Oh, the\r\nwomen of Glasgow are all dirty and low. They’re hopeless.”\r\n\r\n“But why should this be?” I persisted.\r\n\r\nHis only answer was, “It’s their own fault.”\r\n\r\nBill and I walked about late at night, overwhelmed by the unspeakable\r\npoverty. The streets were filled with fighting, shiftless beggars.\r\nHundreds of women were abroad, the big shawls over their heads serving\r\ntwo purposes: one, to keep their shoulders warm; the other, to wrap\r\naround the baby which each one carried. It was apparent that their\r\nclothing consisted only of a shawl, a petticoat, a wrapper, and shoes.\r\nOlder children were begging, “A ha’penny for bread, Missus, a ha’penny\r\nfor bread.”\r\n\r\nIt was infinitely cold, dreary, and disappointing—so much talk about\r\nmore wages and better subsistence, and here the workers had it and what\r\nwere they getting?—a little more light, perhaps, a few more pennies a\r\nday, the opportunity to buy food a little more cheaply, a few parks in\r\nwhich they could wander, a bank where their money earned a fraction more\r\ninterest. But as soon as they passed beyond the border of another baby,\r\nthey were in exactly the same condition as the people beyond the realm\r\nof municipal control.\r\n\r\nMunicipal ownership was one more thing to throw in the discard.\r\n\r\nOne dull, rainy day, glad to leave behind the shrill, crying voices of\r\nthe beggars of Glasgow, we boarded a horrid cattle boat bound for\r\nAntwerp. The children were all seasick as we bounced and tossed over the\r\nNorth Sea. It was something of a job to handle the three of them with no\r\nnurse, especially when the storm threw them out of their beds on to the\r\ncabin floor. Fortunately they suffered no fractures, although twenty-six\r\nhorses in the hold had to be shot because their legs had been broken.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris at the end of another dismal,\r\nbewildering day—toot-toot! steam, luggage, brusque snatching by\r\nblue-smocked, black-capped porters, all looking like villains, jam at\r\nthe ticket gate, rackety taxi to a hotel on the Left Bank.\r\n\r\nParis seemed another Glasgow, more like a provincial village than a\r\ngreat metropolis. The atmosphere of petty penury destroyed my dreams of\r\nParisian gaiety and elegance; even the French children were dressed in\r\ndrab, gloomy, black aprons. Within a few days we had sub-let an\r\napartment on the Boulevard St. Michel across from the Luxembourg Gardens\r\nwhere Grant and Peggy could play. It was four flights up, and the cold\r\npenetrated to the marrow of our bones. We could put tons of briquets\r\ninto the little fireplaces and never get any heat. All the family went\r\ninto flannel underwear, the first since my early childhood.\r\n\r\nI presented Stuart to the superintendent of the district _lycée_. He\r\ndemanded a birth certificate, and I had none.\r\n\r\n“But without it how can I tell where he was born or how old he is?” The\r\nofficial seemed to imply that Stuart did not exist.\r\n\r\n“But,” I protested, “here he is. He’s alive.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Madame! The law says you must have a birth certificate.”\r\n\r\nI had to send him to a private school, which was something of a drain on\r\nthe budget.\r\n\r\nBill found a studio on Montparnasse, just back of the Station. Again and\r\nagain he came home aglow with news of meeting the great Matisse and\r\nother revolutionary painters barely emerging from obscurity. I trailed\r\naround to studios and exhibits occasionally, but I was trying to become\r\narticulate on my own subject, and paid scant attention to those who\r\nloomed up later as giants in the artistic world. The companionship of\r\nJessie Ashley and Bill Haywood, who had just come to Paris, was more\r\nfamiliar to me.\r\n\r\nI was also eager to encounter French people and discover their points of\r\nview. One of the first was Victor Dave, the last surviving leader of the\r\nFrench Commune of 1871. Thanksgiving Day we had a little dinner party\r\nand invited American friends to greet him. He was then over eighty, but\r\nstill keen and active. As the evening wore on we started him talking\r\nabout his past experiences and he held us enthralled until way into the\r\nmorning, when we all had breakfast in the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe old Communard spoke English far better than any of us spoke French.\r\nHe was now making three dollars a week by his linguistic abilities,\r\nbecause he was the sole person the Government could call upon not only\r\nfor the language but the dialects of the Balkans. Just the day before he\r\nhad been translating a new series of treaties which France was making\r\nwith the Balkan States in a desperate attempt to tie them to the Triple\r\nEntente. Though he was a philosophical person who could be gay over his\r\nown hardships, his confidences to us were serious and sad. From the\r\nagreements then being drawn up, particularly those with Rumania, he\r\ncould see nothing but war ahead, predicting definitely that within five\r\nyears all nations would be at each other’s throats. We newcomers to\r\nEurope could not grasp the meaning of his words, and the residents\r\nshrugged their shoulders and said, “He is getting old. He cannot see\r\nthat we are now beyond war, that people are too intelligent ever to\r\nresort to it again.”\r\n\r\nAs I look back it is apparent that we heard in France the whole\r\nrumblings of the World War. Unrest was in the air as it had been in the\r\nUnited States, but with a difference. Theaters were showing anti-German\r\nplays, _revanche_ placards decorated Napoleon’s tomb in the Invalides,\r\nand the rusty black draperies around the shrouded statue of Strasbourg\r\nin the Place de la Concorde pointed a macabre note. These were\r\nremembered afterwards; at the time they were merely part of the Paris\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nI realized the disadvantage of not being better acquainted with the\r\nFrench language, and started in to practice what I knew and learn more.\r\nGood fortune brought me in touch with an Englishwoman, the wife of the\r\neditor of _L’Humanité_, the organ of the Confédération Générale de\r\nTravail, the famous C.G.T. To her I clung and at her home I met the\r\nSocialist leader, Jean Jaurès. His English was bad and my French worse;\r\nwe had to have an interpreter. Doubtless we missed a lot, but even so we\r\nfound we understood each other. I believe that his assassination on the\r\neve of the war which he had done so much to prevent proved an\r\nirreparable loss to the cause of peace.\r\n\r\nIn my language difficulties Jessie Ashley’s fluency was an ever-present\r\nhelp. Together we used to eat in the restaurants frequented by laborers,\r\nwho came in groups, keeping their caps on, enjoying the cheap and good\r\nfood accompanied by wine. Often we were the only women in the place,\r\nalways excepting the inevitable cashier.\r\n\r\nThough women were rarely seen at a C.G.T. meeting, Victor Dave took\r\nJessie and me to a particularly impressive one which Bill Haywood was to\r\naddress. His reputation as a firebrand had preceded him, and the police\r\nwere making certain that no riot should ensue; they were stopping each\r\nperson who crossed the bridge and demanding an account of his\r\ndestination. Our passport was the venerable appearance of our escort,\r\nwhose long white hair hung low about his head. His top hat, that\r\nuniversal badge of respectability, let us through.\r\n\r\nThe vast auditorium was filled with some three thousand French\r\nsyndicalists, similar to the American I.W.W.’s, all standing, all\r\nwearing the uniform of the proletariat—black-visored caps and loose\r\ncorduroys. They were being urged not to take up arms against the workers\r\nof other nations. I began to wonder whether perhaps the various tokens\r\nof disquiet which had impalpably surrounded me since coming to France\r\nhad some more desperate meaning than we in America had realized. The\r\n_War, What For?_ discussions in New York had seemed only a part of the\r\nevening conversations. Here again I was listening to protests against\r\ngovernment efforts to arouse national hatred by calling it patriotism. I\r\nhad heard the words so often, “Workers of the World, Unite,” yet at last\r\nI was vaguely uneasy because of the difference in spirit.\r\n\r\nAs we emerged into the narrow, alley-like street we found the exits into\r\nthe boulevard guarded by hundreds of gendarmes, both mounted and afoot.\r\nHad any outbreak occurred, the assembled syndicalists would literally\r\nhave been trapped.\r\n\r\nMy uneasiness was increased as a result of a visit to the Hindu\r\nnationalist, Shyamaji Krishnavarma. In England he had been an agitator\r\nfor Indian Home Rule and, when the London residence of the Viceroy of\r\nIndia had been bombed, with other Indians who might have been\r\nimplicated, he had fled to France, so long the sanctuary for anyone who,\r\nbecause of political beliefs, got into trouble elsewhere. Krishnavarma\r\nwas now editing the _Indian Sociologist_, which was being secretly\r\nspirited across the Channel.\r\n\r\nKrishnavarma had asked whether he might be permitted to give a reception\r\nin my honor. No Hindu had ever given a reception in my honor. Trying to\r\nappear, however, as though this were a frequent occurrence, I set a time\r\nand bravely entered his salon, supported, as usual, by Jessie.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five men were there, Indian students all, and only one\r\nother woman, Mrs. Krishnavarma, barely out of purdah and still in native\r\ndress. As a great concession she had been allowed to come in, despite\r\nthe presence of men. It was evident she could listen but not speak,\r\nbecause, when I asked her something about her children, Krishnavarma\r\nanswered for her quickly. A little later I was disputing a point with\r\nhim and, to bolster up his argument, he gave her a curt command in\r\nHindustani. She rose swiftly and soon returned with a well-thumbed and\r\npencil-marked copy of Spencer. I had come to consider Spencer’s\r\nphilosophy old-fogyish. His teachings were so mild that I wondered what\r\nin the world he could ever have been hounded for. Though Krishnavarma\r\nwas working towards the freedom of India he had gone no further than\r\nthis pink tea which was not even pale China, let alone sturdy, black\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nI had been home scarcely more than half an hour and was dressing for\r\ndinner when Peggy ran in animatedly. “Mother, there are three soldiers\r\nat the door!” The bright uniforms of the gendarmes had taken her fancy,\r\nand she was pleased and excited. When I went out to meet them they\r\ndemanded to know where we had come from, the object of our visit to\r\nFrance, how long we intended to stay, in what manner we had located the\r\napartment, from whom we had rented it, where I had been that afternoon,\r\nthe length of time I had known Krishnavarma, and the reason for my being\r\nat his home. Finally, they explained their presence by saying the\r\nconcierge had not sent in the required information to the prefecture.\r\n\r\nWhen I described the strange visitation to someone familiar with French\r\ncustoms, I was told that concierges were all ex officio agents of the\r\npolice and were compelled to make regular reports of the activities, no\r\nmatter how petty, of their tenants. These were incorporated into the\r\ndossiers of all foreigners. Actually, the police, working with the\r\nBritish Secret Service, were checking up on Krishnavarma’s callers.\r\nThereafter gendarmes lingered in doorways outside our apartment, and\r\nwherever I went I was conscious they were in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nBecause of the predilection of the French for quality rather than\r\nquantity, they had not only adopted the sociological definition of\r\nproletariat, “the prolific ones,” a term originally applied by the\r\nRomans to the lowest class of society, but had interpreted it literally.\r\nThe syndicalists in particular had made what they called conscious\r\ngeneration a part of their policy and principles, and had affiliated\r\nthemselves with the Neo-Malthusian movement, which had its headquarters\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nThe parents of France, almost on the same wage scale as those I had seen\r\nin Glasgow, had settled the matter to their own satisfaction. Their one\r\nor two children were given all the care and advantages of French\r\nculture. I was struck with the motherly attention bestowed by our _femme\r\nde chambre_ upon her only child. She came promptly to work, but nothing\r\ncould persuade her to arrive before Jean had been taken to his school,\r\nand nothing could prevent her leaving promptly at noon to fetch him for\r\nhis luncheon.\r\n\r\nWhen Bill Haywood began taking me into the homes of the syndicalists, I\r\nfound perfect acceptance of family limitation and its relation to labor.\r\n“Have you just discovered this?” I asked each woman I met.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, _Maman_ told me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, who told her?”\r\n\r\n“_Grandmère_, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nThe _Code Napoléon_ had provided that daughters should inherit equally\r\nwith sons and this, to the thrifty peasant mind, had indicated the\r\ndesirability of fewer offspring. Nobody would marry a girl unless she\r\nhad been instructed how to regulate the numbers of her household as well\r\nas the home itself.\r\n\r\nSome of the contraceptive formulas which had been handed down were\r\nalmost as good as those of today. Although they had to make simple\r\nthings, mothers prided themselves on their special recipes for\r\nsuppositories as much as on those for _pot au feu_ or wine.\r\n\r\nAll individual Frenchwomen considered this knowledge their individual\r\nright, and, if it failed, abortion, which was still common. I talked\r\nabout the problems of my own people, but they could give me no help,\r\nmerely shrugging their shoulders, apparently glad they were living in\r\nFrance and not in the United States. This independence of thought and\r\naction seemed wholly admirable to me at the time, and I sang the praises\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nBill was happy in his studio, but I could find no peace. Each day I\r\nstayed, each person I met, made it worse. A whole year had been given\r\nover to this inactive, incoherent brooding. Family and friends had been\r\ngenerous in patience. I had added to my personal experience statistics\r\nfrom Glasgow and the little formulas I had gathered from the French\r\npeasants. With this background I had practically reached the exploding\r\npoint. I could not contain my ideas, I wanted to get on with what I had\r\nto do in the world.\r\n\r\nThe last day of the year, December 31, 1913, Bill and I said good-by,\r\nunaware the parting was to be final. With the children I embarked at\r\nCherbourg for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Nine_\r\n\r\n                            THE WOMAN REBEL\r\n\r\n     “_Oh you daughters of the West!\r\n     O you young and elder daughters! O you maidens and you women!\r\n     Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,\r\n                     Pioneers! O pioneers!_”\r\n                                         WALT WHITMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _New York_ was a nice ship and it was not too wintry to walk about\r\non deck. After the children were safely in bed I paced round and round\r\nand absorbed into my being that quiet which comes to you at sea. That it\r\nwas New Year’s Eve added to the poignancy of my emotions but did not\r\nobscure the faith within.\r\n\r\nI knew something must be done to rescue those women who were voiceless;\r\nsomeone had to express with white hot intensity the conviction that they\r\nmust be empowered to decide for themselves when they should fulfill the\r\nsupreme function of motherhood. They had to be made aware of how they\r\nwere being shackled, and roused to mutiny. To this end I conceived the\r\nidea of a magazine to be called the _Woman Rebel_, dedicated to the\r\ninterests of working women.\r\n\r\nOften I had thought of Vashti as the first woman rebel in history. Once\r\nwhen her husband, King Ahasuerus, had been showing off to his people his\r\nfine linens, his pillars of marble, his beds of gold and silver, and all\r\nhis riches, he had commanded that his beautiful Queen Vashti also be put\r\non view. But she had declined to be exhibited as a possession or\r\nchattel. Because of her disobedience, which might set a very bad example\r\nto other wives, she had been cast aside and Ahasuerus had chosen a new\r\nbride, the meek and gentle Esther.\r\n\r\nI wanted each woman to be a rebellious Vashti, not an Esther; was she to\r\nbe merely a washboard with only one song, one song? Surely, she should\r\nbe allowed to develop all her potentialities. Feminists were trying to\r\nfree her from the new economic ideology but were doing nothing to free\r\nher from her biological subservience to man, which was the true cause of\r\nher enslavement.\r\n\r\nBefore gathering friends around me for that help which I must have in\r\nstirring women to sedition, before asking them to believe, I had to\r\nchart my own course. Should I bring the cause to the attention of the\r\npeople by headlines and front pages? Should I follow my own compulsion\r\nregardless of extreme consequences?\r\n\r\nI fully recognized I must refrain from acts which I could not carry\r\nthrough. So many movements had been issuing defiances without any\r\nultimate goal, shooting off a popgun here, a popgun there, and finally\r\nshooting themselves to death. They had been too greatly resembling\r\nfroth—too noisy with the screech of tin horns and other cheap\r\ninstruments instead of the deeper sounds of an outraged, angry, serious\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWith as crystal a view as that which had come to me after the death of\r\nMrs. Sachs when I had renounced nursing forever, I saw the path ahead in\r\nits civic, national, and even international direction—a panorama of\r\nthings to be. Fired with this vision, I went into the lounge and wrote\r\nand wrote page after page until the hours of daylight.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the principles, I left the details to work themselves\r\nout. I realized that a price must be paid for honest thinking—a price\r\nfor everything. Though I did not know exactly how I was to prepare\r\nmyself, what turn events might take, or what I might be called upon to\r\ndo, the future in its larger aspects has actually developed as I saw it\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nThe same thoughts kept repeating themselves over and over during the\r\nremainder of the otherwise uneventful voyage. As soon as possible after\r\nreaching New York, I rented an inexpensive little flat on Post Avenue\r\nnear Dyckman Street, so far out on the upper end of Manhattan that even\r\nthe Broadway subway trains managed to burrow their way into sunlight and\r\nfresh air. My dining room was my office, the table my desk.\r\n\r\nA new movement was starting, and the baby had to have a name. It did not\r\nbelong to Socialism nor was it in the labor field, and it had much more\r\nto it than just the prevention of conception. As a few companions were\r\nsitting with me one evening we debated in turn voluntary parenthood,\r\nvoluntary motherhood, the new motherhood, constructive generation, and\r\nnew generation. The terms already in use—Neo-Malthusianism, Family\r\nLimitation, and Conscious Generation seemed stuffy and lacked popular\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe word control was good, but I did not like limitation—that was too\r\nlimiting. I was not advocating a one-child or two-child system as in\r\nFrance, nor did I wholeheartedly agree with the English Neo-Malthusians\r\nwhose concern was almost entirely with limitation for economic reasons.\r\nMy idea of control was bigger and freer. I wanted family in it, yet\r\nfamily control did not sound right. We tried population control, race\r\ncontrol, and birth rate control. Then someone suggested, “Drop the\r\nrate.” Birth control was the answer; we knew we had it. Our work for\r\nthat day was done and everybody picked up his hat and went home. The\r\nbaby was named.\r\n\r\nWhen I first announced that I was going to publish a magazine, “Where\r\nare you going to get the money?” was volleyed at me from all sides. I\r\ndid not know, but I was certain of its coming somehow. Equally important\r\nwas moral support. Those same young friends and I founded a little\r\nsociety, grandly titled the National Birth Control League, sought aid\r\nfrom enthusiasts for other causes, turning first to the Feminists\r\nbecause they seemed our natural allies. Armed with leaflets we went to\r\nCooper Union to tell them that in the _Woman Rebel_ they would have an\r\nopportunity to express their sentiments.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, the Feminist leader, was trying to inspire\r\nwomen in this country to have a deeper meaning in their lives, which to\r\nher signified more than getting the vote. Nevertheless, at that time I\r\nstruck no responsive chord from her or from such intelligent co-workers\r\nas Crystal Eastman, Marie Howe, or Henrietta Rodman. It seemed\r\nunbelievable they could be serious in occupying themselves with what I\r\nregarded as trivialities when mothers within a stone’s throw of their\r\nmeetings were dying shocking deaths.\r\n\r\nWho cared whether a woman kept her Christian name—Mary Smith instead of\r\nMrs. John Jones? Who cared whether she wore her wedding ring? Who cared\r\nabout her demand for the right to work? Hundreds of thousands of\r\nlaundresses, cloak-makers, scrub women, servants, telephone girls, shop\r\nworkers would gladly have changed places with the Feminists in return\r\nfor the right to have leisure, to be lazy a little now and then. When I\r\nsuggested that the basis of Feminism might be the right to be a mother\r\nregardless of church or state, their inherited prejudices were instantly\r\naroused. They were still subject to the age-old, masculine atmosphere\r\ncompounded of protection and dominance.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in that quarter I turned to the Socialists and trade\r\nunionists, trusting they would appreciate the importance of family\r\nlimitation in the kind of civilization towards which they were\r\nstumbling. Notices were sent to _The Masses_, _Mother Earth_, _The\r\nCall_, _The Arm and Hammer_, _The Liberator_, all names echoing the\r\nspirit which had quickened them.\r\n\r\nShortly I had several hundred subscriptions to the _Woman Rebel_, paid\r\nup in advance at the rate of a dollar a year, the period for which I had\r\nmade my plans. Proceeds were to go into a separate revolving account,\r\nscrupulously kept. Unlike so many ephemeral periodicals, mine was not to\r\nflare up and spark out before it had functioned, leaving its subscribers\r\nwith only a few issues when they were entitled to more. Eventually we\r\nhad a mailing list of about two thousand, but five, ten, even fifty\r\ncopies often went in a bundle to be distributed without charge to some\r\nlabor organization.\r\n\r\nI was solely responsible for the magazine financially, legally, and\r\nmorally; I was editor, manager, circulation department, bookkeeper, and\r\nI paid the printer’s bill. But any cause that has not helpers is losing\r\nout. So many men and women secretaries, stenographers, clerks, used to\r\ncome in of an evening that I could not find room for all. Some typed,\r\nsome addressed envelopes, some went to libraries and looked up things\r\nfor us to use, some wrote articles, though seldom signing their own\r\nnames. Not one penny ever had to go for salaries, because service was\r\ngiven freely.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1914, appeared the first issue of the _Woman Rebel_, eight\r\npages on cheap paper, copied from the French style, mailed first class\r\nin the city and expressed outside. My initial declaration of the right\r\nof the individual was the slogan “No Gods, No Masters.” Gods, not God. I\r\nwanted that word to go beyond religion and also stop turning idols,\r\nheroes, leaders into gods.\r\n\r\nI defined a woman’s duty, “To look the world in the face with a\r\ngo-to-hell look in the eyes; to have an idea; to speak and act in\r\ndefiance of convention.” It was a marvelous time to say what we wished.\r\nAll America was a Hyde Park corner as far as criticism and challenging\r\nthought were concerned. We advocated direct action and took up the\r\nburning questions of the day. With a fine sense of irony we put\r\nanti-capitalist soapbox oratory in print. I do not know whether the\r\nfinanciers we denounced would have been tolerant or resentful of our\r\nonslaughts had they read them, or as full of passion for their cause as\r\nwe for ours. Perhaps they too will have forgotten that emotion now.\r\n\r\nMy daily routine always started with looking over the pile of mail, and\r\none morning my attention was caught by an unstamped official envelope\r\nfrom the New York Post Office. I tore it open.\r\n\r\n  Dear Madam, You are hereby notified that the Solicitor of the Post\r\n  Office Department has decided that the _Woman Rebel_ for March,\r\n  1914, is unmailable under Section 489, Postal Laws and Regulations.\r\n\r\n                                             E. M. Morgan, Postmaster.\r\n\r\nI reread the letter. It was so unexpected that at first the significance\r\ndid not sink in. I had given no contraceptive information; I had merely\r\nannounced that I intended to do so. Then I began to realize that no\r\nmention was made of any special article or articles. I wrote Mr. Morgan\r\nand asked him to state what specifically had offended, thereby assisting\r\nme in my future course. His reply simply repeated that the March issue\r\nwas unmailable.\r\n\r\nI had anticipated objections from religious bodies, but believed with\r\nfather, “Anything you want can be accomplished by putting a little piece\r\nof paper into the ballot box.” Therefore, to have our insignificant\r\nmagazine stopped by the big, strong United States Government seemed so\r\nludicrous as almost to make us feel important.\r\n\r\nTo the newspaper world this was news, but not one of the dailies picked\r\nit out as an infringement of a free press. The _Sun_ carried a headline,\r\n“‘WOMAN REBEL’ BARRED FROM MAILS.” And underneath the comment, “Too bad.\r\nThe case should be reversed. They should be barred from her and spelled\r\ndifferently.”\r\n\r\nMany times I studied Section 211 of the Federal Statutes, under which\r\nthe Post Office was acting. This penal clause of the Comstock Law had\r\nbeen left hanging in Washington like the dried shell of a tortoise. Its\r\ngrip had even been tightened on the moral side; in case the word obscene\r\nshould prove too vague, its definition had been enlarged to include the\r\nprevention of conception and the causing of abortion under one and the\r\nsame heading. To me it was outrageous that information regarding\r\nmotherhood, which was so generally called sacred, should be classed with\r\npornography.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I had not broken the law, because it did not prohibit\r\ndiscussion of contraception—merely giving advice. I harbored a burning\r\ndesire to undermine that law. But if I continued publication I was\r\nmaking myself liable to a Federal indictment and a possible prison term\r\nof five years plus a fine of five thousand dollars. I had to choose\r\nbetween abandoning the _Woman Rebel_, changing its tone, or continuing\r\nas I had begun. Though I had no wish to become a martyr, with no\r\nhesitation I followed the last-named course.\r\n\r\nI gathered our little group together. At first we assumed Comstock had\r\nstopped the entire issue before delivery, but apparently he had not,\r\nbecause only the A to M’s which had been mailed in the local post office\r\nhad been confiscated. We took a fresh lot downtown, slipped three into\r\none chute, four in another, walked miles around the city so that no\r\nsingle box contained more than a few copies.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure had to be pursued in succeeding months. Sometimes\r\ndaylight caught me, with one or more assistants, still tramping from the\r\nprinter’s and dropping the copies, piece by piece, into various boxes\r\nand chutes. I felt the Government was absurd and tyrannical to make us\r\ndo this for no good purpose. I could not get used to its methods then. I\r\nhave not yet, and probably never shall.\r\n\r\nThe _Woman Rebel_ produced extraordinary results, striking vibrations\r\nthat brought contacts, messages, inquiries, pamphlets, books, even some\r\nmoney. I corresponded with the leading Feminists of Europe—Ellen Key,\r\nthen at the height of her fame, Olive Schreiner, Mrs. Pankhurst, Rosa\r\nLuxemburg, Adele Schreiber, Clara Zetkin, Roszika Schwimmer, Frau Maria\r\nStritt. But I also heard from sources and groups I had hardly known\r\nexisted—Theosophist, New Thought, Rosicrucian, Spiritualist, Mental\r\nScientist. It was not alone from New York, but from the highways and by\r\nways of north, south, east, and west that inspiration came.\r\n\r\nAfter the second number the focus had been birth control. Within six\r\nmonths we had received over ten thousand letters, arriving in\r\naccelerating volume. Most of them read, “Will your magazine give\r\naccurate and reliable information to prevent conception?” This I could\r\nnot print. Realizing by now it was going to be a fairly big fight, I was\r\ncareful not to break the law on such a trivial point. It would have been\r\nridiculous to have a single letter reach the wrong destination;\r\ntherefore, I sent no contraceptive facts through the mails.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had no intention of giving up this primary purpose. I began\r\nsorting and arranging the material I had brought back from France,\r\ncomplete with formulas and drawings, to be issued in a pamphlet where I\r\ncould treat the subject with more delicacy than in a magazine, writing\r\nit for women of extremely circumscribed vocabularies. A few hundred\r\ndollars were needed to finance publication of _Family Limitation_, as I\r\nnamed it, and I approached Theodore Schroeder, a lawyer of standing and\r\nan ardent advocate of free speech. He had been left a fund by a certain\r\nDr. Foote who had produced a book on _Borning Better Babies_, and I\r\nthought my pamphlet might qualify as a beneficiary.\r\n\r\nDr. Abraham Brill was just then bringing out a translation of Freud, in\r\nwhom Schroeder was much interested. He asked whether I had been\r\npsychoanalyzed.\r\n\r\n“What is psychoanalysis?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me critically as from a great height. “You ought to be\r\nanalyzed as to your motives. If, after six weeks, you still wish to\r\npublish this pamphlet, I’ll pay for ten thousand copies.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you think I won’t want to go on?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t only think so. I’m quite sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then I won’t be analyzed.”\r\n\r\nI took the manuscript to a printer well known for his liberal tendencies\r\nand courage. He read the contents page by page and said, “You’ll never\r\nget this set up in any shop in New York. It’s a Sing Sing job.”\r\n\r\nEvery one of the twenty printers whom I tried to persuade was afraid to\r\ntouch it. It was impossible ever, it seemed, to get into print the\r\ncontents of that pamphlet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, following the March issue the May and July numbers of the\r\n_Woman Rebel_ had also been banned. In reply to each of the formal\r\nnotices I inquired which particular article or articles had incurred\r\ndisapproval, but could obtain no answer.\r\n\r\nAt that time I visualized the birth control movement as part of the\r\nfight for freedom of speech. How much would the postal authorities\r\nsuppress? What were they really after? I was determined to prod and goad\r\nuntil some definite knowledge was obtained as to what was “obscene,\r\nlewd, and lascivious.”\r\n\r\nTheodore Schroeder and I used to meet once in a while at the Liberal\r\nClub, and he gave much sound advice—I could not go on with the _Woman\r\nRebel_ forever. Eventually the Post Office would wear me down by\r\nstopping the issues as fast as I printed them. He warned, “They won’t do\r\nso and so unless you do thus and thus. If you do such and such, then\r\nyou’ll have to take the consequences.” He was a good lawyer and an\r\nauthority on the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen my family learned that I might be getting in deep water a council\r\nwas called just as when I had been a child. A verdict of nervous\r\nbreakdown was openly decreed, but back in the minds of all was the\r\nunspoken dread that I must have become mentally unbalanced. They\r\ninsisted father come to New York, where he had not been for forty years,\r\nto persuade me to go to a sanitarium.\r\n\r\nFor several days father and I talked over the contents of the _Woman\r\nRebel_. In his fine, flowing language he expressed his hatred of it. He\r\ndespised talk about revolution, and despaired of anyone who could\r\ndiscuss sex, blaming this on my nursing training, which, he intimated,\r\nhad put me in possession of all the known secrets of the human body. He\r\nwas not quite sure what birth control was, and my reasoning, which\r\nretraced the pattern of our old arguments, made no impression upon him.\r\n\r\nFather would have nothing to do with the “queer people” who came to the\r\nhouse—people of whom no one had ever heard—turning up with articles on\r\nevery possible subject and defying me to publish them in the name of\r\nfree speech. I printed everything. For the August issue I accepted a\r\nphilosophical essay on the theory of assassination, largely derived from\r\nRichard Carlile. It was vague, inane, and innocuous, and had no bearing\r\non my policy except to taunt the Government to take action, because\r\nassassination also was included under Section 211.\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks earlier, the war which Victor Dave had predicted had\r\nstarted its headlong progress. The very moment when most people were\r\nbusy with geographies and atlases, trying to find out just where\r\nSarajevo might be, the United States chose to sever diplomatic relations\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nOne morning I was startled by the peremptory, imperious, and incessant\r\nringing of my bell. When I opened the door, I was confronted by two\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Will you come in?”\r\n\r\nThey followed me into my living room, scrutinized with amazement the\r\nvelocipede and wagon, the woolly animals and toys stacked in the corner.\r\nOne of them asked, “Are you the editor and publisher of a magazine\r\nentitled the _Woman Rebel_?”\r\n\r\nWhen I confessed to it, he thrust a legal document into my hands. I\r\ntried to read it, threading my way slowly through the jungle of legal\r\nterminology. Perhaps the words became a bit blurred because of the\r\nslight trembling of my hands, but I managed to disentangle the crucial\r\npoint of the message. I had been indicted—indicted on no less than nine\r\ncounts—for alleged violation of the Federal Statutes. If found guilty on\r\nall, I might be liable to forty-five years in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nI looked at the two agents of the Department of Justice. They seemed\r\nnice and sensible. I invited them to sit down and started in to explain\r\nbirth control. For three hours I presented to their imaginations some of\r\nthe tragic stories of conscript motherhood. I forget now what I said,\r\nbut at the end they agreed that such a law should not be on the statute\r\nbooks. Yet it was, and there was nothing to do about it but bring my\r\ncase to court.\r\n\r\nWhen the officers had gone, father came through the door of the\r\nadjoining room where he had been reading the paper. He put both arms\r\naround me and said, “Your mother would have been alive today if we had\r\nknown all this then.” He had applied my recital directly to his own\r\nlife. “You will win this case. Everything is with you—logic, common\r\nsense, and progress. I never saw the truth until this instant.”\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned phraseology, but father was at last convinced. He went\r\nhome quite proud, thinking I was not so crazy after all, and began\r\nsending me clippings to help prove the case for birth control—women who\r\nhad drowned themselves or their children and the brutalities of parents,\r\nbecause even mother love might turn cruel if too hard pressed.\r\n\r\nMy faith was still childlike. I trusted that, like father, a judge\r\nrepresenting our Government would be convinced. All I had to do was\r\nexplain to those in power what I was doing and everything would come\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAugust twenty-fifth I was arraigned in the old Post Office way downtown.\r\nJudge Hazel, himself a father of eight or nine children, was kindly, and\r\nI suspected the two Federal agents who had summoned me had spoken a good\r\nword on my behalf. But Assistant District Attorney Harold A. Content\r\nseemed a ferocious young fellow. When the Judge asked, “What sort of\r\nthings is Mrs. Sanger doing to violate the law?” he answered, “She’s\r\nprinting articles advocating bomb throwing and assassination.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Sanger doesn’t look like a bomb thrower or an assassin.”\r\n\r\nMr. Content murmured something about not all being gold that glittered;\r\nI was doing a great deal of harm. He intimated he knew of my attempts to\r\nget _Family Limitation_ in print when he said, “She is not satisfied\r\nmerely to violate the law, but is planning to do it on a very large\r\nscale.”\r\n\r\nJudge Hazel, apparently believing the charges much exaggerated, put the\r\ncase over until the fall term, which gave me six weeks to prepare my\r\nanswer, and Mr. Content concurred, saying that if this were not enough\r\ntime, I could have more.\r\n\r\nThe press also was inclined to be friendly. Reporters came up to Post\r\nAvenue, looked over the various articles. They agreed, “We think the\r\nGovernment absolutely wrong. We don’t see how it has any case.”\r\nUnfortunately, while we were talking, Peggy, who had never seen a derby\r\nbefore, took possession of their hats and sticks, and in the hall a\r\nlittle parade of children formed, marching up and down in front of the\r\ndoor. One of the gentlemen was so furious that I hid Peggy in the\r\nkitchen away from his wrath. As he went out he remarked, “You should\r\nhave birth controlled them before they were born. Why don’t you stay\r\nhome and spend some thought on disciplining your own family?”\r\n\r\nI had many things to do which could not be postponed, the most important\r\namong them being to provide for the children’s future. This occupied\r\nmuch of my time for the next few weeks. Temporarily, I sent the younger\r\ntwo to the Catskills and Stuart to a camp in Maine, arranging for school\r\nin the fall on Long Island.\r\n\r\nDefense funds were always being raised when radicals got into trouble to\r\npay pseudo-radical lawyers to fight the cases on technicalities. I was\r\nnot going to have any lawyer get me out of this. Since my indictment had\r\nnot stopped my publishing the _Woman Rebel_, through the columns of the\r\nSeptember issue I told my subscribers I did not want pennies or dollars,\r\nbut appealed to them to combine forces and protest on their own behalf\r\nagainst government invasion of their rights. That issue and the October\r\none were both suppressed.\r\n\r\nDuring what might be called my sleepwalking stage it was as though I\r\nwere heading towards a precipice and nothing could awaken me. I had no\r\near for the objections of family or the criticism of friends. People\r\nwere around me, I knew, but I could not see them clearly; I was deaf to\r\ntheir warnings and blind to their signs.\r\n\r\nWhen I review the situation through the eyes of those who gave me\r\ncircumspect advice, I can understand their attitude. I was considered a\r\nconservative, even a bourgeoise by the radicals. I was digging into an\r\nillegal subject, was not a trained writer or speaker or experienced in\r\nthe arts of the propagandist, had no money with which to start a rousing\r\ncampaign, and possessed neither social position nor influence.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of nearly all my acquaintances I would have to spend at\r\nleast a year in jail, and they began to condole with me. None offered to\r\ndo anything about it, just suggested how I could get through. One kind\r\nwoman whom I had never seen before called late one evening and\r\nvolunteered to give me dancing lessons. In a small six-by-four cabin she\r\nhad developed a system which she claimed was equally applicable to a\r\nprison cell and would keep me in good health. She even wrote out careful\r\ndirections for combining proper exercises with the rhythm of the dance.\r\n\r\nBut I myself had no intention of going to jail; it was not in my\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I had to do before my trial. _Family Limitation_ simply\r\nmust be published. I had at last found the right person—Bill Shatoff,\r\nRussian-born, big and burly, at that time a linotype operator on a\r\nforeign paper. So that nobody would see him he did the job after hours\r\nwhen his shop was supposed to be closed.\r\n\r\nAt first I had thought only of an edition of ten thousand. However, when\r\nI learned that union leaders in the silk, woolen, and copper industries\r\nwere eager to have many more copies to distribute, I enlarged my plan. I\r\nwould have liked to print a million but, owing to lack of funds, could\r\nnot manage more than a hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nAddressing the envelopes took a lot of work. Night after night the\r\nfaithful band labored in a storage room, wrapping, weighing, stamping.\r\nBundles went to the mills in the East, to the mines of the West—to\r\nChicago, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh, to Butte, Lawrence, and\r\nPaterson. All who had requested copies were to receive them\r\nsimultaneously; I did not want any to be circulated until I was ready,\r\nand refused to have one in my own house. I was a tyrant about this, as\r\nfirm as a general about leaving no rough edges.\r\n\r\nIn October my case came up. I had had no notice and, without a lawyer to\r\nkeep me posted, did not even know it had been called until the District\r\nAttorney’s office telephoned. Since Mr. Content had promised me plenty\r\nof time, I thought this was merely a formality and all I had to do was\r\nput in an appearance.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I presented myself at court. As I sat in the crowded\r\nroom I felt crushed and oppressed by an intuitive sense of the\r\ntremendous, impersonal power of my opponents. Popular interest was now\r\nfocused on Europe; my little defiance was no longer important. When I\r\nwas brought out of my reverie by the voice of the clerk trumpeting forth\r\nin the harshly mechanical tones of a train announcer something about\r\n_The People_ v. _Margaret Sanger_, there flashed into my mind a huge map\r\nof the United States, coming to life as a massive, vari-colored animal,\r\nagainst which I, so insignificant and small, must in some way defend\r\nmyself. It was a terrific feeling.\r\n\r\nBut courage did not entirely desert me. Elsie Clapp, whose ample Grecian\r\nfigure made her seem a tower of strength, marched up the aisle with me\r\nas though she, too, were to be tried. I said to Judge Hazel that I was\r\nnot prepared, and asked for a month’s adjournment. Mr. Content\r\nastonished me by objecting. “Mrs. Sanger’s had plenty of time and I see\r\nno reason, Your Honor, why we should have a further postponement. Every\r\nday’s delay means that her violations are increased. I ask that the case\r\ncontinue this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nA change in Judge Hazel’s attitude had taken place since August. Instead\r\nof listening to my request, he advised me to get an attorney at once—my\r\ntrial would go on after the noon recess.\r\n\r\nI was so amazed that I could only believe his refusal was due to my lack\r\nof technical knowledge, and supposed that at this point I really had to\r\nhave a lawyer. I knew Simon H. Pollock, who had represented labor during\r\nthe Paterson strike, and I went to see him. He agreed with me that a\r\nlawyer’s plea would not be rejected and that afternoon confidently asked\r\nfor a month’s stay. It was denied. He reduced it to two weeks. Again it\r\nwas denied. At ten the following morning the case was to be tried\r\nwithout fail.\r\n\r\nFrom the Post Office Department I received roundabout word that my\r\nconviction had already been decided upon. When I told this to Mr.\r\nPollock he said, “There isn’t a thing I can do. You’d better plead\r\nguilty and let us get you out as fast as we can. We might even be able\r\nto make some deal with the D.A. so you’d only have to pay a fine.”\r\n\r\nI indignantly refused to plead guilty under any circumstances. What was\r\nthe sense of bringing about my indictment in order to test the law, and\r\nthen admit that I had done wrong? I was trying to prove the law was\r\nwrong, not I. Giving Mr. Pollock no directions how to act, I merely said\r\nI would call him up.\r\n\r\nIt was now four o’clock and I sought refuge at home to think through my\r\nmental turmoil and distress. But home was crowded with too many\r\nassociations and emotions pulling me this way and that. When my thoughts\r\nwould not come clear and straight I packed a suitcase, went back\r\ndowntown, and took a room in a hotel, the most impersonal place in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt in my mind that if I faced the hostile court the next\r\nmorning, unprepared as I was, I would be convicted of publishing an\r\nobscene paper. Such a verdict would be an injustice. If I were to\r\nconvince a court of the rightness of my cause, I must have my facts well\r\nmarshaled, and that could not be done in eighteen hours.\r\n\r\nThen there was the question of the children’s welfare. Had I the right\r\nto leave them the heritage of a mother who had been imprisoned for some\r\noffensive literature of which no one knew the details?\r\n\r\nWhat was I to do? Should I get another lawyer, one with personal\r\ninfluence who could secure a postponement, and should we then go into\r\ncourt together and fight it out? I had no money for such a luxury.\r\nShould I follow the inevitable suggestion of the “I-told-you-so’s” and\r\ntake my medicine? Yes, but what medicine? I would not swallow a dosage\r\nfor the wrong disease.\r\n\r\nI was not afraid of the penitentiary; I was not afraid of anything\r\nexcept being misunderstood. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, my going\r\nthere could help nobody. I had seen so many people do foolish things\r\nvaliantly, such as wave a red flag, shout inflammatory words, lead a\r\nparade, just for the excitement of doing what the crowd expected of\r\nthem. Then they went to jail for six months, a year perhaps, and what\r\nhappened? Something had been killed in them; they were never heard of\r\nagain. I had seen braver and hardier souls than I vanquished in spirit\r\nand body by prison terms, and I was not going to be lost and broken for\r\nan issue which was not the real one, such as the entirely unimportant\r\n_Woman Rebel_ articles. Had I been able to print _Family Limitation_\r\nearlier, and to swing the indictment around that, going to jail might\r\nhave had some significance.\r\n\r\nGoing away was much more difficult than remaining. But if I were to sail\r\nfor Europe I could prepare my case adequately and return then to win or\r\nlose in the courts. There was a train for Canada within a few hours.\r\nCould I take it? Should I take it? Could I ever make those who had\r\nadvised me against this work and these activities understand? Could I\r\never make anyone understand? How could I separate myself from the\r\nchildren without seeing them once more? Peggy’s leg was swollen from\r\nvaccination. This kept worrying me, made me hesitate, anxious. It was so\r\nhard to decide what to do.\r\n\r\nPerfectly still, my watch on the table, I marked the minutes fly. There\r\ncould be no retreat once I boarded that train. The torture of\r\nuncertainty, the agony of making a decision only to reverse it! The hour\r\ngrew later and later. This was like both birth and death—you had to meet\r\nthem alone.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty minutes before train time I knew that I must go. I wrote\r\ntwo letters, one to Judge Hazel, one to Mr. Content, to be received at\r\nthe desk the next day, informing them of my action. I had asked for a\r\nmonth and it had been refused. This denial of right and freedom\r\ncompelled me to leave my home and my three children until I made ready\r\nmy case, which dealt with society rather than an individual. I would\r\nnotify them when I came back. Whether this were in a month or a year\r\ndepended on what I found it necessary to do. Finally, as though to say,\r\n“Make the most of it,” I enclosed to each a copy of _Family Limitation_.\r\n\r\nParting from all that I held dear in life, I left New York at midnight,\r\nwithout a passport, not knowing whether I could ever return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Chapter Ten_\r\n\r\n                     WE SPEAK THE SAME GOOD TONGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Montreal I found comfort and refuge. In fact, on any road I took men\r\nand women who knew about the _Woman Rebel_ came to my aid. I shall never\r\nforget the generosity of the Baineses who met me at the train and\r\nwelcomed me to their home. They had been friends of Walt Whitman and\r\nstill honored “his” memory. I sat at the table where “he” had sat, and\r\nin “his” chair. Among their many kindnesses they gave me an introduction\r\nto Edward Carpenter, also mentioned in awed tones, leader of the Whitman\r\ngroup in England and author of _Love’s Coming of Age_, which was then on\r\nevery modern bookshelf.\r\n\r\nSince I was charged with felony I could be extradited. I was obliged,\r\ntherefore, in buying my passage, to choose a new name. No sooner had I\r\nselected the atrociously ugly “Bertha Watson,” which seemed to rob me of\r\nfemininity, than I wanted to be rid of it. But once having adopted it I\r\ncould not escape.\r\n\r\nI boarded the _RMS Virginian_, laden with munitions, food, Englishmen\r\nreturning home for war duty, and Canadians going over. Even before the\r\nprinting of _Family Limitation_ had begun in August, I had arranged a\r\nkey message which would release all the pamphlets simultaneously\r\nwhenever it should be received by any of four trusted lieutenants. In\r\ncase one should be arrested, another ill, or a third die, still\r\neverything would go forward as provided for. Three days out of Montreal\r\nI sent a cable and shortly had one in reply that the program was being\r\nexecuted as planned. My soul was sick and my heart empty for those I\r\nloved; the one gleam in this dreadful night of despair was the faint\r\nhope that my efforts might, perhaps, make Peggy’s future easier.\r\n\r\nThe government official examining credentials at Liverpool said sternly,\r\n“England is at war, Madam. You can’t expect us to let you through. We’re\r\nsending back people without passports every day, and I can’t make an\r\nexception in your case.”\r\n\r\nBut I had Good Luck as an ally; she comes so often to help in\r\nemergencies. A shipboard acquaintance telephoned and pulled wires, a\r\nprocedure not so common in England as in the United States. On his\r\nguarantee that I would get a passport from the American Embassy\r\nimmediately on reaching London I was allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nI wound through dirty streets in a cab to the Adelphi Palace. It rained\r\nall day, the wind blew, its howling came through the windows and crept\r\ndown the chimney. Homesickness swept over me worse than ever before or\r\nsince. I knew it would not do to “set and think” as the Quakers say, so\r\nI wandered about in the business district, trying to adjust my mind to\r\nthe prices marked in the store windows in order to have some idea of\r\nwhat they were in dollars and cents. I viewed church architecture and\r\nthe Cathedral, which was not expected to be finished for fifty years. It\r\ndid not look so splendid, but since everything about it was closed I\r\nreally could not tell.\r\n\r\nLiverpool was a quaint city. I liked its weathered brick houses, and the\r\nevenness and settled feeling, as though the people in them planned to\r\nremain where they were for time everlasting. The women of the poor were\r\nunconcernedly wearing on the streets dresses originally made for\r\nbustles, hats with feathers, caricatures which should have been stuffed\r\naway in attics forty years before.\r\n\r\nBertha Watson had a letter to the local Fabian Society, and at six I\r\nwent to the Clarion Café, where it foregathered each Friday. I presented\r\nher letter, was welcomed heartily, and invited to the discussion. I\r\nfound the English then and later polite in speech and action, tolerant\r\nin listening. One of the members helped me to locate temporary rooms\r\nwhile I waited for the arrival of letters and messages from the United\r\nStates. These lodgings were in the home of gentle, middle-class people\r\nto whom I paid thirty shillings a week, including breakfast and dinner.\r\n\r\nI shall always be glad I went to that meeting, because there I met\r\nLorenzo Portet, once companion of Francisco Ferrer and now heir to his\r\neducational work, which both believed was the key to Spanish\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nAfter the attempted assassination of Alfonso XIII and Victoria of\r\nEngland, the Government had arrested twenty-five hundred Spaniards\r\nhaving republican ideas, among them Ferrer. His school had been closed\r\nand he had been jailed. When he had been eventually released, he had\r\nstill been determined to educate for universal peace by means of\r\neconomic justice. Accordingly, as Portet stated it, he had reopened a\r\nschool for all Spain by publishing labor texts at Barcelona. This again\r\nhad earned him no reward from a grateful Government. In 1909 he had been\r\narrested in a purge of republicans, stood up against a wall and shot,\r\nand his body thrown into a ditch.\r\n\r\nFerrer had left his money to Portet, who was now fulfilling his trust by\r\nfeeding the country with modern scientific translations from Italy,\r\nFrance, and England. He was a man of middle height and weight whose\r\nalert glance summed you up with an accuracy occasionally disturbing.\r\nAfter our initial encounter he called on me with punctiliousness and\r\nformality, and produced an article from a New York magazine which\r\ncarried the story of the indictment of Margaret Sanger. “This is you?”\r\nhe questioned with the jumping of all fact which is termed intuition.\r\n\r\nPortet, a born teacher, was then instructing youth at the University of\r\nLiverpool in Spanish. No human being I ever knew could explain with such\r\ninfinite pains the details of a subject. He placed your own opposition\r\nbefore you, marshaled it in all its strength, and then annihilated every\r\npoint, one by one. His humorous cynicism was most baffling to those who\r\nwere merely emotional converts to better worlds. “Civilization?” he\r\nmight say, “Mainly a question of good roads.”\r\n\r\nSometimes in the midst of those long, drab, November weeks I escaped to\r\nWales, where there were endless lanes, winding and hard, with very few\r\ncarts, and all very quiet. Even here were Carnegie libraries, one of\r\nthem turned into a restaurant. I went into the houses of the smelting\r\nworkers at Green Brombo, Wexham, all lovely, minute, stone cottages of\r\ntwo or three rooms, huddled closely together, charming with their walks\r\nand walls and flower gardens. The folk were slow, deliberate, simple.\r\n\r\nLiverpool was only a junction; London was my terminus. There I could\r\nstudy at the British Museum, and meet the Neo-Malthusians. Towards the\r\nend of the month I rolled up to London through miles of chimney-potted\r\nsuburbs; it continued rainy and foggy, but still there was a friendly\r\natmosphere in the air. I seemed to be coming to a second home.\r\n\r\nMy first quarters were on the top floor of a “bed and breakfast” on\r\nTorrington Square, just back of the British Museum. I looked out on\r\nlittle rows of trees, iron fences, steps going up to all the houses.\r\nThere was but one bathroom and to use it cost extra. Every morning about\r\nseven came a knock, and when I opened the door I discovered a midget jug\r\nof hot water outside. I was supposed to break the ice on my large\r\npitcher, mix the two, and pour all into my tin tub, the back of which\r\nrose behind me like a throne. After this winter I realized how the\r\nBritish had acquired their well-known moral courage.\r\n\r\nI had no fireplace, but two floors below was an empty room with a grate.\r\nOccasionally I indulged myself in the luxury of renting it for the\r\nevening, and of buying wood to keep myself warm while I worked. I made\r\nup for it by not having the slatternly Cockney maid bring up tea, and\r\nalso went each morning to the basement dining room for my breakfast,\r\nthereby saving a shilling a week. It was not long before I was stricken\r\nby the first digestive upset I had ever had, and was obliged to call in\r\nan American doctor. He looked me over casually and then, without further\r\nexamination, asked, “Have you been drinking English coffee?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, give it up. The English can’t make coffee; they only know how to\r\nmake tea. Take up English tea.”\r\n\r\nI followed his advice and from that time on, instead of carrying my own\r\neating habits with me, have tried to adjust myself to the food of the\r\ncountry where I happened to be. In this way I get along much better.\r\n\r\nSundays I attended concerts or visited art galleries, though since it\r\nwas war time disappointingly few pictures were being shown. Each week\r\nday, however, found me at the British Museum, going in with the opening\r\nof the gates in the morning. In order to secure permission to work, you\r\nhad to have a card, but once you obtained it, you could take a special\r\nseat and books were reserved for you. My aim was to present my case from\r\nall angles, to make the trial soundly historical so that birth control\r\nwould be seriously discussed in America. Therefore, I read avidly and\r\nvoluminously many weighty tomes, and turned carefully the yellowed,\r\nbrittle pages of pamphlets and broadsides, finding much that was dull,\r\nmuch that was irrelevant, but also much that was amusing, if only for\r\nthe ponderous manner of its expression. In the end I had a picture of\r\nwhat had gone before.\r\n\r\nThe father of family limitation was Thomas Robert Malthus, born in 1766\r\nat the Rookery, near Dorking, Surrey. In 1798 this curate of Albury\r\npublished his _Principle of Population_ and in the initial chapter laid\r\ndown his famous postulates: “first, that food is necessary to the\r\nexistence of man; second, that the passion between the sexes is\r\nnecessary, and will remain nearly in its present state....” Consequently\r\nthe unrestrained fertility of the human race was certain to outstrip the\r\navailable fruits of the earth, and, although the natural checks of war,\r\ndisease, and privation had controlled population for centuries, they had\r\nbrought misery, disaster, and death in their train. His solution was\r\nvoluntary and intelligent control of the birth rate by means of late\r\nmarriage, which left few years for childbearing. However, human nature\r\nis such that Malthus might preach forever without anyone’s heeding his\r\nadvice. Not until the profound economic depression which followed the\r\nNapoleonic Wars were people worried into concern over surplus\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nTo John Stuart Mill the production of large families was to be regarded\r\nin the same light as drunkenness or any other physical excess. In the\r\nvery first edition of his _Political Economy_ he spoke of “prudence, by\r\nwhich either marriages are sparingly contracted, or care is taken that\r\nchildren beyond a certain number shall not be the fruit,” and concluded\r\nthat “the grand practical problem is to find the means of limiting the\r\nnumber of births.” But he left it merely as a grand, practical problem.\r\n\r\nFrancis Place, the master tailor of Charing Cross, was born in a private\r\ndebtors’ prison kept by his father in Vinegar Yard. He was the first to\r\nsuggest the idea of contraception as a remedy for poverty, but was more\r\npractical in his preaching than in his performance, fathering as he did\r\nfifteen children. In 1822 he published _Illustrations and Proofs of the\r\nPrinciple of Population_:\r\n\r\n  If, above all, it were once clearly understood, that it was not\r\n  disreputable for married persons to avail themselves of such\r\n  precautionary means as would, without being injurious to health, or\r\n  destructive of female delicacy, prevent conception, a sufficient\r\n  check might at once be given to the increase of population beyond\r\n  the means of subsistence; vice and misery, to a prodigious extent,\r\n  might be removed from society, and the object of Mr. Malthus, Mr.\r\n  Godwin, and of every philanthropic person, be promoted.\r\n\r\nPlace had educated himself on Adam Smith, Locke, Hume, Thomas Paine, and\r\nBurke. To his remarkable library came many notable thinkers and men of\r\nletters. Among them was Robert Owen, the textile industrialist, who, in\r\nhis _Moral Physiology_, offered openly a method of contraception:\r\n\r\n  I sit down to write a little treatise, which will subject me to\r\n  abuse from the self-righteous, to misrepresentation from the\r\n  hypocritical, and to reproach even from the honestly prejudiced.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to young men and women who still believed in virtue and\r\nhappiness. “A human being is a puppet, a slave, if his ignorance is to\r\nbe the safeguard of his virtue.” In reply to the accusation that coitus\r\ninterruptus was unnatural, he pointed out that the thwarting of any\r\nhuman wish or impulse might be so termed. “If this trifling restraint is\r\nto be called unnatural, what shall be said of celibacy?”\r\n\r\nOwen in his youth had been impressed by the sufferings of the working\r\nclasses, and, in a first effort to lighten the burden of his employees,\r\nhad instituted many reforms in the New Lanark Mills, himself prospering\r\nmaterially in so doing; he was less successful when he emigrated to the\r\nUnited States and at New Harmony, Indiana, established a short-lived\r\ncommunal colony. However, his coming to America had at least one\r\nimportant result. His book influenced Doctor Charles Knowlton of Boston\r\nto write a tract entitled _Fruits of Philosophy_ in which he recommended\r\na chemical formula and other methods to prevent conception. I had not\r\nfound a trace of this in my previous research, even in Boston where it\r\nhad been published.\r\n\r\nKnowlton’s reaffirmation of the desirability both from a political and\r\nsocial point of view for mankind to be able to limit at will the number\r\nof offspring without sacrificing the attendant gratification of the\r\nreproductive instinct, would have been little noticed had it not been\r\nfor the repercussion in England forty years later.\r\n\r\nDuring the early Victorian uprush of industrialism a man’s children had\r\nbeen breadwinners, and family limitation had naturally lapsed. But when\r\nhumanitarian legislation had begun to rescue children from factories,\r\nthe population specter had shown itself once more.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 was formed the Malthusian League, designed to influence public\r\nopinion and overcome the prevailing misconception of Malthusianism, and\r\nin 1876 a Bristol bookseller brought out an English edition of _Fruits\r\nof Philosophy_. He was promptly arrested on the charge of publishing an\r\nobscene book, and sentence was suspended on his plea of guilty.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant rationalist and freethinker, Charles Bradlaugh, a\r\nredoubtable personality, together with Annie Besant, later the renowned\r\nTheosophist but then a young rebel, started a printing partnership and\r\nsold the pamphlet. Although not approving it in all its details they\r\ndetermined to contest the right to publish it and to prove that\r\nprevention of conception was not obscene.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary interest was aroused in their trial before Lord Chief\r\nJustice Cockburn and a special jury. The Solicitor General himself\r\nappeared as chief counsel for the prosecution. Taking a copy of _Fruits\r\nof Philosophy_ in his hands he opened it solemnly and said, “It is\r\nreally extremely painful to me,” then hesitating, “very painful to me to\r\nhave to read this.” But he did so.\r\n\r\nBradlaugh and Besant conducted their own defense. The latter with\r\neloquence and astonishing poise held the admiring attention of the court\r\nfor two days. Nevertheless, both were convicted of defaming the morals\r\nof the public, sentenced to six months in jail and a thousand-dollar\r\nfine, and required to put up guarantees of twenty-five hundred dollars\r\nfor good behavior during the next two years. The case was immediately\r\nappealed. Fortunately the upper court dismissed it on a technicality,\r\nbecause specific evidence of obscenity was not included; if the words\r\nwere polluting they had to appear in the record.\r\n\r\nThis decision settled for all time in England that contraception was not\r\nto be classed among the obscenities. As a result, new life was injected\r\ninto the Malthusian League and its name was changed to the\r\nNeo-Malthusian Society. In the first issue of its monthly journal it set\r\nforth a modest claim: “We have the ONLY REMEDY that the disease of\r\nsociety can be cured by.” Instead of the impractical advice of Malthus\r\nto marry late, the Neo-Malthusians advised early marriage, the use of\r\ncontraceptive methods, and children born according to the earning\r\ncapacity of the father; a man’s station in life should determine the\r\nnumber of his children. Furthermore, they intended one by one to “prick\r\nthe flimsy bubbles of emigration, lessened production, and home\r\ncolonization, which are from time to time put forward.” The emphasis was\r\nstill placed on the social and economic aspects rather than the personal\r\ntragedies of women.\r\n\r\nThat was in 1876; now in 1914 the Drysdales, Dr. C. V. and his wife,\r\nBessie, were the guiding spirits of the Society. They had a long\r\nheritage of Malthusianism behind them; the uncle of the former, Dr.\r\nGeorge Drysdale, fresh from Edinburgh in 1854, had anonymously published\r\nhis _Elements of Social Science_, which had gone into fifteen languages.\r\nHe had even himself studied Chinese to ensure a reasonably accurate\r\ntranslation in that tongue. In the darkest days of Victorianism, this\r\nyoung physician had included the New Woman in his interpretation of\r\nMalthus. Both he and his brother Charles, also a physician, had been in\r\nlove with Alice Vickery, who had chosen the latter and borne him a son,\r\nthe present C.V.\r\n\r\nAlice Vickery was as great in her day as Mary Wollstonecraft in hers.\r\nAfter a tremendous struggle, which included getting her degree in Dublin\r\nand her training in Paris, she had proved her right to enter the medical\r\nprofession, and had become the first woman doctor in England.\r\n\r\nMy keenest desire was to get in touch with the Drysdales. They invited\r\nme to tea at their offices—offices in the English sense, not ours. I\r\nsquelched through the inevitable rain to Queen Anne’s Chambers and was\r\nastonished to find nothing on the door except Dr. C. V. Drysdale’s name.\r\nThe term Malthusian was not considered proper according to the\r\nlandlord’s ideas of propriety. In fact, throughout England the word\r\nbrought up antagonism. People crossed the street to avoid it.\r\n\r\nI entered a sitting room, gay with chintz-covered chairs and a sofa,\r\npillows at the back, quite fitted to Queen Anne’s own day. A fire was\r\nburning cheerily, yet even this was not so welcome as the open arms and\r\nexcitement with which I was greeted, not only by the Drysdales but also\r\nby Dr. Binnie Dunlop, dark, Scotch, thin, and dapper, intellectually\r\nenthusiastic although not emotionally so; by Olive Johnston, the\r\nfaithful secretary who had worked for many years with the Drysdales; and\r\nby F. W. Stella Browne, an ardent Feminist whose faintly florid face,\r\nhair never quite white, and indefatigable vivacity are the same a\r\nquarter of a century later. Many women in causes are like that;\r\nsomething in their spirit keeps them forever young.\r\n\r\nDr. Drysdale was then in his early forties, slender, fair, inclined to\r\nbe bald. In his ebullience he was not at all British, but his pleasing,\r\nwarm, and courteous personality was British at its best. Bessie\r\nDrysdale, about her husband’s age, was the practical member, dispensing\r\ncharming hospitality. The others were like an army meeting me, but she\r\nbrought up the rear with tea and cakes and comforting things.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me I had seen them and known them all before. I was\r\nimmediately certain I had come to the right place. In the United States\r\nI had been alone, pulling against all whose broad, general principles\r\nwere the same as mine but who disapproved of my actions. But these new\r\nfriends saw eye to eye with me. Instead of heaping criticism and fears\r\nupon me, they offered all the force of an international organization as\r\nwell as their encyclopedic minds to back me up.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Neo-Malthusians had been to educate the educators.\r\nThey believed that once the practice of family limitation had been\r\nestablished among the well-to-do and socially prominent, it would be\r\ntaken up by the lower strata. They were not discouraged, although after\r\nalmost forty years success seemed as far away as ever; the working\r\nclasses not only evinced no desire for the benefits of family\r\nlimitation, but did not even know such a thing existed.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the room appreciated my rebellion and extended\r\ncongratulations on a name having been coined which was so simple and\r\neasy to understand as birth control. When I told them how I had managed\r\nthe distribution of the _Family Limitation_ pamphlets Dr. Drysdale stood\r\nup impetuously and said, “Oh, would to God we had a Comstock law!\r\nThere’s nothing can so stir the British people as a bad law. Then they\r\nwill do something to change it!”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon was one of the most encouraging and delightful of my\r\nlife. The warmth of my reception strengthened me to face the future. It\r\nlessened my dreadful homesickness and curbed the ever-growing impulse to\r\nescape from war-sick London and hurry back to the children. During my\r\nstay I saw much of the Drysdales and their group, and between us all\r\ngrew up a close kinship which has lasted through the stormy years.\r\n\r\nI like to think of London at this time chiefly because of all my new\r\nfriends and the laughter they brought me. Of late there had been little\r\nof it in my life, but with every friend I had in England—more than with\r\nany other people I have ever known—I laughed, and this laughter knit and\r\nwelded the bonds of comradeship.\r\n\r\nOne day in the British Museum I was standing by the catalogs, which were\r\nin the form of books, waiting until a man near me finished the volume I\r\nwanted to consult. I glanced at him idly, then more closely, thinking I\r\nidentified the profile from pictures I had seen. When he had put the\r\nbook down I ventured tentatively, “Aren’t you Edward Carpenter?”\r\n\r\nAlmost without looking at me he replied, “Yes, and aren’t you Margaret\r\nSanger?”\r\n\r\nIt was a shock for Bertha Watson to hear this name repeated out loud in\r\na public place. However, Mr. Carpenter’s recognition was readily\r\nexplainable. He had been more or less prepared to see me because he had\r\nalready received my letter and had that morning at my rooming house been\r\ntold I never returned from the British Museum until evening. Since we\r\ncould not talk in this hall of silence, we adjourned to the Egyptian\r\nRoom, and then to lunch. He was human, full of wit, fun, and humor—a\r\nlive person who exuded magnetism.\r\n\r\nEdward Carpenter reassured me that what I was doing was not merely of\r\nthe present but belonged even more to the future. From this fine spirit\r\nI drew confirmation of the purity of my endeavor, something essential\r\nfor me to take back to America if others there were to experience the\r\nsame sense of justification. We beyond the Atlantic were still uncertain\r\nof our ethics, and even of our morals. We needed the sanction of British\r\npublic opinion and the approval of their great philosophers, so that we\r\ncould be strong in our beliefs.\r\n\r\nDuring the first weeks in England I did not feel vehemently about the\r\nWar, especially as signs were displayed everywhere, “Business as usual.”\r\nI supposed it would be a little flurry, soon over. War talk, of course,\r\nwas universal. The German espionage system was much discussed. I\r\nwondered whether it were not the general characteristic of the German\r\nalways to observe and be accurate in detail which made his information\r\nvaluable. He did the same thing in the United States, where nobody\r\nthought of calling him a spy. Everywhere women were knitting socks and\r\nmitts, but I was more impressed by the fact they were smoking in hotel\r\nlobbies—a new indication of emancipation to me—and even rolling their\r\nown cigarettes. If a woman came in for tea, without a word being said, a\r\nbell hop produced her own box of tobacco. When she left, it was returned\r\nto its proper place.\r\n\r\nAs the months went on, however, to be an American became almost as\r\nunlucky as to be a German. Whoever wished to remain safely in England\r\nmust agree with England, give over every vestige of independent thinking\r\nor free expression. Wherever I went I heard mention of “Traitorous\r\nAmerica.” At one dining-car table a gray-haired Englishman, unaware of\r\nmy nationality, asserted, “Americans will do anything for money.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed his companion. “They do not care whom their bullets kill.\r\nThey get paid for them.” He was a young Dutchman, apparently just\r\nreturned from the East Indies, and the conversation between the two\r\ndeveloped briskly. Americans were a “mixed breed without souls; they had\r\nnone of the qualities which make a nation great—no traditions, history,\r\nart, music, absolutely nothing but their money; they had to come to\r\nEurope for everything—to England for laws, customs, and morals, to\r\nFrance for fashions and arts; they were human leeches fastened on Europe\r\nwithout incentive, originality, or creative ability; they—”\r\n\r\nI interrupted, “What do you want America to do? Why should she get into\r\nthis? Does she owe loyalty to England or France or Russia?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, but for Belgium. America signed the Hague Treaty with the rest\r\nof us, and she has not stood by it.”\r\n\r\nTo this I advanced the argument, “We Americans are not like Europeans.\r\nWe are a heterogeneous mixture of all the fighting forces and nations of\r\nthe world. We include the Irish who hate England, and Jews who hardly\r\ncan be said to love Russia. A large part of our population—industrious,\r\ncivil, reliable, and prosperous—are Germans, with whom our Scandinavians\r\nare sympathetic. Who then have we to ally against Germany? And why?—a\r\nvery small far-back mention of gratitude to France for her help in our\r\nRevolution against British rule—and the Statue of Liberty.”\r\n\r\nOn the whole I came more nearly being a nationalist when I left England\r\nthan when I went there. I had to do such battle to explain the United\r\nStates that, almost involuntarily, I felt myself becoming less of an\r\ninternationalist. It was a strange feeling, as though somebody you knew\r\nand loved were being criticized, and you took up the cudgels in defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Eleven_\r\n\r\n                             HAVELOCK ELLIS\r\n\r\n          “_He who ascends to mountain-tops shall find\r\n          Their loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\r\n          Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\r\n          Contending tempests on his naked head._”\r\n                                              LORD BYRON\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Christmas approached, my loneliness for the children increased. This\r\nwas their particular time. I had messages from and about them, but these\r\ncould not give the small, intimate details; the Atlantic was a broad\r\nspan, seeming more vast to letter writers. I missed their voices, their\r\ncaresses, even their little quarrels. I almost wondered whether solitary\r\nconfinement in prison were not preferable to my present isolation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this stark yearning to be with them and share their tree\r\nI received a cordial note from Havelock Ellis asking me to come to tea.\r\nWith kindly foresight he had given me explicit directions how to reach\r\nFourteen Dover Mansions in Brixton across the Thames. I boarded a\r\ncrowded bus at Oxford Circus. Though it was a miserable day near the\r\ndark end of 1914, the spirit of Christmas was in the air and everyone\r\nwas laden with beribboned bundles and bright packages.\r\n\r\nLooking askance at the police station which occupied the lower floor I\r\nclimbed up the stairs, and, with the shyness of an adolescent, full of\r\nfears and uncertainties, lifted the huge brass knocker. The figure of\r\nEllis himself appeared in the door. He seemed a giant in stature, a\r\nlovely, simple man in loose-fitting clothes, with powerful head and\r\nwonderful smile. He was fifty-five then, but that head will never\r\nchange—the shock of white hair, the venerable beard, shaggy though\r\nwell-kept, the wide, expressive mouth and deep-set eyes, sad even in\r\nspite of the humorous twinkle always latent.\r\n\r\nI was conscious immediately that I was in the presence of a great man,\r\nyet I was startled at first by his voice as he welcomed me in. It was\r\ntypically English, high and thin. I once talked to a prisoner at Sing\r\nSing who had been in the death house for three years and could speak\r\nonly in whispers thereafter. Ellis had been a hermit for twenty-five. He\r\nhad lived in the Bush in Australia, and later secluded himself in his\r\nstudy. Nevertheless, the importance of what he had to say much more than\r\nmade up for the instrument which conveyed it.\r\n\r\nHe led me to the living room through which the cheerless twilight of a\r\nwinter afternoon in London barely penetrated, and seated me before a\r\nlittle gas fire. Some rooms impress you as ghastly cold even when hot.\r\nThis one, though lacking central heating, had the warmth of many books.\r\nHe lit two candles on the mantel, which flickered softly over his\r\nfeatures, giving him the aspect of a seer.\r\n\r\nWe sat down and quiet fell. I tried a few aimless remarks but I\r\nstuttered with embarrassment. Ellis was still. Small talk was not\r\npossible with him; you had to utter only the deepest truths within you.\r\nNo other human being could be so silent and remain so poised and calm in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWhile Ellis was preparing tea in the kitchen he left me to look over his\r\nlibrary and the most recent news from America. He had laid out and\r\nmarked certain pertinent items which he thought might not have come to\r\nmy attention. This, I later found, was one of his most endearing\r\ncharacteristics. He always entered into the life of the other person in\r\nlittle details, never forgetting even the kind of bread or olives,\r\nfruits or wines, you preferred. His detachment was not incompatible with\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nSoon appeared a large tray, laden with tea, cakes, and bread and butter,\r\nand we sat down before the humming flame and talked and talked; and as\r\nwe talked we wove into our lives an intangible web of mutual interests.\r\nI began to realize then that the men who are truly great are the easiest\r\nto meet and understand. After those first few moments I was at peace,\r\nand content as I had never been before. Entirely unaware of the\r\nreverence he aroused, Ellis pasted no labels on himself, had no poses,\r\nmade no effort to impress. He was simply, quite un-self-consciously,\r\nwhat he was.\r\n\r\nWhen he asked me to describe the details of how I had locked horns with\r\nthe law, I spoke glowingly of the heartening approval which the\r\nDrysdales had just given me. He did not show the same enthusiasm; in\r\nfact he was rather concerned, and not so ready with praise for my lack\r\nof respect for the established order, believing so strongly in my case\r\nthat he wanted me to avoid mistakes. I think his influence was always\r\nmore or less subduing and moderating; he tried to get me, too, to take\r\nthe middle road. Though he occasionally alluded to some of the more\r\namusing phases of the trial of his own work, he had pushed it into the\r\nback of his mind.\r\n\r\nThis monumental study intended for doctors and psychologists had been\r\nprojected when Ellis was a medical student of nineteen. But his short\r\npractice of medicine, his editing of the _Mermaid Series of Old British\r\nDramatists_, and the preparation of several sociological treatises, had\r\nintervened before, in 1898, _Sexual Inversion_, the first volume, had\r\nappeared. George Bedborough, printer, had been arrested for selling a\r\ncopy, and charged with “publishing an obscene libel with the intention\r\nof corrupting the laws of Her Majesty’s subjects.” Ellis, the scholar,\r\npreferred to ignore controversy; the martyr’s crown would not have\r\ncoincided favorably with calm and dispassionate research. Judging it\r\nmerely stupid of the British Government to have pushed the case to\r\ntrial, he suspended the sale of the volume immediately, so disappointed\r\nthat his own countrymen did not understand his motives that he stated\r\nthen and there he would not have his other volumes published in England,\r\nand he never has.\r\n\r\nHe, beyond any other person, has been able to clarify the question of\r\nsex, and free it from the smudginess connected with it from the\r\nbeginning of Christianity, raise it from the dark cellar, set it on a\r\nhigher plane. That has been his great contribution. Like an alchemist,\r\nhe transmuted the psychic disturbance which had followed my reading of\r\nhis books into a spiritual essence.\r\n\r\nWe had many things to discuss, but suddenly it dawned upon me that I\r\nmust have outstayed my time. Seven o’clock struck before I realized how\r\nlate it was. It had seemed so short to me.\r\n\r\nI was not excited as I went back through the heavy fog to my own dull\r\nlittle room. My emotion was too deep for that. I felt as though I had\r\nbeen exalted into a hitherto undreamed-of world.\r\n\r\nSome of my new friends, Guy Aldred, Henry Sara, and Rose Witcop, invited\r\nme to tea with them Christmas Eve. Rose was deliberate in her movements,\r\ntall and dark, with straight black hair falling low over her forehead\r\nand caught at the nape of the neck. She and Guy were both ardent\r\npacifists. A few days earlier I had overheard them reproving their son,\r\naged six, for suggesting that Santa Claus bring him some lead soldiers.\r\nHe had seen uniforms in every street and toy replicas in every shop\r\nwindow; all little boys were having them. I had not been able to send\r\nmany presents to my children, and before leaving the house slipped into\r\nhis room. He was sound asleep and his clothes were stretched out neatly\r\nat the foot of his bed. Outraging my own principles I tucked a box of\r\nsoldiers under the blanket so that he might see this martial array the\r\nfirst thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nRose and Guy were thoroughly disgusted with me.\r\n\r\nMuch that evening combined to stir me. Carol singers paraded Torrington\r\nSquare, group after group lifting plaintive voices in _Good King\r\nWenceslas_ and _We Three Kings of Orient Are_. I was headachy but I went\r\nout and strolled about the streets to see Merrie England at Yuletide. I\r\nhad on so much clothing that I could scarcely walk, and still I was icy\r\ncold. It was just about a year since I had left France with the\r\nchildren, never to be reunited with Bill.\r\n\r\nSince I am slow in my decisions and cannot separate myself from past\r\nemotions quickly, all breaches must come gradually. A measure of\r\nfrustration is an inevitable accompaniment to endeavor. My marriage had\r\nnot been unhappy; I had not let it be. It had not failed because of lack\r\nof love, romance, wealth, respect, or any of those qualities which were\r\nsupposed to cause marital rifts, but because the interests of each had\r\nwidened beyond those of the other. Development had proceeded so fast\r\nthat our lives had diverged, due to that very growth which we had sought\r\nfor each other. I could not live with a human being conscious that my\r\nnecessities were thwarting or dwarfing his progress.\r\n\r\nIt had been a crowded year, encompassing the heights and depths of\r\nfeeling. Christmas Eve was too much for me. I went back again and sat,\r\nwondering whether the children were well and contented. The next morning\r\ncame a cable from them, flowers from Bill, and a nice note from Havelock\r\nEllis.\r\n\r\nThereafter Havelock aided me immensely in my studies by guiding my\r\nreading. Tuesdays and Fridays were his days at the British Museum, and\r\nhe often left little messages at my seat, listing helpful articles or\r\noffering suggestions as to books which might assist me in the particular\r\naspect I was then engaged upon.\r\n\r\nIf when traveling about with him on the tram, going to a concert,\r\nshopping for coffee and cigarettes outside the Museum, a thought came to\r\nhim, he would pull out a bit of paper and jot down notes. That was how\r\nhe compiled his material for books, gathering it piecemeal and storing\r\nit away in envelopes. Anything on the dance went into the dance\r\nenvelope, music into music, and so on. As soon as any one became full\r\nenough to attract his attention, he took it out and started to make\r\nsomething of it.\r\n\r\nSometimes we dined together at a Soho restaurant; occasionally I had tea\r\nat his flat. In his combined kitchen and dining room, warmed by a coal\r\nstove, he did his work, and there also he cooked meals for which he\r\nmarketed himself. He was proud of being able to lay a fire with fewer\r\nsticks and less paper than an expert charwoman, and once said he would\r\nrather win praise for the creation of a salad than of an essay.\r\n\r\nOne of the four rooms was set aside for the use of his wife, Edith. She\r\npreferred the country and lived on her farm in Cornwall, whereas\r\nHavelock loved to be in the city; though he was not a part of it, he\r\nliked to hear it going on about him. Whenever she came to town she found\r\nall her books and possessions inviolate; whenever he went to Cornwall he\r\nfound everything ready for him. Either of them could, on impulse, board\r\na train without baggage and in a few hours be at home.\r\n\r\nEdith was short and stocky, high-colored, curly-haired, with mystical\r\nblue eyes but accompanying them a strain of practicality. She could run\r\nthe farm, look after the livestock, and dispose of her products. Her\r\nvitality was so great that it sought other outlets in writing fiction.\r\n\r\nBernard Shaw was once trying to find his way to the Ellis farm and\r\nstopped at a cottage to inquire whether he was on the right road. The\r\ngoodwife could not tell him.\r\n\r\n“But I know Mr. and Mrs. Ellis live near here.”\r\n\r\nShe kept protesting nobody of that name was in the neighborhood until\r\nShaw pointed to a house which appeared as though it might be the one.\r\n“Who lives there?”\r\n\r\n“Two strangers.”\r\n\r\n“What do they do?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the man he writes out of other folks’ books, but she writes out of\r\nher head.”\r\n\r\nThe person who saw most of Havelock was Olive Schreiner, a long-standing\r\nfriend of his and of Edith. I was delighted at the chance of meeting the\r\nauthor of _Woman and Labor_ and of another favorite, _The Story of an\r\nAfrican Farm_. She had just come to England for the first time in\r\ntwenty-five years and been caught in the War.\r\n\r\nKnowing Havelock to be a philosopher, I had expected him to be an\r\nelderly man, but, despite his white hair, had found him young,\r\nphysically and mentally. Olive Schreiner’s writings were so alive that I\r\nhad visualized a young woman. Instead, although her hair was black, her\r\nsquare and stout Dutch body was old and spread. She had, perhaps, been\r\npartly aged by the frightful asthma from which she had suffered for so\r\nmany years. The effect was enhanced by the dark surroundings of the\r\nshabby hotel in which I first saw her.\r\n\r\nCertainly another contributing factor was her despondence over the War.\r\nAlthough her mother was English, her father Dutch, and she a British\r\nsubject, her Germanic name was causing her the most harrowing\r\ncomplications. Fellow hotel guests of her own sex, when they spied her\r\nname on the register or heard her paged, insisted to the manager that\r\neither she should be removed or they were going to seek quarters\r\nelsewhere. She was literally being hounded from place to place.\r\n\r\nPossibly Olive felt the tragedy of the War more than any other person I\r\nmet in London at this time. She had never believed that “the boys would\r\nbe out of the trenches by Christmas,” or that business as usual could\r\ncontinue much longer. Already she had seen the horrors of armed conflict\r\nin South Africa; it seemed to begin lightly, but it did not end that\r\nway. She feared the whole world might be trapped in this one, that\r\ninternationalism and the peace movement were practically finished, and\r\nthat a whole new generation had to be born before we could recover what\r\nwe had lost. She appeared to me then unduly disheartened; it was only\r\nlater when her words came true that I comprehended how accurate were her\r\nprophecies.\r\n\r\nBetter than any living being Olive understood Havelock. I realized this\r\nduring a conversation between herself and Edith. The latter had been in\r\nthe United States lecturing on three writers: her husband, James Hinton,\r\nwhom he admired tremendously, and Edward Carpenter. Her reception had\r\nconvinced her the name of Ellis had gone beyond the borders of England,\r\nand she wanted him to return with her the following year to reap some of\r\nthe reward of the respect thousands of Americans had for him.\r\n\r\nHavelock was terror-stricken, first at the idea of coming to a new\r\ncountry, and second at the mere mention of speaking in public. He could\r\nimagine no tortures worse than these. But in order to please Edith, whom\r\nhe loved dearly, and also because her persistency and determination were\r\nso great that he found it hard to oppose her, he agreed to leave it to\r\nthe three of us.\r\n\r\nEdith and I had called on Olive to talk it over. She, as usual, had just\r\nrecently moved. This time she was more cheerful, and after tea we took\r\nup the momentous question of the destiny of another individual. Edith,\r\nwith her customary fire and fervor, started in to persuade Olive,\r\nHavelock’s lifelong friend, and me, his new friend, that going to\r\nAmerica would be a crowning glory for him. She entreated our aid in\r\nmaking him decide to do so.\r\n\r\nOlive characteristically listened with rapt attention until Edith had\r\nfinished. Then she turned to me. “What do you think Havelock should do?”\r\n\r\nI, knowing how much Americans expected of a speaker in the way of voice,\r\npersonality, and gift of oratory, and also how easily they could be\r\ndisappointed unless gestures and external appearance fulfilled their\r\nanticipations, concluded he would not find this crown of glory or this\r\nuniversal acclaim, and that he would probably return disillusioned after\r\nthe first fanfare of publicity. I said, without giving my reasons, “I\r\ndon’t think he should go.”\r\n\r\n“Have either of you asked Havelock what he wants to do?” Olive\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n“I have,” said Edith, “and he doesn’t want to.”\r\n\r\n“Then that settles the matter entirely,” replied Olive. “Nobody has the\r\nauthority to make another do what he doesn’t want to, no matter how good\r\nyou or I or any of us think it might be for him. I myself will never\r\ntake a step that my instinct or intuition tells me not to. I am guided\r\nwholly by that instinct, and if I should awaken tomorrow morning and my\r\ninner voice told me to go to the top of the Himalayas, I would pack up\r\nand go.”\r\n\r\nThis brief speech determined the question for Havelock, his right to\r\nstay snugly in London, and to give up all the adventure Edith had\r\nplanned for him.\r\n\r\nOlive, in her commonly dark mood, was encouraged more by the work being\r\ndone for women in birth control than by anything else. She herself, who\r\nhad had but one child, which had died, realized its significance. The\r\nlast time I saw her she put both arms around me and said, “We may never\r\nmeet again, but your endeavor is the bright star shining through the\r\nblack clouds of war.”\r\n\r\nShe was not able to go back to South Africa until the War was over. One\r\nmorning, not long afterwards, she was found dead in her bed. According\r\nto her instructions, her little child and beloved dog were removed from\r\ntheir old resting places and Kaffirs carried the three of them to the\r\npeak of a mountain outside Queenstown, where they have since reposed on\r\ntheir high eminence.\r\n\r\nEllis has been called the greatest living English gentleman. But England\r\nalone cannot claim him; he belongs to all mankind. I define him as one\r\nwho radiates truth, energy, and beauty. I see him in a realm above and\r\nbeyond the shouting and the tumult. Captains and kings come and go.\r\nLilliputian warriors strut their hour, and boundary lines between\r\nnations are made and unmade. Although he takes no active share in this\r\nexternal trafficking, he does not dwell apart in an ivory tower of his\r\nown construction.\r\n\r\nThis Olympian seems to be aloof from the pain of the world, yet he has\r\npenetrated profoundly into the persistent problems of the race. Nothing\r\nhuman is alien to his sympathy. His knowledge is broad and deep; his\r\nwisdom even deeper. He makes no strident, blatant effort to cry aloud\r\nhis message, but gradually and in ever-increasing numbers, men and women\r\npause to listen to his serene voice.\r\n\r\nHere is a phenomenon more amazing than the achievements of\r\nradio-activity. Despite all the obstacles and obstructions that have\r\nhindered his expression, his truth has filtered through to minds ready\r\nto receive it. His philosophy, if it can be reduced to an essence, is\r\nthat of life more abundant—attained through a more complete\r\nunderstanding of ourselves and an unruffled charity to all.\r\n\r\nTo Havelock Ellis we owe our concept of that Kingdom of God within us,\r\nthat inner world which hides all our inherent potentialities for joy as\r\nwell as suffering. Thanks to him we realize that happiness must be the\r\nfruit of an attitude towards life, that it is in no way dependent upon\r\nthe rewards or the gifts of fortune. Like St. Francis of Assisi, he\r\nteaches the beauty of nature, of his brother the sun and his sister the\r\nmoon, of birds and fish and animals, and all the pageantry of the\r\npassing seasons.\r\n\r\nI have never felt about any other person as I do about Havelock Ellis.\r\nTo know him has been a bounteous privilege; to claim him friend my\r\ngreatest honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Twelve_\r\n\r\n                           STORK OVER HOLLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nDay after day the attendants at the British Museum piled books and\r\npamphlets on the table before my seat. As I pored over the vital\r\nstatistics of Europe it seemed to me that chiefly in the Netherlands was\r\nthere a force operating towards constructive race building. The Dutch\r\nhad long since adopted a common-sense attitude on the subject, looking\r\nupon having a baby as an economic luxury—something like a piano or an\r\nautomobile that had to be taken care of afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Drysdales often mentioned the great work done by Dr. Aletta Jacobs\r\nof Amsterdam and Dr. Johannes Rutgers of the Hague. The story of Dr.\r\nJacobs’ conquest of nearly insuperable obstacles to a medical career was\r\nparticularly appealing. Born in 1854 in the Province of Groningen, she\r\nwas the eighth child of a physician who, on eight hundred dollars a\r\nyear, had to support his wife and eleven children. Even before\r\nadolescence she had asked defiantly, “What’s the use of brains if you’re\r\nborn a girl?” She was determined to become a doctor like her father,\r\nthough no woman had ever been admitted to Groningen University. Her\r\nspirit was so indomitable that when at seventeen she had passed the\r\nexaminations and demanded entrance, she had been permitted to listen for\r\na year, and then allowed to register as a permanent student.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Dr. Jacobs had finished her studies in medicine at Amsterdam\r\nUniversity and gone to London, where she had attended the Besant and\r\nBradlaugh trial, met the Fabians, met the Malthusians, become an ardent\r\nsuffragist. This first woman physician in the Netherlands had returned\r\nto Amsterdam and there had braved the disapproval of her father’s\r\nfriends by practicing her profession and by opening a free clinic for\r\npoor women and children, where she gave contraceptive advice and\r\ninformation, the first time this had ever been done in the world.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years and within a radius of five miles the proportion of\r\nstillbirths and abortions as well as venereal disease had started to\r\ndecline, children were filling the schools, people were leaving their\r\ncanal boats to go into agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands being such a small country, where one person’s business\r\nwas everybody’s business, such changes could not escape notice. Just\r\nabout this time Dr. Charles R. Drysdale, then President of the English\r\nLeague, had been invited to address an International Medical Congress\r\nheld in Amsterdam. The results of Dr. Jacobs’ clinic were so apparent\r\nthat immediately thereafter the Dutch Neo-Malthusian League had been\r\nformed and thirty-four physicians had joined it. When other centers were\r\nestablished, purely for consultation, the word clinic was applied to\r\nthem also. In 1883 Dr. Mensinga, a gynecologist of Flensburg, Germany,\r\nhad published a description of a contraceptive device called a diaphragm\r\npessary, which he and Dr. Jacobs had perfected. Dr. and Madame Hoitsema\r\nRutgers had taken charge of the League in 1899 with such success that\r\nthe work had spread through that well-ordered kingdom. In recognition of\r\nits extensive and valuable accomplishment, Queen Wilhelmina had\r\npresented it with a medal of honor and a charter, and counted it one of\r\nthe great public utilities.\r\n\r\nIn my statistical investigations I paid special attention to the birth\r\nand mortality rates of the Netherlands to see how they had been affected\r\nover this period of thirty-five years. They showed the lowest maternal\r\nmortality, whereas the United States was at the top of the list; three\r\ntimes more mothers’ lives were being saved in the little dike country\r\nthan in my native land. Furthermore, the infant death rate of Rotterdam,\r\nAmsterdam, and the Hague, the three cities in which the League was most\r\nactive, were the lowest of all those in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period the death rate had been cut in half, but,\r\nsurprisingly, I found that the birth rate had been reduced only a third.\r\nIn other words, the death rate had fallen faster than the birth rate,\r\nwhich meant that the population of the Netherlands was increasing more\r\nrapidly than that of any other country in Europe.\r\n\r\nI had much difficulty in reconciling these figures with my preconceived\r\nidea that birth control would automatically bring about a decrease in\r\npopulation. Since it was increasing, then perhaps birth control was not,\r\nafter all, the answer to the economic international problem. If this\r\nwere true all my calculations were going to be upset.\r\n\r\nImpatient to go to the Netherlands and dig out the real facts, not only\r\nfrom Dutch records but from personal observation, I decided quietly—most\r\nof my decisions in those days were quiet ones—to cross the Channel. This\r\nimplied possible unwelcome encounters with inquisitive officials,\r\nfloating bombs, submarines, and every type of inconvenience and delay,\r\nbut my eagerness made me discount the hindrances.\r\n\r\nI applied, to the Dutch Consul for a visa to Bertha Watson’s passport.\r\n\r\n“Eighty cents, please,” and no questions asked.\r\n\r\nSo that I should not have to return to London before going on to Paris I\r\npresented myself at the French Consulate also. I waited two hours. “Two\r\ndollars, please,” and still no queries.\r\n\r\nI attached myself to the end of the long line waiting at Victoria\r\nStation to have passports inspected, and was soon safely on the train\r\nfor Folkestone. We were late when we reached the Channel. Again we lined\r\nup for inspection. Many Belgian women with four or five children were\r\ngoing back to their people; the sleepy little ones and the tired women\r\nsettled on the platform to rest until some had gone through. Two\r\ndetectives glanced casually at my passport, and then allowed me to enter\r\nthe official chamber. Inspections had been growing steadily more strict;\r\nthis was the ultimate test. There sat in a row three officers in mufti,\r\nwell-fed and brusque with authority. I handed my passport to the first,\r\nwho looked me up and down as though I were a treacherous enemy, then\r\npushed it over to the next. This man too viewed me with suspicion and\r\nmistrust, and pulled out a notebook, scanning the names to see whether\r\nmine were on the proscribed list. The last of the three, who was to make\r\nthe final decision—crisp, trim, and hard as nails in voice and\r\nmanner—demanded, “What are you going to the Continent for, Madam?\r\nAnother joy ride? You Americans must think that’s all this War amounts\r\nto. Can you produce any good reason for letting you through?”\r\n\r\nFortunately I was prepared for such a contingency. I took out of my\r\npurse a letter from Bernarr MacFadden asking me to answer certain\r\nquestions in the form of articles for _Physical Culture_ such as the\r\nrelation between the unfit and population growth. I offered this\r\ndocument while those in line behind me waited restively. He read it\r\nmeticulously, taking longer than necessary as it seemed to me in my\r\nnervousness. At last he folded it neatly and said, “A good work, this.\r\nToo bad someone hasn’t done it before.”\r\n\r\nThen he put his last official stamp on my various papers and I passed\r\nthrough for the gangplank.\r\n\r\nNo complications presented themselves at the Hague, and early on a\r\nJanuary morning in 1915 I registered at an inexpensive hotel. It was\r\ncomforting to hear a radiator sizzling once more. I joined the other\r\nguests who were cheerfully breakfasting together _en famille_ at a\r\nsingle table, and, since I spoke neither Dutch nor German, silently\r\nmunched my black bread and cheese, downed the excellent coffee, and\r\nwatched interestedly. Though stolid in appearance like all the Dutch,\r\nthey were friendly.\r\n\r\nI did not try to telephone Dr. Rutgers. Instead, though it was not yet\r\nnine o’clock, I hailed a taxi and held out to the driver a slip of paper\r\non which I had written the street and number. In response to my ring at\r\nthe door to which I was delivered, a tiny square window in the upper\r\npart opened mysteriously and a face—wizened, aged, and inquisitive—was\r\nframed in the aperture. It remained while I explained my mission.\r\nApparently trust was inspired because, my story finished, the door swung\r\nwide and the face, materialized into Dr. Rutgers, ushered me into the\r\nlibrary, where I waited until he came back in his street clothing. Then\r\nwe went out to a second breakfast in a near-by café.\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned out to be a kindly little man, whose wife was now an\r\ninvalid. It was hard for him to talk English. Most of the Dutch had four\r\nlanguages, but only those who had lived in England spoke English well.\r\nThe difficulties, however, lessened as we nibbled brioches and sipped\r\ncoffee after coffee until noon. Warming to my narrative of the battle in\r\nthe United States, he shook his head when he thought of what I might\r\nhave to face in the future, and expressed more concern over my\r\npredicament and more heartfelt sympathy with my having had to leave the\r\nchildren behind than anybody I had yet met. He was the first person to\r\nwhom I had been able to overflow about my personal sadness.\r\n\r\nOn his part Dr. Rutgers described his hardships in keeping the clinics\r\nopen and, through the League, preventing adverse legislation.\r\nNeo-Malthusianism had never been popular anywhere, no matter what the\r\nproof in the lessening of human misery and suffering. Dr. Rutgers had\r\nborne alone the brunt of all the criticism directed at his society.\r\n\r\nThe Rutgers method for establishing new clinics had resulted in a sound\r\nsystem for dealing with the birth rate. The men and women who acted as\r\nhis councilors understood that a rising birth rate, no matter where in\r\nthe country, would soon be followed by a high infant mortality rate.\r\nAccordingly, they reported this quickly to the society, which sent a\r\nmidwife or practical nurse, trained in the technique standardized by Dr.\r\nRutgers, into the congested sector to set up a demonstration clinic. She\r\nusually took an apartment with two extra rooms, one for waiting, the\r\nother a modestly equipped office like that of any country midwife.\r\n\r\nHer duty was to go into the home where a child had died, inquire into\r\nthe cause, and give friendly advice regarding the mother’s own health.\r\nShe also encouraged her not to have another baby until the condition of\r\nignorance, poverty, or disease, whichever it might be, had either been\r\nbettered or eliminated. Whenever four had been born into such a family\r\nthis advice was made more emphatic.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Dr. Rutgers had explained his policy to me I had that most\r\nimportant answer to the puzzling and bothersome problem of the\r\nincreasing population in the Netherlands brought about by birth control.\r\nIt was proper spacing. The numbers in a family or the numbers in a\r\nnation might be increased just as long as the arrival of children was\r\nnot too rapid to permit those already born to be assured of livelihood\r\nand to become assimilated in the community.\r\n\r\nDr. Rutgers suggested I come to his clinic the next day and learn his\r\ntechnique. He was at the moment training two midwives preparatory to\r\nstarting a new center in the outskirts of the Hague. Under his tutelage\r\nI began to realize the necessity for individual instruction to patients\r\nif the method of contraception prescribed was to fulfill its function. I\r\nwondered at the ease with which this could be done. Very soon even I\r\nmyself, unable to talk to these women in their own tongue, instructed\r\nseventy-five.\r\n\r\nI used to bombard the little man with questions concerning each case. I\r\ntook issue with him over his autocratic system of dictating without\r\nexplanation. Merely saying, “This is what you do. Do this always,” had\r\nto my mind no educational value.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it would be a good idea to tell your patients what\r\nyou’re aiming at and why?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, can’t take time. They must do what they’re told.”\r\n\r\nHis was the doctor’s point of view with which I was familiar, but with\r\nwhich I could not agree.\r\n\r\nIt also seemed to me a mistake to regard the women merely as units in a\r\nsociological scheme for bettering the human race. On the file cards were\r\ninscribed only names and addresses; no case histories. I wanted to know\r\nso much more about them. How many children had they already had? How\r\nmany had they lost? What were their husbands’ wages? What was the\r\nspacing in each family, and what were the effects? How successful had\r\nbeen the method of contraception?\r\n\r\nIf this information had then been recorded, the birth control movement\r\ncould later have cited chapter and verse in its own support.\r\n\r\nAfter my morning’s work with Dr. Rutgers I usually repaired to the\r\nCentral Bureau of Statistics with my three-in-one translator,\r\ninterpreter, and guide. My findings were that in all cities and\r\ndistricts where clinics had been established the figures showed\r\nimprovement—labor conditions were better and children were going to\r\nschools, which had raised their educational standards. Professional\r\nprostitutes were few, and even these were German, French, Belgian, or\r\nEnglish, because Dutch women were encouraged to marry early. It made a\r\ndifference. From the eugenic standpoint there had been a rapid increase\r\nin the stature of the Dutch conscript as shown by army records. The data\r\nproved conclusively that a controlled birth rate was as beneficial as I\r\nhad imagined it might be, growing out of the first clinic initiated by\r\nthe enterprise of Dr. Aletta Jacobs.\r\n\r\nI was, of course, looking forward to meeting Dr. Jacobs, and sent her a\r\nnote asking for the privilege of an interview. A reply came, curt and\r\nblunt; she would not see me. She was not concerned with my studies or\r\nwith me, because it was a doctor’s subject and one in which laymen\r\nshould not interfere. Already I had come to the same conclusion in\r\nprinciple, but was dismayed at this first rebuff I had encountered. I\r\nwas also hurt as much as I could be hurt during that period when I\r\nseemed to be one mass of aches, physically and mentally. Not until much\r\nlater did I learn that to be a nurse was no recommendation in Europe,\r\nwhere she was more like an upper servant, a household drudge who took\r\ncare of the sick instead of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nFor two months I wandered about the Netherlands, visiting clinics and\r\nindependent nurses in the Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam. In spite of\r\nthe League propaganda against commercialization I found many shops in\r\nwhich a woman, if she so desired, could purchase contraceptive supplies\r\nas casually as you might buy a toothbrush. Unfortunately in some of them\r\nshe could be examined and fitted by saleswomen who had but little\r\ntraining in technique and scant knowledge of anatomy. Although the Dutch\r\nLeague had several thousand members—each one active, writing to papers,\r\ntalking to friends, attending meetings—and although fifty-four clinics\r\nwere in operation, many well-informed people did not know anything about\r\nthem. More surprising still, the medical profession as a whole appeared\r\nto be utterly ignorant of the directed birth control work that was going\r\non. It did not, therefore, seem extraordinary that no inkling of all\r\nthis—either clinics or contraceptive methods—had ever reached the United\r\nStates, and practically no attempt to copy it been made in England.\r\n\r\nEven in this neutral country signs of war were everywhere. Along the way\r\nwere soldiers in uniform, armed and keeping guard, and at the stations\r\nRed Cross wagons were in readiness. Feeling among the Dutch was greatly\r\nmixed: Queen Wilhelmina’s husband was a German; the army and the\r\naristocracy were for the Triple Alliance; the poorer classes were more\r\ninfluenced by the sufferings of the thousands and thousands of Belgians\r\nwho had flocked to Dutch firesides for food and shelter.\r\n\r\nNowhere else was I so impressed with the tragedies of war. Often about\r\nfour o’clock I had _kaffee klatch_ at the home of some Dutch lady who\r\nsat, very proper, while the maid served coffee, the best in Europe, from\r\nthe big, white, porcelain pot. I suspected most of the morning had been\r\nspent in supervising preparations for the delicious food.\r\n\r\nAt one of these afternoons I was introduced to five German delegates who\r\nhad come to attend the Women’s Peace Conference. They found it difficult\r\nto forgive the stories of German atrocities which England had allowed to\r\ncirculate. I ventured to inquire how they could disprove them,\r\nespecially in view of the report of the Bryce Commission. “Was not war\r\ncruel and savage, and might not these things have happened?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” one said, “but hundreds of our German boys are brought back\r\nto us, dead and alive, whose noses and ears have been cut off, put in\r\npackages, and taken to headquarters for reward. However, we would not\r\ndream of accusing the French or the English soldiers of such barbarisms.\r\nWe know that because their code forbids them to do these things\r\nthemselves they have called in the Moors and the Gurkhas and the savages\r\nfrom Africa.”\r\n\r\nUnable to comprehend how those towards whom they felt such friendliness\r\ncould return this sentiment with hatred, the women said to me in\r\nbewilderment, “Tell us really why people who do not know us hate us as\r\nthey do.” The dignity of their sorrow, the heavy burden of grief under\r\nwhich they labored, the very calmness and fairness with which they bore\r\nit, had a quieting effect.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands was the place to regain a certain sense of balance,\r\nespecially if you had passed through England, where feeling was so\r\nembittered. I overheard in Amsterdam a most illuminating conversation\r\nbetween two Englishmen and a German. After going over the pros and cons,\r\nthey shook hands all around, agreeing that six months after the War was\r\nsettled German and English trade would be hand in glove, trials and\r\ngrievances forgotten.\r\n\r\nTo go directly to France from the Netherlands was next to impossible;\r\nnor did I find it easy to travel roundabout by way of England, owing to\r\nthe recently instituted German submarine blockade. Then at last I heard\r\nthat a freighter was to be sent to London to test it. Day after day I\r\nwent to the docks for news, and employed the interval with pleasant\r\nsocial contacts.\r\n\r\nRather than have a cocktail before lunch or dinner the Dutch assembled\r\nat their favorite restaurants for apéritifs. The glass, with winged rim\r\nspreading out about half an inch from the top, was filled to overflowing\r\nwith Bols. You were not supposed to touch it at first; instead you\r\nleaned over and sort of scooped a little with your mouth before picking\r\nit up and enjoying it. The French apéritifs were pleasant and mild, but\r\nHolland gin was so strong and raw that I marveled at the way they could\r\ntake it with a smile. I was definitely unequal to the art.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was invited to play billiards with a Dutchman, an\r\nEnglishman, and a German. I accepted as naturally as for a game of\r\nwhist. Afterwards the Dutchman said that, though no respectable Dutch\r\nwife could have played billiards in that room without later being\r\napproached or insulted, an American woman could do anything and still\r\nnot lose caste. She minded her own affairs, paid her own bills, and even\r\nif she were seen on the streets late at night without an escort everyone\r\nknew she must be on legitimate business.\r\n\r\nThen the Englishman spoke to the same effect. He said you found the\r\nAmerican woman in all sorts of out-of-the-way and often questionable\r\nplaces, but you needed only to look into her candid face to find an\r\nanswer to what she was doing there. European women owed her a great deal\r\nfor her pioneering on the Continent. In England it was a common sight to\r\nsee the most estimable women smoking cigarettes in all fashionable\r\nrestaurants and hotels just as in America.\r\n\r\n“Just as in America!” I gasped, remembering my astonishment at having\r\nseen women smoke publicly in London. “I’m sure there must be some\r\nmistake. Ladies are not supposed to smoke in America. As an example to\r\nEurope they’re a failure, because they haven’t even won that liberty for\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThis was a surprise to them all. But the Dutchman rallied to the\r\ndefense, shifting the subject. “Nevertheless, she is the best-dressed\r\nwoman in the world.”\r\n\r\n“What about the Parisian?” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I except none. I have been over half the globe. I have paid particular\r\nattention to foreigners, their customs, their education, their tastes,\r\nand I have been convinced that today the Parisian woman has had to yield\r\nto the American in respect to clothes and fashion. Paris designs are\r\nintended for the United States, not for France or England. The\r\nFrenchwoman may be trim and neat and jaunty, but it takes a woman of\r\nwealth in France to be in the fashion, while in New York, every shopgirl\r\nwears cheap editions of the latest styles.”\r\n\r\nThe German was deep in thought during these speeches, resting his chin\r\nin his hand. Aroused by the striking of the clock he suddenly\r\ninterpolated, “Why, you can always tell an American couple in Europe.\r\nThe woman is too bossy, she leads the way, she does all the talking and\r\nordering, while the man trails on behind her and silently pays the\r\nbills.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must have seen him when he was on his good behavior,” I\r\nsuggested, “for at home he is not so silent about paying the bills.”\r\n\r\nUnabashed, the German continued, “My brother who has long lived in\r\nAmerica says the woman there is the head of the house, that she manages\r\nall; her word is law. Is this true?”\r\n\r\nHe seemed greatly disturbed, and I was about to reply, but the Briton\r\nrose to speak. “Of course she is, because she’s far superior. Why,\r\nAmerican men have nothing in common with the women. They are coarse,\r\nblunt, crude, while the women are finely sensitive, exquisite, and\r\ncourteous. The man has nothing to give his wife but money; he comes home\r\nat night and talks business, introduces into his home only friends who\r\nwill help him out financially, and when his wife discusses music, art,\r\nor literature, he falls asleep and snores. That’s why she brings her\r\nfortune into Europe for a husband. She finds her equal in the Frenchman,\r\nthe Italian, the Spaniard, but particularly in the Englishman. For every\r\nEnglishman is a gentleman, and every American woman is a lady!”\r\n\r\nThe German added a final convulsive note to the settlement of the woman\r\nproblem by adding, “Is it true the American husband not only washes the\r\ndishes but pushes the perambulator?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, he often does that.”\r\n\r\n“That is terr-r-r-rrible,” he answered, the r’s rolling out, and his\r\nhands clasped tight to his temples.\r\n\r\nAnd at that we all departed for our rest. But a few days later one or\r\nanother of the quartet was demonstrated right. News came that my boat\r\nwas about to leave at once, and I sought out the Captain. At the first\r\nintimation of my errand, he waved his hands and said, “No! No! No\r\nwomen!”\r\n\r\nI kept on talking until I made him admit he was interested in America,\r\nin diet, and in population. When I found he was a reader of _Physical\r\nCulture_ I produced my open sesame letter and again it was more potent\r\nthan a passport. I stood reasoning with him on the pier, until finally\r\nhe said, “There’s a rule to take no women. But you Americans are not\r\nlike others. I think I can put you in.” I was allowed to embark.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage we were most careful, anchoring at dusk, and when it\r\nwas light keeping sharp watch for floating mines which might have broken\r\nloose from their moorings. It took us two nights and a day to make a\r\ncrossing that ordinarily occupied only nine or ten hours.\r\n\r\nI had plenty of time to sort out my impressions and conclusions\r\nregarding the birth control movement. They had been revolutionized. I\r\ncould no longer look upon it as a struggle for free speech, because I\r\nnow realized that it involved much more than talks, books, or pamphlets.\r\nThese were not enough.\r\n\r\nPersonal instruction had been proved to be the best method, and I\r\nconcluded clinics were the proper places from which to disseminate\r\ninformation but also, admirable as they were in the Netherlands, they\r\nought not to be placed in the hands of unskilled midwives, social\r\nworkers, or even nurses. These could, of course, instruct after a\r\nfashion, but only doctors had the requisite knowledge of anatomy and\r\nphysiology and training in gynecology to examine properly and prescribe\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\nI had a new goal, but how difficult and how distant its attainment was\r\nto be I never dreamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Thirteen_\r\n\r\n                         THE PEASANTS ARE KINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nI stayed but a few days in London and then went on to Paris, a gloomy,\r\ngloomy city because so many people were garbed in black. Jaurès had been\r\nshot. The capital had already been moved to Bordeaux and suspicion and\r\nhysteria were in the air. When I went within easy driving distance of\r\nParis for lunch or dinner, I could see the barbed-wire entanglements and\r\ngaps where the trees had been taken down for better visibility.\r\n\r\nI renewed what contacts I could. But everybody was too busy now with the\r\nWar to think of such a subject as family limitation, which to the French\r\nhad never been anything to get excited about because they were too used\r\nto it. Furthermore, the other side of the question was now presenting\r\nitself. They were beginning to ask, “If we had a larger population,\r\ncould we not have held the Germans back?”\r\n\r\nAgain I saw Victor Dave. He was literally starving to death, supported\r\nonly by friendly gifts of a few francs here or there which he always\r\naccepted with laughter; what difference did it make to him whether he\r\nlived a few days longer? I never saw greater gallantry than was\r\nmanifested by his smile and the shrug of his shoulders as he sauntered\r\nto work with two pieces of dry bread in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe libraries were shut. Paris was no place for me, but I could see\r\nsomething of Spain, and Portet was waiting for me there. After the\r\ncustomary passport argument and some surprise at the cost of the\r\nsleeping-car arrangements I left for the South. It was four o’clock in\r\nthe morning as the express pulled into Cerbère, the station on the\r\nborder, where the French viewed all passengers with caution and\r\nmistrust.\r\n\r\n“Cerbère!” shouted the guard, and, “Passports!” shouted an inspector\r\nfollowing on his heels. Mine was not quite right. The train moved out\r\nleaving me and my baggage desolate on the platform. In the course of\r\nseveral interviews with various officials I made out that my passport\r\nlacked a particular signature, and Perpignan was the nearest town where\r\nit could be secured.\r\n\r\nI paced up and down the tiny station watching for the train back. As\r\nusual, peasants were asleep in the waiting room, some on the floor,\r\nothers sitting on bags and parcels. We were so close under the shadow of\r\nthe Pyrenees that they almost seemed to be toppling over us.\r\n\r\nFrom the train window I looked out on the beauty of dawn and the rising\r\nsun, a scene of such magnificence that it repaid me in pleasure for all\r\nthe trouble. To one side was the far stretch of the Mediterranean, as\r\nmagic a blue as I had ever imagined it. To the other were the majestic,\r\nrugged mountains with snow-capped peaks and bases covered with pink,\r\nflowering apricots. Little villages of white houses and red-tile roofs\r\nnestled in the valleys and serpentine roads coiled up the hillsides,\r\nwhere thousands of acres of grape vines, trim and well cared-for,\r\nbespoke the wine country.\r\n\r\nFrom Perpignan I telegraphed Portet, “Live or die, sink or swim, survive\r\nor perish, I’ll be in Barcelona tomorrow,” and boarded the train once\r\nmore with a light heart and my papers, three of them.\r\n\r\nAlready in the minute second-class compartment were a large, middle-aged\r\nwoman whose sweet face was framed in a black mantilla, a small\r\ngray-haired man, evidently her husband, and a younger one of about\r\ntwenty-five. It would have been crowded enough as it was, but they had\r\nbrought with them packages and bundles that filled the space to the\r\nroof. However, they squeezed out enough room for me to curl myself up\r\nand go to sleep.\r\n\r\nI awakened with a start, hearing again the fateful word, “Passports!”\r\nand found the agent examining those of my fellow passengers. I opened\r\nthe bag where I had always carried my credentials, but they were not\r\nthere. The officer stood waiting. “I have my papers all signed,” I said,\r\n“but I cannot find them. Go on to the others and when you come back I’ll\r\nhave them.”\r\n\r\nSince he could not understand English my speech had little effect; he\r\ncontinued to wait. I began turning things out—letters, books, pamphlets\r\nof all kinds and descriptions, groping through every bag, in and out of\r\nevery package. My traveling companions gazed on the commotion\r\nsympathetically and drew their legs aside so I could look under the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nAt this point another uniform approached and the two consulted together.\r\nThen one of them blew a whistle and at its loud and shrill summons five\r\nmen came running. The biggest of them threw wide the compartment door,\r\nto indicate I must get off. They were jabbering at me in French and\r\nSpanish; I was talking English. All of us were going as fast as we\r\ncould. First I jumped up and expostulated, then sat down and waved my\r\nhands saying, “Go away.”\r\n\r\nFinally there appeared a young Spanish student who could speak English.\r\nHe conveyed to me that the train was already late on my account; I must\r\nget off so the other passengers could catch the Barcelona Express.\r\n\r\nI would not be bothered any more. “So do I want to catch it,” I\r\nexclaimed. “Why don’t they move on? I have a passport and I’ll find it\r\nin a few minutes. I’ve paid for my ticket to Port Bou and I’m not going\r\nback. You can stop the train here for a week if you want to—I shan’t\r\nbudge!”\r\n\r\nThe gendarmes were standing expectantly on the platform below. The\r\ninterpreter shrugged his shoulders, “She’ll do as she says. She’s an\r\nAmerican woman and she’ll never come down. You might as well move on.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the big fellow with the long black cape resolutely seized\r\none bag after another and handed them out. Underneath the last one were\r\ndisclosed the missing papers. Straightway everybody was wreathed in\r\nsmiles. The bags were restored and the agents apologized, thanked me\r\nprofusely, and departed.\r\n\r\nThe passengers shook hands with me all around.\r\n\r\nJust before we reached Port Bou one of them peered out the window,\r\nrippled off some words to the others in Catalan. The whole compartment\r\nwas as though electrified. In a few seconds parcels were being torn\r\napart and boxes ripped open. The Señora removed her mantilla and placed\r\na smart new hat on her head, then crowned that with another, and\r\nanother, and another, until finally she was wearing four. Yards of\r\nbeautiful and exquisite lace went inside her bodice. She took off her\r\nouter skirt and swathed her hips in lengths of cloth. The men stuffed\r\ntheir pockets and the lining of their coats. At last there were only a\r\nfew rolls of braid left. The younger one lifted his trousers, wound them\r\nround and round his legs and tucked the ends in his garters. Then\r\nthrough the window went crumpled paper, boxes, string. Finally, as the\r\ntrain was slowing up they put on light-buff, linen dusters. My eyes\r\npopped out of my head to see these simple people suddenly transformed\r\ninto stylish stouts returning from Paris.\r\n\r\nThe two men nonchalantly smoked cigars as though nothing out of the way\r\nwere going on while the customs officials went through their bags.\r\nEverybody concerned knew they were merchants smuggling goods, but even\r\nthe authorities regarded it as legitimate for them to bring in as much\r\nas they could carry on their persons. As they left the shed where my\r\nbelongings were still being scrambled over, they glanced commiseratingly\r\nat me and glowered indignation at the officials that a lady should be so\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nI had expected to find in Barcelona street-corner Carmens with hibiscus\r\nblossoms in their hair, wandering guitarists and singers. But the only\r\nmusic that passed my window oozed out mechanically from two-wheeled,\r\nhighly-ornamented hurdy-gurdies. Nevertheless, the city was full of\r\ncolor. Strange little wagons with canvas covers, looking as though they\r\nwere part of a caravan, rattled over the cobbles. There was something\r\ngorgeously elegant about the members of the _Guardia Civil_, grandly\r\nmounted on Arabian horses, their mustachios fiercely bristling, their\r\nuniforms ablaze with scarlet and yellow topped off with black patent\r\nleather hats. The red Phrygian caps of the porters seemed almost too\r\nrealistic a reminder of revolution. The workers still wore their\r\ncrimson-fringed sashes, their blue French blouses, and white rope-soled\r\nshoes. The men, as a rule, were of slight frame, but conveyed an\r\nimpression of strength like steel rods; the women, invariably black-clad\r\nexcept for the very young, were fat and waddling.\r\n\r\nNumberless bells were constantly ringing in numberless churches.\r\nEverywhere, like crows, were priests in long swinging robes, shovel\r\nhats, and dirty bare toes sticking through their sandals. On the corners\r\nof the central streets I saw them occupying the booths of the\r\nprofessional correspondents who for ten cents read and answered letters\r\nfor the illiterate.\r\n\r\nAlthough Barcelona, capital of the separatist province of Catalonia, was\r\nthe progressive, industrial center of Spain, it was not darkened by a\r\nmêlée of belching chimneys. The hundreds of factories were kept out of\r\nsight, each one isolated in the fields, leaving the city free from\r\ntraffic, smoke, and the whir of machinery. The palms in the squares and\r\nparks were lovely, but set side by side with the new was the startling\r\nantiquity of the old town, congested and melancholy.\r\n\r\nOverlooking the sea at the end of the Rambla, decorated along its length\r\nwith flower stalls and trees, loud with birds, stood a tall column\r\nbearing the statue of Columbus. Around the base were scenes portraying\r\nvarious incidents of the voyage to America, each represented by small\r\nimages cast in bronze, all beautiful to the last detail. But the effect\r\nwas greatly spoiled because nearly every one remaining had a leg, arm,\r\nfoot, or even head gone. After looking at this for some time and\r\npondering over the wherefore, I concluded that figures so strongly made\r\nand set had not easily been removed, and decided it must have something\r\nto do with the Spanish-American War. When I asked my Spanish friends\r\nwhether I had guessed correctly, their only explanation was that\r\nruffians had doubtless done it for sport.\r\n\r\nHowever, after I had left the country I received verification of my\r\nsupposition. The monument had been stoned in ’98, but no Spaniard would\r\never have admitted this fact to any American; it might hurt the feelings\r\nof the visitor even to mention the unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nI began to study Spanish with a teacher, but I was not nearly far enough\r\nadvanced to be able to get anywhere in my investigations. Unfortunately\r\nalso, although men thronged the cafés in droves, they kept their wives\r\nin semi-Oriental seclusion and even mentally imposed their deep-rooted\r\nideas of the isolation of women on foreigners. I could not violate this\r\ncustom by going about alone, because I was a guest. As a result Portet,\r\nwho was a busy man himself, provided me with a succession of male\r\nescorts.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of a certain afternoon, tired and footsore, I was\r\nsitting with one of these accommodating gentlemen at a sidewalk table\r\nsipping an apéritif—a delicious French vermouth supplemented by olives\r\nstuffed with anchovies. Bootblacks were making their customary rounds of\r\nthe patrons, and the men were having their shoes cleaned. Since I had\r\nbeen walking about a great deal, mine were appearing rather scuffed, and\r\nI stretched my feet out.\r\n\r\nMy companion looked at me appealingly. “I beg of you, Señora, not here.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\nBut the boy had already brought his little shoe rest, begun spitting on\r\nmy oxford and rubbing with energy and enthusiasm. Embarrassed, my escort\r\nrose and moved away, but, interested in the boy’s novel methods, I kept\r\nmy eyes on my shoes and was unaware of anything out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had finished I glanced up. There must have been\r\ntwenty-five men gathered in front of the café, all looking fixedly and\r\nintently at this unusual spectacle. When I opened my purse to pay the\r\nboy, he doffed his cap with the most gracious gesture. “Señora, this is\r\nmy pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd outside applauded loudly and I felt my face growing hot. Not\r\nuntil they had drifted off did my protector return, wan and pale and\r\nextremely agitated. “You see what you’ve done, you see? It will be the\r\njoke of Spain! You are the friend of Professor Portet! It is a\r\nreflection on him and on his family! You cannot do these things!”\r\n\r\nI realized then that I had to be more circumspect.\r\n\r\nPortet, who after all was Ferrer’s successor, was watched wherever he\r\nwent by the secret service, and soon pointed out that I too had a\r\nshadow—the man who sat constantly at the little, round, marble-topped\r\ntable across from my hotel. He said I should always have this individual\r\nor one of his mates with me. They were on eight-hour duty, and if I were\r\nto go in for any night life I would have three separate ones over the\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThese government agents were to give a regular report of whom I was with\r\nand where I went, and, in a sense, they also looked after me, although\r\nPortet was never without a revolver in his pocket. In Spain a breath of\r\ndampness, and pop—open went the umbrellas all over the place. Once on\r\nthe way to a benefit for the Belgians Portet and I were waiting for the\r\ntram when a spatter of rain came up. His spy rushed to hold an umbrella\r\nover him while mine ran after my hat which the wind had saucily blown\r\noff my head. Or, if I were taking a train alone, my daytime attendant,\r\nhaving already been in conference with the hotel proprietor, would\r\nappear at the ticket office and explain to the clerk where I wanted to\r\ngo. Had he spoken English I would have doubtless enjoyed his\r\nconversation, but Portet warned me it was beneath my dignity even to nod\r\ngood morning to such a creature.\r\n\r\nThe frequent friendly attentions of our spies could not draw a word of\r\napproval from Portet, though on one occasion they performed a real\r\nservice. Stopping en route at the American Express Company to get some\r\nmoney, we set out to see a part of the old city new to me. Only a few\r\nblocks from the banks and modern shops were center pumps from which\r\nwomen were carrying the water to their homes in tall earthen jugs, in\r\njust the same primitive manner as centuries ago. The houses in the\r\nred-light district were approached by outside stairways along which were\r\nniches enclosing receptacles for holy water, and into these the patrons\r\ndipped their fingers religiously, crossed themselves, and entered.\r\n\r\nWhile we were walking through one of the narrow streets, high-walled on\r\neither side, suddenly and without reason I felt alarmed, and at the same\r\nmoment Portet put his hand in his pocket. I glanced behind to find our\r\ntwo familiar guarding shadows gone; I sensed danger ahead, but I, too,\r\ntried to act as though everything were all right, as though there were\r\nnothing to worry about. We strolled in the same leisurely way to the\r\ncorner. There in a flash down another street we caught a quick glimpse\r\nof struggling figures in the distance. In a moment they disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to our destination—a little café fronting the\r\nMediterranean. As we sat admiring it, I was startled by the sight of our\r\ntwo spies approaching, one of them holding a long, jagged-edged knife. I\r\ncould not understand his excited words, but his pantomime was so\r\ngraphically descriptive of a life-and-death struggle that my flesh began\r\nto creep and shivers ran up and down my backbone. He paused, bowed, and\r\nheld out the knife, obviously offering it to me.\r\n\r\nPortet, looking very incensed, pulled out his revolver, showed it to the\r\nman, and ordered him off. When both had retired, abashed, Portet\r\ntranslated briefly, “He says he has saved your life—that robbers saw you\r\nget money at the American Express this morning, and that he knew they\r\nwere going to attack you. He followed and grabbed the knife away from\r\nthem. I told him this was unnecessary. The thieves would have got as\r\ngood as they gave! I can take care of you.”\r\n\r\nI thought I ought at least to have given the man a reward, but not\r\nPortet, the revolutionary, who was furious at the presumption. He was\r\nalways angry at them. When he came to lunch with me Palm Sunday, the\r\nhotel proprietor leaned over the table confidentially and said, “The\r\ngovernment agent wishes to speak to you.”\r\n\r\nPortet shouted, “If he comes near, I’ll shoot him! The hound, the worm,\r\nthe dog! How dare he?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we find out what he wants?” I suggested.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor returned, “Nothing, Señor, except to ask whether you and\r\nthe Señora are attending the bullfight this afternoon. His time is up at\r\nfour o’clock, but if you are going to the _plaza de toros_, he will be\r\nglad to stay on duty another eight hours.”\r\n\r\nWe went; he came right along and saw the spectacle at government\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe cement-like benches of the large amphitheater were crowded to full\r\ncapacity. The people were gesticulating, chattering volubly as though\r\nawaiting something unusual or something good eagerly anticipated.\r\nOverhead the monotonous, gray sky seemed like a huge tent, it was so\r\nregular and colorless, but every little while a patch of blue appeared.\r\nThe disposition of the onlookers changed with the same unexpectedness\r\nfrom gladness and joy almost instantaneously into impatience or wrath;\r\nat one moment they clapped and praised the matador, at the next they\r\ninsulted and vilified him.\r\n\r\nMost of my Spanish friends hoped I would like a bullfight, although\r\nPortet, who thought it barbaric, told me it would probably shock me;\r\nevery foreigner who saw one simply shut his eyes in horror when some\r\npoor old skeleton horse was so gored that its intestines fell out and\r\nthen were pushed back for its re-entry into the arena. If I were going\r\nto be conspicuous by showing my feelings, the populace might turn upon\r\nme, and, jokingly, he suggested following the example of Alfonso XIII,\r\nwho had given his English bride a pair of opera glasses with perfectly\r\nblack lenses because she was so open and frank at displaying her\r\nemotions. She had stood and stared blankly at them all the time, and\r\nthus got through her first bullfight.\r\n\r\nI promised to be careful, and watched with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe bull came out snorting with passion and vigor, glaring around the\r\narena with a great noble sweep of his head. Suddenly he saw a color he\r\ndid not like, something inimical. He lunged towards it, and then a\r\nmedieval-looking figure danced before him with a cape to confuse him. He\r\nforgot his original enemy and rushed at the red thing. Another gyrating\r\nfigure distracted his attention and angered him to wheel towards the new\r\nadversary, make another plunge, and again be met by a flash of color.\r\n\r\nOver and over and over again this happened. The poor bull’s vitality was\r\nfinally worn down, not from direct combat, but because of the many\r\nbewildering forces that were there to destroy him—the fluttering capes,\r\nthe kaleidoscopic shapes, the swift-thrown banderillas, and the gleaming\r\nlances of the picadors. Then, when he was bleeding and utterly spent,\r\nthe hero stepped out with a sword to kill him. He was dragged out,\r\nsombreros whirled into the arena, shrieks and shouts arose, the band\r\nplayed, a great victory had been achieved.\r\n\r\nWithin no time, even before another bull appeared, vendors came along\r\nwith baskets of hot sandwiches made from the barbecued meat of the one\r\njust killed.\r\n\r\nNot a single word would Portet let me say until we were entirely out of\r\nhearing; you could talk freely in Spain against the Church or the\r\npriests, but this sacred institution must not be criticized. Passing\r\nthrough my mind was the thought that a bullfight was symbolic of the\r\nstruggle of the working classes. Strikes, picketing, jails exhausted\r\ntheir energy until they too charged blindly this way and that, always\r\nmissing the main issue.\r\n\r\nMany of my holidays were spent more happily than this. I never tired of\r\nthe wooded mountains which sheltered Barcelona, most of them having some\r\nreligious significance. Portet and I went up the funicular to the top of\r\nTibidabo, the exceeding high place where the devil tempted Jesus,\r\nshowing him in a moment of time the world spread out before him.\r\n\r\nAnother glorious spring day we twisted up the thirty miles of road to\r\nMontserrat, the mountain riven in two at the Crucifixion. It was the\r\nquaintest sight to one coming from a land of subways and elevators to\r\nwatch the donkeys laden with packs on their backs of vegetables, eggs,\r\nand butter, and to see their owners straggling beside up and down the\r\nhills, masters of at least themselves if not of their donkeys. The\r\nbreeze blew more chill as we ascended the final slope to the huge\r\nmonastery at the top. Afterwards night fell, and the moon shone over the\r\nhuge boulders of towering rocks, and the whispering wind swung from mass\r\nto mass and echoed back again whence it came. It was an evening of\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\nOn making other sorties into the country I perceived an innate\r\nintelligence in the most ignorant peasant. The average one could not\r\ntell the names of the simplest plants or flowers, but one look from the\r\neye, one tone of the voice, was comprehended in a flash. Even the gypsy\r\nchildren in the outskirts of Barcelona, with their little dirty feet and\r\ntattered clothing, who danced weird dances and flattered strangers for\r\npennies, had a natural brightness beyond belief.\r\n\r\nBut this intelligence was not being directed, and one reason was\r\ninherent in the rebellious nature of the Catalan; he would have\r\npreferred no system of government at all if that had been possible, for\r\nhe was restless and tumultuous under restraint.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw children leading the blind about the streets day after day, I\r\nasked, “Don’t they have to be in school? Isn’t education made compulsory\r\nby the Government?”\r\n\r\nI was laughed at. “If the Government sent our children to school, we\r\nwould know it was the wrong sort of school.”\r\n\r\nParents who could afford it, however, were willing enough to have them\r\ngo to Ferrer’s schools. Two thirds of the Spanish people had not been\r\nable to read or write before his time. The teacher, who worked\r\nconstantly all the year round, averaged about sixteen dollars a month.\r\n“He is hungrier than a schoolmaster” was a household axiom.\r\n\r\nSince Ferrer’s first school had opened fourteen years previously, some\r\nforty-six had begun to operate, and, in addition, most towns of any size\r\nhad at least one rationalist school which was maintained by the workers\r\nand also used Ferrer’s texts. The groundwork was then being laid for the\r\nchildren of yesterday to become the leaders in today’s fight. The pupils\r\nI saw at near-by Sabadella, at Granada, and at Seville, were being\r\ntaught the processes of life from the cell up, and their instructors\r\nwere really trying to give them a scientific instead of a theological\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nBecause of the long mental and physical isolation imposed upon them by\r\nthe Church, which controlled all education, five thousand towns and\r\nvillages could be reached only by trails and tracks. The Church had\r\nobjected to having roads built because, once transportation were made\r\nmore accessible, women could more easily leave their homes in the\r\ncountry and go to the city where evil awaited them—their morals were\r\nbeing safeguarded by cow-paths.\r\n\r\nMost of Spain was a gaunt, denuded, tragic country with vast, desolate\r\nsteppes and red, impoverished soil which gave the feeling it had been\r\nsoaked in human blood for centuries. Certainly the spilling of blood had\r\nbeen a matter of indifference in Spanish history. In a sense the whole\r\npeople were lawless, hostile to rulers. Every child knew the evils of El\r\nCaciquismo. Some Spaniard has said, “Democracy, Republicanism, or\r\nSocialism have in reality little to do in our country, for we do not\r\nwillingly accept either king, president, priest, or prophet.”\r\n\r\nThe worker in Catalonia had small faith in government, no matter what\r\nthe brand, and kept straight to the one issue—revolution through\r\neconomic action, chiefly the general strike. He did not look upon the\r\nGovernment as a vague, mysterious something for the deeds or blunders of\r\nwhich no one could be blamed; he demanded that those in authority should\r\ngive accounting for the results of their authority. He never forgot a\r\nwrong, and usually those responsible paid the bill. I sometimes thought\r\nhis “attempts” were carried out more from a spirit of revenge and\r\nindividual hatred than as a social protest.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Rambla was a great square, the Plaza de la\r\nConstitucion, and there each day from five to six the populace took its\r\nairing. Thousands of feet had so worn the pavement that it needed\r\nreplacement. One noon the square was torn up. Nobody could walk there\r\nfor twenty-four hours, the workmen were busy, ropes were placed across\r\nboth ends of the promenade, and a huge sign was erected, “No trespassing\r\nallowed. By Order of the Government.”\r\n\r\nLoiterers gathered to look at the proclamation. They began talking,\r\ntheir gestures growing more and more vehement, until finally they pulled\r\ndown the ropes and deliberately trod on the fresh concrete. They were\r\nnot going to be forbidden by the Government! The entire job had to be\r\ndone over again, and I noticed the next night six mounted police were\r\nguarding all four sides. But nobody seemed to give either incident the\r\nslightest attention.\r\n\r\nCatalans were a race of individualists, each a law unto himself. Their\r\nmost marked characteristics were independence and personal dignity. Even\r\nPepet, the waiter at my hotel, knew how to use his freedom. Sometimes he\r\ncalmly left the dining room and went down the street for a shave while\r\nwe were having our soup. He eventually returned for the following\r\ncourse, happy and clean, his absence unreproved.\r\n\r\nWhenever the conversation of the guests interested him, Pepet entered in\r\nquite as naturally as though he were sitting and being served instead of\r\nserving. In any other country this would have been resented as\r\ninsolence, but here every courtesy and respect was shown to him just as\r\nhe showed it to others. If you said you were going to go by a certain\r\ntram to a certain place to be there at three in the afternoon, he\r\ninterrupted, “Pardon me, Señora, you do not need to be there until\r\nfour-thirty, and it is much better to go by this other route.”\r\n\r\nLike the rest I said, “Right, Pepet, we shall take your advice.”\r\n\r\nWith the expulsion of the Jews from Spain vanished the driving force for\r\ncommercial initiative, a quality, fortunately or unfortunately, greatly\r\nlacking in the country. Pérez Galdós said:\r\n\r\n  The capital defect of the Spaniards of your time is that you live\r\n  exclusively the life of words, and the language is so beautiful that\r\n  the delight in the sweet sound of it woos you to sleep. You speak\r\n  too much. You lavish without stint a wealth of phrases to conceal\r\n  the poverty of your actions.\r\n\r\nI did not believe this entirely true, but without doubt the Spanish had\r\na maddening habit of procrastination. It was “Sí, Sí, Señora, assuredly,\r\ncertainly,” all gracious promising—and then nothing happening. To an\r\nAmerican this was especially aggravating, because he was always in a\r\nconstant hurry; he expected to see and know the whole of Spain in a\r\nmonth. But the Spaniard was not to be rushed. When asked what time it\r\nwas, he might reply, “Perhaps four hours more of the sun.”\r\n\r\nThis defiance of clocks and the absence of strain and bustle pleased me\r\npersonally. A story was told of a Spaniard going to seek his fortune in\r\nSouth America. After finding a position to his satisfaction he worked\r\nthree hours and then suddenly asked for his pay. When his employer\r\nrequested the cause of his abrupt leave-taking, he exclaimed angrily,\r\n“Do you think I’m going to spend all my life working for you?”\r\n\r\nDon Quixote truly represented the Spanish temperament. The strong\r\nenthusiasm which was shown for a project and the still stronger\r\nimagination which not only saw the matter begun but also finished, was\r\nSpanish to the last degree. The knight of La Mancha thought nothing of\r\ninvading cities and fighting giants, but it ended in thinking about it.\r\n“I consider all that already done.”\r\n\r\nSpanish character, so paradoxical, so attractive, and often so difficult\r\nto understand, fascinated me. I could exhaust myself in\r\nadjectives—fickle, impetuous, rich-souled, ascetic, passionate,\r\nrealistic, individualistic. Courtesy and ceremony were second nature to\r\nthe Catalans of Barcelona, supposed to be the most dangerous and lawless\r\ncity in Europe, where thousands of anarchists gathered and plotted and\r\nwhere bombs were thrown wrapped up in flowers.\r\n\r\nI remember how on the suburban trams going high into the mountains,\r\nsellers of hot and cold omelets ran up and down the station platforms.\r\nAnybody who bought one, before eating it himself, offered it to all the\r\npassengers in the car, even though they might be carrying their own\r\nlunches.\r\n\r\nTo accept, however, was a shocking breach of good form. The offerer\r\nprotested that you must take it, and you had to think fast for a\r\nplausible excuse. “My friends are waiting for me to dine with them,” or\r\n“I’ve just had something at the last station.” You must never, never,\r\nnever accept.\r\n\r\nHavelock used to tell of a grave error he had once made when traveling\r\nin Spain. When he had admired a piece of jewelry, the lady to whom it\r\nbelonged had removed it promptly and thrust it upon him, saying, “I am\r\nhonored to give it to you.” She had been so insistent that, though\r\nthoroughly uncomfortable, he had taken it—the very worst thing he could\r\nhave done. Soon it disappeared from his effects, but what was his\r\nsurprise on his next encounter with the lady to find her wearing it\r\nagain with no sign of discomposure. Her servants had been so indignant\r\nthat one of them had immediately stolen it back.\r\n\r\nSpanish men were not only courteous to women but also to each other,\r\nhaving no hesitancy at showing their regard and affection. Even the\r\nbeggars addressed each other in the most high-flown phrases, “Your\r\nHighness,” or “Your Grace.” One might ask, “Where is Your Excellency to\r\nsleep tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Under the bridge, My Lord.”\r\n\r\nThey lacked that poverty-in-the-soul look that existed in the same class\r\nin other countries. Assuming the condition of one tattered and ragged\r\nspecimen to be temporary, I questioned him, “What do you do ordinarily?”\r\n\r\n“I saunter, I idle, I loaf.”\r\n\r\n“But what work do you do?”\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up with the utmost hauteur, and said proudly, “I do not\r\nwork. I am a beggar.”\r\n\r\nDoing business with the Spaniards required a knowledge of finesse quite\r\nforeign to the average American. I, for example, saw a basket in a shop\r\nwindow which I felt I really must have. My escort and I went into the\r\nstore. Since the proprietor did not speak English, all I could do was\r\ngaze longingly, take it in my hand, and ask my companion, “How much do\r\nyou suppose this is?” He made no answer, but pointed to something else\r\non the wall, and we left without learning the price. I thought he was a\r\nterribly stupid person.\r\n\r\nThe next day I passed the same place with Portet, and I begged, “Oh, do\r\ncome in and ask how much that basket is. I want to buy it.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled at me indulgently. “You know in our country we cannot just go\r\ninto places and find out prices. This man is a craftsman. We will talk\r\nto him.”\r\n\r\nThe proprietor and his wife shook hands with us and brought the best\r\nwine from the cellar. Then the former said, “The Señora was here\r\nyesterday. Tell us about her.”\r\n\r\n“She comes from North America,” answered Portet.\r\n\r\n“Tell us about North America.”\r\n\r\nAfter forty minutes of this, during which I kept one eye on the wicker\r\ncontainer but was unable to divert the conversation to it, we said,\r\n“_Hasta la vista_,” and bowed our way out.\r\n\r\nA week later Portet and I, following the lodestone of my particular\r\nbasket, sought the shop once more. Relations had now been established,\r\nand we were entitled to ask about it. But we still could not demand\r\noutright, “How much does it cost?” We must say, “This basket must be\r\nworth so and so,” making the figure higher than it should be.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no, no, no!” the proprietor protested. “It is not worth that.\r\nMy humble hands fashioned it. It is hardly worth anything.”\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to make me accept it for nothing. I had to refuse and once\r\nmore try to make him take more than its value. Never was there such a\r\njuggling before we finally arrived at the exact amount of pesetas.\r\n\r\nOn my departure from the country I had to break through a similar\r\npunctilio. I spent about seven weeks in Barcelona and was never\r\npresented with a hotel bill—none for lodging, for laundry, for meals, or\r\nfor extras such as coffee. The day was coming when I must go back to\r\nFrance, and I did not want too much Spanish money with me—just enough to\r\ntake me to the border. From there I had already purchased my tickets for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nEach time I mentioned _cuenta_ to the proprietor, bowing and turning up\r\nhis palms he answered, “Sí, Sí, Señora,” until finally, on my last\r\nmorning, I marched resolutely up to the desk and said, “I shall miss my\r\ntrain if I have to go to the American Express to get more money. You\r\nreally must tell me how much I owe.”\r\n\r\nHe went upstairs. I waited. Finally he descended, his hair standing on\r\nend. He threw the reckoning down on the table with a most vindictive\r\nlook. I glanced at it. The total was very low; it could barely have\r\ncovered the cost of the food.\r\n\r\n“I have been humiliated!” he exclaimed dramatically.\r\n\r\n“Whatever is the matter?” I questioned.\r\n\r\n“We are living in the most hellish country on earth!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“A lady comes all the way from North America. She visits us, she stays\r\nhere, we like her, and I must present her with this sordid bill!”\r\n\r\nSome day when the fighting is over I shall return again to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Fourteen_\r\n\r\n                          O, TO BE IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached London it was spring, and beautiful as only spring in\r\nEngland can be. I longed to get out into the country and, through the\r\nkindness of Dr. Alice Vickery, was soon lodged in a private home in\r\nHampstead Gardens next door to her quaint, ivy-covered, red-brick house.\r\nIn the large garden in back we often had tea under the blossoming apple\r\ntrees. There, dressed in gray or purple, with white collar and a wisp of\r\nlace not quite a bonnet on her head, she entertained the young and\r\nmodern women of England who were working for reforms of no matter what\r\nkind. Still, at the age of eighty, she was alert upon all questions of\r\nthe day, busily engaged in writing leaflets or articles pointing out the\r\nweak spots in social programs.\r\n\r\nDr. Vickery was so full of the living side of Neo-Malthusianism that I\r\ncould ill afford to forego one possible hour with her. Often when we\r\nfound ourselves alone in her drawing room I sat at her feet and heard\r\nthe story of the pioneer Malthusians, what they had had to undergo, and\r\nwhat they had accomplished. For my benefit she brought out of her attic\r\na veritable treasure of the early days—old circulars, pamphlets, and\r\nletters now, I am afraid, destroyed.\r\n\r\nAlmost every afternoon, taking her walking stick and with Dr. Binnie\r\nDunlop for a companion, Dr. Vickery boarded the tram to attend some\r\ngathering. She had been one of the first to welcome the militant\r\nsuffragettes, and she never missed a suffrage meeting, nor, for that\r\nmatter, any other significant one on infant or maternal welfare,\r\neugenics, or public health. She always went with the definite purpose of\r\ngetting the audience down to fundamentals. In time she became a familiar\r\nfigure. As soon as she entered a hall you could feel those present\r\naligning themselves against her. They knew she was going to bring up a\r\ncontroversial subject that no one wanted discussed, such as birth\r\ncontrol. It was like casting a boulder into a nice quiet lake, but, with\r\nan unruffled exterior and grim determination, she invariably rose just\r\nthe same, asked the chairman to recognize her, and said her say on the\r\nFeminist side of the question. From the lips of this Victorian old lady\r\nit sounded strange to hear frank remarks about the importance of\r\nlimiting offspring. Dr. Dunlop, with Scotch determination, was also bent\r\non setting people straight; he followed her and expounded the medical\r\naspects of population.\r\n\r\nIn June Dr. Vickery asked me to tell my story to a group of her friends.\r\nAmong them was Edith How-Martyn, who had recently graduated from the\r\nLondon School of Economics. But already the zealous ardor of this small\r\nand slight person had landed her in jail for suffrage. She had now split\r\nfrom Mrs. Pankhurst, unable to subscribe to the militant policy.\r\n\r\nThe American woman is apt to say, “Anything I can do for you, let me\r\nknow,” and then go away, her conscience relieved. The Englishwoman\r\nstates definitely that she can get up a meeting, bring you in touch with\r\nso and so, give you money, or get money for you. Edith How-Martyn in her\r\nquiet manner said to me, “I think what you have told us today should\r\nhave a larger audience. Will you give a lecture if we arrange it for\r\nyou? We’ll do the donkey work; all you have to do is speak.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days the time and place were set. I was to appear in Fabian\r\nHall the following month under my own name.\r\n\r\nThe chairs in the auditorium were wooden and the interior was\r\nunheated—not like an American hall. The audience was quite different\r\nfrom the little Socialist gatherings of working women I had addressed at\r\nhome. The atrocious and hideous English hats gave it an intellectual and\r\nhighly respectable air. These representatives of nearly every social and\r\ncivic organization in London, had the rationalist attitude and preferred\r\nto listen to principles and theories. I told them what I had been trying\r\nto do through the _Woman Rebel_ and explained my private and personal\r\nconception of what Feminism should mean; that is, women should first\r\nfree themselves from biological slavery, which could best be\r\naccomplished through birth control. This was, generally speaking, the\r\nintroduction of the term into England.\r\n\r\nMany came up and talked to me afterwards, among them Marie Stopes, a\r\npaleontologist who had made a reputation with work on coal. Would I come\r\nto her home and discuss the book she was writing?\r\n\r\nOver the teacups I found her to have an open, frank manner that quite\r\nwon me. She took me into her confidence at once, stating her marriage\r\nhad been unconsummated, and for that reason she was securing an\r\nannulment. Her book, _Married Love_, was based largely on her own\r\nexperiences and the unhappiness that came to people from ignorance and\r\nlack of understanding in wedlock, and she hoped it would help others.\r\nShe was extremely interested in the correlation of marital success to\r\nbirth control knowledge, although she admitted she knew nothing about\r\nthe latter. Could I tell her exactly what methods were used and how? In\r\nspite of my belief that the Netherlands clinics could be improved upon,\r\nI was fired with fervor for the idea as such, and described them as I\r\nhad seen them.\r\n\r\nLater when I came back to the United States, I brought with me the\r\nmanuscript of _Married Love_, and tried every established publisher in\r\nNew York, receiving a rejection from each. Finally I induced Dr. William\r\nJ. Robinson to publish it under the auspices of his _Critic and Guide_,\r\na monthly magazine which took up many subjects the _Journal_ of the\r\nAmerican Medical Association would not touch. Unfortunately even here it\r\nhad to be expurgated. When I cabled Dr. Stopes I had a publisher in New\r\nYork, her new husband, H. V. Roe, financed an unabridged English edition\r\nwhich appeared simultaneously.\r\n\r\nNo one can underestimate the work Marie Stopes has done. Though her\r\nother books, _Radiant Motherhood_ and _Wise Parenthood_, were limited in\r\nvalue because they were based on limited personal experience, she has\r\nhandled sex knowledge with delicacy and wisdom, placing it in a modern,\r\npractical category. She started the first birth control clinic in\r\nEngland, but she was not a pioneer in the movement. Annie Besant, Dr.\r\nVickery, the Drysdales, and many others had plowed the ground and sown\r\nthe seed. It needed only a new voice, articulate and clear as hers, to\r\npush her into the front ranks of the movement, where she must have been\r\nmuch surprised to find herself.\r\n\r\nMany people went out of their way to be kind to me in those days. I was\r\noften asked to the home of E. P. C. Haynes, solicitor, writer on freedom\r\nof the press, and a fine adviser. Around his table, one of the grandest\r\nset anywhere in England, could usually be found a large group of\r\ndistinguished people. Among them was the American Civil War veteran,\r\nMajor G. P. Putnam, a dapper, lively, alert little publisher with a\r\nwhite mustache and cold blue eyes. He was conservative and formal, but\r\nat the same time a firebrand in his fashion and an enthusiast for\r\ncertain issues. Haynes had invited him to hear my views, and himself\r\nintroduced the subject of birth control. Thus I was enabled to pave the\r\nway for having G. P. Putnam’s Sons eventually take over the publication\r\nof _Married Love_ in this country, although not until 1931, through the\r\nMajor’s efforts, was the ban lifted which prohibited the importation of\r\nthe complete edition into the United States.\r\n\r\nHarold Cox, brilliant Member of Parliament and editor of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, was another delightful host at Old Kennards in Buckinghamshire.\r\nIn the _Review_ he was constantly helping to form an enlightened public\r\nopinion on birth control, having every argument at his finger tips and\r\nnever missing a chance to answer questions in the London _Times_.\r\n\r\nHugh and Janet de Selincourt’s place at Torrington, Sussex, where\r\nShelley was born, always was a haven of refuge. After five days’ work in\r\ntown I could come, tired and pent-up, for a week-end. I loved the joy\r\nand simplicity of the music there, the lighthearted conversation, and\r\ntea on the lawn. From there you saw English ivy climbing up to the\r\nthatched roof, and a pond, a small one, which had been converted into a\r\nswimming pool. The general impression was of shrubbery and old walls\r\nwith fruit trees trellised against them. Beyond the velvet green grass\r\nwere red tree roses, beautiful borders of pink lupins, and delphiniums,\r\nthe tallest and bluest I have ever seep, From the dining-room window the\r\neffect was that of a tapestry. I wanted some day to embody the rambling\r\nspirit of this home in one of my own.\r\n\r\nHere again laughter bound me to these people. We laughed and we laughed\r\nand we laughed. Whole days were spent in gaiety over the most absurd\r\nthings. Hugh could never quite accept me as a crusader; he went into\r\nroars of merriment whenever I mentioned the subject of population—it was\r\ntoo much for a woman in a yellow dress to bother about.\r\n\r\nBut many of my week-ends were spent in “bothering” about it. At Sunday\r\nafternoon labor meetings in London someone was always holding forth.\r\n“Here’s a chance for you to talk birth control,” Rose Witcop once urged.\r\n\r\nIt was an opportunity to reach working people and I agreed, but lunch of\r\nthat day found me trembling. Henry Sara, a young man but old in the ways\r\nof the speaker, noticed I was not eating or drinking and could hardly\r\nutter a word. “I say, what’s the idea of all this worry? What you must\r\nthink about is that everybody there comes merely to hear somebody or\r\nanybody. They’ve no notion what you’re going to say. Anything is all\r\nright with them. Get that in your mind and stop worrying.”\r\n\r\nHis friendly encouragement gave me a little more fortitude, but on the\r\nway to the hall Rose Witcop took me severely to task for the trembling,\r\nwhich I seemed unable to stop. “These are just plain people you’re going\r\nto speak to. It’s utter nonsense to be nervous about it.”\r\n\r\nWhen Rose stood up to introduce me, she began, “Comrades—” There was a\r\nlong pause. For the second time she tried in a less assured tone,\r\n“Comrades—” Another interval and a third time, in a voice so weak she\r\nherself could hardly hear it, she attempted, “Comrades—” Then, barely\r\nwhispering, “Excuse me,” she sat down. By comparison my speech was not\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nWriting at this time was a means of expression much easier than\r\nspeaking. I had not forgotten my subscribers to the _Woman Rebel_. I had\r\nto fulfill my obligations and supply something to take the place of the\r\nthree issues which I had been unable to furnish them. Therefore, I wrote\r\nthree pamphlets on methods of contraception in England, the Netherlands,\r\nand France respectively. Printing them cost me a considerable amount of\r\nmoney. My friends in Canada, knowing I was not affluent, now and then\r\nwhen they had a little windfall or unexpected dividend sent me small\r\nchecks of from five to ten pounds, saying, “To use for your work.” These\r\nhad come in quite often.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I had squeezed my pocketbook dry paying for the last\r\npamphlet; I had not another penny to buy stamps. Ten days had gone by,\r\nand I kept wishing something might come in to help me out. That morning\r\na letter arrived. I tore it apart and a money order dropped out.\r\nHurrying as fast as I could to the post office I received the cash,\r\nspent it all on stamps, and hastened back in the hope of getting the\r\nwhole edition off on the _Arabic_; in wartime sailings had to be\r\nconsidered. One batch of envelopes had already gone into the pillar box,\r\nand I was just finishing addressing and stamping the second lot when I\r\nheard the knocker on the door below clatter through the house. It had\r\nthe ring of authority and sounded so ominous that I felt it must have\r\nsomething to do with me.\r\n\r\nSure enough, in a few moments a bobby and a man in plain clothes\r\nappeared at my threshold. They asked whether I were the person who had\r\nbeen sending quantities of mail to a foreign address.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I admitted in a small voice, wondering what on earth was going to\r\nhappen now.\r\n\r\nThe bobby came closer, showed me an unopened envelope, and demanded\r\nsternly, “Did you post this?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“Madam, in England we never put His Majesty on upside down. We do not\r\nrepresent our King standing on his head. Will you please, in affixing\r\nyour stamps, pay attention to the customs of our country?”\r\n\r\nThe care with which I stuck on the remainder right side up delayed me so\r\nthat I barely made the _Arabic_. Only then did I have time to read the\r\nletter. I took it out of my bag, thinking how wonderful it was of my\r\nfriends to send me the money and how much good I had been able to do\r\nwith it. To my consternation and amazement it was not for my use, but to\r\nbuy gifts—certain books to be sent back as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe money was gone and the presents could not be purchased.\r\n\r\nAfter all this rush and pother the _Arabic_ was torpedoed and went down\r\nwith the entire two thousand pamphlets. I made another effort, this time\r\nsuccessfully completed, and shaped an article on Emerson, Thoreau, and\r\nHumphrey Noyes and the Oneida Community, about whom the English were\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had written to Canada apologizing and saying I expected\r\nshortly to be able to fulfill the commissions. I now had an opening\r\nahead of me for a career abroad. Portet’s publishing house in Barcelona\r\nwas closely allied with others in Paris. Through him I was offered the\r\njob of choosing appropriate books in English, which could be published\r\nin both French and Spanish, especially works that would be of help to\r\nwomen and labor. The salary was satisfactory, the job itself\r\ninteresting, and it gave promise of permanency as soon as the War should\r\nbe over. I had almost decided to take it, even selecting a little house\r\nin Versailles with sunny rooms and a garden for the children.\r\n\r\nThere was only one drawback—the subtle, persistent dread that something\r\nwas wrong with Peggy. Night after night her voice startled me from deep\r\nsleep and left me in a state of agitation until I received the next\r\nletter containing news that all was going well. I tried to dismiss this\r\nfear and would have it partially submerged, but always the same troubled\r\nvoice rang in my ears, “Mother, Mother, are you coming back?”\r\n\r\nOne definite though inexplicable experience kept puzzling me. As I\r\nunclosed my eyes in the morning, or even before I was completely awake,\r\nI became conscious of the number 6, as though that numeral were\r\nrepeating itself again and again in my drowsy mind. I often tried to fit\r\nit into some event of the day—six o’clock, sixpence, the price of tea,\r\nor anything else amusing, and as casual or silly as I could make up.\r\nThis I did to protect myself against the premonition which seemed at\r\nfirst to come upon me with the recurrence of this number. Later, like a\r\nleaf on a wall calendar, NOV. 6 stood out.\r\n\r\nWhen the publisher asked me to commit myself by signing a three-year\r\ncontract to stay in Paris, I said, “Yes, I will if you’ll guarantee to\r\nlock me up or send me to Africa or the North Pole until after November\r\n6th.”\r\n\r\n“Why November 6th?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, but I’m certain that something important is to occur on\r\nthat day, something different, and something which will affect my entire\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\nHe drew up our plans as of January 1st of the following year.\r\n\r\nEdith Ellis was lecturing in America, and by letter we arranged for her\r\nto bring back Peggy and Grant, because it appeared I might be staying\r\nfor some time. Then, since only Peggy seemed lonely and in need of her\r\nmother and Grant was happy in school, it was determined he should be\r\nleft there. Edith was to sail with Peggy on the _Lusitania_.\r\n\r\nWhen word was flashed that the liner had been torpedoed, I stood in the\r\nmiddle of the night in front of the Cunard office, scanning with horror\r\nthe mounting ranks of missing and dead. Not until two in the morning was\r\nthe list complete and could I breathe once more; neither Peggy’s nor\r\nEdith’s name was on it. Edith had received one of those slips warning\r\nprospective passengers that the ship might be blown up, and was one of\r\nthe few who had heeded the admonition and transferred to another boat.\r\nEven so, the thought of being responsible for Peggy had been too\r\nalarming and she had decided not to bring her.\r\n\r\nThe War had sent many Americans back from Europe and Bill had returned\r\nto New York. I had had a detailed letter from him describing the\r\nstirring events of the previous December. A man introducing himself as\r\nA. Heller had called upon him at his studio and requested a copy of\r\n_Family Limitation_, pleading that he was poor, had too large a family,\r\nand was a friend of mine. Bill said he was sorry but we had agreed that\r\nI was to carry on my work independently of him, and he did not even\r\nthink he had any of the pamphlets. However, the man’s story was so\r\npathetic that he rummaged around and by chance found one in the library\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\nA few days later Bill opened the door to a gray-haired, side-whiskered\r\nsix-footer who lost no time in announcing, “I am Mr. Comstock. I have a\r\nwarrant for your arrest on the grounds of circulating obscene\r\nliterature.” Accompanying him was the so-called Heller, who turned out\r\nto be Charles J. Bamberger, an agent of the New York Society for the\r\nSuppression of Vice. The three departed but Bill soon found himself in a\r\nrestaurant instead of the police station. When he protested that he\r\nwished to consult a lawyer without delay, Comstock, between mouthfuls of\r\nlunch, offered advice. “Young man, I want to act as a brother to you.\r\nLawyers are expensive and will only aggravate your case.” Here he patted\r\nBill on the shoulder. “Plead guilty to this charge, and I’ll ask for a\r\nsuspended sentence.”\r\n\r\nBill’s answer was that, though he had been in Europe when the pamphlet\r\nhad been written, he believed in the principles embodied in it, and\r\nthat, therefore, his own principles were at stake. He would not plead\r\nguilty. “You know as well as I do, Mr. Comstock, there’s nothing obscene\r\nin that pamphlet.”\r\n\r\n“Young man, I have been in this work for twenty years, and that leaflet\r\nis the worst thing I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\nThis sort of conversation went on all afternoon; Comstock even tried to\r\nbribe Bill to turn states’ evidence by disclosing my whereabouts. It was\r\nhis custom to arrive at the police station so late that his prisoner\r\ncould not communicate with a lawyer or bonding office and had to spend\r\nthe night in jail. He could then make a statement to the papers that his\r\ncaptive had been unable to secure bail.\r\n\r\nWhen Comstock and Bill at last reached the Yorkville Police Court and\r\nthe clerk had asked the latter how he wished to plead, Comstock spoke\r\nfor him, “He pleads guilty.”\r\n\r\n“I do not,” expostulated Bill. “I plead not guilty.”\r\n\r\nHe was arraigned and bail fixed at five hundred dollars, but he was\r\nobliged to spend thirty-six hours in jail before it could be procured.\r\n\r\nIn September I had word that, after several postponements, his trial had\r\nfinally come up before Justices McInerney, Herbert, and Salmon. He\r\nstarted to read his typewritten statement. “I admit that I broke the\r\nlaw, and yet I claim that in every real sense it is the law and not I\r\nthat is on trial here today.”\r\n\r\nJustice McInerney interrupted him. “You admit you are guilty, and all\r\nthis statement of yours is just opinions. I’m not going to have a lot of\r\nrigmarole on the record. We’ve no time to bother. This book is not only\r\nindecent but immoral. Its circulation is a menace to society. Too many\r\nwomen are going around advocating woman suffrage. If they would go\r\naround advocating bearing children we should be better off.\r\n\r\n“The statute gives you the privilege of being fined for this offense,\r\nbut I do not believe this should be so. A man, guilty as you are, ought\r\nto have no alternative from a prison sentence. One hundred and fifty\r\ndollars or thirty days in jail.”\r\n\r\n“Then I want to say to the court,” shouted Bill, leaning forward and\r\nraising his hand for greater emphasis, “that I would rather be in jail\r\nwith my self-respect than in your place without it!”\r\n\r\nAlthough he was convinced of the justice of my cause, this was the first\r\nand only copy of the pamphlet he had ever given out. It was one of\r\nlife’s sharpest ironies that, despite our separation, he should have\r\nbeen drawn into my battle, and go to prison for it.\r\n\r\nWhen I received Bill’s letter bearing this news, I tore across the lawn\r\nto Dr. Vickery’s. Dr. Drysdale happened to be there, and in his\r\nindignation his face became red and his hands were clenched. He tramped\r\nup and down the floor in a frenzy of rage that such a thing could be\r\ndone to any human being. I am still touched when I think of this mild,\r\ngentle person being moved to depths of anger over an injustice which did\r\nnot affect him personally.\r\n\r\nThe question before me was, “Should I go back?” As had gone Bill’s trial\r\nso would probably go my own. I did not want to sacrifice myself in a\r\nlost cause. I was young, and knew I should be used for something.\r\nTemporarily postponing my final answer to the publishing house, I\r\ndecided to return to the United States, but only long enough to survey\r\nthe situation, to gather up my children. I intended, if possible, to\r\ncome back to that little house in Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Fifteen_\r\n\r\n                        HIGH HANGS THE GAUNTLET\r\n\r\n                 “_Let God and man decree\r\n               Laws for themselves and not for me;\r\n               Their deeds I judge and much condemn\r\n               Yet when did I make laws for them?_”\r\n                                           A. E. HOUSMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of September, 1915, I set sail from Bordeaux, I remember how\r\ninterminable that voyage was across the dangerous, foggy Atlantic. The\r\nshadow of the _Lusitania_ hung over us. The ship was absolutely dark,\r\nand tension crackled in the very air. My own thoughts were black as the\r\nnight and the old nervousness, the nervousness that came with a queer\r\ngripping at the pit of the stomach, was upon me; a dread presentiment\r\nand a foreboding were with me almost incessantly.\r\n\r\nWhen I succeeded in snatching a few hours’ sleep I was startled out of\r\nunpleasant dreams. One of them was of attempting to struggle through a\r\ncrowded street against traffic; I was pushed to the curb and had to make\r\nmy way cautiously. The mechanical, automaton-like crowds were walking,\r\nwalking, walking, always in the opposite direction. Then suddenly in my\r\ndream the people turned into mice—thousands and thousands of them; they\r\neven smelled like mice. I awakened and had to open the porthole to rid\r\nthe room of that musty smell of mice.\r\n\r\nAt last the lights of Staten Island, winking like specters in the dim\r\ndawn, signaled our safe arrival at quarantine. As the ship sidled along\r\nthe wharf at West Fourteenth Street on that gray October morning, a new\r\nexhilaration, a new hope arose in my heart.\r\n\r\nTo see American faces again after the unutterable despair of Europe, to\r\nsense the rough democracy of the porters and of the good-hearted,\r\nhard-boiled taxi-drivers; to breathe in the crisp, electric autumn air\r\nof home—all these brought with them an irresistible gladness. Because I\r\nwanted the feeling to linger, I refused a taxi, picked up my small bag,\r\nand walked away from the pier, looking about.\r\n\r\nAt the first news stand I passed I caught sight of the words, “What\r\nShall We Do About Birth Control?” on the cover of the _Pictorial\r\nReview_. It seemed strange to be greeted, not by friends or relatives,\r\nbut by a phrase of your own carried on a magazine. I purchased it and,\r\nsinging to myself, went on to a hotel where the children were brought to\r\nme. I cannot describe the joy of being reunited with them.\r\n\r\nThat evening I sat down at my desk and wrote several letters. I notified\r\nJudge Hazel and Assistant District Attorney Content that I was now back\r\nand ready for trial, and inquired whether the indictments of the\r\nprevious year were still pending; I was politely informed that they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nA note more difficult to compose went to the National Birth Control\r\nLeague, which had been re-organized in my absence under the leadership\r\nof Mary Ware Dennett, Clara Stillman, and Anita Block. To it had been\r\nturned over all my files, including the list of subscribers to the\r\n_Woman Rebel_. I asked them what moral support I could expect from the\r\nLeague, saying this would help to determine the length of my stay.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stillman, the secretary, invited me to call a few days later at her\r\nhome, where an executive meeting was to convene. I went with keen\r\nanticipation, totally unprepared for the actual answer. The committee\r\nhad met. Mrs. Dennett, Mrs. Stillman, and Anita were all there. Mrs.\r\nDennett spoke for the group; the National Birth Control League disagreed\r\nwith my methods, my tactics, with everything I had done. Such an\r\norganization as theirs, the function of which was primarily to change\r\nthe laws in an orderly and proper manner, could not logically sanction\r\nanyone who had broken those laws.\r\n\r\nAfter delivering this ultimatum, Mrs. Dennett walked to the door with\r\nme. Would I mind giving her the names and addresses of those socially\r\nprominent and distinguished persons I had found on my European trip to\r\nbe interested? Heartsick as I was over my reception, I was also amused\r\nat her shrewdness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dennett was a good promoter and experienced campaigner, a capable\r\noffice executive, an indefatigable worker for suffrage and peace, with a\r\nbackground that might have been invaluable. I often regretted that we\r\ncould not have combined our efforts. Had we been able to do so the\r\nmovement might have been pushed many years ahead.\r\n\r\nMy fourth communication was to Dr. William J. Robinson, an émigré from\r\nthe land of orthodox medicine, who was possessed of a sensitivity to\r\ncurrent moods. When he had realized that Will Durant’s lectures had\r\naroused interest in sex psychology, he had stepped in to speak to larger\r\naudiences, using a more popular approach, although, as far as I know, he\r\nhad never publicly discussed the prevention of conception.\r\n\r\nDr. Abraham Jacoby, beloved dean of the profession, in accepting the\r\npresidency of the Academy of Medicine, had backed birth control, and\r\nthrough Dr. Robinson’s endeavors a small committee had later been formed\r\nto look into it. From the reports that had come to me I could not\r\ndiscover whether any harmonious agreement that the subject lay within\r\nthe province of medicine had been made. To my inquiry Dr. Robinson\r\nreplied that the committee had met only once and he considered I could\r\nexpect no support from them. He enclosed a check for ten dollars towards\r\nthe expenses of my trial.\r\n\r\nHere were two disappointments to face. Both these organizations had\r\nseemed so well suited to continue progress: one to change the laws, the\r\nother to take proper medical charge. Neither had fulfilled my hopes and\r\ntherefore I felt I had to enter the fray again. My burning concern for\r\nthe thousands of women who went unregarded could apparently find no\r\nofficial endorsement; birth control was back again where it had started.\r\nI was convinced I had to depend solely upon the compassionate insight of\r\nintelligent women, which I was certain was latent and could be aroused.\r\n\r\nBut these problems were suddenly swept aside by a crisis of a more\r\nintimate nature, a tragedy about which I find myself still unable to\r\nwrite, though so many years have passed.\r\n\r\nA few days after my arrival Peggy was taken ill with pneumonia. When Mr.\r\nContent telephoned to say I had better come down and talk it over, I\r\ncould not go. He was extremely kind, assuring me there was no hurry and\r\nhe would postpone the trial until I was free. This allowed me to devote\r\nmy whole attention and time to her.\r\n\r\nPeggy died the morning of November 6, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe joy in the fullness of life went out of it then and has never quite\r\nreturned. Deep in the hidden realm of my consciousness my little girl\r\nhas continued to live, and in that strange, mysterious place where\r\nreality and imagination meet, she has grown up to womanhood. There she\r\nleads an ideal existence untouched by harsh actuality and disillusion.\r\n\r\nMen and women from all classes, from nearly every city in America,\r\npoured upon me their sympathy. Money for my trial came beyond my\r\nunderstanding—not large amounts, but large for the senders—from miners\r\nof West Virginia and lumbermen of the North Woods. Some had walked five\r\nmiles to read _Family Limitation_; others had had it copied for them.\r\nWomen wrote of children dead a quarter of a century for whom they were\r\nstill secretly mourning, and sent me pictures and locks of hair of their\r\nown dead babies. I had never fully realized until then that the loss of\r\na child remains unforgotten to every mother during her lifetime.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion had been focused on Comstock’s activities by Bill’s\r\nsentence, and the liberals had been aroused. Committees of two and three\r\ncame to request me to take up the purely legislative task of changing\r\nthe Federal law. Aid would be forthcoming—special trains to Congress,\r\ninvestigations, commissions, and victory in sight before the year was\r\nover! It was tempting. It seemed so feasible on the surface, so much\r\neasier than agonizing delays through the courts. Many others advised me\r\njust as before that in pleading guilty I was choosing the best field in\r\nwhich to make my fight.\r\n\r\nOne of those to urge me towards a middle course was Max Eastman, who\r\npossessed an unusual evenness of temper and tolerance towards all who\r\nopposed him as well as a keen mind and keen imagination which followed\r\nhypotheses to logical conclusions. This soft-voiced, lethargic poet,\r\nmentally and emotionally controlled, had too great a sense of humor and\r\nability in visualizing events in their proper perspective to advocate\r\ndirect action.\r\n\r\nMax made an appointment for me to see Samuel Untermyer, authority on\r\nconstitutional law and a person to whom liberals turned because of the\r\nfight he had put up against the trusts; he might straighten out the\r\nlegal aspects. I found him enthroned in his luxurious office amid the\r\nmost magnificent American Beauty roses—dozens and dozens and dozens.\r\nWith his piercing eyes and head too large for his frame, he appeared a\r\ndisembodied brain. Though the appointment had been made with\r\ndifficulty—writing and telephoning back and forth through secretaries to\r\nbe verified—time now was nothing to him. He was so smooth, so courteous,\r\nso sympathetic, so unhurried; he seemed to understand and to be ready to\r\nlift the load of legal worry from my mind.\r\n\r\nPicking up the telephone, he said, “Get me Mr. Content.” Then, “Harold,\r\ncome on over to my office and bring your record on Mrs. Sanger.”\r\n\r\nWhen the District Attorney had arrived, Mr. Untermyer’s whole voice\r\nchanged. He spoke sternly to the young man. “Why, Harold, what are you\r\ntrying to do—persecuting this little woman, so frail and so delicate,\r\nthe mother of a family? You don’t want to put her behind bars, do you?\r\nShe’s doing a noble work in the world and here you are behaving like\r\nthis! Are you representing the Government or are you merely prejudiced\r\nin your own behalf?”\r\n\r\nMr. Content replied respectfully, “Well, Mr. Untermyer, we don’t want to\r\nprosecute Mrs. Sanger, but we want her to promise to obey the law.”\r\n\r\n“Has she broken the law?”\r\n\r\n“We have positive proof that she has violated it on a very large scale.”\r\n\r\nMr. Untermyer immediately assured him, “Why, of course, she’ll promise\r\nnot to break any more laws. Is that all it is? You just quash that\r\nindictment and forget about it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Content left. Mr. Untermyer turned to me genially and said, “Well,\r\nyou see? We’ve fixed that up.”\r\n\r\n“What’s going to happen? The law will be the same, won’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes.”\r\n\r\n“What was that you said about a promise?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, write me a letter saying you won’t break the law again.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t promise that, Mr. Untermyer.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“No, I couldn’t do that. The law is there. Something must happen to it.”\r\n\r\n“The law may not be what it should be, but you’ll never get anywhere by\r\nviolating it. It must be changed by legal methods; gather all your\r\nfriends and go to Congress.”\r\n\r\nAgain I stated my position. The law specified obscenity, and I had done\r\nnothing obscene. I even had the best of the Government as regarded the\r\nprecise charge. I had not given contraceptive information in the _Woman\r\nRebel_, and therefore had not violated the law either in spirit or\r\nprinciple. But I had done so in circulating _Family Limitation_, and\r\nthat would inevitably be brought up. I really wanted this, so that birth\r\ncontrol would be defined once and for all as either obscene or not\r\nobscene.\r\n\r\nMr. Untermyer took down one of his ponderous books and read over the\r\nsection in question. Again he said, “The evidence is that you have\r\nviolated the law. We don’t separate the spirit from the letter. It is\r\nall there. It seems to me that pleading guilty would let you out of your\r\ntroubles without loss of dignity. You should consider yourself fortunate\r\nat the suggested outcome. You can gain nothing by trial. You cannot even\r\nget publicity in these days when the papers are crowded with war news\r\nand the big events of history are happening.”\r\n\r\nI still could not admit his interpretation. You had to differentiate\r\nbetween the things mentioned in that law and actual obscenity; the\r\ncourts would some day have to decide on this.\r\n\r\n“You have no case,” Mr. Untermyer persisted. “If you have broken the\r\nlaw, there is nothing anyone can do or say to argue that fact away. We\r\nmust prevent your going to jail, however. I’ll see what I can do.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not concerned with going to jail. Going in or staying out has\r\nnothing to do with it. The question at stake is whether I have or have\r\nnot done something obscene. If I have done nothing obscene I cannot\r\nplead guilty.”\r\n\r\nMr. Untermyer was upset. Instead of his former warmth I was aware of a\r\ncurt and cold politeness. I went from his office feeling I had had an\r\nopportunity to make a powerful friend and had lost it by refusing to\r\naccept the legal point of view.\r\n\r\nMax also was decidedly angry. His attitude was, “We tried to help you,\r\nand you declined help.” He wrote formally:\r\n\r\n  You could accompany your plea of guilty with a statement, both\r\n  before the Court and for the press, which would make it a far more\r\n  signal attack upon the law to whose violation you would be pleading\r\n  guilty than a plea of not guilty. It would do a thousand times more\r\n  good. At the same time it would satisfy your pride, or your feeling\r\n  that you ought to be brave enough to stand up for what you think, or\r\n  whatever it is that is making you refuse the advice of counsel.\r\n\r\nI would not plead guilty on any count. They could not make me. I felt\r\ndeep within me that I was right and they were wrong. I still had that\r\nnaïve trust that when the facts were known, the Government would not\r\nwilfully condemn millions of women to death, misery, or abortion which\r\nleft them physically damaged and spiritually crippled.\r\n\r\nClarence Darrow and other liberal lawyers from various cities generously\r\noffered to come to New York to present the case free of charge, but\r\nafter my Untermyer interview I was convinced that the quibbles of\r\nlawyers inevitably beclouded the fundamental issues; I had to move\r\npeople and persuade them emotionally. I had no practice in public\r\nspeaking; mine was the valor of faith. However, I was certain that\r\nspeaking from the fullness of my heart I would be guided by the\r\ngreatness and profundity of my conviction. In spite of the old adage\r\nthat “he who has himself for a lawyer has a fool for a client,” I was\r\nconfident that any jury of honest men would acquit me.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Content to put my case on the calendar as soon as possible.\r\nIt was called for the end of November, then set for January 18th, then\r\nJanuary 24th. I used to go almost weekly to demand that it take place,\r\nalways stressing the fact that I wanted a trial by jury. One of the\r\njudges that I came before in these various courts had previously asked\r\nme in a personal letter to send him _Family Limitation_, and I had\r\nmailed it to him with my compliments. The twinkle in his eyes was\r\nreflected in mine; we both knew that he as well as I had been\r\ntechnically breaking the law.\r\n\r\nAs the New York _Sun_ commented, “The Sanger case presents the anomaly\r\nof a prosecutor loath to prosecute and a defendant anxious to be tried.”\r\nThe newspapers were taking ever-increasing notice. A photograph of\r\nmyself and my two young sons circulated widely and seemed to alter the\r\nattitude of a heretofore cynical public. At that time I thought the\r\npapers were against me, but looking over these old clippings today I\r\nrealize this was merely the impersonality of the news columns. Their\r\neditorial hesitancy made them appear, like all other conservative and\r\nreactionary forces, my opponents. But the rank and file of American\r\nnewspaperdom, though they must always have their little jokes, have\r\nalways been sympathetic.\r\n\r\nThey printed the letter to Woodrow Wilson, initiated by Marie Stopes. It\r\n“begged to call the attention” of the President to the fact that I was\r\nin danger of criminal prosecution for circulating a pamphlet on birth\r\ncontrol, which was allowed in every civilized country except the United\r\nStates; that England had passed through the phase of prohibiting this\r\nsubject a generation before; and that to suppress serious and\r\ndisinterested opinion on anything so important was detrimental to human\r\nprogress. It respectfully urged the President to exert his powerful\r\ninfluence in behalf of free speech and the betterment of the race. This\r\nletter was invaluable by reason of its signatories—Lena Ashwell, William\r\nArcher, Percy Ames, Aylmer Maude, M. C. Stopes, Arnold Bennett, Edward\r\nCarpenter, Gilbert Murray, and H. G. Wells, whose name was news. If a\r\ngroup of such eminence in England could afford to stand by me, then the\r\nsame kind of people here might be less timorous.\r\n\r\nAs public sentiment grew, telegrams and letters showered upon Judge\r\nClayton demanding the dismissal of the charges against me. He piled them\r\nin wastebaskets and remarked in a bored tone to Mr. Content, “Take these\r\nSanger letters away.” That I was preparing to go to court undefended by\r\ncounsel was making the matter harder for them.\r\n\r\nMy radical allies were, according to their habit, collecting money for\r\nmy defense, but this had no effect on my private financial status. My\r\nsister, Ethel, who was living with me, thought I ought to be considering\r\nthe matter. One day she said, “I’ve a good case for you. Wouldn’t you\r\nlike to take it?”\r\n\r\n“What kind?”\r\n\r\n“Maternity. She expects to be delivered in a day or two—probably a\r\nCaesarian. She asked for me, but I’d rather you had it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not interested, thank you. I’ve given up nursing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Sanger,” she remarked ironically, “would you mind telling me\r\nwhat you’re going to do to earn your living?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not interested in earning my living. I’ve cast myself upon the\r\nuniverse and it will take care of me.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me sadly and with worried apprehension.\r\n\r\nThree days later Ethel received the anticipated summons. On her way out\r\nshe picked up the mail at the door. In it was a letter from a California\r\nacquaintance of hers who did not know where I was but had her address.\r\n“Will you please give the enclosed forty-five dollars to Margaret Sanger\r\nfrom her sympathizers?”\r\n\r\nEthel handed it to me with the resigned comment, “Well, here’s your\r\ncheck from God.”\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Woman Rebel_ had struck her single match of defiance,\r\nbut she could be of slight significance in the forward march towards\r\n“women’s rights.” In Feminist circles I was little known. With my\r\npersonal sorrow, my manifold domestic duties, my social shyness, I\r\navoided meeting new people. My attitude thus created some reluctance\r\namong those who might otherwise have hastened to my aid. Indeed, I\r\nwanted a certain type of support, but I could not take the initiative in\r\nasking for it.\r\n\r\nThis was suddenly done for me. One afternoon I was invited to a tea\r\narranged by Henrietta Rodman, Feminist of Feminists, in her Greenwich\r\nVillage apartment. Wells was particularly sanctified among her group and\r\nI must be all right if he approved. As a result of that meeting the\r\nsuffrage worker, Alice Carpenter, set the wheels in motion for a dinner\r\nat the Brevoort Hotel to be held January 23rd, the evening preceding my\r\ntrial. I was to be given a chance to say my say, speak my piece before a\r\ngathering of influential people. Although I did not see her until some\r\nyears after, I thanked her in my heart many times for what she had done.\r\n\r\nIn the ballroom were collected several hundred people. Mary Heaton\r\nVorse, Dr. Mary Halton, Jack Reed, Dr. Robinson, Frances Brooks\r\nAckerman, Walter Lippmann, then of the _New Republic_, and Mrs. Thomas\r\nHepburn, the Kathy Houghton of my Corning childhood, all were there.\r\n\r\nAs we were about to go in to dinner, Rose Pastor Stokes, the Chairman,\r\ntook me aside and said, “Something very disturbing has happened. We’ve\r\njust been talking to Dr. Jacoby. He has a speech ready in which he\r\nintends to blast you to the skies for interfering in what should be a\r\nstrictly medical matter. Remember he’s greatly admired and he’s speaking\r\nhere tonight for the doctors. We meant to have you come at the end of\r\nthe program but now we’re going to put you first so that you can spike\r\nhis guns.”\r\n\r\nMy trepidation was increased. Nevertheless, I plunged into my carefully\r\nprepared maiden speech in behalf of birth control. Fortunately I had\r\nalready planned to upbraid the doctors who daily saw the conditions\r\nwhich had so moved me and yet made it necessary for a person like\r\nmyself, not equipped as they were, to stir up public opinion. It was\r\nlike carrying coals to Newcastle; they should have been teaching me.\r\n\r\nI said I recognized that many of those before me of diverse outlooks and\r\ntemperaments would support birth control propaganda if carried out in\r\nwhat they regarded as a safe and sane manner, although they did not\r\ncountenance the methods I had been following in my attempt to arouse\r\nworking women to the fact that having a child was a supreme\r\nresponsibility. There was nothing new or radical in birth control, which\r\nAristotle and Plato as well as many modern thinkers had demonstrated.\r\nBut the ideas of wise men and scientists were sterile and did not affect\r\nthe tremendous facts of life among the disinherited. All the while their\r\ndiscussions had been proceeding, the people themselves had been and\r\nstill were blindly, desperately, practicing birth control by the most\r\nbarbaric methods—infanticide, abortion, and other crude ways. I might\r\nhave taken up a policy of safety, sanity, and conservatism—but would I\r\nhave secured a hearing? Admittedly physicians and scientists had far\r\nmore technical knowledge than I, but I had found myself in the position\r\nof one who had discovered a house was on fire and it was up to me to\r\nshout out the warning. Afterwards others, more experienced in executive\r\norganization, could gather together and direct all the sympathy and\r\ninterest which had been aroused. Only in this way could I be vindicated.\r\n\r\nSince my charge had forestalled his, the venerable Dr. Jacoby either had\r\nto answer me or shift his ground. He chose the latter course and talked\r\non the question of quality in population, which might perhaps have been\r\nconstrued as in my favor.\r\n\r\nMany of the women present were comfortable examples of the manner in\r\nwhich birth control could enable them to lead dignified lives. Elsie\r\nClews Parsons made the suggestion that twenty-five who had practiced it\r\nshould rise in court with me and plead guilty before the law. But only\r\none volunteered. What surprised me most was the voice of Mary Ware\r\nDennett announcing that she represented the National Birth Control\r\nLeague and that that body was going to stand behind Margaret Sanger in\r\nher ordeal—subscriptions were urgently needed for the League.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when I arrived at nine o’clock at the Federal Court\r\nbuilding more than two hundred partisans were already in the corridors.\r\nA great corps of reporters and photographers was on hand. The stage had\r\nbeen set for an exciting drama.\r\n\r\nJudge Henry D. Clayton and Assistant District Attorneys Knox and Content\r\narrived at ten-thirty, apparently feeling the effects of the publicity\r\nof the night before.\r\n\r\nThe moment Knox moved to adjourn for a week I was on my feet asking\r\nimmediate trial, but Judge Clayton postponed the case. Everybody went\r\nhome disappointed.\r\n\r\nFebruary 18th the Government finally entered a nolle prosequi. Content\r\nexplained there had been many assertions that the defendant was the\r\nvictim of persecution, and that had never been the intent of the Federal\r\nauthorities. “The case had been laid before the grand jurors as\r\nimpartially as possible and since they had voted an indictment there was\r\nnothing that the District Attorney could do but prosecute. Now, however,\r\nas it was realized that the indictment was two years old, and that Mrs.\r\nSanger was not a disorderly person and did not make a practice of\r\npublishing such articles, the Government had considered there was reason\r\nfor considerable doubt.”\r\n\r\nWell, when an army marches up the hill and then marches down again some\r\ngood excuse must always be given.\r\n\r\nAll my friends regarded the quashing of the Federal indictment a great\r\nachievement. There was much rejoicing and congratulation, but they acted\r\nas though they were saying, “Now settle down in your domestic corner,\r\ntake your husband back, care for your children, behave yourself, and no\r\nmore of this nonsense. Your duty is to do the thing you are able to do\r\nwhich is mind your home and not attempt something others can do better\r\nthan you.”\r\n\r\nBut I was not content to have a Liberty Dinner and jubilate. I could not\r\nconsider anything more than a moral victory had been attained. The law\r\nhad not been tested. I agreed with the loyal _Globe_, which staunchly\r\nmaintained, “If the matter Mrs. Sanger sent through the mails was\r\nobscene two years ago, it is still obscene.” I knew and felt\r\ninstinctively the danger of having a privilege under a law rather than a\r\nright. I could not yet afford to breathe a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nThe Federal law concerned only printed literature. My own pamphlet had\r\ngiven the impression that the printed word was the best way to inform\r\nwomen, but the practical course of contraceptive technique I had taken\r\nin the Netherlands had shown me that one woman was so different from\r\nanother in structure that each needed particular information applied to\r\nherself as an individual. Books and leaflets, therefore, should be of\r\nsecondary importance. The public health way was through personal\r\ninstruction in clinics.\r\n\r\nA light had been kindled; so many invitations to address meetings in\r\nvarious cities and towns were sent me that I was not able to accept them\r\nall but agreed to as many as I could. It was no longer to be only a free\r\nspeech movement, and I wanted also if possible to present this new idea\r\nof clinics to the country. If I could start them, other organizations\r\nand even hospitals might do the same. I had a vision of a\r\n“chain”—thousands of them in every center of America, staffed with\r\nspecialists putting the subject on a modern scientific basis through\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nMany states in the West had already granted woman suffrage. Having\r\nachieved this type of freedom, I was sure they would receive clinics\r\nmore readily, especially California which had no law against birth\r\ncontrol. The same thing would follow in the East. As I told the\r\n_Tribune_, “I have the word of four prominent physicians that they will\r\nsupport me in the work.... There will be nurses in attendance at the\r\nclinic, and doctors who will instruct women in the things they need to\r\nknow. All married women or women about to be married will be assisted\r\nfree and without question.”\r\n\r\nA splendid promise—but difficult to fulfill, as events were to prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Sixteen_\r\n\r\n                          HEAR ME FOR MY CAUSE\r\n\r\n               “_Speak clearly if you speak at all.\r\n               Carve every word before you let it fall._”\r\n                         OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Amos Pinchot asked me how long it had taken me to prepare that\r\nfirst lecture I delivered on my three months’ trip across the country in\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n“About fourteen years,” I answered.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of all the time that had passed during which experiences,\r\ntragic and stirring, had come to me and were embodied therein.\r\n\r\nSo much depended on this speech; the women of leisure must be made to\r\nlisten, the women of wealth to give, the women of influence to protest.\r\nBefore starting April 1st, I tried to put myself in their places and to\r\nsee how their interests and imaginations could most effectively be\r\nexcited, how the pictures which had so unceasingly beset me could best\r\nbe brought to their minds. I felt certain that if I could do this, they\r\nwould do the rest.\r\n\r\nBut the anxiety that went into the composition of the speech was as\r\nnothing to the agonies with which I contemplated its utterance. My\r\nmother used to say a decent woman only had her name in the papers three\r\ntimes during her life—when she was born, when she married, and when she\r\ndied. Although by nature I shrank from publicity, the kind of work I had\r\nundertaken did not allow me to shirk it—but I was frightened to death.\r\nHoping that practice would give me greater confidence, I used to climb\r\nto the roof of the Lexington Avenue hotel where I was staying and\r\nrecite, my voice going out over the house tops and echoing timidly among\r\nthe chimney pots.\r\n\r\nI repeated the lecture over and over to myself before I tried it on a\r\nsmall audience in New Rochelle. I did not dare cut myself adrift from my\r\nnotes; I had to read it, and when I had finished, did not feel it had\r\nbeen very successful. By the time I reached Pittsburgh, my first large\r\ncity, I had memorized every period and comma, but I was still scared\r\nthat if I lost one word I would not know what the next was. I closed my\r\neyes and spoke in fear and trembling. The laborers and social workers\r\nwho crowded the big theater responded so enthusiastically that I was at\r\nleast sure their attention had been held by its content.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to watch the pencils come out at the announcement\r\nthat there were specifically seven circumstances under which birth\r\ncontrol should be practiced.\r\n\r\nFirst, when either husband or wife had a transmissible disease, such as\r\nepilepsy, insanity, or syphilis.\r\n\r\nSecond, when the wife suffered from a temporary affection of the lungs,\r\nheart, or kidneys, the cure of which might be retarded through\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nThird, when parents, though normal, had subnormal children.\r\n\r\nFourth, when husband or wife were adolescent. Early marriage, yes, but\r\nparenthood should be postponed until after the twenty-third year of the\r\nboy and the twenty-second of the girl.\r\n\r\nFifth, when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate; no man\r\nhad the right to have ten children if he could not provide for more than\r\ntwo. The standards of living desirable had to be considered; it was one\r\nthing if the parents were planning college educations for their\r\noffspring, and another if they wanted them simply for industrial\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nSixth, births should be spaced between two and three years, according to\r\nthe mother’s health.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing were self-evident from the physiological and economic\r\npoints of view. But I wished to introduce a final reason which seemed\r\nequally important to me, though it had not been taken into account\r\nstatistically.\r\n\r\nSeventh, every young couple should practice birth control for at least\r\none year after marriage and two as a rule, because this period should be\r\none of physical, mental, financial, and spiritual adjustment in which\r\nthey could grow together, cement the bonds of attraction, and plan for\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nLike other professions, motherhood should serve its apprenticeship. It\r\nwas not good sense to expect fruit from buds—yet if womanhood flowered\r\nfrom girlhood too soon it did not have a chance to be a thing in itself.\r\nI offered a hypothetical case. Suppose two young people started out in\r\nmarriage, ignorant of its implications and possibilities. The bride,\r\nutterly unprepared, returned pregnant from the honeymoon—headaches,\r\nnausea, backache, general fatigue, and depression. The romantic lover\r\nnever knew that girl as a woman; she forever after appeared to him only\r\nas a mother. Under such circumstances marriage seldom had an opportunity\r\nto become as fine an instrument for development as it might have been.\r\n\r\nI wanted the world made safe for babies. From a government survey\r\nsignificant conclusions had emerged as to how many babies lived to\r\ncelebrate their first birthday. These were based largely on three\r\nfactors: the father’s wage—as it went down, more died, and as it rose,\r\nmore survived; the spacing of births—when children were born one year\r\napart, more died than if the mother were allowed a two- or three-year\r\ninterval between pregnancies; the relative position in the family—of the\r\nnumber of second-born, thirty-two out of every hundred died annually,\r\nand so on progressively until among those who were born twelfth, the\r\nrate was sixty out of a hundred.\r\n\r\nI claimed that sympathy and charity extended towards babies were not\r\nenough, that milk stations were not enough, that maternity centers were\r\nnot enough, and that protective legislation in the form of child labor\r\nlaws was not enough. With all the force I could muster I insisted that\r\nthe first right of a child was to be wanted, to be desired, to be\r\nplanned for with an intensity of love that gave it its title to being.\r\nIt should be wanted by both parents, but especially by the mother who\r\nwas to carry it, nourish it, and perhaps influence its life by her\r\nthoughts, her passions, her rebellions, her yearnings.\r\n\r\nSo that all babies born could be assured sound bodies and sound minds, I\r\nsuggested in lighter vein that the Government issue passports for them,\r\ncalling the attention of the audience to the fact that adults in this\r\ncountry would never think of going abroad without a government guarantee\r\nto ensure them safe passage and preservation against harm or\r\nill-treatment. If this were necessary for grown persons journeying into\r\na foreign land, how much more important it was to protect children who\r\nwere to enter into this strange and insecure new world.\r\n\r\nI reminded them also that no one would consider embarking in the medical\r\nor legal profession without due preparation. Even cooks or laundresses\r\nscarcely applied for positions without experience proving they were\r\nqualified to undertake their tasks. But anyone, no matter how ignorant,\r\nhow diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of\r\nchildren, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent.\r\n\r\nIn the same tone I proposed a bureau of application for the unborn. I\r\npictured a married couple coming here for a baby as though for a\r\nchambermaid, chauffeur, or gardener. The unborn child took a look at his\r\nprospective parents and propounded a few questions such as any employee\r\nhas the right to ask of his employer.\r\n\r\nTo his father the unborn child said, “Do you happen to have a health\r\ncertificate?”\r\n\r\nAnd to the mother, “How are your nerves? What do you know about babies?\r\nWhat kind of a table do you set?”\r\n\r\nAnd to both of them, “What are your plans for bringing me up? Am I to\r\nspend my childhood days in factories or mills, or am I to have the\r\nopportunities offered by an intelligent, healthy, family life? I am\r\nunusually gifted,” the baby might add. “Do you know how to develop my\r\ntalents? What sort of society have you made for the fullest expression\r\nof my genius?”\r\n\r\nAll babies came back to the practical question, “How many children have\r\nyou already?”\r\n\r\n“Eight.”\r\n\r\n“How much are you earning?”\r\n\r\n“Ten dollars a week.”\r\n\r\n“And living in two rooms, you say? No, thank you. Next, please.”\r\n\r\nI was trying to make people think in order that they might act. My part\r\nwas to give them the facts and then, when they asked what they should do\r\nabout them, suggest concrete programs for leagues and clinics. Many\r\nwomen had far more executive and administrative experience than I, and I\r\nstill expected them to carry on where I left off so that I might be free\r\nto return to Europe.\r\n\r\nMy hopes seemed well-founded when many of the Pittsburgh audience waited\r\nafterward to request help in organizing themselves. Thus the first state\r\nbirth control league was formed. This and all subsequent ones I referred\r\nto Mrs. Dennett’s National Birth Control League to be under its future\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThat meeting had been held under the sponsorship of Mrs. Enoch Raugh, a\r\nphilanthropist of great courage. In the early days almost everywhere I\r\nwent the subject of birth control was one likely to make conspicuous\r\nthose who identified themselves with it. Average well-to-do persons\r\nhesitated except for the Jewish leaders in civic affairs, who, as soon\r\nas they were personally convinced, showed no reluctance in aligning\r\nthemselves publicly.\r\n\r\nNot so did Chicago respond. Some members of the powerful Women’s City\r\nClub had privately asked me to speak, but when the matter was brought up\r\nbefore their board, the unofficial invitation was officially canceled.\r\nHere again were conservatives enjoying the benefits of birth control for\r\nthemselves but unwilling to endorse it for the less fortunate of their\r\nsex. When they did not listen, I tried to reach the women of the\r\nstockyards directly.\r\n\r\nSo many hundreds of letters had come to me—not only in English, but also\r\nin Hungarian, Bohemian, Polish, and Yiddish—clamoring for information,\r\nthat I had every reason to suppose what I had to say was going to be\r\nwelcome on Halsted Street. I was incredulous when I met an unforeseen\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nHull House and similar settlements had been established to help the poor\r\nto help themselves. But I found that although social agencies had\r\noriginally striven to win confidence by opening milk stations and day\r\nnurseries, this aim had been somewhat obscured in the interests of sheer\r\nefficiency. Many welfare workers had come to treat individuals merely as\r\ncases to be cataloged, arrogantly proclaiming they knew “what was best\r\nfor the poor”; a type had developed, and those who belonged to it were\r\nlacking in human sympathy. Instead they expanded their own egos through\r\ndomination. Their desire to build up prestige and secure a position of\r\nimportance in the community had formed a civic barrier, a wall, in fact,\r\naround the stockyards district, preventing any new concepts, people, or\r\norganizations from coming in without official permission. The stockyards\r\nwomen were literally imprisoned in their homes from advanced ideas\r\nunless they went out into other sections of the city.\r\n\r\nBecause this ridiculous situation had arisen in Chicago, no hall could\r\nbe had in the immediate neighborhood. I could have held no meeting there\r\nhad it not been for Fania Mindell, one of the many idealists of that\r\ntime who threw themselves into the fight for the oppressed as an\r\naftermath of their own sufferings and repressions in Russia. She had a\r\ndevoted and self-sacrificing nature which made her work, slave, toil for\r\nthe love of doing it. She made all the arrangements, producing an\r\naudience of fifteen hundred from the labor and stockyards environs.\r\n\r\nThese first lectures in Chicago and elsewhere attracted women in swarms,\r\npaying their twenty-five cents to fill the auditoriums; I remember that\r\none offered her wedding ring as the price of admission, to be redeemed\r\non pay day. They brought their children, and more than once I had to\r\nlift my voice above the persistent cooing and gurgling of a front-row\r\nbaby. There was a natural understanding between infants. If one were\r\ngiven a bottle, another began to cry. A third in the back joined the\r\nchorus, or a small boy on the side aisle whispered shrilly, “I wantta go\r\nhome!” I just ached to see those many babies, because I knew what their\r\nmothers had come for—definite help to stop having more—and it could not\r\nbe given them.\r\n\r\nOften at these meetings I saw some woman sitting down near the platform\r\nholding a bunch of wild flowers, daisies, Queen Anne’s lace, or\r\nbutter-and-eggs, waiting to present me with the little bouquet, to tell\r\nme that since she had received my pamphlet, she had “kept out of\r\ntrouble.” No matter how phrased, the gratitude was genuine.\r\n\r\nOver and over again someone popped up in front of me, and extended a\r\nhand, “I used to subscribe to the _Woman Rebel_. I got all your\r\npamphlets from England.”\r\n\r\nWhen I asked, “What’s your name?” with the answer, like a flash, came\r\nthe number of children and the locality, and the story sent me years\r\nearlier. And, “Didn’t you live in Des Moines?” I continued. Seldom was\r\nit the wrong place. In this way I came across dozens of “friends” who\r\nhad been among the original two thousand.\r\n\r\nI was advised by Dr. Mabel Ullrich of Minneapolis not to go there\r\nbecause the Twin Cities were the most conservative in America. “You\r\nwon’t get six people,” she prophesied.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I’ll get six?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll go.”\r\n\r\nI was prepared to speak wherever it was possible, regardless of\r\nattendance. Six people, properly convinced, usually made sixty people\r\nthink before very long. In spite of Dr. Ullrich’s warning, hundreds of\r\nchairs had to be brought in to the Minneapolis Public Library to take\r\ncare of the overflow.\r\n\r\nPeople were frequently surprised at the size of my audiences. I should\r\nhave been surprised had it been the other way about, although I did not\r\nlike too many present because the subject was too intimate for great\r\nnumbers in large halls. All came because birth control touched their\r\nlives deeply and vitally; they listened so earnestly, so intently that\r\nthe very atmosphere was hushed and unnaturally quiet.\r\n\r\nHere in Minneapolis arrived a telegram from Frederick A. Blossom, Ph.D.,\r\nmanager of the Associated Charities of Cleveland, whom I had met there.\r\nWould I speak at the National Social Workers’ Conference then being held\r\nin Indianapolis? He could not get me placed on the program, but the two\r\nsubjects that were currently arousing considerable interest were the\r\nprison reforms instituted by Thomas Mott Osborne at Sing Sing, and birth\r\ncontrol. He believed it was worth my while to come.\r\n\r\nSince I had nearly a week before my scheduled meeting in St. Louis, the\r\ntime fitted in very nicely and I seized the occasion. I did not expect\r\ndefinite action, but I did yearn to arouse dissatisfaction over\r\nsmoothing off the top, to say to these social workers plodding along in\r\ntheir organizations that I thought their accomplishments were temporary,\r\nand that charity was only a feather duster flicking from the surface\r\nparticles which merely settled somewhere else. They could never attain\r\ntheir ideal of eliminating the problems of the masses until the breeding\r\nof the unending stream of unwanted babies was stopped.\r\n\r\nBlossom, polished, educated, and clever, had a charming and disarming\r\npersonality, and an ability far above the average. Part of his work had\r\nbeen to cultivate the rich, and in this he had been eminently successful\r\nbecause he was so suave, never waving a red flag in front of anybody’s\r\nnose as I did; my flaming Feminism speeches had scared some of my\r\nsupporters out of their wits.\r\n\r\nThis master manager knew exactly what to do and how to go about it.\r\nNotices were posted throughout the hotel and left in every delegate’s\r\nmail box, announcing the meeting for four in the afternoon, the only\r\nhour when we could have the big amphitheater. Although round-table\r\ndiscussions were going on at the same time, it was jammed to the doors;\r\npeople were sitting on the platform and on window sills and radiators.\r\n\r\nI was almost startled that so many of those from whom I hoped for\r\nco-operation should turn out in such numbers. Walter Lippmann said,\r\n“This will kick the football of birth control straight across to the\r\nPacific.” And, indeed, the social agents, like the plumed darts of a\r\nseeded dandelion puffed into the air, scattered to every quarter of the\r\ncountry; thereafter, to the West and back again, I heard echoes of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous weeks in various cities it had been hard to be alone\r\na minute. Women with the inevitable babies kept calling on me in hotels\r\nand so did men setting out to their jobs early in the morning, carrying\r\ntheir lunch boxes. I was so mentally weary with strain that it seemed I\r\nmust get away from humanity for a little while if I were to retain my\r\nsanity. Worst of all was the ever-present loneliness and grief—the\r\napparition of Peggy who wanted me to recognize she had gone and was no\r\nlonger here.\r\n\r\nI slipped into St. Louis two days ahead so that I could be by myself,\r\nregistering at the Hotel Jefferson and asking not to be disturbed. But\r\nthe telephone rang before I even had my suitcase unpacked; a reporter\r\nhad seen my name at the desk and requested an interview. I replied I\r\ncould not give it; I was not in St. Louis so far as he was concerned.\r\nSaying to myself, “Good, I’ve escaped that,” I went to bed. But next\r\nmorning a ribbon on the front page of his paper announced I was “hiding”\r\nin the city. In my ignorance I had violated the etiquette observed by\r\nwelcoming committees, and mine was highly indignant. I had little rest.\r\n\r\nAmong the group of backers was Robert Minor, an old friend, formerly an\r\noutstanding cartoonist on the New York _World_, who had been dropped\r\nbecause he had refused to draw the kind of pictures about Germany his\r\nemployers wanted. It had been arranged that I was to have the Victoria\r\nTheater Sunday night, which had already been paid for in advance so that\r\nthe meeting could be free. However, at a quarter to eight when we\r\narrived, the building was in total darkness and the doors were locked.\r\nThe proprietor’s office was closed; he was not at home; there was no\r\nmeans of finding out anything. Actually, he had temporarily effaced\r\nhimself because he did not wish to admit that he had been threatened\r\nwith a Catholic boycott of his theater, and had been promised protection\r\nagainst a possible suit for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nAt least two thousand people had gathered and were filling the air with\r\ncatcalls, hisses, hurrahs, cries of “the Catholics run the town! Break\r\nin the door!” Minor urged me to stand up in the car and give my speech,\r\nbut without its proper setting I was lost; here was a type of battle\r\nneeding an experienced campaigner. Although I did not feel adequate, I\r\nbegan, but my voice could not surmount the uproar.\r\n\r\nI was barely under way when a police sergeant reached up and seized my\r\narm. “Here now, you’ll have to come down. You can’t talk here.”\r\n\r\n“Speech! Speech!” yelled the crowd. “Go on.”\r\n\r\nBut the owner of the car, to my great relief, started his engine. I sat\r\nback in the seat with a thump and off we went.\r\n\r\nThe incident had repercussions. The Men’s City Club, regarding the event\r\nas a blot on the fair name of the town, asked me to speak at their\r\nluncheon the next day, and I promised to wait over. Although forty\r\nCatholics then resigned in a body, St. Louis would not be coerced, and\r\nmore than a hundred new members joined immediately.\r\n\r\nWilliam Marion Reedy, owner and publisher of the famous _Reedy’s\r\nMirror_, had been at the closed theater. He printed a cartoon showing\r\nthe Capitol of the United States with a papal crown on it, stated\r\neditorially that the Pope was now dictating to America what it should\r\nhear and think, and emphasized the consequent dangers to the country if\r\nany religious group were allowed such domination. “No idea let loose in\r\nthe world has ever been suppressed. Ideas cannot be jailed in\r\n_oubliettes_,” was his peroration.\r\n\r\nAfter I had left the Middle West and reached the Rocky Mountains the\r\natmosphere changed. I was struck even by the attitude of the bellboys\r\nand waiters at the Brown Palace Hotel in Denver. In New York you were\r\nserved by trained foreign men and boys—Italian and French. Here they\r\nwere American-born, blue-eyed, fair-complexioned, strong-jawed. Without\r\nbowing or obsequiousness they brought your food and carried your bags as\r\nif doing you a favor. You hesitated to give them a tip, though, as a\r\nmatter of fact, they never refused it.\r\n\r\nI loved Denver itself. It seemed to me the women there were the most\r\nbeautiful I had seen—fresh, charming, alive. They had long had the vote\r\nand used it effectively. Because they believed in Judge Ben Lindsey’s\r\njuvenile court, they had kept him in office in spite of the concerted\r\nantagonism of picturesque but corrupt politicians.\r\n\r\nAlthough Judge Lindsey had bitter enemies in exalted places, he had\r\nloyal friends also. When Theodore Roosevelt had stopped there in 1912 on\r\nhis Western Swing, the Judge was facing opposition. The city fathers did\r\nnot want to include him as a substantial citizen on their platform\r\ncommittee of welcome. Roosevelt peered vainly about among all these\r\nbankers and business men. “Where’s Ben Lindsey?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We don’t talk about him around here.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t we? Well, he’s a friend of mine. I shan’t say a word until Ben\r\nLindsey comes and sits on this platform beside me.”\r\n\r\nNor would he speak until Lindsey arrived; everybody had to wait.\r\n\r\nIt was a high point for me at this time, so soon after my own court\r\nappearance, to have Judge Lindsey preside at my meeting. Formerly my\r\nlisteners, with the exception of Indianapolis, had been chiefly of the\r\nworking class. Here they were wives of doctors, lawyers, petty\r\nofficials, members of clubs.\r\n\r\nI was more than delighted to have an audience which had the power to\r\nchange public opinion. The “submerged tenth” had no need of theories nor\r\nthe proof of the advantages of family limitation; they were the\r\nproof—the living example of the need. It was vitally important to have\r\nreflective hearers who not only themselves used contraceptives, but who\r\nadvanced thought through literature, discussions, and papers. To them I\r\nwas telling the story of those millions who could not come, and trying\r\nto relate it as I knew it to be true. Stimulating them offered the best\r\npossibility of getting something done.\r\n\r\nJudge Lindsey invited me to sit on the bench with him the next morning,\r\nand I watched enthralled the way he handled his cases. The familiar\r\ncourt method was punishment, and the more punishment the better. But he\r\noperated on the new psychology. For instance, he attempted to inculcate\r\na sense of responsibility in one boy who had disobeyed his mother and\r\nrun away from school, by showing him his indebtedness to her, how he\r\nshould be helping rather than causing her grief.\r\n\r\nThe same tactics were employed in the case of Joseph, charged with\r\nassault on his wife, Nelly, who stood silently in the background, shawl\r\nover her head. Lindsey read the evidence, then said, “Joseph, come over\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nJoseph stepped nearer, appearing somewhat guilty, as men of his status\r\nusually did when they came into court.\r\n\r\n“What’s this I hear about you? Why did you strike Nelly?”\r\n\r\n“She made me mad,” Joseph mumbled.\r\n\r\n“Joseph, turn your head and look at your wife. Look at her! Look!—thin,\r\npale, weak, and you a big strong man striking that delicate little\r\nwoman. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself to beat Nelly? You who promised to\r\nlove, honor, and protect her?”\r\n\r\nThe reprimanding lasted fully two minutes. Finally tears began to spring\r\nfrom Nelly’s eyes and to run down her face. She moved forward, took\r\nJoseph by the hand, and said, “Oh, he’s not so bad, Judge.” Joseph then\r\nembraced her. Instead of punishing him, which would in effect have also\r\nbeen punishing Nelly, Judge Lindsey put him on parole to report back in\r\ntwo months’ time, and husband and wife went out arm in arm.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest things for a judge in a lower court to combat is the\r\nprejudice of the police against those who already have records. Judge\r\nLindsey, when a case came up before him, never took the word of the ward\r\nheelers, but had his own secretary, employed and paid by him, go to the\r\nhome and investigate, and he held the case until this had been done. But\r\nI thought then that either Judge Lindsey was heading straight for\r\ntrouble, or Denver had a kingdom of its own where freedom reigned.\r\n\r\nA similar attitude of liberality prevailed on the far side of the\r\nRockies. In many places where I had previously spoken, policemen had\r\nbeen stationed at the doors. Occasionally they had even come to the\r\nhotel to read my speech, as at St. Louis and Indianapolis. But in Los\r\nAngeles officials of all the city, even the representatives of the\r\nwomen’s police division, met me at the station or called on me in a\r\nfriendly way.\r\n\r\nI was still as terrified of speaking as in the beginning; I used to wake\r\nup early in the morning, sometimes before it was light, and feel a\r\nghastly depression coming over me. I realized it was the impending\r\nlecture which was so affecting me, and I waited in trepidation for the\r\nhour. My physical illness did not grow better until I was on my feet and\r\nwell into my subject.\r\n\r\nThough this was my first visit to the West, I had no time for scenery.\r\nWhenever possible I traveled by night and arrived during the day, and by\r\nthis stage of my trip I was seemingly always tired. The dead grind went\r\non and on, an endless succession of getting off trains, introductions,\r\ntalking to committees, pouring yourself out—and nothing happening.\r\nPhysically and psychically it was one of the lowest periods of my life.\r\n\r\nSomeone in San Francisco did a lovely thing for me. I never knew who she\r\nwas, but at the end of one meeting she picked me up in her car and swept\r\nme away into a forest of huge, tall trees where the sun broke through.\r\nThere she left me for fifteen minutes in the midst of a cathedral of\r\ngreat evergreens with the sky overhead and myself alone. I have never\r\nforgotten the peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nI found the West Coast a lively place. Ideas were being constantly\r\nthrashed out. Every discourse had a challenging reception. Emma Goldman\r\nhad been there year after year and had stirred people to dare express\r\nthemselves. All sorts of individuals catechized you, and if you were not\r\nwell grounded in your subject you were quickly made aware of your\r\nignorance. The Wobblies spent hours in libraries, not only keeping warm,\r\nbut trying to find points on which to attack the next lecturer who\r\nshould come to town. Often those most eager were considered cranks—on\r\ndiet, free trade, single tax, and free silver—so familiar that their\r\nrising was hailed with groans. I never minded having questions asked,\r\nthough everything I knew was questioned. It was as well for me that, in\r\naddition to my Malthus, I knew my Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, my Henry\r\nGeorge, Marx, and Kropotkin. It seems to me that today the tone of\r\naudiences has deteriorated; queries rarely have the same intellectual\r\ngrasp behind them.\r\n\r\nMy welcome at Portland was delightful. The sixty-year-old poet, C. E. S.\r\nWood, dapper and gracious, made a practice of greeting personally women\r\nspeakers, dedicating poems to them on their arrival, and sending bowers\r\nof flowers to their hotel rooms. The City of Roses did much to entertain\r\nits visitors.\r\n\r\nHere I was invited by a church to address its congregation following the\r\nevening service. I had not been very well in the afternoon, but I\r\npromised over the telephone to be there if I could. I was late and the\r\nmeeting had already begun. As I slipped in at the rear I heard the\r\nchairman refer to me as a Joan of Arc. Entirely too many Joans of Arc\r\nwere floating about in those days. Not wishing to be a disappointment I\r\nturned right around and walked back to the hotel. Since no one had ever\r\nseen me, both my entrance and exit went unremarked.\r\n\r\nI admired robust, vital women; they appeared so efficient, and I\r\nregretted the fact that I did not give the same impression. I felt that\r\nway, but could not help resembling, as someone phrased it, “a hungry\r\nflower drooping in the rain.” If I were in a room with ten people and\r\nsomebody came in who expected me to be present, she invariably\r\napproached the biggest woman and addressed her, “How do you do, Mrs.\r\nSanger?” For a brief while I tried to make myself seem more\r\ncompetent-looking by wearing severe suits, but this phase did not last;\r\nfor one thing, effective simplicity cost money and I did not have enough\r\nto be really well-tailored. However, the anonymity due to my appearance\r\nwas, on the whole, fortunate. I was always able to go along any street,\r\ninto any restaurant or shop, and seldom be identified, and this made it\r\npossible for me to maintain a relatively private life.\r\n\r\nA dinner was given at Portland; the chairman, who had seen Susan B.\r\nAnthony and many other women with causes come and go, made a short\r\nspeech of introduction. I rarely remember what people say on such\r\noccasions, but one of her statements has remained in my mind. “I would\r\nlike to see Margaret Sanger again after ten years. Most movements either\r\nbreak you or develop the ‘public figure’ type of face which has become\r\nhard and set through long and furious battling. But her cause is\r\ndifferent from any other I have ever known. I should like to see how she\r\ncomes out of it.”\r\n\r\nI have thought of this many times—how, if the cause is not great enough\r\nto lift you outside yourself, you can be driven to the point of\r\nbitterness by public apathy and, within your own circle, by the petty\r\nprides and jealousies of little egos which clamor for attention and\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nOne of the first persons I met in the city was Dr. Marie Equi, of\r\nItalian ancestry and Latin fire. Definitely, she was an individualist\r\nand a rugged one. Her strong, large body could stand miles and miles on\r\nhorseback night or day. She had been brought up in the pioneer era when\r\nmedical work was genuine service. If cowboys or Indians were in fights,\r\ndifficulties, jail, Dr. Equi was always on hand to speak a good word for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was in Portland that I realized _Family Limitation_, which had been\r\ncrudely and hurriedly written in 1914, needed revising. The working\r\nwomen to whom it was addressed needed the facts. It had served its\r\npurpose in its unpolished state, but the time had now come to reach the\r\nmiddle classes, for whom it required a slightly more professional tone.\r\nDr. Equi gave me genuine assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe wider the distribution of the pamphlet, the happier I was. Since it\r\nhad not been copyrighted, anybody who wanted to could reprint as many as\r\nhe wished, and I.W.W. lumberjacks, for example, transients without\r\nfamilies who moved to California for the crop harvesting in the summer,\r\noften thus provided themselves with a little extra money as they\r\njourneyed from place to place. When they unrolled the blankets draped\r\nover their shoulders out dropped a half-dozen or so pamphlets.\r\n\r\nAn automobile mechanic of Portland had made one of these reprints and\r\nasked me whether he could sell it at my next meeting. I myself had never\r\ndistributed _Family Limitation_ publicly, but if any local people wanted\r\nto do so, I had no objection. Accordingly the mechanic and two of his\r\nfriends sold copies and were arrested. Their trial was postponed so that\r\nI could deliver my proposed lectures in Seattle and Spokane.\r\n\r\nWhen these were over I came back to serve as a witness, and at another\r\nmeeting held the night preceding the trial four more of us were\r\narrested, Dr. Equi, two Englishwomen, and myself. I was tremendously\r\ngratified by seeing women for the first time come out openly with\r\ncourage; over a hundred followed us through the streets to the jail\r\nasking to be “let in too. We also have broken the law.”\r\n\r\nThe city jail was nice and clean and warm. The girls, who were not\r\nlocked in cells, scampered around talking over their troubles and\r\ncomplaints with Dr. Equi, and receiving condolence and wholesome advice\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nThe seven of us were tried together the next day. Two lawyers took upon\r\nthemselves the responsibility of defending us, and they were splendid.\r\nWe were all found guilty. The men were fined ten dollars, which the\r\nJudge said they need not pay; the women were not fined at all.\r\n\r\nThe papers made a great to-do about the affair but it was not a type of\r\npublicity of my choosing and did little to bring the goal nearer. The\r\nyear 1916 was filled with such turmoil, some of it useful, some not. The\r\nferment was working violently. Everybody began starting things here and\r\nthere. Many radicals, some of whom I did not even know, were\r\ndistributing leaflets, getting themselves arrested and jailed. Meetings\r\nwere being held in New York on street corners, at Union Square, Madison\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nYou had to keep a steady head, to be about your business, to make\r\ncareful decisions, to waste the least possible time on trivialities; it\r\nwas always a problem to prevent emotional scatter-brains from disturbing\r\nthe clear flow of the stream. The public, quite naturally, could not be\r\nexpected to distinguish between purposeful activities and any others\r\ncarried on in the name of the movement.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman and her campaign manager, Ben Reitman, belatedly advocated\r\nbirth control, not to further it but strategically to utilize in their\r\nown program of anarchism the publicity value it had achieved. Earlier\r\nshe had made me feel she considered it unimportant in the class\r\nstruggle. Suddenly, when in 1916 it had demonstrated the fact that it\r\nwas important, she delivered a lecture on the subject, was arrested, and\r\nsentenced to ten days.\r\n\r\nBen Reitman, who used to go up and down the aisles at meetings shouting\r\nout Emma Goldman’s _Mother Earth_ in a voice that never needed a\r\nmegaphone, was also arrested when the police found on the table of her\r\nlecture hall in Rochester several books on birth control. One of these\r\nwas by Dr. Robinson, who had hastily published a volume purporting to\r\ngive contraceptive information. The unwary purchaser discovered when he\r\ncame to the section supposed to give him the facts for which he had paid\r\nhis money that the pages were blank and empty.\r\n\r\nOf far greater interest to me was the decision of Jessie Ashley, Ida\r\nRauh, who was Max Eastman’s wife, and Bolton Hall, a leader in the\r\nsingle tax movement, to make test cases on the grounds that the denial\r\nof contraceptive information to women whose health might be endangered\r\nby pregnancy was unconstitutional since the Constitution guaranteed each\r\nindividual the right to liberty. These three had themselves arrested on\r\nbirth control charges. They were all three convicted and given a choice\r\nof fines or terms in prison. They paid the former, announcing that they\r\nwould appeal, but, most unfortunately, as it turned out later, they did\r\nnot carry through their intentions.\r\n\r\nA sympathetic thing if not a wise one was being done by a young man in\r\nBoston named Van Kleek Allison, who started handing out leaflets to\r\nworkers as they emerged from factories. Early in the summer he gave one\r\nto a police decoy, was arrested and sentenced to three years. Dear old\r\nBoston, the home of the Puritan, rose in all its strength and held a\r\nhuge meeting of protest on his behalf.\r\n\r\nThis was the occasion of my first heckling. A Jewish convert to\r\nCatholicism, named Goldstein, began belligerently to fling questions at\r\nme. It was not in the sense of trying to find out the answers, but as\r\nthough he had them wrapped up in his own pocket and were merely trying\r\nto trap me, and he, in turn, had his answers ready for mine. But after\r\nmy Western experiences I was not unprepared and was aided, furthermore,\r\nby other members of the audience who spoke in my defense when he became\r\nalmost insulting.\r\n\r\nI never made light of questioners and never judged any question too\r\ntrivial or unworthy of an honest response. I believed that for each\r\nperson who had the courage to ask there must be at least twenty-five who\r\nwould like to know, and I have never assumed anyone was seeking to trick\r\nme into giving illegal information, even though his inquiry might appear\r\nas intended to confuse me or be vindictively thrust at me. I usually\r\nreplied, “That’s an interesting point. I’m glad you raised it,” and then\r\nproceeded to discuss it as best I could.\r\n\r\nAnother heckling in Albany resulted in a joyous reunion. Somebody in the\r\naudience insisted my work was unnecessary. I would ordinarily have paid\r\nno attention, not considering the statement at all personal. But there\r\narose a lady, wearing a high lace collar propped up with whalebones, and\r\na hat that sat flat on her head, a ghost out of my school-girl days. “I\r\nam acquainted with Margaret Sanger,” she stated. “I have slept with her,\r\nI have lived with her, I have worked with her, I have delivered her, and\r\nI have named my baby for her.” Here was dear old Amelia come to champion\r\nme. Her type of dress had remained the same as fifteen years before, but\r\nso had her loyalty and wit. The lecture over, we went back together to\r\nher home in Schenectady; she hauled out from the attic scrapbooks and\r\nphotographs and snapshots taken at Claverack, and we sat on the floor\r\nand rocked with laughter until three in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to New York after my long trip I took a studio apartment\r\nin what seemed like a bit of old Chelsea on Fourteenth Street way over\r\nbetween Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Gertrude Boyle, the sculptress, had\r\nthe one below me, and my sister Ethel moved in above. Occasionally\r\nfather came down from Cape Cod to spend some time with us.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was never quite warm enough, because it lacked central\r\nheating, it hardened me physically, and the open fireplaces, stoked\r\nincessantly by expansive and voluble Vito Silecchia, the Italian coal\r\nvendor, kept the air fresh and clean. The lovely high ceilings, the tall\r\nwindows, and the broad doors flung wide between the rooms, gave an\r\natmosphere of space, and the marvelous carved woodwork was a joy. The\r\nwindows in the rear were draped with light yellow curtains, reflecting\r\nan illusory glow of sunshine. Above one of these grew a Japanese\r\nwistaria vine; whenever I looked up I saw this little bit of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Seventeen_\r\n\r\n                 FAITH I HAVE BEEN A TRUANT IN THE LAW\r\n\r\n        “_If a woman grows weary and at last dies from\r\n        childbearing, it matters not. Let her only die from\r\n        bearing; she is there to do it._”\r\n\r\n                                                   MARTIN LUTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1916 whoever walked along the corridor of the top floor\r\nof 104 Fifth Avenue could have seen the words “Birth Control” printed on\r\nthe door leading to an office equipped in business-like, efficient\r\nmanner with files and card catalogs. Presiding over it was Fred Blossom,\r\nthe perfect representative. He had told me at Cleveland he was tired of\r\nameliorative charity and, wanting to do something more significant, had\r\noffered six months for this work. Now indefatigably he wrote, spoke,\r\nmade friends, and, most important, raised money. His meals were limited\r\nto an apple for luncheon and a sandwich for dinner; he seldom left the\r\noffice until midnight.\r\n\r\nLike a vacuum cleaner Blossom sucked in volunteers from near and far to\r\nhelp with the boxes and trunks of letters which had come to me from all\r\nover the country—one thousand from St. Louis alone. As long as I had had\r\nno stenographic aid I had been able only to open and read them and put\r\nthem sadly away. At last with fifteen or twenty assistants the task\r\nbegan of sorting these out and answering them. The contents almost\r\ninvariably fell into certain definite categories, and I instituted a\r\nsystem so that such and such a paragraph could be sent in response to\r\nsuch and such an appeal.\r\n\r\nWe had only one paid stenographer—little Anna Lifshiz, who soon became\r\nfar more a co-worker than a secretary. If we had no money in the bank\r\nshe waited for her salary until we did. When I met Anna’s mother, who\r\ngraced her hospitable home with an old world dignity, I realized that\r\nher daughter’s fine character had been directly inherited. Every\r\nChristmas I used to receive a present of wine and cakes of Mrs. Lifshiz’\r\nown make, and Anna always said when she brought them, “My mother prays\r\nfor your health, your happiness, and that you will keep well.”\r\n\r\nI had been encouraged by the interest aroused during my Western trip,\r\nbut was by no means satisfied. The practical idea of giving\r\ncontraceptive information in clinics set up for that purpose had seemed\r\nto meet general approval everywhere. Boston at this time appeared a\r\npossible place to begin. Though Allison had to serve sixty days in the\r\nHouse of Correction at Deer Island, the sum total of his sensational\r\ntrial had been good. Before his arrest there had been no league in\r\nMassachusetts, and with his arrest had come publicity, friends, workers,\r\nmeetings, letters, interviews, all of widespread educational value.\r\n\r\nMore important than the enthusiasm which had been stirred up, the best\r\nlegal authorities in Boston had decided that contraceptive information\r\ncould be given verbally by doctors as long as it was not advertised. The\r\ninterpretation to be put on advertising held up the actual opening of a\r\nclinic. The old spirit was there to wage battle but it was a question of\r\ngetting leadership, and this did not come about; no women doctors were\r\nwilling to take the risk. If the citizens of Massachusetts had then\r\nseized the opportunity to broaden their laws, writers and speakers might\r\nnow have more freedom in expressing themselves.\r\n\r\nBlossom soon organized the New York State Birth Control League to change\r\nthe state law. Beyond introducing a bill it made little headway and soon\r\nexpired. It was just one of those many groups that met and talked and\r\ntalked and did nothing effective.\r\n\r\nThe legislative approach seemed to me a slow and tortuous method of\r\nmaking clinics legal; we stood a better and quicker chance by securing a\r\nfavorable judicial interpretation through challenging the law directly.\r\nI decided to open a clinic in New York City, a far more difficult\r\nproceeding than in Boston. Section 1142 of the New York statutes was\r\ndefinite: _No one_ could give contraceptive information to _anyone_ for\r\n_any_ reason. On the other hand, Section 1145 distinctly stated that\r\nphysicians could give prescriptions to prevent conception for the cure\r\nor prevention of disease. Two attorneys and several doctors assured me\r\nthis exception referred only to venereal disease. In that case, the\r\nintent was to protect the man, which could incidentally promote\r\nimmorality and permit promiscuity. I was dealing with marriage. I wanted\r\nthe interpretation to be broadened into the intent to protect women from\r\nill health as the result of excessive childbearing and, equally\r\nimportant, to have the right to control their own destinies.\r\n\r\nTo change this interpretation it was necessary to have a test case.\r\nThis, in turn, required my keeping strictly to the letter of the law;\r\nthat is, having physicians who would give only verbal information for\r\nthe prevention of disease. But the women doctors who had previously\r\npromised to do this now refused. I wrote, telephoned, asked friends to\r\nask other friends to help find someone. None was willing to enter the\r\ncause, fearful of jeopardizing her private practice and of running the\r\nrisk of being censured by her profession; she might even lose her\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nThey had before them the example of Dr. Mary Halton who of all the women\r\nI have known has perhaps the best understanding of the hidden secrets of\r\nthe heart. She has never reached her deserts, and doubtless never will\r\nhave the honors due her, though she has an unknown audience who love her\r\nnot only because she has done something directly for them but because\r\nthey have heard of what she has done for others. She has what to my mind\r\nis the attitude of the real physician; that it is not enough merely to\r\ncure ailments—surroundings, heartaches, privations must also be given\r\nattention. Her office is a human welfare clinic to which women of all\r\nclasses, ages, nationalities go for advice, occasionally without even\r\nreturn carfare. The unmarried ones, who in asking help from doctors or\r\nclinics seldom admit they are unmarried, trust so deeply in Dr. Mary\r\nthat they unburden themselves freely.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary had previously been on the staff of the Grosvenor Hospital and\r\nhad held her evening clinic there. To one of her patients who had been\r\noperated on for glandular tuberculosis she had prescribed a cervical\r\npessary. When a few evenings later the woman had come back to be\r\nrefitted, Dr. Mary had been out and her substitute, horrified and\r\nshocked, had presented the matter to the board. Dr. Mary had been called\r\nbefore them. She had told them in no uncertain terms that the giving of\r\ncontraceptive information to patients in need of it was part of her work\r\nand that she had a right under the law to do so.\r\n\r\nThe board had disagreed with her and asked for her resignation.\r\n\r\nI did not wish to complicate the question of testing the law by having a\r\nnurse give information, because a nurse did not come under the Section\r\n1145 exception. But since I could find no doctor I had to do without.\r\nEthel, a registered nurse, had a readiness to share in helping the\r\nmovement, though she did not belong to it in the same sense as I. Then,\r\nas long as I had to violate the law anyhow, I concluded I might as well\r\nviolate it on a grand scale by including poverty as a reason for giving\r\ncontraceptive information. I did not see why the hardships and worries\r\nof a working man’s wife might not be just as detrimental as any disease.\r\nI wanted a legal opinion on this if possible.\r\n\r\nMy next problems were where the money was to come from and where the\r\nclinic was to be. Ever since I had announced that I was going to open\r\none within a few months I had been buried under an avalanche of queries\r\nas to the place, which for a time I could not answer. The selection of a\r\nsuitable locality was of the greatest importance. I tramped through the\r\nstreets of the Bronx, Brooklyn, the lower sides of Manhattan, East and\r\nWest. I scrutinized the Board of Health vital statistics of all the\r\nboroughs—births and infant and maternal mortality in relation to low\r\nwages, and also the number of philanthropic institutions in the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nThe two questions—where and how—were settled on one and the same day.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon five women from the Brownsville Section of Brooklyn\r\ncrowded into my room seeking the “secret” of birth control. Each had\r\nfour children or more, who had been left with neighbors. One had just\r\nrecovered from an abortion which had nearly killed her. “Another will\r\ntake me off. Then what will become of my family?”\r\n\r\nThey rocked back and forth as they related their afflictions, told so\r\nsimply, each scarcely able to let her friend finish before she took up\r\nthe narration of her own sufferings—the high cost of food, her husband’s\r\nmeager income when he worked at all, her helplessness in the struggle to\r\nmake ends meet, whining, sickly children, the constant worry of another\r\nbaby—and always hanging over her night and day, year after year, was\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nAll cried what a blessing and godsend a clinic would be in their\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nThey talked an hour and when they had finished, it seemed as though I\r\nmyself had been through their tragedies. I was reminded of the story of\r\na Spaniard who had become so desperate over the injustice meted out to\r\ninnocent prisoners that he had taken a revolver into the street and\r\nfired it at the first person he met; killing was his only way of\r\nexpressing indignation. I felt like doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nI decided then and there that the clinic should open at Brownsville, and\r\nI would look for a site the next day. How to finance it I did not know,\r\nbut that did not matter.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the telephone rang and I heard a feminine voice saying she\r\nhad just come from the West Coast bringing from Kate Crane Gartz, whom I\r\nhad met in Los Angeles, a check for fifty dollars to do with as I\r\nwished. I knew what I should do with it; pay the first month’s rent. I\r\nvisualized two rooms on the ground floor, one for waiting and one for\r\nconsultation, and a place outside to leave the baby carriages.\r\n\r\nFania Mindell had left Chicago to assist me in New York. It was a\r\nterribly rainy day in early October that we plodded through the dreary\r\nstreets of Brownsville to find the most suitable spot at the cheapest\r\npossible terms. We stopped in one of the milk stations to inquire about\r\nvacant stores. “Don’t come over here,” was the reply. Many social\r\norganizations were being established to meet the demands of poverty and\r\nsickness, and we asked of them all, only to receive the same\r\nresponse—“We don’t want any trouble. Keep out of this district.” The\r\nmildest comment was, “It’s a good idea, but we can’t help you.” Although\r\nthey agreed the mothers of the community should limit their families,\r\nthey seemed terrified at the prospect of a birth control clinic. It\r\nsounded also as if they were afraid we would do away with social\r\nproblems and they would lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nBrownsville was not unique; Brooklyn was and still is dotted with such\r\ndismal villages, and even Queens with its pretensions to a higher\r\nstandard has its share. But Brownsville was particularly dingy and\r\nsqualid. Block after block, street after street, as far as we could see\r\nin every direction stretched the same endless lines of cramped,\r\nunpainted houses that crouched together as though for warmth, bursting\r\nwith excess of wretched humanity.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants were mostly Jews and Italians, some who had come to this\r\ncountry as children, some of the second generation. I preferred a Jewish\r\nlandlord, and Mr. Rabinowitz was the answer. He was willing to let us\r\nhave Number 46 Amboy Street at fifty dollars a month, a reduction from\r\nthe regular rent because he realized what we were trying to do. Here in\r\nthis Jewish community I need have no misgivings over breaking of windows\r\nor hurling of epithets, but I was scarcely prepared for the friendliness\r\noffered from that day on.\r\n\r\nI sent a letter to the District Attorney of Brooklyn, saying I expected\r\nto dispense contraceptive information from this address. Without waiting\r\nfor the reply, which never came, we began the fun of fixing up our\r\nlittle clinic. We had to keep furnishing expenses inside the budget, but\r\nFania knew Yiddish and also how to bargain. We bought chairs, desks,\r\nfloor coverings, curtains, a stove. If I were to leave no loophole in\r\ntesting the law, we could only give the principles of contraception,\r\nshow a cervical pessary to the women, explain that if they had had two\r\nchildren they should have one size and if more a larger one. This was\r\nnot at all ideal, but I had no other recourse at the time. However, we\r\nmight be able to get a doctor any day and, consequently, we added an\r\nexamination table to our equipment.\r\n\r\nMr. Rabinowitz spent hours adding touches here and there to make the two\r\nshiny and spotless rooms even more snow-white. “More hospital looking,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we had printed about five thousand notices in English,\r\nItalian, and Yiddish:\r\n\r\n MOTHERS!\r\n             Can you afford to have a large family?\r\n             Do you want any more children?\r\n             If not, why do you have them?\r\n       DO NOT KILL, DO NOT TAKE LIFE, BUT PREVENT\r\n Safe, Harmless Information can be obtained of trained Nurses at\r\n                         46 AMBOY STREET\r\n                   NEAR PITKIN AVE.—BROOKLYN.\r\n   Tell Your Friends and Neighbors.      All Mothers Welcome\r\n A registration fee of 10 cents entitles any mother to this information.\r\n\r\nThese we poked into letter boxes, house after house, day after day,\r\nupstairs, downstairs, all over the place, viewing sadly the unkempt\r\nchildren who swarmed in the alleyways and over the fire escapes of the\r\ncondemned tenements and played on the rubbish heaps in the vacant lots.\r\nSeldom did we see a woman who was not carrying or wheeling a baby. We\r\nstopped to talk to each and gave her a supply of leaflets to hand on to\r\nher neighbors. When we passed by a drugstore we arranged with the\r\nproprietor to prepare himself for supplying the pessaries we were going\r\nto recommend.\r\n\r\nThe morning of October 16, 1916—crisp but sunny and bright after days of\r\nrain—Ethel, Fania, and I opened the doors of the first birth control\r\nclinic in America, the first anywhere in the world except the\r\nNetherlands. I still believe this was an event of social significance.\r\n\r\nWould the women come? Did they come? Nothing, not even the ghost of\r\nAnthony Comstock, could have kept them away. We had arrived early, but\r\nbefore we could get the place dusted and ourselves ready for the\r\nofficial reception, Fania called, “Do come outside and look.” Halfway to\r\nthe corner they were standing in line, at least one hundred and fifty,\r\nsome shawled, some hatless, their red hands clasping the cold, chapped,\r\nsmaller ones of their children.\r\n\r\nFania began taking names, addresses, object in coming to the clinic,\r\nhistories—married or single, any miscarriages or abortions, how many\r\nchildren, where born, what ages. Remembering how the Netherlands clinics\r\nin recording nothing had made it almost hopeless to measure what they\r\nhad accomplished from the human point of view, I had resolved that our\r\nfiles should be as complete as it was possible to make them. Fania had a\r\ncopy of _What Every Girl Should Know_ on her desk, and, if she had a\r\nfree moment, read from it. When asked, she told where it could be\r\nbought, and later kept a few copies for the convenience of those who\r\nwanted them.\r\n\r\nChildren were left with her and mothers ushered in to Ethel or me in the\r\nrear room, from seven to ten at once. To each group we explained simply\r\nwhat contraception was; that abortion was the wrong way—no matter how\r\nearly it was performed it was taking life; that contraception was the\r\nbetter way, the safer way—it took a little time, a little trouble, but\r\nwas well worth while in the long run, because life had not yet begun.\r\n\r\nSome women were alone, some were in pairs, some with their neighbors,\r\nsome with their married daughters. Some did not dare talk this over with\r\ntheir husbands, and some had been urged on by them. At seven in the\r\nevening they were still coming, and men also, occasionally bringing\r\ntheir timid, embarrassed wives, or once in a while by themselves to say\r\nthey would stay home to take care of the children if their wives could\r\ncome. A hundred women and forty men passed through the doors, but we\r\ncould not begin to finish the line; the rest were told to return\r\n“tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next few days women appeared clutching minute\r\nscraps of paper, seldom more than an inch wide, which had crept into\r\nprint. The Yiddish and Italian papers had picked up the story from the\r\nhandbills which bore the clinic address, and the husbands had read them\r\non their way from work and clipped them out for their wives. Women who\r\nhad seen the brief, inconspicuous newspaper accounts came even from\r\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the far end of Long Island.\r\n\r\nNewly married couples with little but love, faith, and hope to save them\r\nfrom charity, told of the tiny flats they had chosen, and of their\r\ndetermination to make a go of it together if only the children were not\r\nborn too soon. A gaunt skeleton suddenly stood up one morning and made\r\nan impassioned speech. “They offer us charity when we have more babies\r\nthan we can feed, and when we get sick with more babies for trying not\r\nto have them they just give us more charity talks!”\r\n\r\nWomen who were themselves already past childbearing age came just to\r\nurge us to preserve others from the sorrows of ruined health, overworked\r\nhusbands, and broods of defective and wayward children growing up in the\r\nstreets, filling dispensaries and hospitals, filing through the juvenile\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nWe made records of every applicant and, though the details might vary,\r\nthe stories were basically identical. All were confused, groping among\r\nthe ignorant sex-teachings of the poor, fumbling without guidance after\r\ntruth, misled and bewildered in a tangled jungle of popular\r\nsuperstitions and old wives’ remedies. Unconsciously they dramatized the\r\nterrible need of intelligent and scientific instruction in these matters\r\nof life—and death.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable many were kept away by the report that the police were\r\nto raid us for performing abortions. “Clinic” was a word which to the\r\nuneducated usually signified such a place. We would not have minded\r\nparticularly being raided on this charge, because we could easily\r\ndisprove it. But these rumors also brought the most pitiful of all, the\r\nreluctantly expectant mothers who hoped to find some means of getting\r\nout of their dilemmas. Their desperate threats of suicide haunted you at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOne Jewish wife, after bringing eight children to birth, had had two\r\nabortions and heaven knows how many miscarriages. Worn out, beaten down,\r\nnot only by toiling in her own kitchen, but by taking in extra work from\r\na sweatshop making hats, she was now at the end of her strength, nervous\r\nbeyond words, and in a state of morbid excitement. “If you don’t help\r\nme, I’m going to chop up a glass and swallow it tonight.”\r\n\r\nA woman wrought to the pitch of killing herself was sick—a community\r\nresponsibility. She, most of all, required concentrated attention and\r\ndevotion, and I could not let any such go out of the clinic until her\r\nmood had been altered. Building up hope for the future seemed the best\r\ndeterrent. “Your husband and your children need you. One more won’t make\r\nso much difference.” I had to make each promise to go ahead and have\r\nthis baby and myself promise in return, “You won’t ever have to again.\r\nWe’re going to take care of you.”\r\n\r\nDay after day the waiting room was crowded with members of every race\r\nand creed; Jews and Christians, Protestants and Roman Catholics alike\r\nmade their confessions to us, whatever they may have professed at home\r\nor in church. I asked one bright little Catholic what excuse she could\r\nmake to the priest when he learned she had been to the clinic. She\r\nanswered indignantly, “It’s none of his business. My husband has a weak\r\nheart and works only four days a week. He gets twelve dollars, and we\r\ncan barely live on it now. We have enough children.”\r\n\r\nHer friend, sitting by, nodded approval. “When I was married,” she broke\r\nin, “the priest told us to have lots of children and we listened to him.\r\nI had fifteen. Six are living. I’m thirty-seven years old now. Look at\r\nme! I might be fifty!”\r\n\r\nThat evening I made a mental calculation of fifteen baptismal fees, nine\r\nbaby funerals, masses and candles for the repose of nine baby souls, the\r\nphysical agonies of the mother and the emotional torment of both\r\nparents, and I asked myself, “Is this the price of Christianity?”\r\n\r\nBut it was not altogether sad; we were often cheered by gayer visitors.\r\nThe grocer’s wife on the corner and the widow with six children who kept\r\nthe lunch room up the street dropped in to wish us luck, and the fat old\r\nGerman baker whose wife gave out handbills to everybody passing the door\r\nsent regular donations of doughnuts. Whenever the pressure became so\r\noverwhelming that we could not go out for a meal we were sure to hear\r\nMrs. Rabinowitz call downstairs, “If I bring some hot tea now, will you\r\nstop the people coming?” Two jovial policemen paused at the doorway each\r\nmorning to discuss the weather. Reporters looked in speculating on how\r\nlong we were going to last. The postman delivering his customary fifty\r\nto a hundred letters had his little pleasantry, “Farewell, ladies; hope\r\nI find you here tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the line outside was enough to arouse police attention, nine\r\ndays went by without interference. Then one afternoon when I, still\r\nundiscouraged, was out interviewing a doctor, a woman, large of build\r\nand hard of countenance, entered and said to Fania she was the mother of\r\ntwo children and that she had no money to support more. She did not\r\nappear overburdened or anxious and, because she was so well fed as to\r\nbody and prosperous as to clothes, did not seem to belong to the\r\ncommunity. She bought a copy of _What Every Girl Should Know_ and\r\ninsisted on paying two dollars instead of the usual ten-cent fee.\r\n\r\nFania, who had an intuition about such matters, called Ethel aside and\r\nsaid warningly she was certain this must be a policewoman. But Ethel,\r\nwho was not of the cautious type, replied, “We have nothing to hide.\r\nBring her in anyhow.” She talked with the woman in private, gave her our\r\nliterature and, when asked about our future plans, related them frankly.\r\nThe sceptical Fania pinned the two-dollar bill on the wall and wrote\r\nunderneath, “Received from Mrs. —— of the Police Department, as her\r\ncontribution.” Hourly after that we expected trouble. We had known it\r\nmust occur sooner or later, but would have preferred it to come about in\r\na different way.\r\n\r\nThe next day Ethel and Fania were both absent from the clinic. The\r\nwaiting room was filled almost to suffocation when the door opened and\r\nthe woman who had been described to me came in.\r\n\r\n“Are you Mrs. Sanger?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a police officer. You’re under arrest.”\r\n\r\nThe doors were locked and this Mrs. Margaret Whitehurst and other\r\nplain-clothes members of the vice squad—used to raiding gambling dens\r\nand houses of assignation—began to demand names and addresses of the\r\nwomen, seeing them with babies, broken, old, worried, harrowed, yet\r\ntreating them as though they were inmates of a brothel. Always fearful\r\nin the presence of the police, some began to cry aloud and the children\r\non their laps screamed too. For a few moments it was like a panic, until\r\nI was able to assure them that only I was under arrest; nothing was\r\ngoing to happen to them, and they could return home if they were quiet.\r\nAfter half an hour I finally persuaded the policemen to let these\r\nfrightened women go.\r\n\r\nAll of our four hundred and sixty-four case histories were confiscated,\r\nand the table and demonstration supplies were carried off through the\r\npatient line outside. The more timid had left, but many had stayed. This\r\nwas a region where a crowd could be collected by no more urgent gesture\r\nthan a tilt of the head skyward. Newspaper men with their cameras had\r\njoined the throng and the street was packed. Masses of people spilled\r\nout over the sidewalk on to the pavement, milling excitedly.\r\n\r\nThe patrol wagon came rattling up to our door. I had a certain respect\r\nfor uniformed policemen—you knew what they were about—but none\r\nwhatsoever for the vice squad. I was white hot with indignation over\r\ntheir unspeakable attitude towards the clinic mothers and stated I\r\npreferred to walk the mile to the court rather than sit with them. Their\r\nfeelings were quite hurt. “Why, we didn’t do anything to you, Mrs.\r\nSanger,” they protested. Nevertheless I marched ahead, they following\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nA reporter from the _Brooklyn Eagle_ fell into step beside me and before\r\nwe had gone far suggested, “Now I’ll fix it up with the police that you\r\nmake a getaway, and when we reach that corner you run. I’ll stop and\r\ntalk to them while you skip around the block and get to the station\r\nfirst.” It was fantastic for anyone so to misconstrue what I was doing\r\nas to imagine I would run around the block for a publicity stunt.\r\n\r\nI stayed overnight at the Raymond Street Jail, and I shall never forget\r\nit. The mattresses were spotted and smelly, the blankets stiff with dirt\r\nand grime. The stench nauseated me. It was not a comforting thought to\r\ngo without bedclothing when it was so cold, but, having in mind the\r\ndiseased occupants who might have preceded me, I could not bring myself\r\nto creep under the covers. Instead I lay down on top and wrapped my coat\r\naround me. The only clean object was my towel, and this I draped over my\r\nface and head. For endless hours I struggled with roaches and\r\nhorrible-looking bugs that came crawling out of the walls and across the\r\nfloor. When a rat jumped up on the bed I cried out involuntarily and\r\nsent it scuttling out.\r\n\r\nMy cell was at the end of a center row, all opening front and back upon\r\ntwo corridors. The prisoners gathered in one of the aisles the next\r\nmorning and I joined them. Most had been accused of minor offenses such\r\nas shoplifting and petty thievery. Many had weatherbeaten faces, were a\r\nclass by themselves, laughing and unconcerned. But I heard no coarse\r\nlanguage. Underneath the chatter I sensed a deep and bitter resentment;\r\nsome of them had been there for three or four months without having been\r\nbrought to trial. The more fortunate had a little money to engage\r\nlawyers; others had to wait for the court to assign them legal\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nWhile I was talking to the girls, the matron bustled up with, “The\r\nladies are coming!” and shooed us into our cells. The Ladies, a\r\ncommittee from a society for prison reform, peered at us as though we\r\nwere animals in cages. A gentle voice cooed at me, “Did you come in\r\nduring the night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I returned, overlooking the assumption that I was a street\r\nwalker.\r\n\r\n“Can we do anything for you?”\r\n\r\nThe other inmates were sitting in their corners looking as innocent and\r\nsweet as they could, but I startled her by saying, “Yes, you can. Come\r\nin and clean up this place. It’s filthy and verminous.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee departed hurriedly down the corridor. One more alert\r\nmember, however, came back to ask, “Is it really very dirty?”\r\n\r\nAlthough I told her in some detail about the blankets, the odors, the\r\nroaches, she obviously could not picture the situation. “I’m terribly\r\nsorry, but we can’t change it.”\r\n\r\nI was still exasperated over this reply when I was called to the\r\nreception room to give an interview to reporters. In addition to\r\nanswering questions about the raid I said I had a message to the\r\ntax-payers of Brooklyn; they were paying money to keep their prisons run\r\nin an orderly fashion as in any civilized community and should know it\r\nwas being wasted, because the conditions at Raymond Street were\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nMy bail was arranged by afternoon and when I emerged I saw waiting in\r\nfront the woman who was going to swallow the glass; she had been there\r\nall that time.\r\n\r\nI went straight back to the clinic, reopened it, and more mothers came\r\nin. I had hoped a court decision might allow us to continue, but now Mr.\r\nRabinowitz came downstairs apologetically. He said he was sorry, and he\r\nreally was, but the police had made him sign ejection papers, on the\r\nground that I was “maintaining a public nuisance.”\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands a clinic had been cited as a public benefaction; in\r\nthe United States it was classed as a public nuisance.\r\n\r\nTwo uniformed policemen came for me, and with them I was willing to ride\r\nin the patrol wagon to the station. As we started I heard a scream from\r\na woman who had just come around the corner on her way to the clinic.\r\nShe abandoned her baby carriage, rushed through the crowd, and cried,\r\n“Come back! Come back and save me!” For a dozen yards she ran after the\r\nvan before someone caught her and led her to the sidewalk. But the last\r\nthing I heard was this poor distracted mother, shrieking and calling,\r\n“Come back! Come back!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Eighteen_\r\n\r\n                      LEAN HUNGER AND GREEN THIRST\r\n\r\n                   “_All that we know who lie in gaol\r\n                     Is that the wall is strong;\r\n                   And that each day is like a year,\r\n                     A year whose days are long._”\r\n                                         OSCAR WILDE\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back upon this period fraught with emotional distress, I have no\r\nregrets. But, looking ahead, I am grateful that there looms no necessity\r\nfor repeating those passionate, dangerous, and menacing days.\r\n\r\nOut of the raid four separate cases resulted: Ethel was charged with\r\nviolating Section 1142 of the Penal Code, designed to prevent\r\ndissemination of contraceptive information; Fania with having sold an\r\nallegedly indecent book entitled _What Every Girl Should Know_; I,\r\nfirst, with having conducted a clinic in violation of the same Section\r\n1142, second, with violating Section 1530 by maintaining a public\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nI claimed that Section 1142 which forbade contraceptive information to,\r\nfor, and by anyone was unconstitutional, because no state was permitted\r\nto interfere with a citizen’s right to life or liberty, and such denial\r\nwas certainly interference. Experience had shown it did the case no good\r\nmerely to defend such a stand in a lower court; it must be carried to a\r\nhigher tribunal, and only a lawyer versed in whereases and whatsoevers\r\nand inasmuch-ases could accomplish this. But I was still hopeful of\r\nfinding one who was able to see that the importance of birth control\r\ncould not be properly emphasized if we bowed too deeply before the slow\r\nand ponderous majesty of the law.\r\n\r\nThe attorney who offered himself, J. J. Goldstein, had a background\r\nwhich made him more sympathetic than other lawyers, even the most\r\nliberal. He was one of those young Jewish men of promise who had been\r\nguided through adolescence by Mary Simkhovitch, founder of Greenwich\r\nHouse, and Lillian Wald, founder of the Henry Street Settlement. The\r\nseeds of social service had been planted in him; his legal training only\r\ntemporarily slowed down their growth.\r\n\r\nJ.J. had placed himself in a difficult position for a youthful Tammany\r\nDemocrat, some day to be a magistrate; he might have been forgiven more\r\neasily had he received a larger fee. Though he had to be convinced that\r\nwe declined to have anything to do with political wire-pulling, he\r\nfought for us valiantly.\r\n\r\nNovember 20th we pleaded not guilty and trial was set for November 27th.\r\nJ.J. endeavored to have the three of us tried simultaneously, but the\r\nCourt of Special Sessions would have none of it. Then he asked for a\r\njury trial, which could be granted at the discretion of the Supreme\r\nCourt; application was denied. An appeal to the Appellate Division was\r\ndismissed; writs of habeas corpus were dismissed; another appeal to the\r\nAppellate Division was dismissed; adjournments pending appeal were urged\r\nbut not granted. Indeed I was being swiftly educated in the\r\ntechnicalities of criminal law.\r\n\r\nI felt like a victim who passed into the courtroom, was made to bow\r\nbefore the judge, and did not know what it was all about. Every gesture\r\nhad its special significance, which must not be left out if appeals were\r\nto be possible. We had to make many more appearances than would\r\notherwise have been necessary; everything had to be correctly on the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nEvening after evening J.J. rehearsed the arguments he was going to\r\npresent and directed me to respond to questioning. I did not understand\r\nthe technicalities and begged to be allowed to tell the story in my own\r\nway, fearful lest the heartaches of the mothers be lost in the\r\nlabyrinthine maze of judicial verbiage. But he maintained if the case\r\nwere to be appealed to a higher court, it had to be conducted according\r\nto certain formalities.\r\n\r\n“Why should it have to be in legal language?” I demanded. “I’m a simple\r\ncitizen, born in a democratic country. A court should also listen to my\r\nplea expressed in plain language for the common people. I’m sure I can\r\nmake them understand and arouse their compassion.”\r\n\r\nHe reiterated that I could not address a court as though I were trying\r\nto instil my views in an individual. “You can’t talk to them that way.\r\nYou’ll have to let me talk.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s the way I talk and I’m the accused.”\r\n\r\nI fully expected that if I were permitted to set forth my human version\r\nof the Brownsville tragedies, no appeal would be required. But J.J. knew\r\nthe courts and had no such hopes. He was still doubtful of any success\r\nbefore the lower tribunal, and was still unable to see my point,\r\ncounting chiefly on technicalities to win the case.\r\n\r\nJ.J. had formally objected to having our trial set during the November\r\nsession because Justice McInerney was due to preside that month, and at\r\nprevious trials he had expressed biased opinions. This objection was\r\noverruled.\r\n\r\nThe strictly legal method having failed, I resorted to my own and wrote\r\nJustice McInerney an open letter:\r\n\r\n  As an American pledged to the principles and spirit in which this\r\n  Republic was founded, as a judge obligated by oath to fair and\r\n  impartial judgment, do you in your deepest conscience consider\r\n  yourself qualified to try my case?\r\n\r\n  In those birth control cases at which you have presided, you have\r\n  shown to all thinking men and women an unfailing prejudice and\r\n  exposed a mind steeped in the bigotry and intolerance of the\r\n  Inquisition.\r\n\r\n  To come before you implies conviction.\r\n\r\nJudge McInerney “made application to the District Attorney to be taken\r\noff this case.”\r\n\r\nTrial was marked for January 4, 1917, but the first case, that of Ethel,\r\nwas reached so late in the afternoon it had to be postponed. Four days\r\nafterwards, in spite of our attempts to be tried together, she appeared\r\nalone. She freely admitted she had described birth control methods but\r\ndenied the District Attorney’s accusation that our ten-cent registration\r\nfee made it a “money making” affair. This and other sensational charges,\r\nsuch as “the clinic was intended to do away with the Jews” were often\r\ninserted in the records for reporters to pick up, make good stories of\r\nthem, and in consequence influence newspaper readers against us. They\r\nwere great stumbling blocks.\r\n\r\nOur most important witness, Dr. Morris H. Kahn, physician in\r\nBloomingdale’s Department Store who also maintained a private clinic\r\nwhere he gave out birth control information, was ready to testify, but\r\nhis evidence was ruled out as “irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial.”\r\nTo be sure the charge against Ethel was as a lay person; nevertheless,\r\nit was extraordinary that we could get no hearing for a doctor. J.J. was\r\nallowed only fifteen minutes to present his argument on the\r\nunconstitutionality of Section 1142, and the presiding Judge decided\r\nthat the court was bound to hold it constitutional on precedent,\r\nregardless of argument.\r\n\r\nEthel was found guilty.\r\n\r\nIn the two weeks before sentence was to be pronounced we debated what\r\nshe and I should do. Perhaps it could be stayed, which would settle\r\neverything, but we each had to be prepared for either a short term of\r\nimprisonment or a long one. In case of the former, submission was the\r\nwiser course, because the public would not consider it of sufficient\r\nmoment to bestir itself; in the latter event, a hunger strike seemed\r\nindicated, but, again, only if sufficient attention could be called to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_ had the most liberal policy of all the leading\r\nmorning dailies, and therefore appeared to offer the best likelihood of\r\nbeing favorably disposed. I approached one of its editors and asked\r\nwhether he would print our entire story if I were to give him a scoop\r\nand guarantee accuracy. He agreed, and assigned us a special reporter.\r\n\r\nEthel was sentenced January 22nd to thirty days in the Workhouse on\r\nBlackwell’s Island in the East River. In spite of our discussion over\r\nthis possibility, she was utterly shocked, and exclaimed, “I’m going to\r\ngo on that hunger strike.”\r\n\r\nAfter spending the night in the Tombs, she was returned the next morning\r\nto the Federal District Court of Brooklyn on a writ of habeas corpus as\r\na means of suspending sentence pending appeal. Daylight had brought no\r\nchange in her determination to continue with the hunger strike. “I\r\nhaven’t had anything to eat yet,” she declared, and, remembering the\r\ntale that one hunger striker had received nourishment in her cups of\r\nwater, she added, “and, if they send me back, I shan’t drink anything\r\neither.”\r\n\r\nNeither J.J. nor I considered such a short sentence worth breaking your\r\nlife for. Furthermore, the cause did not mean to Ethel what it did to\r\nme. “Think this over very carefully,” I reminded her. “A hunger strike\r\nis not necessary, and if you once start you’ll have to keep it up.” She\r\ninsisted that she was ready to die if need be; she had made her will and\r\narranged for the disposition of her two children—the hunger strike was\r\nto go on. The writ was refused and she was remanded to the Workhouse. On\r\nher way there she told the women with whom she shared the patrol wagon\r\nthe salient facts of birth control.\r\n\r\nWhen Commissioner of Correction Burdette G. Lewis was asked to comment\r\non Ethel’s decision he scoffed. “Others have threatened hunger strikes.\r\nIt means nothing.” At first no food at all was brought her, but after\r\nthe publicity began the authorities were in despair to make her eat.\r\nThis was a case they did not know how to handle; they were mentally\r\nunprepared for prisoners who were guilty of performing a legal wrong in\r\norder to win a legal right.\r\n\r\nEthel had gone one hundred and three hours without eating when\r\nCommissioner Lewis established a precedent in American prison annals by\r\nordering her forcibly fed, the first woman to be so treated in this\r\ncountry. He stated optimistically to the press how simple the process\r\nwas, consisting of merely rolling her in a blanket so she could not\r\nstruggle, and then having milk, eggs, and a stimulant forced into her\r\nstomach through a rubber tube. He stressed how healthy she continued to\r\nbe, how little opposition she offered, how foolish the whole thing\r\nappeared to him anyhow; he was going to charge her for the expense\r\nincurred in calling in an expert to feed her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard my sister was “passive under the feeding” I became\r\ndesperately anxious about her; nothing but complete loss of strength\r\ncould have lessened her resistance.\r\n\r\nAfter one interview Commissioner Lewis had barred all reporters and\r\ngiven out a statement of his own. “I have not much patience with Mrs.\r\nByrne’s efforts to get advertising for her cause, and I won’t help such\r\na campaign along by issuing bulletins.”\r\n\r\nBut bulletins were being issued, nevertheless—and printed.\r\n\r\nFrom prearranged sources I was receiving messages and notes each\r\nevening, and reports on Ethel’s pulse and temperature. Thus I learned\r\nher vision was becoming affected and her heart was beginning to miss\r\nbeats, due to lack of liquids. “Going without water was pretty bad,” she\r\nsaid herself. “At night the woman whose duty it was to go up and down\r\nthe corridors to give the prisoners a drink if they wanted it stopped\r\nright by my cell and cried, ‘Water! Water!’ till it seemed as if I could\r\nnot stand it. And on the other side of me was the sound of the river\r\nthrough the window.”\r\n\r\nNobody was allowed to visit Ethel but J.J., who, as her lawyer, could\r\nnot well be refused. But reporters have their own mysterious ways of\r\ngetting what they want. The _World_ man succeeded in reaching her. It\r\nwas not on the whole a successful interview, because she did not know\r\nwho he was, but it did have one important result—it confirmed at first\r\nhand our statements as to the seriousness of her condition.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my anxiety over Ethel, my own trial opened January 29th\r\nin the same bare, smoky, upstairs Brooklyn court in which she had\r\nappeared. Justices John J. Freschi, Italian, Moses Herrmann, Jewish, and\r\nGeorge J. O’Keefe, Irish, sat on the bench. Judge Freschi, a rather\r\nyoung man, presided, and on him we pinned our hopes. We did not expect\r\nanything of old Judge Herrmann except that, because he was Jewish, he\r\nmight be broad-minded. As to Judge O’Keefe we had no illusions.\r\n\r\nNo less than thirty of the mothers of Brownsville had been subpoenaed by\r\nthe prosecution, but about fifty arrived—some equipped with fruit,\r\nbread, pacifiers, and extra diapers, others distressed at having had to\r\nspend carfare, timid at the thought of being in court, hungry because no\r\nkosher food could be obtained near by. Nevertheless, all smiled and\r\nnodded at me reassuringly.\r\n\r\nFormerly, a few women of wealth but of liberal tendencies had been\r\nactively concerned in the movement, but now some who were prominent\r\nsocially were coming to believe on principle that birth control should\r\nnot be denied to the masses. The subject was in the process of ceasing\r\nto be tagged as radical and revolutionary, and becoming admittedly\r\nhumanitarian.\r\n\r\nIn this room, side by side with the ones to be helped, sat new helpers.\r\nAmong them was Mrs. Amos Pinchot, Chairman of the Women’s Committee of\r\nOne Hundred, formed to lend support to the defense. Her reddish hair\r\nbetrayed a temper quick and easily aroused in the cause of justice.\r\nAristocratic of bearing, autocratic by position, she was one to command\r\nand be obeyed, and was easily a leading personality in the philanthropic\r\nsmart set of New York. Among her valuable services was the bringing into\r\nthe fold of the mothers and aunts of the present active Junior Leaguers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lewis L. Delafield’s limousine stood in front of the doors at\r\nalmost every trial and it meant a great deal to the defendants to have\r\nthe wife of one of the most eminent members of the New York bar in the\r\ncourtroom. By her very demeanor and looks—white-haired, a fragile\r\ncountenance—you knew she could touch nothing that was not fine, and that\r\nshe had the spiritual courage to stand by her ideas and ideals in both\r\nher public and private life. Always she opened her home and her heart\r\nand her arms to those she loved.\r\n\r\nFania was called first. She was a girl with a pale and delicate face,\r\nand was too worried to bear the strain. She should not be punished for\r\nco-operating, and I told J.J. to notify the court that she was not well,\r\nthough I strictly forbade him to say anything about my health. Her trial\r\nwas brief, narrowing itself down to whether _What Every Girl Should\r\nKnow_ was to be classed as indecent. A few days later she was found\r\nguilty and sentenced to fifty dollars’ fine, a decision which was\r\neventually reversed on appeal.\r\n\r\nIt surprised me that in my trial the prosecution should be carried on so\r\nvehemently, because the prosecutor had little to prove. To me there\r\nseemed to be no argument at all; the last thing in my mind was to deny\r\nhaving given birth control advice. Certainly I had violated the letter\r\nof the law, but that was what I was opposing.\r\n\r\nI grew more and more puzzled by the stilted language, the\r\ncircumlocutions, the respect for precedent. These legal battles, fought\r\nin a curiously unreal world, intensified my defiance to the breaking\r\npoint. I longed for a discussion in the open on merit and in simple,\r\nhonest terms.\r\n\r\nI thought I might have my wish when Judge Freschi, holding up a cervical\r\ncap which the prosecuting attorney had put in evidence, said, “Who can\r\nprove this is a violation; the law states that contraception is\r\npermitted for the prevention of disease. May it not be used for medical\r\nreasons?”\r\n\r\nThis question raised my hopes high. At last the law might be interpreted\r\naccording to the definition I so desired; ill health resulting from\r\npregnancy caused by lack of its use might be construed as disease.\r\n\r\nThen one by one the Brownsville mothers were called to the stand to\r\nanswer the District Attorney. “Have you ever seen Mrs. Sanger before?”\r\n\r\n“Yess. Yess, I know Mrs. Sanger.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you see her?”\r\n\r\n“At the cleenic.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you go there?”\r\n\r\n“To have her stop the babies.”\r\n\r\nThe witness bowed sweet acknowledgment to me until she was peremptorily\r\ncommanded to address the court.\r\n\r\n“Did you get this information?”\r\n\r\n“Yess. Yess, dank you, I got it. It wass gut, too.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” the District Attorney barked, and called another.\r\n\r\nTime after time they gave answers that were like nails to seal my doom,\r\nyet each thought she was assisting me.\r\n\r\nJ.J. saw how their testimony could be turned to our advantage.\r\n\r\nHe asked, “How many miscarriages have you had? How much sickness in your\r\nfamily? How much does your husband earn?” The answers were seven, eight,\r\nnine dollars a week.\r\n\r\nAt last one woman more miserable and more poverty-stricken than the rest\r\nwas summoned. “How many children have you?”\r\n\r\n“Eight and three that didn’t live.”\r\n\r\n“What does your husband earn?”\r\n\r\n“Ten dollars a veek—ven he vorks.”\r\n\r\nJudge Freschi finally exclaimed, “I can’t stand this any longer,” and\r\nthe court adjourned over the week-end.\r\n\r\nJ.J. was jubilant, because he said there was nothing for him to do; the\r\ncourt was arguing his case for him.\r\n\r\nI myself was feeling a little conscience-smitten. A mass meeting of\r\nsympathizers had been organized by the Committee of One Hundred for that\r\nevening in Carnegie Hall, and I went straight there from the courtroom.\r\nI had a speech ready in which I said we were being persecuted, not\r\nprosecuted; that the judges were no better than witch-burners. It was\r\nunfortunate, but copies had already been released to the press and the\r\nwording could not be changed.\r\n\r\nHelen Todd, the Chairman, a grand person who had been trained under Jane\r\nAddams, had given the mothers of Brownsville places of honor on the\r\nplatform to let everybody see what kind of women we were fighting for.\r\nShe asked for twenty volunteers to follow the example of the English\r\nsuffragettes who had gone on hunger strikes en masse, but no women whose\r\nnames registered socially in the public mind were willing thus to join\r\nin protesting against the law; only working girls came forward.\r\n\r\nThree days later Jessie Ashley and I took the train for Albany with Mrs.\r\nPinchot, who was a close friend of Governor Charles S. Whitman, to ask\r\nhim to appoint a commission to investigate birth control and make a\r\nreport to the State Legislature. The Governor, who was fair and\r\nintelligent, quite distinctly representing a class of liberal\r\npoliticians, received us cordially.\r\n\r\nEthel and her hunger strike had been front-page news for ten days; in\r\nthe subway, on street corners, everywhere people gathered, she was being\r\ndiscussed. In Washington and Albany congressmen and legislators were\r\nsending out for the latest details. Governor Whitman naturally asked\r\nabout her, and we seized the opportunity to try to impress on him the\r\noutrageousness of making her suffer for so just a cause. He said\r\ndirectly her incarceration was a disgrace to the State. He was entirely\r\nout of sympathy with the courts and judges, and offered a pardon\r\nconditional upon her ceasing to disseminate birth control information.\r\n\r\nBut I had not come to ask that favor.\r\n\r\n“My sister wouldn’t take a pardon,” I replied, much to the distress of\r\nMrs. Pinchot. However, I accepted gratefully his letter to the warden at\r\nBlackwell’s Island authorizing me to see her.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I appeared again before the court. During the three-day\r\ninterim the effect of the mothers’ testimony had evidently been effaced\r\nfrom the judges’ minds, and they were infuriated by my Carnegie Hall\r\ndenunciation. But far more detrimental to my hope of a new\r\ninterpretation was the prosecution’s introduction of a Federal agent who\r\nhad once confiscated a copy of _Family Limitation_ in which was the\r\npicture of this same cervical cap; he read aloud my advice to women to\r\nuse it as a means of preventing conception. Not even the most friendly\r\njudge could get away from the fact that I had intended a far broader\r\ndefinition than any permitted by the existing law.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution argued further that the constitutionality of Section\r\n1142 could not be challenged, because the exception for physicians in\r\nSection 1145 already guaranteed “liberty” to citizens. And, since I was\r\nnot a physician and consequently did not come under the exception, the\r\ncourt must, in any event, find me guilty. This they did.\r\n\r\nThe day had been so full that I was not able to avail myself of Governor\r\nWhitman’s permit to visit Ethel until evening, when Mr. and Mrs. Pinchot\r\ntook me in their car to the Workhouse. I remember how cold it was; the\r\ntrip on the ferry seemed to go on forever. But when we finally arrived,\r\nat the name of Pinchot, the friend of the Governor, doors swung open;\r\nofficialdom turned polite and courteous and salaamed us on our way.\r\n\r\nThe Pinchots remained below while I was sent up to Ethel’s cell, where\r\nshe was lying on her iron cot, dressed in readiness for her release. Her\r\nappearance shocked and horrified me. She had grown thin and emaciated,\r\nher eyes were sunken and her tongue swollen, high red spots stood out on\r\nher cheeks. She could not see me even across the narrow cell, knowing me\r\nonly by my voice. Hers was muffled as she whispered me to come nearer,\r\nher mind confused. “Liberty,” she kept repeating, “I want my liberty.”\r\n\r\nHer life was all that mattered to me now. I had to eat humble pie, and\r\nsaid to the matron I was going to telegraph Governor Whitman that she\r\nwas too ill to accept the conditions of the pardon for herself, but I\r\nwould promise on her behalf. I was told that he had already signed the\r\npardon, was on his way to New York, and to wait downstairs, please.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour we were informed Mrs. Byrne was coming down. I\r\nwent along the hallway to meet her. She was being held up by two\r\nattendants, the matron following with wraps. Her head was rolling from\r\nside to side, and I could see from the pallor of her face, especially\r\nfrom the pinched look of her nose and mouth, that she was losing\r\nconsciousness. I protested to the matron, but orders had been given and\r\nwere being obeyed; Commissioner Lewis wanted the newspaper pictures to\r\nshow her coming out on her feet.\r\n\r\nRunning back to the room where the Pinchots were sitting, I exclaimed,\r\n“She’s fainting!” Then Mrs. Pinchot clapped her hands imperiously and\r\ndirected the attendants to lay Ethel down immediately and bring a\r\nstretcher. A command from her worked like magic. She wrapped her own fur\r\ncoat around the pathetic figure and, as soon as Ethel felt the softness\r\nand warmth, she knew she was safe. We carried her over to my apartment\r\nto begin the protracted period of recuperation. Only after a year’s\r\nconvalescence was she able to take up a normal life again.\r\n\r\nBeing the real instigator, I had every reason to expect a longer term\r\nthan Ethel. Logically, her hunger strike had served its purpose; that\r\nform of strategy was closed. But personally I decided that, if I should\r\nreceive a year, I should do the same. On the other hand, if I were given\r\nthree months or less, I could study and make use of my time. J.J. had\r\nheard on reliable authority that if I were to change my plea to guilty,\r\nI could have a suspended sentence. To his mind freedom alone meant\r\nvictory, and he urged me to accept it if it were offered.\r\n\r\nThis, it developed, was the intention of the court when on Monday I was\r\ncalled back for sentence. Having Ethel off the front page had brought a\r\nsigh of relief of almost national scope. But all the publicity had had\r\nits effect on public opinion, and doubtless influenced the judges also\r\nto a certain extent. Since they could not agree to change the\r\ninterpretation of the law, they had been obliged to find me guilty, but\r\nthey did not really want to inflict punishment.\r\n\r\nThey were, however, extremely suspicious of our assertion that we were\r\ngoing to carry the case higher. Jessie Ashley, Ida Rauh, and Bolton Hall\r\nhad all been let off with fines on the understanding they proposed to\r\nappeal, and then they had not done so. Courts were beginning to assume\r\nthis was just a trick of birth control advocates, not meant in good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nI sat listening to what seemed an interminable discussion between J.J.\r\nand Judge Freschi over whether the appeal were going to be prosecuted in\r\na quick and orderly fashion, until I was nearly lulled to sleep.\r\nSuddenly my attention was caught by hearing J.J. declare that I would\r\n“promise not to violate the law.”\r\n\r\nMy mind clicked. It was not in my program to bargain for freedom. J.J.,\r\nknowing full well I would make no such promise, had planted himself in\r\nfront of me so the court could not see my belligerent face. He was\r\ntrying to act as a buffer and, at the same time, for fear of what I\r\nmight say, to avoid having me summoned to the stand. I tried to peer\r\naround him, but he shifted from side to side, obscuring my view. I\r\ntugged on his coat like a badly brought up child, but he took no notice.\r\nFinally one of the judges interposed, “Your client wishes to speak to\r\nyou, counselor.” I could be ignored no longer, and was called. “Margaret\r\nSanger, stand up.”\r\n\r\nHistory is written in retrospect, but contemporary documents must be\r\nconsulted; therefore I have gone to the official records for the facts.\r\nAfter all, one courtroom is much like another, and the attitude of one\r\njustice not so dissimilar from that of another. I was combating a mass\r\nideology, and the judges who were its spokesmen merged into a single\r\nvoice, all saying, “Be good and we’ll let you off.” This is what I\r\nheard:\r\n\r\n  You have been in court during the time that your counsel made the\r\n  statement that pending the prosecution of appeal neither you nor\r\n  those affiliated with you in this so called movement will violate\r\n  the law; that is the promise your counsel makes for you. Now, the\r\n  Court is considering extreme clemency in your case. Possibly you\r\n  know what extreme clemency means. Now, do you personally make that\r\n  promise?\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: Pending the appeal.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: If Mrs. Sanger will state publicly and openly that she\r\n  will be a law-abiding citizen without any qualifications whatsoever,\r\n  this Court is prepared to exercise the highest degree of leniency.\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: I’d like to have it understood by the gentlemen of\r\n  the Court that the offer of leniency is very kind and I appreciate\r\n  it very much. It is with me not a question of personal imprisonment\r\n  or personal disadvantage. I am today and always have been more\r\n  concerned with changing the law regardless of what I have to undergo\r\n  to have it done.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: Then I take it that you are indifferent about this matter\r\n  entirely.\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: No, I am not indifferent. I am indifferent as to the\r\n  personal consequences to myself, but I am not indifferent to the\r\n  cause and the influence which can be attained for the cause.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: Since you are of that mind, am I to infer that you intend\r\n  to go on in this matter, violating the law, irrespective of the\r\n  consequences?\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: I haven’t said that. I said I am perfectly willing\r\n  not to violate Section 1142—pending the appeal.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE HERRMANN: The appeal has nothing to do with it. Either you\r\n  do or you don’t.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: (to Mr. Goldstein) What is the use of beating around the\r\n  bush? You have communicated to me in my chambers the physical\r\n  condition of your client, and you told me that this woman would\r\n  respect the law. This law was not made by us. We are simply here to\r\n  judge the case. We harbor no feeling against Mrs. Sanger. We have\r\n  nothing to do with her beliefs, except in so far as she carries\r\n  those beliefs into practice and violates the law. But in view of\r\n  your statement that you intend to prosecute this appeal and make a\r\n  test case out of this and in view of the fact that we are to regard\r\n  her as a first offender, surely we want to temper justice with mercy\r\n  and that’s all we are trying to do. And we ask her, openly and above\r\n  board, “Will you publicly declare that you will respect the law and\r\n  not violate it?” and then we get an answer with a qualification.\r\n  Now, what can the prisoner at the bar for sentence expect? I don’t\r\n  know that a prisoner under such circumstances is entitled to very\r\n  much consideration after all.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: (to the Defendant) We don’t want you to do impossible\r\n  things, Mrs. Sanger, only the reasonable thing and that is to comply\r\n  with this law as long as it remains the law. It is the law for you,\r\n  it is the law for me, it is the law for all of us until it is\r\n  changed; and you know what means and avenues are open to you to have\r\n  it changed, and they are lawful ways. You may prosecute these\r\n  methods, and no one can find fault with you. If you succeed in\r\n  changing the law, well and good. If you fail, then you have to bow\r\n  in submission to the majority rule.\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: It is just the chance, the opportunity to test it.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: Very good. You have had your day in court; you advocated\r\n  a cause, you were brought to the bar, you wanted to be tried here,\r\n  you were judged, you didn’t go on the stand and commit perjury in\r\n  any sense, you took the facts and accepted them as true, and you are\r\n  ready for judgment, even the worst. Now, we are prepared, however,\r\n  under all the circumstances of this case, to be extremely lenient\r\n  with you if you will tell us that you will respect this law and not\r\n  violate it again.\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: I have given you my answer.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: We don’t want any qualifications. We are not concerned\r\n  with the appeal.\r\n\r\n  MR. GOLDSTEIN: Just one other statement, your Honor, one final\r\n  statement on my part. Your Honor did well say that you didn’t want\r\n  anything unreasonable. With all due deference to your Honor, to ask\r\n  a person what her frame of mind will be with so many exigencies in\r\n  future, that is, if the commission did nothing or the Legislature\r\n  did nothing—\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: All we are concerned about is this statute, and as long\r\n  as it remains the law will this woman promise here and now\r\n  unqualifiedly to respect it and obey it? Now, it is yes or no. What\r\n  is your answer, Mrs. Sanger? Is it yes or no?\r\n\r\n  THE DEFENDANT: I can’t respect the law as it stands today.\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: Margaret Sanger, there is evidence that you established\r\n  and maintained a birth control clinic where you kept for sale and\r\n  exhibition to various women articles which purported to be for the\r\n  prevention of conception, and that there you made a determined\r\n  effort to disseminate birth control information and advice. You have\r\n  challenged the constitutionality of the law under consideration and\r\n  the jurisdiction of this Court. When this is done in an orderly way\r\n  no one can find fault. It is your right as a citizen.... Refusal to\r\n  obey the law becomes an open defiance of the rule of the majority.\r\n  While the law is in its present form, defiance provokes anything but\r\n  reasonable consideration. The judgment of the Court is that you be\r\n  confined to the Workhouse for the period of thirty days.\r\n\r\nA single cry, “Shame!” was followed by a sharp rap of the gavel, and\r\nsilence fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chapter Nineteen_\r\n\r\n                        THIS PRISON WHERE I LIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nI sat in the front row while the court routine continued. The room\r\nbuzzed with conversation. J.J. was busy with formalities; reporters were\r\nleaning over to ask me questions. Through the near-by doorway I saw\r\nseveral young men awaiting their sentences like actors in the wings\r\nlistening for their cues. One was propped against the wall smoking a\r\ncigarette. At the sound of his name he raised his head, signifying he\r\nhad heard, and yet kept on smoking. When it was called a second time an\r\nattendant shoved him forward roughly. I could almost feel the hardening\r\nof his soul under this brutal attitude and the physical handling. He\r\ngave still another puff; then deliberately dropped the stub, stepped on\r\nit, and sauntered leisurely forward to receive his sentence.\r\n\r\nI was led into an anteroom where other prisoners were being put through\r\nthe regular fingerprinting procedure. I refused; there was a definite\r\nconnection in my mind between admission of guilt and fingerprinting;\r\nboth in their different ways placed me in the category of criminals. My\r\nrefractoriness was reported to the court. But the judges, poor dears,\r\nhad worn themselves out trying to avoid sending me to jail and were\r\nexasperated and cross; one more rebellion was too much for them. “Don’t\r\nbother us with that. It’s not our job. Take her away.”\r\n\r\nWe were then herded through the rear of the building into an open yard\r\nwhere the van was standing. The careless youth who had answered the\r\ncourt’s call with such unconcern was waving farewell to friends who\r\nloitered outside.\r\n\r\n“How long, Alf?” asked one.\r\n\r\n“Five years,” and he laughed as he said it.\r\n\r\nTwo more boys, their arms fraternally flung across one another’s\r\nshoulders, shouted, “Three!” and, “Four!” consecutively. Were they\r\nnormal? Could liberty be of so little account? The muscles in my throat\r\ncontracted as I pictured the maternal love once spent on their infancy,\r\nand now the reckless disregard for freedom culminating in this ride.\r\nThirty days seemed to me the end of the world, but they made light of\r\nmarking time in life for years, calling this their “sleeping time.” They\r\npaid no attention to me; I was entirely out of their realm.\r\n\r\nThe women huddled beside me were more serious. An hysterical and tearful\r\n“one-monther” had been obliged to leave her small four-year-old son\r\nsitting on the veranda watching for her return. She had not even been\r\nallowed to go back to see him and arrange for his care during her\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nSome experiences, though unexpected, are nevertheless partially\r\nanticipated in the subconscious. I had believed fully and firmly that\r\nsome miracle would occur to keep me from going to jail. There had been\r\nno miracle. The doors banged shut, two blue uniforms stared stolidly at\r\neach other, the automobile jerked forward.\r\n\r\nThe trip to Raymond Street was short. We were ushered into a waiting\r\nroom. A thin-lipped attendant of huge size callously pushed one weeping\r\ngirl through the door.\r\n\r\n“Get ready there, you!” she tossed over her shoulder at me.\r\n\r\n“For what?”\r\n\r\n“For the doctor.” I sat still. She repeated, “Do you hear me? Go in and\r\nget your examination!”\r\n\r\nI resented this attitude with every fiber of my being and replied, “I’m\r\nnot being examined.”\r\n\r\n“Ho, you’re not? You’re one of the fighting kind, are you? Well, we’ll\r\nsoon fix you, young lady!”\r\n\r\nShe swung her heavy, massive frame out the door, leaving me wondering,\r\nbut quivering with excited determination. I was not sure what would\r\nhappen to me. Within five minutes, however, she came back with an\r\nentirely different manner and tone. “Oh, you’re Mrs. Sanger. It’s all\r\nright. Come this way, please.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was given a cup of bitter, turbid, lukewarm coffee,\r\nand then placed inside the van, which set off for the Workhouse. There\r\nall my possessions were taken from me. A long wait. The men were sent\r\nsomewhere and the women somewhere else, I did not know where. I just\r\nsat. After what seemed hours my belongings were returned and a woman in\r\ncoat and hat told me to follow her. I did. A man added himself to our\r\nparty, and the three of us climbed into another van. We were driven some\r\ndistance down the Island, then put into a boat and ferried over to New\r\nYork. I had no idea where we were going. I asked but could elicit no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nWe took a street car and after various transfers I caught sight of a\r\nLoose-Wiles biscuit sign. But it did not help me because I had not seen\r\nit before; the section was unfamiliar to me. In early afternoon we\r\nreached the Queens County Penitentiary, Long Island City. Evidently the\r\nWorkhouse authorities had had enough of the Higgins family and wanted no\r\nmore responsibility of this nature.\r\n\r\nWarden Joseph McCann, who met me, was a jovial young Irishman who had\r\nrisen from the police ranks. “Have you had any lunch?” he asked. The\r\ncause of his solicitude emerged when he inquired anxiously whether I\r\nintended to go on a hunger strike. Remembering my morning cup of coffee,\r\nI replied, “Not unless your food is too bad.” He introduced Mrs.\r\nSullivan, the motherly matron.\r\n\r\nI answered the usual interrogatory about where I was born, how old I\r\nwas, etc., etc. When the clerk came to “What religion?” I replied,\r\n“Humanity.” He had never heard of this form of belief, and rephrased the\r\nquestion. “Well, what church do you go to?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in sharp surprise. All inmates of the penitentiary went\r\nto church; ninety-eight percent in my corridor had been reared as\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nThe prison clothing which I was handed was much like a nurse’s uniform\r\nand did not disturb me. But when I was recalled to the warden’s office\r\nto be fingerprinted, I said flatly I would not submit. He sent me back\r\nto my cell.\r\n\r\nThe floor was arranged rather on the order of a hospital ward, with\r\nlittle alcoves of ten or fifteen cells running off the gallery. Mine,\r\nNumber 210, was small but clean. I had a bed, toilet, and washstand.\r\nThere was no chair; I sat on my bunk.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners were at work except Josephine, a German Catholic who\r\nhad lost her husband and three children within a short period. She was\r\neager to tell me her story. A few days after they had died, she had gone\r\nto their graves and covered those of the children with blankets to keep\r\nthem warm. Someone saw her, decided she was insane, and had her\r\ncommitted to jail. It was a spring day when she was let out on parole.\r\nShe was pleased and happy. A hurdy-gurdy was playing her favorite tune,\r\n_Just As the Sun Went Down_. She paid the man a nickel to play it over,\r\nthen another, and another, and another. The policeman at the corner,\r\nhearing it, looked her over and arrested her again. During her next ten\r\ndays in prison she nursed a grievance against this injustice and, as\r\nsoon as she came out, had several drinks, went after the policeman,\r\nscratched his face, and tore his buttons off.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Josephine drank whenever she could, and each time she drank\r\nshe fought, and, since she had developed a complex against policemen,\r\nshe landed back in jail in short order; she had been in some seventy\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nI found Josephine a kind, big-hearted person, and, though erratic,\r\nfairly intelligent. She had a terrible tongue and a terrible temper, and\r\nundoubtedly had periods when she was of unsound mind. Most people were\r\nfrightened of her.\r\n\r\nShe was supposed to put curses on her enemies, and they came true. Once\r\na person who had treated her badly and been cursed in consequence had\r\npromptly contracted pneumonia and died. At another time the matron of a\r\ncertain jail had kept her three weeks in a dark cell on bread and water.\r\nAfter the fifth day, when bread was handed into the hole, she said it\r\ntasted like cake it was so sweet. From the two or three cups of water\r\ndaily, she had to assuage her thirst, wash her face, and clean her\r\nteeth. When she came out of this Stygian place she could scarcely see,\r\nbut she managed to distinguish the matron sufficiently to put the curse\r\nof God upon her. The next night someone forgot to close the door of the\r\nelevator shaft, and the matron walked through the open gate, fell to the\r\nbottom, and was instantly killed. Now, Josephine was let alone.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my depression I was intensely interested in Josephine; she\r\nbegged me to help her, and I said I would try. The rest of that\r\nafternoon was consumed in this tale of woe until at five o’clock I began\r\nmy initiation into the prison routine of hours and meals. The dining\r\nroom was filled with long tables and wooden benches. No one had a knife\r\nor fork—only a tablespoon, edge blunted so as to be unserviceable as a\r\nweapon. Supper consisted of tea and molasses, stewed dried peaches, and\r\ntwo slices of bread which tasted queer; it was said to have saltpeter in\r\nit. We were locked in an hour later; lights were out at nine. Bells\r\nbegan ringing at six the next morning, and the cells were opened at\r\nseven. For breakfast we had oatmeal with salt and milk, again two slices\r\nof the same bread, and coffee without sugar. Dinner was more bread, a\r\nboiled potato with the skin half on, and a sorry hunk of meat.\r\n\r\nBecause of my active tuberculosis the prison doctor soon put me on what\r\nwas called a diet. This meant I could have crackers and milk and tea in\r\nmy cell instead of going to the supper table. Due probably to the\r\ninfluence of the Osborne innovations at Sing Sing the men at the Queens\r\nPenitentiary were better treated than the women. Their food was of\r\nhigher quality and they could buy tobacco and even newspapers. The sole\r\nreading matter available to women were two Catholic weeklies and the\r\n_Christian Science Monitor_. Our only other news came from the two\r\nvisitors a month allowed. So fine a mesh screen was placed in the\r\nreception room that inmates could with difficulty distinguish, as\r\nthrough a veil, the features of those to whom they were talking. This\r\nwas a hardship not even imposed at Sing Sing.\r\n\r\nAfter morning cell-cleaning we took a fifteen-minute walk in the yard\r\nwith our hooded capes over our heads. During this cold tramp the women\r\nscanned the ground avidly for butts of cigarettes tossed away by the\r\nmen. It was tragic to see human beings forced to such a low level as to\r\ndig with their fingers in the frozen earth to retrieve these mangled\r\nstubs. Each used to grab her little bit and hide it.\r\n\r\nWhen the matron went to her lunch we were locked in our corridors but\r\nnot in our cells. Ordinarily she took a nap afterwards, and the girls\r\ncould usually count on her not being back until three or perhaps four\r\no’clock. This gave them an opportunity to dry their shreds of tobacco\r\nunder the radiator, then wrap them in toilet paper ready for smoking. At\r\nnight when we were all locked in they struck the steel ribs from their\r\ncorsets against the stone floor, and thus ignited pieces of cotton to\r\ngive them lights. I could see tiny glowing points in the darkness as\r\nthey puffed away greedily.\r\n\r\nSomehow, with the ingenuity born of necessity, these women also managed\r\nto have smuggled in to them occasional small news items. The first day\r\none of the girls approached me and in a stage whisper demanded, “Cross\r\nyour heart and hope to die you won’t tell.”\r\n\r\nI crossed my heart and hoped to die.\r\n\r\nShe slipped into my hand a short clipping about my trial. Apparently\r\nothers had been keeping up with events, because a few minutes later\r\nLisa, a little colored girl, called out, “You’se eats, don’t yer?”\r\n\r\nA third asked me to explain to them what “sex hygiene” was all about.\r\nAccordingly I sought permission of Mrs. Sullivan to be allowed in their\r\ncorridor during her dinner hour.\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“The girls want me to tell them about sex hygiene.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, gwan wid ye,” she laughed. “They know bad enough already.”\r\n\r\nSome of the most lovely-looking girls were drug addicts. It seemed\r\nmonstrous that the State could take such liberties with human lives as\r\nto convict them as criminals and sentence them to as much as three years\r\nfor something which should have been considered disease.\r\n\r\nOther women were pickpockets, embezzlers, prostitutes, keepers of\r\nbrothels, “Tiffany,” or high-class thieves, accomplices of safe blowers,\r\nand a few “transatlantic flyers,” who assisted in big hauls from Paris\r\nor London.\r\n\r\nThe class snobbishness among the offenders interested me beyond words.\r\nNo one cared how or where another had been reared, what kind of family\r\nbackground or education she had; the nature of her offense was the key\r\nto her social position. The one who picked pockets was scorned by the\r\ngirl who helped herself to pearl or diamond necklaces; the shoplifter\r\ndid not “sell her body.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoners sometimes slid their arms in mine as we paced along in the\r\nyard. One took me to task. “I saw you walking with Gracie. You mustn’t\r\nassociate with her.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what she’s in here for? She’s a petty thief. Whenever she\r\ngets out she rides in street cars and steals money from the pocketbooks\r\nof poor people going to pay their rent, or women coming home with their\r\nhusbands’ wages.”\r\n\r\n“And what are you here for?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I steal from the rich; I take only from people who have jewelry and\r\nbank accounts.”\r\n\r\nI never did the regular work of cleaning, not even my own cell. Nor was\r\nI sent into the workshop to sew or to operate the machines with the\r\nothers. When I asked Mrs. Sullivan why, she replied jollily, “Oh, you\r\nlook better over there with a pen in your hand.”\r\n\r\nShe had fixed up a table to serve as a desk, and there I sat the entire\r\nday with my papers and books, planning ahead and reading countless\r\nletters; the tenor of all was much like this from Sarah Goldstein:\r\n\r\n  The women here in Brownsville need help very bad. Mrs. Sanger has\r\n  got put away in the penitentiary for being friends with us, but she\r\n  said we was to use her place while she was gone. If we can have a\r\n  meeting over here in the clinic, I will put a fire in the stove and\r\n  ask the women to come Saturday.\r\n\r\n  We women here want to find out what the President, the Mayor, and\r\n  the Judges and everybody is trying to do. First they put Mrs. Sanger\r\n  in jail for telling us women how not to have any more children, and\r\n  then they get busy for the starve of the ones we’ve got. First they\r\n  take the meat and the egg, then the potato, the onion, and the milk,\r\n  and now the lentils and the butter, and the children are living on\r\n  bread and tea off the tea leaves that is kept cooking on the back of\r\n  the stove.\r\n\r\n  Honest to God, we ought to call a meeting and do something about it.\r\n\r\nPart of my time also was devoted to helping some of the girls to read or\r\nto write the two letters a month permitted them. I had not believed that\r\nany American-born of sixteen to eighteen years of age could be\r\nilliterate, but there were at least ten.\r\n\r\nI had been in the penitentiary for several days before I noticed a tall,\r\nerect woman with white hair and a face which obviously did not belong\r\nthere; I had never seen her in the yard or at table. Although she had\r\nbeen over nine months sharing the other prisoners’ food and working\r\nbeside them she had not become one of them. Because of her aloofness I\r\nfound it hard to make her acquaintance, but ultimately “the Duchess,” as\r\nshe was called, told me her story.\r\n\r\nAfter having been a teacher for fifteen years, she had married a\r\nminister who lived on a pension. They stayed in hotels, always spending\r\nmore than their income, while he steadily drew on his insurance money.\r\nHis sudden death left her practically penniless. Due to her age and the\r\nfact she had not taught for so long her application for a teacher’s job\r\nwas refused. She continued in the hotel until she had used up everything\r\nand was forced to move. Thereafter, she went from hotel to hotel,\r\nfleeing each time angry looks and bills; finally she was arrested and\r\ngiven an indeterminate sentence of from one to three years.\r\n\r\nHer constant brooding over her past was not preparing her for any\r\nfuture. I suggested she might keep her hand in by instructing the\r\nilliterate girls, and asked J.J., my only visitor, to have his friend\r\nWilliam Spinney send some primers and lower grade text-books from Henry\r\nHolt and Company where he worked; this was done free of charge. The\r\nDuchess was contentedly happy from the day she began teaching again.\r\n\r\nIn the desire to learn whether the girls’ background might not be\r\nrelated to the causes of their imprisonment, I asked Warden McCann\r\nwhether I could see the records, especially as to the size of the\r\nfamilies from which they came. He said it was against the rules, but he\r\nwas willing to give me such facts separately, assuring me I was going to\r\nbe surprised and disappointed. I was.\r\n\r\nWhen I inquired, “How many brothers and sisters does Rosie have?” the\r\nanswer was, “None.”\r\n\r\n“And Marie?”\r\n\r\n“She had a brother, but he’s dead.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the entries that all these women had been single\r\nchildren or, if a brother or sister had been born, he or she no longer\r\nsurvived. This was difficult to believe, but I had to accept it at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I became better acquainted with the old-timers they told\r\nme quite a different history. The registers were merely evidence of the\r\nunwritten rule among them to keep their families out of it.\r\n\r\nThe madam of a house of assignation was putting her daughter of\r\nseventeen through a fashionable boarding school. To prevent the child\r\nfrom knowing anything about her occupation she wrote letters, sent them\r\nWest, where she was supposed to be traveling, and had them redirected to\r\nthe school. Many other prisoners were mothers also, and the scheming and\r\nplanning to hide the painful knowledge of their whereabouts was worthy\r\nof the deepest admiration.\r\n\r\nOne after another admitted she had given false statements to save her\r\nrelatives from disgrace or constant annoyance by the police. The result\r\nof a poll of the thirty-one in our corridor showed an average of seven\r\nchildren to each girl’s family.\r\n\r\nI was always interested to know why the pretty ones were there. Frances,\r\none of the loveliest, had a radiant color, rosebud mouth, and the most\r\ninnocent eyes; she even managed to wear her apron with a Gallic chic. It\r\ndid not seem possible she could have committed a crime, but she turned\r\nout to be one of the rogues who made a practice of frequenting\r\ngatherings where careless people offered opportunities to pickpockets.\r\nShe told me how she, with two other girls, had once gone to an up-State\r\nfair. After making a grand haul of watches and purses and anything they\r\ncould lay their hands upon, her two companions said, “We’ve got enough.\r\nWe’re clearing out.”\r\n\r\nBut Frances had spotted an easy-looking wallet. It was not quite easy\r\nenough. Unfortunately for her the owner shouted, “Somebody’s stolen my\r\nmoney!”\r\n\r\nA bystander pointed, “She did it. I’ve been in three places today where\r\nthings have been lost, and she’s been there every time.”\r\n\r\nOther people gathered round. Frances began to cry. Because the friends\r\nof the man who had been robbed and he himself insisted she must be\r\narrested the police were called.\r\n\r\nFrances continued to weep until several lusty young farmers were ready\r\nto defy her accusers. How could they say such things about such a sweet\r\ngirl! It looked as though a fight were imminent, and she hoped to slip\r\naway during the excitement. But the police arrived too soon and took her\r\nto the station. They found nothing on her; somehow she had rid herself\r\nof the wallet.\r\n\r\nFrances’ new-found allies were ready to go her bail, but it so happened\r\nthat a police chief from a neighboring town who had come to the fair for\r\nthe express purpose of identifying possible petty criminals recognized\r\nher from his sheaf of photographs of habitual offenders. He said to her\r\nsupporters, “Boys, you’re crazy. This girl’s as crooked as a snake.\r\nHere’s her picture!”\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re crazy yourself! Your girl’s a blonde, and this one’s dark.”\r\n\r\nThe chief snatched at Frances’ hair, and off came her wig. As she told\r\nme this great joke on herself she shook with merriment.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of the story. The station captain had been\r\ninfluenced by her attractiveness and, since the wallet had not actually\r\nbeen discovered on her, wanted to let her off. He made a compromise.\r\n“I’m going to give you a ticket to Montreal. You either go to jail or\r\ntake it and get out.”\r\n\r\nShe accepted the ticket, but left the train at a near-by point and\r\nrejoined her friends at another fair. There, wearing a different\r\ncostume, she continued her trade. Although to look at her ingenuous face\r\nI could hardly believe it, pitting her wits against the police was to\r\nher a type of game.\r\n\r\nGertrude had been equally clever. She was of German origin, very\r\nstylish, moving in good circles when not in prison. She had learned that\r\nthe officers of the submarine, _Deutschland_, which had just crossed the\r\nocean, were to be entertained at a party. Having secured an invitation,\r\nshe devoted herself to a lieutenant who, she had discovered, was\r\ncarrying seven hundred dollars in his pocket. When the gathering broke\r\nup she took him back to his hotel in her car, suggesting they stop at a\r\nnight club en route. There she put a drug in his glass. It took a bit of\r\ntime to work, but after they had started on again he fell asleep. She\r\ngave five dollars to the doorman to take him to his room, saying he had\r\ndrunk a bit too much, and then went home.\r\n\r\nAt seven the following morning, while Gertrude and her little girl were\r\nstill in bed, the police raided her apartment. They could unearth\r\nnothing except what she could honestly account for. Her effects were\r\nturned upside down, and still no money was to be found.\r\n\r\n“Then how could they send you to jail?” I queried. “You didn’t take it,\r\ndid you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I did,” she asserted, looking at me as if I were dull-witted.\r\n“They couldn’t pin it on me, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nEven though Gertrude had been brighter than the police, she, like many\r\nof the others, had been convicted on her past record and the present\r\nsuspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nJosephine was another case in point. After I myself had been released I\r\nhad her paroled under her own recognizance and secured a place for her\r\nas chambermaid in a hotel. Fate so arranged that in the very first room\r\nshe entered on her first morning’s work she was confronted with the\r\ncorpse of a man who had died in his bed during the night. She rushed out\r\nimmediately, got drunk, and went directly back to jail again.\r\n\r\nThe resentment thus engendered in these caged women was like a strong,\r\nglowing flame, of a depth that I scarcely had believed possible. The\r\nshivers ran up and down my back when I heard the details of their\r\nunguided and loveless childhoods, which explained in large part the\r\ncurious manner in which their minds worked. They thought only in terms\r\nof getting away with their crimes, of beating the system—although their\r\npresence here was proof that it could not be beaten. Three of the\r\nyounger girls, too old for Bedford Reformatory but almost too young for\r\nthe penitentiary, definitely shocked me with their plans for wrong-doing\r\nwithout being apprehended. They asked me about my case. “Was it true the\r\njudge gave you a chance not to go to jail if you’d promise not to break\r\nthe law?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, why didn’t you do it?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t promise that.”\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t have to keep your promise!”\r\n\r\nThe ever-present bitterness arose, not from being caught in the act, but\r\nfrom being convicted without having been, according to their own belief,\r\nproved guilty. It was the woeful mental attitude rather than the actual\r\nphysical condition of their imprisonment which so appalled me. Not one\r\nof them intended to go straight. They hated the police who were drawing\r\ngood salaries from the State and getting credit for putting them in\r\njail; yet all the time they had been smarter. This sounds inconsistent,\r\nbut it was their peculiar psychological twist.\r\n\r\nI talked it over later with several judges to whom it was rather a new\r\npoint of view. Among other cases I cited that of a brothel keeper who\r\nconducted her house as a club and did it so carefully that no evidence\r\ncould be obtained against her. Therefore, a detective had put opium in\r\nthe plumbing and she had been sentenced on a narcotic charge, although\r\nit was well known this was not her offense.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners were guilty, weren’t they?” said one of the judges. “You\r\nknow that, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I rejoined, “but to my mind that doesn’t end the State’s\r\nresponsibility. It seems to me your detectives should be more\r\nintelligent than the criminals they are set to catch.”\r\n\r\nThe girls at Queens Penitentiary were unaware they were entitled to\r\nbring a far more serious charge against society than clumsy and inept\r\npolice methods. I have never since visited an institution for juvenile\r\noffenders without thinking how stupid people are not to recognize that\r\nmost adolescents are subjected to temptation on some occasion or other;\r\nthat anyone, in an emotional fragment of time, when young and when the\r\nconsequences are not clear, may do some forbidden thing. More often than\r\nnot it is merely incidental, and in no way warrants a life of penance.\r\n\r\nThe only brutal treatment I received was during the last two hours.\r\nSince my fingerprints had not been taken on arrival, Warden McCann first\r\ntried to talk me into compliance. His argument that all prisoners’\r\nprints must be on file, that not having them was unheard of, got us\r\nnowhere. I refused to submit, even though it postponed my release. He\r\nthen turned me over to two keepers. One held me, the other struggled\r\nwith my arms, trying to force my fingers down on the inkpad. I do not\r\nknow from what source I drew my physical strength, but I managed to\r\nprevent my hands from touching it. My arms were bruised and I was weak\r\nand exhausted when an officer at headquarters, where J.J. was protesting\r\nagainst the delay, telephoned an order to discharge me without the usual\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1917, dawned a bitter, stinging morning. Through the metal\r\ndoors I stepped, and the tingling air beat against my face. No other\r\nexperience in my life has been like that. Gathered in front were my old\r\nfriends who had frozen through the two hours waiting to celebrate\r\n“Margaret’s coming out party.” They lifted their voices in the\r\n_Marseillaise_. Behind them at the upper windows were my new friends,\r\nthe women with whom I had spent the month, and they too were singing.\r\nSomething choked me. Something still chokes me whenever I hear that\r\ntriumphant music and ringing words, “Ye sons of freedom wake to glory!”\r\n\r\nI plunged down the stairs and into the car which stood ready for me, and\r\nwe swept out of the yard towards my apartment. At the entrance were\r\nVito, the coal man, and his wife, beaming and proudly pointing to the\r\nblazing fire they had made on the hearth to welcome me home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Twenty_\r\n\r\n                     A STOUT HEART TO A STEEP HILL\r\n\r\n        “_When a thing ceases to be a subject of controversy, it\r\n        ceases to be a subject of interest._”\r\n\r\n                                                 WILLIAM HAZLITT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noisy clamor of the world could not reach me through thick stone\r\nwalls; prison had been a quiet interim for reflection, for assembling\r\npast experiences and preparing for the future. The tempestuous season of\r\nagitation—courts and jails and shrieking and thumbing-the-nose—should\r\nnow end. Heretofore there had been much notoriety and but little\r\nunderstanding. The next three steps were to be: first, education; then,\r\norganization; and, finally, legislation. All were clearly\r\ndifferentiated, though they necessarily overlapped to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nI based my program on the existence in the country of a forceful\r\nsentiment which, if co-ordinated, could become powerful enough to change\r\nlaws. Horses wildly careering around a pasture have as much strength as\r\nwhen harnessed to a plow, but only in the latter case can the strength\r\nbe measured and turned to some useful purpose. The public had to be\r\neducated before it could be organized and before the laws could be\r\nchanged as a result of that organization. I set myself to the task. It\r\nwas to be a long one, because the press did not want articles stating\r\nthe facts of birth control; they wanted news, and to them news still\r\nconsisted of fights, police, arrests, controversy.\r\n\r\nOne of the early essays in education was a moving picture dramatizing\r\nthe grim and woeful life of the East Side. Both Blossom and I believed\r\nit would have value, and I continue to be of the same mind. He had not\r\napproved of the clinic and had declined to have anything to do with it,\r\nbut was eager to join me in capitalizing on the ensuing publicity.\r\nTogether we wrote a scenario of sorts, concluding with the trial.\r\nAlthough I had long since lost faith in my abilities as an actress, I\r\nplayed the part of the nurse, and an associate of Blossom’s financed its\r\nproduction. But before it could appear Commissioner of Licenses George\r\nH. Bell ordered it suppressed.\r\n\r\nTo prove the film mirrored conditions which called for birth control, we\r\ngave a private showing at a theater, inviting some two hundred people\r\nconcerned with social welfare. All agreed the public should see it, and\r\nsigned a letter to that effect. Justice Nathan Bijur issued an\r\ninjunction against interfering with its presentation. The moving picture\r\ntheaters, however, fearful lest the breath of censure wither their\r\nprofits, were too timid to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nOf infinitely greater and more lasting significance than this venture\r\nwas the _Birth Control Review_, which, from 1917 to 1921, was the\r\nspearhead in the educational stage. It could introduce a quieter and\r\nmore scientific tone, and also enable me to keep in touch with people\r\neverywhere whose interest had already been evoked. Emotion was not\r\nenough; ideas were not enough; facts were what we needed so that leaders\r\nof opinion who were articulate and willing to speak out might have\r\nauthoritative data to back them up.\r\n\r\nThe first issue of the _Review_, prepared beforehand, had come out in\r\nFebruary, 1917, while I was in the penitentiary. It was not a very good\r\nmagazine then; it had few contributors and no editorial policy.\r\nAnyone—sculptor, spiritualist, cartoonist, poet, free lance—could\r\nexpress himself here; the pages were open to all. In some ways it was\r\nreminiscent of the old days of the _Woman Rebel_, when everybody used to\r\nlend a hand—always with this vital difference, that we held strictly to\r\neducation instead of agitation. I had learned a little editorial\r\nknowledge from my previous magazine efforts and now obtained a more\r\nprofessional touch from the newspaper men and women who gradually came\r\nin, among them William E. Williams, formerly of the Kansas City _Star_,\r\nWalter A. Roberts, who later published the few issues of the _American\r\nParade_, and Rob Parker, editor and make-up man. Among the associates\r\nwere Jessie Ashley, Mary Knoblauch, and Agnes Smedley.\r\n\r\nThat extraordinarily shy and mysterious woman, Agnes Smedley, had been\r\nborn in a covered wagon of squatter parents, and, though she had become\r\na teacher in the California public schools, her early habits of thought\r\nremained with her; she was consistently for the under dog. The British\r\nGovernment had suspected her of connection with the seditious activities\r\nof a group of Hindu students and persuaded the Federal authorities to\r\ninvestigate. All they had been able to find on which to charge her were\r\na few copies of _Family Limitation_. This brought her within our\r\nprovince, and when she was arraigned in New York John Haynes Holmes\r\nprocured her ten-thousand-dollar bail. After her acquittal she worked\r\nwith us at various times until she left for post-War Germany.\r\n\r\nOn this and other occasions John Haynes Holmes, a speaker second to\r\nnone, brought the convincing force of his arguments and mind to our aid.\r\nBy the shape of his head and the honesty of his eyes you could recognize\r\nthe practical idealist in this Unitarian minister. He never straddled\r\nissues. During the War he said if one flag were to be hung out his\r\nchurch windows, then those of all nations should be flown; no peoples\r\nwere enemies of his.\r\n\r\nTwo numbers of the _Review_ had appeared when the United States entered\r\nthe War and Blossom and I fell out. He was an ardent Francophile and,\r\nlike most masculine members of the intelligentsia, threw in his lot with\r\nthe Allies. I wrote a pacifist editorial; he refused to run it and\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nTo Blossom, as to so many others, pacifism was automatically labeled\r\npro-Germanism, on the old theory that “he who is not for me is against\r\nme.” I had already seen in Europe what propaganda could do to build up a\r\nwar spirit, and prayed every morning when I awoke that I could keep my\r\nhead clear and cool. I had heard the plaintive pleas of French mothers,\r\nbut had talked also with German mothers. In the hearts of none had there\r\nbeen hatred or desire for their sons to kill other sons.\r\n\r\nI knew what I thought about the War; it was so outrageous I would not be\r\nmixed up in it. I still believe it was not only a dreadful thing in\r\nitself—a slaughter and waste of human life—but, even more disastrous, it\r\nexterminated those who ought now to be ruling our national destinies\r\naccording to the pre-War liberality of thought in which they had been\r\nreared. We started at that time to walk backwards instead of forwards,\r\nand have retreated steadily ever since. A fear of expressing opinions\r\nwhich then began to seep in has gradually helped to impose censorship\r\nand further intolerance.\r\n\r\nI was neither pro-Ally nor pro-German but, using common sense, was\r\ndistressed at seeing German achievements torn into shreds. Intelligence\r\nin Germany had been focused on all fronts; she had the lowest illiteracy\r\nof any country and had invested heavily in mass education from which the\r\nrest of the world was benefiting at little cost. She had offered the\r\nbest training for graduate students in medicine; foreign travel had been\r\naccelerated by German linguists; commerce had been able to carry on\r\ninternational contacts through German interpreters; any foreign industry\r\nwhich had needed technical advice had usually employed a German\r\nscientist, engineer, or chemist who knew how to do his job and do it\r\nwell. Germany could not continue this policy without wanting to receive\r\nsome tangible return.\r\n\r\nI was convinced the primary cause of this war lay in the terrific\r\npressure of population in Germany. To be sure, her birth rate had\r\nrecently begun to decline, but her death rate, particularly infant\r\nmortality, had, through applied medical science, likewise been brought\r\nfar down. The German Government had to do something about the increase\r\nof her people. Underneath her rampant militarism, underneath her demand\r\nfor colonies was this driving economic force. She could hold no more,\r\nand had to burst her bounds.\r\n\r\nBlossom’s defection was one of the heart-breaking things that can creep\r\ninto any endeavor, even the most idealistic. I have seen so many young\r\ncrusaders come galloping to show me the way, joining the procession and\r\nblowing horns for “The Cause,” panting with enthusiasm to reform the\r\nworld, willing to teach me how to put the movement on a “social” or\r\n“sound practical and economic” basis. They were going to get vast\r\ncontributions so that money would roll unceasingly into our coffers. But\r\nif they lacked the necessary patience and forbearance, or were there for\r\npersonal aggrandizement, they became discouraged at the first show of\r\nthorny, disagreeable obstacles, retreating or deserting rather than\r\nfighting through.\r\n\r\nIn the birth control movement supporters have come and gone. When they\r\nremained they found work, work, work, and little recognition, reward, or\r\ngratitude. Those who desired honor or recompense, or who measured their\r\ninterest by this yardstick, are no longer here. It is no place for\r\nanything except the boundless love of giving. Blossom was the first\r\nillustration to me that the ones to whom authority is handed over are\r\nlikely to expand and explode unless they have selflessly dedicated\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe the three chief tests to character are sudden power,\r\nsudden wealth, and sudden publicity. Few can stand the latter; nothing\r\ngoes to the head with more violence. Seeing this all around me, I did\r\nnot subscribe to a clipping bureau until it seemed necessary for\r\nhistorical purposes. I did not even read the papers when unsought\r\nadvertisement was great, remembering that this could be but a nine days’\r\nwonder. Furthermore, news items were often distracting because the facts\r\nwere constantly embroidered just to make a good story, to paint a\r\nsituation according to the policy of the paper, or because they\r\nreflected the inhibitions of the reporters. Hours could have been\r\nentirely given over to denials and contradictions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of any emergency such as a police raid or the stopping of a\r\nmeeting my own emotions generally kept an even tenor; they did not go\r\nhopping up and down like a temperature. A nurse cannot afford to lose\r\nher head, and the control I had won in that training helped me, as did\r\nalso my father’s philosophy, “Since all things change, this too will\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, during this feverish period, neither public praise nor\r\npublic blame affected me very much, although the type of criticism that\r\ncame from friends was different. Just because they were friends and I\r\nwanted them to understand, I was unhappy if they did not. But, since\r\npersons one likes can have great influence and friendships take time, I\r\nrefrained from making many new ones. Nevertheless, those I had then are\r\nas good today; when we meet we pick up the threads where we dropped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe War halted the progress of the birth control movement temporarily.\r\nThe groups that had before been active now found new interests. The\r\nradicals were convulsed and their own ranks torn in two by the\r\nopposition to conscription. Influenza swept over the world and in its\r\npassage took off many of our old companions. Governor Whitman’s promised\r\ncommission blew up. One bright bugle sounded when I learned that the\r\nsection on venereal disease in _What Every Girl Should Know_, which had\r\nonce been banned in the New York _Call_ and for which Fania had been\r\nfined, was now, officially but without credit, reprinted and distributed\r\namong the soldiers going into cantonments and abroad. At home all felt\r\nthere was little to do but wait until people came back to their senses;\r\nthe _Review_ was the only forward step I could take at the time.\r\n\r\nLate in 1917 a new recruit was enlisted. Nobody ever knew Kitty Marion’s\r\ntrue name. She had been born in Westphalia, Germany, and when she was\r\nfifteen her father had whipped her once too often and she had run away\r\nto England, where eventually she had headed a turn at a music hall.\r\n\r\nThe London slums had aroused Kitty’s social conscience, and she had\r\nabandoned her own career to enroll with Mrs. Pankhurst in the suffrage\r\ncrusade, becoming one of the most determined of her followers. When put\r\nin jail she set fire to her cell, chewed a hole in her mattress, broke\r\nthe window, and upon being released threw bricks at Newcastle Post\r\nOffice. Seven times she went to prison, enduring four hunger strikes and\r\ntwo hundred and thirty-two compulsory feedings, biting the hand that\r\nforcibly fed her. Since it was distasteful to the Government to have any\r\nsuffragette die in prison, Kitty, under the so-called Cat-and-Mouse Act,\r\nwas once released to a nursing home until she should have strength\r\nenough to return to confinement. Friends visited her there, exchanged\r\nclothes with her, and she escaped. On another occasion the Bishop of\r\nLondon personally begged her to give up her struggle. At the outbreak of\r\nwar, the Pankhurst forces hustled her over to America rather than have\r\nher run the almost certain risk of deportation or internment.\r\n\r\nSelling _The Suffragette_ on the streets of London had been part of the\r\ninitiation which duchesses and countesses and other noble auxiliaries to\r\nthe Pankhurst cause had had to undergo. Kitty had stood side by side\r\nwith them. Since we had so experienced a veteran ready for service we\r\nbegan to offer the _Review_ on the sidewalks of New York. Our more sober\r\nsupporters objected because they considered it undignified. But men and\r\nwomen from here, there, and everywhere passed through the commercial\r\ncenters of New York, and this was a real means of reaching them.\r\n\r\nAll of us took a hand, but Kitty was the only one who stood the test of\r\nyears. Strong, stoutish, tow-headed, her blue eyes bright and keen in\r\nspite of being well on in her fifties, she became a familiar sight.\r\nMorning, afternoon, and until midnight—workdays, Sundays, and\r\nholidays—through storms of winter and summer, she tried every street\r\ncorner from Macy’s to the Grand Central Terminal. But her favorite stand\r\nwas Seventh Avenue and Forty-second Street, right at Times Square. In\r\nher own words she was enjoying “the most fascinating, the most comic,\r\nthe most tragic, living, breathing movie in the world.”\r\n\r\nMany people still think I must be Kitty Marion. Everywhere they say to\r\nme, “I saw you twenty years ago outside the Metropolitan Opera House.\r\nYou’ve changed so I wouldn’t know you.”\r\n\r\nStreet selling was torture for me, but I sometimes did it for\r\nself-discipline and because only in this way could I have complete\r\nknowledge of what I was asking others to do. In addition, I learned to\r\nrealize what possible irritations Kitty had to encounter.\r\nNotwithstanding the insults of the ignorant, the censure of the bigots,\r\nshe remained good-humored. They said to her, “You ought to be ashamed of\r\nyourself, you ought to be arrested, to be shot, to be in jail, to be\r\nhanged!” or, “It’s disgraceful, disgusting, scandalous, villainous,\r\ncriminal, and unladylike!” When someone asked, “Have you never heard\r\nGod’s word to ‘be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth’?” Kitty\r\nreplied, “They’ve done that already,” and, knowing her Apocrypha as well\r\nas her Bible, retorted in kind, “Does it not say in Ecclesiasticus:\r\n16; 1, ‘Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children’?”\r\n\r\nDuring the War it was astonishing how many men, in and out of uniform,\r\nmistook Birth Control for British Control. “We don’t want no British\r\nControl here!” they exclaimed. Kitty would correct them, “Birth\r\nControl,” and someone would call, “Oh, that’s worse!”\r\n\r\nWho bought the _Review_? This question was invariably asked, and the\r\nanswer was—radicals, the curious, girls about to be married, mothers,\r\nfathers, social workers, ministers, physicians, reformers,\r\nrevolutionaries, foreigners. A psychological analysis of reactions of\r\npassers-by when they saw the words “birth control” would have been\r\ninteresting. I never could credit the power those simple words had of\r\nupsetting so many people. Their own complexes as to what sex meant to\r\nthem appeared to govern them. Many were disappointed at its staidness;\r\nsome were highly indignant, others highly amused, regarding it as a\r\njoke; some bought with the set faces of soldiers going over the top;\r\nsome looked and looked and then strolled on. Others walked by only to\r\nreturn with the money ready, hastily stuff the magazine in their\r\npockets, and move away, trying to seem unconcerned. The majority bought\r\nwith the utmost seriousness in the hope that it might solve their\r\npersonal problems.\r\n\r\n“Jail” was the instant reaction of every new policeman on the beat.\r\nKitty, who knew she needed no license, would contest the point with him\r\nwhile a crowd gathered. But few of her arresters were familiar with the\r\nlaw in the name of which they hauled her off to the station. Time and\r\nagain my night’s slumbers were broken to go and bail her out. J.J. was\r\nalways able to have the case dismissed, but only after it had been\r\nargued and proved in our favor.\r\n\r\nOnce Charles Bamberger, the _agent provocateur_ of the Society for the\r\nSuppression of Vice who had brought about Bill Sanger’s arrest, worked\r\nmuch the same ruse on Kitty. His society was supposedly designed to\r\npromote purity, which was to its members synonymous with good. But in\r\norder to do this they induced people to break the law by appealing to\r\ntheir deepest human sympathies, a form of trickery not to be condoned by\r\nany moral code.\r\n\r\nBamberger, on repeated visits to Kitty at our office, poignantly\r\ndescribed the condition of his unfortunate wife whose health depended\r\nabsolutely on her getting contraceptive information. Anna’s sense, like\r\nFania Mindell’s, was unfailing in recognizing such decoys; I never went\r\nagainst it. But in vain did she warn Kitty, who gave him the\r\ninformation. He had her arrested, and she was not allowed to tell in\r\ncourt the means by which he had obtained his evidence; she had to serve\r\na term. Kitty’s sentence did not have adequate publicity, but so violent\r\nwas the war temper, that, in view of her German birth, even\r\nwell-disposed newspapers practically ignored it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to selling the _Review_ we tried another experiment in\r\nstreet propaganda. During the warm evenings of one summer Kitty, Helen\r\nTodd, and I, often accompanied by George Swazey, a friendly Englishman,\r\nproceeded to the neighborhood of St. Nicholas Avenue above 125th Street,\r\nwhere many white collar families lived. We used to buy a soapbox at the\r\nnearest delicatessen and Helen, who had a lank, swarthy picturesqueness\r\nwhich attracted attention, mounted it; Swazey, standing behind, held\r\naloft an American flag. Though not a soul might be in sight except our\r\nlittle group with its bundles of literature and Kitty with her\r\n_Reviews_, Helen began in her beautiful voice, “Ladies and Gentlemen,”\r\nbowing to the trees, “we welcome you here tonight.” When nobody appeared\r\nshe began again. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” and this time one or two\r\nstrollers usually lingered. Immediately we raised our pasteboard banners\r\nwith “birth control” printed in black letters. She was off in full\r\nswing, and in a few minutes we had our audience.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our various trials people had sent checks and made\r\ndonations to the special Defense Fund account, and we sent anybody who\r\ngave money, no matter how much or how little, a mimeographed report of\r\nall contributors. We had also accepted almost two thousand\r\npaid-in-advance subscriptions, and had therefore incurred an obligation\r\nto continue the _Review_ for twelve months.\r\n\r\nOne May morning when I put my key in the office door and swung it open,\r\nAnna Lifshiz and I stood and gazed at each other. Only the telephone\r\nperched forlornly on top of a packing box relieved the bare and empty\r\nroom—files, furniture, vouchers, checks, and business records were gone.\r\nWe still had to supply the subscribers with nine issues more, yet we had\r\nno equipment and not one cent in the bank account of the _Review_.\r\n\r\nIt was a challenge. We hurried over to Third Avenue and for twenty\r\ndollars refurnished the office. The loss of the contributors’ cards,\r\nhowever, was irreparable. I could never, in spite of my best efforts,\r\nrecover either them or the missing funds.\r\n\r\nThe strain to finance the _Review_ was so great that after June no more\r\nissues came out until December—the printer trusted us as far as he was\r\nable from month to month. Often the bank account was down to the last\r\nhundred dollars, just enough to hold it open. Yet it might be necessary\r\nto mail letters; the call might be urgent. I was hesitant to spend that\r\nlast amount, but I believed faith could bring anything to realization.\r\nInvariably when I operated on that principle and did what I was impelled\r\nto do, money poured in perhaps ten times over. Always we cleaned the\r\nslate at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the periods of getting roots in and waiting for the\r\norganism to grow, of quiescence before the new beginning and quickening.\r\nI kept going, conscious that with every act I was progressing in accord\r\nwith a universal law of evolution—moral evolution but evolution just the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThis belief seemed at times to force locked doors. It enabled me to\r\ndictate hundreds of letters, to interview dozens of people, to debate,\r\nor to lecture, all in twenty-four hours. Day after day I attended parlor\r\nmeetings, night after night open forums, returning home too tired to\r\neat, too excited to sleep. Frequently at seven in the morning the\r\ntelephone started ringing; somebody wanted to catch me before I left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of having a more solid and substantial basis on which to\r\noperate the _Review_, the New York Women’s Publishing Company was\r\nincorporated in May, 1918; shares were sold at ten dollars each. The\r\nwomen who gave both monetary and moral support were the wives of\r\nbusiness men who advised them how to conduct this organization in the\r\nproper fashion. Each month Mary Knoblauch opened her charming apartment\r\nfor the regular meetings any corporation was required to hold.\r\n\r\nThe movement can never be disassociated in my mind from Frances\r\nAckermann, who, at the suggestion of Mabel Spinney of Greenwich House,\r\ncame to us as Treasurer. She was exceptionally able and was soon one of\r\nour bulwarks, remaining with us eleven years. Her family was wrapped up\r\nin orthodoxy—church and Wall Street and the status quo in politics—but\r\nFrances’ interests were much broader, and she was not content to lead\r\nthe usual type of life ordained by her social and financial standing.\r\n\r\nTall, very thin, wearing her clothes with an air, Frances was one of the\r\nfinest persons I have ever known. To her, fair play amounted to a\r\nreligion; she was so highly sensitive that she lay awake at night after\r\nmerely reading of an injustice done to anybody. To hundreds of\r\nconscientious objectors who were incarcerated during the War because of\r\npacifist or strike activities she sent cigarette money, magazines,\r\nstationery—always anonymously—assisting their families and suggesting\r\nplans for their own futures. Her death was not only a blow to us but a\r\nblow to any endeavor that was seeking understanding. Many lifers who\r\ndepended on her for brightening luxuries must now wonder what has become\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Anne Kennedy came to help boost the circulation of the _Review_\r\nand gain further financial aid for it. She was a Californian with wide\r\nclub experience, and had two children. Fair, in her thirties, cheerful,\r\nand a good mixer, she was most maternal-looking with her soft gray hair\r\nand sweet face; you felt you could lay your head on her bosom and tell\r\nher the story of your life.\r\n\r\nThe incorporation had heralded a new trend wherein we could have a\r\nrecognized policy. When the _Review_ had first been started I had had to\r\nbeg authors to write. Free speech was their favorite theme, and their\r\npieces were inferior, but they were the only things I could fall back\r\nupon. I used to ask possible contributors, “Don’t you agree that these\r\npoor mothers should have no more babies?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, but where’s there any article in that?”\r\n\r\nThen I had to suggest ideas, show them how to link these up with larger\r\nsociological aspects, until they began to cast into the arena legal,\r\nmedical, eugenic compositions. The material on free speech continued to\r\ncome in, but we did not need to print it any longer.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, we now secured second-class mailing privileges. Soon\r\nafterwards I happened to be talking to a cousin who worked in the Post\r\nOffice, a very young boy in his early twenties, who kept assailing me\r\nwith questions about the _Review_. I could not understand his\r\nunprecedented interest, and asked, “Why are you so curious?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m the official reader. It’ll save my having to wade through\r\nevery issue if you’ll tell me ahead of time just what your policy’s\r\ngoing to be.”\r\n\r\n“Do you make the decisions?”\r\n\r\n“That’s my job. If any seem objectionable I send them on to Washington.”\r\n\r\nI was horrified to find this adolescent in a position which permitted\r\nhim to pass judgment on such serious matters, but I was able to reassure\r\nhim; the course we had adopted would in no way interfere with retaining\r\nour second-class mailing privileges.\r\n\r\nMany of the buyers of the _Review_ had been disappointed because it\r\ncontained no practical information. “I have your magazine. All in there\r\nis true but what I want to know is how not to have another baby next\r\nyear.” Thousands of letters were sent out explaining that the _Review_\r\ncould not print birth control information. Nevertheless, some of the\r\nappeals, particularly from women who lived on lonely, remote farms, were\r\nso heart-rending that I simply had to furnish them copies of _Family\r\nLimitation_, though urging them to go to their physicians.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while I had a telephone message to come down to the Post\r\nOffice at an appointed hour. I did so, wondering and uncertain. Was the\r\ninterview to be about the _Review_, _Family Limitation_, or what?\r\n\r\nThe official in the legal department whom I always saw, fatherly though\r\nnot old, used to say, “Now, Mrs. Sanger, you’re still violating the law\r\nby sending your pamphlet through the mails. If you keep this up they’ll\r\nput you in jail again.”\r\n\r\nI objected, “The Government and I had this out years ago. The Federal\r\ncase was dismissed.”\r\n\r\n“It never can be settled while we get these protests.”\r\n\r\nTo prove the Post Office was not having such an easy time of it, he\r\npulled open a drawer and inside was a little pile of pamphlets and\r\nletters from religious fanatics, self-constituted moralists of one kind\r\nor another, women as well as men, who had received their copies and then\r\ncomplained. He showed me envelopes addressed to the Governor of New\r\nYork, to the President of the United States. I studied the handwriting\r\nto see whether I could recognize it as identical with any that had come\r\nto me. Perhaps the postmark was Wichita, Kansas; there could not be many\r\nfrom a town of that size, and presently I remembered the request. It was\r\na shattering thing to see that drawer. I had been earnestly trying to\r\naid despairing mothers, and had been betrayed.\r\n\r\n“Here’s this proof against you, Mrs. Sanger. What are you going to do\r\nabout it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. As long as these women ask me to help them, I’m going to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\nI intended to continue to the limit of my resources whether or not I had\r\nhelp from those whom I had originally counted upon. In order to make\r\nwomen’s clubs feel the need as I did I had often gone miles at my own\r\nexpense to present a topic that had taken me years to prepare and then\r\nhad had to express it to the accompaniment of the clatter of dishes or\r\nthe stirring of spoons in after-dinner coffees. The members had seemed\r\nto have their minds on hot rolls or had been fidgeting to get on to the\r\nbridge tables. Sometimes a few, who had come to dabble in\r\nsentimentality, had experienced a pleasant emotional response, “Oh, the\r\npoor things,” but that had been as far as it had gone.\r\n\r\nThe continued apathy of such organizations disappointed me intensely;\r\nthe desire to build up a structure appeared to dominate them all. I had\r\nlost faith in their sincerity, respect for their courage, and at this\r\ntime had no reason to anticipate assistance from them. To upbraid,\r\naccuse, or censure them for not doing what I had hoped was useless, but\r\nI resolved that I was never again going to talk to them, and, when it\r\nseemed necessary that they be addressed, I sent others to do it.\r\n\r\nMy nervousness ahead of lectures continued to be akin to illness. All\r\nthrough the years it has been like a nightmare even to think of a\r\npending speech. I promised enthusiastically to go here or there, and\r\nthen tried to forget it. The morning it was to be delivered I awakened\r\nwith a panicky feeling which grew into a sort of terror if I allowed\r\nmyself to dwell on it. It was fatal to eat before a meeting.\r\n\r\nSome people can keep an audience rocking with laughter and yet get over\r\na message. But I cannot. Seldom do my hearers have anything merry from\r\nme. Advisers often say, “Lighten up your subject.” I have always\r\nresented this; I am the protagonist of women who have nothing to laugh\r\nat.\r\n\r\nHeywood Broun once remarked that I had no sense of humor. I was\r\nsurprised at him, but I could understand his statement in a way; he had\r\nbeen at only a few meetings as chairman and I had been serious to the\r\npoint of deadliness, purposely bringing forth laborious facts and\r\ndramatic statistics. I was grasping at an opportunity to reach his\r\naudience because, whenever he was moved by anything deeply, he wrote a\r\nstory in his column which by reason of its effective irony and smooth\r\nprose swayed others to the same extent.\r\n\r\nI have had much fun, although it may have penetrated only to the\r\nintimate circle of friends. Once after giving what I thought was a very\r\nup-to-date, spirited talk at the Waldorf-Astoria, a dear old lady, at\r\nleast in her middle eighties, tottered towards me with the aid of a cane\r\nand in trembling voice quavered, “I have traveled across the country to\r\nhear you speak, Miss Sangster. My mother used to read your poems to me\r\nwhen I was a little girl, and I feel this is a great day for me to be\r\nable to clasp your hand.” She had confused me with the poetess, Margaret\r\nE. Sangster, who in the mid-Nineteenth Century had been a regular\r\ncontributor to religious magazines.\r\n\r\nInevitably I have been constantly torn between my compulsion to do this\r\nwork and a haunting feeling that I was robbing my children of time to\r\nwhich they were entitled. Back in 1913 I had had some vague notion of\r\nbeing able to spend all my summers with them at Provincetown. That\r\nvisionary hope had been immediately dissipated because too many painters\r\nbegan to discover it and the place became littered with easels and\r\nsmocks. Gene O’Neill’s plays were being produced on the wharf opposite\r\nMary Heaton Vorse’s house, and these brought many more people. I wanted\r\nto get away even further, and so did Jack Reed, who had also sought\r\nsanctuary there. A real estate agent took him to near-by Truro where the\r\nfeet of New Yorkers had not yet trod, and I was invited to come along.\r\nWe saw a little house on a little hill, one of the most ancient in the\r\nvillage. Below it the Pamet River wound like a silver ribbon to the\r\nocean. An old sea captain had squared and smoothed and fitted the\r\ntimbers, brought them up from the Carolinas in a sailing vessel, and\r\nfastened them tightly together with wooden pegs. The kitchen was bright\r\nand warm, and seemed as though many cookies and pies had been baked in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJack bought the cottage, but he was never able to live there. As a staff\r\ncorrespondent of the _Metropolitan Magazine_ he was dashing from the\r\nColorado Fuel and Iron strike to the European War and back again to New\r\nYork. In 1917, knowing I, too, had looked at it with longing eyes, he\r\nasked whether I would like to buy it; he was starting for Russia the\r\nnext day and had to have ready money. By a lucky chance I had just\r\nreceived a check for a thousand dollars in payment for some Chicago\r\nlectures. We exchanged check and deed. He left the next day for the land\r\nof promise whither Bill Haywood, his friend, had already gone and whence\r\nneither was to return.\r\n\r\nBig Bill, who had steadily advocated resistance to conscription, had\r\nbeen arrested and freed on bail furnished by Jessie Ashley. She had\r\nforfeited it gladly to have him safely out of the country. I had had a\r\nlong talk with him before he had made up his mind definitely to leave.\r\nThe conversation brought back to me the picture of the times he and I\r\nhad walked up and down the Cape Cod sands and he had given me such good\r\ncounsel about not jeopardizing the happiness of the children.\r\n\r\nThose who had opposed Bill for his “hands in the pocket” advice at the\r\nPaterson strike were the same who were opposing his jumping his bail.\r\nSince the day we had together visited the C.G.T. meetings in Paris, Bill\r\nhad come to see the virtues of expediency; that, rather than languish in\r\njail where he could accomplish no useful purpose, a revolutionary\r\nshould, if he could, exile himself. “He who fights and runs away, will\r\nlive to fight another day.” This, according to the American idea, was\r\ncowardice—you should stay and be a martyr. But to Bill it was now merely\r\nshortsighted. He had concluded that the average worker when he went in\r\nfor rioting and hand-to-hand combat was beaten before he had begun. He\r\nrealized the workers had been split by the War; they had not united and\r\nstood up against conscription with any backbone. They could not as yet\r\nbe depended upon as a force, but some day he hoped to return and\r\nreorganize them.\r\n\r\nTruro provided the children with three carefree months every summer in\r\nwhat still seems to me one of the most beautiful spots in the world. For\r\nseveral years I hung on to this dream of being with them constantly, but\r\nit was only a dream. I used to go down to open the house and perhaps\r\nsnatch a week or so there before being obliged to hurry back, but father\r\nand my sister Nan were good foster-parents. This house was eventually to\r\nburn as had the one in Hastings; fate seemed to decree I should not be\r\ntempted to slip back into peaceful domesticity.\r\n\r\nNor did I have all those hoped for years of watching the boys grow from\r\none stage to another. I had had to analyze the situation—either to keep\r\nthem at home under the supervision of servants who might perhaps be\r\nincompetent, and to have no more than the pleasure of seeing them safely\r\nto bed, or else to sacrifice my maternal feelings and put them in\r\ncountry schools directed by capable masters where they could lead a\r\nhealthy, regular life. Having come to this latter decision I sent them\r\noff fairly young, and thereafter could only visit them over week-ends or\r\non the rare occasions when I was speaking in the vicinity. If the desire\r\nto see them grew beyond control, I took the first train and received the\r\nshock of finding them thoroughly contented in the companionship they had\r\nmade for themselves; after the initial excitement of greeting had passed\r\naway they ran off again to their games.\r\n\r\nAt times the homesickness for them seemed too much to bear; especially\r\nwas this true in the Fourteenth Street studio. When I came in late at\r\nnight the fire was dead in the grate, the book open on the table, the\r\nglove dropped on the floor, the pillow rumpled on the sofa—all the\r\nsame—just as I had left them a day, a week, or a month before. That\r\nfirst chill of loneliness was always appalling. I wanted, as a child\r\ndoes, to be like other people; I wanted to be able to sink gratefully\r\ninto the warmth and glow of a loving family welcome.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1917–18 was particularly hard; the snow drifted high and\r\nlasted long, and it took forced cheer to keep your spirits up. Dr. Mary\r\nHalton assured me that with ceaseless financial worry, inadequate rest,\r\nincessant traveling, improper nourishment, I could not survive long.\r\nWhen, therefore, a publisher asked me for a book on labor problems, I\r\nsnatched ten-year-old Grant out of school and set off for California,\r\ntaking a small place at Coronado where I sat myself down for three\r\nmonths to write and to get acquainted with my son.\r\n\r\nI loved the sunshine. It was a pleasure to be out-of-doors, to have\r\npeace and quiet and the leisure to arrange my thoughts and put them on\r\npaper. I had no inclination towards a labor book, but thoroughly enjoyed\r\nletting loose my pent-up feelings on _Woman and the New Race_. It was\r\ngood to classify reasons and set them in order. My opinions did emerge,\r\nand it was a great release.\r\n\r\nI was vividly reminded of prison one day when Grant came home from the\r\nschool he was attending, both his eyes pretty dirty-looking. I asked him\r\nwhy he had been fighting.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this boy told all the fellows my mother’d been in jail.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?”\r\n\r\n“I hit him, and he hit me back. He said, ‘Your mother’s a jailbird,’ and\r\nI said, ‘She’s not.’ Then another fellow said, ‘My mother says your\r\nmother went to jail too.’”\r\n\r\nGrant had replied, “That wasn’t my mother, that was another Margaret\r\nSanger.”\r\n\r\n“How could you say that, Grant? You know it wasn’t true.”\r\n\r\n“Mother,” he replied profoundly, “you could never make those fellows\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Twenty-one_\r\n\r\n                            THUS TO REVISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe event of my visit to London in 1920 was the beginning of my\r\nfriendship with H. G. Wells. There was no aloofness or coldness in\r\napproaching him, no barriers to break down as with most Englishmen; his\r\ntwinkling eyes were like those of a mischievous boy. I was pleased to\r\nfind he had no beard and no white hair, because it seemed to me I had\r\nheard of him since I had begun to think at all.\r\n\r\nWells had ranged every field of knowledge, had dared to invade the\r\nsacrosanct precincts of the historian, the economist, and the scientist\r\nand, though a layman in these fields, had used his extraordinary gifts\r\nto interpret the past and present and even prophesy the future; in novel\r\nafter novel he had shocked England by championing women’s right to a\r\nfreer life.\r\n\r\nWe in the United States were just beginning to be affected by\r\nsociological concepts; only Henry George and Edward Bellamy had\r\npreviously opened up this new world of the imagination. Now here was\r\nWells giving a fresh picture of what could be if man had an ideal system\r\nof society that was workable. At Columbia Colony he had been quoted\r\nrepeatedly. On my lecture tour in 1916 his name had been on everybody’s\r\nlips, and he had signed the letter to President Wilson protesting\r\nagainst the Federal indictment. I believed he had influenced the\r\nAmerican intelligentsia more than any other one man.\r\n\r\nFor good reason countless faithful friends had attached themselves to\r\nWells, and he included in his varied, intricate, and unpredictable\r\npersonality a capacity for loyally loving both individuals and humanity.\r\n\r\nPeople who had never met Wells always thought they knew him best,\r\nespecially Londoners. I was stopping with three maiden sisters in\r\nHampstead Gardens, and a great furor arose as soon as it was known in\r\nthe household that Mrs. Wells had sent me an invitation for what was to\r\nbe my first week-end at Easton Glebe in Essex. What was I to wear? Was I\r\ngoing to take the blue net or the flowered chiffon? They were greatly\r\ndisappointed when I carried only a small bag in which there was no room\r\nfor fluffy evening gowns.\r\n\r\nWells himself was waiting on the platform at Dunmow Station, and we\r\ndrove in his little car, called the Pumpkin, to Easton Glebe, a part of\r\nthe Warwick Estate on which he held a life lease. The former rectory was\r\nbuilt of old stone, ivy-covered; lovely lawns were spread around it.\r\nEarly morning tea was served in your room, shoes put out at night were\r\nproperly polished, hot water was plentiful for your bath, and extra\r\npitchers were brought with towels wrapped around carefully to keep in\r\nthe steam.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the next two days I realized more than ever before\r\nhow sensitive H.G. was to the slightest intonation. To be with him meant\r\nyou had to be on the alert every second lest you miss something of him.\r\nHe could be amusing, witty, sarcastic, brilliant, flirtatious, and yet\r\nprofound at once, all in his thin, small voice, speaking high up into\r\nthe roof of his mouth, as do many English, instead of back in the throat\r\nas we do.\r\n\r\nI returned Monday evening about midnight to my room at Hampstead, having\r\nspent the day in town seeing people. But no sooner had I closed the door\r\nthan steps pattered in the hallway and a soft hand tapped. In came the\r\nthree ladies, hair in braids, warmly and most modestly swathed in\r\nvoluminous, white cotton nighties, long-sleeved and tight around the\r\nneck. They had stayed wide-awake to hear all about my week-end. I told\r\nthem as much as I could remember of the place and the stimulating fellow\r\nguests, one in particular with whom I had been having an interesting\r\ndiscussion. When I had finished the eldest leaned forward and\r\nhesitatingly but loudly whispered, “Did he try to kiss you?”\r\n\r\n“What? Who?” I asked, having in mind the man I had just been praising.\r\n\r\n“Why—why—don’t you know?”\r\n\r\n“Know what?”\r\n\r\nShe looked a little abashed at this, and another voice explained\r\napologetically, “Sister means that Wells has a magnetic influence over\r\nwomen!”\r\n\r\n“Was he fascinating?” the youngest eagerly took up the catechism.\r\n\r\nFor two solid hours I was bombarded with questions; H.G. was the Don\r\nJuan of spinsterhood in England. That there was a Mrs. Wells for whom\r\nMr. Wells cared deeply did not matter in the least to them.\r\n\r\nI wish I could do justice to Jane, as Catherine Wells was affectionately\r\ncalled. This devoted mother, perfect companion, was the complete\r\nhelpmate, managing H.G.’s finances, reading the proofs of his books,\r\nseeing that all editions were up-to-date, letting no publisher be\r\ndelinquent in his royalties. She did not pretend to be a Feminist; she\r\nwas there to protect him, performing the duties of an English wife\r\ntowards her husband and appearing with him so that they might make a\r\nunited front to the world. The relationship between them was on a fine\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nAlthough H.G. had told me once “the sun would set if anything ever\r\nhappened to Jane” I felt that he had never put her adequately into his\r\nbooks as the great woman she really was; he was too close to her. After\r\nshe died, his touching introduction to _The Book of Catherine Wells_\r\nproved that he realized what she had been in his life.\r\n\r\nJane was always mothering people and looking after their comfort. At a\r\nlater time when I happened to be at Easton Glebe, she was distressed and\r\nanxious that I was taking it for granted I had to have an ice-pack on my\r\nneck every night because my tubercular glands were bothering me. She\r\ninsisted and insisted something must be done, until finally my tonsils\r\nwere removed, the true source of my trouble. I owed this tremendous\r\nrelief to Jane’s interest, which would not let me go on being sick.\r\n\r\nThe gay wit and gift for mimicry were not confined to H.G. alone. On one\r\nof my visits I was shown a new bathroom, and we viewed solemnly the\r\ntiny, almost microscopic, tub. Jane was slight and small, and I was\r\nquite sure it was meant for her and not for H.G.’s rotund frame. She\r\nmaintained, however, it had been installed for his convenience, and made\r\nfunny suction noises as though a large and deep well were being pumped\r\ndry. I was hilarious, but he, pretending to be irritated, yet laughing\r\ntoo, growled at her, “What are you trying to do? Make my bathing an\r\ninternational joke?”\r\n\r\nThe little things H.G. said, many of them jibes at himself, were always\r\namusing. Even more so were the drawings with which he decorated his\r\nletters. If he did not want to go somewhere he might perhaps illustrate\r\nhis reluctance by picturing himself being dragged off, or, if he desired\r\nthe absence rather than the presence of a person at a meeting, he would\r\nportray him being pushed out unceremoniously. These ingenious\r\ncaricatures allowed many subtleties which even he would not like to put\r\ninto words over his own signature.\r\n\r\nJane was unsurpassed when it came to charades, and never minded having\r\nthe house turned upside down in the search for properties. But the Wells\r\nfamily did not have to depend upon orthodox pastimes; they often made up\r\ntheir own. H.G. had invented a ball game which was played Sunday\r\nmornings in a barn made over into a sort of indoor court. Unlike tennis,\r\nmany could take part at once and the sport was so exhausting that when\r\nthey finished they were usually dripping with perspiration. I did not\r\nplay; other novices seemed to be doing badly enough without me. If you\r\ndid not feel up to anything so strenuous, you could take a short walk\r\nthrough the charming garden which Jane had so lovingly arranged, or a\r\nlong one through the woods, by the lakes, or bordering the streams of\r\nthe Warwick Estate, of which H.G. had free use. Every season had its\r\ndifferent aspects of beauty.\r\n\r\nSunday afternoons and evenings were especially merry. The atmosphere at\r\nEaston Glebe was like nothing else, something that does not exist here,\r\nwhere the elders have their bridge and their conversation and the young\r\ngo dancing or to the movies. There, all ages mixed together in fun, in\r\nlaughter. The two sons, Frank and “Gyp,” who were then at Cambridge,\r\nmight bring from ten to fifteen friends home for tea, a great function\r\nover which Jane so graciously presided. The maids went out after setting\r\nthe table for supper and preparing cold meats on the buffet, and the\r\nparty then took care of itself, everybody serving everybody else. The\r\nboys were full of devilment and it was most uproarious.\r\n\r\nI often wondered how the unexpected arrivals were provided for, but Jane\r\nwas a remarkable hostess; I have known her to have a houseful at Easton\r\nGlebe for lunch and give a brilliant dinner in London that same evening.\r\nEvery guest was planned for, no one was ever huddled with another,\r\nappropriate games were produced or friends invited who might be\r\ninteresting or helpful. When they were ready to leave, all were put on\r\nthe most convenient trains and returned to town with as little trouble\r\nto themselves as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom 1920 on I never went to England without spending part of the time\r\nwith H.G., and many of the most attractive people I met were at Easton\r\nGlebe. I always came away enriched by these contacts and the talks we\r\nhad together. Conversation was a combination of current topics, science,\r\nphilosophy, history. The English might not have had the same light\r\nflippancy or such a scattered fund of information as the average\r\nAmerican, who usually qualified his statements with, “I read that—” or\r\n“I know someone who—,” but they did speak out of their own experience.\r\nFurthermore, they could toss the ball of repartee back and forth\r\nobjectively and not become irritated or let creep into their voices that\r\npersonal note which implied they had now settled the whole thing.\r\n\r\nEach one at Easton Glebe had his turn in the spotlight; it was never a\r\nmonologue, which a man in H.G.’s position might have made it. No subject\r\ncould be mentioned that he did not have its complete history and a\r\ndefinite opinion on it as well, including Neo-Malthusianism in all its\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\nThese week-ends were inspiration and recreation. The serious duty which\r\ncalled me to England was lecturing. The Neo-Malthusian League had few\r\nspeakers at that time to address women audiences, and wished me to test\r\nout the response to their propaganda.\r\n\r\nEnglish public sentiment on birth control had vastly changed since I had\r\nbeen there in 1915, largely because Marie Stopes’ book had had such wide\r\ncirculation during the after-War period; her voice had made articulate\r\nthe feelings of the millions of unemployed. That people now knew what\r\nbirth control meant was due in part also to Harold Cox, one of the\r\nfinest orators of his generation, who had been the first to point out\r\nthat its condemnation by medical men and Anglican clergy should carry\r\nlittle weight, because the birth rates among them were lower than those\r\nof almost any other classes. Notable exceptions who had come out\r\nfavorably were Sir James Barr, ex-President of the British Medical\r\nAssociation, Dr. C. Killick Millard, Health Officer of Leicester in the\r\nNorth, Dean Inge of St. Paul’s, and the Bishop of Birmingham, who was\r\nChairman of the English National Birth Rate Commission; England was\r\naccustomed to clarifying new and controversial subjects by such bodies,\r\nsummoning experts to testify.\r\n\r\nDr. Alice Vickery arranged for me to give a series of talks, many before\r\nlower middle-class workers’ wives who belonged to the Women’s\r\nCo-operative Guild. In different districts of London they came together,\r\npaying their little bit, perhaps sixpence a month, to listen to\r\nspeakers, afterwards serving tea and conversing in a friendly way among\r\nthemselves. Though their economic uncertainty made them resigned to\r\nhaving ten or twelve children, the fact that the Guild had just brought\r\nout a book describing some of the tragic cases of its own members and\r\nthe deaths from over-childbearing helped to pave the way.\r\n\r\nOf all the slums I visited in trams, on buses, via the Underground, the\r\none of worst repute at the time was the dockyards section of\r\nRotherhithe. I held a small demonstration clinic there—in a sense the\r\nfirst of its kind in England. The eager women who came, amazingly\r\nignorant of any possible beauty in marriage, were envious of a few in\r\nthe community who, though the fathers were receiving no higher wages\r\nthan their own husbands, had had only two or three children and\r\nconsequently could afford to send them to the trade school. They\r\nthemselves were, if not sliding backward, at least no more than holding\r\ntheir own, but those few families were definitely on the way up in the\r\nsocial scale. And it had all come to pass because Dr. Vickery and Anne\r\nMartin, a friend of hers who had labored there for two decades as a\r\nsocial worker, had given some contraceptive information about ten years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Vickery had on numerous occasions raised the question of\r\nbirth control before gatherings bent on other matters, it fell to my lot\r\nto discuss it first as a public health issue. I was told I might have\r\nthree minutes to address a national health Conference on Maternal and\r\nInfant Welfare to be held at Brighton. Considering the four hours\r\nrequired in transit this might seem a short time, but I was happy to\r\nhave even as much as that. So I went.\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of reaching university students I traveled to\r\nCambridge. In the midst of the weathered spires, the ivied halls, and\r\nthe storied dignity of Trinity and Kings, Noel Porter and his wife,\r\nBevan, had converted an old public house, The Half Moon, into a home,\r\nyet had managed to keep its original atmosphere of convivial\r\nhospitality. The tap-room had once opened directly on Little St. Mary’s\r\nLane; now the bar had been removed, but the ancient sign still swung\r\nback and forth and the smoky ceilings and mildewed paneling were the\r\nsame as when former generations had congregated there over mugs of ale.\r\n\r\nOpposite was a tiny, old-fashioned graveyard, no longer used, and I went\r\nout there and let the sun beat against my aching back. It was amusing to\r\nhave to resort to a cemetery for privacy, but the house was constantly\r\nfilled with hatless students coming and going through the enormous\r\ndownstairs room which served as rendezvous for all. In the afternoons\r\nthese youths on the threshold of manhood came to talk over the questions\r\nwhich were perplexing them; in the evenings they had little meetings, at\r\none of which I spoke.\r\n\r\nGuy Aldred, who was in Scotland, had planned my schedule there, and I\r\nhad three weeks of a Scottish summer—bluebells so thick in spots that\r\nthe ground was azure, long twilights when the lavender heather faded the\r\nhills into purple.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in Glasgow before, I had encountered only officials, but\r\non this occasion I met the people in their homes and found them quite\r\nopposite to the stingy, tight-fisted, middle-class stereotype. They were\r\nhospitable, generous, mentally alert, just as witty as the Irish and in\r\nmuch the same way, which rather surprised me.\r\n\r\nFourth of July, Sunday, we had a noon meeting on the Glasgow Green.\r\nNearly two thousand shipyard workers in caps and baggy corduroys stood\r\nclose together listening in utter, dead stillness without cough or\r\nwhisper. That evening I spoke in a hall under Socialist auspices, Guy\r\nAldred acting as chairman. One old-timer said he had been a party member\r\nfor eleven years, attending Sunday night lectures regularly, but never\r\nbefore had he been able to induce his wife to come; tonight he could not\r\nkeep her home. “Look!” he cried in amazement. “The women have crowded\r\nthe men out of this hall. I never saw so many wives of comrades before.”\r\n\r\nThe men were there, partly through curiosity to hear the American and\r\npartly through interest in the subject, ready to fight the ancient\r\nbattle of Marx against Malthus. Efforts of the English Neo-Malthusians\r\nto introduce birth control to the masses had been hampered not only by\r\nthe opposition of the upper classes, but more especially by the\r\npersistent hostility of the orthodox Socialists.\r\n\r\nMarx, dealing with problems after they had arisen, had taught that any\r\nreform likely to dull the edge of poverty was bad for Socialism because\r\nit made labor less dissatisfied. It followed that if a man had to fight\r\nfor the hungers and necessities of ten or twelve children, he made a\r\nbetter revolutionary. “Let ’em have as many as they can,” was the cry.\r\nOn the other hand, if birth control were practiced by the working\r\nclasses, the wage earner who could support two children and knew how not\r\nto have more was going to be content and would not struggle against\r\nconditions of economic insecurity. Hence he was likely to forget “the\r\nRevolution.”\r\n\r\nKnowing that the Scotch took mental notes of items on which to debate, I\r\nhad tried to prepare myself well, and I produced the unanswerable\r\nargument to this theory. “Why do you demand higher wages then,” I asked,\r\n“when what you really want is privation? If misery is your weapon you\r\nshould not insist on an eight-hour day but on a twelve- or fourteen-hour\r\none. You should pile up your grievances, and pile them up higher.\r\nHowever, in spite of your best efforts I believe your hunger-revolution\r\nwill, as it has always done, capitulate to whatever force or government\r\nwill fill your stomachs.”\r\n\r\nSocialists, like anarchists and syndicalists, were used to contesting\r\nMalthusianism on economic grounds, but, unlike the others, they had as a\r\npart of their platform the freedom of woman. I pointed out that she\r\ncould have the sort of freedom they desired for her right here and now\r\nthrough birth control.\r\n\r\nWhen I ended, Guy Aldred asked, “Now are there any questions?” After a\r\nfew somewhat irrelevant ones, silence fell; confronted by their own\r\nphilosophy they could see it. One man finally rose, “We’d like to hear\r\nwhat the Chairman thinks of all this. Does he believe birth control will\r\ndo what the lady speaker claims for it?” Apparently they were waiting\r\nfor their cue. But Guy Aldred was not to be drawn. After giving him an\r\nopportunity to express himself they plunged in and said their say. Even\r\nsome women who had never been on their feet before got up to tell\r\ndramatic, vivid, personal stories.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was on my way to a town not far from Dunfermline, Andrew\r\nCarnegie’s birthplace. I arrived about four o’clock in a driving storm,\r\nlacking both umbrella and raincoat. No taxi had ever graced the railroad\r\nstation, and we trudged through the rain to the cottage of one of the\r\n“most advanced friends of labor.” I was soaking wet up to the knees. A\r\nhurry-call was sent to neighbors for dry clothing, but among that\r\npopulation of five thousand not a single woman had an extra skirt to\r\nlend, and only after long search was a new pair of Sunday shoes\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nBecause there was not an inn within miles, I slept that night with my\r\nhostess in the one bed the house contained; the husband stretched\r\nhimself out on two chairs in the kitchen. Since Sylvia Pankhurst had\r\nbeen similarly accommodated just a few months before, I knew I was\r\nhaving the best the village afforded.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants had been dispatched from Lancashire factory towns during\r\nthe War for special munitions work, and here they had stayed and made\r\ntheir homes. Practically all had been apprenticed to the mills at the\r\nage of eight or nine. Girls, because they were destined for marriage and\r\ntherefore needed no education, had worked ten or twelve hours a day\r\nthroughout their adolescence, and even after their weddings up to the\r\ntime pregnancy was well advanced. As a result, the young mothers, who\r\nhad never, from childhood to maturity, had a chance to become rested and\r\nget the fatigue out of their systems, had apparently transmitted their\r\nweariness to their children; the firstborn were sleepy, inert, and\r\nalways tired. A doctor told me it was common for boys and girls of five,\r\nsix, and seven to fall asleep at their school desks and have to be\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\nWhen I had arrived in England I had gone to see Havelock in the quaint\r\nold Cornwall village where he was living alone since Edith’s death.\r\nWinding pathways, well-trodden and embraced on either side by rambling\r\nshrubbery and verbena, led from his house to the sea hundreds of feet\r\nbelow. The waves dashed continuously against the crags and rocks, and\r\nthousands of gulls shrieked or sailed majestically almost in front of my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWe had then talked about going to Ireland where I could make a foray\r\ninto my own genealogy. Mother’s ancestors at some stage had been the\r\nsame as Edward Fitzgerald’s and I thought I might find some of the\r\nplaces from which they had sprung. I had no exact information—just\r\ntradition from childhood days. Now, after my strenuous lecturing, I\r\nneeded a brief holiday, and Havelock also wanted a vacation; so we\r\njoined forces.\r\n\r\nMy primary purpose was frustrated because after half a century nobody in\r\nany of the little villages seemed to know anything definite. At\r\nGlengariff they said, “Sure, and I thought it was Killarney your\r\ngrandfather was born in.” But at Killarney I was told, “Oh, it was Cork\r\nyour family came from. My grandmother knew them very well.”\r\n\r\nMore difficult to surmount than the vague discursiveness of these good\r\npeople was the Sinn Fein Rebellion, in the thick of which we found\r\nourselves. The night before we reached Cork there had been a raid and\r\nthe leaders were in hiding. Everywhere we went we could sense a subtle,\r\nsurreptitious undercurrent—in the hotels, in the restaurants, among\r\nsmall, whispering groups which dispersed when any stranger approached.\r\n\r\nIreland had great natural beauty, and I was sorry to see the beginnings\r\nof ugly, modern industrialism cropping up, especially in Cork with the\r\nFord factory. The mustard-colored kilts of the men astonished me; I had\r\nnever known the Irish wore them, but they were trying to bring back\r\ntheir ancestral dress along with the Gaelic language. Always their\r\nkindness and interest and the sadness in their voices moved me deeply.\r\nThey were never too sad, however, to give a quick turn to a phrase. One\r\nmorning the tram in which we were riding suddenly stopped. Nobody knew\r\nwhy; everybody was complaining. Then from a side street came a handful\r\nof Black and Tans with bayonets fixed. I asked the Irishman sitting\r\nbeside me, “What does that mean?”\r\n\r\n“You should know,” he replied. “Those are Wilson’s Fourteen Pints.”\r\n\r\nHavelock was a delightful companion, not loquacious, but keenly\r\ninterested in everything, and forever jotting down his copious notes. We\r\nhired a two-wheeled jaunting car in which we sat back to back, and in\r\nthis way bumped from Glengariff to Killarney. Occasionally the sun broke\r\nthrough for half an hour, but it was wet that year—potatoes and hay were\r\nrotting on the ground because the sun did not shine long enough to dry\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the inn, drenched and sopping. Havelock, with his\r\ntypically English dread of a cold, went to bed, but I stayed up talking\r\nwith a young woman and three equally young traveling priests—Sinn\r\nFeiners all. We chatted desultorily until I happened to mention I had a\r\nletter to the widow of the hero, Skeffington, who had been killed in the\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nThe company, assuming me to be one with their cause, immediately became\r\nmost friendly. The girl began discussing higher education for her sex. I\r\nasked her how she could keep on when she married and had the inevitable\r\nsuccession of offspring. The priests, somewhat to my surprise, fell in\r\nwith my ideas by deploring too large families; some of the older sons\r\nand daughters had to emigrate, and even those who were left could not\r\ncare adequately for their parents. It would be better for the Catholic\r\nChurch as well as for the world if they could help people to have only a\r\nfew children and bring them up decently. I felt hopeful because they\r\nwere speaking of birth control as solving some of their own problems;\r\nthey were saying exactly what I most wanted them to say.\r\n\r\nSeveral happy days we spent at Killarney, exploring on foot, on\r\nhorseback, and in boats. The men who drove the cart or rowed us through\r\nthe lakes always knew the old myths of the mountains and poured into our\r\nears tales of leprechauns and other “little people.” You heard the word\r\n“divil” more than any other. Here the divil, so they told us, had left\r\nhis step, there he had run away. The shape of every mountain, the twist\r\nof every stream had their stories.\r\n\r\nWherever we went women, lean and elderly, wearing tiny shoulder shawls\r\nand calico print dresses, fairly started out of the hillsides,\r\nbareheaded, barefooted, complexions like roses, and eyes as blue as the\r\nsky. Yet their faces were hungry and worn. Getting on in years as they\r\nwere, they could and did run faster than our ponies. When we spurred\r\nforward they came right along, flattering, cajoling, uttering prayers\r\nand “God bless you’s,” calling on all the saints to preserve you if you\r\nwould buy a drop of “Mountain Dew,” which was so good for your health.\r\nIf you bought this Irish whiskey from one, another took her place, and,\r\nquite undiscouraged, began again the flow of sales talk.\r\n\r\nOne of our last days, when the wraiths of the lake dimmed the emerald\r\nhills, we walked to red-bricked Killarney House, to which, as Havelock\r\nsaid, nature was adding her own wild beauty to the beauty that man had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAll of Ireland had seemed draped in mist and sadness and, lovely as it\r\nhad been, I never wanted to go back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Twenty-two_\r\n\r\n                    DO YE HEAR THE CHILDREN WEEPING?\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Irish interlude I was ready to go on to Germany to carry out\r\nthe most important objective of my journey abroad. It had become obvious\r\nthat progress depended on finding a means of contraception, cheap,\r\nharmless, easily applied. Way back in 1914 Havelock had seen in some of\r\nthe last medical journals to come out of Germany an advertisement of a\r\nchemical contraceptive. He had mentioned it to me, and ever since I had\r\nbeen eager to track it down. In pre-War Germany every advertised product\r\nhad been required to live up to the claims made for it; the public must\r\nnot be misled. Thus I was convinced that if the notice had stated it was\r\nto prevent conception, the assertion was true. No news of it had come\r\nsince the War, and I wished to ascertain whether it was still being\r\nmanufactured. Perhaps this formula would be the solution to our problem.\r\n\r\nI had a secondary reason also for going to Germany—to investigate the\r\ndecline in the birth rate. It was said half the married women had become\r\nbarren during the blockade for lack of proper food. I was always looking\r\nfor evidence to support and strengthen our arguments, and, consequently,\r\nwanted to discover what had been learned of the relation between\r\nvitamins and fertility.\r\n\r\nBerlin was cold and dark when Rose Witcop and I, about eleven at night,\r\narrived at Neuköln, a special proletarian section of the city. The train\r\nwas late, an unusual state of things in efficient Germany, but this was\r\nthe period of her greatest disorganization. The telegram which had been\r\nsent to Rose’s sister and brother-in-law, Milly and Rudolph Rocker, had\r\napparently not been delivered; nobody met us. There were no taxis, no\r\ncarriages, no lamps, no lights in the windows to relieve the pitch\r\nblackness. A sleepy, disgruntled porter led us across the street to an\r\ninsignificant hotel. He knocked at the door; a head popped out of a\r\nwindow above. “Two ladies want to stay overnight.” The proprietress said\r\nshe could give us nothing to eat, but that we could have a room. We\r\naccepted gladly, climbed up a ladder into the same bed, piled high with\r\nfeathered mattresses above and below us, and settled ourselves to\r\ncomforting sleep after the long and tiresome journey.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, refreshed, we took a tram to the Rockers’ small\r\napartment. Rudolph was a syndicalist, a friend of Portet, and had been\r\ninterned in a concentration camp near London during the War. Both Milly\r\nand Rudolph had suffered great privations after their return. But,\r\nalthough food was very scarce, they were more than prodigal and kind in\r\nsharing with us.\r\n\r\nGermany was still no place for casual visitors in 1920. She seemed dead,\r\ncrushed, broken. Street traffic, even in a metropolis the size of\r\nBerlin, was slight. I noted particularly the grim silence everywhere;\r\npeople had forgotten how to smile. They were thankful for the\r\nRevolution, but it had not brought much relief, and the winter to come\r\nwas dreaded. Instead of displaying food or clothing, the windows of shop\r\nafter shop on street after street were decorated only with streamers of\r\ncolored paper.\r\n\r\nEverybody was ravenous for fresh vegetables; money meant nothing, food\r\neverything. I saw old peasant women coming in from the country with bags\r\nof potatoes on their backs. Fifteen minutes after emptying them on to\r\npushcarts they were sold out. The only fruit to be had were plums, and\r\nthat is how I remember it was late summer in Berlin; it is curious how\r\nsuch memories crop up.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily I could go without eating if I had plenty of water, but in\r\nBerlin I found myself haunting grocery stores like a hungry animal,\r\nexamining each new article avariciously. I cannot as a rule bear tinned\r\nmilk and will not give it to babies, yet here when I saw a can of\r\nAmerican evaporated milk, I found myself viewing it with glowing eyes. I\r\nwas disgusted with myself. Nothing satisfied my appetite except eggs,\r\nand these, along with milk, could be purchased only on prescription from\r\na doctor. Meat was reduced to half a pound a week for each person, but I\r\nhad no ration card. A neighbor of the Rockers obtained some bread for me\r\nand gave me her potatoes although she and her three lovely daughters had\r\nonly rice as a substitute. I was in tears over her generosity.\r\n\r\nFor months many families had existed on nothing but turnips. They ate\r\nturnip soup, turnips raw, turnips mashed, turnip salad, turnip coffee,\r\nuntil their whole systems revolted physically against the sight of\r\nturnips. The contact with other persons in trams, halls, churches, even\r\nstreets, was nauseating; in a few minutes the fumes of turnip from their\r\nbodies was so offensive that they became almost unendurable to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI went into a two-room home, clean but overflowing with ten children,\r\nfive born since the War, starvation horribly stamped on their faces. The\r\noldest was twelve—still too young to work. The father, a locksmith, had\r\nno job. All were living on a hundred marks received every week from\r\nGovernment Unemployment Insurance. It was now Saturday, and not one\r\ncrumb or morsel remained to tide them over until the next payment on\r\nMonday. They had eaten no breakfast, no dinner, and the father had gone\r\nto the woods to search for mushrooms to keep them alive.\r\n\r\nEven men who had employment were working only three days a week,\r\naveraging a hundred and fifty marks for a family, and marks were fifty\r\nto the American dollar. The best food had to be given to them because\r\nthey were the earners. Women were the real sufferers; they had to go\r\nwithout or subsist on what they could scrape together. They nursed their\r\nbabies beyond two years to supply milk, and all their time was occupied\r\nin a constant hunt to find nourishment for the older ones.\r\n\r\nI heard countless stories from mothers who had been tortured by watching\r\ntheir children slowly starve to death—pinched faces growing paler, eyes\r\nmore listless, heads drooping lower day by day until finally they did\r\nnot even ask for food. You saw a tiny thing playing on the street\r\nsuddenly run to a tree or fence and lean against it while he coughed and\r\nhad a hemorrhage. Others like him were dying of tuberculosis from lack\r\nof eggs, butter, and milk—so many cows had been sent to France. Yet they\r\ncame up to me and offered to sell their prescriptions thinking that I,\r\nas a foreigner, had money to buy them; they themselves had none for\r\nthese luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned warrior who entered with the sword and killed his\r\nvictims outright had my respect after witnessing the “peace conditions”\r\nof Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Quaker food stations admitted only children who were ill and only\r\nmothers who were more than seven months pregnant or who were nursing\r\nbabies less than four months old. The spectacle of one of these women\r\nbringing two or three of her brood, not sick enough to be regularly fed,\r\nto share her own soup was too sad and overwhelming to bear. Those in\r\ncharge of the distribution wanted each mother herself to eat for the\r\nbenefit of her unborn child or nursing infant, and were already crowded\r\nto capacity, feeding three and four hundred at a time on cocoa and rolls\r\nmade from white flour. But they could not bring themselves to exclude\r\nthe little scarecrows with large, starry eyes, pipestem legs, and hands\r\nfrom which the flesh had fallen until they were like claws. On one of my\r\nvisits the “sister” had them stand up and then asked, “Where have you\r\nbeen?”\r\n\r\n“To America,” they chorused.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say?”\r\n\r\n“We love America. We thank America.”\r\n\r\nI did not instantly comprehend, but it was explained to me that they\r\ncalled the station _Amerika_ in token of their gratitude.\r\n\r\nTo account for the sorry state in which they found themselves the\r\nGermans were groping to fix the blame either within their country or on\r\nsome foreign power. All seemed of the opinion that had the United States\r\nnot entered the War, none would have been victor and none vanquished;\r\nthis, they said, would have meant a lasting peace. Yet they felt little\r\nanimosity towards us. What there was had been largely wiped out by the\r\naid of the Hoover Commission. Furthermore, they still hoped we might be\r\nan influence in loosening the Treaty chains which kept them helpless and\r\nbound. When I asked them why they had accepted the humiliating terms at\r\nVersailles of which they complained so bitterly, they replied they had\r\nbeen told that, had they not done so, vast territories which supposedly\r\nhad been mined would have been blown up and huge populations would have\r\nbeen annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe military party accused the Socialists of having stabbed them in the\r\nback and brought about defeat through the leadership of such pacifists\r\nas Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who had paid with their lives;\r\nthe Socialists and workers regretted they had not united with Russia\r\nand, combining their own scientific and technical knowledge with her raw\r\nmaterials, conquered the world and thus molded all civilization to their\r\nideals.\r\n\r\nBoth classes sincerely believed that France wanted to destroy them\r\nutterly. I saw something of the reason for their feeling one day when a\r\ntram stopped to let off passengers, and a French automobile filled with\r\nFrench officers, instead of halting the prescribed number of feet away,\r\nplowed right through, knocking down two people and never even pausing to\r\nsee what havoc it had created. The spectators gazed at the bodies lying\r\nthere waiting for the ambulance. They did not dare shake their fists,\r\nbut anyone could tell from the pitch of their voices, their expressions\r\nof passion and anger, how bitter was their resentment.\r\n\r\nThe women broke down all the reserves of my emotion. They had been at\r\none time the most advanced in Europe, politically, economically, and\r\nsocially, and, although they had had to work harder at the gymnasiums\r\nthan the men because higher marks had been required of them, they had\r\nbeen really on a par. But now a frightful retrogression had occurred.\r\nWorking women had been forced down to a state beside the lower animals;\r\nthey had become drudges in the fields in place of draft horses. I saw\r\none who could not have been past twenty-five carrying a huge basket of\r\nvegetables strapped to her back, the weight of which threw her forward\r\nso that I expected any minute to see her go on all fours.\r\n\r\nAn impressive and tragic poster by Käthe Kollwitz was displayed on\r\nvarious corners. It showed a woman with head thrown back, eyes closed,\r\narms crossed over breast, and was captioned simply, “Waiting.” The human\r\nfigures you saw on the streets looked out of eyes dried by suffering and\r\ndeepened by hunger. They had no faith, no hope, no philosophy; they were\r\nresigned to love or hatred, peace or war, a living death or a sudden\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe, governments were clamoring for bigger populations;\r\nFrance was offering bonuses for large families. “Our babies are dying;\r\ngive us more babies.” Among European labor groups only the syndicalists\r\nof France had recognized excessive population as detrimental to the\r\nworking classes.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency in Germany of two million lives sacrificed in the War had\r\nbeen made up by the thousands returned from Alsace-Lorraine, from the\r\nformer province of Posen, and the deportees from England, France, and\r\nItaly. There were not nearly enough positions to go round. Yet the\r\nnationalists, who had tried to cover the bitter pill of imperialistic\r\nambitions with a sugar-coating of patriotism, still estimated the world\r\nin terms of numerical greatness and women as mere machines in the cradle\r\ncompetition of human production. Even the German Socialists, following\r\nin the footsteps of Marx, opposed Malthusianism vigorously in and out of\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nA Neo-Malthusian congress had been held in Dresden in 1912, but the\r\nmovement then organized by Maria Stritt had practically gone out of\r\nexistence and its place taken by a more popular demand for the right to\r\nabortion. For a single year the statistics of Berlin indicated that out\r\nof forty-four thousand known pregnancies twenty-three thousand were\r\nterminated by this means, though it was technically illegal. Women were\r\nnow campaigning for a bill before the Reichstag to permit operations to\r\nbe performed lawfully in hospitals, where fatalities could be reduced by\r\nproper sanitary care. Not one of those with whom I talked believed in\r\nabortion as a practice; it was the principle for which they were\r\nstanding. They were resolved to have no more babies for cannon fodder,\r\nnor until they could rear them properly.\r\n\r\nMost of the doctors whom I interviewed said that what Germany needed was\r\nchildren and lots of them. I asked one if the medical profession, as a\r\nwhole, were doing anything to prevent entrance into the world of those\r\nchildren whose backs were so weak that they could never sit up straight,\r\nwhose bones were too soft to hold the weight of their bodies. He\r\nanswered abruptly, “By aborting the mothers we are doing our best to\r\ncope with conditions as we find them. It is not our work to change\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nI was hounding everybody to learn the whereabouts of the contraceptive\r\nformula for which I was searching, and was finally given the name of a\r\ngynecologist who should know, if anybody did, where it could be found. I\r\nmade an appointment, and he greeted me in the most cordial way. When I\r\nquestioned him about the reported sterility of German women, he agreed\r\nwith the argument that, the situation being what it was in the country,\r\nthe population should be checked for the next five years. “Here is a\r\nfriend indeed,” I said to myself.\r\n\r\nI then gently brought up the subject of abortion. “Doesn’t this seem a\r\nridiculous substitute for contraceptives?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose, his chest sticking out; he buttoned his coat, bowed\r\nformally, and inquired, “Where did you say you came from?”\r\n\r\n“New York City.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you are not from France or Belgium?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody who has the welfare of Germany at heart could talk to me as you\r\nhave this morning. Only enemies could come here to give such information\r\nto our women.”\r\n\r\nI wished he would sit down; he made me nervous. But I went on. “Why is\r\nit such an act of enmity to advocate contraceptives rather than\r\nabortions? Abortions, as you know yourself, may be quite dangerous,\r\nwhereas reliable contraceptives are harmless. Why do you oppose them?”\r\n\r\nTo my horror he replied, “We will never give over the control of our\r\nnumbers to the women themselves. What, let them control the future of\r\nthe human race? With abortions it is in our hands; we make the\r\ndecisions, and they must come to us.”\r\n\r\nThat was not the tone of this doctor alone but also that of most of his\r\nconfrères.\r\n\r\nThinking that Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld might know about the formula,\r\nHavelock had given me a letter to him, and I presented it at the\r\nInstitute of Sex Psychology, where abnormalities were being studied and\r\ntreated. This most extraordinary mansion, bestowed by a prince of\r\nBavaria who had himself been cured of inversion by Dr. Hirschfeld, was\r\nfurnished sumptuously. On the walls of the stairway were pictures of\r\nhomosexuals—men decked out as women in huge hats, earrings, and feminine\r\nmake-up; also women in men’s clothing and toppers. Further up the steps\r\nwere photographs of the same individuals after they had been brought\r\nback to normality, some of them through adaptation of the Voronoff\r\nexperiments in the transplantation of sex glands. It was not a place I\r\nparticularly liked, although I was interested to see how a problem which\r\nhad cropped up everywhere in the post-War confusion was being attacked.\r\n\r\nDr. Hirschfeld was kind and gave me the address of a firm in Dresden\r\nwhich he believed might be manufacturing the formula, so off I went to\r\nthat city. It was memorable for my meeting with Maria Stritt, a darling\r\nlittle old lady, as quaint in her way as Dr. Vickery in hers. This tiny\r\naristocrat, like one of the dolls for which her city was famous, had a\r\nfine vigorous mind, and spoke English with care and a better choice of\r\nwords than most Americans. Again I made the rounds of the doctors and\r\nagain found none concerned over birth control; I went to the address\r\nwhere the formula was supposed to be, only to be directed on to Munich.\r\n\r\nMunich, to me the most lovely city in Germany, seemed the most\r\nprosperous of any I had visited. I noticed a difference immediately; the\r\nstreets were cleaner, the people less hungry-looking. There was more\r\nfood, more clothing in the shops, and much greater activity. It had\r\nalways been synonymous in my mind with music and _Liebfraumilch_, and I\r\nwas delighted to be asked to dine at a hotel which I was told was the\r\nsmartest and gayest in town. “Oh, we envy you. You’ll have dancing,\r\nyou’ll have wine, you’ll have everything.” But it turned out to be a\r\nnight club in the most blatant New York style, one table elbowing\r\nanother, the people—Germans, not tourists—dancing to last year’s jazz,\r\nthe whole place shrieking nouveaux riches. This, too, was part of\r\npost-War life.\r\n\r\nBavarian _Gemütlichkeit_ could not be altogether downed. On Saturdays\r\nthe trams were literally jammed with men and women, young and old, who\r\nhad put on their climbing clothes, donned their packs, and here hieing\r\nthemselves away to near-by resorts or to the hills. With them went their\r\nguitars or accordions, and when the singing began everybody knew all the\r\nwords—no tum-de-tum-de-tum. If they did not have their own instruments\r\nthere was sure to be a wandering musician to play, and the floors of\r\nevery hostelry or open-air _Biergarten_ were literally filled with\r\nwhirling, waltzing figures. Everyone seemed able to enter into the folk\r\ndances, although to me they appeared complicated—many steps, much\r\nprecision, and a great deal of dignity.\r\n\r\nHunger and poverty existed in plenty, however, in the city. Hospitals\r\nwere lacking in the simplest and most ordinary articles—no soap, no\r\ncod-liver oil, no rubber sheets, insufficient clean linen. Even the\r\nbabies had to lie all day in wet diapers, and consequently the poor\r\nlittle waifs were a sad, miserable lot. Another tragic thing which gave\r\nme nightmare for weeks was to see children’s mouths covered with running\r\nsores, because the sole available meat and milk came from cattle\r\nsuffering with hoof-and-mouth disease.\r\n\r\nHere at Munich the “birth strike” was most violent. The former medical\r\nchief of the Communists told me the women of Bavaria were determined to\r\nstop having babies; he himself had given information to thousands and\r\nhad intended to establish clinics all over the state had the Communist\r\nRepublic remained in power.\r\n\r\nOnly the preceding spring the Communist red flag had for three weeks\r\nflown from the house tops of Munich. I met representatives from both\r\nsides of the political arena. The middle- and upper-class conservatives\r\nclaimed the revolutionists had not been capable of managing affairs,\r\nbeing good agitators but not good organizers—able to start things but\r\nnot knowing how to finish them. They had not given up their guns; money\r\nhad been put aside and peasant costumes and boots were ready for escape,\r\nbecause the existing bitterness made it likely the struggle was not yet\r\nsettled. Communist leaders, on the other hand, claimed they had allowed\r\ntheir enemies to flee and then had been tricked and fooled, and knew at\r\nlast they could expect no quarter. Their ideals, their faith in\r\nhumanity, their consideration, had cost them their lives and liberty,\r\nand they would not forget this valuable lesson.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Communist Party I was introduced to Mrs. Erich\r\nMühsam who, with her husband and their friend Landau, had gone to the\r\nfront and distributed leaflets to call the boys back home. Landau, a\r\ngentle soul who so believed in the goodness of man that he had pleaded\r\nwith the soldiers to be brothers and not to take life, had been kicked\r\nand clubbed to death by the White Guard, which had afterwards marched to\r\nthe Mühsam apartment and, when they could not find anybody there, had\r\nwrecked it with machine guns. Fortunately for the Mühsams they were\r\nalready in jail.\r\n\r\nThough the Revolution was supposed to be over, Erich Mühsam was still\r\nimprisoned. In every country during such upheavals thousands are cast\r\ninto jail and, unless some other upheaval occurs to get them out, they\r\nremain there; many pacifists in the United States were not freed until\r\nlong after the Armistice.\r\n\r\nIn 1928 I saw Erich Mühsam—every inch a poet, an artistic and delicate\r\norganism, almost helpless-looking. In 1935, under Nazi rule, he was\r\nreturned to a concentration camp—a hangover on the black list.\r\n\r\nThe account of his fellow prisoners ran something like this: One\r\nafternoon he had been told to “report at headquarters and bring a rope.”\r\n\r\n“Where can I find a rope?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Get it!”\r\n\r\n“They’re going to kill you,” he was warned as he started out, still\r\nlacking a rope.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s just one of their jokes—a form of torture.”\r\n\r\n“You may be right; you’ve scarcely lifted a voice.”\r\n\r\nBut that evening his comrades discovered him dangling by the neck from a\r\nbeam. They said he could never have climbed up himself and that,\r\nfurthermore, he had been beaten to death before he had been hung there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, officially he had committed suicide.\r\n\r\nI met in Germany probably a hundred thorough-going conservatives and\r\nonly one Mühsam, and yet he it was who stood out spectacularly.\r\n\r\nMy own interests were keeping me busy enough. I finally found that the\r\nformula I was seeking was made in Friedrichshaven, on Lake Constance. I\r\ninitiated a correspondence with the chemist, asking him to come to\r\nMunich, and enclosing stamps to make sure of his reply. He could not\r\nmake the journey but, instead, invited me to Friedrichshaven.\r\n\r\nAll the passengers on dismounting at the station seemed to have someone\r\nto meet them except myself. I noticed a smallish man with what appeared\r\nto be bangs under his hat, front and back, standing on the platform and\r\nholding a tight bunch of wild flowers wrapped up in a newspaper, a\r\nmatching one in the buttonhole of his coat, but as far as I could see he\r\nwas serving no special purpose there. I went to a hotel, and in a very\r\nshort while the little man himself arrived, having identified me as the\r\nAmerican lady he had come to greet. His quaint bouquet was my welcome to\r\nFriedrichshaven.\r\n\r\nThe chemist, with his father and brothers, ran an unpretentious factory\r\nwhich, in addition to other products, was making the contraceptive in\r\nthe form of a jelly. It had been put out before the War, then dropped,\r\nand was now just starting up again and beginning to find a market in\r\nGermany. He feared to let me go near his establishment, suspicious that\r\nAmerica might steal his formula. But he showed me a picture of it, and\r\ngave me a few sample tubes, saying I could obtain others from his\r\nsister, who was going to act as his agent in New York. Thus was\r\ninaugurated a new phase in the movement—the use of a chemical\r\ncontraceptive.\r\n\r\nI had letters of introduction to several people in Russia, and had hoped\r\nto be able to go there, but I had commenced handing out my extra\r\ndresses, underwear, stockings, shoes in Berlin; my friends had so little\r\nand were so generous that I could not endure it, and now, in the face of\r\nan approaching winter of hardship, without wardrobe and no prospect of\r\nsecuring one or even sufficient food, I had to abandon the Russian plan.\r\n\r\nI had talked clinic, clinic, clinic while I was in England. Having\r\nmyself been convinced, I wanted the Neo-Malthusians also to believe that\r\nit was a better way than advice through literature. A few of them were\r\nassembling to meet me in the Netherlands, and thither I turned my steps.\r\nAs soon as the train north was over the border, cream was brought and\r\ndelicious fruit; the contrast between one side and the other was too\r\nobviously brutal and awful. It almost made me ill to see so many\r\ndelicacies in the Dutch shop windows when children in Germany were\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\nWith the Drysdales, to Amsterdam came Dr. Norman Haire, Australian born,\r\na gynecologist who had settled in London, sensed the public interest in\r\nbirth control, informed himself thoroughly on the subject, written a\r\ngreat deal about it, and become prominent in the movement, advocating\r\ncontraception from his Harley Street office.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Haire and I went around visiting clinics we found that the\r\ncountless stores where contraceptives were sold had fitting rooms in\r\nback with midwives in charge. They did not maintain the old Rutgers\r\nstandards. I was disappointed to see the deterioration which had taken\r\nplace since 1915. During the reorganization period of Europe the\r\ntendency, under Russian influence, was for young laborites to be in\r\ncharge of things, and they aimed to turn out Dr. Rutgers and the Dutch\r\nNeo-Malthusians and put clinics, which were dedicated to the workers, on\r\na strictly utilitarian basis. Here as elsewhere they could agitate and\r\ntear apart but lacked executive ability. The new board, composed mainly\r\nof laymen, did not realize that such technical knowledge and experience\r\nwas required as only a physician like Dr. Rutgers possessed. He was a\r\nsad and unhappy man, profoundly discouraged over the odds against which\r\nhe had to struggle.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, my English friends were converted to the idea of clinics,\r\nand Bessie Drysdale and Dr. Haire planned to open one soon in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-three_\r\n\r\n                       IN TIME WE ONLY CAN BEGIN\r\n\r\n           “_Enough, ’tis the word of a Grand Bashaw;\r\n           You needn’t to bother about the law.\r\n           He told me they wasn’t to speak at all,\r\n           You don’t need a warrant to clear a hall.\r\n           He told me to tell them to stir their stumps;\r\n           When ‘Clubs!’ is the order, then clubs is trumps.\r\n           What else would it be when I’m just a cop\r\n           And he is a Reverend Archbishop?_”\r\n                                   ARTHUR GUITERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn confirming my conviction in 1918, Judge Frederick E. Crane of the\r\nAppellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York had for the first\r\ntime interpreted the section of the state law which permitted a licensed\r\nphysician to give contraceptive advice for the “cure or prevention of\r\ndisease”; and, further, he had taken from _Webster’s Dictionary_ the\r\nbroad definition of disease as any alteration in the state of body which\r\ncaused or threatened pain and sickness, thus extending the meaning of\r\nthe word far beyond the original scope of syphilis and gonorrhea. But,\r\nnever satisfied, I wanted women to have birth control for economic and\r\nsocial reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in January, 1921, Anne Kennedy and I went to Albany to find a\r\nsponsor for a bill which was to change the New York law. It was not only\r\na question of amending it, but also a means of educating the public, of\r\nexplaining our cause through the medium of legislation. Months of\r\npreparation were required, hours of tramping the floors of State\r\nbuildings at Albany, interviewing one person after another, securing\r\npromises of help, breaking down hostility.\r\n\r\nWhen people said that women who would not have children were selfish and\r\npreferred lap dogs, I replied, “All right. Then it is better for the\r\nchildren not to be born.” That type of woman should die out\r\nbiologically, just as did the different species that were caught in the\r\nmire and slime and could not reproduce themselves. It is a principle\r\nthat applies to human beings also, that they must work through their\r\nenvironment in order to survive.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you could get out of people’s minds what birth control was\r\nnot, they almost invariably said, “Why, yes, certainly, that sounds\r\nreasonable.” Many of the lawmakers themselves believed that the measure\r\nmight be of great benefit, but the party whip cut too deeply.\r\n\r\nBirth control was once described by Heywood Broun as dynamite from the\r\npoint of view of the politician. If he supported it, he might lose\r\nvotes; if he opposed it, he might lose votes. “There is nothing a\r\npolitician hates more than losing votes. He would much rather the\r\nsubject never came up.”\r\n\r\nOne assemblyman from Brooklyn at first agreed to introduce our bill and\r\nthen wrote, “I very much regret, but after consulting with some of the\r\nleaders of the Assembly, I have been strongly advised not to offer your\r\nbill. I am told it would do me an injury that I could not overcome for\r\nsome time.” Another refused on the ground of “levity from his\r\nassociates.” But a few years later we found a young, courageous\r\nlegislator who introduced a bill and secured hearings. Although it was\r\ndefeated, the atmosphere was clarified.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hepburn, who had been in the suffrage movement early and had been\r\none of the sponsors of Mrs. Pankhurst’s tour of the United States, now\r\nlived in Hartford, Connecticut. Although the mother of six, including\r\nthe actress, Katherine, she retained her youthful face and figure, being\r\nalmost like a sister to her children, playmate and companion for them at\r\ntennis, golf, and swimming. Young men asked her to dinner with the same\r\npleasure that they asked her daughters.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with her was Mrs. George H. Day, Sr., a grandmother\r\nin 1921. She always came from Hartford for every Board meeting of the\r\nLeague and, in turn, her house was a place of refuge for poor, worn-down\r\nfriends of causes. They could go there and be ministered to by a staff\r\nof servants and come back, rested and rejuvenated.\r\n\r\nWith two such seasoned campaigners to back us, we carried our\r\nlegislative activities into Connecticut, the only state where “to use a\r\ncontraceptive” was a crime—as though it were possible to have a\r\npoliceman in every home! A mere six years had elapsed since the movement\r\nhad begun; consequently, that we were now able to get a hearing was in\r\nitself a triumph. Nevertheless, no easy task faced us; so much red tape\r\nhad to be broken through. But here at Hartford we did succeed in finding\r\nan introducer who could hold his own under ridicule. Then we had to\r\neducate him, feed him with facts—medical, social, historical—so that he\r\ncould defend his bill.\r\n\r\nA young priest stood forth as our chief opponent, basing his objections\r\non the laws of nature, which he claimed were contravened by birth\r\ncontrol. Fortunately the committee had a sense of humor. In my\r\nten-minute rebuttal I was able to answer the “against nature” argument\r\nas Francis Place had done a hundred years earlier. I turned the priest’s\r\nown words on himself by asking why he should counteract nature’s decree\r\nof impaired vision by wearing eyeglasses, and why, above all, was he\r\ncelibate, thus outraging nature’s primary demand on the human species—to\r\npropagate its kind. The laughter practically ended the “unnatural”\r\nthesis for some time.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey another attempt was made. The law there allowed doctors to\r\ngive information for “a just cause,” but they were fearful of including\r\nminor ailments under this interpretation. The bill introduced at Trenton\r\nhad a hearing, but it also failed to pass.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was nerve-wracking but was part of the experience we\r\ngained. And, furthermore, whenever we had hearings, the local work\r\nprogressed much more rapidly as a result. Nothing was lost, however\r\nexpensive the plowing and sowing. Apparent defeats were victories in the\r\nlong run.\r\n\r\nIt then seemed to me from glancing over current clippings and\r\npublications that people all over the world were discussing birth\r\ncontrol. The English Baron Dawson of Penn had been Court Physician to\r\nEdward VII and had continued in this same post during the reign of\r\nGeorge V. But he had broader interests, too. One of the great events in\r\nthe history of the movement was his speech at the Church Congress at\r\nBirmingham in answer to the doctrine promulgated by the Bishops at\r\nLambeth that sexual union should take place for the purpose of\r\nprocreation only:\r\n\r\n  Imagine a young married couple in love with each other being\r\n  expected to occupy the same room and to abstain for two years. The\r\n  thing is preposterous. You might as well put water by the side of a\r\n  man suffering from thirst, and tell him not to drink it. Romance and\r\n  deliberate self-restraint do not to my mind rhyme very well\r\n  together. A touch of madness to begin with does no harm. Heaven\r\n  knows life sobers it soon enough.\r\n\r\nHis speech caused an immense sensation throughout England. Headlines and\r\nstreamers announced, “King’s Physician asks Church to sanction birth\r\ncontrol.” The deduction was that His Majesty was endorsing it, and\r\nstolid Britishers were all agog at the idea that Buckingham Palace was\r\nnow talking about the subject; it was hinted Queen Mary was not\r\nover-pleased.\r\n\r\nOn this side of the Atlantic Major General John J. O’Ryan, who had\r\ncommanded the Twenty-Seventh National Guard Division, lectured on\r\noverpopulation as a cause for war. Frank Vanderlip, once Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and later President of the National City Bank,\r\nhad just returned from Japan, proclaiming that population must be\r\ncontrolled because some countries could no longer feed themselves. Here\r\nwas an army man on the one hand, and a financier on the other, unprimed,\r\nuncoerced, even uninvited, speaking out of their independent\r\nexperiences. They were voices in the wilderness, oases in the desert,\r\nand certainly encouraging historical landmarks.\r\n\r\nAmong uneasy experts the sentiment was growing that population pressure\r\nin Japan would soon create an inevitable explosion. Indeed, one of the\r\nfamiliar arguments in the United States brought forward against birth\r\ncontrol was the “menace of the Yellow Peril,” by which was meant\r\nspecifically, Japan. What folly to reduce our birth rate when Orientals\r\nwere multiplying so appallingly fast that the downfall of Western\r\ncivilization might soon be looked for! India and China were teeming\r\nindiscriminately, but their peoples were feeble, inert, and diseased;\r\nwhereas the Japanese were being reared under German health traditions,\r\nwere ninety-seven percent literate, and were technically equipped for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nNaturally I was eager to learn as much about this situation as possible,\r\nand welcomed the opportunity to meet the Nipponese friends of Gertrude\r\nBoyle, who had married a gentleman of Japan. They always appeared in\r\npairs or groups of three, four, five at a time, talking busily in asides\r\nwith each other while I exchanged opinions with one. They were helpful\r\nin furnishing me with unpublished facts; the older, conservative,\r\nnationalist, militarist party advocated greater numbers, but the young,\r\nliberal intellectuals, many of whom had attended Occidental\r\nuniversities, could see the clouds already lowering on the horizon and\r\nhoped the storm could be averted by controlled population growth. Atro,\r\na reporter on a New York Japanese paper, had been supplying the\r\nlast-named group, which in Tokyo called itself Kaizo, meaning\r\nreconstruction, with clippings about birth control, and several of my\r\narticles had been printed in their publication.\r\n\r\nThe women’s point of view was graphically described to me by the\r\nBaroness Shidzué Ishimoto, daughter of the head of the great Hirota clan\r\nand wife of Baron Keikichi Ishimoto, a young nobleman who had put in\r\npractice his ideals of service. This charming, youthful and gracious\r\nmatron, tall for her race and equally beautiful by our standards, very\r\nsmart in her American street costume, had in 1919 come from her own land\r\nwhere suffrage for women was still mentioned in awed tones. She had\r\nstudied our language at a Y.W.C.A. business school, and in three months\r\nhad performed the extraordinary accomplishment of mastering it\r\nsufficiently to speak, write, and even take dictation in English.\r\n\r\nWe quickly became friends and she at once foresaw the possibilities of\r\nbirth control in bringing Japanese women out of their long suppression\r\nin the family system. She said she intended to form a league immediately\r\nupon her arrival in Tokyo, and did so in 1921.\r\n\r\nDuring that year also clinics were started in England. That of Marie\r\nStopes proved popular, although instruction, given by a midwife, was\r\nlimited to mothers who had already had at least one child. Shortly\r\nafterwards Dr. Haire and Bessie Drysdale, with Harold Cox as chairman of\r\na lay group to finance the work, established Walworth Center, which had\r\na fine gynecological thoroughness and set an example which later clinics\r\nin England followed.\r\n\r\nIt was high time clinics were started in the United States as well.\r\nAfter the Crane decision I had anticipated that hospitals were going to\r\ngive contraceptive advice. But in 1919, under Dr. Mary Halton’s\r\ndirection, two women, the first with tuberculosis, the other with\r\nsyphilis, had been taken from one to another institution on Manhattan\r\nIsland. All had refused such information, although most had agreed that\r\nthe patients, if pregnant, could be aborted. The officers in charge had\r\nsaid they were obliged to protect their charters, and the staff\r\nphysicians their licenses and reputations.\r\n\r\nAnything depending on the organized medicine is hard to put over; though\r\nindividual doctors may break away, in the long run most medical progress\r\nproceeds by group action.\r\n\r\nSince the hospitals were laggard in this matter, I decided to open a\r\nsecond clinic of my own. It was to be in effect a laboratory dealing in\r\nhuman beings instead of mice, with every consideration for environment,\r\npersonality, and background. I was going to suggest to women that in the\r\nTwentieth Century they give themselves to science as they had in the\r\npast given their lives to religion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual rooms I planned to have a day nursery where\r\nchildren could be kept amused and happy while the mothers were being\r\ninstructed. A properly chosen staff could enable us to have weekly\r\nsessions on prenatal care and marital adjustment. Gynecologists were to\r\nrefer patients to hospitals if pregnancy jeopardized life; a specialist\r\nwas to advise women in overcoming sterility; a consultant was to deal\r\nwith eugenics; and, finally, since anxiety and fear of pregnancy were\r\noften the psychological causes of ill health, a psychiatrist was to be\r\nadded. I intended, furthermore, that it should be a nucleus for research\r\non scientific methods of contraception; domestically manufactured\r\nsupplies of tested efficacy could not, at that time, be procured.\r\n\r\nBecause organized medical support was lacking, I tried to see what could\r\nbe done with individuals, writing to various doctors to inquire whether\r\nthey were willing to sponsor such an undertaking. Several asked me what\r\nmethods I was recommending, but Dr. Emmett Holt, then the outstanding\r\npediatrician of New York, whose book, _The Care and Feeding of\r\nChildren_, was the bible of thousands of mothers, invited me to come to\r\nhis office; before making any endorsement he wanted to know more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI packed up all my European supplies and showed them and explained them\r\nto Dr. Holt, who had called in also an obstetrician and a neurologist,\r\nDr. Frederick Peterson, for the discussion. The usual attitude of the\r\nchild specialist was, “Our living depends upon babies. Why should we\r\nadvocate limiting the supply? The more the merrier. If you cut down,\r\nyou’re taking our maintenance from us.” But Dr. Holt said, “A thoroughly\r\nreliable contraceptive would be a godsend to us. If the family cannot\r\nafford a nurse we must rely on the health and strength of the mother to\r\nkeep her baby alive. If pregnancy can be postponed for a few years, not\r\nonly the baby who has been born, but the baby who comes after is much\r\nmore likely to survive.”\r\n\r\nDr. Holt lent us his name, one of the first important physicians to do\r\nso, thus setting an example which eventually others followed. Five or\r\nsix men and women doctors agreed to stand behind the clinic.\r\n\r\nBut I had to have more than verbal approval. Unless the clinic were to\r\nbe conducted by a doctor with a New York practicing license, it would\r\nnot be there to stay. In early autumn I brought together an interested\r\ngroup to discuss the possibility of a location on the East Side near\r\nStuyvesant Square, and Dr. Lydia Allen de Vilbiss, whom I had met at the\r\nIndianapolis social workers’ conference, was going to form her own\r\nmedical committee behind her and build it up. On the basis of her\r\npromise, I signed a year’s lease for a small suite of rooms at 317 East\r\nTenth Street, from which a dentist had just moved out, appropriately\r\nsituated on the ground floor in a densely populated section.\r\n\r\nThe legislative activities and planning for a clinic had taken much of\r\nmy attention during the year, but the central theme was the\r\ndetermination to hold the First National Birth Control Conference,\r\nNovember 11–13, 1921, at the Plaza Hotel in New York. I timed it\r\npurposely to coincide with a meeting of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation, hoping that if we could only convince these officials of\r\nthe need for birth control, they would use it in their own work.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the health aspect, we planned to treat of population and\r\nalso have a doctors’ meeting on methods and technique. But “flaming\r\nyouth” was having its fling, and the great clamor of the moment was\r\ndirected towards the moral issue. Opponents were constantly hurling the\r\nstatement that immorality among young people was to be the inevitable\r\nfruit of our efforts. This I did not believe. I knew that neither\r\nmorality nor immorality was an external factor in human behavior;\r\nessentially these qualities grew and emerged from within. If the youth\r\nof the post-War era were slipping away from sanctioned codes, it was not\r\nthe fault of birth control knowledge any more than it was the fault of\r\nthe automobile, which made transportation to the bright lights of the\r\ncity quick and easy. Immorality as a result should not be placed at the\r\ndoor of Messrs. Ford or Chrysler.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a free and fair hearing we proposed a large open\r\nmeeting to wind up the Conference, and invited ministry and clergy of\r\nall denominations, including Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes, who was the\r\nspokesman of the Catholic Church in New York.\r\n\r\nThe movement was older in England and had already established its\r\ndignity there. Consequently, the presence at the Conference of such an\r\noutstanding Englishman as Harold Cox was certain to carry weight. To\r\npersuade him to take the sea voyage I sailed for Europe. When I arrived\r\nin London I found him unwell, and his doctors at first refused him\r\npermission to travel. Under the circumstances it was very fine of him to\r\npromise to come. J. O. P. Bland also said he would look in on the\r\nConference if only to give it his blessing. He was a dark-haired, witty,\r\namusing North-of-Irishman who had lived much in the Orient and become an\r\nauthority on Far Eastern matters, an internationalist in all his\r\nthinking. He was one of those who always helped to hold up your right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nMy object in England having been attained, I went on to Switzerland with\r\na definite aim; I had formed a habit in my nursing days, when I was\r\nwaiting in the night to give medicine or treatment to a patient, of\r\noccupying the time putting down experiences and thoughts that came to\r\nme. The same habit continued. After lectures, while I was still sizzling\r\nwith excitement, I often relieved the tenseness by writing down answers\r\nto questions I feared I had not covered adequately. Before I knew it I\r\nhad material gathered for a book, and even some chapters in rough draft.\r\nThey needed pulling together and polishing off and I went to bed in\r\nMontreux for a month to do this. I had regarded _Woman and the New Race_\r\nas my heart book; this, _The Pivot of Civilization_, was to be my head\r\nbook. I brought it back with me to the United States and Wells, who was\r\nreporting the Washington Disarmament Conference for the New York\r\n_World_, wrote an introduction.\r\n\r\nTo make our Conference a success it had to be under the auspices of an\r\norganization. I had always had a dread of them. I knew their weaknesses\r\nand the stifling effect they could have. They seemed heavy and\r\nponderous, rigid, lifeless, and soulless, often caught in their own\r\nmechanism to become dead wood, thus defeating the very purposes for\r\nwhich they had initially been established. Even the women who were able\r\nand clever at systematizing such bodies terrified me with their\r\nrule-and-rote minds, their weight-and-measure tactics; they appeared so\r\nsure, so positive that I felt as if I were in the way of a giant tractor\r\nwhich destroyed mercilessly as it went.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this dread I had reasoned out the necessity for an\r\norganization to tie up the loose ends. Although it might be limiting and\r\ninhibiting to the individual, it had other advantages of strength and\r\nsolidity which would enable it to function when the individual was gone.\r\nTherefore I sent a questionnaire to leaders in social and professional\r\ncircles, asking them whether the time had not come for such a national\r\nassociation; the replies almost unanimously confirmed this decision.\r\n\r\nThe evening before the Conference was to open, a few friends gathered\r\ntogether to launch the American Birth Control League. Its aims were to\r\nbuild up public opinion so that women should demand instruction from\r\ndoctors, to assemble the findings of scientists, to remove hampering\r\nFederal statutes, to send out field workers into those states where laws\r\ndid not prevent clinics, to co-operate with similar bodies in studying\r\npopulation problems, food supplies, world peace. After the dinner, given\r\nat Mrs. George F. Rublee’s home, we talked over specific plans for the\r\nyear and set in motion the machinery for having the League incorporated.\r\n\r\nJuliet Barrett Rublee had been one of the pioneers, a member of the\r\noriginal Committee of One Hundred, and all the way through the years she\r\nhas never wavered from my side. No more inspired idealist was ever\r\ninitiated into a movement. The imagination of this picturesque, romantic\r\nwife of a conservative lawyer had been so fired that she dedicated to it\r\nher entire devotion, loyalty, partisanship. Others had rallied their own\r\npersonal friends around the idea, but Juliet’s influence brought in her\r\nhusband’s associates—the Cravaths, Morrows, Lamonts, Dodges, and\r\nBlisses.\r\n\r\nJuliet’s parties were always gay and interesting, with an atmosphere\r\nnobody else could create. Her small, engaging dining room was as\r\ncolorful as she herself—the only woman I ever knew who dared to wear\r\nbright greens, reds, yellows, all together. For lunches, teas, and\r\ndinners in behalf of the cause she practically turned over her home in\r\nTurtle Bay Gardens.\r\n\r\nA goodly number attended the opening of our Conference, which,\r\nappropriately, coincided with that of the great disarmament conference\r\nat Washington. The medical meeting, where contraceptive technique was\r\ndiscussed, was so crowded that latecomers could not squeeze in. The\r\ndoctors who did find places, each apparently surprised to see his\r\nconfrères there, expected us to have a hundred percent sound methods;\r\nthey seemed disappointed because we had no magic up our sleeves and told\r\nthem quite frankly we had not. The best we could do was show what\r\ndevices were being employed, including those from the Netherlands and\r\nthe preparation I had found at Friedrichshaven, with the warning that\r\nthey had not been tested for efficacy.\r\n\r\nAfter two full days nothing remained but the Sunday evening mass meeting\r\non “Birth Control, Is It Moral?” For this we had selected the Town Hall\r\non West Forty-third Street, a new club designed as a forum for adult\r\neducation; the auditorium was often used for discussion of questions of\r\ncivic interest. Harold Cox was to deliver the first speech and I was to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAlways, when I am to speak, I attempt to visualize the hall and the\r\naudience in order to feel my way into the subject. When I cannot do so,\r\nI have invariably been met by blocked doors. Throughout Sunday, try as I\r\nwould to “tune in” to the approaching event, I could not do it. I kept\r\nremembering a dream I had had the night before in which I was carrying a\r\nsmall baby in my arms up a very steep hill and came rather abruptly to a\r\nslope which became a mountain side of rock and slippery shale; I had\r\nnothing to grasp to prevent me from sliding. The baby cried continually\r\nand I wanted to comfort it, but I dared not use my right hand because it\r\nwas held up like a balancing rod which saved us both from falling. That\r\nmiserable dream made me drowsy all day. My brain seemed numb. I simply\r\ncould not think of what I was going to say.\r\n\r\nAnne Kennedy had gone ahead to the Town Hall at about seven o’clock.\r\nHarold Cox and I had dined at Juliet’s but I could not eat; I was\r\ninterested neither in the food nor the conversation. I still had an\r\nabsolute blank in front of me. Juliet was congratulating me that soon,\r\nwith the Conference over, I could have a rest. Ordinarily when I am\r\napproaching the end of a particular job I begin to feel released, but\r\nthis time I could not reassure her; I was nervous, anxious, and\r\napprehensive.\r\n\r\nOur taxi swung into West Forty-third Street and crept cautiously along\r\nthrough a swarming aggregation. “Heavens!” I said. “This _is_ an\r\noverflow with a vengeance.”\r\n\r\nWe dismounted and pushed our way to the Town Hall doors. They were\r\nclosed and two policemen barred our path when Mr. Cox and I attempted to\r\nenter. “This gentleman is one of the speakers and I am another,” I said.\r\n“Why can’t we go in?”\r\n\r\n“There ain’t gonna be no meeting. That’s all I can say.”\r\n\r\nI had not the faintest idea of what was happening. A newspaper man\r\nstanding near by suggested, “Why not call up Police Commissioner Enright\r\nand see what the trouble is?”\r\n\r\nJuliet and I rushed across the street to a booth and she telephoned\r\npolice headquarters. No one could say where the Commissioner was. As far\r\nas they knew no orders to forbid the meeting had been issued.\r\n\r\nThen I put through a call for Mayor Hylan. While I was waiting for the\r\nconnection I kept my eyes on the Town Hall entrance and saw that\r\npolicemen were cautiously opening the doors to let out driblets of\r\npeople. If they could get out I could get in, so I abandoned the\r\ntelephone and wove my way through the throng until I reached the doors,\r\nslipping in under the policemen’s arms before they could stop me.\r\nDignified health officers from all over the country, lawyers and judges\r\nwith their families and guests were standing about, grumbling, vague,\r\nreluctant to depart, wondering what to do.\r\n\r\nI fairly flew up the aisle but halted in front of the footlights; they\r\nwere as high as my head and another blue uniform was obstructing the\r\nsteps leading to the stage. Suddenly Lothrop Stoddard, the author, tall\r\nand strong, seized me and literally tossed me up to the platform. A\r\nmessenger boy was aimlessly grasping flowers which were to be presented\r\nafter my speech. Stoddard grabbed them briskly, handed them to me, and\r\nshouted, “Here’s Mrs. Sanger!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave!” I called to the audience. “We’re going to hold the\r\nmeeting.”\r\n\r\nA great scramble began to get back into the seats. The hall was in a\r\nturmoil; the front doors had been stampeded and those in the street were\r\npressing in, only to find their places gone. The boxes and galleries\r\nwere soon filled, the stage was jammed, hundreds were crowded in the\r\nrear. I cried, “Get in out of the aisles!” I knew the meeting could be\r\nlegally closed if they were blocked, and I did not want fire regulations\r\nto be used as a pretext.\r\n\r\nI still had no idea of what had gone on earlier when I commenced my\r\nlecture, but had uttered no more than ten or twelve words when two\r\npolicemen loomed up beside me and said, “You can’t talk here.” A\r\nthundering applause broke out as though it were the only relief for\r\nangry, indignant, rebellious spirits.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t I?”\r\n\r\nI started again but my voice could not be heard. I then suggested to\r\nHarold Cox, “Perhaps they’ll let you speak. Try it.” This white-haired\r\nand pink-cheeked gentleman walked to the edge of the platform with a\r\ndignity of bearing about as distantly removed from immorality as could\r\nbe imagined. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, “I have come from across\r\nthe Atlantic—” but that was as far as he got before he was led back to\r\nhis seat by a policeman.\r\n\r\nThen Mary Winsor, an ardent suffragette, sprang up, but they stopped her\r\nalso. As soon as one was downed, another jumped to his or her feet. I\r\ndid not know the names of some of the volunteers, who were not even\r\nallowed to finish their “Ladies and gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Anne Kennedy was telling me as best she could what had\r\nhappened prior to my arrival. When the house had been half filled, a man\r\nhad come to the platform and asked, “Who’s in charge?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” Anne had answered.\r\n\r\n“This meeting must be closed.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“An indecent, immoral subject is to be discussed. It cannot be held.”\r\n\r\n“On what authority? Are you from the police?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m Monsignor Dineen, the Secretary of Archbishop Hayes.”\r\n\r\n“What right has he to interfere?”\r\n\r\n“He has the right.” Here he turned to a policeman. “Captain, speak up.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” Anne had demanded.\r\n\r\n“I’m Captain Donohue of this district. The meeting must be stopped.”\r\n\r\nCapable and cool-headed Anne had replied, “Very well, we’ll write this\r\ndown and I’ll read it to the audience. ‘I, Captain Thomas Donohue, of\r\nthe Twenty-sixth Precinct, at the order of Monsignor Joseph P. Dineen,\r\nSecretary to Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes, have ordered this meeting\r\nclosed.’”\r\n\r\nThe listeners had sat petrified while she had read them this strange\r\nadmission. No hissing or booing then. They had just sat. It was one\r\nthing to have the hall shut by a mistaken or misguided police captain; a\r\nvery different thing to have it done by a high dignitary of the Roman\r\nCatholic hierarchy.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Dineen was now stationed in the back of the hall, and Anne\r\npointed him out to me, of medium size, in plain attire, calmly directing\r\nthe police by a casual nod of the head or a whisper to a man who acted\r\nas runner between him and the Captain on the platform.\r\n\r\nConfusion and tumult continued for at least an hour. Newspaper men were\r\nscribbling stories; those who could not get in were creating commotion\r\noutside; the reserves had been summoned. It was bedlam. Miss Winsor\r\ntried to speak two or three times; I, at least ten. But I knew that I\r\nhad to keep on until I was arrested in order that free speech might be\r\nmade the issue. To allow yourself to be sent home at the order of the\r\npolice was accepting the police point of view as to what was moral.\r\nMoreover you were bound for the principle of the thing to carry it into\r\nthe court for a legal decision; if the pulpit and press were denied you,\r\nyou must take it to the dock.\r\n\r\nCaptain Donohue kept repeating to me, “Please get off this stage before\r\nyou cause disorder.” Police now began to hustle the audience towards\r\nhalf a dozen exits, and finally Miss Winsor and I were put under arrest;\r\nRobert McC. Marsh, Mrs. Delafield’s son-in-law, offered to act as our\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nJuliet said to an officer, “Why don’t you arrest me too?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can come along if you like,” he agreed. So we walked together\r\nup Broadway to the station at West Forty-seventh Street, policemen\r\nflanking us. The crowd, still jeering the reserves, who had been trying\r\nvainly to clear the way, fell in line and marched behind us. A patrol\r\nwagon then took us to night court where we were arraigned before\r\nMagistrate McQuade. Someone had telephoned J.J. and he came up later,\r\nbut Mr. Marsh had already taken care of the necessary formalities. We\r\nwere released on our own recognizances, to appear at court the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIt was now some time after midnight, but we all went back to Juliet’s\r\napartment. Harold Cox was shocked, not only by the roughness of the\r\npolice, but also by the supineness of the audience, which had done\r\nnothing but make a noise. “Had this been in London, they would never\r\nhave been able to stop the meeting! We would have defended our rights,\r\nused every chair and door and window to barricade the place, even though\r\nwe might have been beaten in the end.”\r\n\r\nAnne Kennedy had brought the reporters, and they were waiting for us.\r\nThey wanted to make out a story of police stupidity and let it go at\r\nthat, unable to believe her when she told them it was the Archbishop who\r\nwas responsible. A _Times_ reporter called up the “Power House,” as St.\r\nPatrick’s Cathedral was colloquially termed, reached Dineen himself, and\r\nasked for verification. “Yes,” said the Monsignor, “we closed the\r\nmeeting.”\r\n\r\nThen and there we decided to hold a second one as soon as possible at\r\nthe same place.\r\n\r\nIt was well on towards five o’clock when at last I fell in my bed. I\r\nsank to slumber, but it was only to find myself still carrying that same\r\nbaby up the steep and sliding mountain, balancing myself with upraised\r\nhand. The sky was dark, the way unmarked. Wearily I stumbled on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-four_\r\n\r\n                         LAWS WERE LIKE COBWEBS\r\n\r\n                    “_And heard great argument,\r\n              About it and about; but evermore\r\n              Came out by the same door wherein I went._”\r\n                                  EDWARD FITZGERALD\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly at nine the morning after the wretched Town Hall affair Miss\r\nWinsor and I appeared before Magistrate Joseph E. Corrigan and the case\r\nwas dismissed in five minutes. Neither Monsignor Dineen nor Captain\r\nDonohue was in court. Here was a ridiculous thing—the Catholic Church\r\nheld such power in its hands that it could issue orders to the police,\r\ndissolve an important gathering of adult and intelligent men and women,\r\nand send them home as though they were naughty children—and then not\r\nfeel called upon to give any accounting.\r\n\r\nThe papers expressed the greatest indignation. Even the most\r\nconservative were placed in the trying situation of defending birth\r\ncontrol advocates or endorsing a violation of the principle of free\r\nspeech, which “must always find defenders if democracy is to survive.”\r\nIt was to be expected that the _World_ would be up in arms, but the\r\n_Times_ carried a headline that Archbishop Hayes had closed the meeting,\r\nand the _Tribune_ was spurred on by the indignation of Mrs. Ogden Reid,\r\nwho had been present at the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nApparently the Church had not expected to render any explanation\r\nwhatsoever. Then, faced with a battery of reporters, Monsignor Dineen\r\nmade a statement:\r\n\r\n  The Archbishop had received an invitation from Mrs. Margaret Sanger\r\n  to attend the meeting, and I went as his representative. The\r\n  Archbishop is delighted and pleased at the action of the police, as\r\n  am I, because ... I think any one will admit that a meeting of that\r\n  character is no place for growing children.... The presence of these\r\n  four children at least was a reason for police action.\r\n\r\nHe had not improved his position. The scoffing was redoubled when it was\r\nlearned that the four “children” were students of Professor Raymond\r\nMoley’s class in sociology at Columbia University; Monsignor Dineen had\r\nnot seen beyond their bobbed hair.\r\n\r\nOnly a small section of the public had been aware of our modest little\r\nconference; even fewer had known of the proposed Town Hall meeting. Now\r\nthe publicity was tremendous. Many Catholics themselves condemned Church\r\ntactics, and Archbishop Hayes had to defend himself:\r\n\r\n  As a citizen and a churchman, deeply concerned with the moral\r\n  well-being of our city, I feel it a public duty to protest ... in\r\n  the interest of thousands of ... distressed mothers, who are alarmed\r\n  at the daring of the advocates of birth control in bringing out into\r\n  an open, unrestricted, free meeting a discussion of a subject that\r\n  simple prudence and decency, if not the spirit of the law, should\r\n  keep within the walls of a clinic.... The law was enacted under the\r\n  police power of the Legislature for the benefit of the morals and\r\n  health of the community.... The law of God and man, science, public\r\n  policy, human experience, are all condemnatory of birth control as\r\n  preached by a few irresponsible individuals.\r\n\r\n  The seventh child has been regarded traditionally with some peoples\r\n  as the most favored by nature. Benjamin Franklin was the fifteenth\r\n  child, John Wesley the eighteenth, Ignatius Loyola was the eighth,\r\n  Catherine of Siena, one of the greatest intellectual women who ever\r\n  lived, was the twenty-fourth. It has been suggested that one of the\r\n  reasons for the lack of genius in our day is that we are not getting\r\n  the ends of the families.\r\n\r\nThis statement appeared synchronously with our second meeting. The Town\r\nHall had been booked ahead for several weeks; consequently, we had\r\nengaged the big Park Theater in Columbus Circle. It was packed fifteen\r\nminutes after a single door was opened. Dr. Karl Reiland of St. George’s\r\nChurch was a new recruit on the platform; otherwise our program was the\r\nsame as before, and a balanced and poised discussion proceeded without\r\nacrimony or excitement. Outside, however, two thousand people were\r\nclamoring to get in, even climbing up the fire escapes. Orators were\r\nharanguing from soapboxes, men were pounding each other with their\r\nfists, Paulist fathers were selling pamphlets against birth control.\r\n\r\nIn my open letter of reply to Archbishop Hayes I said:\r\n\r\n  I agree with the Archbishop that a clinic is the proper place to\r\n  give information on birth control.... I wish, however, to point out\r\n  the fact that there are two sides to the subject under\r\n  consideration—the practical information as distinct from the\r\n  theoretical discussion. The latter rightly may be discussed on the\r\n  public platform and in the press as the Archbishop himself has taken\r\n  the opportunity to do.\r\n\r\nAnd then, citing Scripture:\r\n\r\n  If the Archbishop will recall his Bible history, he will find that\r\n  some of the more remarkable characters were the first children, and\r\n  often the only child as well. For instance, Isaac was an only child,\r\n  born after long years of preparation. Isaac’s only children were\r\n  twins—Jacob, the father of all Israel, and Esau. Samuel, who judged\r\n  Israel for forty years, was an only child. John the Baptist was an\r\n  only child, and his parents were well along in years when he was\r\n  born.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Hayes delivered his final pronunciamento in his Christmas\r\nPastoral:\r\n\r\n  Children troop down from Heaven because God wills it. He alone has\r\n  the right to stay their coming, while He blesses at will some homes\r\n  with many, others with but few or with none at all.... Even though\r\n  some little angels in the flesh through moral, mental, or physical\r\n  deformity of parents may appear to human eyes hideous, misshapen, a\r\n  blot on civilized society, we must not lose sight of this Christian\r\n  thought that under and within such visible malformation there lives\r\n  an immortal soul to be saved and glorified for all eternity among\r\n  the blessed in Heaven.\r\n\r\n  Heinous is the sin committed against the creative act of God, who\r\n  through the marriage contract invites man and woman to co-operate\r\n  with him in the propagation of the human family. To take life after\r\n  its inception is a horrible crime; but to prevent human life that\r\n  the Creator is about to bring into being is satanic. In the first\r\n  instance, the body is killed, while the soul lives on; in the\r\n  latter, not only a body, but an immortal soul is denied existence in\r\n  time and in eternity. It has been reserved to our day to see\r\n  advocated shamelessly the legalizing of such a diabolical thing.\r\n\r\nA monstrous doctrine and one abhorrent to every civilized instinct, that\r\nchildren, misshapen, deformed, hideous to the eye, either mentally or\r\nconstitutionally unequipped for life, should continue to be born in the\r\nhope that Heaven might be filled!\r\n\r\nGeneral opinion was that controversy gave us free publicity, and it did,\r\ncolumn after column, but to my mind it was of the negative kind. The\r\ntruths falsified and motives aspersed had to be debated, corrected, and\r\nargued away, and this took time from constructive work. The press wanted\r\nto keep up the excitement and manufacture news, but I did not. As a\r\nmatter of fact the hullabaloo was usually done for me; the blundering of\r\nthe opposition often saved my voice.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence through the press was dropped, but meanwhile the\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, spurred on by Albert de Silver, from\r\nwhom we had previously sought advice and who had helped us raise funds,\r\nhad urged me to institute action for false arrest. This I knew would be\r\na fruitless task, but I did consent to the demand for an investigation.\r\nCommissioner Enright was said to be out of the city, but Chief Inspector\r\nLahey, acting in his place, was to determine whether charges should be\r\npreferred against Captain Donohue for having stopped the meeting.\r\n\r\nOn December 2nd, in a small room closed to the press, Mr. Lahey sat at\r\nthe head of a long table. On his right was a chair to which I was\r\ncalled. On his left, opposite me, was a heavy man with a big bulldog\r\nhead, wearing a black alpaca coat. He fixed his eyes straight on mine as\r\nthough he intended to hypnotize me and influence by sheer terror what I\r\nwas to say. His features were so set, his expression so immobile, that I\r\nsensed animus. I refused to return his gaze but faced the Inspector\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThe interrogation, prompted by this sinister individual, who bent over\r\noccasionally to murmur into Mr. Lahey’s ear, held bitter malice.\r\nNevertheless, I answered every query as completely and as honestly as I\r\nwas able. I had nothing to hide, and still believed that my interlocutor\r\ncould arrive at no decision unless he heard the truth in its entirety. I\r\nwas all for telling it.\r\n\r\nBut never throughout any of the hearings could either the examiners or\r\npolice be kept to the point. They were not genuinely trying to find out\r\nwho had given the orders and why, but attempting to justify the illegal\r\nproceedings; and always they went off into vague irrelevancies\r\nextraneous to the issue, such as trying to embarrass dignified, elderly\r\nwitnesses by asking, “What are you doing with birth control?”\r\n\r\nChiefly the investigation focused around the Brownsville clinic raid. I\r\ndenied emphatically that certain contraceptives for use by men only had\r\never been there; they were of a type which I did not recommend, and had\r\nbeen brought in by the police themselves.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Sanger,” went on Mr. Lahey, “that this\r\nstatement of the police officer as written into the records was untrue?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lahey lifted an official finger to an attendant. The door of the\r\nanteroom opened and Mrs. Whitehurst, who had been the leader of the\r\nraid, was dramatically framed before us.\r\n\r\n“Do you say that if she,” he waved to her, “made the statement referred\r\nto in the police records, she lied?”\r\n\r\n“She did,” I affirmed. This was the first time in all my life that I had\r\never called a person a liar. I felt as though I had stepped down into\r\nthe lower brackets of common decency, but the police are accustomed to\r\nsuch words, and I had to meet the circumstances.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitehurst was instantly dismissed. I, too, was dismissed, and\r\nJuliet took my place. She had learned from her husband and other lawyers\r\nhow witnesses could protect themselves, and tossed off her answers\r\nreadily, now and then returning, “I don’t know,” and, frequently, “I\r\ndon’t remember.” The black-coated gentleman who had hoped to trip her up\r\nbut was getting nowhere, became exasperated and said roughly to Mr.\r\nLahey, “Oh, stop this! Ask her if she’s read the law.”\r\n\r\nJuliet admitted she had read Section 1142, but, to further questioning,\r\nreplied she did not recall when, she had not read it in my presence, she\r\nmight or might not have talked it over with me.\r\n\r\nMr. Lahey rose and left the room. Then the Unknown shouted to a young\r\nIrishman who had been busily taking notes, “Arrest that woman!”\r\n\r\nWe could not have been more astonished if a thunderbolt had struck the\r\nplace. For a few seconds, which seemed longer, everyone was paralyzed.\r\nAt last Mr. Marsh asked, “On what grounds is Mrs. Rublee arrested?”\r\n\r\n“She has violated Section 1142.”\r\n\r\n“She said she had read the law—is that a crime?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nMr. Marsh then inquired, “On whose authority is Mrs. Rublee arrested?”\r\n\r\nDead silence. No reply while the Unknown and the stenographer muttered\r\ntogether. Finally, when Mr. Marsh repeated the question, the latter\r\nreplied, “I do. I arrest her on my own authority. Patrolman Thomas J.\r\nMurphy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marsh said to the Unknown, “It’s customary for brothers of the law\r\nto give each other their names. Mine is Robert Marsh, practicing\r\nattorney. May I not know with whom I am speaking?”\r\n\r\n“I’m just a bystander.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Bystander, won’t you instruct the police officer to be more\r\nexplicit in his statement of facts?”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Marsh, I’m telling you the officer is arresting this witness\r\non his own initiative.”\r\n\r\nHe, too, left the room.\r\n\r\nJuliet, Mr. Marsh, and I entered her car and young\r\nStenographer-Patrolman Murphy, obviously ill at ease, sat beside the\r\nchauffeur. At the Elizabeth Street Court, Magistrate Peter A. Hatting\r\nsmiled cheerfully at us from behind his desk, “Well, where’s the\r\nprisoner?”\r\n\r\nMurphy made a feeble gesture in Juliet’s direction and said in a whisper\r\nwhich we could overhear, “It’s a birth control case.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see. Well, what was she selling—where are the articles?”\r\n\r\nMurphy could produce none.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, where is the evidence?”\r\n\r\nMurphy looked even more embarrassed, mumbled that he didn’t have any.\r\n\r\n“Well, the court is adjourned anyway, and we’ll have to wait until this\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\nI was turning my back on Murphy, very cross at him, but Juliet asked him\r\nto lunch with us. “He didn’t want to arrest me, did you, Mr. Murphy?”\r\nAnd Mr. Murphy shook his head most decidedly.\r\n\r\nWhile we ate, he explained that our Unknown was Assistant Corporation\r\nCounsel Martin W. Dolphin, with offices in the Police Department, that\r\nhe himself was Mr. Dolphin’s private secretary, that he had been brought\r\nto the inquiry merely to take dictation, that he had been only ten\r\nmonths on the force, that he had never arrested anybody before, and that\r\nwhen Mr. Dolphin had said to arrest Mrs. Rublee he had protested, “Why,\r\nI can’t arrest her. I haven’t seen her do anything to be arrested for!”\r\n\r\n“I’m awfully sorry,” he went on, addressing Juliet, “but I had to obey\r\norders. If I didn’t, I’d be in an awful mess. Gee, why didn’t they get\r\nsome of the old fellows down there to do it?”\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to court, Assistant District Attorney Wilson said to\r\nMagistrate Hatting, “Your Honor, I have no evidence in this case. The\r\npolice have furnished nothing to the District Attorney’s office. If I\r\nhave not sufficient evidence by three-thirty I’ll dismiss the whole\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nThen we waited. Eventually the expected “minutes and statement” arrived.\r\nMurphy swore that they were true—to Juliet’s wholehearted disgust. Her\r\nfaith in human nature had been betrayed; she did not see why he\r\npreferred to keep his job rather than his self-respect. Magistrate\r\nHatting seemed anxious to make everybody comfortable—Juliet, the\r\nCatholics, the police, and the public—and to convey the impression\r\nnobody was really to blame.\r\n\r\nSince the wife of a prominent lawyer had become involved, people in high\r\nplaces in New York had an obligation to protect their own. Publicity had\r\nbeen great before; now it was multiplied tenfold. A letter was addressed\r\nto Mayor Hylan:\r\n\r\n  The action of the Police Department ... constitutes such a wilful\r\n  violation of the right of free speech as to cause grave alarm to the\r\n  citizens of New York, who have a right to know why such outrages\r\n  have taken place, what motives and influences are behind them, and\r\n  whether any conspiracy exists in the Police Department to deny the\r\n  right of free speech and the equal protection of the law to citizens\r\n  of New York. This obviously is a matter of the gravest concern.\r\n\r\n  We, therefore, ask an immediate and full investigation to be\r\n  followed, if the evidence warrants, by such disciplinary measures\r\n  against the officials found to be guilty as will discourage similar\r\n  offenses hereafter.\r\n\r\nThis demand was signed by Henry Morgenthau, Sr., Herbert L. Satterlee,\r\nPaul D. Cravath, Lewis L. Delafield, Charles C. Burlingham, Samuel H.\r\nOrdway, Pierre Jay, Paul M. Warburg, Charles Strauss, Montgomery Hare.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Mayor Hylan delegated David F. Hirshfield, Commissioner of\r\nAccounts, to supervise an investigation into the previous investigation.\r\nThe first session was diverted into a discussion of the merits of birth\r\ncontrol. The Commissioner was facetious, and, when Mr. Marsh kept after\r\nhim for interrupting witnesses and getting off the subject, finally said\r\nhe had been insulted and refused to continue as long as Mr. Marsh\r\nrepresented us.\r\n\r\nAt the three subsequent hearings Emory R. Buckner took charge of our\r\ninterests. Dolphin, although summoned, did not appear at any of them.\r\nCaptain Donohue testified that Desk Lieutenant Joseph Courtney had\r\nreceived the information over the telephone, and had passed it on to\r\nhim. So far as he knew it was the telephone operator who had given the\r\norders to close the meeting. But he would, he said, have done so anyhow.\r\n\r\n“What law did Mrs. Sanger violate?” asked Mr. Buckner.\r\n\r\n“She was disorderly. I requested her several times to leave the platform\r\nand she defied me and said she would not do it. She caused quite a\r\ncommotion and people were all hollering and yelling, a general\r\ncommotion.”\r\n\r\n“You think it was a crime for her to commence to speak after a Captain\r\nof Police had told her not to?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was Miss Winsor also arrested because she attempted to speak after\r\nbeing told to keep quiet?”\r\n\r\n“She said she knew a woman who had nine children and the audience\r\ncommenced to holler and try to pull the policemen off the stage.”\r\n\r\nEven the Commissioner was becoming annoyed at Donohue’s inanities. He\r\nsaid to Mr. Buckner, “You do not have to put any witnesses on to show\r\nthe intelligence and the lack of sight or foresight of the Captain. You\r\nand I, I think, will agree on that point.” And then he turned to\r\nDonohue. “Now, Captain, will you tell me the reason for acting in the\r\nHall as you did to prevent that meeting? You see, I do not know whether\r\nyou understand me or not. You policemen, you do not usually understand\r\nordinary language. I want to know what was in your mind; why did you act\r\nas you did, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“Because I had orders to do so.” But he would not admit they came from\r\nany further back than the Desk Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nOfficer Murphy was put on the stand next, and the Commissioner gave him\r\na chance to explain what had prompted him to make the arrest. “I figured\r\nthis way. If it would be a crime to run such a meeting or hold such a\r\nmeeting in the City of New York according to the Penal Law, if Mrs.\r\nRublee was an assistant with Mrs. Sanger or anybody else in running such\r\na meeting, and there were distributed circulars regarding prevention of\r\nconception, Mrs. Rublee was just as much responsible for the\r\ndistribution of these circulars as anybody else.”\r\n\r\n“The circulars stated there would be a public mass meeting at Town Hall\r\non birth control,” said Mr. Buckner promptly. “Is that a crime?”\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner interrupted. “Mr. Buckner, you do not expect this young\r\nman to be interested in that. He is too young to know about birth\r\ncontrol. The old, bald-headed ones are the only ones that are interested\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\nAnd late in the afternoon he said, “I am too busy and have too much work\r\nto do, so we won’t have any summing up.”\r\n\r\nAt the concluding session Desk Lieutenant Courtney disclaimed all\r\nliability, saying the only order given to Captain Donohue was to take a\r\nnumber of policemen to the meeting and see that the law was not\r\nviolated; thereafter the Captain had acted on his own responsibility.\r\n\r\nAs far as I was concerned the final scene in the farce took place before\r\nthe elderly and firm Judge John W. Goff, one of the official referees of\r\nthe Supreme Court who was to hear the charges before the New York Bar\r\nAssociation as to whether Dolphin should be disbarred. He was summoned\r\nagain in vain until Judge Goff said angrily, “Unless he comes within the\r\nhour, I’ll subpoena him,” and at last, still in his alpaca coat, he put\r\nin an appearance. I was on the stand almost an entire afternoon during\r\nwhich the attorney representing Dolphin was attacking me personally\r\ninstead of inquiring into Juliet’s arrest.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Carlo Tresca?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know Alexander Berkman?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nI could now see what was coming; radicals were always made the whipping\r\nboys and, in lieu of specific charges, any acquaintance with them was\r\nmade to seem incriminating.\r\n\r\n“Do you know Emma Goldman?” Here the attorney’s voice rose in outrage,\r\nand he looked at Judge Goff as though to say, “There you have it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I reiterated, “but I also know Mrs. Andrew Carnegie and Mr. John\r\nD. Rockefeller, Jr. My social relations are with people of varying ideas\r\nand opinions.”\r\n\r\nThe next attempt was a subtle sort of third degree, aiming to confuse me\r\nand imply I was an inaccurate witness. “What was the precise time you\r\nentered the room where Mrs. Rublee was arrested? How large was it? How\r\nlong, how wide, how high, how many windows were there? Who was called\r\nfirst? Where were you sitting? How far was Inspector Lahey from your\r\nchair? Were you second, third, or fourth on the right side or left side?\r\nHow wide was the table, how long? Where was the door located relative to\r\nthe table?”\r\n\r\nUsually I could not have remembered one such immaterial and unnecessary\r\ndetail. But that afternoon I was given second sight. I could visualize\r\nthe room; my mind seemed to be projected into it so that every\r\nparticular stood out with the utmost clarity. It was an excellent lesson\r\nto me; thereafter I observed much more carefully.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of this cross-examination I was physically exhausted, as\r\nthough I had been flung back and forth, beaten and pounded from the\r\nbottom of my feet to the top of my head. I almost looked at my arms to\r\nsee whether they were black and blue, they ached so.\r\n\r\nIt was all useless. The police went unreprimanded, Donohue was promoted\r\nwhen things had quieted down, and Dolphin, though Judge Goff recommended\r\nprosecution and the Court of Appeals stated that his conduct was\r\n“arbitrary and unlawful,” was not disbarred because he had not been\r\nacting in an official capacity when he had ordered the arrest. In spite\r\nof the inconvenience, the humiliation of halls closed, covenants\r\nbroken—exactly nothing happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-five_\r\n\r\n                           ALIEN STARS ARISE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1921 I had signed a contract with the Kaizo group,\r\nwhich had arranged a series of lectures in Japan by four speakers:\r\nAlbert Einstein was to explain relativity, Bertrand Russell the\r\nconsequences of the Peace of Versailles, H. G. Wells his version of\r\ninternational accord, and I was to discuss population control,\r\ndelivering in March and April eight to ten lectures of five hours each.\r\nThe five-hour clause I innocently believed to be merely a mistake on the\r\npart of the translator, but I had faith in the common sense of human\r\nnature and expected the error to be taken care of when I arrived.\r\n\r\nJanuary and February were months of feverish activity. I spoke in city\r\nafter city—Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and elsewhere—rushing back\r\nto New York to Town Hall hearings and farewell luncheons and dinners.\r\nThe prolongation of the Town Hall episode had been entirely unforeseen.\r\nIf bookings had not already been made requiring my departure in\r\nFebruary, I should have postponed the trip. But I had promised, and\r\nlecture dates were binding obligations.\r\n\r\nStuart was at Peddie Institute where my brother Bob had gone, captain of\r\nhis football team, preparing for college, having a full and rich time.\r\nGrant was there also but he was barely thirteen; I could not bear to put\r\nthe broad Pacific between us. The headmaster warned me that he was only\r\nbeginning to adjust himself to the school and his studies, and would be\r\nset back at least a year if I took him with me. I agreed to reconsider,\r\nbut I am afraid I had made up my mind beforehand. With scant ceremony\r\nand scarcely enough clean shirts, I bundled him up and away, leaving the\r\nturbulence of New York behind.\r\n\r\nSince Grant was to travel on my passport, I had to have it renewed, and\r\nhad telegraphed Washington for it to be sent to the West Coast where the\r\ndetail of a visa could also be attended to. At San Francisco it was\r\nwaiting. With the little book and Grant in tow I presented myself to the\r\nJapanese Consul. Instead of stamping it as the usual mere formality, he\r\nexamined it carefully and then, apologizing profusely, regretted very\r\nmuch that the Japanese Imperial Government could not give me a visa.\r\n\r\nHere was a state of things. I asked him whether he could find out the\r\nprecise reasons. Was it that I as a person could not go there, or was my\r\nsubject taboo? The next day, after a cable to Tokyo and much polite\r\nbowing, he notified me it was both. In varying degrees of amusement and\r\nindignation the papers published the fact that the Japanese were turning\r\nthe tables on the United States; by our Exclusion Act we had implied\r\nthey were undesirable citizens, and now it was an American who was\r\nundesirable to them.\r\n\r\nThe steamship company would not sell me tickets on the _Taiyo Maru_\r\nwithout the visa. Two days previous to her sailing a Japanese who had\r\nbeen in the United States for the Washington Conference proffered a\r\nletter of introduction. He deplored the action of his Government and was\r\ndesirous of being helpful. “The _Taiyo Maru_ is going on to Shanghai.\r\nWhy don’t you get a Chinese visa?”\r\n\r\nI always chose to go forward, and there was always a chance that a way\r\nmight open. A hundred and fifty Japanese who had been at the\r\nconference—delegates, professors, doctors, members of the diplomatic\r\ncorps, secretaries—were returning by this same vessel. Once on board I\r\ncould meet them simply and informally, and I was sure I could convince\r\nthem I was not dangerous. The Chinese Consul granted a visa without\r\nquestion, our tickets were delivered, we sailed on the _Taiyo Maru_.\r\n\r\nI had never before been on a Japanese liner. The segregation between\r\nwhites and Orientals horrified me. Here were the aristocrats of a people\r\nby nature intelligent, well-bred, well-clothed, inclined to be friendly,\r\ntaking Grant under their wing, and teaching us both, amid much laughter,\r\nto eat with chopsticks. They had made valiant efforts to adapt\r\nthemselves to Occidentalism; they had altered their dress and fashion of\r\neating—substituting coats, collars, shoes for loose kimonos and soft\r\nfelt slippers, forks and knives for chopsticks; they sat on chairs\r\ninstead of kneeling comfortably on the floor. Yet my compatriots kept\r\nthemselves aloof. Never did I see the two groups together in\r\nconversation; they joined only in sports.\r\n\r\nAt night members of the crew wrestled in the moonlight, and I gazed down\r\nat their deck, marveling at the grips, the holds, the stoutness of legs,\r\nthe strength of backs and arms, the quickness of action, the primitive,\r\nguttural calls of the umpires. Others of the crew stamped their feet\r\nand, for good luck, threw pinches of salt towards their respective\r\nchampions.\r\n\r\nTwo days out the Japanese asked me to address them. I willingly\r\ncomplied, and the dining room was closed off for the purpose. Admiral\r\nBaron Kato, who was later to be Prime Minister, and headed the\r\ndelegation, talked to me afterwards. He had the culture, courtesy,\r\nrestraint, and suavity of a true gentleman, rather than the mien of the\r\nwar lord his title seemed to imply.\r\n\r\nEqually genial was Masanao Hanihara, then Vice Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs and destined to be Ambassador to the United States. He knew\r\nAmerican ways and manners, or mannerisms, if you wish to name them so;\r\nhe was understanding, and perhaps one of the most fluent of the Japanese\r\nI met in the ease of his English. He told me his people were not likely\r\nto accept the idea of birth control as a social philosophy, though they\r\nwere bound to accept the economic aspects, and all the young would be\r\ninterested as individuals.\r\n\r\nNot until later did I learn how happily my contact with these two\r\ngentlemen had resulted. They had separately cabled their Government\r\nasking that I be allowed to lecture in Japan.\r\n\r\nAt Honolulu I had one short afternoon into which to crowd so much. With\r\nleis hung about my neck I was whisked off for lunch to a magical house\r\nat Waikiki, then to a big meeting. What surprised and pleased me most\r\nwas the complete absence of race prejudice. I looked out over faces,\r\nmostly American but with a liberal sprinkling of Chinese and Japanese in\r\ntheir native costumes and Hawaiians in bright Mother Hubbards. Honolulu\r\nwas the only place I had found where, class for class, internationalism\r\ndid exist.\r\n\r\nTwo Japanese correspondents followed my zigzag trail, notebooks in hand,\r\npencils working furiously. They even inserted questions as I was swept\r\ntowards the boat where, breathless and almost in a daze, we were\r\ngarlanded once more. They had a scoop and were going to cable their\r\nfavorable impressions to their papers in Japan.\r\n\r\nTheir efforts had definitely produced a favorable reaction on board\r\nship. Individuals and delegations of Japanese came into my stateroom at\r\nany time—morning, afternoon, or evening—“to be informed.” Although they\r\ndid not knock, this was not considered an invasion of privacy, provided\r\nthey bowed profoundly on their way in; on entering and on leaving they\r\nbowed and bowed, again and again. They seemed to know more about my\r\naffairs and my children than I did myself, mentioning things I had\r\ncompletely forgotten, even reminding me of my unspoken thoughts of long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nPast experience had taught me that when a despotic and arbitrary screen\r\nwas interposed between birth control and the people, the desire for\r\nknowledge was immeasurably enhanced. This was particularly true in\r\nJapan, where the recent renaissance had quickened the public mind. At\r\nthe announcement I could not land, officialdom was subjected to frank\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nA little, round-faced boy called me each morning, murmuring something in\r\na voice so soft and melodious it almost lulled me back to sleep. With\r\nthe coffee, which tended to wake me, he announced, “Madam Sanger go in\r\nmaybe. Yes, Japanese Government let her go in.” In ten minutes he would\r\nreturn with the reversal of this news. He was aware of the contents of\r\nthe radiograms which kept the aerials crackling even before they had\r\nbeen delivered to me. One read, “Thousands disciples welcome you.”\r\nAnother, “Possible land Yokohama; impossible discourse.” From the ship’s\r\ndaily I learned first that I might lecture, but not publicly; and then,\r\na day later, after continuous derision on the part of the press—all\r\nright, I might talk publicly if I wished, but under no condition on\r\nbirth control. The last word I received was that I could land but speak\r\nonly in private. From the Ishimotos came the message, “Anticipate your\r\nstaying with us.”\r\n\r\nMarch 10th was so dripping and foggy that when we reached Tokyo Bay I\r\ncould not see Japan. The arrival of the _Taiyo Maru_ bearing such an\r\narray of distinguished passengers as the conference delegates was bound\r\nto call forth unusual activity. A veritable flotilla met the ship—police\r\nand health officers’ launches, mail tenders and press dispatch carriers.\r\nTwo officials came on board to interrogate me, and the three of us\r\nretired to my cabin, where our bags had been hopefully packed. I showed\r\nmy passport, told the purpose of my visit, explained how I happened to\r\nknow the Ishimotos and Mr. Yamanoto of the Kaizo group. Inspector and\r\ninterpreter alike smiled amiably as they plied their questions, ending\r\nwith the polite query, “Who is paying your expenses?” The implication\r\nwas that I might be a secret agent sent by the United States Government\r\nto deplete the population of Japan and to prepare the way for an\r\nAmerican invasion. This was particularly amusing, since I was one of the\r\npersons thoroughly disapproved of by my Government.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the lengthy catechism it was agreed that the ban would be\r\nremoved if I, for my part, agreed not to lecture publicly on birth\r\ncontrol, and provided the American Consul General Skidmore formally\r\nrequested permission for me to land. I had sent him a wireless message\r\nfrom the _Taiyo Maru_ saying I would like to visit the country, if not\r\nas a lecturer at least as a private citizen, and asking him to use his\r\ninfluence. Though I had had no reply I sent off a telegram to him\r\nimmediately, and Grant and I sat down on the luggage to await\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThe two officials had no sooner taken their departure than the little\r\ncabin was filled to bursting with the gentlemen of the press. We started\r\nand blinked with each rapid-fire, flashlight explosion. The room was\r\nliterally smoking with the acrid powder, and not an inch of standing\r\nroom remained. Seventy were all trying to get in at once; whatever I\r\nsaid had to be relayed and translated to the unsuccessful ones who\r\nbrimmed over into the corridor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we had docked at Yokohama and, when the reporters were\r\nfinally disposed of, my friends, who had been patiently enduring the\r\nrain, greeted me—Mr. Yamanoto, Mr. Wilson of the British Embassy,\r\nBaroness Ishimoto, and “the missionary who lived next door.” After\r\nwelcoming me they left, the last named carrying with him my briefcase\r\nladen with my most private papers and pamphlets, which I did not wish\r\nseized at the Customs.\r\n\r\nNow came the tapping of clogs along the passage, and in the doorway were\r\nframed slight, doll-like figures, pale white faces, crimson lips, black\r\nglossy hair beautifully coiffured, butterfly-looking obis. The trials of\r\nthe day vanished before their bobbing little bows. Here was a Japanese\r\nfairy tale come true.\r\n\r\nIn precise English the leader introduced the others; this one\r\nrepresented the silk manufacturers, that one the weavers; each of the\r\ntwenty-five was appearing for some laboring organization. She explained\r\nthey had been there all day, but it was nothing—they were so proud to be\r\nthe first to welcome the herald of freedom for women. The Industrial\r\nRevolution which had put them to work was still so young that they were\r\nin virtual slavery. Yet, she said, they were so accustomed to\r\nsubservience that it would be a long time until they learned to rebel\r\nagainst their wrongs. Suffrage was slow—Japanese women found it\r\ndifficult to see its advantages. They could not be stirred by offers of\r\neconomic independence; it was a higher ideal to have husbands take care\r\nof their wives than have them battle for themselves. She was certain no\r\ninspiration was to be found in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThen, with eyes sparkling, she added, “But when the message of birth\r\ncontrol came to us from Honolulu, like the lightning we understood its\r\nmeaning, and now we are all awakened.”\r\n\r\nWe were served with tea, and I continued to await a reply from Mr.\r\nSkidmore, but none ever came. Finally, at seven-thirty, due to the\r\nBritish Mr. Wilson’s intercession, the Imperial Government at last\r\nopened its gates to me without the sponsorship of my own Government.\r\n\r\nI still had to go through Customs. Papers and books, including forty\r\ncopies of _Family Limitation_, were confiscated. Thereafter I usually\r\nleft spaces in my diaries instead of writing out names, because I never\r\nknew who was going to see them.\r\n\r\nThe Customs men further minutely examined my clothes, accessories, even\r\nnecklaces and ornaments, holding them up, laughing at them, calling each\r\nother to come and look, in order to inform themselves as much on the\r\ncomposition and design as to determine whether they were dutiable. The\r\ndata they gleaned thus from incoming travelers they stored away like\r\nsquirrels—and cheaply-manufactured replicas shortly appeared on\r\nWoolworth counters, stamped in purple ink, “Made in Japan.”\r\n\r\nWhen I emerged, tired and damp, more crowds pressed around seeking\r\nautographs. Everywhere in Japan people wanted your signature. One man,\r\nwho spoke some English, said he represented the Ricksha-men’s Union and\r\napologized for the trouble to which I had been put. “Sometime Japanese\r\nGovernment he little autocratic.” For that matter everybody apologized\r\nfor the Government.\r\n\r\nAfter the torrents of rain, logs blazing in fireplaces warmed us in the\r\nIshimotos’ charming house at Tokyo. Grant and I were both in a large\r\nroom, almost bare of furnishings, exquisite in its simplicity. The\r\nfragile walls of painted silk gave an impression of airiness.\r\n\r\nNext to us was the huge bathroom, the floor and lower walls of\r\nburnished, shining copper. In the center, raised on legs, stood a great\r\nwooden tub with a top that closed down, and a hole for your neck. Five\r\nor six basins were ranged around the room and, beside each, brush and\r\nsoap. You were supposed to scrub and scrub and then rinse by throwing\r\npans of water over you. Finally you entered the steaming tub to relax.\r\nIt was not etiquette to leave any trace of soap in the bath or any\r\nevidence of its use, because everybody in the family soaked in that\r\nwater before the night was over—guests, hosts, and servants in order.\r\n\r\nI sank gratefully on one of the mattresses borrowed for our comfort and\r\nlaid on the floor; the rest of the household slept on mats with wooden\r\nblocks in place of pillows, a custom which allowed the ladies to keep\r\ntheir coiffures intact for a week at a time. Through the frail\r\npartitions we could hear the servants laughing and chatting until late\r\ninto the night, men and women together, carrying on their bathing as\r\nthough it were a function of eating.\r\n\r\nOur days were tremendously busy, beginning early with the ringing of the\r\nantiquated telephone on the wall. People came silently in rickshas and\r\ndeparted after conversing with the Baron and Baroness.\r\n\r\nOld Japan had extended esthetics into the realm of ordinary existence,\r\nand undoubtedly had produced a thing of beauty. The gestures of ceremony\r\nmight have meant little, but they made delightful the arranging of any\r\naffair whatever. The Japanese always greeted each other with a bow from\r\nthe waistline, hands gliding down to the knees. The difference between\r\none and another was so subtle that a foreigner could hardly distinguish\r\nit, but it was there all the same. A particular mark of respect was the\r\ntriple bow, graduated according to the social rank—an inclination, a\r\nslight pause, a deeper inclination, again a pause, and then down further\r\nuntil the back was nearly horizontal.\r\n\r\nGrant, who was very affectionate, had been accustomed to kiss me when we\r\nmet, whether it were in a restaurant, hotel, on the street, or anywhere\r\nelse for that matter. But he had to forego this salute in Japan when we\r\nobserved that kissing was a shock to Japanese sensibilities, and,\r\nindeed, was considered immoral. Instead, he took over Japanese manners\r\nand became marvelously courteous. Practically every time he spoke to me\r\nhe made the three bows, and unconsciously I soon found myself returning\r\nthem with equal formality.\r\n\r\nPoliteness in behavior, impersonal and ritualistic, was most noticeable\r\nin those relationships where we naturally expected habitual and\r\nconventional reserve to be thrown aside. When the Baroness Ishimoto’s\r\nmother and sister were coming for lunch, she donned a special kimono,\r\nset out special vases and screens, greeted them with the prescribed\r\nbows, wordings, and gestures. Even I noticed the civilities accorded the\r\ntwo were not the same. The effect was that the mother occupied the place\r\nof honor as though she were receiving.\r\n\r\nMen came also to the Ishimotos’ to plan for the various meetings and\r\nentertainments. A member of the House of Lords telephoned to say he was\r\na “disciple.” The press sought interviews. Early in my career I had\r\nrealized the importance of giving clear, concise, and true concepts of\r\nbirth control to those who wished to quote me. This simple policy served\r\nmy purpose particularly well in the Orient, where technical phrases in\r\nEnglish were hopelessly confusing. Under any circumstances our language\r\nwas peculiarly difficult for the Japanese, and their phraseology was\r\nsometimes convulsively funny. One letter from a dismissed government\r\nemployee to the head of his department was making the rounds of\r\nOccidentals in the East:\r\n\r\n  Kind Sir, on opening this epistle you will behold the work of a\r\n  dejobbed person, and a very be-wifed and much childrenized\r\n  gentleman, who was violently dejobbed in a twinkling by your\r\n  goodself. For Heaven’s sake, sir, consider this catastrophe as\r\n  falling on your own head, and remind yourself on walking home at the\r\n  moon’s end to savage wife and sixteen voracious children with your\r\n  pocket filled with non-existent pennies and pity my horrible state.\r\n  When being dejobbed and proceeding with a heart and intestines\r\n  filled with misery in this den of doom, myself did greedily\r\n  contemplate culpable homicide, but Him who protected Daniel (poet)\r\n  safe through the Lion’s den will protect his servant in this home of\r\n  evil. As to reason given by yourself esquire for my dejobment the\r\n  incrimination was laziness.\r\n\r\n  NO SIR. It were impossible that myself who has pitched sixteen\r\n  infant children into this vale of tears can have a lazy atom in his\r\n  mortal frame, and a sudden departure of eleven pounds has left me on\r\n  the verge of the abyss of destitution and despair.\r\n\r\n  I hope this vision of horror will enrich your dreams this night and\r\n  good Angel will meet and pulverize your heart of nether millstone so\r\n  that you will awaken and with such alacrity as may be compatible\r\n  with your personal safety, and will hasten to rejobulate your\r\n  servant.\r\n\r\n                                      So mote it be, Amen,\r\n                                            Yours despairfully,\r\n                                                          Akono Subusu\r\n\r\nAnd on the bottom of the letter the district officer had noted:\r\n\r\n                    Gentle Reader, do not sob—\r\n                    Akono Subusu has been rejobbed.\r\n\r\nI myself had a letter from a gentleman who wrote, “How I am unavoidably\r\nin need to execute your ‘Ism’ and hope to know your effective method.”\r\n\r\nHad it been allowed, I should have given forth practical information.\r\nSince it was not, I believed if I could make plain to the authorities\r\nthat I was not going to break this rule in my lectures, they could find\r\nno fault with them.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the morning of our second day in Tokyo an appointment was\r\nmade with the Police Governor. In spite of the early hour the hard\r\nlittle official, his close-cropped hair revealing all the bumps and\r\ndevelopments, served us tea. The Japanese always handed you tea as we\r\npass cigarettes—in embarrassment, for relaxation, or just to tie up\r\nloose moments. Disregarding the vital subject completely we discussed\r\ncurrent topics through an interpreter. Though all the people were\r\nintensely serious, they were remarkably fond of plays on words. Merrily\r\nI was told my name had created much confusion owing to its similarity to\r\n_sangai san_, which meant “destructive to production.”\r\n\r\nBirth control was thus delicately introduced. For the first time I heard\r\nabout the Dangerous Thought Law, which had been sponsored in Parliament\r\nby a group called the “Thought Controllers,” who aimed to exclude from\r\nthe country all ideas not conforming to ancient Japanese tradition. The\r\nPolice Governor assumed he knew exactly what I had planned to talk\r\nabout, and I could not move him from the conviction that I wanted to\r\npresent a Dangerous Thought.\r\n\r\nI was not, however, going to let the matter drop. I went higher up to\r\nthe Home Affairs Office. A courteous gentleman informed me the Minister\r\nsent his regards and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing me some other\r\ntime. There was no tea. I was politely bowed out.\r\n\r\nMy next stop was at the Kaizo office, where the entire staff was called\r\ninto consultation. They were bristly and burly enough to be taken for\r\nRussians; only their kimonos identified them as Japanese. One and all\r\ndecided we should go in person to the Imperial Diet. There, on\r\npresentation of our cards, couriers started running around to find the\r\nChief. In a few moments the door of the room into which we had been\r\nushered was opened, and in came the very same man with whom I had\r\nconversed at the Home Office that morning. Profoundly embarrassed I\r\nexplained this was the way of impatient Americans, who were bent on\r\nhurrying things along. He was very kind, and said he had been on the\r\npoint of giving me permission to speak publicly provided I did not\r\nmention birth control. When I sketched an outline of a possible\r\npopulation lecture we laughed and agreed the Empire of Japan was not, as\r\na result, going to fall.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the time of landing I had been deeply conscious that I was\r\nin one of the most thickly populated countries of the world. The\r\nIshimotos’ automobile honked, honked, at every turn of the wheels to\r\nsqueeze through rickshas, pedestrians, and children in the narrow,\r\nunpaved streets.\r\n\r\nIn any traffic danger the first concern was always for the baby. I never\r\nsaw one slapped, struck, scolded, or punished. I never heard one cry;\r\nthey all seemed happy and smiling, though I must admit a few of them\r\nneeded to have their little noses wiped. I could not believe any country\r\ncould contain so many babies. Fathers carried them in their arms;\r\nmothers carried them in a sort of shawl; children carried babies; even\r\nbabies carried smaller babies. I saw a land of one-story houses but of\r\ntwo-story children. Boys with babies on their backs were playing\r\nbaseball, running to bases, the heads of the babies wobbling so that you\r\nthought their necks were surely going to be broken.\r\n\r\nThe momentum that had come from the high birth rate was felt in every\r\nwalk of life. Peers, business and professional men were all having large\r\nfamilies. One told me he wanted twenty children. When I asked him how\r\nmany he had already he replied, “Two,” and he was offended when I\r\nsuggested that perhaps his wife, instead of himself, had had those.\r\n\r\nThe density of population in tillable areas of Japan averaged two\r\nthousand human beings to the square mile, and it was increasing at the\r\nrate of almost a million a year. Although they built terraced rice\r\npaddies on their hillsides with tremendous labor they could not feed\r\nthemselves. Furthermore, lacking ore, petroleum, and an adequate supply\r\nof coal, they could not develop their industries to a point where they\r\ncould exchange their products for enough food.\r\n\r\nThe Government should itself have been disseminating contraceptive\r\ninformation, but the army faction was not friendly to it and claimed\r\nJapan could never be respected in the eyes of the world until she\r\npossessed a force sufficiently powerful to make might right. It was even\r\nthen too late for birth control to offset the inevitability of her\r\noverflowing her borders; the population pressure was bound to cause an\r\nexplosion in spite of the safety valve of Korea. How long this could be\r\ndelayed was a matter of pure conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Twenty-six_\r\n\r\n                         THE EAST IS BLOSSOMING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I found out where I stood with the Government, the silent friends\r\nwho had come and gone so frequently from the Ishimoto home produced\r\nplans for various meetings. In each one the address was to a particular\r\nclass which did not mingle with others—commercial, educational, medical,\r\nparliamentary.\r\n\r\nThe Kaizo group were intensely disappointed that I could not deliver the\r\nlectures I had prepared and for which they had invited me to Japan. As a\r\ncompromise we agreed that I should have to focus my War and Population\r\ntalk around Germany and the Allies. It was going to be difficult,\r\nbecause I was not satisfied with the European facts and figures I had.\r\n\r\nMy first meeting was at the Tokyo Y.M.C.A. Shortly before one o’clock I\r\nwas escorted with great ceremony into a room behind the auditorium,\r\npungent with smoke from a charcoal stove. Then I was presented to a\r\ngathering of about five hundred—prosperous-looking men, well-dressed\r\nwomen, students, a number of foreigners, a Buddhist priest or two, and a\r\nliberal sprinkling of the Metropolitan Police to make certain my\r\naudience thought no dangerous thoughts as a result of my speech.\r\n\r\nMost of the auditors apparently understood some English, because while I\r\nwas speaking they leaned forward attentively, laughing in the proper\r\nplaces, but when I paused for the translation they relaxed, rustled\r\npapers, and whispered to each other.\r\n\r\nI had discovered that the five-hour clause in my contract was no mistake\r\nand no joke. Standing from one until six was a frightful strain. The\r\nlecture with interpretations took three hours, although I could have\r\ndelivered it in one, and questions took two more. Many of these were on\r\nsubjects entirely alien to my own. “What do you think of missionaries?\r\nWhat do you think of Christianity? Are you yourself a Christian?” This\r\nlast was naïvely posed, and, thoroughly aware of the significance of\r\nwhat it meant truly to be a Christian, I replied, “I’m afraid I’m not a\r\nvery good one.”\r\n\r\nMy questioner put out his chest and said confidently, “I am.”\r\n\r\nI seemed to recall my adolescence when I had exacted the last ounce of\r\nrighteousness from every breathing hour. Many of the Japanese converts\r\nhad this spirit. They were trying to change their ancestral ideas of\r\nmorality and, instead, adopt wholesale the Christian code without having\r\nhad time to assimilate it.\r\n\r\nThe most painful experience I had in Japan was in addressing the Tokyo\r\nmedical association. The volunteer interpreter was a young doctor who\r\nhad been on a three weeks’ tour of America, and his command of English\r\nwas correspondingly slight. From the attitude of the audience I could\r\ntell whenever he was not conveying my meaning as I had intended it,\r\nthough I did not always know what specifically was wrong. The Baroness,\r\nunable to bear his mis-translation of “prevention of conception” as\r\nabortion, which she knew would distress me intensely, finally rose and\r\nattempted to correct the erroneous impression he was giving. But the\r\nmeeting was over before she could make it clear.\r\n\r\nNothing had been said about remuneration. I expected none. But the next\r\nday an army of ten rickshas appeared. The officers of the society, laden\r\nwith packages and bundles, presented themselves. One by one they offered\r\nboxes in which I found an elaborate kimono, an embroidered table cover,\r\na purse, a fan, a cloisonné jar, and, in conclusion, the President\r\noffered me the smallest package of all, wrapped in tissue and tied with\r\na paper tape on which were the characters wishing me health, happiness,\r\nand longevity. Opening it I found crisp new bills in payment. This\r\ndelicate gesture was typically Japanese.\r\n\r\nAt other meetings we usually sat on clean, fresh mats; the room might be\r\nchilly, but a little charcoal burner was beside you and occasionally you\r\nwarmed your hands over it. I liked the service and the food which the\r\nmaids silently brought all at once on a tray, covered over and steaming\r\nhot. After _saké_ in diminutive porcelain cups the group was ready to\r\nconverse, and it was cozy and interesting. Often we did not get away\r\nuntil midnight because, although the discussion was carried on in\r\nEnglish, each remark was translated for the benefit of those who did not\r\nunderstand. The Baroness always went with me, and it was a revelation to\r\nthem to have one of their own countrywomen present.\r\n\r\nI had heard much talk of the Elder Statesmen, but nobody at the Peers’\r\nClub, where I gave an afternoon address, seemed to be even elderly. They\r\nwere curious to know why women were divorced, whether they wanted more\r\nthan one husband, whether they really could ever care for more than one\r\nman, the nature of their love for children, how long it could continue.\r\nThey were like Europeans in the frankness with which they regarded the\r\nrelationship of the sexes. Yet they were not satisfied with the accepted\r\nJapanese tradition—on the one hand geisha girls who played and coquetted\r\nand amused them, and on the other wives whose place as yet was\r\ndefinitely in the home. They asked, “Is it not true that the American\r\nwoman can be all things to her husband—his companion, mother of his\r\nchildren, mistress, business manager, and friend?”\r\n\r\nI agreed with them that this was the ideal, but had to confess that by\r\nno means every American wife fitted into this picture.\r\n\r\nMany of the Japanese had themselves forgotten that in the heroic and\r\nepic days women had enjoyed freedom and equality with men. Only with the\r\nrise of the powerful military lords in the Eighth Century had this most\r\nrigid, most persistent, and most immovable discrimination arisen.\r\n\r\nThe _Ona Daigaku_, the feudal moral code, counseled:\r\n\r\n  A woman shall get up early in the morning and go to bed late in the\r\n  evening. She must never take a nap in the daytime. She shall be\r\n  industrious at sewing, weaving, spinning, and embroidery. She shall\r\n  not take much tea or wine. She shall not visit places of amusement,\r\n  such as theaters or musicals. She must never get angry—she must bear\r\n  everything and always be careful and timid.\r\n\r\nThe resultant upper-class Japanese lady, exquisite and decorative, was a\r\nliving work of art particularly created by the imagination of numberless\r\ngenerations of men. My original conception of all Japanese women had\r\nbeen fashioned out of romantic fallacies—partly by the three little\r\nmaids from school who simpered through the _Mikado_, and to no small\r\nextent by the gaudy theatricalism of _Madama Butterfly_. The\r\nunrestrained exoticism of Pierre Loti and Lafcadio Hearn had\r\nstrengthened my illusions, as had also the color prints that had aroused\r\nso much enthusiasm towards the end of the century.\r\n\r\nBut I soon found the cherry blossom fairyland was being destroyed by the\r\nadvent of machinery. In Yokohama and Kobe you heard factory whistles and\r\nsaw tall smokestacks, new shipyards, and great steel cranes. The\r\nIndustrial Revolution, accomplished in our Western countries gradually,\r\nhad invaded the Island Empire with an impact and a shock the\r\nrepercussions of which were still evident. It had not brought freedom to\r\nthe women whose low status was admirably suited to the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing with its ever-increasing demand for cheap and unskilled\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nPractically half the female population, some thirteen millions, were\r\nengaged in gainful occupation though few were economically independent.\r\nIn the mill districts mothers scolded their small daughters by\r\nthreatening, “I’ll sell you to the weavers.” These _kaiko_, or “bought\r\nones,” served as apprentices generally from three to five years. Modern\r\nJapanese industrialism had been able to take advantage of an ancient\r\nOriental habit of thought which placed slight value on the girl child.\r\n\r\nI spent half a day as the guest of the Kanegafuchi plant, the largest\r\ncotton mill in the Empire and the ideal industrial institution which was\r\nto be a model for others, comparing favorably with one of our best. But\r\nKanegafuchi was the exception. On the average, employees in other mills\r\nworked a twelve-hour shift, day and night, amid the deafening roar of\r\nrelentless power engines. Dust and fine particles of fabric fell like\r\nminute snowflakes upon them. Their growth was stunted, their resistance\r\nto infection and malignant disease broken down. In a silk-spinning mill\r\nat Nagoya conditions were only slightly better. I found over seven\r\nhundred girls, some no more than ten years of age, swiftly twirling off\r\nthe slender threads from the cocoons and catching them on the spindles.\r\nThey were pathetic, gentle, homeless little things, imprisoned in rooms\r\nwith all windows closed to keep them moist and hot. A quarter of their\r\nseven dollars a month wages had to go for board.\r\n\r\nOnly by the graciousness and charity, in a sense, of the upper classes\r\nwere the household servants saved from institutions. When the Baroness,\r\nfor example, had married, some of them—cooks, maids, and nurses—had\r\nstayed with her parents, some had gone to another sister, some had come\r\nto her and been set to training the new ones. With her they had a home\r\nfor life. This system accounted in part, at least, for the fact there\r\nwere no beggars or mendicants in Japan.\r\n\r\nEssentially conservative, essentially the product of a strange and\r\nscarcely understood past, the Japanese woman in my opinion did not\r\npossess in her typical psychology any strong leanings towards rebellion.\r\nThis was true even among the many women writers on papers and magazines.\r\nThose who interviewed me were intelligent, but I was constantly amazed\r\nat their ancient and domesticated outlook.\r\n\r\nI did not believe the woman of Japan would discard her beautiful costume\r\nor sacrifice her esthetic sense upon the altar of Occidental progress\r\nand materialism. The kimono was her chrysalis. Outwardly it was often of\r\nsome thick serviceable goods, dull brown or black, shot through with\r\nthreads of purple or blue. Yet underneath were silks of the brightest\r\nand most flaming hues, formalized for each particular occasion. Only a\r\nfleeting glimpse was caught of these as she walked. They were symbolic\r\nof her present position in society.\r\n\r\nFrom the lowest serving maid to the finest aristocrat, certain indelible\r\ntraits immediately impressed themselves. First of all was the low, soft,\r\nfluttering voice, like art and music combined. They were too modestly\r\nshy to talk out loud; you could scarcely hear them in a small room.\r\nPerhaps one reason men did not take their opinions seriously was because\r\nthey did not speak up. I heard on every side of the New Woman—but I\r\nnever saw her. Only those who had turned Christian showed any signs of\r\nthinking independently. To be a Christian seemed to imply being a rebel\r\nor radical of some kind. They told me it with great secret pride.\r\n\r\nThis was the single place where I had found men rather than women\r\nresponding to the potentialities of birth control. The former wanted to\r\nlearn and thereby make of themselves something better. They were more\r\nand more in touch with the ideas of the Western world, and were\r\nbroadening themselves through travel. I was confident a shifting\r\nenvironment was going to extend the masculine point of view and, if\r\nbirth control could be proved of benefit to them, they would practice\r\nit. At that time I did not agree that East and West could never meet.\r\n\r\nJapan was undoubtedly a man’s country. Wherever we went, Grant was\r\nExhibit A. He was a tall, dark, rather gawky youth, with adolescent\r\nmanners but always cheerful. In private houses butlers and maids paid\r\nhim much attention, and, in hotels, as soon as we entered the dining\r\nroom everybody, because he was a man child, rushed to anticipate his\r\nwishes, to see that he was made comfortable. I straggled on behind. At\r\nour first appearance in one of these, the little girls who were being\r\ntrained as waitresses and whose duty it was to bow the guests in and out\r\nwere obviously confused. When we were seated at the table the proprietor\r\napologized, “You must excuse them because they are so young, and they\r\nhave their minds too much on this young gentleman.”\r\n\r\nThe Yoshiwara, to which some missionaries escorted me, was certainly an\r\nintegral part of this man’s world. First we visited the unlicensed\r\nquarter, winding in our rickshas among alley-like streets lined with\r\nsmall houses. The dark eyes of the girls peered out through slits in the\r\nscreen walls. Working men were standing in the muddy roadways,\r\nchattering, scrutinizing the prices which were posted in front like\r\nrestaurant menus—so much per hour, so much per night. A door opened to\r\nadmit a visitor. The light in the lower story vanished and soon another\r\ntwinkled upstairs; or a light went out above and reappeared below, the\r\ndoor opened again and a figure emerged. Hundreds of lights behind paper\r\nwindows seemed to flicker on and off constantly, low to high, high to\r\nlow. The sordidness, the innumerable, shining eyes made me shiver\r\ninvoluntarily.\r\n\r\nAfter we crossed a bridge to the licensed quarter the scene changed\r\nimmediately. The wide thoroughfare, with a row of trees down the center\r\nfestooned with electric globes like a midway, was clean and inviting.\r\nThe amply-built houses had an air of spaciousness and luxury, their\r\nlanterns sent out a soft, alluring gleam, and carefully cultivated\r\ngardens produced a profusion of flowers in the courtyards. This part of\r\nthe Yoshiwara appeared a delightful place. Its attraction for the girls\r\nwas obvious; they would rather seek a livelihood in this fashion than in\r\nthe dismal factories. Nor was it odd that they should find more romance\r\nhere with many men than drudging for one all their days as the\r\n“incompetents” they became after marriage under the domination of their\r\nmothers-in-law.\r\n\r\nThrough portals as broad as driveways the patrons, much better dressed\r\nthan those in the unlicensed quarter, strolled up to view the\r\nphotographs of the inmates, posted like those in the lobby of a Broadway\r\ntheater. In some frames was only the announcement, “—— just arrived,\r\nstraight from ——. No time for picture.” The clients did a great deal of\r\n“window shopping.” Newcomers from the country might have eight or nine\r\nvisitors an evening, an older one but two or three. Many of the girls\r\ncame from good families, frequently to lift their fathers or brothers\r\nout of debt. They sent their earnings back and, as soon as they had\r\naccumulated a sufficiency, often went home, married, and became\r\nreputable members of society.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the Yoshiwara’s artificial glamour, the crowd of men\r\nswarming like insects, automatically reacting to the stimulus of\r\ninstinct, was unutterably depressing.\r\n\r\nWe walked home at midnight through the sleeping city, mysterious and\r\nquiet, not like a city at all—no jumping signs or illumination, but more\r\nlike a nice, low-ceilinged room trimmed with old, brown-stained oak, and\r\nonly here and there a glow.\r\n\r\nNothing else in my travels could compare with that month in Tokyo. The\r\nlanguage was strange and unfamiliar. The bells in the shafts of the\r\nrickshas, ringing for pedestrians to get out of the way, added a bizarre\r\nnote. The queer, clicking sound of the wooden geta was different\r\nalthough somewhat reminiscent of the clop, clop, of the Lancashire\r\nwooden shoes, which also were taken off at the door and exchanged for\r\nslippers. All the smells and the sights were quite new, even the signs\r\non the shops were unreadable. In Europe, you could usually guess from\r\nsome root word what kind of merchandise was for sale within. But not so\r\nin Japan. One day I stopped, totally puzzled, to inquire the whereabouts\r\nof a store the address of which had been written down for me. I showed\r\nmy slip of paper but nobody there could help me. I went on. Fully three\r\nminutes later the pattering of hurried steps behind me caused me to\r\nturn. Here was one of the clerks. He had gone to the trouble of looking\r\nup the address I had asked for and had come to act as guide to make sure\r\nI arrived.\r\n\r\nThroughout Japan the custom of greeting you and seeing you off was\r\ntouching, and gave you a charming remembrance of a world where\r\nfriendships were worth time and consideration. When a Tokyo doctor heard\r\nI was leaving Yokohama eighteen miles away at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning, he presented himself at seven to bring me a box of choice silk\r\nhandkerchiefs. He must have risen at five to do so.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of the train for Kyoto the faces of the old men trudging\r\nalong the road looked curiously like the drawings of them. Everywhere\r\nwere small village houses and, since I could see through from front to\r\nrear, I wondered where the peasants and their numerous offspring ate and\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nThe former capital was fascinating. The shopkeepers appeared to esteem\r\ntheir visitors more highly than the goods they had to sell, though Kyoto\r\nblue and, more especially, Kyoto red were like no other colors anywhere.\r\nIf ever you see the latter, buy it if you can, cherish it among your\r\ntreasures, save it for your children, because it is the most beautiful\r\nof all reds.\r\n\r\nIt was now April, the festival of spring and of the geishas, the\r\njealously guarded and chaperoned entertainers, singers, players.\r\nEverybody was anticipating the flowering of the cherry trees, and with\r\nthe rest of Kyoto I went to see the enormous, spreading, willow cherry,\r\nthen in dazzling white blossom. It was several hundred years old, its\r\nlimbs which grew out and drooped towards the ground were propped up with\r\ncare, and around it was a superbly groomed landscape garden. The\r\nproprietors of hotels near such trees erected unpretentious tea houses,\r\ntemporary in character, where hundreds of people kept vigil. You could\r\nnot help having respect for a people whose love of a tree brought them\r\nfrom miles away and who waited day and night throughout the duration of\r\nits brief blooming. They paid deference to it as they did to a great\r\nartist who they knew could live just so long.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese designed their gardens with the mood of the individual in\r\nmind. Some were filled with music, water, birds, activity, and there you\r\ncould go to be cheered when gloomy and despondent. As soon as I entered\r\nthe Golden Temple grounds its influence fell upon me. Everything was\r\nplanned for thought and concentration. No color, no noise, no rushing of\r\nwater, no singing birds distracted the attention. Only at certain hours\r\ncould you even walk about, because movement was disturbing to\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nJapanese hospitality reached its finest flower in Kyoto, and the supreme\r\nday of entertainment was offered by a generous and considerate doctor.\r\nOn inviting me to luncheon he said he would call with his car at ten in\r\nthe morning. This seemed a bit early, but it appeared he wanted me first\r\nto visit the Museum of Art. Here was no wandering through miles of rooms\r\nso that the eye was wearied and no lasting impression was gathered.\r\nInstead, I was shown only the one most prized specimen of paintings,\r\nporcelains, and rare screens. Afterwards, I was ushered into the library\r\nto see a collection of precious manuscripts, then back through the city\r\nfor a few especially renowned views, and finally at noon to the doctor’s\r\nhome. His wife and two daughters greeted me and I was introduced to the\r\nguests. Little short-legged trays were put before our floor cushions,\r\nand we all picked up our chopsticks. I envied Grant his dexterity.\r\n\r\nAfter the trays had been removed, we conversed until the business men\r\nhad to return to their offices. But a fresh group of guests took their\r\nplaces, and with them appeared a painter. An easel was set up and each\r\nof us in turn made a single brush line on the rice paper—some straight,\r\nsome curved, some vertical, some horizontal, crisscrossing each other in\r\nevery direction. Then the artist took his brush and, amid exclamations\r\nof wonder and appreciation, with a few expert strokes converted the\r\nmélange into a flower pattern, a lake, or a mountain.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so of this pleasure and the easel was swished away, the\r\npainter vanished with his colors, and a sculptor was substituted. We\r\nwere now supplied with dabs of clay which we began to mold, the sculptor\r\ngoing from one to another to give assistance. If you were clever, as\r\nseveral of the Japanese were, works of art resulted. I created a plain\r\njug with handle and lip, was taught how to draw a design upon it and how\r\nto paint it. Next day it was delivered to me, baked and glazed.\r\n\r\nLater we were escorted to the garden where we congregated beneath an\r\nopen tea house perched high on a rock. There the younger daughter tended\r\na tiny fire and brewed a ceremonial tea—no simple brew, but leaves of a\r\nspecial sort, beaten until the beverage was bright green. When we had\r\nenjoyed this delight we strolled about, admiring the brooklets, the\r\ndwarf pines, the shrubs, the iris in bloom.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the house to find, as though in a play, that the scenery\r\nhad all been changed. Different screens were up, fresh flowers in the\r\nvases, the women of the household in more elaborate costumes, and new\r\nvisitors waiting. Grant and I alone seemed to remain static.\r\n\r\nNow on the immaculate matted floor appeared little charcoal stoves. The\r\nevening meal was served by the mother and daughters as a marked honor to\r\ntheir guests. This time I was brought a spoon and fork; apparently I had\r\nnot been very deft at lunch in handling my chopsticks. After dinner came\r\nyet more people and yet more conversation. I had been talking steadily\r\nsince early morning, the topic being selected according to the type of\r\ngathering. In the evening it was population, and more serious. Sometimes\r\nI forgot myself and spun out involved English phrases, then, realizing\r\nthey had missed fire, had to go back and choose key words more easily\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nThis continued until midnight or later. At last we had to excuse\r\nourselves and ask to be taken home, because we were leaving for Kobe the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and his wife, accompanied by some of their friends, were at\r\nour hotel betimes, all with boxes and bon voyages. This reversal of the\r\nOccidental custom of bestowing presents on one’s host or hostess was an\r\nenchanting way of conducting the amenities of life. They wanted no\r\nreturn for their hospitality. I had arrived in Japan with one small\r\ntrunk and departed with five, laden with gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-seven_\r\n\r\n                         ANCIENTS OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nNew and different places, strange countries, peoples, and faces have\r\nalways appealed to me. I did not have to be in London for the Fifth\r\nInternational Conference until July. When I had secured my Chinese visa\r\nit had occurred to me that it might be much better to go on around the\r\nworld than retrace my steps.\r\n\r\nOn a misty day, the sun not bright enough to clear the sky completely,\r\nwe sailed from Kobe through the glorious Inland Sea, threaded its\r\ninnumerable islets, like the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence, only\r\nmore delicate. The boat was small and out-of-date. A few of the English\r\nhad chairs but Grant and I wandered between crates of ducks, chickens,\r\nand livestock, and hundreds of Japanese squatting stolidly on the deck.\r\nWhen we emerged into the Yellow Sea it became very foggy and Grant was\r\nsick to his toes. I put on a brave face and ate, though with long teeth,\r\nas the old phrase goes.\r\n\r\nWe landed at Fusan one evening. Koreans stood about in their white robes\r\nwhich fell to their ankles, pale figures outlined against the night in\r\nthe subdued light of their mysterious paper lanterns. The next morning\r\nas I glanced out over the countryside on the way to Seoul it appeared an\r\nOriental desert, odd but seemingly familiar. I felt at home within its\r\ngates. White-robed coolies smoking long thin pipes with minute bowls\r\ndrove oxen, worked in the fields. They had North American Indian faces,\r\nuncut, ragged hair, reddish skins, and curious, wooden structures\r\nstrapped to their backs to carry burdens of any kind—soil, coal, rocks.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Seoul were broad, dimly lit. The tall Korean men were\r\nunique, a combination of priest, patriarch, and grandee, so formal and\r\nelegant with their pointed beards a trifle larger than Van Dykes. They\r\nwere utterly indifferent to other people, managing to preserve a proud\r\nand aloof air in spite of their idiotic, silly-looking hats,\r\ndinky-crowned and wide-brimmed, from which hung strings of amber beads,\r\nvaluable family heirlooms.\r\n\r\nI wondered again at the universal white costumes. Everywhere on the\r\nbanks of rivers women were eternally pounding laundry; you could almost\r\nfeel the threads parting company with the terrific beating—washing with\r\nstones and ironing with sticks.\r\n\r\nThe Korean was held in contempt by the Japanese, who declared his\r\nGovernment had built schools, roads, railroads, brought cleanliness. It\r\nwas true that the houses of the Koreans were not so well-kept, their\r\nhabits not so sanitary, but they were a separate race, and they accepted\r\nscouring and scrubbing and sweeping only under pressure. Hatred and\r\nrebellion had been the result of denying them their language and\r\ncustoms. They claimed they were taxed out of existence to pay for such\r\nluxuries, and nourished antagonism and stubborn resistance against\r\nanything Japanese. They maintained further that they had no personal\r\nliberty, even being required to have passports to move about in their\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nKoreans also resented the speeding up of production in the silk\r\nfactories through the exploitation of little girls. I saw them there,\r\nshoulders bent, crouched up over their work, hair braided down their\r\nbacks; they were almost like babies. Their job was to put their tender,\r\ndelicate fingers into boiling water to pull out the silk cocoons—the\r\nhands of older people were not sensitive enough. But the Japanese said\r\nthey did not feel the pain.\r\n\r\nEven though I had a large luncheon meeting attended by foreign\r\nmissionaries and officials, Korea was but a stepping stone to China. The\r\nCelestial Kingdom had an indefinable odor of its own, peculiar and\r\ninimitable, which waxed and waned, varying with each city and with each\r\ndistrict of a city. It might be a compound of sauces, onions, garlic,\r\nincense, opium, and charcoal, but who has ever succeeded in putting an\r\nodor into words? It marched upon you, at first faintly and indistinctly\r\nlike a distant army, and then closed in relentlessly, associating itself\r\nwith memories, making you gasp in protest or pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt Peking I wanted to change into fresh clothes all the time. I was\r\nhaunted by dust—dust in my body, in my ears, up my nose, down my throat,\r\nbetween my teeth. Some of the streets were paved, but the dust was\r\nsuffocating. After every sight-seeing sortie I bathed and bathed and\r\nbathed in a desperate effort to rid myself of the diabolical dust.\r\n\r\nWe were seven days viewing palaces, native quarters, night life,\r\nsing-song girls, hospitals, factories, silk mills. We heard the\r\nmechanical chanting and beating of drums by Buddhist priests, mostly\r\nyoung boys dressed in soiled yellow robes; gazed with amazement at the\r\nfuneral processions—great floats, fantastic gods, food, flowers,\r\npossessions; visited old Chinese gardens and museums. I shopped for jade\r\nand lapis lazuli and was well cheated.\r\n\r\nBeggars, many of them crippled and on crutches, were hobbling along in\r\nthe gutters or sitting on corners, gaunt and filthy. Children were\r\nturning handsprings, doing anything to attract your attention; they\r\nedged beside you, and you had the feeling they had been born with palms\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nYou could not set foot out of doors without being besieged by ricksha\r\nboys clothed only in scant, cotton trousers and jackets, always short at\r\nankles and wrists. The moment you stepped in they picked up the shafts\r\nof their little vehicles and began the dogtrot journey. I could not\r\nbecome accustomed to the eager running of these half-naked creatures, so\r\nweak, so underfed, so much less able than the rest of us. It had been\r\nbad enough in Japan, but there you felt the runners were sturdy; in\r\nChina they usually were suffering from varicose veins, heart disease,\r\nand, forever, hunger. Often, as the wind blew some of the rags and\r\ntatters aside, I saw pock marks and wondered how close we were to the\r\nmanifold diseases of the Orient.\r\n\r\nI was going about a good deal and it worried me to be pulled around by a\r\nhuman being so emaciated. One morning our regular boy was missing.\r\nAnother replaced him, cheery and smiling. Three days later the first\r\nreturned. He had been sick, he said; he had had smallpox. The scabs had\r\nnot yet peeled off.\r\n\r\nI spoke to the doorman at the hotel, who managed the rickshas. “This boy\r\nis not well enough to work.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, he’s used to it. He feels a little bad, but he’s all right.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I sent him home to rest up. Nothing save famine and\r\npestilence and plague seemed to give the Chinese any breathing spell. It\r\nwas said the average ricksha coolie lasted but four or five years—the\r\nremainder of his life he merely subsisted. I was submerged in a strange\r\ndespondency and questioned “the oldest civilization in the world” which\r\nstill, after so many thousand years, permitted this barbarism.\r\n\r\nGrant rode a donkey when we went to the Ming tombs, and the guide did\r\nalso. I was carried in a chair for miles and miles through an arid,\r\ndusty plain. Two coolies held the lengthy bamboo poles on their\r\nshoulders and a third jogged alongside waiting to take his turn. I felt\r\nso sorry for them I wanted to get out and walk. I wished I could carry\r\nmyself. All the way these poor, starved creatures made animal noises,\r\n“Aah-huh, aah-huh,” nasal, interminable, varying the tone but slightly;\r\neven their words sounded like grunts to me.\r\n\r\nChina was not yet past the story-telling age, as you saw in the theater,\r\nwhere someone recited the news from the stage; for a copper anybody\r\ncould hear what was going on in the world. The ancient classical forms\r\nof the Chinese language were intelligible to scholars alone, and Dr.\r\nHu-Shih had been instrumental in devising a literary vernacular which\r\nthe people could use. This philosopher who at three years old had been\r\nfamiliar with eight hundred characters, now in 1922, while only in his\r\nlate twenties, was already reputed to be the initiator of the Chinese\r\nRenaissance. He asked whether I would speak to the students of the\r\nPeking National University and, though he was to act as chairman,\r\nvolunteered also to interpret, which I esteemed an almost unheard-of\r\nhonor. His outlook, coinciding with mine, recognized what birth control\r\nmight mean for civilization.\r\n\r\nDr. Tsai Yuen-Pei, the Chancellor of the University and a leader of the\r\nanti-Christian movement, had gathered into his fold the most brilliant\r\nstudents of Young China, all of them bubbling over with interest at\r\nWestern ideas, which were sweeping the globe. A great turmoil was going\r\non in their lives and a revolt against rigid Chinese tradition.\r\n\r\nDue to the translation difficulties I had encountered in Japan, I had\r\ndecided I could not afford to speak in China unless I went over the\r\nsubject first with my interpreter and knew he understood the spirit as\r\nwell as the words. Therefore I showed Dr. Hu-Shih my lecture material in\r\nadvance. He suggested, “These students will want to know everything\r\nabout contraception as it is practiced.”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve never given that except at medical meetings.”\r\n\r\n“China is different from the West. Here you may discuss contraception as\r\nan educational fact as well as a social measure. You will be listened to\r\nrespectfully, laughed at if you do not, and will surely be asked for\r\ndefinite information. I think you should prepare yourself for this.”\r\n\r\nIt was not simple to digress from principles and theories and go into\r\nmethods that needed diagrams and technical knowledge to secure\r\nunderstanding, and I felt diffident about following his advice. But\r\nthese young people, responsive and alert, received my first practical\r\nlecture with earnest attention. Dr. Hu-Shih translated accurately and\r\nquickly, interjecting amusing stories and improving, I imagine, upon my\r\nown words.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he and I were escorted across the campus to the home of Dr.\r\nTsai. I have always been interested in foreign foods. I like to try them\r\nout, and have brought home dozens of Hawaiian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese\r\nrecipes which can be made at home. This dinner was an Arabian Nights\r\nexperience. It began at seven and lasted until one in the\r\nmorning—bird’s-nest and quail egg soup, fried garoupa, ducks’ tongues\r\nand snow fungus, roast pheasant, rice and congee, lotus nuts and pastry,\r\nsharks’ fins, and various kinds of wine.\r\n\r\nThere must have been well over thirty guests invited for the evening,\r\namong them an American woman, Mrs. Grover Clark, whose husband was on\r\nthe faculty of the University. Some of the students had been to her\r\nbetween the lecture and dinner time and given her the transcribed notes\r\nwhich they had taken down in shorthand. Would she correct them? They\r\nwanted to get the information published. When they came to the\r\nChancellor’s home to call for them so that they could deliver them to\r\nthe press, I could see at a glance that this was not at all what I\r\ndesired to leave behind me; my spoken words never sound adequate or\r\ncomplete in print. Therefore, I sent a boy to the hotel for a copy of\r\nthe old stand-by, _Family Limitation_. The students set to work at once\r\nto translate it. Mrs. Clark offered to pay the expenses, and the next\r\nafternoon five thousand copies were ready for circulation.\r\n\r\nThis little incident was significant of Young China; an idea to them was\r\nuseless if only in the head. Their motto was to put it into concrete\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nSymptomatic also of new China was the abandonment of bound feet,\r\nalthough women of advanced years still were to be seen leaning on each\r\nother for support as they tottered by. Amahs were carrying nurselings\r\nabout when they themselves seemed scarcely able to stand up. However, I\r\nwas glad to see only a few of the small children had these lily feet.\r\nFathers realized their daughters could not earn a living if thus\r\ndeformed. At the Peking Union Medical College, combining the modern\r\nequipment of the Occident with the artistry and traditions of the\r\nOrient, no girl was accepted for training unless her feet were normal.\r\n\r\nOne day Dr. Hu-Shih asked me to lunch in an old Manchu restaurant where\r\nhis friends were accustomed to gather and ponder. Many were business or\r\nprofessional men, but all, with their little beards and intellectual\r\nfaces, had the appearance of professors. It was an unusual combination\r\nof Wall Street and university. In our private dining room were seven\r\nEnglish-speaking Chinese with families of from four to nine children.\r\nEach said the later ones had not been wanted; nevertheless they had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took a scientific turn. Since man had through breeding\r\nbrought about such changes in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, why\r\ncould he not produce a class of human beings unable to procreate? Was\r\nthere any reason why the particular biological factors that made the\r\nmule sterile could not be applied further? They discussed the\r\ninteresting possibility of creating a neuter gender such as the workers\r\nin a beehive or ant hill.\r\n\r\nThe implications of this colloquy formed a fascinating climax to our\r\nsojourn in Peking. Our train was the last one south for several days.\r\nSoldiers cluttered the landscape—not alert or even military-looking, but\r\nmen or boys put into uniform and told how to act. The Tuchuns were all\r\ntrying to “unite” China, each in his own way. We read in the papers\r\nabout the war clouds hanging over the country, but nobody seemed to be\r\nexcited. We were not worried; being foreigners, we were assured, meant\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Yangtze Kiang was green and luxuriant; every inch of\r\nground was being utilized. Even space which should have been employed\r\nfor roads was given over to food production, and thousands of people\r\nwere born, lived, and died in boats on the river. Some water buffalo\r\nwaded in the mud of the rice fields, some horses worked the water\r\ntreadmills, but human labor predominated. Overpopulation and destitution\r\nwent hand in hand. In this land which Marco Polo once described as “a\r\npleasant haven of silks, spices, and fine manners,” all the hypothetical\r\nMalthusian bogeys had come true.\r\n\r\nForeigners at the International and French Settlements of Shanghai\r\nenjoyed much the same life as at home. Their hotels were the same, they\r\nmet the same sort of people, dressed in the same clothes, ate the same\r\nmeals; in fact, it was difficult to get Chinese food unless you knew\r\nexactly where to go. They came in droves, herded together, most of them\r\nbored to death. You could see they had appropriated the best of\r\neverything—the houses with gardens and walls, the clean rickshas, the\r\nwell-fed boys, the prosperity. The Chinese, in their own country, lived\r\non what was left, which was practically nothing. They huddled wistfully\r\non the fringes—horrible, abject, dirty.\r\n\r\nIt amazed me to see that Americans, French, and English could be so near\r\nand yet close their eyes to the wretched, degrading conditions of\r\ndevastating squalor in the native quarters. Once while a missionary was\r\nguiding me through the Chinese City, we noted a crowd, children\r\nincluded, gathered in curiosity around a leper woman. She was on the\r\nground, sighing and breathing heavily. Nobody offered to help her.\r\n“Maybe she’s dying,” said my companion. Just then the woman gave a\r\nfearful groan and took a baby from under her rags. She knew what to do,\r\nmanipulated her thighs and abdomen, got the afterbirth, bit the cord\r\nwith her teeth, put the baby aside, turned over, and rested. No trace of\r\nemotion showed on the faces of the watchers.\r\n\r\nIn their respective countries Europeans would have made an effort to\r\nimprove such conditions. But here they seemed to have lost many of their\r\nformer standards and qualities of character and conscience. It was said\r\nthat China, psychologically speaking, swallowed up the morals of all\r\nthose who came to reside there.\r\n\r\nOne young American secretary related to me the joys of living in this\r\nsection of the Orient. She said her salary was far smaller than any she\r\nwould have received in the United States, but her comfort, on the other\r\nhand, far exceeded what she could have had in Boston at double her\r\npresent wages. Among them she mentioned her ricksha boy, who cost her\r\nonly five dollars a month, out of which he had to support himself and\r\nhis enormous family. During the three years he had been working for her\r\nshe had never raised his pay, nor did she ever expect to. He dared make\r\nno request, because in China it was almost impossible to get a job by\r\none’s self. When a servant was dismissed he faced practical starvation.\r\nI really formed a bad impression of people who wanted to live in China\r\nbecause of the cheapness of its luxuries.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Hotel was elegantly appointed, but the boys who served in the\r\nrooms did not seem friendly in their hearts towards any foreigners.\r\nHostility was percolating throughout the country. Deep in the Chinese\r\nmind lay the memory of many invasions, of the Boxer Rebellion, and the\r\nintrusion of business men and, particularly, missionaries.\r\n\r\nIn Shanghai the American missionaries dominated Chinese education, such\r\nas it was. I was surprised to find families of eight or ten children the\r\nrule rather than the exception among them. Their salaries were raised\r\nwith each new infant, and that may have been the reason. Nevertheless,\r\nthere were many who wanted birth control information. When they learned\r\nof my presence they called on the telephone, sent cards, came to see me.\r\nBut, apparently apprehensive of criticism, they took me if possible into\r\na secluded room or, if we had to meet in a public place, backed me into\r\na corner and stood in front to conceal the fact they were talking with\r\nme; they acted as though they were turning up their coat collars so that\r\nthey should not be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe only method of family limitation known to the poor Chinese was\r\ninfanticide of girl babies by suffocation or drowning. The missionaries\r\nwere co-operating with the Government, which had enacted a law\r\nforbidding the practice. They went from home to home to see whether any\r\nwoman were pregnant. If one were obviously so, her name was jotted down\r\nin a notebook for a call soon after birth was due. At the same time both\r\nfather and mother were informed of the severe penalty they would incur\r\nunless the baby itself or a doctor’s certificate of death from natural\r\ncauses were produced. After two years’ work ninety-five percent of\r\npregnant mothers showed either their babies or good reasons for not\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nBut the Chinese had so low a margin of subsistence that, if the law\r\nforbade them to dispose of one child, another was starved out. Sometimes\r\ntwo little girls had to be sold to keep one boy alive; in dire necessity\r\neven he might have to be parted with to some sonless man who wanted to\r\nensure ancestor worship. Because the elder girls could begin to help in\r\nthe fields or become servants in some rich landowner’s household,\r\nusually it was the three- and four-year-olds who were turned over to\r\nbrothels. There they stayed until mature enough to be set to working out\r\ntheir indenture. If they ever tried unsuccessfully to find freedom, the\r\nproprietors might beat them unmercifully, sometimes even breaking their\r\nlegs so that they could not walk, much less ever run away again.\r\n\r\nWhen infanticide was stopped, the corresponding increase in sing-song\r\ngirls making their living by prostitution was almost immediately\r\nevident. It was estimated Shanghai had a hundred thousand. Many were\r\nEurasians, the results of unions with white men who were in Shanghai on\r\nsmall salaries as representatives of foreign business firms. I glimpsed\r\nsome of the Chinese women who had been bought as housekeepers and\r\nmistresses as well saying good-by at the train to their American or\r\nEnglish masters summoned home.\r\n\r\nDesiring to see the worst of the city I went to the prostitute quarter\r\nin company with Mr. Blackstone, a missionary from the Door of Hope, a\r\nhouse of refuge for escaping girls. In Shanghai, as in Tokyo, we found\r\nin the Japanese section soft, low lights and an undercurrent of music in\r\nthe air. The inmates were fully grown, gay and hearty, the interiors\r\nwere immaculate and restrained in their decoration, the streets were\r\nswarming with sailors who apparently preferred this district to the\r\ndepressingly dark and gloomy Chinese one near by.\r\n\r\nHere and there the Chinese prostitutes could be seen through the open\r\ndoorways, heavily rouged, gowned in vivid colors, limned like posters\r\nagainst the meanness of the background, their frail, slight bodies at\r\nthe service of anyone who came. Each took her turn upon a stool outside,\r\nusing her few words of English to attract the sailor trade. I thought I\r\nwould never recover from the shock of seeing American men spending their\r\nevenings at such places with what were obviously children.\r\n\r\nIn one house we found half a dozen girls looking much younger than their\r\ntheoretical fifteen seated on hard benches around a room not more than\r\nsix feet by nine. A little one holding high a lamp so that we should not\r\ntrip and fall, escorted us to her cubicle, which had only a bed for\r\nfurniture. A chair was brought in for me.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackstone began to talk to her in her own dialect. Why had she\r\ncome?\r\n\r\n“Too much baby home—no chow.” She said she was sixteen and had been\r\nthere since she was twelve.\r\n\r\n“Why she can’t be a day over ten,” I expostulated.\r\n\r\nThe child was visibly frightened, aghast at her own loquacity. We might\r\nbe from the Government. When we had at last gained her confidence,\r\nhowever, she responded eagerly to this unusual sympathetic contact,\r\ntalking freely about herself—the long time it took to pay herself out,\r\nthe precariousness and physical fatigue of her calling; some days she\r\nhad no visitors, but when a ship was in maybe as many as ten or twelve a\r\nnight. She seemed as old as the ages in her knowledgeableness; “No want\r\nbaby,” she told us. Yet her poor little frame had the immaturity of\r\nfruit picked green and left to shrivel.\r\n\r\nWe gave her money and left in spite of her urgent and kind invitation to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nAll sing-song girls were not necessarily prostitutes; most hotels hired\r\nthem to entertain guests. Only their lips were made up, their faces\r\nremaining pale. They wore flowers in their hair and although not so\r\nsoft-voiced as the geisha had greater independence. Certainly their\r\nweird, shrill songs accompanied by the tinkle of a lute were not\r\nattractive to Western ears.\r\n\r\nEchoes of my visit to Japan had permeated throughout the colony of\r\nJapanese, who aimed to give me an extra-cordial welcome, trying their\r\nbest to make up for what they thought had been an unpleasant experience\r\nin their country. I had not realized the power of ancient feudalism over\r\nthe Japanese woman until I met her away from home, where she blossomed\r\ninto an intelligent, outspoken human being. I noticed she expressed\r\nherself much more frankly in the presence of men, but underneath the\r\nconversation I often sensed a propaganda which had resulted in deep\r\nprejudice; from the horrible stories you heard of the savagery of the\r\nChinese you received the impression all were cannibals.\r\n\r\nSince my plans to include China in my itinerary had been made so late, I\r\nhad few letters of introduction there. Consequently, to my regret I did\r\nnot see many Chinese women. I had not expected to do much speaking and\r\nhad had very little press in Peking. Dr. Hu-Shih, however, had arranged\r\nfor me to meet about fifteen newspaper men and women in Shanghai. We\r\nsipped our tea, nibbled our cakes, and then they began to ask questions,\r\ntaking down the answers with the utmost care. They wanted to set forth\r\nthe pros and cons of birth control in their own vernacular, but\r\nunfortunately could not reach the illiterate masses. They asked me to\r\nspeak at the Family Reformation Association, an organization which was\r\nunder missionary auspices. The rules were no smoking, no drinking, no\r\ngambling. Its membership, therefore, remained small.\r\n\r\nThe young woman who interpreted paragraph by paragraph had just returned\r\nfrom America, but did not prove the expert her traveling had indicated.\r\nThe chairman said I was to give both theory and practice, but when I\r\ncame to the latter my translator’s courage took flight entirely. She\r\nwhispered, “I’ll get a doctor to say that.” I gave up and switched to\r\nsomething simpler. My audience, however, knew without her assistance\r\nwhat I had been trying to convey, and was much diverted by her\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\nOf all lands China needed knowledge of how to control her numbers; the\r\nincessant fertility of her millions spread like a plague. Well-wishing\r\nforeigners who had gone there with their own moral codes to save her\r\nbabies from infanticide, her people from pestilence, had actually\r\nincreased her problem. To contribute to famine funds and the support of\r\nmissions was like trying to sweep back the sea with a broom.\r\n\r\nChina represented the final act in an international tragedy of\r\noverpopulation, seeming to prove that the eminence of a country could\r\nnot be measured by numbers any more than by industrial expansion, large\r\nstanding armies, or invincible navies. If its sons and daughters left\r\nfor the generations to come a record of immortal poetry, art, and\r\nphilosophy, then it was a great nation and had attained the only\r\nimmortality worth striving for. But China, once the fountainhead of\r\nwisdom, had been brought to the dust by superabundant breeding.\r\n\r\nThis was my conclusion when at last we were back again in the modern age\r\non the American ship _Silver State_ bound for Hong Kong; we had comfort,\r\nhot water, baths, heard the softness of the little chimes as the steward\r\nwent through the corridors announcing meals. It was almost with a sense\r\nof awe that I asked for any service. After being some time in the Orient\r\nyou were a bit embarrassed by having an American wait on you. Soon,\r\nhowever, the plumbers, the carpenters, the painters who kept the vessel\r\ntrim, the sailors who swabbed down the decks at night, gave me a feeling\r\nthat in the Western countries we had gone far towards dignifying manual\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-eight_\r\n\r\n                 THE WORLD IS MUCH THE SAME EVERYWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nA favorite sales promotion method of astrologers is to send partial\r\nreadings to people whose names appear in the papers, in the hope of\r\npiquing their curiosity to the point of demanding fuller details\r\nregarding their future lives and conduct. From time to time I used to\r\nreceive these and paid no attention. But just before I had sailed from\r\nCalifornia a friend of birth control had sent me one based upon arrests\r\nand prison. This forecast told me I would have a great deal of\r\ndifficulty in starting, and that on a certain day in May the same signs\r\nwould prevail over my House as at the Town Hall Meeting—that I should,\r\ntherefore, be prepared for police interference.\r\n\r\nWhile packing in Shanghai I was looking through my briefcase and\r\nhappened to note that the date was one on which the _Silver State_ would\r\nstill be at sea; she was not due at Hong Kong until the next day. I\r\nlaughed to myself and said, “Here’s where I prove it wrong.” As it\r\nturned out, however, the ship was ahead of her schedule and arrived in\r\nHong Kong twelve hours early.\r\n\r\nWe were steaming up the long reach towards the Kowloon piers when, to my\r\nutter surprise, the immigration officer who had come on board handed me\r\na notice instructing me to visit the Chief of Police.\r\n\r\n“Is this a special invitation for me, or is everybody included?”\r\n\r\n“Only for you, Madam,” was the smiling response.\r\n\r\nThe harbor was crowded with junks and fishing boats. Children in sampans\r\nwere holding out nets for whatever might come overside, fishing up each\r\nbit of refuse from the water. Adjoining ships were being coaled by women\r\ncoolies, hundreds of them, their faces strained and bodies stringy as\r\nthough made up entirely of tendons. They carried their two baskets on\r\nbamboo poles across their shoulders, and clambered like ants in their\r\nbare feet over the barges—not singing as the men coolies of the North,\r\nbut making much _wallah-wallah_—jabbering and shouting.\r\n\r\nAfter settling Grant in a hotel I took a chair from around the corner,\r\nbecause police headquarters was part way up the Peak, and rickshas could\r\nnot negotiate the steep ascent. The Chief was not there. I inquired\r\nwhether anything were wrong with my passport. Since my British visa was\r\nperfectly correct, they said there must be some mistake; they had no\r\ninformation about any summons. I left my card.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Chief called at my hotel but we missed each other\r\nbecause I was out with Grant ordering his first pair of long trousers.\r\nWhen I returned I found a calling card and another request to come to\r\nheadquarters that afternoon. Again I obeyed, and again I found no Chief\r\nand no message for me. I left another card and the officials whom I had\r\nseen before laughingly reiterated they still knew of no complaints.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m going tomorrow morning. If the Chief wants anything he’ll\r\nhave to come to the hotel.” He never did.\r\n\r\nOnce more we were off, this time on a British liner. The sea was smooth,\r\nthe air cool. It was the ideal ocean voyage I had always longed for. I\r\nwas relaxed and enervated but it was good to be so. I had nothing to do\r\nall day but sit in the glorious breezes on deck and watch the romping\r\nchildren, about fifty of whom were on board. Many had been born in the\r\nOrient and were accompanying “pater” who was going home on leave. One\r\nlittle boy might come tearing by pursued by another, both followed by\r\nanxious Chinese amahs, thin, dark, slick-haired, wearing glossy, black\r\ntrousers and coats buttoned down the side. They seemed in constant\r\ndistress over the antics of their energetic charges.\r\n\r\nWhen we dropped anchor at Singapore, agitation and excitement were again\r\nmanifest among the inspectors at the sight of my passport. I was\r\npolitely asked to stand by while they consulted, and then was ushered\r\noff the ship to an upstairs office where I was questioned by a pleasant\r\nyoung Englishman as to my intentions in going to India.\r\n\r\n“But I’m not planning to stop in India.”\r\n\r\n“Lectures by you are announced in Bombay and Calcutta.”\r\n\r\n“This is the first I’ve heard of it,” I assured him. “But if I were to\r\ngo, would there be any objection?”\r\n\r\n“That would depend on the subject of your lectures.”\r\n\r\n“I’m interested in only one subject.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button. Miraculously, almost like a scene from a mystery\r\nplay, and as though everything had been rehearsed in advance, an\r\nattendant entered and placed on the desk a large, closely typewritten\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n“Am I on the blacklist?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, but you said you were interested in only one subject. Then\r\nwhat about this?” He actually read me from that document details of a\r\nsmall reception I had given five years before in my own apartment in New\r\nYork for Agnes Smedley after her release on bail.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was speechless with amazement. Then I ejaculated, “Why\r\nshouldn’t I be interested when she was arrested for a cause that is my\r\nown? Besides, you must remember the charge was later dismissed.”\r\n\r\n“Then what about serving on the Committee for the Debs Defence and for\r\nthe Political Prisoners Defence?” He mentioned other gatherings I had\r\nattended during that parlor meeting era, such as when Mary Knoblauch had\r\nhad Jim Larkin talk on Irish Home Rule or Lajpat Rai, the Indian\r\nsociologist, express anti-British tendencies. Wherever my name had\r\nappeared on the stationery of any committee he had it on his record. My\r\npublic life was there spread out, showing how careful was British\r\nespionage.\r\n\r\nI brought forth from my arsenal some of my most trusty arguments, and\r\nthe official ultimately agreed that if the vast millions of India wanted\r\nbirth control he was all for my going there and would visa my passport.\r\nHowever, since I did not propose to include it in my trip the discussion\r\nwas purely academic.\r\n\r\nAlthough Singapore when we reached it seemed to combine so many\r\nnationalities that it was like Europe, America, and the Orient all mixed\r\ntogether, Malays, whose land it once had been, appeared to be in the\r\nminority and their dialect little used. I could not escape that fatal\r\nhoroscope, because when their language was described to me as easy and\r\nsimple, the example given was _mata_. By itself it meant eye. But, _mata\r\nmata_, in addition to being the plural, also meant policemen, who were\r\nthe eyes of the government, and _mata mata glap_ meant secret eyes,\r\nhence detectives.\r\n\r\nHow Europeans made themselves understood in Singapore was a wonder to\r\nme. The Chinese ricksha boys apparently comprehended no tongue, nor knew\r\nwhere any place was. You stepped into a ricksha and pointed to where you\r\nthought your hotel was, praying your finger was extended in the right\r\ndirection. If you did not point he ran in any direction of the compass.\r\nEven so, at the first corner he was inclined to turn into a more shady\r\nstreet. After a while, since he seemed to be arriving nowhere, you spoke\r\nto him sharply and he pulled up to a traffic officer, who told him where\r\nto go. Still pointing and saying “hotel” loudly, you eventually were\r\ndelivered in front of the door by a much pleased coolie, grinning from\r\near to ear at his own cleverness. The poor fellows were so cheerful and\r\nwilling that you could not help smiling, too.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued balmy to Penang, to Ceylon, to Aden. I had been\r\ndreading the heat of the Red Sea, but the passage was surprisingly cool;\r\nthe facing wind was really enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo, where we made a longer pause, Grant came down with dysentery\r\nand his temperature shot to a hundred and four degrees. A\r\nCzechoslovakian doctor spent three nights with him but could not reduce\r\nthe fever. Each morning when I rose early to act as nurse, I stumbled\r\nover about six natives, our own guide Ali among them, kneeling on prayer\r\nrugs in front of his door. All the fortune tellers had said a death was\r\npending in Shepheard’s Hotel and were assuming he would be the victim.\r\nThe fourth day, after the doctor had gone to his office, I ordered a\r\ndish pan full of ice and sponged Grant off with the frosty water. Two\r\nhours later his temperature was normal and he began to show signs of\r\nrecovering. I never divulged that cold bath to the doctor.\r\n\r\nAli was a handsome, dark-faced Arab with large luminous eyes and\r\nfine-cut features which made American ones seem crude and weak in\r\ncomparison. Wearing his long black robe to the ground and topped by a\r\nred fez, he used to come to his duties bearing great armfuls of flowers\r\nfrom his mother. We held lengthy conversations. “Have you been married?”\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, five times.”\r\n\r\n“Weren’t any of them happy?”\r\n\r\nHe began enumerating. The first one had been young and inexperienced;\r\nshe had not been properly brought up and did not know her position as\r\nhis wife. Although she had cost him a hundred dollars, he had dispatched\r\nher to her parents because she was too independent. Number two had not\r\nbeen clean and had been too old for his mother to train; he had made\r\namicable arrangements with her father for her return, and had lost no\r\nmoney on this transaction. Number three had been sickly, and a great\r\nexpense; she also had gone back. Number four had not loved him; it had\r\nbeen shortly evident her heart was with another man and the agreement\r\nhad been broken by mutual consent. Number five, the latest, he had sent\r\nhome because she would not wait on his mother.\r\n\r\n“Why should she?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, my mother carried me in her belly for nine months. Should I have\r\na wife who would not work for her after that?”\r\n\r\nHe was now casting about for his sixth.\r\n\r\nAli haunted our footsteps and, in order to collect his five percent\r\ncommission on all our purchases, noted every place we went. Merchants\r\nmade a social affair of their customers’ calls. You went to a perfume\r\nshop in the Bazaar. The proprietor said, “Yes,” sat down, and handed you\r\na gold-tipped, aromatic cigarette. He lighted it for you, took out a\r\npile of letters from a bag, and opened them for your inspection. They\r\nwere testimonials that a certain gentleman had sent similar cigarettes\r\nto Hartford, Connecticut, or Pelham, New York. Of course, you bought\r\nsome. Then a cup of Persian tea was brought you, and you wanted some of\r\nthat. At last you recalled that you had come for attar of roses. By this\r\ntime he had sensed your “aura” and knew what you could pay. He was\r\nwilling humbly to mention the price.\r\n\r\nOur tour had been a wonderful experience for Grant. He had studied the\r\nBaedekers, planned our trips when we were coming to a new city or\r\ncountry, looked into their histories and, although he was only thirteen,\r\nshown a highly awake and intelligent attitude towards everything we had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nHe had had all sorts of wares hurled at him—ostrich feathers, fans,\r\nbaskets, sapphires, scarabs. He was satiated with strange sights and\r\nlore—Buddha’s Temple of the Tooth at Kandy, caravans of bullocks, the\r\nEnglish club at tiny Port Swettenham in Malaya, the enormous porters of\r\nEgypt who picked up trunks as though they were handbags, women veiled\r\nand women unveiled, mosques, the Coptic church where Joseph and Mary\r\nwere supposed to have hidden Jesus from Herod, the date trees along the\r\nroad to Memphis, the underground Temple of the Bull, the remains of an\r\nold proud world at Alexandria where Cleopatra had once held court, the\r\nprimitive ferry-raft on which we had crossed the Nile to see the place\r\nwhere Moses had been found in the bullrushes, the wonderful ride, weird\r\nand lovely, across the Sahara to view the Pyramids and Sphinx. On his\r\nway to Switzerland he had traveled by gondola along the canals of\r\nVenice, had been trailed through the art galleries of Milan.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks at Montreux Grant was fully recovered, but he was now\r\nhomesick for the first time since we had left New York eight months\r\nbefore. All he wanted was to see Tilden play in the tennis matches at\r\nWimbledon, and then go home. Because I did not think he should miss the\r\nreception which H.G. was giving, I had him fly across the Channel to\r\nLondon, and afterwards, appreciating his longing to be among his own age\r\nand kind, I shipped him off on the maiden voyage of the _Majestic_ to a\r\ncamp in the Poconos. By the time he was back at Peddie he was up with\r\nhis class, his mind vastly enriched, and able to approach his studies in\r\na more mature manner. I have never regretted taking him with me.\r\n\r\nI myself remained in London for the Fifth International Neo-Malthusian\r\nand Birth Control Conference to be held July 11–14. The inclusion of the\r\nwords birth control was a definite concession on the part of the\r\nNeo-Malthusians to the new trend of thought. It was a delight to be amid\r\nconditions where tolerance reigned and the atmosphere was unblighted by\r\nlegal restrictions. The scientific candor of the discussion was reported\r\nin the newspapers with sincerity and sobriety.\r\n\r\nJohn Maynard Keynes, who had become famous almost overnight as the\r\nresult of his book, _The Consequences of the Peace_, presided at one of\r\nthe afternoon meetings. Later, I had lunch with him. He was tall and\r\nwell-built, with clear, cold, blue eyes, a fine shapely head, brow, and\r\nface, a brilliant bearing and brilliant intellect. I was impressed by\r\nthe fact he did not smile. Because he gave each question of yours so\r\nmuch consideration, he seemed constantly perplexed, but when he once\r\nstarted to talk you knew he had already put aside the thing as having\r\nbeen solved, and gone on in advance. You were probably more puzzled at\r\nhis next question than he at yours.\r\n\r\nIn the two years that elapsed before I saw Keynes again he had married\r\nLydia Lopokouva of the Russian Ballet. He had become an entirely\r\ndifferent person—his serious mien and countenance had been changed to a\r\nbuoyant, joyous happiness. His knowledge of the problems of money,\r\npopulation, and economics were of a nature far above the grasp of an\r\nordinary intelligence, yet in his conversation with his wife he always\r\nimplied she knew the subject as thoroughly as he, and answered her\r\nqueries as though their minds were together. He was the only Englishman,\r\nperhaps the only man, I ever knew to do this.\r\n\r\nUnlike Lydia Lopokouva, most women had a strenuous battle trying to\r\nprove themselves equal to men; this marriage conflict was inseparable\r\nfrom modern life. I could sense it frequently when coming in contact\r\nwith a married couple—on her part the years of rebellion, and on his of\r\ntrying to put her down as a weakling.\r\n\r\nSentiment has extolled the young love which promises to last through\r\neternity. But love is a growth mingled with a succession of experiences;\r\nit is as foolish to promise to love forever as to promise to live\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nTo every woman there comes the apprehension that marriage may not\r\nfulfill her highest expectations and dreams. If in the heart of a girl\r\nentering this covenant for the first time there are doubts, even in the\r\nslightest degree, they are doubled and trebled in their intensity when\r\nshe meditates a second marriage.\r\n\r\nJ. Noah H. Slee, whom I had known for some time, was what the papers\r\ncalled “a staid pillar of finance.” He was South African born but had\r\nmade his fortune in the United States. In customs and exteriors we were\r\nas far apart as the poles; he was a conservative in politics and a\r\nchurchman, whereas I voted for Norman Thomas and, instead of attending\r\northodox services, preferred to go to the opera.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned type of man, J.N. yearned to protect any type of woman\r\nwho would cling. Complications, therefore, confronted us. I had been\r\nfree for nearly ten years, and, for as long, had been waging a campaign\r\nto free other women. I was startled by the thought of joining my life to\r\nthat of one who objected to his wife’s coming home alone in a taxi at\r\nnight, or assumed she could not buy her own railroad tickets or check\r\nher baggage. Nevertheless, despite his foibles, he was generous in\r\nwanting me to continue my unfinished work, and was undeterred by my\r\nwarning that he would always have to be kissing me good-by in depots or\r\nwaving farewell as the gangplank went up.\r\n\r\nI had to consider also that I had two boys to be educated, and that\r\nchildren were much more to a woman than to a man. Yet I knew he would be\r\nkind and understanding with them. Furthermore, he had faith both in\r\nindividuals and in humanity; his naïve appearance of hardness was\r\nactually not borne out in fact. He kept his promises and hated debts; we\r\nattached the same importance to the spirit of integrity.\r\n\r\nHundreds of people who scarcely knew me were delighted when the news of\r\nour marriage eventually became public. Within one week letters began to\r\narrive from all over the United States and Canada. One man wrote he had\r\nhelped me get up a meeting at San Francisco and now needed a printing\r\npress—would I mail him the trifling sum of three thousand dollars?\r\nAnother brought to mind I had had dinner at his home when lecturing in\r\nhis city, and now that he had painted enough pictures to hold an\r\nexhibit, would I finance it? Dozens of ministers, old men, old ladies,\r\nwriters, sculptors wanted me to set them up in business, musical concert\r\nwork, bookshops, recalling the time they had taken me in cars to\r\nmeetings, or that I had slept in their beds. Parents requested me to\r\nsend their children to schools, to Europe, to sanatoriums—heaven knows\r\nwhat. I never knew people could need so much. I longed with all the\r\ndesire in me to make out a check for every lack and wave a magic wand\r\nand say, “So be it.”\r\n\r\nBut all I could do was write back that I had no more wealth than\r\nbefore—my husband’s was his own. And I still required as many\r\ncontributions to birth control as ever.\r\n\r\nI had not wanted the worry or trouble of handling money, nor do I want\r\nit today. The things I valued then I value now, not for what they cost,\r\nbut for what they are. To me dollars and cents are only messengers to do\r\nmy bidding, and nothing more. To use them properly and get results is my\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked J.N., “Why do you lock things up?” he replied, “I always\r\ndo, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Never. I haven’t anything worth locking up.”\r\n\r\nThat is the way I still feel.\r\n\r\nIt seemed so final when again I started a home, but there had been a\r\ngathering loneliness in my life—not seeing the children except on\r\nholidays, never having time to spend with old friends or to make new\r\nones, and with such rich opportunities constantly offering themselves. I\r\nknew very well, however, what sort of a house I wanted—a simple one,\r\nsomething like Shelley’s in Sussex.\r\n\r\nIn 1923, with stones gathered from the fields we built a house near\r\nFishkill, New York, cradled in the Dutchess County hills, beside a\r\nlittle lake. On it we tried out swans, but they did not work; although\r\nthey looked picturesque, they were too messy. So we changed to ducks and\r\nstocked the water with bass. I planned a blue garden which grew up and\r\ndown and threw itself about the house and altered with the seasons.\r\nPepper, a cocker spaniel puppy of two months, came the first year and\r\nbounced and leaped around us as we walked through the woods or rode\r\nhorseback over the hills.\r\n\r\nWillow Lake was only sixty miles from New York. I could make out the\r\nmenus for a week ahead, leave directions for the gardening, be in my\r\noffice fairly early and back again for dinner at night. Later, for\r\nworking purposes, we built a studio among the treetops on the edge of a\r\ncliff from which I could look far off across the majestic valley of the\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nDomesticity, which I had once so scorned, had its charms after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Twenty-nine_\r\n\r\n                       WHILE THE DOCTORS CONSULT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter coming back from around the world I found nothing had been done\r\nabout the Tenth Street clinic, which I had expected to be in operation.\r\nNo members of the Academy of Medicine had come forth to back Dr. de\r\nVilbiss, and I had paid the rent for the last twelve months while vainly\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nNow I gave it up and decided to start afresh. The more I had studied,\r\nthe more clearly I had recognized that it was not possible to advise a\r\nstandard contraceptive for all women any more than it was possible to\r\nprescribe one set of eyeglasses for all conditions of sight. Only upon\r\nexamination and careful check-up could you determine the most suitable\r\nmethod. No detailed statistics had ever been kept except at Brownsville,\r\nand those case histories had never been returned to me by the police. I\r\nwanted to collect at least a thousand such records for a scientific\r\nsurvey before any opposition could interfere with the plan.\r\n\r\nMany women were still coming to me personally for information at 104\r\nFifth Avenue. The best thing to do was have a woman doctor right there\r\nto take care of them—a quiet way to begin. It was hard to locate one\r\nfoot-loose and free; I could have no shying or running off at the first\r\nindication of trouble. In making inquiries I heard of Dr. Dorothy\r\nBocker, who held a New York City license though she was at present in\r\nthe Public Health Service of Georgia. This single, cordial, and\r\nenthusiastic young woman knew practically nothing about birth control\r\ntechnique, but was willing to learn. The difficulty was that she wanted\r\nfive thousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\nAt first this appeared an almost unsurmountable obstacle. Here was just\r\nthe person I had been looking for, but it seemed beyond my power to\r\nraise so large a sum. I was loaded with the financial weight of the\r\n_Review_ and the League. That organization had been admitted as a\r\nmembership corporation and hence could not secure a license to conduct a\r\nclinic, which in New York was synonymous with a dispensary. No clinic,\r\ntherefore, could be included in its budget; it would remain a department\r\nof the League by courtesy only, being actually my private undertaking.\r\nWhere could I find someone to donate such an enormous amount?\r\n\r\nThen I remembered Clinton Chance, a young manufacturer of Birmingham,\r\nwho had prospered exceedingly both before and during the War. He and his\r\nwife, Janet, had become good friends of mine during my 1920 visit to\r\nEngland. Having felt the need of a more sound and fundamental outlet for\r\nhis riches than that provided by charity, he had come to see that birth\r\ncontrol information was far better for his employees than a dole at the\r\nbirth of every new baby. He was not in any sense a professional\r\nphilanthropist, but only wanted to help them be self-sufficient.\r\n\r\nClinton had once offered me money to set the birth control movement\r\ngoing in England, but I had refused then because England had enough\r\nco-workers, who were handling the situation well, and, furthermore, my\r\nplace was in the United States. He had then said to me, “I won’t give\r\nyou a contribution for regular current expenses, but if ever you see the\r\nnecessity for some new project which will advance the general good, call\r\non me.”\r\n\r\nNow I cabled Clinton at length, explaining my need. He promptly\r\nanswered, “Yes, go ahead,” and soon arrived an anonymous thousand pounds\r\nto cover Dr. Bocker’s salary for the first year. I made out a contract\r\nfor two. She was to come in January, 1923, and we were to shoulder the\r\nrisks and responsibilities together.\r\n\r\nEven to choose a name for the venture was not easy. I had been steadily\r\nadvertising the term “clinic” to America for so long that it had become\r\nfamiliar and, moreover, to poor people it meant that little or no\r\npayment was required. But the use of the word itself was legally\r\nimpossible, and I was not certain that the same might not be true of\r\n“center” or “bureau.” I wanted it at least to imply the things that\r\nclinic meant as I had publicized it, and also to include the idea of\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nFinally, one of the doors of the two rooms adjoining the League offices,\r\nreadily accessible to me and to the women who came for advice, was\r\nlettered, Clinical Research.\r\n\r\nIt was still a clinic in my mind, though frankly an experiment because I\r\nwas not even sure women would accept the methods we had to offer them.\r\nWe started immediately keeping the records. Dr. Bocker wrote down the\r\nhistory of the case on a large card, numbering it to correspond with a\r\nsmaller one containing the patient’s name and address. Each applicant\r\nshe suspected of a bad heart, tuberculosis, kidney trouble, or any\r\nailment which made pregnancy dangerous, she informed regarding\r\ncontraception and advised medical care at once.\r\n\r\nIn our first annual report, which attracted much attention, all our\r\ncases were analyzed. We said, “Here is the proof—nine hundred women with\r\ndefinite statistics concerning their ages, physical and mental\r\nconditions, and economic status.”\r\n\r\nAs time went on I became less and less pleased with Dr. Bocker’s system.\r\nShe had no follow-up on patients, and I wished the clinic to be like a\r\nbusiness in the thoroughness of its routine. I refused to approve\r\nmethods as a hundred percent reliable until there had been not merely\r\none but three checks on each woman who had been to the clinic. To begin\r\nwith, she was to return two or three days after her initial visit; she\r\nusually did that. But if she did not come back inside three months, then\r\na social worker in our own employ should be sent to call on her.\r\nFinally, she was to be examined once a year. Dr. Bocker did not see eye\r\nto eye with me that this was the only way to put the work on a sound\r\nscientific basis of facts, and we agreed to part company in December of\r\nthe second year.\r\n\r\nDr. Hannah M. Stone, a fine young woman from the Lying-In Hospital,\r\nvolunteered to take Dr. Bocker’s place without salary. Her gaze was\r\nclear and straight, her hair was black, her mouth gentle and sweet. She\r\nhad a sympathetic response to mothers in distress, and a broad attitude\r\ntowards life’s many problems. When the Lying-In Hospital later found she\r\nhad connected herself with our clinic, it gave her a choice between\r\nremaining with us and resigning from the staff. She resigned. Her\r\ncourageous stand indicated staunch friendship and the disinterested\r\nselflessness essential for the successful operation of the clinic. These\r\nqualities have kept her with us all this time, one of the most beloved\r\nand loyal workers that one could ever hope for.\r\n\r\nThe clinic could serve New York, but its practical value outside was\r\nrestricted, and I was always seeking some way of remedying this. We took\r\nthe preliminary step in Illinois, where no laws existed against clinics.\r\nI had arranged a conference in Chicago at the Drake Hotel, October,\r\n1923, the first of a regional series. Mrs. Benjamin Carpenter and Dr.\r\nRachelle Yarros, who had been with Jane Addams at Hull House, had to\r\nobtain a court decision before Dr. Herman Bundesen, Commissioner of\r\nHealth, would issue a license for the second clinic in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, between 1921 and 1926, I received over a million letters from\r\nmothers requesting information. From 1923 on a staff of three to seven\r\nwas constantly busy just opening and answering them. Despite the\r\nlimitations of the writers and their lack of education, they revealed\r\nthemselves strangely conscious of the responsibilities of the maternal\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nChildbearing is hazardous, even when carried out with the advantages of\r\nmodern hygiene and parental care. The upper middle classes are likely to\r\nassume all confinements are surrounded by the same attention given the\r\nbirths of their own babies. They do not comprehend it is still possible\r\nin these United States for a woman to milk six cows at five o’clock in\r\nthe morning and bring a baby into the world at nine. The terrific\r\nhardships of the farm mother are not in the least degree lessened by\r\nmaternity. If she and her infant survive, it is only to face these\r\nhardships anew, and with additional complications.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of an era of science and fabulous wealth reaching out for\r\nenlightenment to advance our civilization, with millionaires tossing\r\ntheir fortunes into libraries and hospitals and laboratories to discover\r\nthe secrets and causes of life, here at the doorstep of everyone was\r\nthis tragic, scarcely recognized condition.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy and even a pleasant task to reduce human problems to\r\nnumerical figures in black and white on charts and graphs, but\r\ninfinitely more difficult to suggest concrete solutions. The reasoning\r\nof learned theologians and indefatigable statisticians seemed academic\r\nand anemically intellectual if brought face to face with the actuality\r\nof suffering. When they confronted me with arguments, this dim, far-off\r\nchorus of pain began to resound anew in my ears.\r\n\r\nSensitive women of our clerical staff were constantly breaking down in\r\nhealth under the nervous depression caused by the fact we had so little\r\nknowledge to give. One who went to Chicago to help rehabilitate soldiers\r\nwrote me, “I’m feeling much better. These men who have lost a leg or arm\r\ncome in, apparently disqualified forever, but something is being done\r\nabout them, and it is happy work, not forlorn like yours.”\r\n\r\nTo prove that the story could be told by the mothers themselves, ten\r\nthousand letters, with the assistance of Mary Boyd, were selected and\r\nthese again cut to five hundred. Eventually this historical record\r\nappeared in book form as _Motherhood in Bondage_.\r\n\r\nWhenever I am discouraged I go to those letters as to a wellspring which\r\nsends me on re-heartened. They make me realize with increasing intensity\r\nthat whoever kindles a spark of hope in the breast of another cannot\r\nshirk the duty of keeping it alive.\r\n\r\n_Woman and the New Race_, which sold at first for two dollars, had a\r\ndistribution of two hundred and fifty thousand copies, and it made my\r\nheart ache to know that poor women who could ill afford it were buying\r\nthe book and not finding there what they sought. To the best of my\r\nability I tried to supply general information, but the only way of\r\nextending genuine aid was to persuade doctors to give it professionally.\r\n\r\nBy a happy chance I met Dr. James F. Cooper, tall, blond, distinguished,\r\na fine combination of missionary and physician, who left no stone\r\nunturned when a patient came to him, but devoted his whole attention to\r\nher—everything in her life was important to him. He was recently back\r\nfrom Fuchow, China, and was establishing himself in Boston as a\r\ngynecologist. Since he was thoroughly convinced of the vital necessity\r\nfor birth control and could talk technically to his profession and\r\ninterpret to the layman as well, my husband pledged his salary and\r\nexpenses for two years, and I induced him to associate himself with us\r\nas medical director to go forth and try to convince the doctors\r\nthroughout the country that contraceptive advice would save a large\r\nproportion of their women patients.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1925, Dr. Cooper started on a tour which covered nearly all\r\nthe states in the Union. In the course of the two years he delivered\r\nmore than seven hundred lectures. Occasionally he was suspected of\r\nulterior motives, of attempting to advertise the products he\r\nrecommended, but this did not sway him from his persistence. Where he\r\nfound laxity on the part of medical organizations he spoke to lay\r\nassociations, which applied pressure on their own physicians, demanding\r\ninformation. As a result of this trip, doctors really began to awake to\r\nthe problem of contraception, and when it was ended we had the names of\r\nsome twenty thousand from Maine to California who had consented to\r\ninstruct patients referred to them.\r\n\r\nAt this point began the huge and difficult process of decentralization,\r\nso that the New York office need no longer be a clearing house. Each\r\nrequest which lay outside the pale of the Cooper influence required\r\nvoluminous correspondence. One letter, enclosing a stamped,\r\nreturn-addressed envelope, was mailed to the woman, asking her to\r\nfurnish us the name of her doctor. We then wrote him to inquire whether\r\nhe would give her information, and offered to send supplies if she could\r\nnot afford them. If he said yes, we notified her to that effect; if he\r\nsaid no, we gave some other doctor in her vicinity an opportunity to\r\nco-operate.\r\n\r\nWe were immediately confronted with the situation that even willing\r\ndoctors had little to recommend. Literally thousands of women reported\r\nthat such ineffective methods had been tendered them they had refused to\r\npay. We ourselves did not have a great deal, and this put us in a weak\r\nposition; the acceptance of the theory was ahead of the means of\r\npracticing it.\r\n\r\nThe jelly I had found in Friedrichshaven had turned out to be too\r\nexpensive, because it was made with a chinosol and Irish moss base, and\r\nthe price of the former was prohibitive in preparing it for poor women.\r\nDr. Stone and Dr. Cooper, therefore, devised a formula for a jelly with\r\na lactic acid and glycerine base, which was within our means. Most of\r\ntheir cases, however, were sufficiently grave for them not to feel\r\njustified in using it alone experimentally. Consequently, they took the\r\nprecaution of having a double safeguard by combining the chemical\r\ncontraceptive with the mechanical—jelly with pessary—which proved\r\nninety-eight percent efficacious.\r\n\r\nAt this time we could not import diaphragms directly. Although I had\r\ngiven various friends going to Germany and England the mission of\r\nbringing them in, this could not be done in sufficient quantity.\r\nFurthermore, since bootlegging supplies could not continue indefinitely\r\nI had to find out how they could legally be made here.\r\n\r\nTwo young men came to help in whatever way was most necessary. Herbert\r\nSimonds, who had been in advertising, began to investigate the\r\npossibility that some recognized rubber company should make our\r\nsupplies. When one and all were fearful, he and Guy Moyston, who did\r\nsome publicity for us, concluded they would form the Holland-Rantos\r\nCompany, selling only to physicians or on prescription. They spent their\r\nown time and thousands of dollars personally on research, in the end\r\nperfecting a quality of rubber that could stand the variations of\r\nclimate in the United States—hot houses and cold winters, Florida\r\ndampness and Western dryness.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Julius Schmid, an old established manufacturer, had been\r\nimporting from his own concern in Germany a few diaphragms, but only on\r\na modest scale because he did not want to run afoul of the Comstock law.\r\nAs soon as he saw a potential market in the medical profession he\r\nfetched from the Fatherland several families who had been making molds\r\nthere, gave them places to live in, and set up a little center,\r\nexpanding gradually until eventually he sold more contraceptive supplies\r\nthan any firm in the world.\r\n\r\nBut this was all in the future.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had developed an organization in which economists,\r\nbiologists, and other scientists could be articulate, they came into the\r\nmovement. Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a tuberculosis specialist, who had been\r\none of the first to greet me when I came out of jail, never missed an\r\nopportunity to contribute articles to medical journals and to write\r\nletters. Professor Edward Alsworth Ross’s books continued to popularize\r\nthe sociological and economic aspects. Professor E. M. East of the Bussy\r\nInstitute of Harvard University published a study of population titled\r\n_Mankind at the Crossroads_, which obtained wide circulation. His\r\none-time pupil, Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins, was carrying on the\r\nsame work showing exactly how much food a certain number of acres could\r\nproduce at what cost. Universities generally began to show an interest;\r\nstudents wrote asking for scientific and historical data upon which to\r\nbase their theses.\r\n\r\nYoung people in colleges, partly because their ideas were not yet\r\nbiased, offered a fallow field for my personal campaign of education\r\nthrough lecturing. I particularly enjoyed their quickness and alertness\r\nand their interludes of comic relief. Nowhere has this combination been\r\nmore apparent than in a recent visit to Colgate University. Four boys\r\nmet me at the station and somehow or other we all squeezed into an\r\nautomobile which shortly deposited me at the home of one of the\r\nprofessors for tea and to meet the faculty. “This is house-party night,”\r\nhe told me. “The girls are here, and most of the boys won’t get to bed\r\nuntil daylight. We’ll have to rout them out to hear you at chapel\r\ntomorrow.” He added that during his twelve years in the University no\r\nwoman had spoken on that platform.\r\n\r\n“Have they prejudices against women speakers?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no. There’s just no subject a woman can deal with better than a\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nWell! I thought, if the boys will all have been out to parties and I’m\r\nthe first woman speaker, here is a challenge! No sociology or dull\r\npopulation figures for them from me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, determined to make them take notice, I ransacked my\r\nbag for my smartest dress, adjusted my lipstick, and carefully set my\r\nhat at an angle. Nevertheless, I was a bit ill at ease. My anxiety was\r\nnot allayed when Norman Himes, professor of sociology, said, “Now, Mrs.\r\nSanger, we probably shan’t be able to hear you in this hall. The\r\nacoustics are very bad. They can hardly hear me and I have a big voice.”\r\n\r\nThis was even less encouraging. I felt I was likely to be the last as\r\nwell as the first woman at Colgate. However, I replied bravely, “I can\r\nspeak up and we can have some wave if they can’t hear me. Anyhow, there\r\nprobably won’t be many; why can’t they be moved up front?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s what we’d better do.”\r\n\r\nWe went in to find the chapel jammed. Some of the students were standing\r\nin the door, others against the walls.\r\n\r\nProfessor Himes introduced me at the top of his lungs. “Louder! Louder!”\r\nThe boys waved their hands. The more he tried to make himself heard, the\r\nmore restless they became. When I stood, however, they had to listen if\r\nthey were to hear me. There was no waving, no calling. They roared with\r\nlaughter and clapped at everything I said. This seemed fine, but I\r\nsuspected that I could not have really made so profound an impression as\r\nto deserve so much applause.\r\n\r\nSomeone afterwards commented to Professor Himes, “We’ve never seen the\r\nboys so appreciative.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he remarked, “they thought if they could keep Mrs. Sanger talking\r\nlong enough they wouldn’t have to go to their examinations.”\r\n\r\nFrom the time I started lecturing in 1916 I have appeared in many\r\nplaces—halls, churches, women’s clubs, homes, theaters. I have had many\r\ntypes of audiences—cotton workers, churchmen, liberals, Socialists,\r\nscientists, clubmen, and fashionable, philanthropically minded women.\r\n\r\nOnce in Detroit Mrs. William McGraw, Sr. had organized a public meeting\r\nand luncheon at the Statler Hotel. When I arrived I encountered a\r\nsituation which might well have embarrassed a less doughty hostess. She\r\nhad invited a dozen of the most prominent women in the city to sit at\r\nthe speaker’s table. Mrs. A. had asked, “Will Mrs. B. sit there also?”\r\nMrs. B. had inquired, “Will Mrs. C. be next to me?” Each wanted social\r\nsupport. Mrs. McGraw had blandly refused to tell them; consequently not\r\none had accepted. Although five hundred came, only two places were set\r\nat the great banquet table on the platform. Mrs. McGraw and I ate in\r\nsolitary splendor with nothing but the floral decorations for company.\r\n\r\nAll the world over, in Penang and Skagway, in El Paso and Helsingfors, I\r\nhave found women’s psychology in the matter of childbearing essentially\r\nthe same, no matter what the class, religion, or economic status. Always\r\nto me any aroused group was a good group, and therefore I accepted an\r\ninvitation to talk to the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver\r\nLake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing.\r\n\r\nMy letter of instruction told me what train to take, to walk from the\r\nstation two blocks straight ahead, then two to the left. I would see a\r\nsedan parked in front of a restaurant. If I wished I could have ten\r\nminutes for a cup of coffee or bite to eat, because no supper would be\r\nserved later.\r\n\r\nI obeyed orders implicitly, walked the blocks, saw the car, found the\r\nrestaurant, went in and ordered some cocoa, stayed my allotted ten\r\nminutes, then approached the car hesitatingly and spoke to the driver. I\r\nreceived no reply. She might have been totally deaf as far as I was\r\nconcerned. Mustering up my courage, I climbed in and settled back.\r\nWithout a turn of the head, a smile, or a word to let me know I was\r\nright, she stepped on the self-starter. For fifteen minutes we wound\r\naround the streets. It must have been towards six in the afternoon. We\r\ntook this lonely lane and that through the woods, and an hour later\r\npulled up in a vacant space near a body of water beside a large,\r\nunpainted, barnish building.\r\n\r\nMy driver got out, talked with several other women, then said to me\r\nseverely, “Wait here. We will come for you.” She disappeared. More cars\r\nbuzzed up the dusty road into the parking place. Occasionally men\r\ndropped wives who walked hurriedly and silently within. This went on\r\nmystically until night closed down and I was alone in the dark. A few\r\ngleams came through chinks in the window curtains. Even though it was\r\nMay, I grew chillier and chillier.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours I was summoned at last and entered a bright corridor\r\nfilled with wraps. As someone came out of the hall I saw through the\r\ndoor dim figures parading with banners and illuminated crosses. I waited\r\nanother twenty minutes. It was warmer and I did not mind so much.\r\nEventually the lights were switched on, the audience seated itself, and\r\nI was escorted to the platform, was introduced, and began to speak.\r\n\r\nNever before had I looked into a sea of faces like these. I was sure\r\nthat if I uttered one word, such as abortion, outside the usual\r\nvocabulary of these women they would go off into hysteria. And so my\r\naddress that night had to be in the most elementary terms, as though I\r\nwere trying to make children understand.\r\n\r\nIn the end, through simple illustrations I believed I had accomplished\r\nmy purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were\r\nproffered. The conversation went on and on, and when we were finally\r\nthrough it was too late to return to New York. Under a curfew law\r\neverything in Silver Lake shut at nine o’clock. I could not even send a\r\ntelegram to let my family know whether I had been thrown in the river or\r\nwas being held incommunicado. It was nearly one before I reached\r\nTrenton, and I spent the night in a hotel.\r\n\r\nIn Brattleboro, Vermont, my audience was made up of another slice of\r\nAmerica—honest, strong, capable housewives who made their pies and\r\ndoughnuts and preserves before they came. When I had finished there was\r\nnot a murmur of commendation from the three hundred. The minister of the\r\nchurch where the meeting was held had asked me to stand beside him to\r\nsay how-do-you-do when they came out. They just went by, eyes straight\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nOn the telephone afterwards, however, each was asking what the other\r\nthought. The cases I had cited were typical of their own community. “Was\r\nshe referring to this one or that one?” they queried.\r\n\r\nI returned two days later to lunch with a doctor and four or five social\r\nworkers, and was surprised to hear, “The women want to start a clinic.”\r\n\r\n“But there wasn’t any enthusiasm when I suggested it the other morning.”\r\n\r\n“The people around here don’t express much openly. They were moved to\r\nquietness. But just the same they’re starting a clinic in Brattleboro.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Chapter Thirty_\r\n\r\n                      NOW IS THE TIME FOR CONVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSide by side with the clinic and education another project had been\r\nstirring for some time in my mind. Internationalism was in the air, and\r\nI wanted that outlook brought into the movement in the United States. To\r\nthis end I made plans for the Sixth International Malthusian and Birth\r\nControl Conference, to be held in New York in March, 1925.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1924 I called a Conference Committee meeting of the\r\nLeague. That is, in addition to the regular Board members, other\r\nsupporters were invited to attend. As soon as the matter was brought up\r\nthey expostulated, “You still have to ask for money to run the _Review_.\r\nHow can you pay the fares of the delegates and furnish them with\r\nhospitality? Do you know how much it will cost?”\r\n\r\nSince I wished to have the Conference important enough to make its mark\r\nI replied promptly, “Not less than twenty-five thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“Have you thought of how you are going to finance it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I have.” I was certain that the interest of many of our\r\ncontributors extended beyond the magazine, and that they would see we\r\nnow had a broader field of activity. They had given before and would\r\ngive again. I knew money would come in.\r\n\r\nAny five of the outside women present could have underwritten the\r\nConference, but they objected that funds were needed for other work. One\r\nby one they left in a hurry; the inevitable appointments were waiting\r\nfor them. Their advice to the Board was, no Conference—and the wealthy\r\nmembers of the Board concurred.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I went ahead with the details of securing backers. Even\r\nthe letterhead on our stationery was significant. You could tell such a\r\nlot about an organization—quality, standards, tone—from the names, often\r\nmore informative than the body of the letter. My intention was to make\r\npeople stand in public for what they believed in private, and at least\r\nour list of sponsors was impressive enough—a brilliant and distinguished\r\narray.\r\n\r\nThe success of any conference was determined in great measure by the\r\ncaliber of the men who took part in it. Results depended first upon the\r\nconcept animating it, and second, as had been proved before, on the\r\npresence of an eminent figure to ornament the assemblage. I decided to\r\nsee whether I could induce Lord Dawson to be our main speaker, and,\r\nhoping that personal persuasion might be more efficacious than written,\r\nsailed for England in September.\r\n\r\nHavelock came up from Margate to greet me, as usual far removed from the\r\nhurly-burly of the world, aloof from the conflict of ideas which meant\r\nso much to me. Yet to talk with him again was to return to the mêlée\r\nwith renewed inspiration. I managed to crowd in a motor trip to Oxford,\r\nlunch at the Mitre, a walk through Brazenose and King’s, and a drive\r\nback through Buckinghamshire, where the beeches were changing to bronze\r\nand russet. I felt a regretful pang that so little of my life could be\r\nlived in England.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for my purposes Lord Dawson was away shooting in the\r\nNorth. With some temerity I dwelt upon the possibility of Lord\r\nBuckmaster, the former Stanley Owen, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the\r\nAsquith Coalition of 1915, who had become one of the most finished\r\norators in the House of Lords. He had just returned from Scotland and\r\ntelephoned me to suggest we exchange views. He was about to present a\r\nresolution that, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health,\r\nrestrictions on birth control instruction be removed for married women\r\nwho attended welfare centers. He was gathering practical information\r\nfrom people who had had practical experience, and wanted to know how\r\nmethods in the United States differed from those in England and,\r\nparticularly, verification of their harmlessness.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to my hotel one afternoon, I did not take time to mention\r\nthe Conference, because H.G., knowing the value of proper introductions,\r\nhad arranged one of his most brilliant dinners for that very evening, or\r\nrather he had proposed it and Jane had arranged it. For H.G. to\r\nentertain in behalf of a cause set the seal of approval on it. Jane had\r\ninvited literary luminaries and their wives: George Bernard Shaw, Arnold\r\nBennett, Sir Arbuthnot Lane, Professor E. W. MacBride of the Eugenics\r\nEducation Society, Walter Salter of the League of Nations, and Lord\r\nBuckmaster.\r\n\r\nIt had been my experience that personages gave little of themselves on\r\nformal occasions. So many people expected these lions to roar bravely,\r\nforgetting that they preferred to save their sparkling sallies for the\r\npages of their books. Moreover, when the English came together for an\r\nevening they liked to have it light and amusing. I had received much\r\nfrom the books of Shaw, who had advanced civilization by breaking down\r\nbarriers of all sorts, now almost nothing from him personally, although\r\nhe was very diverting, with funny quips upon life and America and birth\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nI had by design been seated next to Lord Buckmaster, and after the meal\r\nhad been in progress for perhaps half an hour, H.G. leaned over and\r\nwhispered to me, “Have you got him?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t started yet.”\r\n\r\n“You’re no true American. You ought to work faster. You’re missing out.”\r\nWhereupon he focused his own attention on Lord Buckmaster, who, in\r\nanswer to his direct query, regretted that the date conflicted with the\r\nopening of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBefore I could realize it the time came when I was due to sail from\r\nSouthampton. Lord Dawson had just returned and could see me at three\r\nthat afternoon. Promptly on the hour his secretary ushered me into his\r\nlibrary at Wimpole Street. A fire was burning cheerfully in the grate, a\r\ngentleman, traditionally tall and handsome, was sitting leisurely on the\r\nsofa as though my boat train did not leave Waterloo Station at\r\nfour-thirty, and endless days remained in which to talk about the\r\ninteresting subject of birth control. He was a grand seigneur such as\r\nyou rarely encountered in your travels, having a mind that could\r\nunderstand and meet any discussion with knowledge, facts, and\r\ncomprehension. The approach, the surroundings, his courtesy, charm of\r\nmanner, and poise, proved him a great English aristocrat. He asked me\r\nabout the attitude of the medical profession in the United States,\r\ndesirous of knowing who had identified themselves with it. I recited my\r\npast efforts to enlist the support of the leading physicians. The\r\nminutes sped relentlessly away; I had to leave, and barely caught my\r\ntrain. Having admired him so long from afar, I was glad to have had this\r\nbrief contact, even though he was unable to attend the Conference.\r\n\r\nI was back in New York by the end of October, and soon came a letter\r\nfrom Shaw cheering me with his point of view:\r\n\r\n  Birth control should be advocated for its own sake, on the general\r\n  ground that the difference between voluntary, irrational,\r\n  uncontrolled activity is the difference between an amoeba and a man;\r\n  and if we really believe that the more highly evolved creature is\r\n  the better we may as well act accordingly. As the amoeba does not\r\n  understand birth control, it cannot abuse it, and therefore its\r\n  state may be the more gracious; but it is also true that as the\r\n  amoeba cannot write, it cannot commit forgery: yet we teach\r\n  everybody to write unhesitatingly, knowing that if we refuse to\r\n  teach anything that could be abused we should never teach anything\r\n  at all.\r\n\r\nInterminable correspondence began immediately with adherents and, in\r\nmany distant lands, possible delegates. I sent out telegrams to the\r\nformer and as fast as money arrived dispatched it to the latter for\r\ntheir passage over, though I did not yet have enough to get them home\r\nagain. Languages and interpreters then had to be arranged for; in Europe\r\nthat was difficult enough, but here it was more than perplexing. Worst\r\nof all was the eternal barrier of our laws. Topics that could be freely\r\ndiscussed in London were forbidden in the United States, and we could\r\nnot afford to have the dignity of the occasion marred by another Town\r\nHall episode. I had to tell delegates what their papers were to be\r\nabout, and, when it was necessary to cut out a reference to\r\ncontraceptives, had to apologize and explain why.\r\n\r\nI quickly found that visitors from seventeen countries could produce\r\nmore problems than statistics and theories proved. The committee sent to\r\nmeet Dr. G. O. Lapouge, a French eugenist, after vainly searching\r\nthrough the cabins on the boat, went back to the pier whence all had\r\nfled save one inconspicuous, desolate man sitting on top of his luggage,\r\nreading, waiting patiently for someone to come for him—so\r\nunimportant-looking that no one would have suspected him of being a\r\nrenowned scientist. The next morning the Hotel McAlpin, where the\r\nconvention was to be held, called me up to report that Dr. Lapouge had\r\nbeen severely burned, and an interpreter was needed. Dr. Drysdale\r\nhurried off to find the poor little man of seventy in excruciating pain\r\nbut carrying on a dissertation, highly amusing, about the hazards of\r\nAmerica’s much-advertised plumbing. Without understanding how to\r\nregulate the shower he had stood under it and turned on the hot water.\r\nThe skin fairly peeled off his chest. Nevertheless, bandaged and oiled,\r\nhe undauntedly attended all the sessions.\r\n\r\nThe opening night we had a “pioneers’ dinner” over which Heywood Broun\r\npresided. The Danish Fru Thit Jensen, blond, vivacious, was to relate\r\nthe troubles she had had in arousing interest in her own country. She\r\nmade her address in English courageously enough, but it was evident at\r\nonce that someone slightly familiar with American slang had helped her\r\nout. She was describing a doctors’ meeting in Denmark and the first\r\nwords we heard were, “When I gave my greetings to those boneheads as I\r\nam to you—” We all burst into laughter because they seemed to apply to\r\nthe guests present. Her face remained sphinx-like in its determined\r\nimmobility; she halted for us to subside, then continued. Almost\r\nimmediately the dignified gathering went off again into a fresh peal.\r\nYou no sooner recovered from one shrieking convulsion than she made\r\nanother remark equally ludicrous. After each outbreak she paused\r\nresignedly before going on with her carefully prepared speech. The\r\nhilarity finally got out of hand, so whether the end was funny or not\r\nnobody knew or cared.\r\n\r\nAt every meeting Dr. Ferdinand Goldstein of Berlin, who was hard of\r\nhearing, sat in the front row. The mention of any phase of population,\r\non which he was an expert, brought him promptly to his feet. Standing\r\ndirectly in front of the speaker, he cupped his ear in order not to miss\r\na single word. The one discordant note occurred on the last day when the\r\ncommittee declined to embody in its program any endorsement of abortion.\r\nHe not only left the Conference but went back to Germany without saying\r\ngood-by to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian delegates were Johann Ferch and his wife, Betty. This\r\nViennese printer had become interested in birth control through setting\r\nup material on his linotype. He had informed himself of methods and in a\r\nshort time had several clinics started in Vienna. One morning when I\r\nfound them at breakfast in the dining room, great tears were rolling\r\ndown Mrs. Ferch’s face. I asked her what the trouble was and she said\r\nshe was weeping because the pot of coffee on the table, a simple bit of\r\nfood, cost thirty-five cents, and she realized what this amount of money\r\nwould buy at home; for the price of one meal in New York their starving\r\nrelatives could live for a whole day in luxury. Neither of them felt\r\nentitled to indulge in such extravagance.\r\n\r\nDr. Aletta Jacobs walked along with me after one of the sessions. She\r\nsaid the fact she had refused to see me in 1915 had been on her mind\r\never since, and she desired to clear up the matter now; she had always\r\nbeen against lay people taking part in the movement, and for that reason\r\nhad opposed the Rutgers method of training practical nurses and allowing\r\nthem to go out in the field after only two months’ instruction. She had\r\nput me in the same category as those in her own country who had wanted\r\nto establish clinics as a commercial venture. That afternoon she visited\r\nour clinic and went over methods with Dr. Cooper and Dr. Stone. Here,\r\nshe said, with kindling eyes, was the system she had envisioned in the\r\nNetherlands but had never been able to make come true.\r\n\r\nThe eugenists were given their opportunity to speak at the Conference.\r\nEugenics, which had started long before my time, had once been defined\r\nas including free love and prevention of conception. Moses Harman of\r\nChicago, one of its chief early adherents, had run a magazine and gone\r\nto jail for it under the Comstock regime. Recently it had cropped up\r\nagain in the form of selective breeding, and biologists and geneticists\r\nsuch as Clarence C. Little, President of the University of Maine, and C.\r\nB. Davenport, Director of the Cold Spring Harbor Station for\r\nExperimental Evolution, had popularized their findings under this\r\nheading. Protoplasm was the substance then supposed to carry on\r\nhereditary traits—genes and chromosomes were a later discovery.\r\nProfessor Davenport used to lift his eyes reverently and, with his hands\r\nupraised as though in supplication, quiver emotionally as he breathed,\r\n“Protoplasm. We want more protoplasm.”\r\n\r\nI accepted one branch of this philosophy, but eugenics without birth\r\ncontrol seemed to me a house built upon sands. It could not stand\r\nagainst the furious winds of economic pressure which had buffeted into\r\npartial or total helplessness a tremendous proportion of the human race.\r\nThe eugenists wanted to shift the birth control emphasis from less\r\nchildren for the poor to more children for the rich. We went back of\r\nthat and sought first to stop the multiplication of the unfit. This\r\nappeared the most important and greatest step towards race betterment.\r\n\r\nA special round table for the eugenists was held at which we took the\r\nopportunity to challenge their theories. I said, “Dr. Little, let’s\r\nbegin with you. How many children have you?”\r\n\r\n“Three.”\r\n\r\n“How many more are you going to have?”\r\n\r\n“None. I can’t afford them.”\r\n\r\n“Professor East, how many have you, and how many more are you going to\r\nhave?”\r\n\r\nAnd so the question circled. Not one planned to have another child,\r\nthough Dr. Little has had two since by a second wife. “There you are,” I\r\nsaid, “a super-intelligent group, the very type for whom you advocate\r\nmore children, yet you yourselves won’t practice what you preach. If I\r\nwere to put this same question to a group of poor women who already have\r\nfamilies, every one of them would also answer, ‘No, I don’t want any\r\nmore.’ No arguments can make people want children if they think they\r\nhave enough.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Conference was over, a final meeting was held at my apartment\r\nto form a permanent international association of which Dr. Little was\r\nmade president.\r\n\r\nHandling everything had been something of an undertaking, but after all\r\nthe delegates had been sent off we still had money in the bank. My faith\r\nhad been justified that, if you started something worth while, means for\r\nits realization would be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Thirty-one_\r\n\r\n                      GREAT HEIGHTS ARE HAZARDOUS\r\n\r\n                 “_Professor East, though you may try,\r\n                 You fail to rouse my fears,\r\n                 For I don’t dream that even I\r\n                 Will live a hundred years;\r\n                 But do not think I view with mirth\r\n                 Five billion folk (assorted)\r\n                 Five billion tightly packed on earth\r\n                 Who cannot be supported._”\r\n                               (South African Review)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the New York Conference I thought that I was never\r\ngoing to have anything to do with organizing another. But hardly more\r\nthan a few months had gone by before my mind was dwelling on one to be\r\ncentered around overpopulation as a cause of war. From the statements of\r\nKeynes and the specialists of the League of Nations, and from the status\r\nof the countries of Europe, it was inferred that international peace\r\ncould in no way be made secure until measures had been put into effect\r\nto deal with explosive populations.\r\n\r\nBetween 1800 and 1900 the inhabitants of the world doubled in spite of\r\nbloody wars, thus proving they were only temporary checks. For every\r\nhundred thousand babies who died between dawn and dawn, Professor East\r\nestimated that one hundred and fifty thousand were born. These fifty\r\nthousand survivors contributed to the globe in twenty years a horde\r\nalmost equal to India’s three hundred and seventy-five million.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, numerically speaking, overpopulation was not of\r\napparent importance; we still had unoccupied lands. But evidence that we\r\nwere beginning to consider the quality of our citizens as well as the\r\nquantity was shown in our immigration laws. In 1907 we had barred aliens\r\nwith mental, physical, communicable, or loathsome diseases, and also\r\nilliterate paupers, prostitutes, criminals, and the feeble-minded. Had\r\nthese precautions been taken earlier our institutions would not now be\r\ncrowded with moronic mothers, daughters, and grand-daughters—three\r\ngenerations at a time, all of whom have to be supported by tax-payers\r\nwho shut their eyes to this condition, admittedly detrimental to the\r\nblood stream of the race.\r\n\r\nThen our sudden closing of the doors in 1924 by placing the world on a\r\nquota, threw Europe’s surplus population back on herself. Italy had to\r\nface this problem as Germany had had to do in 1914. At the Institute of\r\nPolitics in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1925, Count\r\nAntonio Cippico, Fascist Senator, virtually demanded that, to make room\r\nfor her “explosive expansion,” Italy be allowed to export her\r\nhalf-million annual increase to foreign lands. Professor East answered\r\nhim, asking Italy first to put her house in order, and setting forth\r\nwith clarity the inexorable results of “spawning children on the world\r\nwith haphazard recklessness.” But she had no intention of doing so.\r\nShortly afterwards Mussolini outlined his plan: “If Italy is to amount\r\nto anything it must enter into the second half of this century with at\r\nleast sixty million.”\r\n\r\nJapan and Germany as well as Italy were already called danger spots in\r\n1925. Japan’s goal was a hundred million. Göring was soon to say, “The\r\nterritory in which the Germans live is too small for our sixty-six\r\nmillion inhabitants and will be too small for the ninety million which\r\nwe want to become.” The three military countries were pleading with\r\ntheir women to bear more children, offering as inducements medals,\r\nmoney, lands. They claimed the right of expansion because they were too\r\ncrowded at home, and were at the same time increasing their peoples in\r\norder to promote successful wars.\r\n\r\nPopulations can fall into a semi-starved state of inertia, such as that\r\nof India or China, unless they are aggressive. They have a choice of\r\nthree courses: to lower the standards of living to the bare subsistence\r\nlevel, to control the birth rate, or to reach out for colonies as Great\r\nBritain has done.\r\n\r\nWhile we had been holding our conference in London in 1922 I had met at\r\none of Major Putnam’s luncheons the Very Reverend “gloomy” Dean Inge,\r\nexcept that he was not gloomy at all; he was full of mischief. In his\r\nlate fifties, tall, thin as an exclamation point, quite deaf, he\r\nreminded me of a Dickens character. He had commented in his usual\r\npungent style on the real meaning of the right to expand:\r\n\r\n  It is a pleasant prospect if every nation with a high birth rate has\r\n  a “right” to exterminate its neighbors. The supposed duty of\r\n  multiplication, and the alleged right to expand, are among the chief\r\n  causes of modern war; and I repeat that if they justify war, it must\r\n  be a war of extermination, since mere conquest does nothing to solve\r\n  the problem.\r\n\r\nI was still of the opinion in 1925 that the League of Nations should\r\ninclude birth control in its program and proclaim that increase in\r\nnumbers was not to be regarded as a justifiable reason for national\r\nexpansion, but that each nation should limit its inhabitants to its\r\nresources as a fundamental principle of international peace.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was all very well to say, “Cut down your numbers,”\r\nbut how could this be done if scientific and medical development lagged\r\nso far behind that few knew how to do it? Building up huge populations\r\nby following the way of nature was fairly simple, but it was by no means\r\nsimple to reduce them again voluntarily. No long-range program was\r\npossible until economists, sociologists, and biologists alike should\r\ngarner and contribute facts to the solution. Therefore the occasion was\r\nnow ripe for the attention of the scientific world to be focused on the\r\npopulation question. I planned to bring them together at Geneva, the\r\nlogical meeting place.\r\n\r\nDr. Little, who had accepted the presidency for the next international\r\nbirth control conference, had gone to the University of Michigan as its\r\nPresident. He had no time for organizing, raising money, getting\r\nspeakers; if this lengthy job of organizing the World Population\r\nConference were to be done I should have to do it.\r\n\r\nSo great was the competition between the League of Nations and other\r\ngroups desiring to hold conventions at Geneva during its sessions that\r\nyou had to book an auditorium and rooms for delegates practically twelve\r\nmonths ahead. Consequently, towards the end of 1926 I went to Geneva to\r\nmake arrangements for an expected three hundred guests. I had previously\r\nbecome acquainted with several Genevese. William Rappard, then a\r\nprofessor at the university there, consented to go on our committee and\r\nadvise me on social details with which only a native would be familiar.\r\n\r\nMore vital to me was the Labor Office of the League, where it was not a\r\nmatter of politics but of industrial problems thrashed out by people\r\nchosen for their special knowledge. Here I met Albert Thomas, a\r\nstrange-looking person, short, stocky, with black beard sprouting over\r\nhis face, very talkative, amazing in his energy, traveling over Europe\r\nby night, arriving in Geneva in the morning, conducting his business\r\naffairs, making speeches. But with all this activity he managed to spare\r\nhours enough to help me immeasurably when I consulted him on subjects,\r\npersons, locations, and dates.\r\n\r\nThe Salle Centrale was engaged for three days, August 30th to September\r\n2nd of the next year, 1927. Back I went to London to enlist an English\r\ncommittee. Clinton Chance became my husband’s assistant in supervising\r\nfinances, and also provided London headquarters in his offices,\r\nsupplying stenographers and secretaries. Edith How-Martyn joined us and\r\nI secured the invaluable aid of Julian Huxley, brother of Aldous, a\r\nbrilliant, young, enthusiastic scientist, alive and having a mind that\r\nnot only took things in, but gave them out. The Conference owed much to\r\nhis fair and just opinions and the fine supporters he rounded up.\r\nTogether we went over names and names and names, trying to choose a\r\nchairman of sufficient distinction around whom European scientists would\r\nrally. Professor A. M. Carr-Saunders at first accepted, but a month and\r\na half later informed me his other obligations were so heavy he would\r\nhave to limit his participation to membership on the Council.\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of uncertainty, interviews, and rejections, we selected Sir\r\nBernard Mallet, K.C.B., once of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Board of\r\nInland Revenue, later Registrar General of Births, Deaths, and\r\nMarriages, and President of the Royal Statistical Society. Although very\r\nEnglish, he was not too conservative. He knew well Sir Eric Drummond,\r\nthen head of the League of Nations, and also had many friends on the\r\nContinent, particularly in Italy. He was typical of an individual who\r\nhad climbed far, who knew where he was going and the road by which he\r\nshould travel. Bored at being now in retirement, he accepted our offer\r\nwillingly because, although no salary was attached, it would give him a\r\nposition and an interest, and keep him socially in touch with noteworthy\r\nfigures. Lady Mallet’s previous experience as lady-in-waiting to Queen\r\nVictoria made her an expert hostess, and this too we needed.\r\n\r\nOnce I had to make an expedition all the way to Edinburgh to seek out\r\nDr. F. A. E. Crew, a shining light among the younger biologists, who was\r\nmaking hens crow and roosters lay eggs. He readily agreed to come to the\r\nConference and during the two days I visited him helped me build up my\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nI also wanted a paper read by André Siegfried, author of _America Comes\r\nof Age_, written after journeying some six weeks through the United\r\nStates. When he invited me to tea at his home in Paris, I found him in\r\nappearance more like a mixture of American and English than French. But\r\nyou could feel from his attitude and deduce from his conversation that\r\nhe really envied, despised, hated Americans; by invading France with our\r\n“wealth and vulgarity,” we had utterly spoiled it for his compatriots.\r\nAppreciating good food, which we never had at home, we squandered\r\nenormously, four or five times what they did. The same was true of wine;\r\nwe were drinking their best, paying high for it without being able to\r\ntell the difference when we were given cheap vintages. Consequently, the\r\nParisians were being shut out of Paris because they could not afford the\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how you can blame the Americans for coming over and paying\r\nwhat you French ask,” I replied. “You might have a complaint perhaps if\r\nwe tried to undersell you or refused to buy. But it seems to me you are\r\nprofiting considerably by this ‘outrageous intrusion of the American\r\ndollar.’”\r\n\r\nAlthough we did not get on very well and although he would not read a\r\npaper, he consented to attend.\r\n\r\nSome of the preliminaries having been set, my husband took a villa at\r\nCap d’Ail between Nice and Monte Carlo and near enough to Geneva, Paris,\r\nand London for trips whenever necessary. From my room the sunrise was\r\nincredibly vivid—reds and yellows mixed with the glorious blue of the\r\nMediterranean. But it was not warm. H.G., who had a villa at Grasse,\r\nsaid the Riviera reputation for summer heat in wintertide was a fraud.\r\nWe used to drive up to see him; the flowers for the perfume\r\nmanufactories grew thick on the hillsides, so thick that the air for\r\nmiles around was fragrant. Occasionally we picnicked in the tiny village\r\non top of the mountain of Ez, a favorite haunt of artists. Once the old\r\ncastle had belonged to robber barons, who could see for miles the\r\napproach of a ship; now the elder Mrs. O. P. Belmont had a palatial\r\nresidence there.\r\n\r\nThe Riviera was always a Mecca for English people wanting to escape\r\ntheir own cold and fog and damp, and our eight guest rooms were full\r\nmost of the time. It was quite novel for me to manage a household in\r\nFrench. We had the traditional bad luck of Americans; the maids stole\r\nfrom the guests and the hot water boiler only held ten gallons—not a\r\nperson could have a good bath until a modern one was installed. My first\r\ncook was an expert in her field, but I soon found she was running over\r\nin her bills, even allowing for the customary perquisite of a sou for\r\neach franc she spent with the butcher and the greengrocer. Eggs and\r\nbutter were on the list every day, but never how many eggs nor how much\r\nbutter. I laid the responsibility on my own bad French, before I\r\ndiscovered it was her understanding of Americans. Then and there I told\r\nher she had to leave the following day immediately after breakfast. She\r\nreceived this ultimatum with tears and wailing. Somewhat uneasy I rose\r\nearly at seven only to find she had gone late the preceding night,\r\ntaking with her every scrap of food in the pantry and storeroom except\r\nthe salt.\r\n\r\nOn one of my frequent flittings to London I went to a hairdressers’\r\nshop, unfamiliar to me but carrying the insignia of reliability, “By\r\nAppointment to Her Majesty.” I was to return to Cap d’Ail in a few days\r\nand wished to appear with a wave in my hair, which I wore Mid-Victorian,\r\nvery sweet and simple. After washing it, the coiffeur put an iron on a\r\nlittle gas arrangement in the window near by and left the room while it\r\nwas drying, floating out in the wind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I meditated on the subject of hair. The story of Samson seemed\r\nto have been more than an allegorical tale. I could tell from the way\r\nmine acted on being brushed in the morning how I myself was going to be.\r\nIf it were strong and electric, then I was full of vitality. When\r\nslumped over my forehead so that it had to be tied down, then I dragged\r\nabout spiritlessly.\r\n\r\nIt was also interesting to analyze why a woman should wear her hair in a\r\ncertain style. I knew some who, at the age of sixty, curled theirs in\r\nbaby ringlets; doubtless something within them wanted never to grow up.\r\nWomen who had gone into the underground movement in Russia took the\r\nshears to theirs so that nothing should divert the attention to feminine\r\nappeal. I was not enough of a Feminist to sacrifice mine, but I had once\r\ncome to the conclusion that the triumph of life would be to push it\r\nstraight back from my forehead and tie it in a knot behind, because that\r\nwas how people thought I looked. But I could not do it. No matter what\r\nwas said about your feet or your figure, you could at least show your\r\nhair—in front of hats, down your back, everywhere, and so I had clung\r\ntenaciously to my long locks.\r\n\r\nAt this point in my musings I smelled something burning and turned\r\naround to find half my hair singed off to my ear. I gave one shriek, and\r\nthe whole staff rushed in. But it was too late; it all had to be cut\r\nshort and I actually wept.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I reached Paris I had what was left done up like a switch so\r\nthat I could put it on if I felt too badly. I kept it in a box, all\r\nready in case my husband did not want me without my hair. Eventually I\r\nhad to face his disapproval. I appeared for dinner. Nothing was said.\r\nAlthough internally amused the guests maintained grave faces, waiting\r\nfor him to notice it; not until next morning did he do so. My own\r\nattitude had changed overnight; never did I want to return to long hair.\r\n\r\nDuring early spring, just when it was beginning to be most beautiful, I\r\ncould spend little time at Cap d’Ail. Permanent headquarters were\r\nestablished in April at Geneva—four airy, spacious rooms up two flights.\r\nI had expected Edith How-Martyn to be with me, but she came down with\r\nscarlet fever in London. It was a complication to do without her until\r\nMrs. Marjorie Martin, who had organized a pool of stenographers,\r\nsecretaries, and typists at the Labor Bureau, furnished us with a most\r\ncompetent and experienced office staff of seventeen.\r\n\r\nAt four-thirty our large reception room was transformed into a living\r\nroom where all the employees and volunteers gathered. Each in turn\r\nprovided cakes, brewed the tea, and washed up afterwards. One evening at\r\na quarter to seven some good American stopped in and, seeing everybody\r\nsmiling and cheerful though still at work, asked, “Will you tell me what\r\nmagic you women use to create this atmosphere? You’ve been at it since\r\nseven this morning.”\r\n\r\nThe answer was—tea at four-thirty.\r\n\r\nI liked being in Geneva, neat and clean and filled with watch shops. I\r\ndid not even mind the great numbers of people in solemn, black clothes.\r\nIf anyone died in this Calvinist city, the family wore full mourning for\r\none year, and half for the following—in large families the process\r\nbecame almost perpetual.\r\n\r\nI was not stimulated by the League sittings. There was much reading of\r\npapers and a lot of noise, but no breathless excitement during the\r\ndebates. Instead, the members talked in small groups, looking very\r\nbored. The big things, just as in Washington, were done behind the\r\nscenes, at dinner tables, and in private conferences. The general\r\nmeetings were merely sounding boards for public opinion. One of the most\r\ninteresting features was the way a delegate could make a speech in his\r\nown language and others at their desks could plug in earphones and hear\r\nit simultaneously in theirs, coming from booths off stage.\r\n\r\nDelegates to our Conference were all asking whether their papers were to\r\nbe given in their respective tongues. I came to one swift decision—to\r\nadopt the bilingual League precedent of French and English. It was\r\nsimple enough to secure interpreters who were familiar with political\r\nterminology, because they swarmed at Geneva, but to find those who\r\nunderstood scientific terms in German, Italian, Hungarian, Scandinavian,\r\nPortuguese, Greek, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese was quite another\r\naffair. We tried to catch as many as we could passing through Geneva and\r\nhold them over during the time we needed their services.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate matters my husband generously financed the\r\nmorning journal to be delivered on the breakfast tray of every person\r\nregistered at the Conference, and also to members of the League of\r\nNations. It was printed in English and French in parallel columns,\r\ncontaining the papers, the discussions, and any news items that might\r\nconcern the delegates.\r\n\r\nEntertainment was an important feature. A series of luncheons was to be\r\nheld at the Restaurant Besson, with a host at each table, and daily the\r\nseating was to be rearranged so that each guest might be placed between\r\nthose who spoke his own language or languages. M. Rappard was to give a\r\nreception. M. Fatio invited us on board the _Montreux_ to visit Mme. de\r\nStaël’s former home at Coppet. The chief social event was the reception\r\nand dinner at Mrs. Stanley McCormick’s Fifteenth Century Château de\r\nPrangins at Nyon. She herself could not be there, but sent a\r\nrepresentative from America to open it, equip it with servants, and make\r\neverything ready.\r\n\r\nAdequate handling of publicity was essential, and Albin Johnson,\r\ncorrespondent of the New York _World_, did this for me. He knew who was\r\nwho, whom to avoid, and what persons would put the proper emphasis on\r\nwhat. He volunteered his services, but some of his assistants had to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nWe offered expenses to all speakers and certain visitors who might later\r\nbe influential in their own communities. The outpouring of money was\r\nconstant and I was not getting enough by soliciting from wealthy\r\nindividuals. Consequently, giving up the villa in May, I came back to\r\nthe United States to secure some from a foundation.\r\n\r\nBy now I knew I should be gone for at least another year, and someone\r\nhad to take charge during my absence. The woman on our Board of\r\nDirectors who seemed to be the most selflessly devoted, giving time and\r\neffort without stint, able to speak and to direct, was Mrs. F.\r\nRobertson-Jones. She went to meetings in blizzard or rainstorm, by\r\nsubway or on foot if necessary. No dressmaker, no friend dropping in to\r\nlunch kept her from her job. But she differed from me in one respect.\r\nShe could not run things unless she felt secure; she wanted a definite\r\nsigning on the dotted line for so much annually instead of voluntary\r\ncontributions of what people felt they could afford when they could\r\nafford it. This was quite against the spirit on which the movement had\r\nalways proceeded, but I was willing to compromise. I did not then\r\nrealize how serious it was going to prove in the future to have ceded\r\nthis fundamental precept. She accepted the temporary presidency and I\r\nsailed back, reaching Geneva in July.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at the rising tide of international solidarity which, in\r\nthis non-industrial city, evidenced itself in astonishing fashion the\r\nnight Sacco and Vanzetti were to be electrocuted. I had been working\r\nlate at the office and when I came out towards midnight the crowds in\r\nthe streets were so dense I could hardly move. As soon as word came in\r\nthe early morning that the execution had not been stayed, they shouted\r\nreproaches before the houses of Americans, smashed the windows of the\r\nUnited States Consulate, and some in the League building. Even in front\r\nof the Hôtel des Bergues, where we were stopping, they clamored their\r\nprotests.\r\n\r\nThe great Dr. William Welch of Johns Hopkins was in Geneva at this time,\r\na cheerful person, roly-poly, abounding in fun and sly, acute remarks.\r\nTo listen to his unimpressive conversation you would never suspect that\r\nhere was one whose name was known around the world. We had lunch\r\ntogether one noon. He knew how much I was depending on the Conference,\r\nhow much I was hoping that the population aspect of birth control should\r\nbe started in the right direction and under the right auspices. He\r\nwalked a little way with me and then, putting his arm across my\r\nshoulders, said, “Perhaps you think your battles are over, but they\r\naren’t.”\r\n\r\nI felt he was trying to prepare me for something having gone wrong,\r\nthough I could not imagine what it was. From then on I was aware of an\r\nunpleasant subterranean mystery insidiously disturbing the previous\r\nharmony. But nobody talked openly.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence in the United States, Sir Bernard had been collecting\r\nhis European friends. Not only was Italy intent on increasing her\r\npopulation, but the reactionary element of France also had formed a\r\nsociety to combat birth control. We had invited the Italians, Guglielmo\r\nFerrero and Gaetano Salvemini, but Sir Bernard had been induced to\r\naccept as a substitute Corrado Gini, who, dark, swarthy, highly\r\negotistical, speaking English painfully, was the perfect mirror of\r\nMussolini’s sentiments, and turned out to be a most tiresome speaker and\r\na general nuisance.\r\n\r\nThe delegates, Gini among the first, began to gather late in August. The\r\nstorm broke the Friday before our scheduled opening Tuesday, August\r\n31st. Proofs of the official program had just come to me for my\r\napproval. Sir Bernard came into my office and looked at them. “Well,\r\nwe’ll just cross these off,” he said, drawing his pencil through my name\r\nand those of my assistants.\r\n\r\n“Why are you doing that?”\r\n\r\n“The names of the workers should not be included on scientific\r\nprograms.”\r\n\r\n“These people are different,” I objected. “In their particular lines\r\nthey are as much experts as the scientists.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter. They can’t go on. Out of the question. It’s not\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nA long cry of dismay went up from the staff. They considered the action\r\nreprehensible and petty. The young woman who was to deliver the program\r\nto the printers would not do so. Saturday morning, secretaries and\r\ntypists—twenty-one altogether—struck in a body, and without them the\r\nConference could not proceed successfully.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Little was trying his powers of persuasion on them, I reported\r\nthe situation to Sir Bernard, saying that in justice to the women who\r\nhad given so generously of their time and effort, who had raised the\r\nmoney, issued the invitations, paid the delegates’ expenses, they should\r\nbe given proper credit. All the latter had had to do was walk in at the\r\nlast moment, present their papers, and take part in the social life\r\nplanned for them.\r\n\r\nHaving registered my sentiments, I spent most of Sunday convincing the\r\nmembers of the staff that the Conference was bigger than their own hurt\r\nfeelings and making them promise to return; Edith How-Martyn, however,\r\nwho had joined me some time before, refused to continue because the hard\r\nlabor of the workers was not to be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThough suspecting that the elimination of my name was the crux of the\r\nmatter, I was still at a loss to know the exact reason back of this\r\ntempest until one of the delegates told me the story. Sir Eric Drummond\r\nhad warned Sir Bernard that these distinguished scientists would be the\r\nlaughing stock of all Europe if it were known that a woman had brought\r\nthem together. Hence, in order to influence Italian and French delegates\r\nto attend, Sir Bernard had secretly pledged that I was not to be a party\r\nto the Conference and no discussion of birth control or Malthusianism\r\nwould be allowed. He had hoped that the whole thing might be muddled\r\nthrough, and, when the delegates had come drifting in, had gone from one\r\nto another to urge, “I ask you to stand by me; do not let me down.”\r\n\r\nOnly our young English friends had held out for the recognition of the\r\nwomen. I was not surprised at the Europeans; but it was difficult to\r\ncomprehend the American attitude on this point. Perhaps Professor Pearl\r\nand Dr. Little, in agreeing to support Sir Bernard, had not realised the\r\nunfairness of the action. Clarence Little was as honest a human being as\r\nyou could find, but sometimes I thought his personal allegiances\r\nobstructed his vision; he used his intelligence to make up arguments on\r\nthe side of loyalty rather than on the side of principles.\r\n\r\nAt the hour designated the first meeting opened in the Salle Centrale.\r\nEach delegate had a number of extra tickets, and with the German,\r\nBelgian, and French contingents came several gentlemen with large silver\r\ncrosses hanging down outside their coats. In the lobby a Genevese book\r\nconcern had been permitted to set up a table for the sale of volumes by\r\ndelegates. These guests immediately demanded of Sir Bernard that a\r\ncertain one, of which they disapproved, be banished. Sir Bernard trotted\r\nto me and said he wished no trouble; there seemed to be some\r\ncontroversy. Would I have the offending books taken away?\r\n\r\nI approached the strangers and asked who they were. They vociferated in\r\nvarious languages, shaking the book under my nose, getting red in the\r\nface, looking as though apoplexy might smite them. I sent for an\r\ninterpreter and instructed him to say, “The hall will be for rent next\r\nMonday. Meantime, I have paid for it and will suffer no dictation from\r\nanybody as to what shall be done here.”\r\n\r\nThe disturbers did not depart, and the excitement around the bookstand\r\nwas so considerable that the volumes were sold out and more had to be\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the Conference the Americans, British, and\r\nScandinavians admitted the need for limiting population; the Germans and\r\nCzechs concurred, although with less assurance; the Italian and Slav\r\nvoices were definitely opposed; the French, who practiced it at home,\r\npreached against it publicly. The papers of Professors East and\r\nFairchild came perilously near mentioning the forbidden word\r\nMalthusianism, but as for birth control, it was edged about like a bomb\r\nwhich might explode any moment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the three days a permanent population union was formed\r\nwhich is still meeting—the only international group dealing with the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAll the brilliant committee now took trains and steamed off for home,\r\nleaving me with the bills, the clearing up, and, most important of all,\r\nthe editing of the proceedings. After a rest at a sanitorium at Glion in\r\nSwitzerland I set to work, and by the end of November they had gone to\r\npress. I wanted to visit India but had to think of this trip in terms of\r\nphysical fitness and, consequently, was obliged to forego it. Instead, I\r\naccepted an invitation sent me by Agnes Smedley on behalf of the\r\nAssociation of German Medical Women to lecture in Germany in December.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin of 1927 was far different from that of 1920. Food was\r\nplentiful, if expensive, the Adlon and other restaurants were crowded, a\r\nstirring of life and nationalism was everywhere to be sensed. At the\r\nappearance of a Zeppelin in the skies, men in the streets took off their\r\nhats as though it had been a god.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke in the Town Hall of Charlottenburg-Berlin I was reminded of\r\nthe birth strike German women had been carrying on when I had last been\r\nthere. German men seemed to have remembered little of this, still\r\nthinking they could keep their wives to childbearing, “their race\r\nfunction,” as it was called. But the women had now definitely directed\r\ntheir thoughts from race preservation to self-preservation. As I said to\r\nmy audience, “Birth control has always been practiced, beginning with\r\ninfanticide, which is abhorred, and then by abortion, nearly as bad.\r\nContraception, on the other hand, is harmless.”\r\n\r\nAlmost before I had finished Dr. Alfred Grotjahn, Professor of Social\r\nHygiene at the University of Berlin, who was seeking to present the\r\npicture of Germany’s future greatness in terms of numbers, shouted out\r\nthat every woman ought to have three children before she should be\r\nallowed contraceptive information. No sooner had he resumed his seat\r\nthan several women were demanding recognition. I was told one of them\r\nwas Dr. Marthe Ruben-Wolf. “She’s a Communist. What she’s saying is all\r\non your side, but it won’t do any good, because nobody has ever been\r\nable to cope with Grotjahn.” Nevertheless, she answered him figure for\r\nfigure, fact for fact, each based on her experience, adding that his\r\npatriotism was only skin deep. He might as well bury himself now; he\r\nwould soon be buried by the rising generation and forgotten.\r\n\r\nThen a huge shape arose, garbed in uniform and bonnet. I thought she\r\nmust be a deaconess, but she turned out to be President of the Midwives\r\nAssociation. She bellowed in tones even louder than those of Grotjahn,\r\nputting herself on record against birth control. She could not be\r\nstopped; she would not sit down even when the bell was rung. Others\r\nanswered her—the debate developed into a regular bear garden before the\r\ncontestants were separated and removed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the meeting some twenty women physicians gathered at my\r\nhotel two evenings later. Clinics were to be established at Neuköln\r\nunder Dr. Kurt Bendix, the health administrator of the section; for the\r\nfirst time in history a government agency was actually sanctioning birth\r\ncontrol. I promised fifty dollars a month for three years towards\r\nsupplies; the doctors agreed to furnish rooms and medical services. They\r\nhad a more Feminist point of view than ours in the United States; Ellen\r\nKey’s liberal influence had seeped through from Scandinavia.\r\nNevertheless, I was astonished that in the very country where we were\r\npurchasing our contraceptives, these outstanding members of their\r\nprofession knew practically nothing about them. The original clinic was\r\nopened the following May and for five years contraceptive information\r\nwas given in a dozen places under medical supervision. Then the Nazis\r\ncame into power, they were closed, and Dr. Bendix committed suicide.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the month I went to Frankfurt-am-Main where Dr.\r\nHerthe Riese was managing one of the largest of the marriage advice\r\nbureaus, of which there were about fifteen hundred in Germany. Anyone\r\ncould apply to these for legal information and, for example, receive\r\nenlightenment as to who should have custody of a child if illegitimate,\r\nthe amount of alimony to be paid by the husband in case of divorce, the\r\nnationality of a child if the father were a foreigner, the effect of\r\nsterilization, the results of the marriage of cousins, or any problem,\r\nincluding homosexuality and inversion, feeblemindedness and abortion.\r\n\r\nIn this period of great unemployment, bearing particularly heavily upon\r\nfamilies with many children, Dr. Riese had gone to the officers of one\r\nof the big health insurance companies and persuaded them that it would\r\nbe economical for them to underwrite sterilization of women carrying\r\nhealth insurance if this were advised by a doctor. I saw her order\r\nseventy-five of these major operations one evening between six o’clock\r\nand eight-thirty in her own clinic. Professor Grotjahn had created\r\nalmost a slogan by his demand that in order to bolster up the falling\r\nbirth rate every wife have three children. But the women had a counter\r\nslogan; they came in saying, “I’ve had my three. I want an operation.” I\r\nsaw also some who had returned from the hospital to report. They\r\nappeared happy and proud and pleased with themselves. Their ten days or\r\ntwo weeks in bed had meant food and much-needed rest.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany I went vacationing to St. Moritz, to play, to skate, to\r\nski, in that glorious high altitude. It was transcendently beautiful. I\r\nused to get up in the morning and listen to the sleighs coming up the\r\nhill with their tinkling bells, and look out at the scintillating snow;\r\nevery twig of every tree was encased in ice on which the sun glistened\r\nwithout melting it. The scene was a white etching.\r\n\r\nSt. Moritz was much frequented by nobility and royalty on holiday.\r\nWhenever one of them arrived, like a flock of birds the hangers-on\r\nwinged their way thither, settled down in all the hotels so that\r\nordinary folk could scarcely find room.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first person I met was Lady Astor, more British than the\r\nBritish themselves, the Southern accent entirely gone. Her blond hair\r\nwas turned sand-colored, her blue eyes were always gay, her tanned and\r\nrugged features sharp, mouth and jaw firm set, neck clean cut. She was\r\nquick-tempered and frank, and ready to take fire easily. Lord Astor, who\r\nwas devoted to his wife, was much more politically astute, and usually\r\nwent campaigning with her. He sat directly behind her, and, when the\r\nheckling began or a question was posed which might involve her in\r\ndifficulties, he called out in a stage whisper, “Don’t be drawn, Nancy,\r\ndon’t be drawn!”\r\n\r\nDuring one House of Commons debate, Lady Astor had attempted to drive\r\nhome a point by stating she was the mother of five children and\r\ntherefore ought to know.\r\n\r\nHer opponent, taking issue with her, had jumped up, saying his word\r\nshould carry more weight on the subject because he was the father of\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nLady Astor then retorted, “But I haven’t finished yet.”\r\n\r\nThe British professed to be horrified at this—so vulgar and American!\r\n\r\nOnce after Lady Astor had been off skiing all day, I joined her in her\r\nroom shortly before dinner. She was sitting up in bed, the windows wide\r\nopen, cold cream smeared over her sunburned face, her glasses on her\r\nnose, reading _Science and Health_ with the Bible near by. She had not\r\nquite ended her day’s lesson.\r\n\r\nAlmost wherever I am, the subject of birth control comes up sooner or\r\nlater, and it did on this occasion. Lady Astor seemed to think her\r\nreligion forbade her believing in it. “If they want babies, let them\r\nhave babies. If they don’t want them, let them practice continence.”\r\n\r\n“Even accepting that continence is the ultimate ideal,” I replied,\r\n“wouldn’t you agree that contraception as an immediate necessity to help\r\nmillions of women is of equal importance with wearing glasses to read\r\nthe Bible? As a good Christian Scientist you should not use them. Until\r\nyou get enough faith to go without, don’t you think it better to read\r\nMary Baker Eddy through some such means as glasses than not at all?”\r\n\r\nIn one second she beamed. “You’re perfectly right. That’s only\r\nreasonable.”\r\n\r\nIf you present common-sense people with the premise that birth control\r\nis common sense, they will always react in a common-sense way. Lady\r\nAstor was a practical person, and from that time on she has been a\r\nfriend of the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Thirty-two_\r\n\r\n                       CHANGE IS HOPEFULLY BEGUN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a cause becomes more and more successful, the ideas of the people\r\nengaged in it are bound to change. While still at St. Moritz I had been\r\ngetting messages and letters about the disturbing situation in the\r\nAmerican Birth Control League. I cabled Frances Ackermann to take it in\r\nhand, but she replied she was unable to bring about a friendly solution.\r\n\r\nI found on my return after eighteen months that the tone of the movement\r\nhad altered. The machinery I had built up to be ready for any emergency\r\nwas marking time. An incident which occurred almost immediately was\r\nhighly indicative. During my absence the League had been invited to\r\nparticipate in the Parents’ Exhibition in the Grand Central Palace, and\r\nhad signed a contract for a certain space. The day before the opening\r\ncame a letter from Robert E. Simon, who was in charge, stating that\r\nWilliam O’Shea, Superintendent of Public Schools, threatened to remove\r\nthe Board of Education exhibit if ours were there, and he therefore\r\nrequested our withdrawal.\r\n\r\nWith time so short I asked an attorney to secure a court injunction to\r\nprevent our exclusion. But one member of the Board said no step should\r\nbe taken without the approval of all; a meeting should be called to\r\ndiscuss what course was to be adopted. I tried to reach various\r\nDirectors by telephone, but before I could gather a quorum it was too\r\nlate; the check which paid for our space had been sent back and the\r\nExhibition had opened. We were left out.\r\n\r\nObviously, the old aggressive spirit had been superseded by a\r\ndoctrinaire program of social activity; the League had settled down. I\r\nhad always believed that offerings should be voluntarily measured by the\r\nindividual’s desire. In this way you could appeal whenever a special\r\noccasion warranted and receive anywhere from one dollar to two or three\r\nhundred. Contributors were giving to something that concerned them\r\nvitally, and they did it, not because they had signed a pledge for a\r\nlimited sum, but because they wanted to help forward the movement. I\r\ncould not share the League’s enthusiasm over the fact that our bank\r\naccount had grown to sizeable proportions—thousands of dollars drawing\r\ninterest, though I admit it must have been a great relief to a Board\r\nwhose previous experience had been to hear wails from the President and\r\nTreasurer as to our needs for some new project.\r\n\r\nI knew the apathy which came from a fat bank balance. I knew also the\r\ntacit disapproval which would meet every suggestion to touch that\r\nprecious fund. But my policy had been to spend, not to save, when work\r\nought to be done. I discovered that subscribers to the _Review_ had not\r\nbeen informed it was time for them to renew their subscriptions, and\r\nthat, consequently, they had diminished from thirteen thousand to\r\ntwenty-five hundred. Accordingly I told the bookkeeper to give fifteen\r\nor twenty dollars to the clerk to pay for circularizing. She said she\r\ncould not do it; a bylaw had been made that nobody could direct the\r\noutlay of more than five dollars without a resolution passed by the\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nThere is doubtless a place for organizations that restrict their scope\r\nto the status quo. Most charities are like that—they live on securities,\r\ninstall as officers those who keep pace with but are never in advance of\r\ngeneral opinion. Two members of the Board, with League-of-Women-Voters\r\ntraining, saw the movement in the light of routine, annual membership\r\ndues and a budget, going through the same ritual year after year and\r\nremaining that way, performing a quiet service in the community. I\r\nlooked upon it as something temporary, something to sweep through, to be\r\ndone with and finished; it was merely an instrument for accomplishment.\r\nI wanted us to avail ourselves of every psychological event, to push\r\nahead until hospitals and public health agencies took over birth control\r\nas part of their regular program, which would end our function.\r\n\r\nRegretfully I found the League was to side-step the greatest and most\r\nfar-reaching opportunity yet offered it. It was logically equipped to\r\nenter the legislative field. But it wanted to progress state by state. I\r\nwas convinced action in the Federal sphere would be quicker and much\r\nbroader educationally, and that, furthermore, success there would\r\nprovide a precedent for the states.\r\n\r\nWhen you build an organization, you try to combine harmonious elements,\r\nbut you cannot tell what they will turn out to be until a certain\r\ninterval has elapsed. Some of these women were in the movement for\r\nreasons they themselves did not always understand. A few liked the\r\nsensation of being important and having personal attention; they were at\r\ntheir best in following an individual, yet I never felt they were doing\r\nit for me. The liberals who had started with me had never demanded a\r\nreward. What they gave was for the cause; they refused to work _for_\r\npeople; they worked _with_ them or not at all.\r\n\r\nMost movements go through the phase of being brought into the drawing\r\nroom. Those who disagreed with me believed the emphasis should be on\r\nsocial register membership, and argued that my associations had been\r\nradical. The answer was “Yes,” because the radicals alone had had the\r\nvision and the courage to support me in the early days. The women who\r\nwere raising objections now had only joined up after it had been safe to\r\ndo so. Moreover, they were, for the most part, New Yorkers, not all of\r\nwhom had even gone into neighboring states. Their attitude tended to be,\r\n“Never you mind the West; let the Empire State make the decisions.”\r\n\r\nThe conflict of views which reigned in various matters was based on\r\nlives and environments which had been vastly separated. The time of some\r\nof the members of the Board had to depend on what was left from other\r\nduties—husbands, children, servants, charities, church entertainments,\r\nshopping. To me the cause was not a hobby, not a mere filler in a whirl\r\nof many engagements, not something that could wait on this or that mood,\r\nbut a living inspiration. It came first in my waking consciousness and\r\nwas my last thought as I fell asleep at night.\r\n\r\nI was always willing to present my facts to experts and abide by their\r\nsuperior knowledge, and I gave every consideration to the suggestions of\r\nthe Board. But I was no paper president. Experience had given me a\r\njudgment which entitled me to a certain amount of freedom of action, and\r\nI could not well observe the dictates of people who did not know my\r\nsubject as well as I did.\r\n\r\nJune 12, 1928, I resigned the presidency of the League. Because the\r\nmajority of the Directors were against this, and because I wanted to\r\nmake it easier for Mrs. Robertson-Jones to take over, I stayed on the\r\nBoard and continued to edit the _Review_.\r\n\r\nBut the divergence of opinions rapidly crystallized in the next few\r\nmonths. This had to be pondered upon and wisely dealt with. The\r\nsituation was going to mean constant friction, and the League might\r\neasily disintegrate into a dying, static thing. In any event, internal\r\ndiscord was abhorrent. I began to ask myself whether I could pass over\r\nthe Review, which for eleven years had been a vital part of my own\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThen came a meeting at which the question of the editorship arose. For\r\nthe first time friend opposed friend. Three voted against me; the other\r\nnine were for me. But my mind was now made up. I could fight outside\r\nenemies but not those who had been my fellow-workers; I would give\r\ncomplete freedom to others in order to obtain a new freedom for myself.\r\nTherefore, I surrendered the _Review_ to the League as its private\r\nproperty. I have been sorry that this step was necessary, because the\r\nmagazine changed from being a national and international medium for the\r\nexpression of ideas and became merely a house organ. However, I trust\r\nthat some day it will be possible to broaden its scope of usefulness\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nThe clinic, which had recently been treated rather like an orphan, still\r\nremained intact. No one in the League had ever paid any attention to it,\r\nand the doctors on the committee had been too busy with their own\r\npractices. I felt it was my responsibility, and belonged to me\r\npersonally. It was an interesting angle on my own psychology. I did not\r\nregret the theoretical part of the movement going into other hands, but\r\nI would have been traitor to all that had been entrusted to me had I\r\nyielded the clinic to women who had shown themselves incapable of the\r\nunderstanding and sympathy required in its operation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distressing aspects of the impasse was that members of\r\nthe organization had to forswear one to choose another, and this I\r\nhated. Juliet Rublee, Frances Ackermann, and Mrs. Walter Timme came with\r\nme unhesitatingly. So, too, did Kate Hepburn, Mrs. Day, and Dr. William\r\nH. Garth, the only minister on the Board, a forthright man who always\r\nspoke his mind.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper was ready either to go with the clinic or keep on with the\r\nLeague in the field if I thought he could be of most use there. It\r\nseemed to me few in the country could fill his place in speaking to the\r\nprofession and, consequently, I advised him to continue with the latter.\r\n\r\nAnne Kennedy had been loyal, done her job well, served a valuable\r\npurpose. She asked whether I would approve her affiliating herself with\r\nthe Holland-Rantos Company. Someone was badly needed in the\r\nmanufacturing realm who was at one with our policies, who could help to\r\ninstill pride in quality into the contraceptive business. Although I\r\nknew she did not like the commercial atmosphere and it would be a\r\ndefinite sacrifice for her, it was an excellent choice, and I was sure\r\nthat any firm she was with would hold fast to ethical standards.\r\n\r\nMrs. Delafield called me up and I went to see her. “They’ve telephoned\r\nme three or four times this very day. I’ve refused to answer until I\r\ntalked with you. What do you want me to do?”\r\n\r\nI asked her a counter-question. “What do you want? You must go as your\r\nheart tells you.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” she replied, “I realize you will now require only\r\nprofessionals—doctors, nurses, social workers, people who know\r\npolitics—perhaps I could be of more use in the work with which I am\r\nfamiliar.”\r\n\r\nThus the matter was settled.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways by which the same goal may be reached, and as a rule\r\ndiverse ones must be tried out in order to find the best. I still\r\nbelieved we were all aiming towards this, although not seeing eye to eye\r\non procedure.\r\n\r\nI felt very decidedly that the future of the movement was like that of a\r\ngrowing child. You might guide its first faltering steps, but unless you\r\nlet it run and fall it never could develop its own strength. The younger\r\ngeneration might need a little pushing and prodding now and then, but I\r\nwas confident that eventually they were going to build toward a sound\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nAs things recede in time they become of less and less importance. One of\r\nmy absolute theories is that any movement which has been based on\r\nfreedom, as this had been, is like a live cell; there is a biology of\r\nideas as there is a biology of cells, and each goes through a process of\r\nevolution. The parent cell splits and the new entities in their turn\r\ndivide and divide again. Instead of indicating breakdown, it is a sign\r\nof health; endless energy is spent trying to keep together forces which\r\nshould be distinct. Each cell is fulfilling its mission in this\r\nseparation, which in point of fact is no separation at all. Cohesion is\r\nmaintained until in the end the whole is a vast mosaic cleaving together\r\nin union and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-three_\r\n\r\n                       OLD FATHER ANTIC, THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Fifth and Sixth Avenues, practically in the shadow of the gray\r\nmass of St. Francis Xavier’s College, was a shabby, brownstone building,\r\nNumber 46 West Fifteenth Street. After the two years of gathering\r\nstatistical histories at 104 Fifth Avenue we decided in 1925 the time\r\nhad come to expand, and moved to this second home of the Clinical\r\nResearch Bureau. It was next to an express agency, three steps down from\r\nthe street, which was generally lined with trucks since the section was\r\nthick with lofts, factories, and warehouses—not particularly attractive,\r\nbut inexpensive, and we had a happy Irish landlord who helped convert\r\nthe English basement into offices and reception rooms.\r\n\r\nThe clinic was a neighborly place where mothers could congregate. We\r\ntried to keep it home-like, so that they would not feel an atmosphere of\r\nsickness or disease. The patients were accorded just as much\r\nconsideration as a business house gave its clients, and not, as in many\r\ndoctors’ anterooms, made to wait indefinitely; they were usually nervous\r\nenough anyhow without having to endure added suspense. Moreover, they\r\nhad husbands and children to feed and care for, and every hour was\r\nprecious to them. As they increased, staff increased; two physicians\r\nwere always on hand. We shortly included the first floor, and finally\r\noccupied the three.\r\n\r\nAbout a year before we had changed our location Lord Buckmaster had\r\nintroduced in the august House of Lords the memorable resolution which\r\nwe had discussed when I had been last in England.\r\n\r\nRarely had such an eloquent voice been lifted for our cause:\r\n\r\n  I would appeal on behalf ... of the women upon whose bare backs\r\n  falls the untempered lash of the primeval curse declaring that “in\r\n  sorrow thou shalt bring forth children,” the women with the pride\r\n  and glory of their life broken and discrowned, and the flower of\r\n  motherhood turned into nothing but decaying weeds; and on behalf of\r\n  the children who are thrust into this world unwanted, unwelcomed,\r\n  uncherished, unsustained, the children who do not bring trailing\r\n  behind them clouds of glory but the taint of inherited disease, and\r\n  over whose heads there may hover for ever the haunting horror of\r\n  inherited madness; on behalf of them all I would appeal and as men\r\n  who believe in the great future of our race, I beg of you, I\r\n  earnestly entreat you, to support the motion that I seek to move.\r\n\r\n  It is said that these women whom we seek to benefit are so indolent,\r\n  so ignorant, so foolish that they will not come for the information.\r\n  It is not merely that they do come, but the people who make that\r\n  statement do that which men so often do—they overlook the women’s\r\n  side of the question. What to a man may be a mere triviality, an act\r\n  between a sleep and a sleep and forgotten in a moment, may bring to\r\n  the woman the terror of consequences that we cannot measure, of\r\n  months of sickness, misery, and ill health, ending with hours of\r\n  agony that are not veiled under the cloak of chloroform’s most\r\n  merciful sleep. These are the people that we want to help.\r\n\r\nWe, too, were dedicated to help such women, and each day brought more to\r\nthe doors of our clinic than we could provide instruction for, from all\r\nover the country and of all classes. Some weeks so many Italian women\r\ncrowded in that we had to employ an interpreter. Then droves of Spanish\r\nor of Jewish arrived.\r\n\r\nMerely judging by the letters that had come to me I was prepared to find\r\nmany psychological problems presented. I often thought of the high cost\r\nof small families for women who had more or less restricted their\r\nprocreative powers through other means than contraception. Although the\r\nsize was limited, it was frequently accompanied by marital unhappiness\r\nand hidden psychic disturbances. But the kindness of Dr. Stone aided\r\nimmeasurably in our informal “court of domestic relations.”\r\n\r\nOne hot July day when I was coming out of the clinic I saw a woman,\r\nobviously pregnant, carrying a year-and-a-half-old baby, dragging\r\nanother one, only a trifle bigger, crying behind her. The little girl’s\r\nshoes were too short and were pinching her toes. I squirmed myself,\r\nremembering my own squeezed feet as a child. I caught up with her.\r\n“Can’t I carry one of the babies? This one seems tired. Which way are\r\nyou going?”\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where the jail is?”\r\n\r\n“The nearest one is on Spring Street, I think.”\r\n\r\n“No, there’s a jail somewheres around here.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you get the address?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I left it on the table.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want a jail for?”\r\n\r\n“My man’s there.”\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“Leaving me. He always does when I get like this.”\r\n\r\n“How many children have you?”\r\n\r\n“Nine.”\r\n\r\n“How often has he left you?”\r\n\r\n“This is the fourth time now.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want any more children?”\r\n\r\n“No!” emphatically.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever know there was a way to stop having so many?”\r\n\r\nShe almost dropped the infant, took hold of me, and said, “They won’t\r\ngive it to me. I’m asking everybody. They’ll only give it to the rich.\r\nHe wants it. He’ll even have an operation. But nobody’ll tell us.”\r\n\r\nI wrote down our street and number and said, “You go back to that place\r\nwhere I met you, and the doctor there will tell you about it.”\r\n\r\nThe next day I was called up unofficially by a social worker, one of\r\nthose who used to send us cases on their own initiative. She wished to\r\nexplain to me: the husband would be let off if he promised to live with\r\nhis family and support them; otherwise he had to serve a sentence. His\r\nwife had seen him and shown him my note; he had said he would rather go\r\nto the Island for three years than come out, unless we could not only\r\nguarantee his getting the information, but, furthermore, that it would\r\nwork. He was fed up with having a new baby every year.\r\n\r\nWe suggested he talk it over with us and bring his wife. She was silent,\r\nglum, did not appear to know what it was all about. He was discouraged\r\nand doubtful. We gave him the information and he departed. “I’m the one\r\nto do this. She won’t,” glaring at his wife, who tagged on behind him.\r\n\r\nWe hoped for the best.\r\n\r\nAbout half a year later both returned for the check-up, she with her\r\nhand on his arm. This vague, dumb, immobile woman was now in spruce\r\njacket and skirt, head up, stepping lightly. You would never have known\r\nher for the same person. The two were off to the movies together.\r\n\r\nFew social workers were understanding enough to smooth the lives of\r\npeople in such difficulties. One agency was told by a doctor that a\r\ncertain family on its rolls must not increase; the mother had already\r\nborne four babies and had a bad heart. A visiting nurse relayed this to\r\nthe husband one Sunday morning when he was home from work. “If your wife\r\nbecomes pregnant again, you’ll be a murderer.”\r\n\r\nHe was frightened. “I don’t want to kill her. What shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“Sleep alone.”\r\n\r\nThe husband’s disposition began to change; he became gloomy, would not\r\ntalk to his wife, was ugly in sudden tempers, slapped, shouted at, and\r\neven kicked the children, rushed into the house to eat his meals and\r\nthen out again, not retreating to his own bed until after she was in\r\nhers, which had been made up in the kitchen where it was warm. She was\r\nso unhappy over the metamorphosis that she made tentative approaches,\r\nwhereupon he beat her and ran into the street. The next day she marched\r\nto the nurses’ settlement to tell them what she thought of them. “If all\r\nyou can do is keep my husband from me, stay away. I’d rather be dead\r\nthan live like this!”\r\n\r\nThe case was taken to a physician, who sensibly warned, “You can’t\r\nseparate people by such barriers. That’s not the answer.”\r\n\r\nThen she was sent to us. After she had been instructed the tension\r\nlessened and the domestic situation was remedied.\r\n\r\nIn another family of six children, the husband, part Italian and part\r\nsome other nationality, was affectionate and irresponsible. Every time\r\nhe walked in the door, wreathed in smiles, his wife greeted him with\r\nfrowns and scowls. She threw dishes and pots at him. He thought she was\r\ncrazy and asked to have her committed. A psychiatrist talked to her and\r\nfound she was in deadly fear of being pregnant again. When we saw her\r\nshe really appeared to be demented.\r\n\r\nOne forenoon, six months later, as I passed through the waiting room,\r\nthe nurse at the desk tendered her usual, “Good morning, Mrs. Sanger.”\r\nImmediately a neat, trim woman came over to me.\r\n\r\n“Look at me,” she beamed. “You don’t know me. I was the one who sat\r\nthere and they said I was crazy. I don’t look crazy now, do I? I wasn’t\r\ncrazy then—just worried to death.”\r\n\r\nFor four years we went along in the clinic, working steadily,\r\nstraightening mental tangles and relieving physical distress when we\r\ncould. Then, early in the morning of April 15, 1929, the telephone in my\r\napartment rang, startling me. I was pretty nervous, having been up all\r\nnight with Stuart, who had mastoiditis. His temperature was running\r\nhigh, and he was suffering with terrible, indescribable pain.\r\n\r\nI took off the receiver. “Hello. This is Anna. The police are here at\r\nthe clinic.” Briefly she related how they had descended without warning,\r\nstamped into the basement, and were at that moment tearing things to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nWith this meager information pounding through my brain I hastened to the\r\nstreet, hailed a taxi, and urged the driver to go as fast as he could to\r\nWest Fifteenth Street.\r\n\r\nThe shade to the glass door was pulled down; the door itself was locked.\r\nI knocked and a plain-clothes man of the Vice Squad opened it. “Well,\r\nwho are you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m Mrs. Sanger and I want to come in.”\r\n\r\nMy request was passed on to a superior and I heard someone answer, “Let\r\nher in.”\r\n\r\nInside, in a room more than ordinarily small because partitions had\r\nsliced it up to make minute consultation booths, the patients were\r\nsitting quietly, some of them weeping. Detectives were hurrying\r\naimlessly here and there like chickens fluttering about a raided roost,\r\ncalling to each other and, amid the confusion, demanding names and\r\naddresses. The three nurses were standing around; Dr. Elizabeth Pissoort\r\nwas practically in hysterics.\r\n\r\nDr. Stone was aloof, utterly unmoved by the tumult and the noise. I have\r\nalways admired her attitude. This was the first time in her life she had\r\nbeen arrested, yet she treated it so lightly. “Isn’t this fantastic?”\r\nshe remarked. “Only a few moments ago a visiting physician from the\r\nMiddle West asked one of the nurses whether we ever had any police\r\ninterference. ‘Oh, no,’ the nurse cheerfully replied. ‘Those days are\r\nover.’”\r\n\r\nStocky Mrs. Mary Sullivan, head of the City Policewomen’s Bureau, was\r\nsuperintending the raid in person. Her round, thick-set face might have\r\nbeen genial when smiling, but was very terrifying when flushed with\r\nanger. She was giving orders to her minions in such rapid succession\r\nthat it seemed impossible to keep pace with them. I tried to talk to\r\nher, asking why she had come and what it was all about.\r\n\r\n“You’ll see,” said Mrs. Sullivan, and went on directing the patrolmen\r\nwho were removing books from shelves, pictures and diagrams from walls,\r\nand sweeping out the contents of medical cabinets. In their zeal I\r\nnoticed they were seizing articles from the sterilizers, such as gloves\r\nand medicine droppers, having no sinister significance whatsoever. They\r\nwere also gathering up the various strange, weird devices patients had\r\nbrought us to inquire as to their efficacy, and which we exhibited as\r\ncurios.\r\n\r\nPatrolwoman Anna McNamara, far less assured than her chief, was\r\nconsulting a list in her hand and turning over the case histories in the\r\nfiles as swiftly as her fingers could move. Many of these contained the\r\npersonal confessions of women, some of whom had entrusted us with the\r\nknowledge that their husbands had venereal disease or insanity. It ran\r\nthrough my mind that dire misfortune could follow in the way of being\r\nblackmailed by anyone obtaining the records.\r\n\r\nI requested Mrs. Sullivan to show me her search warrant, and saw it had\r\nbeen signed by Chief Magistrate McAdoo. Nevertheless, I cautioned her,\r\n“You have no right to touch those files. Not even the nurses ever see\r\nthem. They are the private property of the doctors, and if you take them\r\nyou will get into trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Trouble,” she snapped back. “I get into trouble? What about the trouble\r\nyou’re in?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t change mine for yours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is _my_ party. You keep out.”\r\n\r\nOne of the policemen scooped up all the name cards and stuffed them into\r\na waste basket to be carried off as “evidence.” This was a prime\r\nviolation of medical ethics; nothing was more sacred to a doctor than\r\nthe confidences of his patients. Immediately Anna telephoned Dr. Robert\r\nL. Dickinson at the Academy of Medicine that the police were\r\nconfiscating the case histories of patients and asked him to recommend a\r\nlawyer. He suggested Morris L. Ernst, whom Anna then called.\r\n\r\nDoctors, nurses, and evidence were being hustled into the street. The\r\npatrol wagon had arrived, but I summoned taxicabs in which we rode to\r\nthe West Twentieth Street station. On the way I heard part of the story,\r\nwhich accounted for my non-arrest. About three weeks earlier a woman who\r\nhad registered under the name of Mrs. Tierney had come for contraceptive\r\nadvice and, on examination, was found by both doctors to have rectocele,\r\ncystocele, prolapsus of the uterus, erosions, and retroversion. Although\r\nnot informed of her exact condition, she was instructed, because another\r\npregnancy would be dangerous, and told to return for a check-up. She had\r\nnow done so under her rightful name of McNamara, including in her\r\nentourage Mrs. Sullivan and a police squad.\r\n\r\nDr. Stone, Dr. Pissoort, and the three nurses were booked for violation\r\nof Section 1142, though I attempted to explain the clinic had been\r\nactive for six years quite legally under the exception, Section 1145. At\r\nJefferson Market Court, to which we next traveled, Magistrate Rosenbluth\r\nlooked over the warrant and ordered a three-hundred-dollar bond for\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding morning I sent Stuart to a hospital for treatment; I had\r\nto attend a meeting in Boston, and the day after that go to Chicago for\r\na series of lectures. Again I was obliged to leave him, and this time\r\nwith even more misgivings. At Buffalo came a telegram saying a mastoid\r\noperation had been performed. At Chicago I telephoned the doctor and was\r\nreassured. The moment my duties were over I hurried back to be with him,\r\nand, incidentally, to attend the hearings.\r\n\r\nI still had no idea of the fate of the case histories and had been very\r\nworried. Now I learned that the evening after the raid Magistrate McAdoo\r\nhad been dining with Dr. Karl Reiland, my husband’s pastor. Dr. Reiland,\r\nmuch upset, had remarked upon its outrageousness. Justice McAdoo, aghast\r\nand horrified to find that, without reading it, he had signed this\r\nwarrant, just one of many laid on his desk, had called up the police\r\nstation without delay, saying that all the twenty-four histories must be\r\nput in his safe and kept there until he arrived in the morning. He had\r\nperceived instantly that those doctors’ records were going to be a\r\nserious embarrassment.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty cards, our sole memoranda of names and addresses,\r\nwere never restored. Catholic patients, whose records had thus been\r\npurloined, received mysterious and anonymous telephone calls warning\r\nthem if they continued to go to the clinic their private lives would be\r\nexposed. They came to us asking fearfully, “Will I get in the papers?”\r\n\r\nImmediately after the raid various doctors volunteered to go on the\r\nstand and testify as to the medical principles involved. The New York\r\nCounty Medical Society was aroused and passed a resolution protesting\r\nagainst the seizure. Through Dr. Dickinson’s foresightedness and\r\nenergetic interest the Academy of Medicine held a special meeting which\r\nresolved:\r\n\r\n  We view with grave concern any action on the part of the authorities\r\n  which contravenes the inviolability of the confidential relations\r\n  which always have and should obtain between physicians and their\r\n  patients.\r\n\r\nPolice Commissioner Grover A. Whalen, then embroiled in a mortifying,\r\nfutile investigation of the murder of Arnold Rothstein, the gambler, had\r\ntermed the raid a “routine matter,” but when Dr. Linsley Williams,\r\nDirector of the Academy, wrote a letter of protest, he decided it might\r\nnot have been so routine as it had appeared, and apologized.\r\n\r\nWhat had caused the raid in the first place? I employed the Burns\r\nDetective Agency to sift the affair. Approximately fifty percent of our\r\ncases were being sent by social workers on the lower East and West\r\nSides, a conglomerate of all peoples and classes, including Irish,\r\nItalians, and other Catholics. So many had benefited and told their\r\nneighbors that others also were asking of their agencies how to get to\r\nour clinic. Catholic social workers, at a monthly meeting with officials\r\nof the Church, had sought guidance in replying to parishioners, and the\r\necclesiastics had been shocked to find that a clinic existed. Catholic\r\npolicewomen had been summoned, Mary Sullivan had been chosen to wipe out\r\nthe Clinical Research Bureau, and Mrs. McNamara selected for the decoy.\r\n\r\nMorris Ernst, who had accepted our case, had already won a reputation\r\nfor his espousal of liberal causes. It was most encouraging to discover\r\na lawyer who was as convinced as we that the principle of the law was\r\nthe important issue. Although he seemed very young, the moment I talked\r\nwith him I recognized here was the person for us. He was a good\r\npsychologist as well as a good lawyer. He tried to bring everything out,\r\nbut wanted the evidence correct and the minds of the witnesses straight\r\nas to what had happened.\r\n\r\nOn April 21st, when Magistrate Rosenbluth called the case, the attitude\r\nin the courtroom was far different from anything exhibited at previous\r\nbirth control hearings. Only one witness was heard that day, Mrs.\r\nMcNamara. In spite of the hostility of Assistant District Attorney\r\nHogan, which was to be expected, and in spite of the Magistrate’s\r\nprompting that she was a policewoman and not required to tell all, Mrs.\r\nMcNamara was made to confess she had set out deliberately to deceive the\r\nclinic doctors. As she testified under Mr. Ernst’s cross-examination\r\nwhat she had done, her stolid face turned from pink to purple. On her\r\nfirst visit she had learned the routine and on her second, being left\r\nalone, had copied down the number of every name card lying on Dr.\r\nStone’s desk.\r\n\r\nMurmurs rose among the spectators, a melodious sound to ears still\r\nechoing with the harsh and suspicious accents of a mere twelve years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAfter forty minutes Magistrate Rosenbluth adjourned the hearing over our\r\nprotests; if the object had been to secure a quieter and less\r\nsympathetic audience the ensuing day it failed. Now physicians took the\r\nstand: Dr. Dickinson, Dr. Frederick C. Holden, Dr. Foster Kennedy, the\r\nneurologist. The climax came when Mr. Hogan asked Dr. Louis T. Harris,\r\nformer Commissioner of Health of New York City, whether he had ever\r\ngiven any information to a patient regardless of a marriage certificate.\r\nDr. Harris answered, “The birth control clinic is a public health work.\r\nEvery woman desiring treatment is asked whether she is married.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t they have to bring their marriage certificates with them?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThe Magistrate leaned forward ponderously and heavily. “Does not the\r\nclinic send out social workers to discover the truth of patients’\r\nstatements?”\r\n\r\nMr. Ernst interpolated, “Did you ever know of a situation where a doctor\r\ndispatched a detective to find out whether his patient were married?”\r\n\r\nLoud laughter came from the listeners. Judge Rosenbluth pounded his\r\ngavel. “Unless there is absolute silence I shall clear the court room.”\r\nThen, seeming to grow more angry, he added, “On second thought I shall\r\nclear it anyhow. Out you go.”\r\n\r\nThe joke was on him. It was the doctors who had laughed the loudest and\r\ntheir presence as witnesses could not be dispensed with. Following a\r\nfifteen-minute recess the audience was once again in the room, more\r\npartisan than ever.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Hogan tried to be dramatic, but he failed before our\r\nattorney’s cold uncompromising logic. He took up one of the pessaries\r\nthat had been appropriated in the raid and addressed Dr. Harris. “You\r\nknow that the laws of New York State are that contraception may be given\r\nonly for the cure or prevention of disease. Do you dare to claim this\r\narticle will cure tuberculosis? Will it cure cancer, high blood\r\npressure, heart disease, kidney disease?”\r\n\r\nAgain came mirth. No one assumed a pessary or any other form of\r\ncontraceptive could effect a cure. “But,” replied Dr. Harris, “in\r\npreventing conception it may be said to cure because pregnancy can often\r\nbe the cause of furthering the progress of a disease.”\r\n\r\nA month later the defendants were discharged, Magistrate Rosenbluth\r\nwriting an admirably lucid, fair, and definite decision:\r\n\r\n  Good faith in these circumstances is the belief of the physician\r\n  that the prevention of conception is necessary for a patient’s\r\n  health and physical welfare.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sullivan was temporarily demoted. She continued, however, to be\r\npaid the same salary as before, and was eventually restored to rank.\r\n\r\nIt was an ill wind that did not blow somebody good. After this our\r\ncalendars were filled three weeks in advance, and we had to add two\r\nevenings a week to the daily routine. To our amazement among the many\r\npatients there appeared one afternoon Mrs. McNamara, who had first heard\r\nin court of her five ailments, every one of which legally entitled her\r\nto contraceptive information. She had come back to ask Dr. Stone whether\r\nshe really had so many things the matter with her, and was assured the\r\ndiagnosis was correct.\r\n\r\nThe raid had been one of the worst errors committed by the opposition,\r\nbecause it had touched the doctors in a most sensitive spot, the\r\nsanctity of records, and they were obliged to stand by us, whether they\r\nwanted to or not. Even so we were not yet certain that the question had\r\nbeen settled for all time. At any moment our Irish landlord might\r\nreceive orders from his bishop to eject us. To avoid any such\r\ncontingency and to take care of the increasing numbers, in 1930 we\r\nbought a house of our own at Seventeen West Sixteenth Street.\r\n\r\nOur new building gave us not only more room for patients but better\r\nopportunities for research. It was a sad commentary that though medicine\r\nhad evolved into the preventive state where it was causing a revolution\r\nin sanitation and health education, contraceptive technique had been\r\nlittle advanced since the days of Mensinga.\r\n\r\nHowever, research was going on in various lands under the most diverse\r\nconditions. A modern clinic had started up again in the Netherlands, a\r\nmemorial to Aletta Jacobs and bearing her name. It was based on the old\r\nRutgers standards which had lapsed for so long. America and England, as\r\nthe consequence of guiding the movement along professional lines and\r\nputting emphasis on the keeping of records, had made the greatest\r\nstrides. But all accomplishments needed to be correlated, co-ordinated,\r\nunified in a scientific conference. Zurich was a central location for\r\nmany countries, and, in addition, offered beautiful scenery in\r\nabundance; it was a pleasant place to be.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1, 1930, some one hundred and thirty physicians and directors\r\nof clinics from different parts of the world began comparing notes and\r\nreporting progress. Only the present generation was behind the times. A\r\nrepresentative from the Netherlands one day stood up, a rather youthful\r\nperson, and said, “I am glad to announce that at last we in the\r\nNetherlands have also a birth control clinic.” This was extraordinary in\r\nview of the fact that the Netherlands had been the pioneer country and\r\nhad inspired us all.\r\n\r\nEven more recently I encountered a young matron, a member of the\r\nAmerican Birth Control League and head of the state organization in New\r\nJersey, who had again utterly disassociated herself from history. She\r\nurged, “Mrs. Sanger, can’t we convert you to the establishment of\r\nclinics? You know, they’re going, they’re being established all over the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“When were you born?” was all I could gasp.\r\n\r\nThese two women epitomized a day which had not studied what had gone\r\nbefore; if new to their minds, then it was new.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Geneva and its problems in tact, Zurich was a dovecote.\r\nOne slight incident alone disturbed the calm. I had gone to Berlin to\r\nsecure delegates and there in a public theater had seen a film which had\r\ntraversed the length and breadth of Germany as propaganda for abortion\r\nunder safe conditions. The scene opened with feet endlessly passing on\r\nthe streets; you saw a kerchief drop, a masculine hand reach down to\r\npick it up, the boy and girl at lunch, she looking up at him wide-eyed.\r\nSoon she was obliged to go to a _femme savante_ in a filthy narrow old\r\nalley; you watched her ascend the rickety stairs, an ancient crone\r\npeeling potatoes, shoving wood in the stove with dirty hands, the agony\r\nin the girl’s face. It was a succession of pictures such as this,\r\nstraight out of life itself.\r\n\r\nI had borrowed the film and rented a theater in Geneva. To my great\r\nsurprise and no little amusement when the Caesarian section appeared on\r\nthe screen several men and women in the audience began to faint, among\r\nthem our own workers, even Edith How-Martyn. One, a young scientist, had\r\nto be led out and given a drink to brace him up. Cars and taxis were\r\ncommandeered to cart the squeamish back to their hotels.\r\n\r\nThis Conference must remain a milestone because there all propaganda,\r\nall moral and ethical aspects of the subject were forgotten. The whole\r\nproblem was lifted out of the troubled atmosphere of theory, where\r\npreviously it had been battered by the winds of doctrine and the brutal\r\ngusts of prejudice, into the current of serene, impersonal, scientific\r\nabstraction. It was too early to tell what practical results might\r\nensue, but at least we soon received the assurance that certain doctors\r\nwould welcome efficient contraceptives.\r\n\r\nIndividual physicians in New York had since 1923 taken serious thought\r\nof the need for contraception. Mrs. Amos Pinchot had organized certain\r\noutstanding members of the Academy of Medicine into the Committee on\r\nMaternal Health. They had been fortunate enough to secure the well-known\r\nretired gynecologist, Dr. Dickinson, as secretary. He had trained many\r\nof the younger men and was able to bring into the movement doctors who\r\nwould have paid slight attention to anyone less admired and honored.\r\nWith the aid of various foundations, the Committee on Maternal Health\r\nhad been doing a fine piece of work in publishing the findings of\r\nscientists in brochures and pamphlets.\r\n\r\nThe Academy, after the Zurich Conference, formally declared that “the\r\npublic is entitled to expect counsel and information by the medical\r\nprofession on the important and intimate matter of contraceptive\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nWe had been attaining small victories, and little by little and bit by\r\nbit the Protestant churches had begun to regard us favorably. In\r\nSeptember, 1925, the House of Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nChurch, meeting at Portland, Oregon, had gone on record against birth\r\ncontrol. Later some of the wives of these same bishops had come to me in\r\nNew York and asked my help in educating their husbands. A group of three\r\nhad taken it upon themselves to see that every bishop was thoroughly\r\nenlightened. The consequence of the campaign was that at a subsequent\r\nmeeting in 1934 they reversed their original stand.\r\n\r\nEven the Jews had on occasion been in opposition. Rabbi Mischkind of\r\nTremont Temple had been rebuked by his Board of Trustees for having\r\ninvited me to speak one Sunday morning. Rather than surrender he had\r\nresigned and found another synagogue in which I could appear.\r\n\r\nNow the Central Conference of American Rabbis urged the recognition of\r\nbirth control. The hundred and seventieth conference of the Methodist\r\nChurch sanctioned it and the American Unitarian Association did the\r\nsame. A special commission appointed by the Presbyterian General\r\nAssembly to study the problems of divorce and remarriage admitted the\r\ndesirability of restricting births under medical advice. And in March,\r\n1931, the Committee on Marriage and the Home of the Federal Council of\r\nthe Churches of Christ in America approved it.\r\n\r\nDue in large measure to Lord Dawson’s eloquence, the Bishops at Lambeth\r\ngave us one of our greatest triumphs by voting 193 to 67 in favor of\r\nbirth control. Bernard Shaw believed the Church of England was making a\r\n“belated attempt to see whether it could catch up with the Twentieth\r\nCentury.”\r\n\r\nEver since the outburst of religious intolerance at Town Hall, it had\r\nbeen apparent that in the United States the Catholic hierarchy and\r\nofficialdom were going to be the principal enemies of birth control.\r\nFrom city to city you could feel this. At Albany we could not have a\r\nhall because the police commissioner was a Catholic. In Cincinnati the\r\nKnights of Columbus almost succeeded in barring us from the hotel. At\r\nSyracuse the mayor had to veto the ordinance of the Catholic Council\r\nbefore we could hold a conference there. When I was to give a lecture in\r\nMilwaukee the Catholic Women’s League came to protest the meeting to\r\nSocialist Mayor Hoane. He had told them, however, “If I prevent Mrs.\r\nSanger from speaking because you protest, I shall also have to prevent\r\nyou from speaking when others object to Catholic doctrine. Free speech\r\nmust prevail in Milwaukee.”\r\n\r\nTactics aiming to bring about a reconciliation between the Anglicans and\r\nRome had been rendered futile by the endorsement of the Bishops. I\r\nsuspected the demand for a clear statement from the Vatican on the\r\nquestion originated in the United States where Catholic women were\r\nshowing a gradual yet persistent spirit of independence. In spite of\r\nChurch canons they were using contraceptives, and the Church, in its\r\nwisdom, was obliged to change the law to keep its parishioners from\r\nbreaking it. In December came the answer in the form of a Papal\r\nEncyclical. The world moved but the Pope sat still. He declared that he\r\nwas “looking with paternal eye—as from a watch-tower.” But what was he\r\nlooking at?\r\n\r\nThe Pope said over and over again that sexual intercourse, unless\r\ndefinitely designed to produce children, was against nature and a sin;\r\nhe roundly condemned any contraceptive and he affirmed that in the\r\nmatter of limiting families continence alone was permissible. Yet in the\r\nselfsame document he nullified his previous insistence that procreation\r\nwas the sole justification of marital relations by countenancing them at\r\ntimes when pregnancy could not result. These times he made indefinite;\r\nthey might refer to sterility, post-menopause, or the so-called “safe\r\nperiod” during the menstrual cycle; in fine, he was saying first, that\r\nyou might not have intercourse unless you expected to have a child, and,\r\nin the same breath, that you might have intercourse when you could not\r\npossibly have a child. This Jesuitical inconsistency allowed a loophole\r\nfor the issuance of the Latz Foundation booklet entitled _The Rhythm of\r\nSterility and Fertility in Women_, published with “ecclesiastical\r\napproval” and recommended by Catholic societies.\r\n\r\nIt had become part of my routine to answer every challenge to the cause,\r\njust as I tried to answer every question at a meeting. Here again was\r\nthe hoary “nature” argument which should have been in its grave long\r\nsince. The contention that it was sin to interrupt nature in her\r\nprocesses was simple nonsense. The Pope frustrated her by shaving or\r\nhaving his hair cut. Whenever we caught a fish or shot a wolf or\r\nslaughtered a lamb, whenever we pulled a weed or pruned a fruit tree, we\r\ntoo frustrated nature. Disease germs were perfectly natural little\r\nfellows which had to be frustrated before we could get well. As for the\r\nalleged “safe period” which _Rhythm_ now set forth, what could be more\r\nunnatural than to restrict intercourse to the very time when nature had\r\nleast intended it?\r\n\r\nBut, taking one consideration with another, it seemed to me then that\r\nthe birth control idea was rolling merrily along. I could sympathize\r\nwith an indignant old radical who left a birth control congress\r\nsniffing, “This thing has got too darned safe for me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-four_\r\n\r\n                      SENATORS, BE NOT AFFRIGHTED\r\n\r\n\r\n“Should the Federal Laws Be Changed?” was the subject of my debate with\r\nChief Justice Richard B. Russell of Georgia, who had had eighteen\r\nchildren by two wives. I always welcomed a debate, although after the\r\nfirst few years it had been almost impossible to find anyone to defend\r\nthe other side, and therefore I was pleased to be called to Atlanta, in\r\nMay, 1931, for this one.\r\n\r\nThe old judge, white-haired and with white eyebrows and mustache, his\r\nfigure still erect, fixed me with a glance, sometimes satiric and\r\nsometimes flaming with the rage of an Old Testament prophet. He talked\r\nof the sacredness of motherhood, the home, and the State of Georgia. “We\r\ndon’t need birth control in Georgia. We’ve had to give up two\r\nCongressmen now because we don’t have enough people. If New York wants\r\nto wipe out her population, she can. We need ours.... I can take care of\r\nall the children God sent me. I believe God sent them to me because they\r\nhave souls. Poodle dogs and jackasses don’t have souls. I have obeyed\r\nthe command of God to ‘increase and multiply.’”\r\n\r\nHis children and their wives and their relatives occupying several rows\r\nof seats down front applauded vigorously.\r\n\r\nOn the train coming back I bought a paper and noted with surprise that I\r\nhad been awarded the American Women’s Association medal for\r\naccomplishments on behalf of women, and was supposed to be receiving it\r\nthat night in New York. I sent a telegram of thanks to Anne Morgan\r\nsaying that I had just learned about it and there was no way of my\r\nattending.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to be handed a medal instead of a warrant; at the postponed\r\ndinner, organized by John A. Kingsbury, a director of the Milbank Fund,\r\nI sat there listening to the beautiful tributes and asked myself, “Is it\r\nreally true? Am I awake? Or is it a dream?” I never thought of the medal\r\nas being given to me as a person, but to the cause, the women I\r\nrepresented, and, representing them, went through the act of accepting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs I was trying to express this, a little woman who used to appear\r\nfrequently on all sorts of occasions came up through the well-groomed\r\naudience, climbed to the platform, offered me a bouquet of flowers from\r\nthe Brownsville mothers. “You are our Abraham Lincoln,” she said,\r\nunconscious of the smiles, amused yet sympathetic, of the audience. She\r\nleft a kiss upon my brow and hurriedly went back to her place. To me she\r\nembodied the spirit of Mrs. Sachs, who had died so long ago—all I was\r\nstill working for, though through channels which had broadened\r\nimmeasurably since then.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the birth control movement the main purpose had been\r\nthe mitigation of women’s suffering, Comstock law or no Comstock law.\r\nIts very genesis had been the conscious, deliberate, and public\r\nviolation of this statute. Later, to change it became imperative, so\r\nthat the millions who depended upon dispensaries and hospitals could be\r\ninstructed by capable hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 Mary Ware Dennett had dissolved the old National Birth Control\r\nLeague into the Voluntary Parenthood League, which had for its aim the\r\nrepeal of the Federal law. This seemed fine on the surface but repeal\r\nwould permit anyone to give and send contraceptive devices as well as\r\ninformation to anyone through the mails regardless of standards or\r\nquality. Mrs. Dennett still looked upon the movement as a free-speech\r\nand free-press issue, just as I had done before going to the\r\nNetherlands. Now I considered no one had sufficient knowledge of the\r\npossible consequences of some contraceptives to permit them to be\r\nmanufactured or distributed without guidance or direction. They might\r\nkill the birth control movement as well as some of the women who used\r\nthem. No sponsor could be found until in 1923 Senator Cummins had\r\nintroduced her repeal, or so-called open bill, in which the lack of\r\nsafeguards was severely criticized. Therefore she had had it\r\nreintroduced in 1924 with a clause added that all literature containing\r\ncontraceptive information must be certified by five physicians as “not\r\ninjurious to life or health.” This bill, practically impossible of\r\napplication, died in committee.\r\n\r\nSince we believed information should be disseminated only by doctors we\r\nhad kept very quiet and out of it during those years. But we had our own\r\nideas of what sort of legislation we preferred. When Mrs. Dennett\r\nretired and her organization ceased its work Mrs. Day, Anne Kennedy, and\r\nI, in January, 1926, went down to Washington on a scouting expedition to\r\ntake a survey of the mental attitude of Congressmen and discover whether\r\ntheir reaction was more favorable towards a repeal bill or our proposal\r\nof an “amended doctors’ bill.” We set up headquarters and began\r\ninterviewing senators until we had satisfied ourselves that personal\r\nsentiment was more in favor of our policy.\r\n\r\nWe thought it advisable also to sound out the Catholic stand. Getting\r\ntogether was the trend of the times. Eugenists, the Voluntary Parenthood\r\nLeague, the American Birth Control League, all were trying to meet each\r\nother. People of tolerant opinions had always felt the Catholic Church\r\nwas too clever to oppose a movement that inevitably it would some day\r\nhave to sanction, and the tumult and interference was simply the result\r\nof local ignorance and bigotry; if we could reach the scholarly heads\r\nthemselves, if we could all “sit at a table and talk things over,” we\r\nwould find their ideals of humanitarianism were much like our own.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Anne had an interview with members of the Catholic Welfare\r\nConference, including Monsignor John Ryan, John M. Cooper, Ph.D., Father\r\nBurke, and other prelates. We thought we would agree on the doctors’\r\nbill—that they surely wanted the public safeguarded from the misuse of\r\ncontraceptives. But they unequivocally set forth their objections; not\r\neven a physician’s indisputable right to save lives swayed them. They\r\ndeclared it was their office to see that no “social or moral”\r\nlegislation passed Congress that did not conform to the tenets of\r\nCatholic doctrine; they would attempt to prevent any such bill from\r\nbecoming a law. Anne wrote out a report of the interview, including this\r\nshocking statement, and showed it to them so they might have an\r\nopportunity to correct it if they so desired. They left it essentially\r\nas written.\r\n\r\nConsidering this a fundamental issue of liberty and life not affecting\r\nbirth control alone, I took the presumptuous document to H. L. Mencken,\r\nsupposedly the outstanding libertarian in America. He had the power to\r\nevoke a response from thinking minds, even though they were rock-bound\r\nin patriotic dogmas; he had knocked down a great many gods, chiefly\r\nalong political and religious lines.\r\n\r\nTrusting that Mencken would make an effective protest in the _American\r\nMercury_, I talked to him, explained the situation, predicting that if\r\nwe let this go unnoticed we should all have to endure the future\r\nconsequences. He admitted the Catholic action was brazen, but mentioned\r\nthe fact that he had too many friends of that faith in Baltimore for him\r\nto attack their church. I gained the impression he was out to slash and\r\nhit where the cause was obviously popular, but had no intention of\r\nleading a forlorn hope or playing the role of a pioneer for freedom. He\r\nnever fulfilled the expectations I once had of him; he was not a tree\r\nbearing fruit but a spoon stirring around, very much of a “Yes, but-er.”\r\nHe said, “Oh, yes, that is grand, but, on the other hand, there is this\r\nto be said for the other side.”\r\n\r\nIn our campaign of educating the public in the necessity for changing\r\nthe Federal statute I began having regional conferences in the East,\r\nSouth, Middle West, West, and linking them all into an organization to\r\nsupport the bill. One of these was at Los Angeles. At first most of the\r\nWesterners wanted an open bill such as Mrs. Dennett’s, and I stood\r\nrather alone on the doctors’ amendment, which was only approved on the\r\nlast night of the Conference by a very narrow margin.\r\n\r\nAs the people filed out I saw at the end of the room a thin, almost\r\nemaciated woman with gray hair, somewhat shabby, but not unusually so.\r\nShe held out a bony hand to clasp mine, saying practically nothing, just\r\na word or two, and her name, Kaufman, came to me. I remembered it\r\nbecause Viola Kaufman had been one of the small subscribers to birth\r\ncontrol in the past, and I was familiar with most of these names. I\r\nthought nothing further of it at the time.\r\n\r\nWanting all the endorsement I could get for the doctors’ bill, and\r\nparticularly that of the American Medical Association, I made a special\r\ntrip to Chicago to see Dr. Morris Fishbein, who was a power in that\r\norganization. I asked for advice or help, and offered to draw up a bill\r\nin any way which would suit them. Dr. Fishbein appeared sympathetic and\r\nturned me over to Dr. William C. Woodward, the legislative director; we\r\nhad a pleasant conversation and that was all. Though he made no comment\r\nas to its merits or demerits, I put the bill on record in their office.\r\n\r\nTried and true friends, whose abilities and loyalties had been tested\r\nand proved, rallied around the National Committee on Federal Legislation\r\nfor Birth Control, which established its headquarters in Washington in\r\n1931. Frances Ackermann assisted my husband as Treasurer. For Vice\r\nPresident we had Mrs. Walter Timme who had left the League of Women\r\nVoters, a fine speaker, a clear-thinking crusader, a devoted ally of\r\nlong standing. Tall, large-framed, broad-shouldered, she could harangue\r\naudiences in the strong, convincing, and forceful fashion of the early,\r\nsuffrage, soapbox days—nothing delicate or fragile. When she had an\r\nidea, it was an idea, and she stated it as an idea. More than once our\r\nbank account would have faded to a mere wraith had it not been for Ida\r\nTimme’s money-raising talents.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander C. Dick was Secretary. She had the old-fashioned head of\r\na daguerreotype, but was thoroughly modern in her verve and gay\r\npersonality and her quick agility of mind. Since 1916, when I had first\r\nknown her, she had been really interested in the research end of birth\r\ncontrol, and definitely had agreed with the then new war cry that it\r\nshould be under medical supervision. It was mainly due to her and her\r\nlate husband, Charles Brush of Cleveland, that Ohio had had from the\r\nbeginning one of the best organized and conducted state leagues.\r\n\r\nKate Hepburn was Chairman. In her long public career she had learned\r\ngreat efficiency and was so careful of minutiae that she never let our\r\nwitnesses run over their time. Just as we were swinging along briskly\r\nshe invariably tugged at a coat and passed over a little slip—“time up\r\nin one minute.”\r\n\r\nBest of all our lobbyists was Mrs. Hazel Moore, our Legislative\r\nSecretary, who had left the Red Cross in the South to support us.\r\nNothing could withstand her indefatigable enthusiasm, and it took a\r\nstout Senator to harden his heart against her feminine ruses and winning\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nWe now began to be initiated into the A B C of Federal legislative\r\nprocedure. After your bill had been drawn up, you had to find a\r\nCongressman to introduce it. Sometimes he believed in it a hundred\r\npercent; sometimes he believed in the individual a hundred percent;\r\nsometimes he sponsored it only to be accommodating and agreeable, in\r\nwhich case it was called “by request,” a very weak way since you knew he\r\nwas not going to fight for it. When introduced, the bill was read in the\r\nHouse or Senate and at once referred to a committee, those having to do\r\nwith changing a law to the Judiciary. Ours was difficult to manage at\r\nfirst, because we were trying to alter several statutes simultaneously,\r\nnot merely Section 211 and everything pertaining to mails and common\r\ncarriers, but also laws relating to imports. We had a general principle\r\nback of us, but we had to keep whacking off clauses so that it would not\r\nbe thrown into the wrong committee.\r\n\r\nIf you were fortunate enough to secure a Senate hearing for your bill\r\nthe chairman of your committee appointed a sub-committee of about three;\r\nin the House, the entire committee might attend the hearing. A day was\r\nset and you began preparing your ammunition; the opposition was allowed\r\nan equal amount of time to the second. After the hearing a vote was\r\ntaken. If they were against it, they killed it then and there; if they\r\nrecommended it, it came up before the full committee and, if then\r\napproved, went to the Senate or House for debate on the floor.\r\n\r\nTo the frantic, worried, harassed, driven Congressmen of 1931 the\r\nannouncement of a birth control bill was like a message from Mars, only\r\nless interesting and more remote. The mind of each Senator resembled a\r\ntelephone switchboard with his wary secretary as the operator. All the\r\nwires were tied up with foreign debts, unemployment relief, reparations,\r\nmoratoriums, sales taxes, prohibition, budgets and bonuses, war in\r\nManchuria, peace conferences, disarmament, and the tariff—issues of\r\nvital concern to themselves for which they needed every vote; and their\r\nprincipal endeavor was not to cause conflict or get themselves disliked.\r\nWhat chance had we to plug in?\r\n\r\nWhen the vigilant secretary found we were not direct constituents, we\r\nwere told the Senator was busy—in conference, in committee, meeting an\r\narriving delegation. Would we come back later, tomorrow, next week?\r\nAlways we came back promptly and on the dot. For months it was almost\r\nimpossible to see any of them. Often as many as forty calls were made,\r\nand if we succeeded in getting two interviews, we considered that a good\r\nday’s work. When finally we did reach them, few of the younger, still\r\nfewer of the older, Senators knew what we were talking about. When we\r\nwere able to make this clear, young and old alike, just as in the state\r\nlegislatures, were full of fears—fear of prejudices, fear of cloakroom\r\njoshings, mainly fear of Catholic opposition.\r\n\r\nThough Senator Norris had approved the repeal bill, he believed that\r\nours had a better chance of passing because antagonism to the former was\r\neven greater than in 1926. He himself had Muscle Shoals and the Lame\r\nDuck Amendment on his hands and several more pet projects to boot, and\r\nsuggested we get somebody to introduce the bill who would not be up for\r\nre-election. Our choice fell on Senator Frederick Huntington Gillett of\r\nMassachusetts, for years Speaker of the House, and now about to retire.\r\nHe was a gentleman born, gray-haired, typically New England, without\r\nchildren or any particular philosophy regarding birth control. Our\r\nSouthern helpers, notably Mrs. J. B. Vandeveer, were persistent and\r\ndetermined. They would not be put off with polite, routine dismissals,\r\nbut asked point-blank, “Will you introduce this bill for us?” Senator\r\nGillett, recognizing their earnestness, agreed. But we heard no more of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned at the next session of the same Congress someone\r\nremarked, “Aren’t you lucky to have had your bill introduced?”\r\n\r\n“What?” I stared with wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Senator Gillett remembered it a few days before the session\r\nclosed.”\r\n\r\nI called on him at once. “Where’s our bill gone?”\r\n\r\nIt had gone nowhere. “We’ll just send it around to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee,” said the Senator. “Norris is Chairman and he’s friendly.\r\nHe’ll pick out a good sub-committee for you.”\r\n\r\nWe gathered our witnesses together the night before the hearing, which\r\nwas to be February 13th, and asked, “What do you want to say? How long\r\ndo you want in which to say it?” We had eight people to testify in the\r\nspace of two hours; moments had to be carefully parceled out to each. We\r\nwere permitted to deduct ten from our allotment the first day to be used\r\nthe following one for a rebuttal.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Borah of Idaho and Sam G. Bratton of New Mexico had been\r\nassigned to us with Senator Gillett, but Borah did not appear. The\r\naudience, mostly women, crowded the committee room, imposing with marble\r\npillars, glossy mahogany, gleaming windows.\r\n\r\nDr. John Whitridge Williams, obstetrician in chief of Johns Hopkins,\r\nsummed up the medical evidence for birth control. “A doctor who has this\r\ninformation (prevention of conception) and does not give it cannot help\r\nfeeling he is taking a responsibility for the lives and welfare of large\r\nnumbers of people.” The Reverend Charles Francis Potter, founder of the\r\nHumanist Society of New York, discussed the moral phase. “The bird of\r\nwar is not the eagle but the stork.” Professor Roswell H. Johnson, then\r\nat the University of Pittsburgh, stressed eugenics. “Most intelligent,\r\nwell-informed people ... are so determined in this (spacing children)\r\nthat no laws yet devised succeed in forcing a natural family, which is\r\nabout eighteen children, upon them.” Rabbi Sidney Goldstein dealt with\r\nreligious aspects. “The population is not made up of those who are born\r\nbut is made up of those who survive.” Professor of Sociology Henry Pratt\r\nFairchild spoke from the economic point of view. “We human individuals\r\ncannot break laws of nature. We can, however, choose which of her laws\r\nwe see fit to obey.” Mrs. Douglas Moffatt announced that the\r\ntwenty-seven hundred members of the New York City Junior League were\r\noverwhelmingly in favor of the bill.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the opposition began by trying to prove that we who\r\nadvocated birth control, a Russian innovation, were seeking to pull down\r\nmotherhood and the family as had been done in Russia. The Honorable Mary\r\nT. Norton, Representative from New Jersey, made the astounding assertion\r\nthat the happiest family was the big one, and that a large percentage of\r\nthe great men and women of this country were born poor; this was a\r\nblessing since it fired them with ambition. And she mentioned Abraham\r\nLincoln, whose birthday had been but two days before. I was particularly\r\noutraged by hearing statements from other witnesses that the American\r\nFederation of Labor was against us, that the American Medical\r\nAssociation was antagonistic, and that the Methodist and other churches\r\nwere going to help defeat our bill. Speaker after speaker representing\r\nCatholic organizations repeatedly hurled such dramatic tirades as, “I\r\nask you, gentlemen, in the name of the twenty million Catholic citizens\r\nof the country, to whose deep religious convictions these vices are\r\nabhorrent, and of all those to whom the virtue of a mother or a daughter\r\nis sacred, to report unfavorably on this diabolical and damnable bill!”\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to gauge the impression that was being made; you could\r\nonly sense that the response was one of feeling. These dogmatists,\r\nharking back to the Dark Ages, summoned to their aid the same arguments\r\nthat had been used to hinder every advance in our civilization—that it\r\nwas against nature, against God, against the Bible, against the\r\ncountry’s best interests, and against morality. Even though you proved\r\nyour case by statistics and reason and every known device of the human\r\nmind, the opponents parroted the line of attack over and over again; in\r\nthe end you realized that the appeal to intelligence was futile.\r\n\r\nOn occasions like this the inward fury that possessed me warmed from\r\ncoldness to white heat; it did not produce oratory, but it enabled me to\r\nmove others. The way to meet the opposition was to keep emotions in hand\r\nand, at the same time, without stumbling or fumbling, to let them go.\r\nEvery word I said was calculated and thought through, not in advance,\r\nbut as it came along. I did not react this way often, but I did that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen my ten minutes for rebuttal came, I knew that emotional speed was\r\nrequired. Nevertheless, I first knocked down their false assertions:\r\nthat the birth control movement had originated in this country during\r\n1914, long before anyone had ever heard of Bolshevism; that the\r\nobjections of the American Federation of Labor had referred to the\r\nrepeal bill of 1925, quite different from the doctors’ bill now under\r\ndiscussion; that the American Medical Association had taken no stand,\r\nbut two of its most important branches, the Neurological and Woman’s\r\nMedical, had gone on record in our favor; that Dr. C. I. Wilson of the\r\nMethodist Board had denied his church was opposed, and, in fact, its\r\nministers had worked unofficially for us. “When someone says that the\r\nhappiest families are the largest ones, and that the world’s great\r\nleaders have been of large families, I would like to call to your\r\nattention that the great leader of Christianity, Jesus Christ himself,\r\nwas said to be an only child.” Here the Catholics crossed themselves and\r\nmuttered, ‘Blasphemy!’\r\n\r\n“These opponents have had the laws with them, the wealth, the press, and\r\nyet they have come today to say they are afraid of the morals of their\r\npeople if they have knowledge, if they do not continue to be kept in\r\nfear and ignorance. Then I say their moral teachings are not very deep.\r\nMr. Chairman, we say that we want children conceived in love, born of\r\nparents’ conscious desire, and born into the world with sound bodies and\r\nsound minds.”\r\n\r\nThe two Senators sat there in silence. The bill was killed, due to the\r\nadverse vote of Senator Borah—who had not attended the hearings.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1932, Senator Gillett was gone and a substitute had to be\r\nfound. Believing the first woman Senator would be on the side of her\r\nsex, we asked Mrs. Hattie Caraway to introduce the bill. She said she\r\nherself was interested in the subject, but her secretary would not let\r\nher touch it.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily Congressmen paid little attention to abstract arguments,\r\nlogic, or the humanitarian needs of outsiders. But they could be reached\r\nthrough their constituents. One way of doing this was to get women “back\r\nhome” to help themselves directly by writing letters. This required\r\nmoney. We sought it from a foundation which donated ten thousand dollars\r\nearmarked for this special purpose. To the still continuing stream of\r\nletters from mothers, requesting as always contraceptive advice, my\r\nreply went, “I would gladly give you the information you ask for if the\r\nlaw permitted. Your Congressman now has the opportunity to vote on this\r\nbill. Send him a letter telling how many children you have living, how\r\nmany babies dead, how many abortions, what wages your husband receives,\r\neverything you have told me,” and I enclosed an envelope, stamped and\r\naddressed to their respective Congressmen.\r\n\r\nWhile walking one day through the tunnel which connected the House with\r\nthe Senate, I stopped to ask a man my direction. He said, “I’m going\r\nyour way. Come along and I’ll show you.”\r\n\r\nWe fell into conversation. He informed me he was a Senator, and asked\r\nwhat I was doing.\r\n\r\n“I’m working on the birth control bill.”\r\n\r\n“That’s funny. I’ve just had a letter from a woman five miles from where\r\nI’ve lived most of my life. Listen to this.”\r\n\r\nAnd he took it out of his pocket and read the history of the woman’s\r\nabortions and operations. “I’ve never heard anything quite so awful, and\r\nat the bottom she says, ‘You can help me by getting this law changed,\r\nand Mrs. Sanger, who has the information, will send it to me if you get\r\nthe law changed.’”\r\n\r\nThese letters brought fine results. Through them Senator Henry D.\r\nHatfield of West Virginia was persuaded to introduce the bill. At the\r\nhearing he described how as physician and surgeon and governor of his\r\nstate he had seen the free mating of the unfit, and had forced through a\r\nsterilization law. We produced our usual array of experts, and the\r\nopposition produced Dr. Howard Atwood Kelly, a famous gynecologist in\r\nhis day at Johns Hopkins, but now Professor Emeritus and very old, who\r\nrambled discursively on morals; his was a state of mind if not of\r\nreason. Dr. John A. Ryan, a member of the National Catholic Welfare\r\nConference, chose economics for his discussion. Neither spoke on his own\r\nsubject, but selected something on which he was not an authority.\r\n\r\nThe bill was killed in committee, and the one introduced by\r\nRepresentative Frank Hancock of North Carolina in the House got into the\r\nwrong committee so nothing happened.\r\n\r\nBefore you had seen it, the Congress of the United States loomed\r\nimpressively in your consciousness; you had a feeling, “This is the\r\ngreatest country in the world, this is its Government, I helped to send\r\nthese men here.” Then you watched Congress at work, listened to it, and\r\nwere disillusioned. A few years of sitting in the gallery and looking\r\ndown gave you less respect for the quality of our representatives, less\r\nfaith in legislative action, and you wondered whether those who had\r\nalready abandoned hope of obtaining relief in this way and resorted to\r\ndirect action had not, perhaps, the right idea.\r\n\r\nThe same arguments went on from year to year. A certain amount of\r\npublicity was secured, a certain number were educated. Some of our\r\nfollowers, in face of the evidence to the contrary, still were confident\r\nthat if the Catholics understood our bill they would not obstruct it.\r\nThey said Representative Arthur D. Healey of Massachusetts, a member of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee, although a Catholic was so liberal that if he\r\ncould once be made to see the reasons back of it he would cease being\r\nopenly hostile, and it might even get out of committee. Accordingly, I\r\nwent to his office; we talked at length, and again got nowhere. As I was\r\nleaving this father of four said, in order to explain himself, “You see,\r\nMrs. Sanger, I’m just one of those unusual men who are very fond of\r\nchildren.” I was inwardly convulsed at the thought that he considered\r\nhimself unusual and that we were all a lot of Herods trying to do away\r\nwith babies.\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed that I was to have greater success as the result of\r\nmy interview with Dr. Joseph J. Mundell, Professor of Obstetrics at\r\nGeorgetown University, who advised the Catholic Welfare Conference on\r\nall their medical legislation. In a private session I conceded some\r\nthings in the bill; Dr. Mundell gave up certain others. The compromise\r\napparently suited everybody.\r\n\r\nIn 1934 identical bills were introduced in Senate and House, the latter\r\nby Representative Walter M. Pierce, Democrat, who as Governor of Oregon\r\nhad burned his political bridges by vetoing a bill which permitted\r\nparochial schools. Since he had nothing to lose, he did not have to play\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nHatton W. Summers of Texas was chairman of the hearing. Our side led\r\noff, again specialists in each line covering the vital points. Rabbi\r\nEdward L. Israel of Baltimore made an impassioned plea. “And I say,\r\ngentlemen, if this thing we are now advocating is not morally right, let\r\nus stop being hypocrites and, in its place, put a law on our statute\r\nbooks that will drive contraceptive devices out of your homes and mine.”\r\n\r\nHere John C. Lehr of Michigan, sitting back in his chair with thumbs\r\nhitched in his suspenders, declared pompously, “As a member of this\r\nCommittee I want to go on record there have never been any\r\ncontraceptives used in my home. I have six children, too.”\r\n\r\nMalcolm C. Tarver of Georgia interrupted, “You don’t mean any member of\r\nCongress has used anything of that kind, do you?” His surprise was\r\nobviously genuine.\r\n\r\nThe proponents of our bill, even elderly women, had stood while\r\ndelivering their testimony. But when Father Charles E. Coughlin entered,\r\ncheeks very pink over his black collar, a chair was placed for him,\r\nbecause as a representative of the Church he would not stand before a\r\nrepresentative body of the State. He began talking at random, “I have\r\nnot heard one word of the testimony these ladies and gentlemen have\r\nproduced, and my remarks are not addressed to them now, because I can\r\neasily handle them over the radio Sunday after Sunday.... You,\r\ngentlemen, you are married men, all of you, and you know more about it\r\nthan I will ever know.” Here he arched his eyebrows into a leer. “The\r\nChairman, I understand, is a bachelor like myself.... We know how these\r\ncontraceptives are bootlegged in the corner drug stores surrounding our\r\nhigh schools. Why are they around the high schools? To teach them how to\r\nfornicate and not get caught. All this bill means is ‘How to commit\r\nadultery and not get caught.’”\r\n\r\nSome of our sympathizers walked out of the room. Two Congressmen left\r\nthe table. But we were a polite, well-behaved group that shrank from\r\nscenes, and, though furious and indignant, we allowed him to conclude\r\nhis half-hour of grossness.\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my ears when Dr. Mundell, who shortly before had\r\nhelped us formulate a bill which he said was satisfactory to him, rose\r\nand deliberately betrayed us by stating there was no need for\r\nlegislation whatsoever, because a recent scientific work—by which he\r\nmeant _Rhythm_—had shown that fertility in women could be reckoned with\r\nalmost mathematical precision.\r\n\r\nIn the rebuttal Dr. Prentiss Willson testified that the theory of the\r\ncycle of sterility had no medical standing. Then came my turn. I had in\r\nmy pocket a copy of _Rhythm_, and quoted from it. Under the heading of\r\nprocreation it asked whether married people were obliged to bring into\r\nthe world all the children they could, and then made answer:\r\n\r\n  Far from being an obligation, such a course may be utterly\r\n  indefensible. Broadly speaking, married couples have not the right\r\n  to bring into the world children whom they are unable to support,\r\n  for they would thereby inflict a grievous damage upon society.\r\n\r\nI told the committee that apparently the only distinction in the pros\r\nand cons of the birth control question was that the method we advocated\r\nwas a scientific one under the supervision of doctors; that of the\r\nCatholics had not been proved scientifically and was open to any boy or\r\ngirl who could read the English language.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the bill again died in committee.\r\n\r\nThe Senate hearings on the bill, introduced by our old friend Daniel O.\r\nHastings of Delaware, did not come until March. We presented our\r\nadvocates, among them a miner’s wife from West Virginia, the native\r\nstate of two members of the committee, Hatfield and Nealy. She was a\r\nperfect illustration of the type which most needed birth control. When\r\nshe had finished a Catholic woman asked her, “Which of your nine\r\nchildren would you rather see dead?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t want to see any of them dead. I love them all; but I don’t\r\nlove those I haven’t had.”\r\n\r\nHer reply was just right; it could not have been better.\r\n\r\nVito Silecchia, my former coal and ice vendor from Fourteenth Street,\r\nalso made his way to Washington and told his simple story. His wife had\r\ncome to me when pregnant with her fourth child, and I had said I could\r\ndo nothing for her until she had had her baby. Now, many years\r\nafterwards, she had no more than the four. Vito reasoned his case as a\r\nman, “I am a Catholic myself. The Catholics say we should have much\r\nchildren. I say different. I say it is not good to have too many\r\nchildren. You can’t take care of them.” He ended by describing the\r\nmother of six who lived next door to him. “I told her, ‘I will take you\r\nto a place. It is a wonderful place.’ She does not know the English\r\nlanguage. Therefore, she has never come up to see Mrs. Sanger, but she\r\nwill—but she will!”\r\n\r\nFor the first time the Senate sub-committee reported out the bill and it\r\nwas put on the unanimous consent calendar. The last day of the session\r\ncame, June 13th. Over two hundred were ahead of it, but there was always\r\nhope. One after another they were hurried through and then, miracle of\r\nmiracles, ours passed with no voice raised against it. The next one came\r\nup, was also converted into law, another up for discussion, tabled.\r\nTwenty minutes went by. Suddenly Senator Pat McCarran from Reno, Nevada,\r\nfamous divorce lawyer though an outstanding Catholic, came rushing in\r\nfrom the cloak room and asked for unanimous consent to recall our bill.\r\nAs a matter of senatorial courtesy Senator Hastings granted his request;\r\nhad he not done so Senator McCarran would have objected to every bill he\r\nintroduced thereafter. It was summarily referred back to the committee\r\nand there died.\r\n\r\nIn 1935 we took the fatal step of having it voted on early in the\r\nsession and it was promptly killed. The whole year’s labor was lost. The\r\nfollowing winter, when I was in India, Percy Gassaway of Oklahoma\r\nintroduced a bill in the House, Royal S. Copeland of New York, in the\r\nSenate, by request; neither one reached a hearing.\r\n\r\nAnother line of attack on the Comstock law was to try for a liberal\r\ninterpretation through the courts. Among the products shown at the\r\nZurich Conference in 1930 had been a Japanese pessary. Pursuing the\r\nclinic policy of testing every new contraceptive that appeared, I\r\nordered some of these from a Tokyo physician. When notified by the\r\nCustoms that they had been barred entrance and destroyed, we sent for\r\nanother shipment addressed to Dr. Stone in the hope that it would then\r\nbe delivered to a physician. But this also was refused, and accordingly\r\nwe brought suit in her name.\r\n\r\nAfter pending two years the case finally came up for trial before Judge\r\nGrover Moscowitz of the Federal District Court of Southern New York.\r\nMorris Ernst conducted our claim brilliantly, and January 6, 1936, Judge\r\nMoscowitz decided in our favor—the wording of the statute seemed to\r\nforbid the importation of any article for preventing conception, but he\r\nbelieved that the statute should be construed more reasonably. The\r\nGovernment at once appealed and the case was argued in the Circuit Court\r\nof Appeals before Judges Augustus N. Hand, Learned Hand, and Thomas\r\nSwan, whose unanimous decisions were rarely reversed in the Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1936, while I was in Washington getting the Federal bill\r\nstarted again in advance of Congress’ meeting, news came that the three\r\njudges had upheld the Moscowitz decision and had added that a doctor was\r\nentitled not only to bring articles into this country but, more\r\nimportant, to send them through the mails, and, finally, to use them for\r\nthe patient’s general well-being—which, for twenty years, had been the\r\nobject of my earnest endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe Government still had the right to appeal inside of ninety days.\r\nTherefore, I was not unduly jubilant. We had had so many seeming\r\nvictories that melted away afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut long before the period of grace had expired, Attorney General\r\nCummings announced to the press that the Government would accept the\r\ndecision as law, and, with commendable consistency, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury sent word to the Customs at once that our shipments should be\r\nadmitted. It is really a relief to be able to say something good about\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the court decision there was little point at this time in\r\ncontinuing the Federal campaign. The money for closing it up came\r\nthrough a most unexpected and affecting channel. About a year after I\r\nhad seen Viola Kaufman at the California Conference in 1931, I received\r\na letter from her asking me please to write out the form in which I\r\nwould like any money left so that she could designate it in her will. I\r\ntook her clear, concise note to my attorney who suggested that, since\r\norganizations were many and might go out of existence at any moment, it\r\nwould be wiser to have the bequest in my name to be dispensed for any\r\npurpose within the movement I saw fit. I answered her to this effect and\r\nshe replied, “I am now passing over to you in my will whatever I\r\npossess.”\r\n\r\nI considered that the only courteous thing to do was to have Anna\r\nLifshiz, who was living in Los Angeles, go to see Miss Kaufman. The\r\naddress was in the Mexican district, in the poorest, most dilapidated,\r\nrun-down section. In patched clothes she came to the door of her house,\r\nin which there was hardly any furniture. She was formal and rather cold.\r\n\r\nAnna merely explained the reason for her call was that she knew Miss\r\nKaufman as one of our subscribers. She wrote me, “That poor creature\r\nhasn’t money enough to keep body and soul together.”\r\n\r\nTwo years went by. I was in Washington, preparing to start for Boston\r\nfor a meeting when a messenger boy delivered a telegram from the\r\ndirector of the General Hospital at Memphis, Tennessee, requesting me to\r\ncome at once; Viola Kaufman was dangerously ill with pneumonia and\r\nasking for me. I looked up trains; it would take forty-eight hours, and\r\nso I put in a long-distance call to the director, who told me she had\r\ndied during the night.\r\n\r\n“What was she doing in Memphis?”\r\n\r\n“We don’t know. The Salvation Army brought her in to us. She has only a\r\nlittle cash tied up in a handkerchief. We can’t do anything without you\r\nbecause you’re the beneficiary.”\r\n\r\nThe undertaker also wanted an order from me, and, since her executor, an\r\nofficer of a bank in Los Angeles, had gone on a fishing trip, I arranged\r\nthe details for her cremation. She had ordered that her remains be sent\r\nto me and when they arrived the clinic staff came up to Willow Lake and\r\nwe held a little memorial service of gratitude and respect, spreading\r\nthe ashes over the rock garden.\r\n\r\nTo everybody’s astonishment Viola Kaufman had about thirty thousand\r\ndollars in Los Angeles realty. But it took a year and a half to settle\r\nthe estate and by this time everything was at the lowest ebb of the\r\ndepression. We received approximately twelve thousand dollars. I have\r\nnever looked at the obituaries for the last twenty years without hoping\r\nto read that someone has willed a million dollars for birth control, but\r\nthe only legacy ever bequeathed us was that saved from the meager\r\nearnings of this schoolteacher, Viola Kaufman, who herself lived in\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nWith this money we wrote finis to the Federal legislation. Of the old\r\norganization all that was left in Washington was a secretary to read the\r\n_Congressional Record_ daily—a watchdog to report any bills proposed\r\nwhich would make it necessary for us to jump into action to combat them.\r\n\r\nSix years of this work had cost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\r\nIt had also meant strain and worry beyond anything I had ever\r\nattempted—never being able to detach myself from it whether Congress was\r\nin session or not, always on the alert to discover any new person\r\nelected who might be favorably disposed. Now and again it had been\r\ndiscouraging; you could exert yourself to the utmost with pleasure if it\r\nwere a matter of convincing a person and watching his mind being pried\r\nopen, but here, over and over again, you saw this same conviction, yet\r\nhe reverted to the same fears and refrained from doing anything.\r\n\r\nHowever, the process of enlightening legislators had also unclosed the\r\neyes of an enormous number of organizations. First to approve publicly\r\nhad been the National Council of Jewish Women. Eventually more than a\r\nthousand clubs—civic, political, religious, and social, including the\r\nGeneral Federation of Women’s Clubs, the Y.W.C.A., local Junior\r\nLeagues—in all representing between twelve and thirteen million\r\nmembers—had given their endorsement. And, more important than anything\r\nelse, the public had been educated persistently, consistently away from\r\ncasual and precarious contraceptive advice into the qualified hands of\r\nthe medical profession.\r\n\r\nDr. Dickinson had been appearing regularly at American Medical\r\nAssociation meetings, keeping the question constantly alive. But not\r\nuntil Dr. Prentiss Willson had formed a national body of doctors in 1935\r\nto carry on legislative work had there been any action. One had stirred\r\nup; the other organized.\r\n\r\nI was at Willow Lake one June morning of 1937 when I saw spread across\r\nthe newspaper in double column the glad tidings: the Committee on\r\nContraception of the American Medical Association had informed the\r\nconvention that physicians had the legal right to give contraceptives,\r\nand it recommended that standards be investigated and technique be\r\ntaught in medical schools.\r\n\r\nIn my excitement I actually fell downstairs. To me this was really a\r\ngreater victory than the Moscowitz decision. Here was the culmination of\r\nunremitting labor ever since my return from Europe in 1915, the\r\ngratification of seeing a dream come true.\r\n\r\nThese specific achievements are significant because they open the way to\r\na broader field of attainment and to research which can immeasurably\r\nimprove methods now known, making possible the spread of birth control\r\ninto the forlorn, overpopulated places of the earth, and permitting\r\nscience eventually to determine the potentialities of a posterity\r\nconceived and born of conscious love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-five_\r\n\r\n                      A PAST WHICH IS GONE FOREVER\r\n\r\n\r\nParenthood remains unquestionably the most serious of all human\r\nrelationships, the most far-reaching in its power for good or for evil,\r\nand withal the most delicately complex. I always tried to secure my\r\nsons’ confidence by being honest with them, treating them as though they\r\nhad intelligence, and expecting them to use it. For the sake of\r\ncompanionship it was essential to be honest, no matter what the cost.\r\nFortunately, the younger generation is not crumpled up when sharply\r\nconfronted with the truth. They have cut through the regard to their\r\nfeelings until they can say extraordinarily blunt things to each other\r\nand yet not be hurt. And with this they have invented a new language;\r\nthey can “take it.”\r\n\r\nMany times I could have forced my opinion on the boys and saved Fern\r\nperhaps some bitter disappointments—“Let me do it. I’ll manage all this.\r\nLet me know when you need anything.” But, instead, I merely stated my\r\nattitude and said, “Here are the two alternatives. You want this; I\r\nthink the other is better. Neither of us can tell which is right. If you\r\nchoose your own way I’ll help you as long as you do it well, providing\r\nyou stop as soon as you know it is wrong and go back and pick up the\r\nother. If experience teaches you a greater wisdom, you can call it\r\nsquare.”\r\n\r\nAt Peddie Institute, Stuart was paying more attention to sports than\r\nstudies. It was easy for him to be an athlete. But he also had a logical\r\nmind and a quick ability for co-ordinating hand and brain. When he was\r\nready for college he entered Sheffield Scientific School of Yale\r\nUniversity. His imagination was soon captured by archaeology and\r\nmedicine, but his course was already set.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Grant, who had been inclined to hero-worship his older\r\nbrother, had also gone to Peddie. His athletics left little opportunity\r\nfor bringing out his artistic talents, and he agreed to take his last\r\ntwo years at Westminster School in Simsbury, Connecticut, where he was\r\nencouraged to develop along his own lines. In his sophomore year at\r\nPrinceton, he still had no idea of what he wanted to do with his life.\r\nAlthough he had a leaning towards diplomacy, which would include\r\ntraining in law, I explained to him that, since the family had no\r\npolitical influence, it might lead to being a small politician.\r\n\r\nAnd so I made out a list of as many occupations known to man as I could\r\nthink of, and sent them to him, telling him to mark off with a blue\r\npencil those which he was perfectly sure did not appeal to him, and\r\ncheck with red those for which he felt some predilection. Out\r\nimmediately went piano-mover, waiter, floorwalker, bank manager,\r\nbookkeeper, and some fifty others.\r\n\r\nSix months later, I returned him the red-checked list for further\r\nperusal. Now his preferences were much more definite. Research,\r\njournalism, editorial work, diplomacy were again red, but almost\r\neverything else marked headed him for a scientific career.\r\n\r\nThe decision made, Grant began his pre-medical course.\r\n\r\nAfter Stuart graduated from Yale he moved downtown to Wall Street and\r\ncontinued in a broker’s office all during the depression. But, in this\r\nmoney making atmosphere, his attitude was changing. He had concluded\r\nthat serving humanity was a higher fulfillment than profiting at\r\nhumanity’s expense, and medicine seemed the career which he also liked\r\nbest. Having found out, he had the courage to start back at the\r\nbeginning to accomplish it. We made a compact for him to go as far as he\r\ncould and test whether his interest kept up. First he had to acquire\r\nsufficient chemistry and biology, going to Columbia University in the\r\ndaytime for the former, to New York University in the evening for the\r\nlatter, preparing his lessons until three in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe next year he passed his entrance examinations.\r\n\r\nFollowing the legislative near-victory in the winter of 1934, I resolved\r\nto go to Russia to see for myself what was happening in the greatest\r\nsocial experiment of our age. With keen anticipation I looked forward to\r\ndiscovering whether the Marxian philosophy, dramatized and realized and\r\nbased on an economic ideology, did not have to accept some of the\r\nphilosophy of Malthus.\r\n\r\nGrant, then about to enter his final year at Cornell Medical School, was\r\neager to investigate the progress of medicine in the Soviet Union, and\r\nmade up his mind to come along. I was taking also my secretary, Florence\r\nRose, efficient, competent in any capacity, whether field organizing or\r\nin the office. Though but recently enlisted in the movement, she had\r\ncome more with the attitude of the early days, not for what she could\r\nget out of it, but for what she could give to its furtherance. Her\r\ntalents and enthusiasm, when added to her cheerfulness, made her a rare\r\ncombination; always gleeful and bubbling with fun, she carried out\r\nnearly everything in that spirit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ethel Clyde, an officer of the Federal legislative organization,\r\nwas to be the fourth of our little group within a large group. When zeal\r\nfor the “new civilization” in Russia had been at its height she had\r\nrelinquished her expensive Park Avenue apartment for a smaller one on a\r\nside street, and contributed the difference in rent to sundry leftist\r\ncauses and birth control.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment it seemed we might not be able to go. For some years\r\nStuart had had a bad sinus condition, and hardly had he matriculated at\r\nCornell in the fall of 1933 when he had been struck by a squash racket,\r\nfracturing the bone over his eye. That winter he had been operated on\r\nnine times. A week before I was due to sail this doctor advised that he\r\nhave an exploratory operation. I rushed up from Washington, where the\r\nlegislative work for that session was just being wound up, and would\r\nhave abandoned the Russian expedition had not the operation apparently\r\nbeen entirely successful. Stuart insisted that I go. Since he was in no\r\ndanger I continued with my plans.\r\n\r\nIt was not feasible to travel in Russia except in a party under official\r\nguidance. Three people I knew who had gone by themselves described how\r\ntrain after train had passed them, boat after boat had steamed down the\r\nVolga with no accommodations available. Therefore, we chose the\r\nnon-partisan Second Russian Seminar.\r\n\r\nShortly prior to leaving I spent an evening with Maurice Hindus, Will\r\nDurant, John Kingsbury, and Drs. Hannah and Abraham Stone, all of whom\r\nhad been to Russia the previous year. Maurice Hindus had returned\r\nimpersonal and still unprejudiced, Will Durant utterly antagonistic,\r\nJohn Kingsbury full of fervor, and both Stones warmly disposed. They had\r\nall been in Moscow, practically at the same time, for approximately the\r\nsame number of days, and all had received utterly dissimilar\r\nimpressions. Even pictures that Will Durant had taken were not the same\r\nas those of John Kingsbury or Dr. Stone, snapped from almost identical\r\nplaces, thus showing me how wide might be the variety of responses,\r\ndepending on the individual bias.\r\n\r\nI expected to keep my eyes open, to think independently, to ask\r\nquestions, and compare. I was going to use as much sanity and fairness\r\nas I possessed, and not be swept emotionally into any current of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nBilly Barber was the manager of the Seminar, and I did not envy him his\r\njob. There were many complaints and stupid remarks and much\r\nfaultfinding. Most of the party were going merely to be able to say\r\nthose things were true which they had previously said were true. I asked\r\none woman who went on every sight-seeing expedition but never got out of\r\nthe bus, “Why did you come?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, just to wipe Russia off my list.”\r\n\r\nEdward Alsworth Ross was among the leaders. He was the only person who\r\nhad been there under the former regime some twenty years earlier, and\r\nhad an authoritative basis of contrast between the old and the new; we\r\nall rather sat at his feet. He was a typical professor, wore enormously\r\nhigh, stiff collars, played checkers with anybody who would indulge him,\r\nand was upset when he failed to win. His personality was impressive,\r\nliterally so because wherever you looked you spied him. One of the\r\nfunniest sights was to see this Nordic giant, six feet four, walking\r\nwith short dark Florence Rose, five feet two, each jollying the other.\r\n\r\nWe scooted through England across to Copenhagen, about which I recall\r\nvery little. I was always trying to learn what advance the women’s\r\nmovement had made, but somebody was always trying to tell me how\r\nmarvelous the city was. Remembering Ellen Key, I reached Scandinavia\r\nwith great hopes for Feminism. But the women who were considered the\r\nmost intelligent were complacently resting on their laurels. The older\r\nones still reigned supreme and believed that, because they had won their\r\nbattles of twenty-five years ago, there was nothing left to fight for.\r\nThe younger group found it hard to rise above the inertia of this\r\noverwhelming prestige. Since population was not a problem in\r\nScandinavia, they were interested chiefly in eugenics, and had almost\r\nforgotten the aspect of individual suffering.\r\n\r\nAt Oslo a number of us went on pilgrimage to the grave of Ibsen. As I\r\nstood there in silent tribute I had the feeling he had understood women\r\nand the ties they had been loosening. To my mind Nora never went back to\r\nthe “doll’s house”; her evolution was too complete. Or, if she did\r\nreturn, she entered by another door.\r\n\r\nMr. Barber had arranged to feed his hundred and six charges at the last\r\nFinnish railroad station. There was a particular exhilaration about the\r\nprospect of that meal, because it was to be our final one before\r\ncrossing into “famine-stricken” Russia. We arrived at ten in the\r\nmorning, all of us hungry. As we filed into the station our eyes met the\r\nmost gorgeous panorama—long tables beautifully laid out with delicious\r\nmeats, fish, breads, compotes.\r\n\r\nWhile we paused, debating which of these delicacies to taste first,\r\nthere came a stampede of fifty other Americans, a tourist group led by\r\nSherwood Eddy. Never had I seen such an exhibition. The men, unshaven,\r\nhatless, coatless, pushed and shoved around, in front of, and almost on\r\ntop of the tables. The best we could do was find comfortable seats from\r\nwhich we could have a good view of the riot. The meal prepared by the\r\nrailroad with such courtesy for our party was demolished by another.\r\n\r\nBarber and Eddy eventually discovered it was all a mistake. The train\r\ncarrying the Eddy-ites had failed to stop at the town where their repast\r\nhad been awaiting them, and naturally they supposed this breakfast was\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nAt Leningrad we were met by buses and driven through streets that\r\nswarmed with imperturbable, peasant-like people. The upper parts of\r\ntheir Mongolian-shaped heads all looked exactly the same. I noticed how\r\nimmaculate they were. Faces, necks, hands, were white as white and\r\ndisplayed a cleanliness simply marvelous when you took into\r\nconsideration the difficulty of securing soap and water. Very few were\r\nold; many were children apparently between the ages of two to twelve.\r\nBut in the expressions of all I glimpsed a sadness.\r\n\r\nThe former capital was depressing and down at heels, shabby and in need\r\nof painting. Yet it was beyond comparison in its spacious dignity; the\r\narchitectural design of the houses could not be hidden. My\r\nhigh-ceilinged room at the Astoria was luxurious with alcove bed, bath\r\nroom, and large marble tub, which, although cracked and spotted with\r\nrust, nevertheless evidenced the days of splendor when the hotel had\r\nbeen frequented by the aristocracy of the Old Regime.\r\n\r\nFrom my window I could see the cobbled square. It was eight o’clock and\r\nthe city was awakening. I watched the passing show: heavy wagons were\r\ndrawn by a single and often most decrepit horse with what seemed a dark\r\nbrown rainbow, arched and graceful, over his neck; queues formed in\r\nfront of little stands that served rations of beer or bottled soda\r\nwater; some women, the varying colors in their shawls making bright\r\nsplotches, swept the car tracks with birch switches or pushed empty\r\ncarts on their way to market, others carried hods of cement up the\r\nladders to the masons on the new buildings being erected everywhere.\r\nUsually the men were doing the skilled work, and women, hardy and\r\nrobust, with strong legs, bare feet, sunburned faces, were kept at the\r\nlaborious, monotonous, physical labor until such time as they could\r\nqualify as expert artisans.\r\n\r\nThe Communists’ apartments were much better, lighter, airier, cleaner,\r\nmore modern than those for non-party members. When we asked why, in an\r\nequalitarian state, one section should be thus privileged, we were\r\nanswered, “It was they who made all this possible. Why should they not\r\nhave the best? What you bourgeois give to your capitalists, we give to\r\nour Communists.”\r\n\r\nWe asked Tanya, our guide, if she were a Communist, and she replied,\r\n“Oh, no. That’s too hard.” Ordinary citizens might be excused for a\r\nmistake or even a crime, but party members could have no human\r\nfrailties. They were exiled or perhaps shot for cheating, stealing,\r\ndeceiving, exploiting, taking money under false pretenses, or many\r\nthings which average people could do and be punished with fines alone.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cost of the trip itself was relatively low, whatever we\r\nbought in Russia was excessively high owing to the peculiar situation of\r\nthe ruble. In the first place, there was no ruble; it existed only in\r\ntheory. Second, every foreigner was supposed to deal exclusively with\r\nthe Torgsin stores through which the Government had cleverly contrived\r\nto come by a hoard of foreign currency by charging seventy-eight cents\r\nin our money for each ruble instead of its actual value of five cents.\r\nFor example, the price of a stamp on a letter to the United States,\r\nwhich was two and a half rubles, amounted to two dollars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clyde, who leaned sympathetically towards Communism, said to one of\r\nour young men, “Let me get you a little present.”\r\n\r\n“Not here,” he said. “It’ll be too expensive.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she insisted. “What would you like?”\r\n\r\n“Well—a bar of almond chocolate, then.”\r\n\r\nShe had to pay ten American dollars for that ten-cent bar of chocolate.\r\nHer Communism melted slightly.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we solved the ruble problem. One morning a boy who had been\r\nloitering around the Astoria asked Grant, “Would you like me to take you\r\nthrough the city?”\r\n\r\nGrant prudently inquired, “How much?” It appeared that the boy merely\r\ndesired an opportunity to perfect his English; he had plenty of rubles,\r\nwhich he was glad to dispose of at the rate of fifty for a dollar.\r\nRussians could obtain none but the cheapest commodities on their\r\ntickets; if they wanted luxuries such as good shirts, leather or rubber\r\nboots, and other articles sold only at Torgsin, they were obliged to\r\nsurrender some treasured gold piece or use foreign money.\r\n\r\nWith an ample supply of rubles I sent long, elaborate cables to Stuart\r\nto cheer him up. He must have thought an excessive maternal solicitude\r\nwas getting the better of my economic judgment. But, as a matter of\r\nfact, one of twenty words was costing me less than twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nDr. Nadina Kavanoky, who had been interested in birth control in the\r\nUnited States, had given me a letter to her father, Dr. Reinstein, once\r\na dentist in Rochester, New York, now in Stalin’s close confidence. He\r\ncame to see me about eleven-thirty one night, the Russian calling hour,\r\nand we talked until three in the morning. When he wanted to know my\r\n“impressions of Russia,” I said promptly, “It seems to me your policy of\r\novercharging us is a mistake; for the sake of a few dollars you are\r\ncreating ill will, just as the French have done. In our own Seminar we\r\nhave twenty librarians and perhaps double that number of schoolteachers\r\nand students, many of whom have gone without other vacations to come\r\nhere. They have a unique opportunity to influence people; everybody will\r\nask them when they get back, ‘Did you like Russia?’ You are trying to\r\nbuild up a favorable public opinion abroad, and these people are the\r\nbest mediums for that purpose. If they are pleased they will fight for\r\nyou and break down prejudice.”\r\n\r\nBut he was not convinced, and, evoking the specter of the Tsarist debt\r\nto America, he replied, “We’ll bleed you, we’ll milk you, we’ll get\r\nevery dollar out of you we can. America demands her pound of flesh and\r\nthis is how we’ll pay you.”\r\n\r\nThe occasions for receiving “pleasant impressions” were offered by\r\nvigorous tours to points of interest. We were given a choice of hard\r\nbuses or harder ones, all, in my experience, springless and clattering\r\nnoisily over the cobble-paved streets. After a few bumps we usually hit\r\nthe roof and came down with headaches. Our poor little guides had to\r\nscreech with full lung power to be heard over the incessant rattling.\r\n\r\nOne morning when driving back from sight-seeing, the motor gasped and\r\ncollapsed on a slight hill. Passengers volunteered helpful\r\nsuggestions—“Put it in low. Put it in neutral. Push this. Pull that.”\r\n\r\nThe driver moved gears forward and backward and then looked around at us\r\nin perplexity, “I did, but it won’t work.” We waited and waited and\r\nwaited and waited. Somebody ran a mile to telephone that we were\r\nstranded and needed another bus. Meanwhile, everything we wanted to see\r\nwas closing, and we had already learned that whatever you missed in\r\nRussia was always the most worth while. In fact, it seemed they had\r\nvisiting hours timed to end five minutes before you got there. Several\r\nother buses came along and stopped. Their drivers got out, poked their\r\nheads under the hood, began taking things apart, strewing bolts this way\r\nand nuts that. Then they, too, became discouraged, and, leaving\r\nincreased confusion, climbed on their chariots again and went on.\r\n\r\nFinally some bright young man discovered we were out of gas.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the huge square in front of the hotel, I saw directly\r\nahead of us an enormous pile of bricks with wide spaces on both sides.\r\nCloser and closer we came. “When will the driver turn?” I asked myself.\r\nBut he never did; we went right over the top and the bricks slipped out\r\nfrom under. That was the Russian system. You could not go round an\r\nobstacle; you must go over it.\r\n\r\nEnlarged portraits of Lenin and Stalin were in all public buildings.\r\nTheir statues were everywhere, in every square, on every corner. A major\r\nindustry of Russia seemed to be to find new poses for Stalin—standing\r\nup, lying down, writing, reading. Often just his head, definitely\r\nrecognizable in spite of the predominance of red, was designed in flower\r\nbeds. One of the most delicate attentions was to give him a different\r\ncolored necktie on different days; the plants were kept in pots to make\r\nthis charming gesture possible.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution when peace had come, connoisseurs from various\r\ncountries had been invited to examine the recovered statues, rugs,\r\ntapestries, and _objets d’art_ stolen from the palaces and churches. One\r\nby one the priceless paintings were displayed, specialists rendered\r\ntheir opinions, commercial dealers furnished appraisals, stenographers\r\ntook down every word. The same was done with the lapis lazuli tables,\r\nthe snuff boxes, the court jewels.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part of the new arrangement was that the interpretation\r\nwas entirely Marxian. Pictures, instead of being hung according to the\r\northodox history of art, were fitted into the Industrial Revolution. A\r\ncertain Madonna was not admired for its qualities of color or form, or\r\nas a thing of beauty in itself; the guide explained to you that it was\r\ncreated at such and such a time when the Church was trying to get a hold\r\nover the people, when artists were starving and had to look for their\r\nmeans of livelihood to the patronage of the Church.\r\n\r\nLater, in the Kremlin at Moscow we saw fantastic and incredible riches,\r\njeweled saddles, a whole set of harness studded with turquoise, a huge\r\ncasket cloth embroidered with thousands of pearls. In order to place the\r\nperiod of the latter I asked Tanya where it had come from. She replied\r\nin her precise English, “You see, it is for to cover the dead. You see,\r\nin Russia there was such a custom. When they died they put them in the\r\nground. It was such a custom, you see, to cover them with cloths.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke of the Tsarist Regime as though it had been centuries ago.\r\n\r\nOne of the pictures was a Christ removed from the cross and lying on the\r\nground. Tanya said, “People used to come here, and they even kissed it!”\r\nThis she uttered in the tone of scorn of a very youthful generation\r\nshocked and horrified at the ancient traditions.\r\n\r\n“Our hope is in the young people,” she said frequently.\r\n\r\n“But how old are you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m thirty-two,” as though she were doddering.\r\n\r\nGrant and I were once walking by a group of children when a small boy\r\npointed at us and remarked, “Ah, there go some of the dying race.” To\r\nthem all _Amerikanski_ were capitalists.\r\n\r\nThe Marxian ideology had been applied to every phase of life. H.G.,\r\naccompanied by Gyp, his biologist son, had flown over from London. Since\r\nhe wanted an opportunity to go around alone, he rather resented being so\r\nclosely guarded and courteously guided. After talking with Stalin he had\r\ncome to the conclusion that the Dictator had no understanding of\r\neconomics. He was somewhat annoyed at the constant interpretation of\r\neverything in terms of politics, and of having Marx stuffed down his\r\nthroat at every turn.\r\n\r\nAt the schools you might ask what kind of mathematics they taught.\r\n\r\n“Marx.”\r\n\r\n“And what system of engineering?”\r\n\r\n“Marx.”\r\n\r\nNo matter what the question, the answer was Marx.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Religious Museum, once a cathedral, was directly across from\r\nthe Astoria. Each half-hour little girls, who seemed hardly more than\r\nten or twelve, their sleeves hanging down over their finger tips, with\r\ngreat dignity conducted excursions of peasants through. Their lecture\r\nstarted with the fundamental principle that the earth was round. A\r\nbas-relief of the world was underneath the huge pendulum which hung from\r\nthe dome. If you stood there long enough you saw it swing from one point\r\nto a further one. They were trying to show that it was within man’s\r\npower to make his own heaven.\r\n\r\nHere were kept the relics of the churches, the icons laden with silver\r\nand gold wrung from the poor peasants in the past. Actual concrete\r\nthings were reduced to their simplest terms on large poster-type murals\r\nwhich depicted stories, a necessary practice since the muzhiks were so\r\ngenerally illiterate. In one a kulak was coming to the priest with a\r\nsick child in his arms, asking for prayers to cure its illness. The\r\npriest, fat and clad in rich robes, shook his head, saying, “You must\r\nbring money for the saint. The saint will not cure your child unless her\r\narms are covered with silver.” But the kulak had only his farm.\r\n“Mortgage it and get the money,” the priest ordered. Soon the kulak\r\nreturned with silver, and the mural showed how now the saint’s arm was\r\nalmost hidden. But still the child remained sick. “The saint’s halo is\r\nbare,” said the priest. At last the whole figure was silvered, but the\r\nbaby died just the same.\r\n\r\nOpposite this mural was pictured the Soviet way. The father carried the\r\nbaby to the hospital, where nurses with gauze across their mouths took\r\nit preciously, bathed it carefully, laid it in bed. The entire\r\nsterilizing process was illustrated—the doctor in white gown and cap,\r\nscrubbing and washing each hand five minutes as marked by a clock.\r\nFinally you saw the child, healthy and well, jumping into its mother’s\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe people stood there looking, their imaginations fired. They said,\r\n“This is what is happening to us.”\r\n\r\nMost particularly I wanted to investigate what had been done for women\r\nand children in Russia, to learn whether they had been given the rights\r\nand liberties due them in any humanitarian civilization. Grant, Rose, as\r\nshe was known to me, and I went one day to the Institute for the\r\nProtection of Motherhood and Childhood, a vast establishment stretching\r\nover several miles, with model clinics, nurseries, milk centers, and\r\neducational laboratories. I was overwhelmed in contemplating the\r\nundertaking. There was no doubt that the Government was exerting itself\r\nstrenuously to teach the rudiments of hygiene to an enormous population\r\nthat had previously known nothing of it. Russia was also aiming to free\r\nwomen from the two bonds that enslaved them most—the nursery and the\r\nkitchen. All over the country were crèches connected with the places\r\nthey worked.\r\n\r\nChildren were the priceless possessions of Russia. Their time was\r\nplanned for them from birth to the age of sixteen, when they were paid\r\nto go to college, if they so desired. No longer were they a drain or\r\nburden to their families. Not only were teachers or parents forbidden to\r\ninflict corporal punishment, but children might even report their\r\nparents for being vindictive, ill-humored, disorderly, and in many cases\r\nthey did so.\r\n\r\nIn one divorce dispute as to custody of the offspring, the father argued\r\nthat the mother was bad. The Judge asked, “Of what does her badness\r\nconsist?”\r\n\r\n“She is nervous and loses her temper.”\r\n\r\nThe Judge agreed she was not fit for motherhood.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Russia was investing in future generations by building a\r\nhealthy race. If there were any scarcity of milk the children were\r\nsupplied first, the hospitals second, members of the Communist party\r\nthird, industrial groups fourth, professional classes fifth, and old\r\npeople over fifty had to scrape along on what they could get, unless\r\nthey were parents of Communists or closely associated with them.\r\n\r\nI was eager also to find out what had been done about the study carried\r\non by Professor Tushnov, of the Institute for Experimental Medicine, on\r\nso-called spermatoxin, a substance which, it had been rumored, produced\r\ntemporary sterility in women. I made an appointment with him, but a\r\nshock awaited me. He had tried out his spermatoxin on thirty women,\r\ntwenty-two of whom had been made immune for from four to five months,\r\nbut now all laboratory workers had been taken from pure research and set\r\nat utilitarian tasks such as the practical effects of various vocations\r\non women’s health. Nothing concerning immunization to conception could\r\nbe published in Soviet Russia, no information could be given out under\r\npenalty of arrest, and, moreover, nothing could appear in a foreign\r\npaper which had not already been printed in Russia.\r\n\r\nIntourist, the Government tourist bureau, and Voks, the All-Union\r\nSociety for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, had asked me when\r\nI had first arrived whom I wished to see and where I wished to go, and\r\nhad offered to call up people on my list and arrange for visits, a\r\nservice which had saved me much trouble and expense. In spite of this\r\nco-operative attitude, I was suspicious that much was being hidden from\r\nus. Before I had left America I had heard I could see only what Russia\r\npresented for window-dressing, and with this in mind I was on the alert.\r\n\r\nBoth Grant and I wondered how the hospitals built under the Tsars\r\ncompared with recent ones. When I asked to be taken to a certain one, I\r\nwas assured it was too far away, and anyhow it was being renovated;\r\nthere was nobody there. I said to myself, “Aha! here is one of the\r\nforbidden sights. Whoever heard of a hospital equipped to handle\r\nthousands of patients being utterly empty? They are not going to let us\r\nsee this because it might speak in favor of the old in contrast to the\r\nnew.”\r\n\r\nPolitely but firmly I insisted. Again I was told there were so many\r\nother interesting things it would be a pity to waste my time going to\r\nsee it. I found it difficult to say anything further without giving\r\noffense. Then Grant encountered a young American nurse from the\r\nPresbyterian Hospital in New York who spoke Russian; she also wanted to\r\nvisit hospitals. We engaged a car of our own and drove a good fifteen\r\nmiles out of the city over horrible roads, winding and dusty and badly\r\npaved, and even pushing on as rapidly as we could we did not get there\r\nuntil late in the afternoon. To our dismay we discovered not a patient,\r\ndoctor, or nurse in the place, only plasterers, painters, carpenters,\r\nand cleaners, pulling down and refurbishing. We had lost half a day and\r\nwere a little ashamed of our lack of faith.\r\n\r\nThe night came to take the train for Moscow. Nobody called “All aboard!”\r\nin Russia. Trains went right off underneath you when you had one foot on\r\nthe platform and one on the step. They just moved and moved fast. But we\r\nclambered on and soon the leather seats were made into our beds; they\r\nwere so slippery that we kept falling out.\r\n\r\nOnce at Moscow, we who were coming second-class, according to Marxian\r\nprocedure, received the worst rooms at the hotel; those who traveled\r\nthird had the best. I could not applaud the one selected for me. It was\r\ndirectly over the laundry, and the smells of cooking and suds floated\r\nthrough the window. I refused to stay and was accommodated on the top\r\nfloor where the servants had once lived.\r\n\r\nMoscow was as different from Leningrad as New York City from a sleepy\r\nPennsylvania town. The people walked more quickly and seemed to be going\r\nsomewhere, not simply wandering listlessly. Bedlam existed at the\r\nhotels, but by now we were beginning to learn that the Russians were so\r\nconcerned with their own efficiency that they had no time to do\r\nanything. To be in a hurry merely complicated matters. I could wait, but\r\nfor energetic Rose it was torture. To all specific requests they\r\nreplied, “It cannot be. It cannot be.” She had her own methods of coping\r\nwith this, saying she did not wish to hear the word, “impossible”; she\r\nhad no intention of asking the impossible. Then when they procrastinated\r\nwith, “a little later,” she countered, “In America we say, ‘now!’”\r\n\r\nHer triumph over dilatoriness came on Health Day. Since health was\r\nalmost a god in Russia, all activities ceased on that occasion and the\r\npopulace of Moscow came together on Red Square. The spectacle was to\r\nstart at two in the afternoon, but before it was light you could hear\r\nthe songs of men, women, and children moving towards their appointed\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nOut of our party only thirty were privileged to receive tickets, and\r\ntheir names were posted. Mrs. Clyde and I were on the list, but not\r\nGrant or Rose. The previous day the numbers were cut to twenty; that\r\nmorning there were but sixteen, and feeling ran high. “Why haven’t I a\r\nticket?”\r\n\r\nFortunately for me I had been invited to lunch by Ambassador William C.\r\nBullitt, who entertained lavishly and was helpful to traveling\r\nAmericans. When I had met him back in New England, I had never thought\r\nof him as an ambassador, nor as a man skilled in dealing with the great\r\nproblems that required strategy, diplomacy, political sagacity, and a\r\nprime knowledge of economics and history. I considered him rather as\r\namusing, an excellent dinner host, and one to whom you could go when in\r\ndifficulty, sure that he would get you out. Perhaps this was what Russia\r\nwanted at that time more than anything else. No doubt he was then\r\nsomewhat disappointed at the turn relations between Russia and the\r\nUnited States had taken. Russians on the whole admired him; they had not\r\nforgotten that, although he was not counted a proletarian or in the\r\ncategory of Jack Reed, he had lifted the cudgels for them in the early\r\ndays when friends were needed.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador’s little daughter Ann, aged ten, officiated at the head\r\nof the table, apparently enjoying herself. The house in which they were\r\nliving while the new Embassy was being built had an architecture quite\r\nbefitting what I imagined the style of Russia should be—a bit of the\r\nKremlin, a bit of a mosque, and a bit of an Indian palace.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the Square after luncheon a wave of people surged between\r\nthe rest of the diplomatic party and myself, but I kept saying\r\n“diplomatique,” and was bowed through to the grandstand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Rose had been devoting her whole attention to tickets—and\r\nthere were no tickets. The lucky holders lined up and filed off under a\r\nleader. Rose, the ever resourceful, donned a red bandanna and said to\r\nthe “forgotten men” in the party, “We’ll make our own battalion.” She\r\nhanded out slips of paper about the size of the tickets and then\r\nstarted, Grant and the Harvard professors following her through the\r\nblare of music and the tramping troops and the pageantry of blue trunks\r\nand white shirts, orange trunks and cerise shirts.\r\n\r\nWhenever anyone stopped Rose she pointed ahead and repeated my open\r\nsesame, “diplomatique,” and they let her by until she reached the last\r\nbarrier. There the guard was suspicious of her password and challenged\r\nher. Then she spied another group coming up, dashed over to the leader,\r\nand exclaimed, “Quick, please explain that our interpreter has gone on\r\nwith our tickets!”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked unbelieving, but still others arrived at that moment,\r\nand the Russian system collapsed under pressure. In they all piled, and\r\nRose turned to her unknown benefactress, “You don’t know how grateful I\r\nam to you for getting us in.”\r\n\r\nThe reply was, “You don’t know how grateful I am to you for getting us\r\nin! I’m a tourist too, and we have no tickets either.”\r\n\r\nNobody seeing Moscow that day could have thought it a somber place. It\r\nwas alive with song, happy faces, bright attire. The parade of a hundred\r\nthousand or more was one of the most marvelous spectacles for color,\r\nform, cadence, geometrical precision that I had ever seen human beings\r\naccomplish. Men and women were representing all sorts of games and\r\nsports—swimming, shooting, tennis, flying. There was nothing tawdry.\r\nEach company held aloft beautifully designed placards as it passed\r\nStalin, who stood on top of Lenin’s tomb. The Dictator looked much like\r\nhis pictures, with his heavy black mustache resembling the wings of a\r\nbird of prey.\r\n\r\nAll day long and everywhere you heard the _Internationale_, over and\r\nover and over again. Each band struck up as it approached the Tomb and\r\nkept playing as it swung on. Always the stirring song from those coming\r\nup, those far away—overtones, undertones, thrilling, insistent, now loud\r\nin your ears, now dimly echoing in the distance, a rhythmic motif\r\nsymbolizing the onward march of Young Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Chapter Thirty-six_\r\n\r\n                       FAITH IS A FINE INVENTION\r\n\r\n        “_There is a great difference between traveling to see\r\n        countries and to see people._”\r\n\r\n                                           JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tovarish —— wishes to see you,” came a call from the hotel desk. For a\r\nmoment I could not place the name, and the face had changed so\r\ncompletely that I could but faintly trace a resemblance to the boy I had\r\nseen before. He reminded me I had known him in Seattle as one who had\r\nassisted in getting up birth control meetings. When the Wobblies were\r\nbeing arrested in the United States he had hired out as a stoker on a\r\nboat, and gradually made his way to Russia, where he thought he could\r\nhelp to usher in the new society.\r\n\r\nHere was one person who had not had the best of the bargain. He was\r\nshabbily dressed and looked dilapidated, evidently having seen hard\r\ntimes, and had a beaten expression in his eyes. Yet, disillusioned as he\r\nwas, he had not come to complain. Since it was four in the afternoon,\r\nthe lunch hour in Russia, I asked him to join me in the dining room,\r\nconducted like a large commons. The waiters seemed disgruntled, unhappy,\r\ninept and knew very little about service; they glanced scornfully at the\r\nman who sat down beside me. The one lively note was the orchestra, which\r\nthrew itself into marches and wild and spirited Caucasian or Slavic folk\r\ndances while we ate.\r\n\r\nMy guest said this was the best meal he had had since leaving America.\r\n“Why don’t you come back?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t get in.”\r\n\r\n“Would you if you could?”\r\n\r\n“Just give me a chance!”\r\n\r\nI suppose it was inevitable that in such a social upheaval many\r\nsuffered. I called upon Dr. Peter Tutyshkin, who had tried to attend our\r\n1925 Conference in New York, but had arrived too late. As was the case\r\nwith most professional men of his years, he had been of the old\r\naristocracy. He and his wife and two daughters, both physicians, had\r\nowned a beautiful home. Now the thousands of volumes of what had\r\nformerly comprised his fine medical and scientific library had been\r\ntaken away, and he and his wife slept and ate in the room which had\r\ncontained them. He was margined and rationed to the last degree, and I\r\ncould feel his humiliation at having so little food that he could not\r\noffer us a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Moscow, the Eddy party and the select six whom Louis\r\nFischer was piloting, crossed our path. Fischer, a Russian living in\r\nMoscow and writing for the _Nation_, published in the United States,\r\ninvited Grant and me to go along with them to meet the Secretary of the\r\nCommissariat of Public Health, Dr. Kaminsky. We went up a wide open\r\nstairway like that of a courthouse and into a spacious room with high\r\nwindows running from floor to ceiling in French fashion and a huge\r\nbanquet table laden with the invariable afternoon tea.\r\n\r\nDr. Kaminsky addressed us. “Our worst heritage from the Old Regime was\r\nin the field of medicine. The main task before us is to unite science\r\nand practice. Our medicine is a form of social insurance, our medical\r\npolicy based on prevention. We are not interested in profit, only\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nThe Russians had been kind and had grasped very quickly any improvement\r\nsuggested to them, even accepting criticism with great tolerance. Aware\r\nof this, when Dr. Kaminsky paused for questions, Grant inquired about\r\ndoctors entering private practice.\r\n\r\n“As Russia builds up public health work,” was the answer, “more doctors\r\nwill be able to find room for private practice if they so desire.”\r\n\r\nSherwood Eddy slipped me a note. “Here’s your opportunity to bring up\r\nbirth control.”\r\n\r\nI took my cue. “Has Russia a population policy? Has she formulated any\r\nprogram for the rate of increase of her people?”\r\n\r\nThe audience stirred as though I had hurled a grenade. The interpreter\r\nleaped to his feet and shrieked, “Malthusianism! We will not have\r\nMalthusianism here! We do not need it. Do you think or imply that Soviet\r\nRussia has to advance Malthusian ideas? We can have all the children we\r\nwant and Russia can do with twice the population she now has.” He went\r\non and on.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few moments for the air to clear, I continued, “I have\r\nasked Dr. Kaminsky a simple question which I will repeat. I said nothing\r\nabout Malthusianism. But I should like to know whether Russia has a\r\npopulation policy. She has had five- and even ten-year plans for\r\nagriculture and manufacture and everything she is making. But what has\r\nshe done about the most important issue today—population, its growth and\r\ndistribution?”\r\n\r\nFischer was whispering to Dr. Kaminsky, evidently telling him what I\r\nwanted to know. The doctor replied, “If I understood correctly, you are\r\nasking if there is any policy from the biological or economic point of\r\nview.”\r\n\r\n“I am asking whether Russia, in planning her industries, has any plan\r\nalso as to the eventual control of families. I know you have much\r\nfreedom for women and a fine technique for abortions. To us that is\r\nextremely significant, because after a woman has been aborted she\r\nreturns to the same conditions and becomes pregnant again. Four hundred\r\nthousand abortions a year indicate women do not want to have so many\r\nchildren; in my opinion it is a cruel method of dealing with the problem\r\nbecause abortion, no matter how well done, is a terrific nervous strain\r\nand an exhausting physical hardship.”\r\n\r\nDr. Kaminsky’s answer was not encouraging. “There is no question as to\r\nthe increase of population. There is no policy as to the question of\r\nbiological restrictions; on the contrary there is a policy of increasing\r\nthe population. For six years we have had a great shortage, not only of\r\nskilled workers, but of labor in general.”\r\n\r\nObviously, I was not a particularly welcome visitor.\r\n\r\nBy chance I was fortunate enough to encounter again Dr. Marthe\r\nRuben-Wolf, who with her husband and children had escaped from Nazi\r\nGermany and was then at the head of a Moscow abortorium. Because of her\r\nwide experience in Germany, where clinics had been under municipal\r\nguidance, she was one of the few Communists who was sane on the subject\r\nof population. She very kindly helped me with some of my interviews.\r\n\r\nAny woman in Russia who requested it was entitled to abortion on\r\napplication to a doctor. She was told of the dangers, warned it might\r\nresult in sterility, charged about two dollars and a half. We talked to\r\nabout fifty patients who had already been there three days. None had\r\ntemperatures. They were very jolly and going home that afternoon to rest\r\nfor another week or two. Then they would go back to work with no\r\ndeduction in wages. Though some of these women had had five abortions in\r\ntwo years and one had had eight, they could not sing too highly the\r\npraises of their country for allowing the operations. When I asked\r\nwhether they would not prefer to have some information as to how to\r\navoid further ones by protecting themselves from pregnancy, each and all\r\nreplied, “We have no such thing. We hear of it, but we have nothing.\r\nRussia is too poor. We hope she will soon get it.”\r\n\r\nIn only one place did I see a clinic in the sense that we use the word\r\nhere, and that was in Moscow where Dr. Kabanova had sixty women the\r\nafternoon we viewed it. Great credit is also due Madame Lebedova who\r\norganized the original establishment of the Institutes for the\r\nProtection of Motherhood and Childhood, laid down the principles to be\r\nfollowed, and persisted until they had been embodied in a definite\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nDr. Abram B. Genss, assistant director, was in charge of contraceptive\r\nsupplies and the administration of birth control, such as it was. He was\r\nantagonistic, disagreeable, unpleasant, shouting “Malthusianism” into my\r\nears more times in one hour than I had heard it before in twenty years.\r\nThe methods in the Moscow clinic were antiquated, and I suggested\r\nsending a physician to instruct them, but my proposal was not\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nI considered Russia’s situation very serious. Her population was a\r\nmatter of mathematics; it had increased some fifty million since the\r\ndownfall of the Empire. Unless she looked ahead and educated her people\r\nin the problems which arose out of population, within two generations\r\nshe would find herself with the same differential birth rate then\r\nexisting in England and the United States. It would, however, have much\r\nmore tragic consequences since it would lower the augmentation of the\r\ncapable, skilled, shock troops of industry, the idealists and active,\r\nselfless workers, and would multiply from the bottom unskilled,\r\nignorant, dull-witted workers, the superstitious element which even the\r\ngreatest efforts of a Soviet dictatorship running at top speed could not\r\npull up and out of their evolutional environment.\r\n\r\nI really began to see Russia under another guise after we stepped on the\r\ntrain from Moscow to Gorky, the former Nizhni Novgorod. Around the big,\r\ncity hotels vendors had been trying to dispose of soft, warm sables and\r\ngold-embroidered altar pieces evidently reft from churches, asking good\r\nprices for them. But now the peasant women offered tea cozies, wooden\r\nboxes, carved and painted, dolls, leather, brass, knickknacks for the\r\ntourist, quite unlike anything obtainable elsewhere in Europe, and\r\nalways, of course, Russian blouses.\r\n\r\nThe side-wheel steamer _Kommunistka_, small but comfortable, was waiting\r\nto carry us down the Volga to Stalingrad. Our party occupied practically\r\nall available cabins, but hundreds of Russians were jammed on the decks.\r\nAt some points the river was a mile wide as it slid between flat\r\nlandscapes, limitless as far as the eye could reach. Often we overtook\r\nrafts of logs, some at least a quarter of a mile long, each bearing a\r\ndiminutive house where the captain and his family lived. You could see\r\nthe children scampering back and forth and the crew pushing it leisurely\r\ninto the current.\r\n\r\nWe were four days in transit, passing many villages and a few\r\ntowns—Kazan, Samara, and Saratov. I do not remember the cities clearly.\r\nSome places are indelible in your mind; others amount to very little. If\r\nyou are searching for something and do not find it, the scene vanishes.\r\n\r\nAt every stop men and women accompanied by children and baskets of\r\nbelongings were collected in hundreds. They had come a week or more\r\nearly to make sure of catching the boat, spending the nights on the\r\nground, subsisting on a loaf of bread, a tomato, or a cucumber. Their\r\nchildren were taken care of in the station crèche, bathed, dressed in\r\nfresh clothing, taught, directed in play, delivered to the parents just\r\nbefore the _Kommunistka_ landed.\r\n\r\nThen came the mad scramble. It was like the old days on Ellis Island\r\nwhen the peasants from Europe arrived, thousands of them, carrying huge\r\nbundles on their heads, shoving and rushing and jabbering in strange\r\ntongues, attempting to squeeze in. You wondered how so many people could\r\never get on board. They had no comforts, no room to sleep such as we.\r\nThey appeared stark and hungry, while we had marvelous food, in fact too\r\nmuch of it. Any American planning to lose weight in Russia was badly\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nStalingrad, near the mouth of the Volga, was Russia’s greatest\r\nindustrial city. Here I saw a hotel which was going up in front and\r\nfalling down behind with about equal rapidity; the building material was\r\nlying in the streets. In the one in which we lodged we had to dodge\r\nspigots. Plumbing had been laid on all over the country, but the stream\r\nfrom any tap never by any chance landed where it was intended to. You\r\napproached cautiously, not knowing whether it would get you in the eye,\r\nin the nose, or shoot over your shoulder and hit your suitcase. The\r\nbathroom had no lock, and the attendant insisted it was his job to help\r\npatrons take a bath. I pushed on one side of the door; he on the other.\r\nI won.\r\n\r\nAt Stalingrad, as everywhere I had been before, I was looking for\r\nRussian contraceptive methods, but having been discouraged both by Dr.\r\nKaminsky and Dr. Genss, I went at it rather carefully. When I visited\r\nthe impressive new hospital I asked the superintendent, who was a\r\ngynecologist and spoke good English, whether he gave contraceptive\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n“I do not, but we have a department of consultation.”\r\n\r\n“May I see it?” I had already surveyed about fifteen such, where I had\r\nfound nothing save exhibits on the wall.\r\n\r\n“It’s just across the road.”\r\n\r\n“Will you go with me?” I asked. “Elsewhere it’s been hard to get\r\ninformation.”\r\n\r\nHe agreed readily. As we entered, an attendant was displaying lengthy\r\ndiagrams to some tourists being shepherded through, and telling them\r\nbirth control was taught in hospitals throughout Russia. Someone I knew\r\ncame up to me. “This is wonderful, Mrs. Sanger, the people are being\r\ntaught birth control by the Government.”\r\n\r\nThe posters were there to prove this, but the consultation room itself\r\nwas locked. “Who is in charge here?” demanded the superintendent. “I’ve\r\nbeen sending patients over. Who takes care of them?”\r\n\r\n“I do sometimes,” a woman assistant volunteered. She let us into the\r\nroom. There were the same cases I had seen everywhere, probably\r\nuntouched since 1925, the articles within moldy and cracked.\r\n\r\n“What do you use?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We have nothing. We’ve asked and asked Moscow, but we get nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe superintendent was much embarrassed; he inquired how long it had\r\nbeen since supplies had come.\r\n\r\n“Two years.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“We don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what about the patients I send over here?”\r\n\r\n“We just tell them to go home and wait. We have nothing for them.”\r\n\r\nFrom Stalingrad we took the train to Ordzonikidze, the beginning of the\r\nGeorgian Military Highway through the Caucasus to Tiflis. After the\r\nusual breakfast of Russian tea, black bread, and fresh caviar, which I\r\nfound delicious, we climbed into four open-topped char-à-bancs, filling\r\nthem to capacity. Enormous trucks came behind with our luggage. For\r\nabout two hours we rolled along by the side of the river Terek, which\r\nwas running dark and going so fast that the only thing I could think of\r\nwas the streams from Swiss glaciers, but instead of being ice-green,\r\nthis was muddy, splashing up on the road. The guides told us there had\r\nbeen a two-day, torrential rain, the worst the Caucasus had ever known.\r\n\r\nAbout ten we stopped to stretch our legs at a village. Groups of lusty\r\nmountaineers stared at us, grinning good-humoredly as though we were as\r\nodd as any freaks in a circus. They gave us cheese and bread; some of us\r\nbought wine and tea, not knowing when we might leave. After three hours\r\nwe were still at the village when finally men with great high hats and\r\nmilitary-looking, astrakhan capes rode up on horseback and spoke to our\r\nguides who, not being Georgian, had difficulty divining they were trying\r\nto say our cars could not pass.\r\n\r\nWe thought it was just like the Russians to fuss about a few little\r\nobstacles, and said there must be some way to get through. Off we went,\r\nand our drivers were magnificent. With the stubbornness of tractors we\r\nplunged across streams and over rocks; when trees blocked the road, they\r\nlifted the trunks, branches and all. We drove on and on, slowly, and at\r\nlast, towards five o’clock, came to a spot where there was nothing\r\nbefore us—nothing but the mountain side sheer to the swirling water.\r\n\r\nOut clambered the eighty tourists, youthful and aged, tall and short,\r\nthin and fat. We could see the road begin about a quarter of a mile\r\nbeyond, a sultry sun smiling on the peaks of the mountains. The river\r\nwas still rising. One of our guides waded in to test whether we could\r\nford it, and was soon practically up to his middle in the turbid flood.\r\nGrant began ferrying old ladies over the deep places and a couple of\r\nboys carried the two-hundred-and-ten-pound Professor Ross. The current\r\nwas terrific, and people kept falling.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly three hours everybody was across. Our leader found a horse,\r\ngalloped off to secure new buses, which arrived and took us to the town\r\nwhere we were supposed to have lunch. But it was now dark and lunch\r\nbecame supper. More conversations, more consultations, more delay, more\r\nmystery. Why did we not start? The answer was that three strange men\r\nwere sitting in one of our cars—Russians who wanted to get to Tiflis.\r\nThey were going to have their rights. When pleading, arguing, reasoning\r\ncould not move them, the G.P.U. had to be invoked; still no results. Not\r\nuntil they had been promised that a bus would leave immediately did they\r\ndescend and make room for the three of our group whose seats they had\r\nusurped.\r\n\r\nWe rattled off again, only to be turned back. Another long halt and more\r\nconversation. Ultimately, since buses had been dispatched from Tiflis to\r\nmeet us and were waiting about six miles away, it was decided to push\r\non.\r\n\r\nThen began the real drive through Godaur Pass, up and over rocks and\r\nembankments, roots of trees, sand and water, precarious detours in a\r\nnight as jet as any I have ever seen. The militia had been ordered by\r\nMoscow to keep the route open—green skyrockets for us to come ahead, red\r\nones to stop, and swinging lanterns in front of the worst danger\r\nspots—great drops down into ravines. At last we reached the end and\r\nmounted a new set of buses, but only three of them. Grant was among\r\nthose who stayed behind. We arrived at Tiflis at two in the morning.\r\nDinner was ready as well as clean beds, and we slept until the humid sun\r\nstirred us out for breakfast, just as the rest came straggling in.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday morning. Lining the steps of the old Georgian cathedral\r\nwere beggar women—lame, blind, filthy—never had I seen any others in\r\nRussia. Children were curiously looking on at the Mass, but we were told\r\nparents were forbidden to make them go to church. The few elderly women\r\nattending were carrying flowers and had twined them also around the\r\nframes of the saints’ pictures. We tourists presented an incongruous\r\ncontrast to the priests with their long beards and splendid robes.\r\n\r\nTiflis had slipped the yoke of Moscow. Here among the mosques and the\r\ncamels and the bazaars, which gave it a definitely Oriental tinge, we\r\nfinally saw signs of private enterprise. Back in the mountains were\r\ntribes the Soviet was trying to civilize—warlike, uncultured, barbaric.\r\nStalin, sentimental for the country of his origin perhaps, was choosing\r\nas many Georgians as he could for high places and sending in teachers\r\nand moving pictures to educate the others, but the task was herculean.\r\n\r\nIt was hot, torrid noon when we arrived at Batum on the Black Sea. The\r\nsun was pouring down; we wanted to go swimming to cool off, and were\r\ndirected to a stony beach. The water was darkened by the heavy, rich\r\ndeposit which coated the bottom, and the sand, of the same color, was\r\nstrewn with masses of people just like Coney Island, thousands of them\r\non the seaweed-covered rocks. It did not look pleasant and we walked\r\nfurther. A partition of slats through which there was perfect visibility\r\nwas supposed to divide the women from the men, but despite having heard\r\nso much about the nude bathing there, we discovered everyone had on\r\nsuits—astounding, old-fashioned garments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clyde declined to go in, but sat watching in her hat and glasses.\r\nTanya kept on pink panties and a brassiere. The rest of us determined to\r\nthrow off our inhibitions. Once you did this you were freed from them\r\nfor the time being; it was the doing that was so hard. Most surprising\r\nwere the New England schoolteachers, who had certainly never before\r\nremoved their clothes in public. They dashed their long, lean bodies\r\nboldly into the water as though to say, “Russia, here we come!”\r\n\r\nThe steamer on which we left Batum was dirty, loaded with passengers who\r\nhad to be stepped over as they slept on deck. If you left your stateroom\r\neven a few moments somebody grabbed it and took your bed.\r\n\r\nBut the scenery of the Russian Riviera was very lovely. The spurs of the\r\nCaucasus along the coast glittered with marble palaces. I shall always\r\nremember the mighty, sable cypress trees, slender columns silhouetted\r\nagainst the creamy white walls; they were not funereal to me, but more\r\nlike sentinels.\r\n\r\nOnly the chosen of the chosen, the executives and the intelligentsia,\r\ncould stay at Yalta for holidays. Many individuals, Agnes Smedley, for\r\none, had reason to be grateful to the Soviet for their rest periods.\r\nAlthough not a Communist she had written sympathetic articles, and the\r\nRussian Health Department, hearing she was ill in China, had sent her an\r\ninvitation to come and recuperate, and here she had stayed a year\r\nwithout cost, recovering from a strained heart.\r\n\r\nI spent a day in the majestic Byzantine summer palace of Nicholas II at\r\nnear-by Livadia. It was perfectly landscaped with statues, fountains,\r\nterraces. As we drove up multitudinous shaved heads popped out open\r\nwindows. In the marvelous ballroom were a hundred and fifty enamel cots,\r\nside by side, the sleeping quarters of the men on vacation. We saw the\r\nroom belonging to the former Tsarina, with fragile, brocaded walls and\r\ndelicate panels. In the center of the parquet floor, bare of any\r\ncovering, stood a deal table with checked gingham cloth.\r\n\r\nNow and then you caught a glimpse of people in the palace, but mostly\r\nthey were reclining in the gardens. As we wandered round and round we\r\ncame upon a cluster of twenty-five asleep, pale, and not too well-fed.\r\nThey did not twitch an eyelid as we approached. I asked Tanya, “Who are\r\nthese?”\r\n\r\nTouching one of them on the shoulder, she said, “Tovarish, these\r\ntovarishes want to know who you are.”\r\n\r\nAt that not only he but all of them jumped to their feet, as though at\r\nmilitary drill. One after the other gave his name, each with a “vich” or\r\na “ski” on the end of it, stating also his occupation. As he finished he\r\nturned his head to the next, who took up the recital. The little woman\r\nwith bobbed black hair and a curious bodice of blue proudly said she\r\nwore the Cross of Lenin on her dress because with him she had fought for\r\nRussia. This was the highest honor any woman in Russia could be paid;\r\nonly a hundred had it.\r\n\r\nThen the first man bowed politely to Tanya and with dignity said\r\nsomething to her. She interpreted to us, “They want to know who _you_\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“Tell them we’re Americans.”\r\n\r\n“North Americans?” with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThen question after question spattered like a machine gun. “Are you from\r\nSeattle? Portland? How did you get here? What way did you come? How long\r\ndid it take you? How much did it cost? What has happened to Dillinger?\r\nWhat’s the latest news of the seamen’s strike on the Pacific Coast? How\r\nsoon comes the Revolution?”\r\n\r\nWe were rather dazed at the degree of current information they had\r\ngleaned—chiefly from posters in the parks. Their bombardment continued.\r\n“Do women in America have as much freedom as men?” We all disagreed on\r\nthat. “Can married women work for the Government? Can they teach\r\nschool?” Some of us answered “No,” others, “Yes.” On every inquiry of\r\ntheirs we were divided, but on whatever we asked them they were united.\r\n\r\n“Who is your favorite American author?”\r\n\r\nI answered, “I like Sinclair Lewis.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at me accusingly, “Not Theodore Dreiser?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” I agreed, “he’s good.”\r\n\r\nA man suggested, “Not Upton Sinclair?”\r\n\r\nThey were apparently sadly disappointed in us.\r\n\r\nAt last one of them, making a sweeping gesture, said to me, “Your\r\nAmerican Government has never built anything like this for its workers,\r\nhas it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied, “we never had a Tsar,” which was very tactless of me.\r\n\r\nHe answered something to the effect, “You people have opinions but no\r\nconvictions. We have been to prison for ours.”\r\n\r\nTanya volunteered, pointing to me, “This lady has been to prison eight\r\ntimes for hers.”\r\n\r\nAstonishment was registered, and one man spoke hurriedly to Tanya who\r\ntranslated, “He wants to know who you are. Shall I tell him?” She then\r\nexplained I was advocating birth control.\r\n\r\n“Well, we have that. Haven’t you visited any of our hospitals? Thousands\r\nof women have it.”\r\n\r\n“No, that’s abortion. We don’t want that. Birth control is different.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation had shifted to something concrete and real; we had\r\nstruck up an _entente_ that was very _cordiale_. The group gathered\r\ncloser. “Come on. Come on. This is important.” They had never heard of\r\ncontraception. How could anyone have put me in jail for that? What a\r\ncrazy government! Worse than they had thought!\r\n\r\nThe woman said, “We need you over here. Come and work with us. Don’t\r\nwaste your life in America.”\r\n\r\nFrom the impatient bus came horns, whistles, bells, summoning us away.\r\nThe whole twenty-five followed us to the char-à-bancs, waving farewell.\r\n\r\nTanya was a most discerning little person, ordinarily impassive but\r\nspringing up animatedly the moment music started. One of our party\r\ninvited her, “Come on to America. You’ll have pretty clothes, and for\r\nanyone who can dance like you, fame is waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Pretty clothes? I have two dresses, which answer their purpose. And as\r\nfor fame—this is my people. I enjoy dancing, and they enjoy me. Why\r\nshould I go to America?”\r\n\r\nBefore I left I wanted to do something for her, give her some sort of\r\ngift in return for her many services. She was going to be married and,\r\nbecause her mother was old-fashioned, have a registered ceremony, call\r\nin all her friends, and even don special raiment. I had some new\r\nstockings with me and presented them to her. She looked at them, handled\r\nthem as though treasuring some lovely thing she longed for but could not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t dare wear them. I would be ashamed because my friends could\r\nnot have the same.”\r\n\r\nTanya was willing to go without until silk stockings were to be had by\r\nall. It was necessary to grasp this attitude to understand Sovietism. It\r\ngave you slight personal freedom, and you had to ask yourself honestly\r\nwhether exploitation by government or by individual was basically\r\ndifferent. But what you did have was security for your old age and the\r\nhope that when the rewards came you would have your share.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were a mass of contradictions. One moment I was irritated\r\nenough to tear them limb from limb, the next prostrate before their\r\nsincerity and zeal. The more than one hundred and fifty races and\r\nforty-five languages made for problems that challenged man’s\r\nintelligence. Perhaps no other nation had had a lower order of serfdom\r\nto arouse from lethargy and put to work on a new civilization. Nothing\r\nbut admiration could be accorded their attempts and achievements.\r\n\r\nBut most of the time they were entranced by their own drug of idealism.\r\nThey had swallowed so much of it that they were self-hypnotized, and\r\nbumped into reality without understanding it. Like the Spanish, it was\r\nenough for them to say, “It will be,” without taking sufficient thought\r\nas to how to bring it about.\r\n\r\nAt Odessa we boarded what then seemed to us by contrast the most\r\nbeautiful ship in the world, the Italian liner _Campidoglio_, entering\r\ninto another domain. A neat, white cloth was spread for you, yourself;\r\nno longer did you have a soiled napkin folded for indefinite use;\r\nspotless coats adorned the waiters; our chairs were pulled out;\r\neverybody had a proper bed and cabin. It was only a simple ship, but it\r\nsignified Western refinement, and I must say I welcomed it. No matter\r\nhow much proletarian sympathy you might have, you appreciated clean\r\ntables, dishes, sheets, towels, and a bathroom that worked.\r\n\r\nIn order to hurry back to school Grant separated from me in Rumania and\r\nmy husband joined me in Naples to go to Marienbad. I had barely reached\r\nthere when Grant cabled that Stuart was ill again; I left for home the\r\nsame day. On arrival I found the doctors contemplating a radical\r\noperation, but I refused to let him have another. As an alternative\r\nTucson, Arizona, was suggested for its dry, warm climate. His wound was\r\nstill unhealed when we started.\r\n\r\nBeing stowed away in Stuart’s small Ford coupé for days on end gave us\r\nthe best possible opportunity to catch up in our talks and experiences\r\nand place trivial and unimportant events in the pockets of memory where\r\nthey belonged. The joy of thus familiarizing myself with my grown-up son\r\nmade me envy mothers who had leisure to grow along with their children\r\nor, at least, to watch them develop. But it is possible we are all the\r\nbetter friends in adult life; at least we adhere to the rights of\r\nindividuality for ourselves and for each other.\r\n\r\nIt was nearing the close of October when one bright morning we left El\r\nPaso and came across miles and miles of brown and yellow desert, up to\r\nthe hills and mountains. Through the heat waves we saw mirages; we were\r\npositive they were lakes. Arizona was so unlike any place I had been\r\nbefore; you either had to be enthralled by it or hate and dread it. Not\r\nbeing quick to come to conclusions I was not at first sure. But I knew\r\nthere was a delight in the cool nights and the translucent, sunny days\r\nwith a lovely tang in the air. In the beginning it was the people who\r\nwon me, particularly Mrs. Robert P. Bass, daughter of Mrs. Charles\r\nSumner Bird, one of our early pioneers. We stayed with her for a short\r\ntime, and then took a pink adobe house out where the desert met the\r\nfoothills. Stuart grew better. In the spring we packed our bags once\r\nmore in the little car and drove away, looking back regretfully at the\r\nindescribable Catalinas, on which light and clouds played in\r\nnever-ending change of pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-seven_\r\n\r\n                    WHO CAN TAKE A DREAM FOR TRUTH?\r\n\r\n        “_Divinity sleeps in stones, breathes in plants, dreams\r\n        in animals, and awakes in human beings._”\r\n\r\n                                                  INDIAN PROVERB\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral times I had approached the idea of going to India, and always\r\nsomething had prevented me. In 1922 when I was near by, it was the hot\r\nseason and everybody had gone to the hill stations. In 1928, when I had\r\nalso made tentative plans, I was not well. I think I had, in addition,\r\nbeen reluctant because Katherine Mayo’s book had left me with such an\r\naching pain I felt powerless to help lift the inertia she described.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1936, I had word from Margaret Cousins, pioneer in the\r\nIndian women’s movement, wife of a poet and university professor, who\r\nasked whether I would accept an invitation to attend the coming\r\nAll-India Women’s Conference. The previous conference had passed a\r\nresolution favoring birth control in theory, but now they wanted me to\r\nassist them to “put teeth in it,” to draw up one which would outline a\r\npractical plan applicable to all castes, to present it, and to argue for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSince such a resolution would mean that the movement had now gone beyond\r\nthe point where we had to break in to be heard, and would start things\r\nin the right direction, I arranged to spend three months in India, from\r\nNovember to January, under the auspices of the International Information\r\nCenter, which had been set up in London after the Geneva Conference so\r\nthat various peoples and countries interested in the subject might have\r\nsome means of contact.\r\n\r\nMrs. John Phillips, who had fought many battles in Pittsburgh for birth\r\ncontrol, suggested that her daughter, a graduate of Vassar and a\r\nnewspaper woman, might come along as my secretary. All the way a fine\r\nyoung crowd rallied around the lively Anna Jane, who had as great a\r\ncapacity for laughter as any human being I ever knew. Nothing was too\r\nhard for her, nothing too big or too small for her to do; altogether she\r\nwas a perfect companion, beginning with our voyage to England, and\r\nending in Honolulu.\r\n\r\nTemporarily in London was Gandhi’s appointed successor, Pundit\r\nJawaharlal Nehru, of a family noted for scholarship. He was the youthful\r\nleader of the more radical elements in India, much more inclined towards\r\nCommunism than Gandhi. After having been in jail for four years he had\r\nnow been released to see his wife who was ill and dying in Germany. I\r\nwas unable to be present at a reception for him, so Anna Jane telephoned\r\nto say I was sorry. “Why should Mrs. Sanger be sorry?” he said, with the\r\nsimplicity of the truly great. “She can come any time.” I did so the\r\nnext afternoon.\r\n\r\nNehru was quiet and poised, with a thoughtful manner which impressed you\r\nimmediately as one of controlled intelligence. His intention was to\r\nestablish in the mind of Young India that Gandhi’s spiritual doctrines\r\nwould only be effective if knit with economic and sociological\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nMore recondite than the Indian was the Englishman, Paul Brunton, small\r\nand dark, with a solemn, intense, almost mystic expression in his eyes.\r\nHe was attempting to find what virtue lay in fakirs and holy men,\r\ncombing India for them, and had embodied the result in his book, _The\r\nSearch in Secret India_. He told me, “Not many holy men remain; most of\r\nthem have gone back into the mountains, inaccessible to Westerners. The\r\none for whom I have the greatest regard is the sage of Arunachala, the\r\nMaharshi of Tiruvannamalai. My wife and I have a little hut southwest of\r\nMadras, and if you will visit us when you reach that section of India, I\r\nwill see that you come into his presence.”\r\n\r\nNaturally I accepted his offer eagerly and put it on my “must” list.\r\n\r\nShortly before my departure from London, a farewell banquet was given at\r\nthe Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, a relic of old London known to few, and to\r\nwhich you could be admitted only by invitation. It was on Monkwell\r\nStreet in the City near the London Wall and Aldersgate. Well aware of\r\nthe difficulties of threading that maze, even by daylight, I inquired of\r\nthe carriage attendant at the Savoy whether the taxi-driver were\r\nfamiliar with it.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Madam.”\r\n\r\nOff I went with Mrs. Kerr-Lawson, the painter’s wife, somewhat pressed\r\nfor time. As usual in November, it was raining. After we had serpentined\r\nin and out for twenty minutes we began to surmise that the driver was\r\nlost, and I called to him, “Don’t you know the way?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I thought it was down ’ere, but it don’t seem to be.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you ask somebody?”\r\n\r\n“W’ere’s Barbers’ ’All?” He addressed a mail carrier, who paused to\r\nthink, and then said, “Well, it’s along there,” pointing back from where\r\nwe had come.\r\n\r\nWe turned about but had no better luck. The driver stopped at least ten\r\npeople, each in uniform or livery of some kind or other, “W’ere’s\r\nBarbers’ ’All?” and all we heard was the echo, “Barbers’ ’All?” He drew\r\nup beside a bobby; even he did not know.\r\n\r\nFinally, we saw smart-looking cars going in a certain direction. We said\r\nthat must be it, and, sure enough, there on the corner was the sign. For\r\nour own peace of mind we were not last. H.G. was close behind us,\r\nfrothing with fury because he too had been driving around Robin Hood’s\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\nMuch of the building was locked up, but what we saw was beautifully\r\npreserved. Evidently the Guild of the Barbers had prospered in the days\r\nwhen their members did bleeding and leeching, and attended to other\r\nannoyances of humanity, such as pulling teeth.\r\n\r\nThe dining room, once the operating theater, was now the fairest setting\r\nfor a dinner that one could have—the service presented by Queen Anne,\r\ncrystal goblets, a silver rose-carved finger bowl, the vast Royal Grace\r\nCup given by Henry VIII, like a chalice with a six-inch stem, everything\r\nused only on rare occasions. The table was like an E with the middle\r\nleft out, and in the center sat Harry Guy in his high-backed chair above\r\nthe rest of us. I was on his right and next me was a man whose name had\r\nperformed almost a miracle for birth control in England—Baron Thomas\r\nHorder, then physician to the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nSidney Walton, the member without whom this banquet could not have taken\r\nplace, opened the affair as ancient custom prescribed by declaiming,\r\n“Pray, silence for the King!” After the toast to His Majesty, one was\r\ndrunk to the President of the United States, and then my health was\r\nproposed; the loving cup, containing about a quart of red wine, began to\r\nmake the rounds. During the toast, three people had to be standing—the\r\none holding the cup, the one who just had it on the left, and the one on\r\nthe right who was to receive it. The waiter came to wipe the lip\r\nhygienically when each had swallowed his sip; this was the sole modern\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nLondon offered me many courtesies. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia was\r\nnow in full swing. Rumors were abroad that British ships were avoiding\r\nthe Suez Canal; therefore, I booked on a Dutch line. When I mentioned\r\nthis to Sir John Megaw, former director of the Indian Medical Service,\r\nhe practically stopped breathing and bristled in every hair of his head.\r\n“What! a P. and O. boat not go through the Canal for fear of Italy?”\r\n\r\n“So I’ve heard.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mrs. Sanger, you can go through the Suez Canal on a British\r\nboat if the British Navy has to escort you through!”\r\n\r\nSir John’s report calling upon the British Government to make some plan\r\nfor population growth, increase, and distribution for India was one of\r\nthe most intelligent issued by any health officer in this age. Although\r\nentirely in sympathy with my project, yet he doubted whether it would be\r\npossible for me to do anything. That I was an American, however, he\r\nthought might obviate the antagonism which would inevitably follow the\r\nmention of birth control by anybody from the British Isles.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the _Viceroy of India_ sailed, we seemed much nearer\r\nthe East. Indian deck hands moved about, distinguishable by their slim\r\nbodies, brown faces, and turbans, but the English were in command of all\r\ndepartments. It must have been a source of resentment to the Indian\r\npassengers to be ignored or treated as inferiors by the English Civil\r\nService going to rule them in their own land.\r\n\r\nThe ship was second-rate, rocky in a heavy sea, and raucous. The blast\r\nof bugles for rising and meals had long since been outmoded on most\r\npassenger liners but was retained here. I was awakened at eight or\r\nearlier every morning by the most awful thud, thud, thud overhead. After\r\nI had had a headache for two days I went up to the sports deck and found\r\nthe English were getting exercise by throwing quoits around directly\r\nabove my stateroom.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal was bright with yellow sand and blue sky. We slowly\r\nsteamed past two Italian transports with bandaged soldiers on the decks,\r\ninvalided home from Ethiopia. As far as conversation on our own vessel\r\nwent, no one would have suspected there was a war. Not an Englishman\r\nbrought up the subject, and, if drawn into a discussion, he eluded it by\r\nsaying his country could jolly well look after itself.\r\n\r\nOnce we were in the Red Sea, passengers and officers emerged in white;\r\nthe decks were roofed with canvas so that the games might go on. Most of\r\nthese British had traveled so much they had a seafaring routine. They\r\nindulged in sports in the morning, dressed appropriately. From two to\r\nfour in the afternoon a pall of silence descended. All the chairs on the\r\ndeck were occupied by dozing, browsing loungers. But as soon as the tea\r\nthings appeared, life began to be interesting. Music burst forth from\r\nthe orchestra, babies were brought up from the nursery, everybody\r\nhurried to and fro from chair to table, picking and choosing cakes or\r\nbuns, sandwiches or plain bread and jam. After dinner again the full,\r\nblazing lights gave ample illumination for the interminable deck tennis\r\nand quoits.\r\n\r\nBombay from the distance was a city of tall buildings. Not until very\r\nclose could you see the sizzling heat on the water; the hot sun and\r\nheavy air made it unpleasant to stand on deck. The wharf was filled, the\r\nBritish easily recognizable by their sola topees, the ugliest headgear\r\nin the world. All were waving with great excitement, and many carried\r\nflower garlands for visitors or those coming home. Amid scrambling and\r\nconfusion coolies swarmed aboard for luggage. A delegation of about\r\nfifty welcomed us, including Edith How-Martyn, who had been sounding out\r\npopular and religious sentiment, and Dr. A. P. Pillay, editor of the\r\nmagazine, _Marriage Hygiene_, the man most active in eugenics and birth\r\ncontrol in India.\r\n\r\nI had written to Gandhi and a reply from him greeted me at the boat, “Do\r\nby all means come whenever you can, and you shall stay with me, if you\r\nwould not mind what must appear to you to be our extreme simplicity; we\r\nhave no masters and no servants here.”\r\n\r\nThe evening was hot and oppressive indoors but mild and balmy outside,\r\nand I sauntered under a lovely, deep sky. The women, small of body,\r\nankles, and wrists, with well-formed features, and softly spoken as the\r\nJapanese, whether poor or not, wore bracelets, anklets, rings in the\r\nears, and some a button jewel in the side of the nose. Seldom were any\r\nin Western costume; almost always they wore saris, graceful folds draped\r\nover their heads. Men and boys were stretched out on the walks, their\r\nonly belongings the mats on which they lay. It was revolting to see\r\nsomething stir in the dust, and watch rags change into a human being\r\nsleeping there.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon I had my first meeting in Cowasji Jehangir Hall, the\r\nlargest in Bombay, and clamorously noisy. It was open to the street, and\r\ntrams went wobbling by, pedestrians talked loudly, and dozens and dozens\r\nof electric fans purred round and round and round. You had to speak at\r\nthe very top of your throat in order to be heard; Indians were\r\naccustomed to the British enunciation and the British pitch and found\r\nAmerican English difficult to understand. Looking down on the audience\r\nwas like gazing at a choppy sea; it was a broken mass of Gandhi white\r\ncaps, shaped rather like those worn by our soldiers overseas. They were\r\nnot removed in the house, in shops, or even at table. Everywhere in\r\nIndia you saw them, showing how large was his following.\r\n\r\nI had been told that unmarried women did not exist in India and none of\r\nthe cultured class worked for wages. However, the very day I landed I\r\nmet three girls who were still single, gave their time to help the\r\noutcasts, and had small apartments of their own. Two of them were trying\r\nto be independent; another received an allowance from her father who,\r\nthough disapproving, supplied her livelihood.\r\n\r\nIt had been predicted also that only Eurasians and the lower classes\r\nwould listen to me on birth control, but the question turned out to be\r\nnot, “Shall it be given?” but “What to give?” and it came from all\r\nstrata. The Mayor of Bombay invited me to address a gathering of city\r\nofficials. Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, the famous poetess, outstanding for her\r\nloyalty to India and next to Gandhi the most beloved person in the\r\ncountry, talked with me about holding a meeting in Hyderabad, where her\r\nhusband was head of the medical profession. Lady Braybourne during\r\nluncheon at Government House told me that she and the Governor were\r\nanxious to prevent the fifteen hundred people on their own compound from\r\ndoubling their numbers within a few years. What would I suggest?\r\n\r\nThe answer was complicated by many factors. First and foremost was the\r\nunspeakable poverty which prevailed. A contraceptive so cheap that it\r\ncould be available to everyone had been invented in the form of a foam\r\npowder which could be made from rice starch; enough for a year should\r\nnot cost more than ten cents. But as yet we had not tested it\r\nsufficiently to guarantee its harmlessness and efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe poorer women of Bombay, sober-faced and dull-looking, who\r\nparticularly needed this method, lived in the grubby and deadly\r\n_chawls_—huts of corrugated iron—no windows, no lights, no lamps, just\r\nthree walls and sometimes old pieces of rag or paper hung up in front in\r\na pitiful attempt at privacy.\r\n\r\nI soon learned that when traveling through the country we had to have a\r\nservant, or bearer, to secure railroad compartments, make up the beds,\r\nsee we had food at various stations, and keep the vendors off.\r\nMattresses, blankets, sheets, pillows, towels, and soap had to accompany\r\nus on trains. From Cook’s we acquired Joseph, an extraordinary\r\ncharacter, dressed always in a black alpaca coat and colorful turban. We\r\npaid him about a dollar a day, considered a very good salary. However,\r\nsince he spoke not only Hindustani, but also Bengali, Tamil, and\r\nEnglish, we thought him an excellent find. He waited on us, brought us\r\ntea in the morning, went with us on calls.\r\n\r\nJoseph’s respect for us was enormously increased when he heard we were\r\ngoing to visit Gandhi. He became our devoted adviser, sleeping outside\r\nthe door at night. Because of his position it was beneath his dignity to\r\ncarry anything. Consequently we were obliged to hire a coolie for his\r\nluggage as well as several for our own. India was undoubtedly the place\r\nfor the white man to lose his inferiority complex, should he have one;\r\nthe serving class was obsequious, and the educated, aloof and superior.\r\n\r\nWe were met at the station at Wardha by a covered, two-wheeled cart, a\r\ntonga, very clean with little steps leading up and drawn by a\r\ncream-colored bullock. Since there were no seats, we sat flat on the\r\nbottom and were pulled leisurely and slowly along dusty roads to the\r\n_ashram_.\r\n\r\nGandhi was cross-legged on the floor of a room in a large squarish\r\nstructure, a white cloth like a sheet around him. He rose to greet me as\r\nI entered with an armful of books and flowers and magazines and gloves\r\nthat I had not realized were there until we tried to take each other by\r\nboth hands. He beamed and I laughed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more exaggerated than his pictures was Gandhi’s appearance:\r\nhis ears stuck out more prominently; his shaved head was more shaved;\r\nhis toothless mouth grinned more broadly, leaving a great void between\r\nhis lips. But around him and a part of him was a luminous aura. And once\r\nyou had seen this, the ugliness faded and you glimpsed the something in\r\nthe essence of his being which people have followed and which has made\r\nthem call him the Mahatma.\r\n\r\nThis was Monday, Gandhi’s day of silence, of meditation and prayer. He\r\nwas so besieged by problems and difficulties on which he had to decide\r\nthat this one twenty-four hours he reserved for himself without\r\ninterruption. Therefore, he merely smiled and nodded his head and then\r\nAnna Jane and I were escorted along a gravel path to the guest house,\r\nperhaps a hundred yards away, a building of four rooms, rough-hewn,\r\nwhite-plastered walls, the upper section open for ventilation. On the\r\nuneven stone floor stood two mattress-less cots on which our bedding was\r\nspread. A roof pole in the center had a circular shelf which served as\r\ntable or chairs according to need.\r\n\r\nBowls of porridge and milk were brought, sweetened with either honey or\r\nburned sugar—I could not tell which, but it was very pleasant. I asked\r\nno questions about its being boiled, or whether it was goats’ or cows’\r\nmilk; although I happened not to be hungry, down it went just the same.\r\n\r\nFrom tiffin on we inspected the cotton-growing, the paper-making, the\r\noil press, and the irrigation by means of old-fashioned turn wheels. I\r\nwas not enthusiastic. It seemed so pitiable an effort, like going\r\nbackward instead of forward, and trying to keep millions laboring on\r\npetty hand processes merely in order to give them work to do by which\r\nthey might exist.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Gandhi wrote on his slate that next morning I could join\r\nhim in his walk. This was his regular exercise, occupying about an hour.\r\nHe took quite good care of himself physically, observing rules of health\r\nand diet rigidly and strictly. He had to in order to perform the\r\ntremendous quantity of labor always facing him.\r\n\r\nAfter we had ascended to the roof for evening prayers, our cots were\r\nmoved out on the terrace under the moon and stars and the glorious,\r\nlimitless sky overhead. Lights shimmered along the path to the main\r\nhouse but, for the rest, all was darkness. I never was more conscious of\r\nnature’s stillness or of more constant stirrings from human beings—the\r\nechoing chant from the village near by, singing, calling, laughing, dogs\r\nbarking, the sounds wafted clearly through the cool and crisp air while\r\nnot a leaf on the trees trembled. At four the bells rang out for morning\r\nprayers and at six Joseph came to tell me the hour and I arose and\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nGandhi and I walked with his other two women guests; they deemed sacred\r\nevery moment they spent with him. Men, women, and children waited for\r\nhim as he passed, several prostrating themselves as to a holy person.\r\nStepping over the debris we traversed narrow byways through the open\r\nfields where families huddled in their tiny huts together with dogs and\r\ngoats. People were bathing and washing and cleaning their teeth. Little\r\nspirals of smoke were drifting from the fires for the morning meal.\r\n\r\nAt eleven we all went to our breakfast across the court, leaving our\r\nshoes outside. Everybody was ready, and great shining trays of\r\nsilver-looking metal were placed before us on the floor. Gandhi was\r\ntrying to persuade the Indians to utilize native-grown vegetables in\r\ndifferent ways and thus increase their vitamin consumption. Mrs. Gandhi\r\nsupervised the culinary department, and herself served the meal, of\r\nwhich there was a goodly and varied supply—no meat, but plenty of fruits\r\nand vegetables in curious combinations, such as tomatoes and oranges in\r\na salad. All picked up their food with their fingers, mixing it and\r\nscooping it in very cleverly without dropping a morsel.\r\n\r\nSo numerous were Gandhi’s adherents, so deep his influence, that I was\r\nsure his endorsement of birth control would be of tremendous value if I\r\ncould convince him how necessary it was for Indian women. After\r\nbreakfast I set myself to the task.\r\n\r\nHe spoke fluent English in a low voice with accurate intonations, never\r\nlacking for a word, and could apparently discuss any subject near or\r\nfar. Nevertheless, I felt his registering of impressions was blunted;\r\nwhile you were answering a question of his, he held to an idea or a\r\ntrain of thought of his own, and, as soon as you stopped, continued it\r\nas though he had not heard you. Time and again I believed he was going\r\nalong with me, and then came the stone wall of religion or emotion or\r\nexperience, and I could not dynamite him over this obstacle. In fact,\r\ndespite his claim to open-mindedness, he was proud of not altering his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nGandhi maintained that he knew women and was in sympathetic accord with\r\nthem. Personally, after listening to him for a while, I did not believe\r\nhe had the faintest glimmering of the inner workings of a woman’s heart\r\nor mind. He accused himself of being a brute by having desired his wife\r\nwhen he was younger, and classed all sex relations as debasing acts,\r\nalthough sometimes necessary for procreation. He agreed that no more\r\nthan three or four children should be born to a family, but insisted\r\nthat intercourse, therefore, should be restricted for the entire married\r\nlife of the couple to three or four occasions.\r\n\r\nI suggested that such a regimen was bound to cause psychological\r\ndisturbances in both husband and wife. Furthermore, when respect and\r\nconsideration and reverence were a part of the relationship I called it\r\nlove, not lust, even if it found expression in sex union, with or\r\nwithout children.\r\n\r\nGandhi referred me to nature, the great director, who would solve our\r\nproblems if we depended on her, but said what we were doing was to\r\ninject man’s ideas into nature.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied, “How can you differentiate? Here is cotton growing on\r\nyour land and lemons also. That’s nature. Would you object to dipping\r\ncotton into lemon juice and using that as a contraceptive?”\r\n\r\nHe said positively that he would. For every argument I presented he\r\ncountered with “I would devise other methods,” but proposed none that\r\nwas not based on continence. He reiterated that women in order to\r\ncontrol the size of their families must “resist” their husbands, in\r\nextreme cases leave them.\r\n\r\nThose who listened to the interview declared that the Mahatma made\r\nconcessions he had never made before. He himself said to me, “This has\r\nnot been wasted effort. We have certainly come nearer together.”\r\nNevertheless, I knew it was futile to count on Gandhi to help the\r\nmovement in India; his state of mind would not change. After reading his\r\nautobiography, I thought I saw the cause of his inhibitions. He himself\r\nhad had the feeling which he termed lust, and he now hated it. It formed\r\nan emotional pivot in his brain around which centered everything having\r\nto do with sex. But there remained his kindness, his hospitality, his\r\narrangements for your comfort, which he duplicated again and again for\r\nvisitors who gave nothing, but instead received inspiration from him.\r\nAnd, furthermore, since humanity as a rule does little for itself and\r\nthe inert mass has to be upheaved to a point where it can gain\r\ninitiative, anyone who can arouse a nation of all classes and ages out\r\nof the incredible lethargy into which it has long been sunk and can stir\r\nup a people to hope is a great, even noble, person.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in contrast to Gandhi’s attitude towards birth control,\r\nRabindranath Tagore’s was a comfort. With Anna Jane and Joseph I set out\r\non the long trip to Calcutta—two-thirds of the breadth of India. Now you\r\nreally saw the country—the palms and banana trees, the natives getting\r\non trains, living in their tiny huts. These were of bamboo plastered\r\nwith mud and whitewashed; the floors were soaked with cow dung to harden\r\nthe dirt, and the roofs were thatched with straw. As we passed through\r\nvillage after village, I observed cows, goats, dogs, bullocks, all with\r\ntheir young, rambling in the streets, freely mixing with the people and\r\nscrambling out of the way when a whistle or bell sounded. Peddlers,\r\nbalancing on their heads trays heaped with oranges, walked up and down\r\nthe station platforms, calling their wares in a fascinating, sing-song\r\nmeter.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Bolpur beyond Calcutta at seven-thirty of an early\r\nDecember evening. Tagore’s son had been on the train and we went with\r\nhim to Santineketan, House of Peace, where Tagore lived and taught. The\r\ngrouping of buildings in the thousand-acre estate resembled that of an\r\nancient monastery, not so cozy or individual as Gandhi’s, but rather\r\ncold and bare. Before sunrise again I heard the chanting prayers of the\r\nstudents. Boys and girls together then went at six o’clock to study in\r\nthe mango grove or under the banyan trees, all in the open air.\r\n\r\nHis former luxurious home Tagore had turned over to his son, and himself\r\noccupied a small clay house designed like a temple in modern style. The\r\nroom into which I was shown in the afternoon was full of books and\r\npapers, like the office of a busy executive. Tagore, in a long, rough,\r\nhandmade robe of homespun, was seated behind his desk. I had been told I\r\nwould find him greatly aged, but, although he was slightly thinner than\r\nwhen I had seen him in New York in 1931, he did not seem much older.\r\nTrue his beard and hair were scantier, but his face, almost unlined, had\r\nthe same repose, and his finely modulated voice expressed the same\r\nunderstanding when he spoke of the importance of birth control to his\r\ncountry, and sincerely hoped I would be able to reach the villagers,\r\nwhich he said must be done were it to bring any benefit to India.\r\n\r\nTagore knew I had been to see Gandhi, but did not mention it. He had\r\ntact combined with his grace and intellect; he drew, painted, directed\r\ndancing, even sculptured and acted. Appealing to more moneyed classes\r\nthan Gandhi, he guided his school towards furthering culture and the\r\narts as well as improving agricultural necessities.\r\n\r\nThe medical building in Calcutta had been selected for my first lecture\r\nthere, but Mr. O’Connor, who was in charge, refused permission. Since\r\nthe edifice belonged to the British Government, birth control became at\r\nonce popular with the Indians, and the meeting was transferred to Albert\r\nHall. I was warned we needed as chairman a good strong man with a\r\ndomineering personality, because it was a rowdy place and trouble-makers\r\nalways haunted it. However, the association which had asked me to speak\r\nhad already chosen a woman, Mrs. Soudamini Mehta, who was managing the\r\nclinic in Calcutta. I talked against the noise for forty minutes and\r\nthen Mrs. Mehta, whose voice scarcely carried over the footlights,\r\nopened the forum for questions.\r\n\r\nTwo bearded patriarchs looking like Messiahs were sitting in the front\r\nrow. One of them hopped up and, without asking a question, began\r\nharanguing in unctuous tones. Mrs. Mehta tried to stop him, but could\r\nnot. The audience tried to yell him down; a few were with him but most\r\nwere not. Then a fist fight broke out and the second sexagenarian rose\r\nand demanded recognition. Someone caught his hands from behind, and\r\nanother row began.\r\n\r\nFinally I said to Mrs. Mehta, “Perhaps they can hear me. Let’s ask them\r\nwhether they want to listen to these men.”\r\n\r\nAt once a mighty roar of “No!” went up. Then both the old men erupted\r\nagain, shrieking. Mrs. Mehta, anger lending strength to her vocal\r\nchords, at last called out indignantly, “You’re naughty, and the meeting\r\nis now dismissed!” And so, amid shouts of merriment, we broke up.\r\n\r\nI had no more lectures scheduled for a time, and accepted with pleasure\r\nthe invitation of Mrs. Norman Odling to visit her at Kalimpong, in the\r\nshadow of Mt. Everest, three hundred and fifty miles north of Calcutta.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for this excursion I had to decide whether to take Joseph.\r\nHe was a silent man. Whenever I had requested him to perform any\r\nservice, from getting the laundry together to looking after the luggage,\r\nhe had never answered yes or no but had only shaken his head—not a\r\nregular shake, but a nodding from side to side as though he were saying,\r\n“Well, well, well!” I had usually sighed, “Never mind.” I had grown\r\nrather exasperated with what seemed his deplorable lack of enthusiasm,\r\nalthough Anna Jane appeared to like him; being busy in other directions,\r\nespecially with beaux, she had left many things for him to attend to.\r\nFinally I informed Cook’s that we were departing for the North and would\r\nlike somebody else. When their representative came around to\r\ninvestigate, he said to Joseph, “Do you wish to go with Mrs. Sanger?”\r\nJoseph shook his head.\r\n\r\n“There you are!” I exclaimed. “He doesn’t want to go.”\r\n\r\nAt that Joseph put up pleading hands and spoke in Hindustani.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he does,” said the Cook’s man. “When he shakes his head ‘no’ he\r\nmeans ‘yes.’”\r\n\r\nBefore we started Joseph mentioned to me how wintry it was in the\r\nHimalayas; he must have an overcoat. I asked whether he had ever been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did you have a coat then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did someone buy it for you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, always buy it for bearers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, where’s that coat?”\r\n\r\n“Worn out.”\r\n\r\nI questioned Cook’s about that also and was told, “He’s trying to do\r\nyou. Probably he already has two or three, and if you give him another\r\nhe’ll just sell it.”\r\n\r\nWe hardened our hearts, and Joseph had to get along without his coat.\r\n\r\nAs we progressed north the nights grew cold, the mornings cold, four in\r\nthe afternoon was cold. Joseph had changed to a hideous black hat which\r\nhe said was warmer than his turban, but he had no overcoat and began to\r\ncough.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Siliguri at six of a brisk morning, just in time to watch\r\nthe rose-colored dawn break over the snow-covered mountains. After a cup\r\nof hot but vile coffee we wrapped ourselves in rugs and off we went on\r\nthe full hour’s drive to Kalimpong, up and around hairpin curves, mostly\r\nfollowing the river, often through bits of jungle whence you knew a\r\ntiger might spring out on the road any minute. The scenery was the most\r\nsuperb I had ever seen, grander than the Rockies or Pyrenees or Alps, a\r\nblend of green tangle and white peaks touching the clear sky, with\r\nwreaths of clouds far below.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Kalimpong there was a distinct difference in the type of\r\nnative; Thibetans and Nepalese were frequent. The swarms of women looked\r\nlike squaws, although, instead of papooses, they carried on their backs\r\nhuge baskets of charcoal or from six to eight massive blocks of stone,\r\nall for six cents a day. No horses, no mules, no wagons, only women as\r\nbeasts of burden hauling these rocks from the quarry to the site,\r\njingling with rings on their ankles and rings on their toes. What struck\r\nme as most peculiar was that many of them wore ugly shawls, assuredly\r\nproducts of Scottish mills; the entire hillside was dotted with plaids.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I reached Mrs. Odling’s home and heard the accent of her\r\nmedical missionary father, I knew the answer. “We never think of going\r\nhome to Scotland without bringing some back,” she said. “They much\r\nprefer plaids to their own designs.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Odling was a darling, born there in the hills, and was intensely\r\ninterested in cultivating the industries of the Thibetans, whom she\r\nencouraged to come across the border with their handsome silver boxes\r\nand brass bowls studded with turquoise. They were not a\r\npleasant-appearing people. It was almost ludicrous to see this delicate\r\nwoman slapping some of the worst-looking characters heartily on the\r\nshoulder and talking to them in their primitive language; it was evident\r\nthey adored her and would do anything for her.\r\n\r\nKalimpong itself was lovely and sunny, perched on an outer spur of the\r\neastern Himalayas; in the background soared up the mighty, snowy barrier\r\nof Kinchenjunga, which screened it from Thibet, and past it ran the\r\nhigh, chill, rocky road to Lhasa.\r\n\r\nTo reach Darjeeling, which was on the far side of a mountain range, it\r\nwas necessary to retrace our steps to Siliguri and then go along a\r\nmagnificent but treacherous road up another valley. Darjeeling itself\r\ndisappointed me, a hodgepodge of everybody and everything—tourists,\r\nriffraff, exorbitant prices on worthless articles, scarcely a few good\r\nones in gift shops. But I had the opportunity of buying for Grant the\r\nskin of a tiger shot in a recent hunt, and this beauty was packed in\r\nmoth balls and sent directly to the ship. Also a case of Darjeeling tea\r\nfrom one of the choicest gardens was delivered to me in Calcutta,\r\nwhither I now returned.\r\n\r\nThere a certain Dr. Ankelsaria, an Indian lecturer who had spoken in\r\nAmerica on psychology and psychic phenomena, established himself as my\r\ninterpreter and guide and dragged me willy-nilly to see such sights as\r\nthe Jain Temple and Crystal Palace. He overheard me telephoning for an\r\nappointment with Sir Jagardis Chandra Bose, famous for his ingenious\r\ntheory that plants breathed. He promptly said, “I know Sir Jagardis very\r\nwell; I’ll take you there.”\r\n\r\nI intimated that Anna Jane and I were the only ones invited, but he\r\nsaid, “Oh, that’s nothing. We all go there to tea quite often.” But when\r\nhe did not arrive at the designated hour we set off in a taxi, somewhat\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nSir Jagardis was a person of great dignity—elderly, polished, the\r\nscientist pure and simple. He seemed to me like a person trying to keep\r\nhis life clear, without having externals crowd in upon him too closely.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly finished our tea when to my surprise Dr. Ankelsaria\r\nappeared in the doorway and Sir Jagardis inquired, “Do you wish to have\r\nthis gentleman?” We explained he had offered to bring us in his car.\r\n\r\nSoon we walked out to see the garden, where plants of every description\r\nwere carefully tended, each treated like an only child—this one put to\r\nbed early, that one awakened by the sun, this shrank from noise, that\r\nloved running water, this craved a moist atmosphere, that needed a\r\ndesert in which to thrive; he understood the characteristics of each. He\r\nhimself was disturbed because his flowers did not like the presence of\r\nDr. Ankelsaria and would be affected by it.\r\n\r\nFrom there we stepped into the laboratory, where Sir Jagardis\r\ndemonstrated the working of his machine. When he placed either nitrogen\r\nor carbon on the plant the instrument, which had been almost quiescent,\r\nmade tiny marks, much as a person’s heartbeat was shown on a\r\ncardiograph.\r\n\r\nDr. Ankelsaria pushed in and got out a pencil and notebook. Sir Jagardis\r\nat once froze, ceased talking, and asked, “Are you a newspaper\r\nreporter?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m a doctor.”\r\n\r\n“What are you taking down? I’ll not have it!” Then, turning to me as\r\nthough I had been guilty of treachery, “My conversation with you was\r\npersonal and confidential.”\r\n\r\nI was profoundly embarrassed and, as severely as I knew how, requested\r\nDr. Ankelsaria to stop his writing immediately.\r\n\r\nThe night I was leaving Calcutta for Benares, the worthy doctor insisted\r\nI have dinner at his sister’s home, a real Indian feast. Among the\r\nguests was an amazing individual who greeted me as though we were old\r\nfriends, and I wondered where in heaven’s name I had ever known him.\r\nThen suddenly I remembered—Carnegie Hall four years earlier, jammed to\r\nthe doors, some woman relinquishing her seat because she thought the\r\nsubject of the lecture was more important for me than for her, then the\r\nappearance of the thick-set Swami from California, black hair hanging to\r\nhis shoulders, and my amazement that in good old America in the days of\r\nthe great depression five thousand people could be induced to chorus\r\nafter him in unison, “I am love, I am love,” swaying, hypnotized by\r\ntheir own rhythm, until the lofty hall vibrated and thundered. At the\r\nend of five minutes I had thanked the lady who had given me her place\r\nand tiptoed silently out.\r\n\r\nNow here in Calcutta I met again the Swami, clad in his ochre-colored\r\nrobe, back in India for the first time in many years. He inquired after\r\nmy health, assured me he had been aware of what I had been doing in\r\nAmerica, was so sorry I had not seen his home in Los Angeles. I said I\r\nwould visit him when next I went to California.\r\n\r\nInstead of being taken to the train in Ankelsaria’s unpretentious car, I\r\nwas transported in the Swami’s elegant Rolls-Royce with the top lowered.\r\nAs we went swishing through the streets, passers-by jumped on the\r\nrunning boards, dozens of others followed us, all wanting to touch the\r\nhem of the Swami’s robe. By the time we had reached the station there\r\nwere a hundred in our wake. I caught sight of Joseph at the gate, and on\r\nthe platform, with one eye out for me, was Anna Jane surrounded by her\r\nformal English friends in evening dress; the train was to depart in a\r\nfew minutes. When she saw me approaching with the Swami and his retinue\r\nshe dashed into the compartment to compose her features. Then we stood\r\nat the doorway as we pulled out to watch the Englishmen turning away a\r\nlittle stiffly, and the Swami, one of the incongruous but well-wishing\r\nacquaintances whom birth control attracts, waving a vigorous good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-eight_\r\n\r\n                          DEPTH BUT NOT TUMULT\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the cities of India Benares left the worst impression on me; so\r\nmany things exaggeratedly extolled do not live up to expectations. I\r\nnever encountered more confusion of religious symbols—the Temple of\r\nGold, the Monkey Temple, the Snake Temple—quite out of place in a holy\r\ncity. I did not like temples. They made me feel queer in the middle, so\r\nsmelly and such relics of ages gone by. Worshipers bowed low, resting\r\ntheir foreheads on the wet and slimy floors where thousands of people\r\nwere walking in and out. Around the doors were beggars—blind, maimed,\r\ndiseased. In the grounds were animals of every kind—monkeys, oxen,\r\nbuffaloes, goats for the sacrifice; vultures and crows were flying\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nMost foreigners disliked the Ganges, floating with horrors, but I found\r\nit at dawn comparatively clean, and by far the most attractive thing\r\nthere. We had risen early to see the Brahmins, the first-comers, men and\r\nwomen, old and young, bathing in the holy water. Mourners were sitting\r\non a hillock some twenty feet away from a burning ghat, still aflame,\r\nwaiting until the fire died down and the ashes could be swept into the\r\nriver. This seemed to me a more wholesome manner of dealing with the\r\ndead than the Western custom of burial.\r\n\r\nLater Joseph, whose cough was increasing, led us through the narrow\r\nstreets to the bazaars. Screaming mobs of vendors lured you towards lace\r\nshops or to buy brasses or silks. They came up to offer you cards. If\r\nyou took one, competitors shouted and yelled, “He’s a liar, a thief, a\r\nrobber, don’t go with him! His goods are fake!” Although some of the\r\nwares were exquisite, this ferocity again did not coincide with my\r\nconception of a holy city.\r\n\r\nAllahabad was more like a college town, and there I visited Mrs. Ranjit\r\nSitaram Pandit, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, whom I had met in\r\nLondon. Her home was old and spacious, a nucleus of intellectual thought\r\nand activity.\r\n\r\nShe sponsored a meeting to which about six hundred students came. It was\r\ninspiring to see fine young people attempting to weave together your\r\nphilosophy and theirs. They were extremely sensitive—more than most\r\naudiences, I think. But, as was the case with youth elsewhere, they made\r\nlight of anything that could be made light of. After the meeting free\r\nliterature was announced, and in two minutes it was a regular football\r\nrush. We had to throw the pamphlets over their heads to keep them from\r\nstampeding the platform in their headlong scramble.\r\n\r\nAt the Purdah Club the audience, of course, was entirely women; many, in\r\ntheir early twenties, already had large families. They were little\r\naccustomed to frank examination of such subjects, but, on the other\r\nhand, did not want mere theories. By the time questions were in order\r\nthey had recovered from their giggling and were ready to talk seriously.\r\nAs usual, some came up afterwards to query me personally on matters that\r\ncould better and more profitably have been discussed with all.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Agra we reserved the Taj Mahal for sunset. Fortunately, only\r\na few people were there, so that the quiet was intensified. Words are\r\ninadequate to describe its dignity and chastity; it seemed to breathe\r\nthe essence of beauty. It was not overwhelming, as were some of the\r\nworld’s wonders, but it had a perfect simplicity. I stayed until the sun\r\nsank, and in the afterglow the marble shone in a mystic effulgence, like\r\nsomething in another dimension reflected in the still, translucent pool.\r\nThere was not a cloud in the sky, just radiance everywhere. Before\r\ndaybreak I climbed again to the top of the gate tower and watched the\r\nrising sun cast its shadow on the dome. With reluctance I turned away to\r\ncatch the train for Baroda.\r\n\r\nAfter a long journey we arrived at the capital at three in the morning.\r\nI had been invited as a state guest, and, in spite of the hour, we were\r\nmet by the secretary under a handsome hat of red and gold and black.\r\nImmediately you felt a touch of Paris in the way clothes were worn in\r\nBaroda.\r\n\r\nArrangements had been made for my audience with the Gaekwar, who had\r\nbeen put on the throne by the British Government. He was a most\r\nprogressive ruler for his two and a half million subjects, aiming at\r\ncompulsory education and the abolition of caste restrictions. In the\r\nimmense anteroom of the Palace were ten or fifteen tall Indians with\r\ngorgeous turbans, who must have been more than just ordinary officials.\r\nThe Gaekwar, short, vigorous, alert, shook hands and recalled that he\r\nhad been President of the World Fellowship of Faith at Chicago, which he\r\nsaid had been the greatest honor of his life, and that he remembered my\r\ntalk there.\r\n\r\n“Her Highness wishes to meet you this afternoon. She is beginning to\r\nspend much time on health work and you must get her interested in what\r\nyou are doing. She will be a good friend to you.”\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour I went to see the Maharani, quite different from\r\nher husband, very grave, only recently out of purdah and still keeping a\r\nseparate palace. She knew hardly anything about birth control, but\r\nmaintained a welfare center for mothers and infants.\r\n\r\nI had heard from many sources that this class, that class, and the other\r\nclass would welcome or oppose birth control, none of which statements\r\nhad hitherto proved to be accurate. The State Medical Officer, who was\r\nvery close to the Maharani, had a further thesis which he stated as he\r\nwas taking me to the Maharani’s settlement, a little place where forty\r\nor fifty women, each one with a child, were sitting. “These women have\r\nbeen brought up to the duty of having children and are so shy and modest\r\nthat they would not listen to anything on birth control.”\r\n\r\nHe sounded as though he were antagonistic, but he was merely indicating\r\nthe difficulties as he saw them. I replied that I had never yet\r\nencountered women who, when the subject was put to them in a way they\r\ncould understand, were not eager to hear more. I suggested, “There’s a\r\nMohammedan who has a sickly baby. How old is she?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty.”\r\n\r\n“How many children has she?”\r\n\r\n“Three.”\r\n\r\n“Did she have more?”\r\n\r\n“Two died.”\r\n\r\n“How old is this one?”\r\n\r\n“Five or six months.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t she prefer to wait until this baby is strong and well before\r\nshe has any more?”\r\n\r\nThe woman had no opportunity to answer. The whole flock moved up. “I do!\r\nWe do! Has this lady something like that? That’s what we want!”\r\n\r\nThe medical officer was genuinely astonished. “I must tell this to her\r\nHighness.” When I myself saw the Maharani for the second time she spoke\r\nfar more favorably of birth control.\r\n\r\nEventually I was on my way to Trivandrum, capital of Travancore, to lend\r\nwhatever support I could towards the resolution for birth control at the\r\nAll-India Women’s Conference. The larger part of the population of this\r\nsemi-independent southern state was of Dravidian origin, among whom\r\nchild marriage scarcely existed. Here widows were allowed to remarry,\r\ndivorce was permissible for either party, and women occupied a unique\r\nposition because property descended to the children of a man’s sister\r\nrather than to his own.\r\n\r\nSome of the other state guests had already arrived. One charming girl\r\nespecially attracted me. She was warm-hearted, kindly, longing to serve\r\nhumanity, and prepared to dedicate her life to Gandhi’s teachings. When\r\nI asked her to what she intended to devote herself, she answered, “Show\r\nthe depressed classes that women of my type can clean their latrines. If\r\nI can do it, then they will see that it is not such an unworthy\r\noccupation after all.”\r\n\r\nBelieving this futile, I said, “Don’t you think perhaps you’re wasting\r\nyour efforts? Why not do something constructive, teach the mothers to\r\nwash and feed their children properly?”\r\n\r\nShe was determined, however, to sacrifice herself. “Gandhi wants the\r\nlatrines cleaned.”\r\n\r\nThe Maharani of Travancore, Sethu Parvathi Bai, was titular head of the\r\nConference, but the guiding spirit was a Parsee from Hyderabad, Mrs.\r\nRustomji Feridoonji, a woman in her fifties, hair almost white, a\r\nscholar with command of English, German, and French, with the polish of\r\nIndia and the West as well, alert and aware of everything going on in\r\nthe world. She and several like her were an inspiration to others of the\r\nEast and could put to shame many Westerners in their courage and vision.\r\nThey had seen immediately the necessity of having the movement under the\r\ncontrol of public health. In what was virtually a form of socialized\r\nmedicine municipalities were already sending out midwives, nurses, and\r\ndoctors to the poor classes. Wherever vaccination went, the birth\r\ncontrol advocates planned to follow with contraceptive information. With\r\nMrs. Feridoonji and the rest of the committee I helped to draw up a\r\nresolution to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe second afternoon the Maharani entertained at a garden party.\r\nFountains were splashing, lakes and pools were lustrous in the sunlight.\r\nThe dancing was executed by children and older girls, the couples moving\r\nround and round, precise little steps this way and that and up to each\r\nother without apparently lifting their feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Maharani and I took a short stroll together and she asked me\r\nparticularly to come to her palace the next morning at seven o’clock. I\r\nhad really no idea why she wanted to see me, and was uneasy, because the\r\ndebate over our resolution was to begin at nine. Nevertheless, I obeyed\r\nher behest. We started our conversation with a pleasant chat about\r\nbringing up children, especially when they were alone in the family\r\nwithout playmates. I realized she was hesitating over coming to the\r\npoint. All the time the minutes were slipping by.\r\n\r\nEventually she took the plunge; her situation as President of the\r\nCongress was very delicate. She had been warned that the Catholics would\r\nwithdraw from the Conference if the resolution were passed, and hoped,\r\ntherefore, I would not find it necessary to speak for it.\r\n\r\n“But,” I protested, “I’ve been invited especially to present this\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“You could substitute another subject which might be of greater\r\nimportance to India.”\r\n\r\n“But what?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she suggested, “why not brothels? It’s a disgrace to have\r\nbrothels in India—mind you, there are none in Travancore. Indian women\r\nwon’t mention them, but you’re an American—you can. What we need most is\r\nto do away with brothels.”\r\n\r\nI could readily see the Maharani’s position. Her social secretary was a\r\nCatholic, and large numbers of her Eurasian subjects were of the same\r\nfaith. But I said the needs of millions of women in India were more\r\nurgent than the demands of a few Catholic missionaries. She took it\r\nbeautifully and agreed. “I shall stay here because I feel the discussion\r\nought to be full and free,” she said. “I only want you to tell Mrs.\r\nFeridoonji to give your opponents two speakers for every one on your\r\nside.”\r\n\r\nThere was considerable heat. No Indian women were against it, only\r\nconverted Eurasians; all mothers were for it and all those against it\r\nwere unmarried. Never had I heard so much talk of the lusts and passions\r\nof men as from the latter. They put forth the same old arguments,\r\nabsolutely as though a phonograph record had been sent around the world.\r\nNothing could have been more monotonous, repeated as they were from\r\npress, platform, and books. You might challenge them, break them down,\r\ncorrect them, but to no avail. The greater the vehemence, the more\r\nbrilliant the opposition thought it had been. You had to ask yourself,\r\n“How did I phrase that answer twenty years ago?” We were utterly tired\r\nout when the vote was at last counted; we had won by eighty-four to\r\ntwenty-five. The Catholics kept their word. None came back that\r\nafternoon. But, since it was the end of the Conference, this also did\r\nnot matter.\r\n\r\nThe following day I was off to lecture in Madras, Anna Jane to visit in\r\nCeylon. The solicitous Joseph intimated he was needed more to pick up\r\nafter her than after me. “All right,” I agreed. “But you don’t have to\r\ntake the luggage with you. Put it in my compartment.” Joseph, however,\r\nmade a mistake and established me on the wrong train; it went no further\r\nthan Madura. The next morning about eleven everybody was told to get\r\nout, and there I was with seventeen pieces of luggage of my own and as\r\nmany more of Anna Jane’s.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that a young doctor of Calicut, Manjeri Sundaram, had at\r\nTrivandrum invited me to speak in his city. When I had replied that I\r\ncould not at this juncture, he had pleaded, “I’ll go wherever you go. I\r\nmust talk to you lots and lots and lots. Whenever you’re not sleeping if\r\nyou’ll allow me please to come with you and talk to you.” I had\r\ndiscouraged him in a most thorough manner, but now he came up to help\r\nwith my luggage and secured coolies to sit on it while we saw some\r\nthirty acres of temple.\r\n\r\nAt Madras, in the Tamil country, the turban-less natives were much\r\ndarker, the costumes white and uninteresting. Sir Vepa Ramasan took me\r\nin charge. He was a retired judge of the High Court, a very imposing man\r\nof means who had devoted much of his wealth to a little Malthusian\r\nmagazine and stirred things up ever since 1930. As was customary, the\r\nmeeting he had arranged was from five to six, a period which by\r\nOccidentals is spent ordinarily over tea, cocktails, or apéritifs, but\r\nput by the Indians to good use. The men had left their offices by that\r\ntime; it was cooler and still they could get home for dinner.\r\n\r\nSir Vepa, handsome, dominant, erect in bearing, not at all appearing his\r\nage, was chairman. Once my forty-minute talk was over, he called for\r\nquestions in his rich, clear voice. A man produced one I thought was\r\nsimple, but Sir Vepa eyed him severely, “That is not allowed!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ask it in a different way.” And he did so.\r\n\r\n“I still say it is not allowed!”\r\n\r\n“May I ask another?”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear it.”\r\n\r\nSir Vepa heard it, and dismissed it. “That’s in the same\r\ncategory—argument!”\r\n\r\nThe man jumped up and protested loudly. “Sit down!” roared Sir Vepa, and\r\nthe man sat as though he had been hit on the head.\r\n\r\nSomeone else, five or six seats off, brought up a new question, which\r\nalso seemed easy enough to answer. But again Sir Vepa ruled, “That does\r\nnot belong to the subject!”\r\n\r\nThe man wilted.\r\n\r\nNow the first questioner was passing a paper over his shoulder to a\r\nthird Indian who shook his head violently; he declined to be mixed up in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nQuery after query was disallowed. Finally a weak voice on the side asked\r\nabout the French birth rate. Sir Vepa turned on him and said, “You look\r\nlike an intelligent person, but if you have sat for forty minutes\r\nlistening to this address, and you have not understood it, then you are\r\nnot intelligent enough to warrant a lady’s coming ten thousand miles and\r\nwasting her breath!”\r\n\r\nThe audience was laughing at Sir Vepa’s judicial sternness. I, on the\r\nother hand, was rather depressed. As we were leaving I said to him, “I\r\nwish you had let me reply to them.”\r\n\r\nHis expression held surprise: “I’ve been answering them and battling\r\nwith these same people for twenty-five years. They only come to confuse.\r\nThey are enemies of the cause and I give them no quarter!”\r\n\r\nThat settled the situation in Madras.\r\n\r\nSince I was no more than an hour by motor from Adyar, the former home of\r\nAnnie Besant, who had been such an influence in the movement, I made a\r\npilgrimage there. As I walked down winding pathways under huge banyans,\r\ncocoanuts, and bananas, ever and again glimpsing the lovely water of the\r\nBay in the distance, I imagined I caught an echo of her words reaching\r\nacross the decade since I had heard her explain the philosophy of\r\nreincarnation: the more you have evolved here on earth, the less certain\r\nit is that you will have to return to undo your mistakes—best clear them\r\nup as you go along.\r\n\r\nAnnie Besant, as soon as she had become a Theosophist, had withdrawn her\r\nbooks on population. I was interested to find out the attitude of\r\npresent Theosophists towards birth control, and discovered that those at\r\nAdyar were persuaded of its importance. Among their beliefs was that\r\ngreat souls did not reincarnate unless the bodies of parents, their\r\nvehicles for birth, were perfect. If they were to perform their\r\nmissions, they must wait for purity in their physical vestures.\r\n\r\nI had determined to take advantage of Paul Brunton’s offer and visit Sri\r\nRamana Maharshi, the sage of Arunachala, the quondam Hermit of the Hill\r\nof the Holy Beacon, and one of the last of Hindustan’s race of noble\r\nrishis. Consequently, one evening a little after six, the train came\r\naround the bend and I beheld the sacred mountain, according to ancient\r\nlore the heart center of the god Siva and, therefore, of the world. I\r\nknew it must be _the_ mountain even without being told so. The sun had\r\njust set, and the afterglow gave a lovely, serene effect.\r\n\r\nThe Maharshi’s secretary, Shastri, met me, and we walked through the\r\ngathering dusk to the guest house about a half-mile away, a simple room\r\nwith veranda in front. Paul Brunton had not been able to come because it\r\nwas the Maharshi’s birthday and thousands of devotees had to be fed.\r\nShastri was very loquacious, and wanted me to realize that the apparent\r\nsuccess I was having was only with the educated classes; the masses knew\r\nnothing of it. This, I said, would come in time.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I looked out at the great tamarind trees on the lawn, up\r\nand down which monkeys ran. Often twenty, from babies up to\r\ngrandparents, were in sight all at once. The windows had to be\r\nbarricaded at night to shut them out of your room; they especially loved\r\nbananas but did not disdain cakes of soap.\r\n\r\nWhile I was watching them scamper about, Paul Brunton pedaled up on a\r\nbicycle accompanied by a tonga for me. The driver cried out continually,\r\n“Haiee! Haiee!” which seemed to mean both for people to get out of the\r\nroad and for the white bullock to move faster; he shouted himself hoarse\r\nat other drivers, who went higglety-pigglety this way and that through\r\nthe streets. We stopped at the market for a few bananas as a gift for\r\nthe Maharshi; he preferred food to flowers, because this he could give\r\naway. Then we trotted along through the thickly settled village, always\r\nhearing far and near the rumbling of the carts and the screeching of the\r\ndrivers, “Haiee! Haiee!”\r\n\r\nAt last we reached the _ashram_ at the bottom of the Hill. Shastri\r\ngathered up the bananas in his hands, but no sooner had he turned to\r\nhelp me out of the tonga than a temple monkey leaped from a neighboring\r\ntree, snatched two of them, and as quick as a flash had the skins off\r\nand had gobbled them down with no concern whatsoever as to the ethics of\r\nhis conduct. Instead, he peered around for another grab.\r\n\r\nShoes and sandals were left outside the _ashram_, and Shastri went ahead\r\nto announce my arrival. I bowed in the entrance and took my place on the\r\nfloor just within, crossed my legs under my skirt, and looked about me\r\nto feel and sense the atmosphere. The Maharshi, naked save for a loin\r\ncloth, was sitting cross-legged on a silk-covered couch, pillows behind\r\nhim and a leopard skin thrown over the foot. A small charcoal fire and\r\nincense, which attendants kept burning all day, sweetened and made heavy\r\nthe air. The Maharshi’s luminous eyes were fixed in a trance, although\r\nsometimes his fan lifted a bit and his stare widened.\r\n\r\nAt first it was nicely quiet; then some women began to sing in a\r\nhigh-pitched tone, much through the nose and head, doubtless good for\r\nthe pineal gland, once supposed to be the seat of the soul. The men\r\nchanted aloud and someone played a stringed instrument.\r\n\r\nTowards eleven the Maharshi shared his gifts among those who sat in\r\nreflection, and shortly afterwards a man from Kashmir, six feet tall and\r\nmassively built, entered, prostrated himself as hundreds had done\r\nalready, falling full length, hands outspread above him on the floor,\r\ntouching his brow three times. As he rose again his whole body shook,\r\ntears streamed down his cheeks. To see women cry from excess of emotion\r\ndid not bother me, but when a man of such a type as this, in no sense a\r\nweakling, went into paroxysms of ecstasy, it was beyond my\r\ncomprehension. With no critical intent, but curious to know why he had\r\nbeen so moved, we asked what had happened to him.\r\n\r\n“When I came into the Maharshi’s presence it was as though electricity\r\nhad passed through my body. I felt when I bowed I would be calmed, yet\r\nwhen I looked into those eyes, he was like a flame.”\r\n\r\nThis pilgrim had come with financial problems, illness in his family,\r\nand other troubles, but two or three hours of contemplation had wiped\r\nthem out; he knew they were insignificant and trivial in contrast to his\r\nregeneration. In faith, the people in the _ashram_ were comparable to\r\nthose who cast away their crutches at some miracle-working shrine,\r\nexcept that they had come for inner illumination rather than healing for\r\nbodily ailments. They visited the Maharshi to receive the radiance of\r\nhis soul, just as we sought the sun to be warmed.\r\n\r\nOnly when children or babies were made to prostrate themselves did the\r\nMaharshi smile, somewhat skeptically it seemed to me. He appeared amused\r\nwhen a boy of three or four began a prayer in Tamil but forgot the rest.\r\nOtherwise he remained apart from it all. He was gradually withdrawing\r\nhimself and letting go material things. He wanted spiritually to fade\r\naway, leaving the shell behind.\r\n\r\nThe second day the Maharshi slept; nothing save an occasional singer\r\nbroke into the hush, or a monkey had the temerity to dash in and seize\r\nan orange.\r\n\r\nFor the third day I attended the _ashram_. Now the meditation was like a\r\nlinking up of mind and emotion, where even breathing was stilled. I\r\ncould understand why the yogis went into the silence. Even the noises\r\nnext door, the clatter of dishes, sounded remote and very far away. It\r\nwas a state of consciousness rather like that which precedes sleep.\r\n\r\nI regretted that I did not feel the Maharshi’s power. His utter\r\nindifference—sitting all day in a semi-trance, engaging in no\r\nactivity—seemed to me a waste. Nevertheless, I was most grateful to Paul\r\nBrunton for the experience, and understood the Indians better\r\nthereafter. They saw within and beyond the external appearance; this was\r\nat the very basis of their character, akin to the sensitivity of the\r\ngrapevine telegraph. All people in the Orient spoke of it. Something\r\nhappened to you or to me and before you could get to another place by\r\nthe fastest conveyance it was known. Perhaps it was a primitive function\r\nof mind, this form of thought transference, but it existed there.\r\n\r\nDr. Sundaram, who popped up again when I returned to Madras, was still\r\ninsistent that I go to Calicut, and I finally gave in. I was glad I had\r\ndone so, because this city of forty thousand, ringed around a bay on the\r\nMalabar Coast and caressed by gentle breezes, was a beautiful spot with\r\nforests of palms. The almost-black women wore saris of vari-colored\r\nblues and greens, violets and yellows, with garlands of jasmine about\r\ntheir necks, plump, formal bouquets of roses in their hands, and in the\r\ncenter of every forehead was a circular red caste mark.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held in the courtyard of a Buddhist temple. The sun was\r\nsetting and part of the shell-pink sky was melting into deep carmine,\r\nlike a flower. Directly in front sat three priests, each with shaved\r\nhead, orange robe, and thick stave. Hundreds of rooks were chattering\r\nand other birds twittering in the trees, children were shouting at their\r\ngames, the shrill chant of pilgrims walking through the streets\r\nsaturated the dust-filled dusk. Mainly you heard the tinkling of the\r\nbullocks going up and down the road. The audience sat in utter silence\r\nsurrounded by all these sounds.\r\n\r\nTwo days later we motored through the heavy woods to Mysore. Joseph,\r\nstill coughing until it racked his frame, had rejoined me. I took my\r\nlittle drug shop and administered Vitamin A and D tablets, curing him\r\nand achieving thereby a reputation. Other Indians began hunting up colds\r\nand asthma and pains, and coming to me to give them some American\r\nmedicine, in which they had much faith.\r\n\r\nSoon I was on the train to Bangalore, again as state guest. The Dewan of\r\nMysore, Sir Mirza Ismail, knew everybody in Europe, was well informed on\r\nWestern methods of health, and was full of ideas about public buildings,\r\nroads, streets, industries, and the great dam which was to furnish\r\nelectricity for the state. He was the first person in India who inquired\r\nafter Katherine Mayo. I had been expecting to meet antagonism because of\r\n_Mother India_, which I myself now considered misleading. Certainly the\r\nconditions when I was there seemed vastly different from those she had\r\ndepicted only a few years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe British believed every word true, but most of the Indians I saw\r\nlooked upon Miss Mayo as having gone into their homes and then betrayed\r\ntheir confidences. They claimed she was definitely prejudiced, and, like\r\nthe clever craftsman she was, had fixed her statistics. For example,\r\nwhen she discussed the age of marriage, she made sweeping statements and\r\nquoted on page so and so of such and such a report; you turned there and\r\nthey were correct, and that was the reason for the astounding acceptance\r\nof her book. Nevertheless, she had violated the spirit, because two\r\npages further in the same report followed an explanation of, or\r\nexception to, her conclusions.\r\n\r\nMirza Ismail, a Mohammedan, thought she had benefited Indians by shaking\r\nthem awake, and that the facts she had brought out, even if not true of\r\nall the country, should be corrected; that India had to defend herself\r\nwas good for her.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Hyderabad, which was pleasant and social, and after\r\nseeing this startling landscape in which the mountains seemed to have\r\nbeen smashed by a giant maul into enormous pieces, I started towards\r\nhome. India was a land of dramatic contrasts—the highest mountains, the\r\nhottest plains, the densest jungles, the most violent rains. The\r\nloveliest architecture in the world was set against a background of\r\nnauseating squalor. Wealth beyond calculation existed alongside poverty\r\nthat was living death, dazzling mental attainments beside an ignorance\r\nutterly abysmal. I could not tell precisely what the results of the trip\r\nhad been; these rarely came immediately. And, if you had to hammer away\r\nand hammer away for years in the United States, you had to do it ten\r\ntimes over in India.\r\n\r\nA terrific change in temperature froze me at Hong Kong; the poor huddled\r\naround little fires in the streets. Dr. Arthur Woo, a Rockefeller\r\nFoundation protégé, enthusiastic, full of energy, like magic procured\r\nquarters for me in one of the crowded hotels on the top floor, quiet and\r\nrestful but, oh, how cold!\r\n\r\nAccording to my schedule I was to remain twenty-four hours, into which\r\nwere to be crammed a lunch, a tea, a lecture, a Chinese supper, and a\r\npublic meeting. Then I decided to stay over a day for a medical\r\ngathering. Ho Kum Tong, a wealthy Chinese, provided another luncheon in\r\nhis beautiful home.\r\n\r\nIn Hong Kong I heard rumors of a practical scholar in eugenics, in which\r\nthe Chinese were very much interested. He was said to have, in addition\r\nto a wife, thirty concubines, by each of whom he had had three children.\r\nOne of the Negro offspring—tall, kinky-haired, and oblique-eyed—was a\r\nmost extraordinary-looking youth; he did not appear to belong anywhere.\r\nThe daughters were much larger of stature than the average Chinese; all\r\nwere educated and doing excellent work. Not only the features of the\r\ncultured types on the Island, but even those of the coolies, the\r\nlongshoremen, struck me as growing less Oriental and more Anglo-Saxon,\r\nthe foreheads fuller, the eyes less slanting.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Japan I found that Westernization had leaped ahead. Tokyo\r\nwas not the same city I had seen in 1922—automobiles and wide-paved\r\nstreets, many bicycles, many men and small children in European dress.\r\nEverywhere also was an atmosphere of tenseness on account of the\r\nassassination of the cabinet members about ten days before. Telephone\r\ncommunication in English was forbidden; people in Yokohama were unable\r\nto get to Tokyo because all transportation was cut off. War seemed\r\ninevitable. Baroness Ishimoto told me the activities of her organization\r\nhad been curtailed, but articles and discussion and the spreading of\r\nknowledge had continued. The dissemination now was as it had been in\r\nFrance—from house to house, family to family, by word of mouth instead\r\nof under proper auspices.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a dismal voyage to Honolulu, I had hardly registered at\r\nthe hotel when I heard a feminine voice in my ear, “Are you Mrs.\r\nSanger?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nDr. Muriel Cass, as this welcoming committee turned out to be, knew that\r\nI was recently out of a hospital, and disappeared for a few moments to\r\ntelephone for a doctor. When he arrived she said, “All we want of you is\r\nto give Mrs. Sanger something to keep her going. She’s got eight\r\nlectures to deliver.”\r\n\r\nI felt like a poor old war horse being fed the last measure of oats. I\r\nhad a horrible memory of two weeks of fog and rain and cold at Memorial\r\nHospital in Hong Kong, and now here I was to die in Honolulu.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Cass, an efficient, self-sacrificing manager, did the most\r\namazing things for me. She ordered the telephone operator to switch\r\nevery call to her. There I was, quite alone. Nobody could see me or even\r\ntalk to me; I must conserve my strength for the meetings. Repeatedly she\r\nrushed me to and from halls, put me in cars, and trundled me off to bed.\r\nReally I was better after each lecture than I had been before. When I\r\nleft Honolulu she herself was so worn out she had to take a vacation,\r\nbut I was nearly well.\r\n\r\nThe hospitality and luxuriance of this Pacific paradise were almost\r\nindescribable. Hula-hulas at the hotels, bathing on the beaches,\r\noutriggers swooping in, the native women in great flowered Mother\r\nHubbards twining leis, the songs they sang, the air of leisure and fun\r\nand play, these made Honolulu a city apart. It was the sounding board of\r\nthe Orient, people going, people coming back, but all there to enjoy\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn Honolulu I repacked and, to save space, stuffed Grant’s tiger skin in\r\nthe trunk around my box of Darjeeling tea. When, four weeks later, I\r\nripped off the cover at Willow Lake, it was reeking with camphor. I\r\ntried to aerate the leaves, dry them out, fumigate them with sunshine,\r\nbut it remained moth ball tea. One package I had given away before I\r\ndiscovered the tragedy. Its receipt was ignored. No thank-you letter, no\r\nmention of it. The other friends to whom I had planned to present this\r\nchoice gift had to go without.\r\n\r\nI spent the summer at Willow Lake and in the winter, remembering Arizona\r\nfrom the time I had been there with Stuart, went out again in response\r\nto the summons of the desert. My husband and I found a house near Tucson\r\nof adobe, trimmed in blue. The mountains, not distant or aloof or\r\ntowering over all, reached into the sky, but they were also somehow\r\nintimate, cupping the town gently on all four sides.\r\n\r\nYou settled there in the Catalina foothills and felt such a part of the\r\nwhole. The first thing when you opened your eyes, before actual dawn,\r\nyou beheld the gold and purple and then the entire sky break into color.\r\nIn the evening the sunsets were reflected on the mountains in\r\npink-lavender shades; sometimes the glow sprayed from the bottom upward,\r\nlike the footlights of a theater, until the tips were aflame. Sunset\r\nvanished as quickly as sunrise, never lingering long.\r\n\r\nWhen the marvel of spring came to the desert, you saw the cactus and the\r\nflowering, saw the brown floor change to delicate pale yellow, stood in\r\nawe of nature daring to live without water. You were reminded of the\r\nfutility of wearing out your life merely providing food and raiment.\r\nLike the challenge of death, which so many of the people there were\r\ngallantly facing, the desert itself was a challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Chapter Thirty-nine_\r\n\r\n                    SLOW GROWS THE SPLENDID PATTERN\r\n\r\n        “_There is no force in the world so great as that of an\r\n        idea when its hour has struck._”\r\n\r\n                                                     VICTOR HUGO\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back at the past is like peering from some promontory upon a\r\nvaried landscape. The years run through it like a road winding through a\r\nvalley. With the passage of time you get a far-sweeping view, and the\r\nsmall details become blurred and difficult to recall. I wonder whether\r\nthere should not be a school course to emphasize the importance of\r\nkeeping diaries, so that you would know the really momentous happenings\r\nto put down. Mostly you scribble notes intended to call up a picture\r\nrather than an actual account of what has happened—memoranda of dates,\r\nengagements and events, leaving the results to recollection. Some\r\ninequality in this chronicle as to what is significant and what is\r\nnot—some gaps in my remembrance of events—may have been the result.\r\n\r\nIt is strange what tricks the mind can play. My father, the person who\r\nhad done most in shaping my growth, died in 1926 at the age of eighty.\r\nThe day he was buried in Corning I was passing the bank on the corner of\r\nthe town square with my brothers Dick and Bob, and we chanced to glance\r\nsimultaneously at the clock tower. Faintly startled, we gazed at each\r\nother and Dick exclaimed, “Look at that little tiny thing! I’ve always\r\nthought it was as big as the Eiffel Tower!”\r\n\r\nIn all of our travels each of us had been convinced that nothing ever\r\nwas so tall as that tower. That can happen to so many youthful memories.\r\nMonths and miles that seemed so long then are so short later.\r\n\r\nThe same year that took my father summoned also my sister Mary, whose\r\ncruel immolation at the shrine of family duty had obliged her to forego\r\nmarriage; even though I had seen her but seldom, she, too, had had an\r\nimportant influence over me and remained a dear presence whose loss I\r\nfelt deeply. Out of eleven children seven are still living. Families\r\nhave a separate and distinct role in your existence. They are closer yet\r\nmore apart than friends, but often you discover that you have nothing\r\nsave the ties of childhood to keep you together.\r\n\r\nWhat I have been able to contribute to the birth control movement has\r\nbeen the result of forces which set a clear design almost from infancy,\r\neach succeeding circumstance tracing the lines more sharply: my being\r\nborn into a family so large as to be in part responsible for my mother’s\r\npremature death; my preparation as a nurse, which awoke me to the\r\nsorrows of women; the inspiration of having come into contact with great\r\nminds and having claimed many as friends. It may have been destiny as\r\nsome have said—I do not know.\r\n\r\nTo have helped carry the cause thus far has been at times strenuous, but\r\nI have never considered it a sacrifice. Every conscious hour, night and\r\nday, in any city, in any country, has brought its compensations. My life\r\nhas been joyous and exulting and full because it has touched profoundly\r\nmillions of other lives. It is ever a privilege to be a part of\r\nsomething unquestionably proved of value, something so fundamentally\r\nright.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time wonder is expressed that so much has been accomplished\r\nin so short a period. The fact remains that in an era when huge fortunes\r\nhave been spent in alleviating human misery progress has been painfully\r\nslow. Countless women still die before their time because the bit of\r\nknowledge essential to every life is still not theirs. Birth control\r\nmust seep down until it reaches the strata where the need is greatest;\r\nuntil it has been democratized there can be no rest.\r\n\r\nIt is true that great advances have been made in the realm of theory.\r\nYou can almost tell people’s age now by their attitude towards birth\r\ncontrol. To the young it is merely one of the accepted facts; if\r\nquestioned, they assume the whole matter must have been settled long\r\nago.\r\n\r\nOver and over again in the past a new epoch has adopted a concept\r\ncensured by the preceding one, and has wondered derisively how its\r\nforefathers could have been so blind to anything so obvious. The use of\r\nanesthetics for mothers in childbirth was once condemned as an unholy\r\nattempt to escape the Biblical curse pronounced against all women, and,\r\nsimilarly, evolution as striking at the roots of Christianity. Battles\r\nover impiety, heresy, blasphemy, obscenity have been fought, temporarily\r\nlost, and finally won. Science whittles away such obstructions little by\r\nlittle. “The Moving Finger writes; and having writ moves on.” In\r\nJanuary, 1937, in that same Town Hall where fifteen years before I had\r\nbeen forbidden to speak, and whence I had been haled into court, I was\r\nhonored with a medal. Pearl Buck said on one occasion, “The cause\r\nconquers because youth is for you. I have lived in China so long, and\r\nknow what it is to wait until the old ones die and the young can do what\r\nis necessary to be done.” I am glad both my sons are doctors with a\r\nbackground of human interest to which has been added a scientific\r\nquality of mind that can aid in pushing the horizon of service further\r\ninto the future.\r\n\r\nI am often asked, “Aren’t you happy now that the struggle is over?” But\r\nI cannot agree that it is. Though many disputed barricades have been\r\nleaped, you can never sit back, smugly content, believing that victory\r\nis forever yours; there is always the threat of its being snatched from\r\nyou. All freedom must be safeguarded and held. Jubilation is unwarranted\r\nwhile the world is in warring turmoil, each political unit trying to\r\nhold on to what it has—some threatening to take it away and others\r\nlooking covetously towards outlets in countries not yet completely\r\nfilled. The application of the movement to nations which should, in the\r\ninterests of peace, control their populations, must endure.\r\n\r\nBefore 1914 the world trend was towards unity and peace. But a typhoon\r\nthen caught us and turned us upside down. We began to whirl violently in\r\none direction—that of individual and national emancipation, until at\r\nlast the great wind blew crowns from the heads of Tsars and Kaisers,\r\nsweeping power into the hands of the populace.\r\n\r\nWhen that War had first burst upon a shocked world people everywhere\r\nstood aghast and wept for the slaughter of men they did not know. But\r\nafter four years, in self-defense, they armored themselves against the\r\nemotion which should be aroused by any cruelty, and became calloused and\r\nhardened until the deaths of thousands left nations unmoved.\r\n\r\nThen came the vortex, the center, of the storm, and we awaited\r\nbreathless the approach of the opposite edge. Everything had been lashed\r\ndown in readiness, the life lines had been strengthened. Finally, all we\r\nhad considered constant in rational thought, morals, ethics, started to\r\ngo with equal violence in the other direction towards dictatorship and\r\nnationalism and race prejudice—a giving over of individual freedom. The\r\nimmediacy of the deaths of women in childbirth seemed so small in\r\ncomparison, of so little consequence; no longer were felt the pains of\r\nproblems which used to be of such deep concern.\r\n\r\nOver and over again I hear, “How do you fit birth control into a world\r\nin which dictators are clamoring for more and yet more people?” I can\r\nonly answer that momentum must now derive its power from some other\r\nsource than arousing sympathy. The present insensitivity is due to a\r\nhorror of hovering peril. Many will be swept away and destroyed but when\r\nthe battered hulls of the various ships of state emerge into calmer\r\nseas, a lesson may have been learned, perhaps, whereby these vessels may\r\nbe made more seaworthy.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, with their innate genius for dramatizing basic truths in\r\nimages of telling beauty, established of old the relay torch race, or\r\nLampadephoria, in honor of the Titan Prometheus, who had bestowed the\r\ndivine gift of fire upon humanity. The contest was held at night, the\r\ngreat flambeaux being appropriately kindled at the altar of Eros.\r\nParticipation was not a distinction indiscriminately conferred; those\r\nelect were fitted by discipline to hand on the vital flame, just as\r\nparents need training before becoming eligible for their grave\r\nresponsibilities. The figures speeding around the course symbolize the\r\npassing on of the spark of life from generation to generation. Each\r\nrunner must deliver his torch undimmed to his successor.\r\n\r\n“Build thou beyond thyself,” said Nietzsche, and this the birth control\r\nmovement is doing. All peoples will in the future have greater regard\r\nfor the quality of the bodies and brains which must be equipped for the\r\ntask of building the future civilization; birth control will be the\r\ncornerstone of that great structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abbott, Leonard, 74\r\n\r\n Abortion, 89ff., 217, 285, 449, 450\r\n\r\n Academy of Medicine, 181, 358, 404, 405, 410\r\n\r\n Ackermann, Frances Brooks, 188, 260, 261, 392, 395, 417\r\n\r\n Adams, Maude, 37, 38\r\n\r\n Agra, 479\r\n\r\n Albany, N.Y., 208, 292, 411\r\n\r\n Aldred, Guy, 136, 274\r\n\r\n Allahabad, 479\r\n\r\n Allison, Van Kleek, 207, 211\r\n\r\n American Birth Control League, 300, 359, 369, 392ff., 409, 415\r\n\r\n American Civil Liberties Union, 309\r\n\r\n American Federation of Labor, 78, 80, 421\r\n\r\n American Medical Association, 416, 421, 430\r\n\r\n American Public Health Association, 298\r\n\r\n American Women’s Association, 413\r\n\r\n Ankelsaria, Dr., 476ff.\r\n\r\n Anti-Religious Museum, Leningrad, 440\r\n\r\n Arizona, 459, 460, 491\r\n\r\n Armory Exhibition, N.Y., 68\r\n\r\n Ashley, Jessie, 71, 96, 100, 101, 207, 232, 234, 252, 264\r\n\r\n Astor, Lady Nancy, 390, 391\r\n\r\n Atlanta Ga., 413\r\n\r\n\r\n Bamberger, Charles J., 176, 258\r\n\r\n Barber, Billy, 434\r\n\r\n Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, 462, 463\r\n\r\n Barcelona, 154ff.\r\n\r\n Baroda, 479ff.;\r\n   Maharani of, 480, 481\r\n\r\n Barr, Sir James, 272\r\n\r\n Bass, Mrs. Robert P., 459\r\n\r\n Batum, 455\r\n\r\n Bavaria, 287ff.\r\n\r\n Bedborough Trial, 135\r\n\r\n Bell, George H., Commissioner of Licenses, 252\r\n\r\n Bellamy, Edward, 268\r\n\r\n Bellows, George, 74\r\n\r\n Belmont, Mrs. O.
