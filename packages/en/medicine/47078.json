It is designed for the student and\r\npractitioner, not for the trained laboratory worker. It had its origin\r\nsome years ago in a short set of notes which the author dictated to\r\nhis classes, and has gradually grown by the addition each year of such\r\nmatter as the year's teaching suggested. The eagerness and care with\r\nwhich the students and some practitioners took these notes and used\r\nthem convinced the writer of the need of a volume of this scope.\r\n\r\nThe methods offered are practical; and as far as possible are those\r\nwhich require the least complicated apparatus and the least\r\nexpenditure of time. Simplicity has been considered to be more\r\nessential than absolute accuracy. Although in many places the reader\r\nis given the choice of several methods to the same end, the author\r\nbelieves it better to learn one method well than to learn several only\r\npartially.\r\n\r\nMore can be learned from a good picture than from any description,\r\nhence especial attention has been given to the illustrations, and it\r\nis hoped that they will serve truly to _illustrate_. Practically all\r\nthe microscopic structures mentioned, all apparatus not in general\r\nuse, and many of the color reactions are shown in the pictures.\r\n\r\nAlthough no credit is given in the text, the recent medical\r\nperiodicals and the various standard works have been freely consulted.\r\nAmong authors whose writings have been especially helpful may be\r\nmentioned v. Jaksch, Boston, Simon, Wood, Emerson, Purdy, Ogden,\r\nEwald, Ehrlich and Lazarus, Da Costa, Cabot, Osler, Stengel, and\r\nMcFarland.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes hereby to express his indebtedness to Dr. J. A.\r\nWilder, Professor of Pathology in the Denver and Gross College of\r\nMedicine, for aid in the final revision of the manuscript; and to\r\nW. D. Engel, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry, for suggestions in regard\r\nto detection of drugs in the urine. He desires to acknowledge the care\r\nwith which Mr. Ira D. Cassidy has made the original drawings, and also\r\nthe uniform courtesy of W. B. Saunders Company during the preparation\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\nJ. C.

usefulness depends so\r\nmuch upon proper manipulation as the microscope, and none is so\r\nfrequently misused by beginners. Some suggestions as to its proper use\r\nare, therefore, given at this place. It is presumed that the reader is\r\nalready familiar with its general construction (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The microscope: 1, Eye-piece; 2, draw-tube; 3,\r\nmain tube; 4, nose-piece with objectives attached; 5, objective in\r\nposition; 6, stage; 7, substage; 8, adjustment of substage; 9, mirror;\r\n10, coarse adjustment; 11, fine adjustment.]\r\n\r\nIllumination.--Good work cannot be done without proper illumination.\r\nIt is difficult to lay too much stress upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe best light is that from a white cloud. {18} A northern exposure is\r\ndesirable, since direct sunlight is to be avoided. Good work can be\r\ndone at night with a Welsbach light. Ordinary gas-light and the\r\nincandescent electric light are unsatisfactory, although the latter\r\ngives good results when subdued with a heavily frosted globe. The\r\nwriter uses a frosted electric bulb in a dark-room lantern, and tones\r\nthe light to the proper degree for low powers by means of\r\nfrosted-glass plates which slide into the grooves which have held the\r\nruby and orange glasses. One of these plates is made of blue glass, to\r\novercome the yellow of the artificial light. It is not generally\r\nadvised to do so, but it will be found convenient to use the Abbé\r\ncondenser for all routine work. With daylight it is best to use the\r\nplane mirror: with artificial light, the concave mirror. To obtain\r\nbest results, the light must be focused upon the object under\r\nexamination by raising or lowering the condenser.\r\n\r\nIllumination may be either _central_ or _oblique_. Central\r\nillumination is to be used for all routine work. To obtain this, the\r\nmirror should be so adjusted that the light from the source selected\r\nis reflected directly up the tube of the microscope. This is easily\r\ndone by removing the eye-piece and looking down the tube while\r\nadjusting the mirror. The eye-piece is then replaced, and the light\r\nreduced as much as desired by means of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nOblique illumination is to be used only to bring out certain\r\nstructures more clearly after viewing them by central light: as, for\r\nexample, to show the edges of a hyaline cast by throwing one of its\r\nsides into shadow. Oblique illumination is obtained in the more simple\r\ninstruments by swinging the mirror to one side, so that the light\r\nenters the microscope obliquely. The more {19} complicated instruments\r\nobtain it by means of a rack and pinion, which moves the diaphragm\r\nlaterally. Beginners frequently use oblique illumination without\r\nrecognizing it. If the light be oblique, an object in the center of\r\nthe field will appear to move from side to side when the fine\r\nadjustment is turned back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe amount of light is even more important than its direction. It is\r\nregulated by the diaphragm. _It is always best to use the least light\r\nthat will show the object well._ Unstained objects require very\r\nsubdued light. Beginners constantly use it too strong. Strong light\r\nwill often render semitransparent structures, as hyaline casts,\r\nentirely invisible (Figs. 2 and 3). Stained objects, especially\r\nbacteria, require much greater light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Hyaline casts, one containing renal cells;\r\nproperly subdued illumination (from Greene's \"Medical Diagnosis\").]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Same as Fig. 2; strong illumination. The casts\r\nare lost in the glare, and only the renal cells are seen (from\r\nGreene's \"Medical Diagnosis\").]\r\n\r\nIf the reflection of the window-frame or other nearby object is seen\r\nin the field, the condenser should be lowered a little.\r\n\r\nFocusing.--It is always best to \"focus up,\" which saves annoyance and\r\nprobable damage to slides and objectives. This is accomplished by\r\nbringing the objective {20} nearer the slide than the proper focus,\r\nand then, with the eye at the eye-piece, turning the tube up until the\r\nobject is clearly seen. _The fine adjustment should be used only to\r\nget an exact focus with the higher power objectives after the\r\ninstrument is in approximate focus._ It should not be turned more than\r\none revolution.\r\n\r\nThere will be less fatigue to the eyes if both are kept open while\r\nusing the microscope, and if no effort is made to see objects which\r\nare out of distinct focus. Fine focusing should be done with the fine\r\nadjustment, not with the eye. An experienced microscopist keeps his\r\nfingers almost constantly upon one or other of the focusing\r\nadjustments. Greater skill in recognizing objects will be acquired if\r\nthe same eye be always used. To be seen most clearly, an object should\r\nbe brought to the center of the field.\r\n\r\nMagnification.--The degree of magnification should always be expressed\r\nin _diameters_, not _times_, which is a misleading term. The former\r\nrefers to increase of _diameter_; the latter, to increase of _area_.\r\nThe comparatively low magnification of 100 diameters is the same as\r\nthe apparently enormous magnification of 10,000 times.\r\n\r\nMagnification may be increased--(_a_) by using a higher power\r\nobjective, which is the best way; (_b_) by using a higher eye-piece;\r\nor (_c_) by increasing the length of tube.\r\n\r\nEye-pieces and Objectives.--The usual equipment consists of one- and\r\ntwo-inch eye-pieces, and two-thirds, one-sixth, and one-twelfth inch\r\nobjectives. These are very satisfactory for clinical work. It is an\r\nadvantage to add a one-half-inch eye-piece for occasional use with the\r\ntwo-thirds objective. The one-sixth should have an especially long\r\nworking distance, otherwise it cannot be used satisfactorily with the\r\nThoma-Zeiss blood-counting {21} instrument, which has a very thick\r\ncover-glass. Such a \"special one-sixth for blood work\" is made by most\r\nof the microscope manufacturers.\r\n\r\nObjectives are \"corrected\" for use under certain fixed conditions, and\r\n_they will give the best results only when used under the conditions\r\nfor which corrected_. The most important corrections are: (_a_) For\r\ntube length; (_b_) for thickness of cover-glass; and (_c_) for the\r\nmedium between objective and cover-glass.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The tube length with which an objective is to be used is usually\r\nengraved upon it--in most cases it is 160 mm.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The average No. 2 cover-glass is about the thickness for which\r\nmost objectives are corrected. Low powers do not require any\r\ncover-glass. A cover should always be used with high powers, but its\r\nexact thickness is more important in theory than in practice.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The correction for the medium between objective and cover-glass\r\nis very important. This medium may be either air or some fluid, and\r\nthe objective is hence either a \"dry\" or an \"immersion\" objective. The\r\nimmersion fluid generally used is cedar oil, which gives great optical\r\nadvantages because its index of refraction is the same as that of\r\ncrown glass. It is obvious that only objectives with very short\r\nworking distance, as the one-twelfth, can be used with an immersion\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nTo use an oil-immersion objective a drop of the cedar oil which is\r\nprepared for the purpose should be placed upon the cover, and the\r\nobjective lowered into it and then brought to a focus in the usual\r\nway. Immediately after use the oil should invariably be wiped off with\r\nlens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief moistened with saliva.\r\n\r\nCare of the Microscope.--The microscope is a {22} delicate instrument\r\nand should be handled accordingly. It is so heavy that one is apt to\r\nforget that parts of it are fragile. It seems unnecessary to say that\r\nwhen there is unusual resistance to any manipulation, force should\r\nnever be used to overcome it until its cause has first been sought;\r\nand yet it is no uncommon thing to see students, and even graduates,\r\npush a high power objective against a microscopic preparation with\r\nsuch force as to break not only the cover-glass, but even a heavy\r\nslide.\r\n\r\nIt is most convenient to carry a microscope with the fingers grasping\r\nthe pillar and the arm which holds the tube; but since this throws a\r\nstrain upon the fine adjustment, it is safer to carry it by the base.\r\nTo bend the instrument at the joint, the force should be applied to\r\nthe pillar and never to the tube or the stage.\r\n\r\nLens surfaces which have been exposed to dust only should be cleaned\r\nwith a camel's-hair brush. Those which are exposed to finger-marks\r\nshould be cleaned with lens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief wet\r\nwith saliva. Particles of dirt which are seen in the field are upon\r\nthe slide, the eye-piece, or the condenser. Their location can be\r\ndetermined by moving the slide, rotating the eye-piece, and lowering\r\nthe condenser.\r\n\r\nOil and balsam which have dried upon the lenses and resist saliva may\r\nbe removed with alcohol or xylol; but these solvents must be used\r\nsparingly and carefully, as there is danger of softening the cement.\r\nCare must be taken not to get any alcohol upon the brass parts, as it\r\nwill remove the lacquer. Balsam and dried oil are best removed from\r\nthe brass parts with xylol.\r\n\r\nMeasurement of Microscopic Objects.--Of the several methods, the most\r\nconvenient is the use of a {23} micrometer eye-piece. In its simplest\r\nform this is similar to an ordinary eye-piece, but has within it a\r\nglass disc upon which is ruled a graduated scale. When this eye-piece\r\nis placed in the tube of the microscope, the ruled lines appear in the\r\nmicroscopic field, and the size of an object is readily determined in\r\n_terms of the divisions of this scale_. The value of these divisions\r\nin inches or millimeters manifestly varies with different\r\nmagnifications. Their value must, therefore, be determined separately\r\nfor each objective. This is accomplished through use of a stage\r\nmicrometer--a glass slide with carefully ruled scale divided into\r\nhundredths and thousandths of an inch, or into subdivisions of a\r\nmillimeter. The stage micrometer is placed upon the stage of the\r\nmicroscope and brought into focus. From the number of divisions of the\r\neye-piece scale corresponding to each division of the stage micrometer\r\nthe value of the former in fractions of an inch or millimeter is\r\neasily calculated. The counting slide of the Thoma-Zeiss hemocytometer\r\nwill answer in place of a stage micrometer, the lines which form the\r\nsides of the small squares being one-twentieth of a millimeter apart.\r\nAny eye-piece can be converted into a micrometer eye-piece by placing\r\na micrometer disc--a small circular glass plate with ruled\r\nscale--ruled side down upon its diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe principal microscopic objects which are measured clinically are\r\nanimal parasites and their ova and abnormal blood-corpuscles. The\r\nmetric system is used almost exclusively. For very small objects 0.001\r\nmm. has been adopted as the unit of measurement, under the name\r\n_micron_. It is represented by the Greek letter µ. For larger objects,\r\nwhere exact measurement is not essential, the diameter of a red\r\nblood-corpuscle (7 to 8 µ) is sometimes taken as a unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{24}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SPUTUM\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Considerations.--The morning sputum or the whole amount\r\nfor twenty-four hours should be collected for examination. In\r\nbeginning tuberculosis tubercle bacilli can often be found in that\r\nfirst coughed up in the morning when they cannot be detected at any\r\nother time of day. Sometimes, in these early cases, there are only a\r\nfew mucopurulent flakes which contain the bacilli, or only a small\r\npurulent mass every few days, and these may easily be overlooked.\r\n\r\nAs a receptacle for the sputum a clean wide-mouthed bottle with\r\ntightly fitting cork may be used. The patient must be particularly\r\ncautioned against smearing any of it upon the outside of the bottle.\r\nThis is probably the chief source of danger to those who examine\r\nsputum.\r\n\r\nWhen the examination is begun, the sputum should be spread out in a\r\nthin layer in a Petri dish, or, better, between two small plates of\r\nglass, like photographic plates. It may then be examined with the\r\nnaked eye--best over a black background--or with a low power of the\r\nmicroscope. The portions most suitable for further examination may\r\nthus be easily selected.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination the sputum must be destroyed by heat or\r\nchemicals, and everything which has come in contact with it must be\r\nsterilized. The utmost care must be taken not to allow any of it to\r\ndry and become disseminated through the air.\r\n\r\nExamination of the sputum is most conveniently {25} considered under\r\nthree heads: I. Physical examination. II. Microscopic examination.\r\nIII. Characteristics of the sputum in various diseases. Chemic\r\nexamination yields nothing of clinical importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n1. Quantity.--The quantity expectorated in twenty-four hours varies\r\ngreatly: it may be so slight as to be overlooked entirely in beginning\r\ntuberculosis; and it may be as much as 1000 c.c. in bronchiectasis.\r\n\r\n2. Color.--Since the sputum ordinarily consists of varying proportions\r\nof mucus and pus, it may vary from a colorless, translucent mucus to\r\nan opaque, whitish or yellow, purulent mass. A yellowish-green is\r\nfrequently seen in advanced phthisis.\r\n\r\nA red color usually indicates the presence of blood. Bright red blood,\r\nmost commonly in streaks, is strongly suggestive of phthisis. It may\r\nbe noted very early in the disease. A rusty red sputum is the rule in\r\ncroupous pneumonia, and was at one time considered pathognomonic of\r\nthe disease. \"Prune-juice\" sputum is said to be characteristic of\r\n\"drunkard's pneumonia.\" A brown color, due to altered blood-pigment,\r\nfollows hemorrhages from the lungs.\r\n\r\nGray or black sputum is observed among those who work much in\r\ncoal-dust, and is occasionally seen in smokers who \"inhale.\"\r\n\r\n3. Consistence.--According to their consistence, sputa are usually\r\nclassified as serous, mucoid, purulent, seropurulent, mucopurulent,\r\netc., which names explain themselves. As a rule, the more mucus and\r\nthe less pus and serum a sputum contains, the more tenacious it is.\r\n\r\n{26} The rusty sputum of croupous pneumonia is extremely tenacious, so\r\nthat the vessel in which it is contained may be inverted without\r\nspilling it. The same is true of the almost purely mucoid sputum\r\n(\"sputum crudum\") of beginning acute bronchitis, and of that which\r\nfollows an attack of asthma. A purely serous sputum is fairly\r\ncharacteristic of edema of the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nThe portions most likely to contain structures of interest should be\r\nvery carefully selected, as already described. _The few minutes spent\r\nin this preliminary examination will sometimes save hours of work\r\nlater._ Opaque, white or yellow particles are frequently bits of food,\r\nbut may be cheesy masses from the tonsils; small cheesy nodules,\r\nderived from tuberculous cavities and containing many tubercle bacilli\r\nand elastic fibers; Curschmann's spirals, or small fibrinous casts,\r\ncoiled into little balls; or shreds of mucus with great numbers of\r\nentangled pus-corpuscles.\r\n\r\nThe sputum should always be examined, both unstained and stained.\r\n\r\nA. UNSTAINED SPUTUM\r\n\r\nThe particle selected for examination should be transferred to a clean\r\nslide, covered with a clean cover-glass, and examined with the\r\ntwo-thirds objective, followed by the one-sixth. It is convenient to\r\nhandle the bits of sputum with a wooden toothpick, which may be burned\r\nwhen done with. The platinum wire used in bacteriologic work is less\r\nsatisfactory because not usually stiff enough.\r\n\r\nThe more important structures to be seen in unstained sputum are:\r\nelastic fibers, Curschmann's spirals, {27} Charcot-Leyden crystals,\r\nfibrinous casts, the ray fungus of actinomycosis, and molds. Pigmented\r\ncells, especially the so-called \"heart-failure cells\" (p. 43), are\r\nalso best studied without staining (Plate II, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Elastic fibers from the sputum: _a_, Highly\r\nmagnified; _b_, alveolar arrangement, less highly magnified (after\r\nBizzozero).]\r\n\r\n1. Elastic Fibers.--These are the elastic fibers of the pulmonary\r\nsubstance (Fig. 4). When found in the sputum, they always indicate\r\ndestructive disease of the lungs, provided they do not come from the\r\nfood, which is a not infrequent source. They are found most commonly\r\nin phthisis: rarely in other diseases. Advanced cases of tuberculosis\r\noften show great numbers, and, rarely, they may be found in early\r\ntuberculosis when the bacilli cannot be detected. In gangrene of the\r\nlung, where they would be expected, they are frequently not found,\r\nowing, probably, to the presence of a ferment which destroys them.\r\n\r\n{28} The fibers should be searched for with a two-thirds objective,\r\nalthough a one-sixth is needed to identify them with certainty. Under\r\nthe one-sixth they appear as slender, highly refractive fibers with\r\ndouble contour and, often, curled or split ends. Frequently they are\r\nfound in alveolar arrangement, retaining the original outline of the\r\nalveoli of the lung (Fig. 4, _b_). _Leptothrix buccalis_, which is a\r\nnormal inhabitant of the mouth, may easily be mistaken for elastic\r\ntissue. It can be distinguished by running a little iodin solution\r\nunder the cover-glass (see p. 37).\r\n\r\nTo find elastic fibers when not abundant boil the sputum with a 10 per\r\ncent. solution of caustic soda until it becomes fluid, add several\r\ntimes its bulk of water, and centrifugalize, or allow to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours in a conical glass. Examine the sediment\r\nmicroscopically. {29} The fibers will be pale and swollen. Too long\r\nboiling will destroy them entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Curschmann's spirals: I., Natural size; II.\r\nand III., enlarged: _a_, central fiber (after Curschmann).]\r\n\r\n2. Curschmann's Spirals.--These peculiar structures are found most\r\nfrequently in bronchial asthma, of which they are fairly\r\ncharacteristic. They may occasionally be met with in chronic\r\nbronchitis and other conditions. Their nature has not been definitely\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nMacroscopically, they are whitish or yellow, twisted threads,\r\nfrequently coiled into little balls (Fig. 5, I.). Their length is\r\nrarely over half an inch, though it sometimes exceeds two inches.\r\nUnder a two-thirds objective they appear as mucous threads having a\r\nclear central fiber, about which are wound many fine fibrils (Fig. 5,\r\nII. and III.). Leukocytes are usually present within them, and\r\nsometimes Charcot-Leyden crystals. The central fiber is not always\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Charcot-Leyden crystals (after Riegel).]\r\n\r\n{30} 3. Charcot-Leyden Crystals.--Of the crystals which may be found\r\nin the sputum, the most interesting are the Charcot-Leyden crystals.\r\nThey are rarely found except in cases of bronchial asthma, and were at\r\none time thought to be the cause of the disease. They frequently\r\nadhere to Curschmann spirals. Their exact nature is unknown.\r\n\r\nThey are colorless, pointed, often needle-like, octahedral crystals\r\n(Fig. 6). Their size varies greatly, the average length being about\r\nthree or four times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.\r\n\r\nOther crystals--hematoidin, cholesterin, and, most frequently, fat\r\nneedles--are common in sputum which has remained in the body for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Fibrinous bronchial cast (Sahli).]\r\n\r\n4. Fibrinous Casts.--These are fibrinous molds of the smaller bronchi.\r\nTheir size varies with that of the bronchi in which they are formed.\r\nThey may, rarely, {31} be three or more inches in length. When large,\r\nthey can be recognized with the naked eye by floating them out in\r\nwater; when small, a low power of the microscope must be used. They\r\nare easily recognized from their branching, tree-like structure (Fig.\r\n7).\r\n\r\nFibrinous casts are characteristic of fibrinous bronchitis, but may\r\nalso be found in diphtheria of the smaller bronchi. Very small casts\r\nare often seen in croupous pneumonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Sputum from a case of actinomycosis; stained\r\n(Jakob).]\r\n\r\n5. Actinomyces Bovis (Ray-fungus).--In the sputum of pulmonary\r\nactinomycosis and in the pus from actinomycotic lesions elsewhere\r\nsmall, yellowish, \"sulphur\" granules can be detected with the unaided\r\neye. The fungus can be seen by crushing one of these granules between\r\nslide and cover, and examining with a low power. It consists of a\r\nnetwork of threads having a more or less radial arrangement, those at\r\nthe periphery presenting club-shaped extremities (Fig. 8). This\r\norganism, also called _Streptothrix actinomyces_, apparently stands\r\nmidway between the bacteria and the molds. It stains by Gram's method.\r\n\r\n{32} Actinomycosis of the lung is rare. The clinical picture is that\r\nof tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n6. Molds.--The hyphæ and spores of various molds are occasionally met\r\nwith in the sputum. They are usually the result of contamination, and\r\nhave little significance. The hyphæ are rods, usually jointed or\r\nbranched (Fig. 58), and often arranged in a meshwork (mycelium); the\r\nspores are highly refractive spheres. Both stain well with the\r\nordinary stains.\r\n\r\nB. STAINED SPUTUM\r\n\r\nStructures which are best seen in stained sputum are bacteria and\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n1. Bacteria.--Only those of some clinical importance will be\r\nconsidered. They are: tubercle bacilli; staphylococci and\r\nstreptococci; pneumococci; bacilli of Friedländer; and influenza\r\nbacilli.\r\n\r\n(1) Tubercle Bacillus.--The presence of the tubercle bacillus may be\r\ntaken as positive evidence of the existence of tuberculosis somewhere\r\nalong the respiratory tract, most likely in the lung. In laryngeal\r\ntuberculosis they are not easily found in the sputum, but can nearly\r\nalways be detected in swabs made directly from the larynx.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the tubercle bacillus depends upon the fact that it\r\nstains with difficulty; but that when once stained, it retains the\r\nstain tenaciously, even when treated with a mineral acid, which\r\nquickly removes the stain from other bacteria. The most convenient\r\nmethod for general purposes is here given in detail:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGabbet's Method.--(1) Spread suspicious particles thinly and evenly\r\nupon a slide or a cover-glass held in the grasp of {33} cover-glass\r\nforceps. Cover-glasses are easier to handle while staining. Do not\r\ngrasp a cover too near the edge or the stain will not stay on it well.\r\nTenacious sputum will spread better if gently warmed while spreading.\r\n\r\n(2) Dry the film in the air.\r\n\r\n(3) Fix in a flame; _i.e._, pass the cover-glass rather slowly, with\r\nfilm side up, three times (a slide about twelve times) through the\r\nflame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol lamp. Take care not to scorch.\r\nShould the film be washed off during future manipulations, fixation\r\nhas been insufficient.\r\n\r\n(4) Apply as much carbol-fuchsin as will stay on, and hold over a\r\nflame so that it will steam for three minutes or longer, replacing the\r\nstain as it evaporates. If the bacilli are well stained in this step,\r\nthere will be little danger of decolorizing them later.\r\n\r\n(5) Wash the film in water.\r\n\r\n(6) Apply Gabbet's stain to the under side of the cover-glass to\r\nremove excess of carbol-fuchsin, and then to the film side. Allow this\r\nto act for one-fourth to one-half minute.\r\n\r\n(7) Wash in water.\r\n\r\n(8) If, now, the thinner portions of the film are blue, proceed to the\r\nnext step; if they are still red, repeat steps (6) and (7) until the\r\nred has disappeared. Too long application of Gabbet's stain will\r\ndecolorize the tubercle bacilli.\r\n\r\n(9) Place the preparation between layers of filter-paper and dry by\r\nrubbing with the fingers, as one would in blotting ink.\r\n\r\n(10) Put a drop of Canada balsam upon a clean slide, place the\r\ncover-glass film side down upon it, and examine with a one-twelfth\r\nobjective. Cedar oil or water may be used in place of balsam for\r\ntemporary preparations. Smears on slides may be examined directly with\r\nan oil-immersion lens, no cover being necessary.\r\n\r\n_Carbol-fuchsin_ is prepared by mixing 10 c.c. of a saturated\r\nalcoholic solution of fuchsin with 90 c.c. of 5 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of phenol.\r\n\r\n{34} _Gabbet's stain_ consists of methylene-blue, 2 gm.; 25 per cent.\r\nsulphuric acid, 100 c.c.\r\n\r\nBoth stains can be purchased ready prepared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn films stained by Gabbet's method tubercle bacilli, if present, will\r\nbe seen as slender red rods upon a blue background of mucus and cells\r\n(Plate II, Fig. 2). They average 3 to 4 µ in length--about one-half\r\nthe diameter of a red blood-corpuscle. Beginners must be warned\r\nagainst mistaking the edges of cells, or particles which have retained\r\nthe red stain, for bacilli. The appearance of the bacilli is almost\r\nalways typical, and if there seems room for doubt, the structure in\r\nquestion is probably not a tubercle bacillus. They may lie singly or\r\nin groups. They are very frequently bent and often have a beaded\r\nappearance. It is possible that the larger, beaded bacilli indicate a\r\nless active tuberculous process than do the smaller, uniformly stained\r\nones. Sometimes they are present in great numbers--thousands in a\r\nfield of the one-twelfth objective. Sometimes several cover-glasses\r\nmust be examined to find a single bacillus. At times they are so few\r\nthat none are found in stained smears, and special methods are\r\nrequired to detect them. The number may bear some relation to the\r\nseverity of the disease, but this relation is by no means constant.\r\nThe mucoid sputum from an incipient case sometimes contains great\r\nnumbers, while sputum from large tuberculous cavities at times\r\ncontains very few. Failure to find them is not conclusive, though\r\ntheir absence is much more significant when the sputum is purulent\r\nthan when it is mucoid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. Fig. 1.--Heart-failure cells in sputum,\r\ncontaining blood-pigment, from a case of cardiac congestion of the\r\nlungs (Jakob).\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--_A_, Sputum showing tubercle bacilli stained with\r\ncarbol-fuchsin and Gabbet's methylene-blue solution (obj. one-twelfth\r\noil-immersion); _B_, sputum of anthracosis, showing particles of\r\ncoal-dust stained with methylene-blue (obj. one-twelfth oil-immersion)\r\n(Boston).]\r\n\r\nWhen they are not found in suspicious cases, one of the following\r\nmethods should be tried:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Take a few drams of the sputum in a test-tube, add hot {35} water,\r\nand heat until the albumin is coagulated. Let settle for twenty-four\r\nhours, or centrifugalize at once, and examine the sediment for\r\ntubercle bacilli.\r\n\r\n(2) Boil the sputum with just sufficient weak caustic soda solution to\r\nrender it fluid; neutralize with acetic acid; add several times its\r\nvolume of water; centrifugalize; and stain the sediment, adding a\r\nlittle of the untreated sputum to make the smear adhere to the\r\ncover-glass.\r\n\r\n(3) Inoculate guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are a number of bacilli, called _acid-fast bacilli_, which stain\r\nin the same way as the tubercle bacillus. Of these, the smegma\r\nbacillus is the only one likely ever to cause confusion. It, or a\r\nsimilar bacillus, is sometimes found in the sputum of gangrene of the\r\nlung. It occurs normally about the glans penis and the clitoris, and\r\nis often present in the urine. The method of distinguishing it from\r\nthe tubercle bacillus is given later (p. 127).\r\n\r\nOther bacteria than the acid-fast group are stained blue by Gabbet's\r\nmethod. Those most commonly found are staphylococci, streptococci, and\r\npneumococci. Their presence in company with the tubercle bacillus\r\nconstitutes _mixed infection_, which is much more serious than single\r\ninfection by the tubercle bacillus. It is to be remembered, however,\r\nthat a few of these bacteria may reach the sputum from the upper\r\nair-passages. Clinically, mixed infection is evidenced by fever.\r\n\r\n(2) Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (p. 262).--One or both of these\r\norganisms is commonly present in company with the tubercle bacillus in\r\nthe sputum of advanced phthisis (Plate II, Fig. 2). They are often\r\nfound in bronchitis, catarrhal pneumonia, and many other conditions.\r\n\r\n(3) Pneumococcus (Diplococcus of Fränkel).--The pneumococcus is the\r\ncausative agent in nearly all cases {36} of croupous pneumonia, and is\r\ncommonly found in large numbers in the rusty sputum of this disease.\r\nIt is sometimes met with in the sputum of catarrhal pneumonia,\r\nbronchitis, and tuberculosis. It has been found in the saliva in\r\nhealth. Pneumococci are about the size of streptococci. They are ovoid\r\nin shape, and lie in pairs, end to end, often forming short chains.\r\nEach is surrounded by a gelatinous capsule, which is its distinctive\r\nfeature (Fig. 9). Diplococci without capsules are common in the\r\nsputum, but have no special significance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diplococcus pneumoniæ in the blood (Fränkel\r\nand Pfeiffer).]\r\n\r\nRecognition of the pneumococcus depends upon its morphology, the fact\r\nthat it is Gram-staining, and the presence of a capsule. Numerous\r\nmethods for staining capsules have been devised, but few are\r\nsatisfactory. Buerger's method is excellent. It is especially useful\r\nwith cultures upon serum media, but is applicable also to the sputum.\r\nSmith's method usually gives good results, as does also the more\r\nsimple method of Hiss (p. 263). The sputum should be fresh--not more\r\nthan three or four hours' old.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{37} Buerger's Method for Capsules.--(1) Mix a few drops each of the\r\nsputum and blood-serum on egg-albumin solution (egg-albumin, distilled\r\nwater, equal parts; shake and filter through cotton). Make thin smears\r\nfrom the mixture and just as the edges begin to dry, cover with\r\nMüller's fluid (potassium bichromate, 2.5 gm.; sodium sulphate, 1.0\r\ngm.; water 100 c.c.) saturated with mercuric chlorid (ordinarily about\r\n5 per cent.). Gently warm over a flame for about three seconds. This\r\nrapidly fixes the bacteria while still living.\r\n\r\n(2) Rinse very quickly in water.\r\n\r\n(3) Flush once with alcohol.\r\n\r\n(4) Apply tincture of iodin for one to two minutes.\r\n\r\n(5) Thoroughly wash off the iodin with alcohol and dry in the air.\r\n\r\n(6) Stain about three seconds with weak anilin-gentian-violet freshly\r\nmade up as follows: Anilin oil, 10; water, 100; shake; filter; and add\r\n5 c.c. of a saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet.\r\n\r\n(7) Rinse off the stain with 2 per cent. solution of sodium chlorid,\r\nmount in this solution, and examine with a one-twelfth objective.\r\n\r\nBuerger suggests a very useful variation as follows: After the alcohol\r\nwash and drying, the specimen is stained by Gram's method (p. 39),\r\ncounter-stained with aqueous solution of fuchsin, washed, and mounted\r\nin water. The pneumococcus holds the purple stain, while all capsules\r\ntake on the pink counter-stain.\r\n\r\nSmith's Method.--This somewhat complicated, but not difficult, method\r\nis very useful as a routine stain for the sputum. It brings out well\r\nall cells and all bacteria except the tubercle bacillus.\r\n\r\n(1) Make thin smears, dry, and fix in a flame in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n(2) Apply anilin-gentian-violet a few seconds, gently warming until\r\nsteam rises.\r\n\r\n(3) Rinse in water.\r\n\r\n(4) Apply Gram's iodin solution for thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n{38} (5) Wash in 95 per cent. alcohol until the purple color ceases to\r\ncome off.\r\n\r\n(6) Wash with equal parts of ether and absolute alcohol, or with ether\r\nand absolute alcohol successively.\r\n\r\n(7) Apply a saturated aqueous solution of eosin for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n(8) Rinse off the eosin with Löffler's methylene-blue, then cover with\r\nthe methylene-blue, and heat until steam rises.\r\n\r\n(9) Wash in water.\r\n\r\n(10) Rinse quickly with absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n(11) Apply xylol a half minute or longer.\r\n\r\n(12) Mount in balsam.\r\n\r\nBy this method organisms which stain by Gram's method (staphylococci,\r\nstreptococci, pneumococci, etc.) are purplish-black; organisms which\r\ndecolorize by Gram's method (bacilli of Friedländer, influenza\r\nbacilli, etc.) are blue; capsules are pink; nuclei of all cells are\r\nblue; and granules of eosinophilic cells are bright red.\r\n\r\n_Anilin-gentian-violet_.--Ehrlich's formula is the one generally used,\r\nbut this keeps only a few weeks. Stirling's solution, which keeps much\r\nbetter and seems to give equal results, is as follows: gentian-violet,\r\n5 gm.; alcohol, 10 c.c.; anilin oil, 2 c.c.; water, 88 c.c.\r\n\r\n_Gram's Iodin Solution_.--Iodin, 1 gm.; potassium iodid, 2 gm.; water,\r\n300 c.c.\r\n\r\n_Löffler's alkaline methylene-blue_ is a very generally useful stain\r\nfor bacteria. It is composed of 30 parts of a saturated alcoholic\r\nsolution of methylene-blue and 100 parts of a 1:10,000 aqueous\r\nsolution of caustic potash. It keeps indefinitely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(4) Bacillus of Friedländer (Bacillus mucosus capsulatus).--In a small\r\npercentage of cases of pneumonia, this organism is found alone or in\r\ncompany with the pneumococcus. Its pathologic significance is\r\nuncertain. It is often present in the respiratory tract under normal\r\nconditions. Friedländer's bacilli are non-motile, {39} encapsulated\r\nrods, sometimes arranged in short chains (Fig. 10). Very short\r\nindividuals in pairs closely resemble pneumococci, from which they are\r\ndistinguished by the fact that they are Gram-decolorizing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Friedländer's bacillus in pus from pulmonary\r\nabscess (obj. one-twelfth) (Boston).]\r\n\r\n(5) Bacillus of Influenza.--This is the etiologic factor in true\r\ninfluenza. It is present, often in large numbers, in the nasal and\r\nbronchial secretions, and is also found in the local lesions following\r\ninfluenza. Chronic infection by influenza bacilli may be mistaken\r\nclinically for tuberculosis, and they should be searched for in all\r\ncases of obstinate chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nTheir recognition depends upon the facts that they are extremely small\r\nbacilli; that most of them lie within the pus-cells; that their ends\r\nstain more deeply than their centers, sometimes giving the appearance\r\nof minute diplococci; and that they are decolorized by Gram's method\r\nof staining (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nThey are stained blue in Gabbet's method for tubercle bacilli, but are\r\nmore certainly recognized by Smith's method or by Gram's method,\r\nfollowed by Bismarck brown or fuchsin, as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGram's Method.--(1) Make smears, dry und fix by heat.\r\n\r\n(2) Apply anilin-gentian-violet two to five minutes.\r\n\r\n(3) Wash with water.\r\n\r\n(4) Apply Gram's iodin solution one-half to two minutes.\r\n\r\n(5) Wash in alcohol until the purple color ceases to come off.\r\n\r\n(6) Apply a saturated aqueous or alcoholic solution of Bismarck brown\r\none-half to one minute, or a weak solution of fuchsin until the film\r\nbecome pink. The latter {40} probably gives a better contrast stain,\r\nbut there is danger of overstaining.\r\n\r\n(7) Wash in water, dry, and mount.\r\n\r\nBy this method Gram-staining bacteria are purple; Gram-decolorizing\r\nbacteria and nuclei of cells are brown or red.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Bacillus of influenza; cover-glass\r\npreparation of sputum from a case of influenza, showing the bacilli in\r\nleukocytes; highly magnified (Pfeiffer).]\r\n\r\n2. Cells.--These include pus-corpuscles, epithelial cells, and red\r\nblood-corpuscles.\r\n\r\n(1) Pus-corpuscles are present in every sputum, and at times the\r\nsputum may consist of little else. They are the polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytes of the blood, and appear as rounded cells with several\r\nnuclei or one very irregular nucleus (Fig. 8 and Plate II, Fig. 2).\r\nThey are frequently filled with granules of coal-dust and are often\r\nmuch degenerated. Such coal-dust-laden leukocytes are especially\r\nabundant in anthracosis, where angular black particles, both intra-\r\nand extra-cellular, are often so numerous as to color the sputum\r\n(Plate II, Fig. 2, _B_). Occasionally mononuclear leukocytes are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n{41} _Eosinophilic leukocytes_ are quite constantly found in large\r\nnumbers in the sputum of bronchial asthma near the time of the\r\nparoxysm, and constitute one of the most distinctive features of the\r\nsputum of this disease. They resemble ordinary pus-corpuscles, except\r\nthat their cytoplasm is filled with coarse granules having a marked\r\naffinity for eosin. Large numbers of free granules, derived from\r\ndisintegrated cells, are also found (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Sputum from a case of asthma showing\r\nleukocytes, some containing eosinophilic granules; free eosinophilic\r\ngranules; and micrococci; stained with eosin and methylene-blue\r\n(Jakob).]\r\n\r\nOrdinary pus-cells are easily recognized in sputum stained by any of\r\nthe methods already given. For eosinophilic cells, some method which\r\nincludes eosin must be used. A simple method is to stain the dried and\r\nfixed film two or three minutes with saturated solution of eosin, and\r\nthen one-half to one minute with Löffler's methylene-blue; nuclei and\r\nbacteria will be blue, eosinophilic granules bright red.\r\n\r\n(2) Epithelial cells may come from any part of the {42} respiratory\r\ntract. A few are always present. They have little diagnostic value,\r\nalthough a considerable excess would indicate a pathologic condition\r\nat the site of their origin. Any of the stains mentioned above will\r\nshow them, and they can usually be identified in unstained sputum. In\r\ngeneral three forms are found:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Squamous cells_: large, flat, polygonal cells with a\r\ncomparatively small nucleus (Fig. 13, _i_). They come from the upper\r\nair-passages, and are especially numerous in laryngitis and\r\npharyngitis. They are frequently studded with bacteria--most commonly\r\ndiplococci.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Different morphologic elements of the sputum\r\n(unstained): _a_, _b_, _c_, Pulmonary or alveolar epithelium--_a_,\r\nwith normal lung pigment (carbon); _b_, with fat-droplets; _c_, with\r\nmyelin globules; _d_, pus-corpuscles; _e_, red blood-corpuscles; _f_,\r\ncylindric beaker-shaped bronchial cells; _g_, free myelin globules;\r\n_h_, ciliated epithelium of different kinds from the nose, altered by\r\ncoryza; _i_, squamous cells from the pharynx (after Bizzozero).]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Cylindric cells_ from the nose, trachea, and bronchi (Fig. 13,\r\n_f_, _h_): These are not usually abundant, and, {43} as a rule, they\r\nare not identified because much altered from their original form,\r\nbeing often spheric.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Alveolar cells_: rather large, round, or oval cells with one or\r\ntwo round nuclei (Fig. 13). Their source is presumably the pulmonary\r\nalveoli. Like the leukocytes, they frequently contain particles of\r\ncarbon (normal lung pigment). In chronic heart disease, owing to\r\nlong-continued passive congestion, they may be filled with brown\r\ngranules of altered blood-pigment, and are then called \"heart-failure\r\ncells\" (Plate II, Fig. 1). Alveolar cells commonly contain\r\nfat-droplets and, less frequently, myelin globules. The latter are\r\ncolorless, rounded bodies, sometimes resembling fat droplets, but\r\noften showing concentric or irregularly spiral markings (Fig. 13, _c_,\r\n_g_). They are also found free in the sputum. They are abundant in the\r\nscanty morning sputum of apparently healthy persons, but may be\r\npresent in any mucoid sputum.\r\n\r\n(3) Red blood-corpuscles may be present in small numbers in almost any\r\nsputum. When fairly constantly present in considerable numbers, they\r\nare suggestive of phthisis. The corpuscles when fresh are shown by any\r\nof the staining methods which include eosin. They are commonly so much\r\ndegenerated as to be unrecognizable, and often only altered\r\nblood-pigment is left. Ordinarily, blood in the sputum is sufficiently\r\nrecognized with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SPUTA IN DISEASE\r\n\r\nOnly those conditions which give fairly characteristic sputa are\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n1. Acute Bronchitis.--There is at first a small amount of tenacious,\r\nalmost purely mucoid sputum, frequently blood-streaked. This gradually\r\nbecomes more abundant, {44} mucopurulent in character, and yellowish\r\nor gray in color. At first the microscope shows a few leukocytes and\r\nalveolar and bronchial cells; later, the leukocytes become more\r\nnumerous. Bacteria are not usually abundant.\r\n\r\n2. Chronic Bronchitis.--The sputum is usually abundant, mucopurulent,\r\nand yellowish or yellowish-green in color. Nummular masses--circular,\r\n\"coin-like\" discs which sink in water--may be seen. Microscopically,\r\nthere are great numbers of leukocytes, often much degenerated.\r\nEpithelium is not abundant. Bacteria of various kinds, especially\r\nstaphylococci, are usually numerous.\r\n\r\nIn fibrinous bronchitis there are found, in addition, fibrinous casts,\r\nusually of medium size.\r\n\r\nIn the chronic bronchitis accompanying long-continued passive\r\ncongestion of the lungs, as in poorly compensated heart disease, the\r\nsputum may assume a rusty brown color, owing to presence of large\r\nnumbers of the \"heart-failure cells\" previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n3. Bronchiectasis.--The sputum is very abundant at intervals,\r\nsometimes as high as a liter in twenty-four hours, and has a very\r\noffensive odor when the cavity is large. It is thinner than that of\r\nchronic bronchitis, and upon standing separates into three layers of\r\npus, mucus, and frothy serum. It contains great numbers of\r\nmiscellaneous bacteria.\r\n\r\n4. Gangrene of the Lung.--The sputum is abundant, fluid, very\r\noffensive, and brownish in color. It separates into three layers upon\r\nstanding--a brown deposit, a clear fluid, and a frothy layer.\r\nMicroscopically, few cells of any kind are found. Bacteria are\r\nextremely numerous; among them may sometimes be found an acid-fast\r\nbacillus probably identical with the smegma bacillus. As before {45}\r\nstated, elastic fibers are less common than would be expected.\r\n\r\n5. Pulmonary Edema.--Here there is an abundant, watery, frothy sputum,\r\nvarying from faintly yellow or pink to dark-brown in color; a few\r\nleukocytes and epithelial cells and varying numbers of red\r\nblood-corpuscles are found with the microscope.\r\n\r\n6. Bronchial Asthma.--The sputum during and following an attack is\r\nscanty and very tenacious. Most characteristic is the presence of\r\nCurschmann's spirals, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and eosinophilic\r\nleukocytes.\r\n\r\n7. Croupous Pneumonia.--Characteristic of this disease is a scanty,\r\nrusty red, very tenacious sputum containing red corpuscles or altered\r\nblood-pigment, leukocytes, epithelial cells, usually many pneumococci,\r\nand often very small fibrinous casts. This sputum is seen during the\r\nstage of red hepatization. During resolution the sputum assumes the\r\nappearance of that of chronic bronchitis. When pneumonia occurs during\r\nthe course of a chronic bronchitis, the characteristic rusty red\r\nsputum may not appear.\r\n\r\n8. Pulmonary Tuberculosis.--The sputum is variable. In the earliest\r\nstages it may be scanty and almost purely mucoid, with an occasional\r\nyellow flake, or there may be only a very small mucopurulent mass.\r\nWhen the quantity is very small there may be no cough, the sputum\r\nreaching the larynx by action of the bronchial cilia. This is not well\r\nenough recognized by practitioners. A careful inspection of all the\r\nsputum brought up by the patient on several successive days, and a\r\nmicroscopic examination of all yellow portions, will not infrequently\r\nestablish a diagnosis of tuberculosis when physical signs are\r\nnegative. {46} Tubercle bacilli will sometimes be found in large\r\nnumbers at this stage. Blood-streaked sputum is strongly suggestive of\r\ntuberculosis, and is more common in the early stages than later.\r\n\r\nThe sputum of more advanced cases resembles that of chronic\r\nbronchitis, with the addition of tubercle bacilli and elastic fibers.\r\nCaseous particles containing immense numbers of the bacilli are\r\ncommon. Far-advanced cases with large cavities often show rather firm,\r\nspheric or ovoid masses of thick pus in a thin fluid--the so-called\r\n\"globular sputum.\" These globular masses usually contain many tubercle\r\nbacilli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{47}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE URINE\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Considerations.--The urine is an aqueous solution of\r\nvarious organic and inorganic substances. It is probably both a\r\nsecretion and an excretion. Most of the substances in solution are\r\neither waste-products from the body metabolism or products derived\r\ndirectly from the foods eaten. Normally, the total amount of solid\r\nconstituents carried off in twenty-four hours is about 60 gm., of\r\nwhich the organic substances make up about 35 gm. and the inorganic\r\nabout 25 gm.\r\n\r\nThe chief organic constituents are urea and uric acid. Urea\r\nconstitutes about one-half of all the solids, or about 30 gm. in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe chief inorganic constituents are the chlorids, phosphates, and\r\nsulphates. The chlorids, practically all in the form of sodium\r\nchlorid, constitute one-half, or about 13 gm., in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCertain substances appear in the urine only in pathologic conditions.\r\nThe most important of these are proteids, sugars, acetone and related\r\nsubstances, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the substances in solution all urines contain various\r\nmicroscopic structures.\r\n\r\nWhile, under ordinary conditions, the composition of urine does not\r\nvary much from day to day, it varies greatly at different hours of the\r\nsame day. It is evident, {48} therefore, that _no quantitative test\r\ncan be of value unless a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be\r\nused_. The patient should be instructed to void all the urine during\r\nthe twenty-four hours into a clean vessel kept in a cool place, to mix\r\nit well, to measure the whole quantity, and to bring four to eight\r\nounces for examination. When it is desired to make only qualitative\r\ntests, as for albumin or sugar, a \"sample\" voided at random will\r\nanswer. It should be remembered, however, that urine passed about\r\nthree hours after a meal is most likely to contain pathologic\r\nsubstances. That voided first in the morning is least likely to\r\ncontain them.\r\n\r\nThe urine must be examined while fresh. Decomposition sets in rapidly,\r\nespecially in warm weather, and greatly interferes with all the\r\nexaminations. Decomposition may be delayed by adding five grains of\r\nboric acid (as much of the powder as can be heaped upon a ten-cent\r\npiece) for each four ounces of urine. Formalin, in proportion of one\r\ndrop to four ounces, is also an efficient preservative, but if larger\r\namounts be used, it may give reactions for sugar and albumin, and is\r\nlikely to cause a precipitate which greatly interferes with the\r\nmicroscopic examination.\r\n\r\nNormal and abnormal pigments, which interfere with certain of the\r\ntests, can be removed by filtering the urine through animal charcoal,\r\nor precipitating with a solution of acetate of lead and filtering.\r\n\r\nA suspected fluid can be identified as urine by detecting any\r\nconsiderable quantity of urea in it (p. 66). Traces of urea may,\r\nhowever, be met with in ovarian cyst fluid, while urine from very old\r\ncases of hydronephrosis may contain little or none.\r\n\r\n{49} Clinical examination of the urine may conveniently be considered\r\nunder four heads: I. Physical examination. II. Chemic examination.\r\nIII. Microscopic examination. IV. The urine in disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n1. Quantity.--The quantity passed in twenty-four hours varies greatly\r\nwith the amount of liquids ingested, perspiration, etc. The normal may\r\nbe taken as 1000 to 1500 c.c., or 40 to 50 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe quantity is increased (polyuria) during absorption of large serous\r\neffusions and in many nervous conditions. It is usually much increased\r\nin chronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and diabetes\r\nmellitus. In these conditions a permanent increase in amount of urine\r\nis characteristic--a fact of much value in diagnosis. In diabetes\r\nmellitus the urine may, though rarely, reach the enormous amount of 50\r\nliters.\r\n\r\nThe quantity is decreased (oliguria) in severe diarrhea; in fevers; in\r\nall conditions which interfere with circulation in the kidney, as\r\npoorly compensated heart disease; and in the parenchymatous forms of\r\nnephritis. In uremia the urine is usually very greatly decreased and\r\nmay be entirely suppressed (anuria).\r\n\r\n2. Color.--This varies considerably in health, and depends largely\r\nupon the quantity of urine voided. The usual color is yellow or\r\nreddish-yellow, due to the presence of several pigments, chiefly\r\nurochrome. In recording the color Vogel's scale (see _Frontispiece_)\r\nis very widely used, the urine being filtered and examined by\r\ntransmitted light in a glass three or four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe color is sometimes greatly changed by abnormal {50} pigments.\r\nBlood-pigment gives a red or brown, smoky color. Urine containing bile\r\nis yellowish or brown, with a yellow foam when shaken. It may assume a\r\ngreenish hue after standing, owing to oxidation of bilirubin into\r\nbiliverdin. Ingestion of small amounts of methylene-blue gives a pale\r\ngreen; large amounts give a marked blue. Santonin produces a yellow;\r\nrhubarb, senna, cascara, and some other cathartics, a brown color;\r\nthese change to red upon addition of an alkali, and if the urine be\r\nalkaline when voided may cause suspicion of hematuria. Thymol gives a\r\nyellowish-green. Following poisoning from phenol and related drugs the\r\nurine may have a normal color when voided, but becomes olive-green to\r\nbrownish-black upon standing. Urine which contains melanin, as\r\nsometimes in melanotic sarcoma and, very rarely, in wasting diseases,\r\nalso becomes brown or black upon long standing.\r\n\r\n3. Transparency.--Freshly passed normal urine is clear. Upon standing,\r\na faint cloud of mucus, leukocytes, and epithelial cells settles to\r\nthe bottom. Abnormal cloudiness is usually due to presence of\r\nphosphates, urates, pus, blood, or bacteria.\r\n\r\n_Amorphous phosphates_ are precipitated in neutral or alkaline urine.\r\nThey form a white cloud and sediment which disappear upon addition of\r\nan acid.\r\n\r\n_Amorphous urates_ are precipitated only in acid urine. They form a\r\nwhite or pink cloud and sediment (\"brick-dust deposit\") which\r\ndisappear upon heating.\r\n\r\n_Pus_ resembles amorphous phosphates to the naked eye. Its nature is\r\neasily recognized with the microscope, or by adding a strong solution\r\nof caustic soda to the sediment, which is thereby transformed into a\r\ngelatinous mass (Donné's test).\r\n\r\n{51} _Blood_ gives a reddish or brown, smoky color, and may be\r\nrecognized with the microscope or by tests for hemoglobin.\r\n\r\n_Bacteria_, when present in great numbers, give a uniform cloud which\r\ncannot be removed by ordinary filtration. They are detected with the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThe cloudiness of decomposing urine is due mainly to precipitation of\r\nphosphates and multiplication of bacteria.\r\n\r\n4. Reaction.--Normally, the mixed twenty-four-hour urine is slightly\r\nacid in reaction, the acidity being due to acid salts, not to free\r\nacids. Individual samples may be slightly alkaline, especially after a\r\nfull meal. The reaction is determined by means of litmus paper.\r\n\r\nAcidity is increased after administration of certain drugs, and\r\nwhenever the urine is concentrated from any cause, as in fevers. A\r\nvery acid urine may cause frequent micturition because of its\r\nirritation. This is often an important factor in the troublesome\r\nenuresis of children.\r\n\r\nThe urine always becomes alkaline upon long standing, owing to\r\ndecomposition of urea with formation of ammonia. If markedly alkaline\r\nwhen voided, it usually indicates such \"ammoniacal decomposition\" in\r\nthe bladder, which is the rule in chronic cystitis, especially that\r\ndue to paralysis or obstruction. Alkalinity due to ammonia (_volatile\r\nalkalinity_) can be distinguished by the fact that litmus paper turned\r\nblue by the urine again becomes red upon gentle heating. _Fixed\r\nalkalinity_ is due to alkaline salts, and is often observed during\r\nfrequent vomiting, after the crisis of pneumonia, in various forms of\r\nanemia, after full meals, and after administration of certain drugs,\r\nespecially salts of vegetable acids.\r\n\r\n5. Specific Gravity.--The normal average is about {52} 1.017 to 1.020.\r\nSamples of urine taken at random may go far above or below these\r\nfigures, hence a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine should\r\nalways be used.\r\n\r\nPathologically, it may vary from 1.001 to 1.060. It is _low_ in\r\nchronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and many\r\nfunctional nervous disorders. It is _high_ in fevers and in\r\nparenchymatous forms of nephritis. In any form of nephritis a sudden\r\nfall without a corresponding increase in quantity of urine may\r\nforetell approaching uremia. It is _highest_ in diabetes mellitus. A\r\nhigh specific gravity when the urine is not highly colored should lead\r\none to suspect this disease. A normal specific gravity does not,\r\nhowever, exclude it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Squibb's urinometer with thermometer and\r\ncylinder.]\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is most conveniently estimated by means of the\r\nurinometer--Squibb's is preferable (Fig. 14). It is standardized for a\r\ntemperature of 77° F., and the urine should be at or near that\r\ntemperature. Care should be taken that the urinometer does not touch\r\nthe side of the tube, and that air-bubbles are removed from the\r\nsurface {53} of the urine. With most instruments the reading is taken\r\nfrom the bottom of the meniscus.\r\n\r\nOne frequently wishes to ascertain the specific gravity of quantities\r\nof fluid too small to float an urinometer. A simple device for this\r\npurpose, which requires only about 3 c.c. and is very satisfactory in\r\nclinical work, has been designed by Saxe (Fig. 15). The urine is\r\nplaced in the bulb at the bottom, the instrument is floated in\r\ndistilled water, and the specific gravity is read off from the scale\r\nupon the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Saxe's urinopyknometer and jar for same.]\r\n\r\n6. Total Solids.--An estimation of the total amount of solids which\r\npass through the kidneys in twenty-four hours is, in practice, one of\r\nthe most useful of urinary {54} examinations. The normal for a man of\r\n150 pounds is about 60 grams, or 950 grains. The principal factors\r\nwhich influence this amount are body weight (except with excessive\r\nfat), diet, exercise, and age, and these should be considered in\r\nmaking an estimation. After about the forty-fifth year it becomes\r\ngradually less; after seventy-five years it is about one-half the\r\namount given.\r\n\r\nIn disease, the amount of solids depends mainly upon the activity of\r\nmetabolism and the ability of the kidneys to excrete. An estimation of\r\nthe solids, therefore, furnishes an important clue to the functional\r\nefficiency of the kidneys. The kidneys bear much the same relation to\r\nthe organism as does the heart: they cause no direct harm so long as\r\nthey are capable of performing the work required of them. When,\r\nhowever, through either organic disease or functional inactivity, they\r\nfail to carry off their proportion of the waste-products of the body,\r\nsome of these products must either be eliminated through other organs,\r\nwhere they cause irritation and disease, or be retained within the\r\nbody, where they act as poisons. The great importance of these poisons\r\nin production of distressing symptoms and even organic disease is not\r\nwell enough recognized by most practitioners. Disappearance of\r\nunpleasant and perplexing symptoms as the urinary solids rise to the\r\nnormal under proper treatment is often most surprising.\r\n\r\nWhen, other factors remaining unchanged, the amount of solids\r\neliminated is considerably above the normal, increased destructive\r\nmetabolism may be inferred.\r\n\r\nThe total solids can be estimated roughly, but accurately enough for\r\nmost clinical purposes, by multiplying the last two figures of the\r\nspecific gravity of the mixed {55} twenty-four-hour urine by the\r\nnumber of ounces voided and to the product adding one-tenth of itself.\r\nThis gives the amount in grains. Häser's method is more widely used\r\nbut is less convenient. The last two figures of the specific gravity\r\nare multiplied by 2.33. The product is then multiplied by the number\r\nof cubic centimeters voided in twenty-four hours and divided by 1000.\r\nThis gives the total solids in grams.\r\n\r\n7. Functional Tests.--Within the past few years much thought has been\r\ndevoted to methods of more accurately ascertaining the functional\r\nefficiency of the kidneys, especially of one kidney when removal of\r\nthe other is under consideration. The most promising of the methods\r\nwhich have been devised are cryoscopy, the methylene-blue test, and\r\nthe phloridzin test. It is doubtful whether, except in experienced\r\nhands, these yield any more information than can be had from an\r\nintelligent consideration of the specific gravity and the\r\ntwenty-four-hour quantity, together with a microscopic examination.\r\nThey are most useful when the urines obtained from separate kidneys by\r\nsegregation or ureteral catheterization are compared. The reader is\r\nreferred to larger works upon urinalysis for details.\r\n\r\n_Cryoscopy_, determination of the freezing-point, depends upon the\r\nprinciple that the freezing-point of a fluid is depressed in\r\nproportion to the number of molecules in solution. To have any value,\r\nthe freezing-point of the urine must be compared with that of the\r\nblood, since it is not so much the number of molecules contained in\r\nthe urine as the number which the kidney has failed to carry off and\r\nhas left in the blood, that indicates its insufficiency.\r\n\r\n{56} In the _methylene-blue test_ of Achard and Castaigne a solution\r\nof methylene-blue is injected intramuscularly, and the time of its\r\nappearance in the urine is noted. Normally, it appears in about thirty\r\nminutes. When delayed, renal \"permeability\" is supposed to be\r\ninterfered with.\r\n\r\nThe _phloridzin test_ consists in the hypodermic injection of a small\r\nquantity of phloridzin. This substance is transformed into glucose by\r\nthe kidneys of healthy persons. In disease, this change is more or\r\nless interfered with, and the amount of glucose recoverable from the\r\nurine is taken as an index of the secretory power of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nIn applying these tests for \"permeability,\" \"secretory ability,\" etc.,\r\none must remember that the conditions are abnormal, and that there is\r\nno evidence that the kidneys will behave with the products of\r\nmetabolism as they do with the substances selected for the tests, and\r\nalso that the tests throw unusual work upon the kidneys, which in some\r\ncases may be harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHEMIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nA. NORMAL CONSTITUENTS\r\n\r\nThe most important are chlorids, phosphates, sulphates including\r\nindican, urea, and uric acid.\r\n\r\n1. Chlorids.--These are derived from the food, and are mainly in the\r\nform of sodium chlorid. The amount excreted normally is 10 to 15 grams\r\nin twenty-four hours. It is much affected by the diet.\r\n\r\nExcretion of chlorids is diminished in nephritis and in fevers,\r\nespecially in pneumonia and inflammations leading to the formation of\r\nlarge exudates. In nephritis the {57} kidneys are less permeable to\r\nthe chlorids, and it is probable that the edema is due largely to an\r\neffort of the body to dilute the chlorids which have been retained. In\r\nfevers the diminution is due largely to decrease of food. In pneumonia\r\nchlorids are constantly very low, and in some cases are absent\r\nentirely. Following the crisis they are increased. In inflammations\r\nleading to formation of large exudates--_e.g._, pleurisy with\r\neffusion--chlorids are diminished, because a considerable amount\r\nbecomes \"locked up\" in the exudate. During absorption chlorids are\r\nliberated and appear in the urine in excessive amounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The Purdy electric centrifuge.]\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Estimation_.--The best method for clinical purposes is\r\nthe centrifugal method.\r\n\r\n{58} _Purdy's Centrifugal Methods_.--As shown by the late Dr. Purdy,\r\nthe centrifuge offers an important means of making quantitative\r\nestimations of a number of substances in the urine. Results are easily\r\nand quickly obtained, and are probably accurate enough for all\r\nclinical purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Water-motor centrifuge.]\r\n\r\nIn general, the methods consist in precipitating the substance to be\r\nestimated in a graduated centrifuge tube, and applying a definite\r\namount of centrifugal force for a definite length of time, after which\r\nthe percentage of precipitate is read off upon the side of the tube.\r\nAlbumin, if present, must be previously removed by boiling and\r\nfiltering. Results are in terms of _bulk of precipitate_, which must\r\nnot be confused with _percentage by weight_. The weight percentage can\r\nbe found by referring to Purdy's tables, given later. In this, as in\r\nall quantitative urine work, percentages mean little in themselves;\r\nthe actual {59} amount eliminated in twenty-four hours should always\r\nbe calculated.\r\n\r\nThe centrifuge should have an arm with radius of 6¾ inches when in\r\nmotion, and should be capable of maintaining a speed of 1500\r\nrevolutions a minute. The electric centrifuge is to be recommended,\r\nalthough good work can be done with a water-power centrifuge, or,\r\nafter a little practice, with the hand centrifuge. A speed indicator\r\nis desirable with electric and water-motor machines, although one can\r\nlearn to estimate the speed by the musical note.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Purdy's tubes for the centrifuge: _a_,\r\nPercentage tube; _b_, sediment tube.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEstimation of Chlorids.--Fill the graduated tube to the 10 c.c. mark\r\nwith urine; add 15 drops strong nitric acid and then silver nitrate\r\nsolution (dram to the ounce) to the 15 c.c. mark. Mix by inverting\r\nseveral times. Let stand a few minutes for a precipitate to form, and\r\nthen revolve in the centrifuge for three minutes at 1200 revolutions a\r\nminute. Each one-tenth cubic centimeter of precipitate equals 1 per\r\ncent. by bulk. The normal is about 10 per cent. This may be converted\r\ninto terms of chlorin or sodium chlorid by means of the table upon\r\npage 60.

Phosphates.--Phosphates are derived largely from the food, only a\r\nsmall proportion resulting from metabolism. The normal daily output of\r\nphosphoric acid is about 2.5 to 3.5 gm.\r\n\r\nThe urinary phosphates are of two kinds: _alkaline_, which make up\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole, and include the {61} phosphates of sodium and\r\npotassium; and _earthy_, which constitute one-third, and include the\r\nphosphates of calcium and magnesium. Earthy phosphates are frequently\r\nthrown out of solution in neutral and alkaline urines, and as\r\n\"amorphous phosphates\" form a very common sediment. This sediment\r\nseldom indicates an excessive excretion of phosphates.\r\n\r\n_Quantitative estimation_ does not furnish much of definite clinical\r\nvalue. The centrifugal method is the most convenient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTABLE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF PHOSPHATES AFTER CENTRIFUGATION\r\n\r\n_Showing bulk-percentages of uranyl phosphate (H[UO_{2}]PO_{4}) and\r\nthe corresponding gravimetric percentages and grains per ounce of\r\nphosphoric acid (P_{2}O_{5}).--(Purdy.)_\r\n\r\n    Bulk-percentage   | Percentage  | Gr.

One-tenth is in\r\ncombination with certain aromatic substances, mostly products of\r\nalbuminous putrefaction in the intestine (conjugate sulphates). Among\r\nthese aromatic substances are indol, phenol, and skatol. By far the\r\nmost important of the conjugate sulphates and representative of the\r\ngroup is potassium indoxyl sulphate.\r\n\r\nPotassium indoxyl sulphate, or indican, is derived from indol. Indol\r\nis absorbed and oxidized into indoxyl, which combines with potassium\r\nand sulphuric acid and is thus excreted. Under normal conditions the\r\namount in the urine is small. It is increased by a meat diet.\r\n\r\nPathologically, an increase of indican always indicates abnormal\r\nalbuminous putrefaction somewhere in the body. It is noted in:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Diseases of the Small Intestine_.--This is by far the most\r\ncommon source. Intestinal obstruction gives the largest amounts of\r\nindican. It is also much increased in intestinal\r\nindigestion--so-called \"biliousness\"; in inflammations, especially in\r\ncholera and typhoid fever; and in paralysis of peristalsis such as\r\noccurs in peritonitis. Simple constipation and diseases of the _large_\r\nintestine alone do not increase the amount of indican.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Diseases of the stomach_ associated with deficient hydrochloric\r\nacid, as chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Diminished hydrochloric\r\nacid favors intestinal putrefaction.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Decomposition of exudates_ anywhere in the body, as in empyema,\r\nbronchiectasis, and large tuberculous cavities.\r\n\r\n{64} _Detection of indican_ depends upon its decomposition and\r\noxidation of the indoxyl set free into indigo-blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObermayer's Method.--In a test-tube take equal parts of the urine and\r\nObermayer's reagent and add a small quantity of chloroform. Mix by\r\ninverting a few times; avoid shaking violently. If indican be present\r\nin excess, the chloroform, which sinks to the bottom, will assume an\r\nindigo-blue color. The depth of color indicates the comparative amount\r\nof indican if the same proportions of urine and reagents are always\r\nused. The indican in normal urine may give a faint blue by this\r\nmethod. Urine of patients taking iodids gives a reddish-violet color,\r\nwhich disappears upon addition of a few drops of strong sodium\r\nhyposulphite solution. Bile-pigments, which interfere with the test,\r\nmust be removed (p. 48).\r\n\r\n_Obermayer's reagent_ consists of strong hydrochloric acid (sp. gr.,\r\n1.19), 1000 parts, and ferric chlorid, 2 parts. This makes a yellow,\r\nfuming liquid which keeps well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n4. Urea.--From the standpoint of physiology urea is the most important\r\nconstituent of the urine. It is the principal waste-product of\r\nmetabolism, and constitutes about one-half of all the solids\r\nexcreted--about 30 gm. in twenty-four hours. It represents 85 to 90\r\nper cent. of the total nitrogen of the urine, and its quantitative\r\nestimation is a simple, though not very accurate, method of\r\nascertaining the state of nitrogenous excretion. Normally, the amount\r\nis greatly influenced by exercise and diet.\r\n\r\nPathologically, urea is increased in fevers, in diabetes, and\r\nespecially during resolution of pneumonia and absorption of large\r\nexudates. Other factors being equal, the amount of urea indicates the\r\nactivity of metabolism. In {65} this connection the relation between\r\nthe amounts of urea and the chlorids is important. The amount of urea\r\nis normally about twice that of the chlorids. If the proportion is\r\nmuch increased above this, increased tissue destruction may be\r\ninferred, since other conditions which increase urea also increase\r\nchlorids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Crystals of nitrate of urea (upper half) and\r\noxalate of urea (lower half) (after Funke).]\r\n\r\nUrea is decreased in diseases of the liver with destruction of liver\r\nsubstance. It may or may not be decreased in nephritis. In the early\r\nstages of chronic nephritis, when diagnosis is difficult, it is\r\nusually normal. In the late stages, when diagnosis is comparatively\r\neasy, it is decreased. Hence estimation of urea is of little help in\r\nthe diagnosis of this disease, especially when, as is so frequently\r\nthe case, a small quantity of urine taken at random is used. When,\r\nhowever, the diagnosis is established, estimations made at frequent\r\nintervals under the same conditions of diet and exercise are of much\r\nvalue, _provided a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be\r\nused_. A steady decline {66} is a very bad prognostic sign, and a\r\nsudden marked diminution is usually a forerunner of uremia.\r\n\r\nThe presence of urea can be shown by allowing a few drops of the fluid\r\nto partially evaporate upon a slide, and adding a small drop of pure\r\ncolorless nitric acid or saturated solution of oxalic acid. Crystals\r\nof urea nitrate or oxalate (Fig. 19) will soon appear and can be\r\nrecognized with the microscope.\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Estimation_.--The hypobromite method, which is generally\r\nused, depends upon the fact that urea is decomposed by sodium\r\nhypobromite with liberation of nitrogen. The amount of urea is\r\ncalculated from the volume of nitrogen set free. The improved Doremus\r\napparatus (Fig. 20) is the most convenient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Doremus Hinds' ureometer.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPour some of the urine into the smaller tube of the apparatus, then\r\nopen the stopcock and quickly close it so as to fill its lumen with\r\nurine. Rinse out the larger tube with water and fill it and the bulb\r\nwith 25 per cent. caustic soda solution. Add to this 1 c.c. of bromin\r\nby means of a medicine-dropper and mix well. This prepares a fresh\r\nsolution of sodium hypobromite with excess of caustic soda, which\r\nserves to absorb the carbon dioxid set free in the decomposition of\r\nurea. When handling bromin, keep an open vessel of ammonia near to\r\nneutralize the irritant fumes.\r\n\r\nPour the urine into the smaller tube, and then turn the stopcock so as\r\nto let as much urine as desired (usually 1 c.c.) run slowly into the\r\nhypobromite solution. When bubbles have ceased to rise, read off the\r\nheight of the fluid in the large {67} tube by the graduations upon its\r\nside. This gives the amount by weight of urea in the urine added, from\r\nwhich the amount excreted in twenty-four hours can easily be\r\ncalculated. If the urine contains much more than the normal amount, it\r\nshould be diluted.\r\n\r\nTo avoid handling pure bromin, which is disagreeable, Rice's solutions\r\nmay be employed:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Bromin,             31\r\n        Potassium bromid,   31\r\n        Distilled water,   250.\r\n  (_b_) Caustic soda,      100\r\n        Distilled water,   250.\r\n\r\nOne part of each of these solutions and two parts of water are mixed\r\nand used for the test. The bromin solution must be kept in a tightly\r\nstoppered bottle or it will rapidly lose strength.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n5. Uric Acid.--Uric acid is the most important of a group of\r\nsubstances, called _purin bodies_, which are derived chiefly from the\r\nnucleins of the food and from metabolic destruction of the nuclei of\r\nthe body. The daily output of uric acid is about 0.4 to 1 gm. The\r\namount of the other purin bodies together is about one-tenth that of\r\nuric acid. Excretion of these substances is greatly increased by a\r\ndiet rich in nuclei, as sweetbreads and liver.\r\n\r\nUric acid exists in the urine in the form of urates, which in\r\nconcentrated urines are readily thrown out of solution and constitute\r\nthe familiar sediment of \"amorphous urates.\" This, together with the\r\nfact that uric acid is frequently deposited as crystals, constitutes\r\nits chief interest to the practitioner. It is a very common error to\r\nconsider these deposits as evidence of excessive excretion.\r\n\r\nPathologically, the greatest increase of uric acid occurs {68} in\r\nleukemia, where there is extensive destruction of leukocytes, and in\r\ndiseases with active destruction of the liver and other organs rich in\r\nnuclei. Uric acid is decreased before an attack of gout and increased\r\nafterward, but its etiologic relation is still uncertain. An increase\r\nis also noted in the uric-acid diathesis and in diseases accompanied\r\nby respiratory insufficiency.\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Estimation_.--The following are the best methods for\r\nordinary clinical purposes, although no great accuracy can be claimed\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Ruhemann's uricometer.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCook's Method for Purin Bodies.--In a centrifuge tube take 10 c.c.\r\nurine and add about 1 gm. (about 1 c.c.) sodium carbonate and 1 or 2\r\nc.c. strong ammonia. Shake until the soda is dissolved. The earthy\r\nphosphates will be precipitated. Centrifugalize thoroughly and pour\r\noff all the clear fluid into a graduated centrifuge tube. Add 2 c.c.\r\nammonia and 2 c.c. ammoniated silver nitrate solution. Let stand a few\r\nminutes, and revolve in the centrifuge until the bulk of precipitate\r\n_remains constant_. Each one-tenth cubic centimeter of sediment\r\nrepresents 0.001176 gm. purin bodies. This amount may be regarded as\r\nuric acid, since this substance usually constitutes nine-tenths of the\r\npurin bodies and the clinical significance is the same.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniated silver nitrate solution_ is prepared by dissolving 5 gm.\r\nof silver nitrate {69} in 100 c.c. distilled water, and adding ammonia\r\nuntil the solution clouds and again becomes clear.\r\n\r\nRuhemann's Method for Uric Acid.--The urine must be slightly acid.\r\nFill Ruhemann's tube (Fig. 21) to the mark _S_ with the indicator,\r\ncarbon disulphid, and to the mark _J_ with the reagent. The carbon\r\ndisulphid will assume a violet color. Add the urine, a small quantity\r\nat a time, closing the tube with the glass stopper and shaking\r\nvigorously after each addition, until the disulphid loses every trace\r\nof its violet color and becomes pure white. This completes the test.\r\nThe figure in the right-hand column of figures corresponding to the\r\ntop of the fluid gives the amount of uric acid in parts per thousand.\r\nThe presence of diacetic acid interferes with the test.\r\n\r\n_Ruhemann's reagent_ consists of iodin and potassium iodid, each 1.5\r\nparts; absolute alcohol, 15 parts; and distilled water, 185 parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB. ABNORMAL CONSTITUENTS\r\n\r\nThose substances which appear in the urine only in pathologic\r\nconditions are of much more interest to the clinician than are those\r\nwhich have just been discussed. Among them are: proteids, sugars, the\r\nacetone bodies, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances. The\r\n\"pancreatic reaction\" and detection of drugs in the urine will also be\r\ndiscussed under this head.\r\n\r\n1. Proteids.--Of the proteids which may appear in the urine,\r\nserum-albumin and serum-globulin are the most important. Mucin,\r\nalbumose, and a few others are found occasionally, but are of less\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n(1) Serum-albumin and Serum-globulin.--These two proteids constitute\r\nthe so-called \"urinary albumin.\" They usually occur together, have\r\npractically the same {70} significance, and both respond to all the\r\nordinary tests for \"albumin.\"\r\n\r\nTheir presence, or _albuminuria_, is probably the most important\r\npathologic condition of the urine. It is either _accidental_ or\r\n_renal_. The physician can make no greater mistake than to regard all\r\ncases of albuminuria as indicating kidney disease.\r\n\r\n_Accidental_ or _false albuminuria_ is due to admixture with the urine\r\nof albuminous fluids, such as pus, blood, and vaginal discharge. The\r\nmicroscope will usually reveal its nature.\r\n\r\n_Renal albuminuria_ refers to albumin which has passed from the blood\r\ninto the urine through the walls of the kidney tubules or the\r\nglomeruli. It probably never occurs as a physiologic condition, the\r\nso-called \"functional albuminuria\" being due to obscure or slight\r\npathologic changes.\r\n\r\nRenal albuminuria may be referred to one or more of the following\r\ncauses. In practically all cases it is accompanied by tube-casts.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Changes in the blood_ which render its albumin more diffusible,\r\nas in severe anemias, purpura, and scurvy. Here the albumin is small\r\nin amount.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Changes in circulation in the kidney_, either anemia or\r\ncongestion, as in excessive exercise, chronic heart disease, and\r\npressure upon the renal veins. The quantity of albumin is usually, but\r\nnot always, small. Its presence is constant or temporary, according to\r\nthe cause. Most of the causes, if continued, will produce organic\r\nchanges in the kidney.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Organic Changes in the Kidney_.--These include the inflammatory\r\nand degenerative changes commonly grouped {71} together under the name\r\nof nephritis, and also renal tuberculosis, neoplasms, and cloudy\r\nswelling due to irritation of toxins and drugs. The amount of albumin\r\neliminated in these conditions varies from minute traces to 20 gm., or\r\neven more, in the twenty-four hours, and, except in acute processes,\r\nbears little relation to the severity of the disease. In acute and\r\nchronic parenchymatous nephritis the quantity is usually very large.\r\nIn chronic interstitial nephritis it is small--frequently no more than\r\na trace. It is small in cloudy swelling from toxins and drugs, and\r\nvariable in renal tuberculosis and neoplasms. In amyloid disease of\r\nthe kidney the quantity is usually small, and serum-globulin may be\r\npresent in especially large proportion, or even alone. Roughly\r\ndistinctive of serum-globulin is the appearance of an opalescent cloud\r\nwhen a few drops of the urine are dropped into a glass of distilled\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Detection of albumin_ depends upon its coagulation by chemicals or\r\nheat. There are many tests, but none is entirely satisfactory, because\r\nother substances as well as albumin are precipitated. The most common\r\nsource of error is mucin. The tests given here are widely used and can\r\nbe recommended. They make no distinction between serum-albumin and\r\nserum-globulin. They are given as nearly as possible in order of their\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that urine to be tested for albumin be rendered\r\nclear by filtration or centrifugation. This is too often neglected in\r\nroutine work. When ordinary methods do not suffice, it can usually be\r\ncleared by shaking up with a little magnesium carbonate and filtering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Trichloracetic Acid Test.--The reagent consists of a saturated\r\naqueous solution of trichloracetic acid to which {72} magnesium\r\nsulphate is added to saturation. A simple saturated solution of the\r\nacid may be used, but addition of magnesium sulphate favors\r\nprecipitation of globulin, and by raising the specific gravity, makes\r\nthe test easier to apply.\r\n\r\nTake a few c.c. of the reagent in a test-tube or conical test glass,\r\nhold the tube or glass in an inclined position, and run the urine\r\ngently in by means of a pipet, so that it will form a layer on top of\r\nthe reagent without mixing with it. If albumin be present, a white,\r\ncloudy ring will appear where the two fluids come in contact. The ring\r\ncan be seen most clearly if viewed against a black background, and one\r\nside of the tube or conical glass may be painted black for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Horismascope: adding the reagent.]\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely sensitive test, but, unfortunately, both mucin\r\nand albumose respond to it; urates when abundant may give a confusing\r\nwhite ring, and the reagent is {73} comparatively expensive. It is not\r\nmuch used in routine work except as a control to the less sensitive\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nA most convenient instrument for applying this or any of the contact\r\ntests is sold under the name of \"horismascope\" (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n(2) Robert's Test.--The reagent consists of pure nitric acid, 1 part,\r\nand saturated aqueous solution of magnesium sulphate, 5 parts. It is\r\napplied in the same way as the preceding test.\r\n\r\nAlbumin gives a white ring, which varies in density with the amount\r\npresent. A similar white ring may be produced by albumose and resinous\r\ndrugs. White rings or cloudiness in the urine above the zone of\r\ncontact may result from excess of urates or mucus. Colored rings near\r\nthe junction of the fluids may be produced by urinary pigments, bile,\r\nor indican.\r\n\r\nRobert's test is one of the best for routine work, although the\r\nvarious rings are apt to be confusing to the inexperienced. It is more\r\nsensitive than Heller's test, of which it is a modification, and has\r\nthe additional advantage that the reagent is not so corrosive.\r\n\r\n(3) Purdy's Heat Test.--Take a test-tube two-thirds full of urine, add\r\nabout one-sixth its volume of saturated solution of sodium chlorid and\r\n5 to 10 drops of 50 per cent. acetic acid. Mix, and boil the upper\r\ninch. A white cloud in the heated portion shows the presence of\r\nalbumin.\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable test for routine work. It is simple, sufficiently\r\naccurate for clinical purposes, and has practically no fallacies.\r\nAddition of the salt solution, by raising the specific gravity,\r\nprevents precipitation of mucin. Albumose may produce a white cloud\r\nwhich disappears upon boiling and reappears upon cooling.\r\n\r\n(4) Heat and Nitric Acid Test.--This is one of the oldest of the\r\nalbumin tests, and, if properly carried out, one of the best. Boil a\r\nsmall quantity of filtered urine in a test-tube and add about\r\none-twentieth its volume of concentrated nitric {74} acid. A white\r\ncloud or flocculent precipitate (which usually appears during the\r\nboiling, but if the quantity be very small only after addition of the\r\nacid) denotes the presence of albumin. A similar white precipitate,\r\nwhich disappears upon addition of the acid, is due to earthy\r\nphosphates. The acid should not be added before boiling, and the\r\nproper amount should always be used; otherwise, part of the albumin\r\nmay fail to be precipitated or may be redissolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Estimation_.--The gravimetric, which is the most\r\nreliable method, is too elaborate for clinical work. Both Esbach's,\r\nwhich is very widely used, and the centrifugal method give fair\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Esbach's Method.--The urine must be clear, of acid reaction, and\r\nnot concentrated. Always filter before testing, and, if necessary, add\r\nacetic acid and dilute with water. Esbach's tube (Fig. 23) is\r\nessentially a test-tube with a mark _U_ near the middle, a mark _R_\r\nnear the top, and graduations ½, 1, 2, 3, etc., near the bottom. Fill\r\nthe tube to the mark _U_ with urine and to the mark _R_ with the\r\nreagent. Close with a rubber stopper, invert slowly several times, and\r\nset aside in a cool place. At the end of twenty-four hours read off\r\nthe height of the precipitate. This gives the amount of albumin in\r\n_grams per liter, and must be divided by 10 to obtain the percentage_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Esbach's albuminometer, improved form.]\r\n\r\n_Esbach's reagent_ consists of picric acid, 1 gm., citric acid, 2 gm.,\r\nand distilled water, to make 100 c.c.\r\n\r\n(2) Purdy's Centrifugal Method.--This is detailed in the accompanying\r\ntable.

centimeters of 50 per cent.\r\nacetic acid are added to 10 cubic centimeters of the urine in the\r\npercentage tube and _stood aside for ten minutes_, then placed in the\r\ncentrifuge and revolved at rate of speed and time as stated at head of\r\nthe table. If albumin is excessive, dilute the urine with water until\r\nvolume of albumin falls below 10 per cent. Multiply result by the\r\nnumber of dilutions employed before using the table.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{76} (2) Mucin (Nucleo-albumin).--Traces of the substances which are\r\nloosely classed under this name are present in normal urine; increased\r\namounts are observed in irritations and inflammations of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the urinary tract. They are of interest chiefly because\r\nthey may be mistaken for albumin in most of the tests. If the urine be\r\ndiluted with water and acidified with acetic acid, the appearance of a\r\nwhite cloud indicates the presence of mucin.\r\n\r\n(3) Albumoses.--These are intermediate products in the digestion of\r\nproteids. They have been observed in the urine in febrile and\r\nmalignant diseases and chronic suppurations, but their clinical\r\nsignificance is indefinite. The following is a simple test: Mix equal\r\nparts of the urine, which has been strongly acidified with acetic\r\nacid, and a saturated solution of sodium chlorid. A white cloud, which\r\nappears upon moderate heating and disappears upon boiling, shows the\r\npresence of albumose. If the cloud increases upon boiling, albumin is\r\npresent and should be removed by filtering while hot. The cloud due to\r\nalbumose will reappear as the filtrate cools.\r\n\r\n2. Sugars.--Various sugars may at times be found in the urine. Glucose\r\nis by far the most common, and is the only one of clinical importance.\r\nLevulose, lactose, and some others are occasionally met with.\r\n\r\n(1) Glucose (Dextrose).--It is probable that traces of glucose, too\r\nsmall to respond to the ordinary tests, are present in the urine in\r\nhealth. Its presence in appreciable amount constitutes \"glycosuria.\"\r\n\r\n_Transitory_ glycosuria is unimportant, and may occur in many\r\nconditions, as after general anesthesia and {77} administration of\r\ncertain drugs, in pregnancy, and following shock and head injuries.\r\n\r\n_Persistent_ glycosuria has been noted in brain injuries involving the\r\nfloor of the fourth ventricle. As a rule, however, persistent\r\nglycosuria is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus, of which disease it is\r\nthe essential symptom. The amount of glucose eliminated in diabetes is\r\nusually considerable, and is sometimes very large, reaching 500 gm.,\r\nor even more in twenty-four hours, but it does not bear any uniform\r\nrelation to the severity of the disease. Glucose may, on the other\r\nhand, be almost or entirely absent temporarily.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Glucose_.--If albumin be present in more than traces, it\r\nmust be removed by boiling and filtering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Haines' Test.--Take about 1 dram of Haines' solution in a\r\ntest-tube, boil, and add 6 or 8 drops of urine. A heavy yellow or red\r\nprecipitate, which settles readily to the bottom, shows the presence\r\nof sugar. Neither precipitation of phosphates as a light flocculent\r\nsediment nor simple decolorization of the reagent should be mistaken\r\nfor a positive reaction.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best of the copper tests, all of which depend\r\nupon the fact that in strongly alkaline solutions glucose reduces\r\ncopper oxid to lower grades of oxidation. They are somewhat\r\ninaccurate, because they make no distinction between glucose and less\r\ncommon forms of sugar; because certain normal substances when present\r\nin excess, especially uric acid and creatinin, may reduce copper, and\r\nbecause many drugs--_e.g._, chloral, chloroform, copaiba, acetanilid,\r\nbenzoic acid, morphin, sulphonal, salicylates--are eliminated as\r\ncopper-reducing substances. To minimize these fallacies dilute the\r\nurine if it be concentrated, do not add more than the specified amount\r\nof urine, and do not boil after the urine is added.\r\n\r\n{78} _Haines' solution_ is prepared as follows: completely dissolve 30\r\ngr. pure copper sulphate in ½ oz. distilled water, and add ½ oz. pure\r\nglycerin; mix thoroughly, and add 5 oz. liquor potassæ. The solution\r\nkeeps well.\r\n\r\n(2) Fehling's Test.--Two solutions are required--one containing 34.64\r\ngm. pure crystalline copper sulphate in 500 c.c. distilled water; the\r\nother, 173 gm. Rochelle salt and 100 gm. potassium hydroxid in\r\n500 c.c. distilled water. Mix equal parts of the two solutions in a\r\ntest-tube, dilute with 3 or 4 volumes of water, and boil. Add the\r\nurine a little at a time, heating, but not boiling, between additions.\r\nIn the presence of glucose a heavy red or yellow precipitate will\r\nappear. The quantity of urine should not exceed that of the reagent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Crystals of phenylglucosazone from diabetic\r\nurine--Kowarsky's test. X500.]\r\n\r\n(3) Phenylhydrazin Test.--_Kowarsky's Method_.--In a test-tube take 5\r\ndrops pure phenylhydrazin, 10 drops glacial acetic acid, and 1 c.c.\r\nsaturated solution of sodium chlorid. A curdy mass results. Add 2 or\r\n3 cc. urine, boil for at least two minutes, and set aside to cool.\r\nExamine the sediment with the microscope, using a two-thirds\r\nobjective. If glucose {79} be present, characteristic crystals of\r\nphenylglucosazone will be seen. These are yellow, needle-like crystals\r\narranged mostly in clusters or in sheaves (Fig. 24). When traces only\r\nof glucose are present, the crystals may not appear for one-half hour\r\nor more. Best crystals are obtained when the fluid is cooled very\r\nslowly. It must not be agitated during cooling.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent test for clinical work. It requires slightly more\r\ntime than Haines' test, but more than compensates for this by\r\nincreased accuracy. It is fully as sensitive as Haines', and has\r\npractically no fallacies excepting levulose, which is a fallacy for\r\nall tests but the polariscope. Other carbohydrates which are capable\r\nof forming crystals with phenylhydrazin are extremely unlikely to do\r\nso when the test is applied directly to the urine by the method just\r\ndetailed. Even if not used routinely, this test should always be\r\nresorted to when Haines' test gives a positive reaction in doubtful\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Quantitative Estimation_.--In quantitative work Fehling's solution,\r\nfor so many years the standard, has been largely displaced by Purdy's,\r\nwhich avoids the heavy precipitate that so greatly obscures the\r\nend-reaction in Fehling's method. The older method is still preferred\r\nby many, and both are, therefore, given. Should the urine contain much\r\nglucose, it must be diluted before making any quantitative test,\r\nallowance being made for the dilution in the subsequent calculation.\r\nAlbumin, if present, must be removed by acidifying a considerable\r\nquantity of urine with acetic acid, boiling, and filtering. The\r\nprecipitate should then be washed with water and the washings added to\r\nthe urine to bring it to its original volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Purdy's Method.--Take exactly 35 c.c. of Purdy's solution in a\r\nflask or beaker, add twice its volume of distilled {80} water, heat to\r\nboiling, and, still keeping the solution hot, add the urine very\r\nslowly from a buret until the blue color entirely disappears. Read off\r\nthe amount of urine added; considering the strength of Purdy's\r\nsolution, it is readily seen that this amount of urine contains 0.02\r\ngm. of glucose, from which the amount in the twenty-four-hour urine,\r\nor the percentage, can easily be calculated. Example: Suppose that\r\n2.5 c.c. of urine discharged the blue color of 35 c.c. of Purdy's\r\nsolution. This amount of urine, therefore, contains exactly 0.02 gm.\r\nglucose, and the percentage is obtained from the\r\nequation: 2.5:100 :: 0.02:_x_, and _x_ equals 0.8 per cent. If, then,\r\nthe twenty-four-hour quantity of urine were 3000 c.c., the\r\ntwenty-four-hour elimination of glucose would be found as follows:\r\n100:3000 :: 0.8:_x_, and _x_ equals 24 gm.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that after the test is completed the blue color\r\nslowly returns. This is due to reoxidation, and should not be mistaken\r\nfor incomplete reduction.\r\n\r\nA somewhat simpler application of this method, which is accurate\r\nenough for clinical purposes, is as follows: Take 8¾ c.c. (roughly,\r\n9 c.c.) of Purdy's solution in a large test-tube, dilute with an equal\r\nvolume of water, heat to boiling, and, while keeping the solution hot\r\nbut not boiling, add the urine drop by drop from a medicine-dropper\r\nuntil the blue color is entirely gone. Toward the end add the drops\r\nvery slowly, not more than 4 or 5 a minute. Divide 10 by the number of\r\ndrops required to discharge the blue color; the quotient will be the\r\npercentage of glucose. If 20 drops were required, the percentage would\r\nbe 10÷20 = 0.5 per cent. It is imperative that the drops be of such\r\nsize that 20 of them will make 1 c.c. Test the dropper with urine, not\r\nwater. If the drops are too large, draw out the tip of the dropper; if\r\ntoo small, file off the tip.\r\n\r\n_Purdy's solution_ consists of pure crystalline copper sulphate,\r\n4.752 gm.; potassium hydroxid, 23.5 gm.; ammonia (U.S.P.; sp. gr.,\r\n0.9), 350 c.c.; glycerin, 38 c.c.; distilled water, to make {81}\r\n1000 c.c. Dissolve the copper sulphate and glycerin in 200 c.c. of the\r\nwater by aid of gentle heat. In another 200 c.c. of water dissolve the\r\npotassium hydroxid. Mix the two solutions, and when cool, add the\r\nammonia. Lastly, bring the whole up to 1000 c.c. with distilled water.\r\nThis solution is of such strength that the copper in 35 c.c. will be\r\nreduced by exactly 0.02 gm. of glucose.\r\n\r\n(2) Fehling's Method.--Take 10 c.c. Fehling's solution (made by mixing\r\n5 c.c. each of the copper and alkaline solutions described on page 78)\r\nin a flask or beaker, add three or four volumes of water, boil, and\r\nadd the urine very slowly from a buret until the solution is\r\ncompletely decolorized, heating but not boiling after each addition.\r\n\r\nFehling's solution is of such strength that the copper in 10 c.c. will\r\nbe reduced by exactly 0.05 gm. of glucose. Therefore, the amount of\r\nurine required to decolorize the test solution contains just 0.05 gm.\r\nglucose, and the percentage is easily calculated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Einhorn's saccharimeter.]\r\n\r\n(3) Fermentation Method.--This is convenient and satisfactory, its\r\nchief disadvantage being the time required. It {82} depends upon the\r\nfact that glucose is fermented by yeast with evolution of CO_{2}. The\r\namount of gas evolved is an index of the amount of glucose. Einhorn's\r\nsaccharimeter (Fig. 25) is the simplest apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe urine must be so diluted as to contain not more than 1 per cent.\r\nof glucose. A fragment of fresh yeast cake about the size of a split\r\npea is mixed with a definite quantity of the urine measured in the\r\ntube which accompanies the apparatus. It should form an emulsion free\r\nfrom lumps or air-bubbles. The long arm of the apparatus is then\r\nfilled with the mixture. At the end of fifteen to twenty-four hours\r\nfermentation will be complete, and the percentage of glucose can be\r\nread off upon the side of the tube. The result must then be multiplied\r\nby the degree of dilution. Since yeast itself sometimes gives off gas,\r\na control test must be carried out with normal urine and the amount of\r\ngas evolved must be subtracted from that of the test.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Levulose, or fruit-sugar, is very rarely present in the urine\r\nexcept in association with glucose, and has about the same\r\nsignificance. Its name is derived from the fact that it rotates\r\npolarized light to the left. It behaves the same as glucose with all\r\nthe ordinary tests, and can be distinguished only by polarization.\r\n\r\n(3) Lactose, or milk-sugar, is sometimes present in the urine of\r\nnursing women and in that of women who have recently miscarried. It is\r\nof interest chiefly because it may be mistaken for glucose. It reduces\r\ncopper, but does not ferment with yeast. In strong solution it can\r\nform crystals with phenylhydrazin, but is extremely unlikely to do so\r\nwhen the test is applied directly to the urine.\r\n\r\n3. Acetone Bodies.--This is a group of closely related\r\nsubstances--acetone, diacetic acid, and beta-oxybutyric {83} acid.\r\nAcetone is derived from decomposition of diacetic acid, and this in\r\nturn from beta-oxybutyric acid by oxidation. The origin of\r\nbeta-oxybutyric acid is not definitely known, but it is probable that\r\nits chief, if not its only, source is in some obscure metabolic\r\ndisturbance with abnormal destruction of fats. The three substances\r\ngenerally appear in the urine in the order mentioned. When the\r\ndisturbance is mild, acetone only appears; as it becomes more marked,\r\ndiacetic acid is added, and finally beta-oxybutyric acid appears. The\r\npresence of beta-oxybutyric acid in the blood is probably the chief\r\ncause of the form of auto-intoxication known as \"acid intoxication.\"\r\n\r\n(1) Acetone.--Minute traces, too small for the ordinary tests, may be\r\npresent in the urine under normal conditions. Larger amounts are not\r\nuncommon in fevers, gastrointestinal disturbances, and certain nervous\r\ndisorders. Occurrence of acetonuria in pregnancy suggests death of the\r\nfetus.\r\n\r\nAcetonuria is practically always observed in acid intoxication, and,\r\ntogether with diaceturia, constitutes its most significant diagnostic\r\nsign. A similar or identical toxic condition, always accompanied by\r\nacetonuria and often fatal, is now being recognized as a not\r\ninfrequent late effect of anesthesia, particularly of chloroform\r\nanesthesia. This postanesthetic toxemia is more likely to appear, and\r\nis more severe when the urine contains any notable amount of acetone\r\nbefore operation, which suggests the importance of routine examination\r\nfor acetone in surgical cases.\r\n\r\nAcetone is present in considerable amounts in many cases of diabetes\r\nmellitus, and is always present in severe {84} cases. Its amount is a\r\nbetter indication of the severity of the disease than is the amount of\r\nsugar. A progressive increase is a grave prognostic sign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--A simple distilling apparatus.]\r\n\r\n_Detection of Acetone_.--The urine may be tested directly, but it is\r\nbest to distil it after adding a little phosphoric or hydrochloric\r\nacid to prevent foaming, and to test the first few cubic centimeters\r\nof distillate. A simple distilling apparatus is shown in Fig. 26. The\r\ntest-tube may be attached to the delivery tube by means of a two-hole\r\nrubber cork as shown, the second hole serving as air vent, or, what is\r\nmuch less satisfactory, it may be tied in place with a string. Should\r\nthe vapor not condense well, the test-tube may be immersed in a glass\r\nof cold water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Gunning's Test.--To a few cubic centimeters of urine or distillate\r\nin a test-tube add a few drops of tincture of iodin {85} and of\r\nammonia alternately until a heavy black cloud appears. This cloud will\r\ngradually clear up, and if acetone be present, iodoform, usually\r\ncrystalline, will separate out. The iodoform can be recognized by its\r\nodor, especially upon heating (there is danger of explosion if the\r\nmixture be heated before the black cloud disappears), or by detection\r\nof the crystals microscopically. The latter, only, is safe, unless one\r\nhas an unusually acute sense of smell. Iodoform crystals are\r\nyellowish, six-pointed stars or six-sided plates (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Iodoform crystals obtained in several tests\r\nfor acetone by Gunning's method (X about 600).]\r\n\r\nThis modification of Lieben's test is less sensitive than the\r\noriginal, but is sufficient for all clinical work; it has the\r\nadvantage that alcohol does not cause confusion, and especially that\r\nthe sediment of iodoform is practically always crystalline. When\r\napplied directly to the urine, phosphates are precipitated and may\r\nform star-shaped crystals which are very confusing to the\r\ninexperienced.\r\n\r\n(2) Lange's Test.--This is a modification of the well-known Legal\r\ntest. It is more sensitive and gives a sharper end-reaction. To a\r\nsmall quantity of urine add about one-twentieth its volume (1 drop for\r\neach 1 c.c.) of glacial acetic acid and a few drops of fresh\r\nconcentrated aqueous solution of {86} sodium nitroprussid, and gently\r\nrun a little ammonia upon its surface. If acetone be present, a purple\r\nring will form within a few minutes at the junction of the two fluids.\r\n\r\n(3) Trommer's Test.--This new test has proved very satisfactory in the\r\nhands of the writer. The urine need not be distilled. Alkalinize about\r\n10 c.c. of the urine with 2 or 3 c.c. of 40 per cent. caustic soda\r\nsolution, add 10 or 12 drops of 10 per cent. alcoholic solution of\r\nsalicylous acid (salicyl aldehyd), heat the upper portion nearly to\r\nthe boiling-point, and keep at this temperature five minutes or\r\nlonger. In the presence of acetone a purplish-red color appears in the\r\nheated portion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Diacetic acid occurs in the same conditions as acetone, but is\r\nless frequent and has more serious significance. In diabetes its\r\npresence is a grave symptom and often forewarns of approaching coma.\r\nIt rarely or never occurs without acetone.\r\n\r\n_Detection_.--The urine must be fresh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Gerhardt's Test.--To a few cubic centimeters of the urine add\r\nsolution of ferric chlorid (about 10 per cent.) drop by drop until the\r\nphosphates are precipitated; filter and add more of the ferric\r\nchlorid. If diacetic acid be present, the urine will assume a\r\nBordeaux-red color which disappears upon boiling. A red or violet\r\ncolor which does not disappear upon boiling may be produced by other\r\nsubstances, as phenol, salicylates, and antipyrin.\r\n\r\n(2) Lindemann's Test.--To about 10 c.c. of urine add 5 drops 30 per\r\ncent. acetic acid, 5 drops Lugol's solution, and 2 or 3 c.c.\r\nchloroform, and shake. The chloroform does not change color if\r\ndiacetic acid be present, but becomes reddish-violet in its absence.\r\nThis test is claimed by its advocates to be more sensitive and more\r\nreliable than Gerhardt's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{87} (3) Oxybutyric acid has much the same significance as diacetic\r\nacid, but is of more serious import. There is no satisfactory clinical\r\ntest for it.\r\n\r\n4. Bile.--Bile appears in the urine in all diseases which produce\r\njaundice, often some days before the skin becomes yellow; and in many\r\ndisorders of the liver not severe enough to cause jaundice. It also\r\noccurs in diseases with extensive and rapid destruction of red\r\nblood-corpuscles. Both bile-pigment and bile acids may be found. They\r\ngenerally occur together, but the pigment is not infrequently present\r\nalone. Bilirubin, only, occurs in freshly voided urine, the other\r\npigments (biliverdin, bilifuscin, etc.) being produced from this by\r\noxidation as the urine stands. The acids are almost never present\r\nwithout the pigments, and are, therefore, seldom tested for\r\nclinically.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Bile-pigment_.--Bile-pigment gives the urine a\r\ngreenish-yellow, yellow, or brown color, which upon shaking is\r\nimparted to the foam. Cells, casts, and other structures in the\r\nsediment may be stained brown or yellow. This, however, should not be\r\naccepted as proving the presence of bile without further tests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Smith's Test.--Overlay the urine with tincture of iodin diluted\r\nwith nine times its volume of alcohol. An emerald-green ring at the\r\nzone of contact shows the presence of bile-pigments. It is convenient\r\nto use a conical test-glass, one side of which is painted white.\r\n\r\n(2) Gmelin's Test.--This consists in bringing slightly yellow nitric\r\nacid into contact with the urine. A play of colors, of which green and\r\nviolet are most distinctive, denotes the presence of bile-pigment.\r\nColorless nitric add will become yellow upon standing in the sunlight.\r\nThe test may be applied {88} in various ways: by overlaying the acid\r\nwith the urine; by bringing a drop of each together upon a porcelain\r\nplate; by filtering the urine through thick filter-paper, and touching\r\nthe paper with a drop of the acid; and, probably best of all, by\r\nprecipitating with lime-water, filtering, and touching the precipitate\r\nwith a drop of the acid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Detection of Bile Acids_.--Hay's test is simple, sensitive, and\r\nfairly reliable, and will, therefore, appeal to the practitioner. It\r\ndepends upon the fact that bile acids lower surface tension. Other\r\ntests require isolation of the acids for any degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHay's Test.--Upon the surface of the urine, which must not be warm,\r\nsprinkle a little finely powdered sulphur. If it sinks at once, bile\r\nacids are present to the amount of 0.01 per cent. or more; if only\r\nafter gentle shaking, 0.0025 per cent. or more. If it remains\r\nfloating, even after gentle shaking, bile acids are absent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n5. Hemoglobin.--The presence in the urine of hemoglobin or pigments\r\ndirectly derived from it, accompanied by few, if any, red corpuscles,\r\nconstitutes _hemoglobinuria_. It is a rare condition, and must be\r\ndistinguished from _hematuria_, or _blood_ in the urine, which is\r\ncommon. In both conditions chemic tests will show hemoglobin, but in\r\nthe latter the microscope will reveal the presence of red corpuscles.\r\nUrines which contain notable amounts of hemoglobin have a reddish or\r\nbrown color, and may deposit a sediment of brown, granular pigment.\r\n\r\nHemoglobinuria occurs when there is such extensive destruction of red\r\nblood-cells within the body that the liver cannot transform all the\r\nhemoglobin set free into bile-pigment. The most important examples are\r\nseen in {89} poisoning, as by mushrooms and potassium chlorate, in\r\nmalignant malaria (blackwater fever), and in the obscure condition\r\nknown as \"paroxysmal hemoglobinuria.\" This last is characterized by\r\nthe appearance of large quantities of hemoglobin at intervals, usually\r\nfollowing exposure to cold, the urine remaining free from hemoglobin\r\nbetween the attacks.\r\n\r\n_Detection_.--Teichmann's test (p. 202) may be applied to the\r\nprecipitate after boiling and filtering, but the guaiac test is more\r\nconvenient in routine work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGuaiac Test.--Mix equal parts of \"ozonized\" turpentine and fresh\r\ntincture of guaiac which has been diluted with alcohol to a light\r\nsherry-wine color. In a test-tube or conical glass overlay the urine\r\nwith this mixture. A bright blue ring will appear at the zone of\r\ncontact within a few minutes if hemoglobin be present. The guaiac\r\nshould be kept in an amber-colored bottle. Fresh turpentine can be\r\n\"ozonized\" by allowing it to stand a few days in an open vessel in the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nThis test is very sensitive, and a negative result proves the absence\r\nof hemoglobin. Positive results are not conclusive, because numerous\r\nother substances--few of them likely to be found in the urine--may\r\nproduce the blue color. That most likely to cause confusion is pus,\r\nbut the blue color produced by it disappears upon heating. The thin\r\nfilm of copper often left in a test-tube after testing for sugar may\r\ngive the reaction, as may also the fumes from an open bottle of\r\nbromin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n6. Diazo Substances.--Certain unknown substances sometimes present in\r\nthe urine give a characteristic color reaction--the \"diazo reaction\"\r\nof Ehrlich--when treated with diazo-benzol-sulphonic acid and ammonia.\r\nThis reaction has much clinical value provided its limitations {90} be\r\nrecognized. It is at best an empirical test and must be interpreted in\r\nthe light of clinical symptoms. Although it has been met with in a\r\nconsiderable number of diseases, its usefulness is practically limited\r\nto typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and measles.\r\n\r\n(1) Typhoid Fever.--Practically all cases give a positive reaction,\r\nwhich varies in intensity with the severity of the disease. It is so\r\nconstantly present that it may be said to be \"negatively\r\npathognomonic\": if negative at a stage of the disease when it should\r\nbe positive, typhoid is almost certainly absent. Upon the other hand,\r\na reaction when the urine is highly diluted (1:50 or more) has much\r\npositive diagnostic value, since this dilution prevents the reaction\r\nin most conditions which might be mistaken for typhoid; but it should\r\nbe noted that mild cases of typhoid may not give it at this dilution.\r\nOrdinarily the diazo appears a little earlier than the Widal\r\nreaction--about the fourth or fifth day--but it may be delayed. In\r\ncontrast to the Widal, it begins to fade about the end of the second\r\nweek, and soon thereafter entirely disappears. An early disappearance\r\nis a favorable sign. It reappears during a relapse, and thus helps to\r\ndistinguish between a relapse and a complication, in which it does not\r\nreappear.\r\n\r\n(2) Tuberculosis.--The diazo reaction has been obtained in many forms\r\nof the disease. It has little or no diagnostic value. Its continued\r\npresence in pulmonary tuberculosis is, however, a grave prognostic\r\nsign, even when the physical signs are slight. After it once appears\r\nit generally persists more or less intermittently until death, the\r\naverage length of life after its appearance being about six months.\r\nThe reaction is often temporarily present in {91} mild cases during\r\nfebrile complications, and has then no significance.\r\n\r\n(3) Measles.--A positive reaction is frequently obtained in measles,\r\nand may help to distinguish this disease from German measles, in which\r\nit does not occur.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTechnic.--Although the test is really a very simple one, careful\r\nattention to technic is imperative. Many of the early workers were\r\nvery lax in this regard. Faulty technic and failure to record the\r\nstage of the disease in which the tests were made have probably been\r\nresponsible for the bulk of the conflicting results reported.\r\n\r\nCertain drugs often given in tuberculosis and typhoid interfere with\r\nor prevent the reaction. The chief are creosote, tannic acid and its\r\ncompounds, opium and its alkaloids, salol, phenol, and the iodids. The\r\nreagents are:\r\n\r\n(1) Saturated solution sulphanilic acid in 5 per cent. hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n(2) 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution sodium nitrite.\r\n\r\n(3) Strong ammonia.\r\n\r\nMix forty parts of (1) and one part of (2). In a test-tube take equal\r\nparts of this mixture and the urine, and pour 1 or 2 c.c. of the\r\nammonia upon its surface. If the reaction be positive, a garnet ring\r\nwill form at the junction of the two fluids; and upon shaking, a\r\ndistinct pink color will be imparted to the foam. The color of the\r\nfoam is the essential feature. If desired, the mixture may be well\r\nshaken before the ammonia is added: the pink color will then instantly\r\nappear in that portion of the foam which the ammonia has reached, and\r\ncan be readily seen. The color varies from eosin-pink to deep crimson,\r\ndepending upon the intensity of the reaction. A doubtful reaction\r\nshould be considered negative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n7. Pancreatic Reaction.--Cammidge has shown that in cases of\r\npancreatitis a substance capable of forming {92} crystals with\r\nphenylhydrazin can be developed by boiling the urine with a mineral\r\nacid, and has offered the following test as an aid in diagnosis of\r\nthis obscure condition. The nature both of this substance and the\r\nantecedent substance from which it is derived is not known. As\r\noriginally proposed, the test was complicated and probably not\r\ntrustworthy, but with his improved and simplified technic, Cammidge\r\nhas had very promising results. In 200 consecutive examinations in\r\nwhich the diagnosis was confirmed, _postmortem_ or at operation, 67\r\ncases of pancreatitis (65 chronic, 2 acute) gave positive reactions; 4\r\ncases of cancer of the pancreas were positive, 12 negative; 4 cases in\r\nwhich no pancreatitis was found were positive, 113 were negative.\r\nNormal urines do not give the reaction. The difficulty and importance\r\nof diagnosis in pancreatitis warrant inclusion of the method here even\r\nthough its true value cannot be definitely assigned. While the test is\r\nsomewhat tedious, all the manipulations are simple and require no\r\napparatus but flasks, test-tubes, and funnels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTechnic.--Careful attention to detail is imperative. An ordinary\r\nroutine examination is first made. Albumin and sugar, if present, must\r\nbe removed: the former, by acidifying with acetic acid, boiling, and\r\nfiltering; the latter, by fermentation with yeast after the first step\r\nof the method proper. An alkaline urine should be made slightly acid\r\nwith hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n(1) Forty cubic centimeters of the urine, which has been rendered\r\nperfectly clear by repeated filtration through the same filter-paper,\r\nare placed in a small flask, treated with 1 c.c. concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid and gently boiled on a sand-bath for ten minutes, a\r\nfunnel with long stem being placed in the neck of the flask to act as\r\na condenser (Fig. 28). After {93} boiling, the urine is cooled in a\r\nstream of cold water and brought to its original bulk with distilled\r\nwater; 8 gm. of lead carbonate are then added to neutralize the acid.\r\nThe fluid is allowed to stand a few minutes and then filtered through\r\nwell-moistened fine-grained filter-paper until perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--\"Pancreatic reaction\" flasks fitted with\r\nfunnel condensers on a sand-bath (Robson and Cammidge).]\r\n\r\n(2) The filtrate is shaken up with 8 gm. powdered tribasic lead\r\nacetate and filtered. The excess of lead is then removed by passing\r\nhydrogen sulphid gas through the fluid or by shaking well with 4 gm.\r\nfinely powdered sodium sulphate, heating to boiling, cooling to as low\r\na temperature as possible in a stream of water, and filtering as\r\nbefore until perfectly clear.\r\n\r\n(3) Ten cubic centimeters of the filtrate are then made up to 17 c.c.\r\nwith distilled water, and added to a mixture of 0.8 gm. phenylhydrazin\r\nhydrochlorate, 2 gm. powdered sodium acetate, and 1 c.c. 50 per cent.\r\nacetic acid in a small flask {94} with funnel condenser. This is\r\nboiled on a sand-bath for ten minutes, and filtered while hot through\r\nfilter-paper moistened with hot water into a test-tube with a 15 c.c.\r\nmark. Should the filtrate not reach this mark, make up to 15 c.c. with\r\nhot distilled water. Allow to cool slowly.\r\n\r\n(4) In well-marked cases of pancreatitis a yellow precipitate appears\r\nwithin a few hours; in milder cases, it may not appear for twelve\r\nhours. The microscope shows this sediment to consist of \"long, light\r\nyellow, flexible, hair-like crystals arranged in sheaves, which, when\r\nirrigated with 33 per cent. sulphuric acid, melt away and disappear in\r\nten to fifteen seconds after the acid first touches them\" (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Improved \"pancreatic reaction.\" Crystals\r\nobtained from a case of chronic pancreatitis with gall-stones in the\r\ncommon duct (X200) (from a photo by P. J. Cammidge).]\r\n\r\n(5) To exclude traces of glucose which might be overlooked in the\r\npreliminary examination a control test should be carried out in the\r\nsame manner with omission of step (1).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{95} 8. Drugs.--The effect of various drugs upon the color of the\r\nurine has been mentioned (p. 50). Most poisons are eliminated in the\r\nurine, but their detection is more properly discussed in works upon\r\ntoxicology. A few drugs which are of interest to the practitioner, and\r\nwhich can be detected by comparatively simple methods, are mentioned\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAcetanilid and Phenacetin.--The urine is evaporated by gentle heat to\r\nabout half its volume, boiled for a few minutes with about one-fifth\r\nits volume of strong hydrochloric acid, and shaken out with ether. The\r\nether is evaporated, the residue dissolved in water, and the following\r\ntest applied: To about 10 c.c. are added a few cubic centimeters of 3\r\nper cent. phenol, followed by a weak solution of chromium trioxid\r\n(chromic acid) drop by drop. The fluid assumes a red color, which\r\nchanges to blue when ammonia is added. If the urine is very pale,\r\nextraction with ether may be omitted.\r\n\r\nAntipyrin.--This drug gives a dark-red color when a few drops of 10\r\nper cent. ferric chlorid are added to the urine. The color does not\r\ndisappear upon boiling, which excludes diacetic acid.\r\n\r\nArsenic.--_Reinsch's Test_.--Add to the urine in a test-tube or small\r\nflask about one-seventh its volume of hydrochloric acid, introduce a\r\npiece of bright copper-foil about one-eighth-inch square, and boil for\r\nseveral minutes. If arsenic be present, a dark-gray film is deposited\r\nupon the copper. The test is more delicate if the urine be\r\nconcentrated by slow evaporation. This test is well known and is\r\nwidely used, but is not so reliable as the following:\r\n\r\n_Gutzeit's Test_.--In a large test-tube place a little {96}\r\narsenic-free zinc, and add 5 to 10 c.c. pure dilute hydrochloric acid\r\nand a few drops of iodin solution (Gram's solution will answer), then\r\nadd 5 to 10 c.c. of the urine. At once cover the mouth of the tube\r\nwith a filter-paper cap moistened with saturated aqueous solution of\r\nsilver nitrate (1:1). If arsenic be present, the paper quickly becomes\r\nlemon-yellow, owing to formation of a compound of silver arsenid and\r\nsilver nitrate, and turns black when touched with a drop of water. To\r\nmake sure that the reagents are arsenic-free, the paper cap may be\r\napplied for a few minutes before the urine is added.\r\n\r\nAtropin will cause dilatation of the pupil when a few drops of the\r\nurine are placed in the eye of a cat or rabbit.\r\n\r\nBromids can be detected by acidifying about 10 c.c. of the urine with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, adding a few drops of fuming nitric acid and a\r\nfew cubic centimeters of chloroform, and shaking. In the presence of\r\nbromin the chloroform, which settles to the bottom, assumes a yellow\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nIodin--from ingestion of iodids or absorption from iodoform\r\ndressings--is tested for in the same way as the bromids, the\r\nchloroform assuming a pink to reddish-violet color. To detect traces,\r\na large quantity of urine should be rendered alkaline with sodium\r\ncarbonate and greatly concentrated by evaporation before testing.\r\n\r\nLead.--No simple method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the traces\r\nof lead which occur in the urine in chronic poisoning. Of the more\r\nsensitive methods, that of Arthur Lederer is probably best suited to\r\nthe practitioner:\r\n\r\nIt is essential that all apparatus used be lead-free. Five hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of the urine are acidified {97} with 70 c.c. pure\r\nsulphuric acid, and heated in a beaker or porcelain dish. About 20 to\r\n25 gm. of potassium persulphate are added a little at a time. This\r\nshould decolorize the urine, leaving it only slightly yellow. If it\r\ndarkens upon heating, a few more crystals of potassium persulphate are\r\nadded, the burner being first removed to prevent boiling over; if it\r\nbecomes cloudy, a small amount of sulphuric acid is added. It is then\r\nboiled until it has evaporated to 250 c.c. or less. After cooling, an\r\nequal volume of alcohol is added, and the mixture allowed to stand in\r\na cool place for four or five hours, during which time all the lead\r\nwill be precipitated as insoluble sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is then filtered through a small, close-grained\r\nfilter-paper (preferably an ashless, quantitative filter-paper), and\r\nany sediment remaining in the beaker or dish is carefully washed out\r\nwith alcohol and filtered. A test-tube is placed underneath the\r\nfunnel; a hole is punched through the tip of the filter with a small\r\nglass rod, and all the precipitate (which may be so slight as to be\r\nscarcely visible) washed down into the test-tube with a jet of\r\ndistilled water from a wash-bottle, using as little water as possible.\r\nTen cubic centimeters will usually suffice. This fluid is then heated,\r\nadding crystals of sodium acetate until it becomes perfectly clear. It\r\nnow contains all the lead of the 500 c.c. urine in the form of lead\r\nacetate. It is allowed to cool, and hydrogen sulphid gas is passed\r\nthrough it for about five minutes. The slightest yellowish-brown\r\ndiscoloration indicates the presence of lead. A very slight\r\ndiscoloration can be best seen when looked at from above. For\r\ncomparison, the gas may be passed through a test-tube containing an\r\nequal amount of distilled water. The quantity of lead can be {98}\r\ndetermined by comparing the discoloration with that produced by\r\npassing the gas through lead acetate (sugar of lead) solutions of\r\nknown strength. One part of lead acetate crystals contains 0.54 part\r\nof lead. Hydrogen sulphid is easily prepared in the simple apparatus\r\nshown in Fig. 30. A small quantity of iron sulphid is placed in the\r\ntest-tube; a little dilute hydrochloric acid is added; the cork is\r\nreplaced; and the delivery tube is inserted to the bottom of fluid to\r\nbe tested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--A simple hydrogen sulphid generator.]\r\n\r\nMercury.--Traces can be detected in the urine for a considerable time\r\nafter the use of mercury compounds by ingestion or inunction.\r\n\r\nAbout a liter of urine is acidified with 10 c.c. hydrochloric acid,\r\nand a small piece of copper-foil or gauze is introduced. This is\r\ngently heated for an hour, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.\r\nThe metal is then removed, and washed successively with very dilute\r\nsodium hydroxid solution, alcohol, and ether. When dry, {99} it is\r\nplaced in a long, slender test-tube, and the lower portion of the tube\r\nis heated to redness. If mercury be present, it will volatilize and\r\ncondense in the upper portion of the tube as small, shining globules\r\nwhich can be seen with a hand-magnifier or low power of the\r\nmicroscope. If, now, a crystal of iodin be dropped into the tube and\r\ngently heated, the mercury upon the side of the tube is changed first\r\nto the yellow iodid and later to the red iodid which are recognized by\r\ntheir color.\r\n\r\nMorphin.--Add sufficient ammonia to the urine to render it distinctly\r\nammoniacal, and shake thoroughly with a considerable quantity of pure\r\nacetic ether. Separate the ether and evaporate to dryness. To a little\r\nof the residue in a watch-glass or porcelain dish add a few drops of\r\nformaldehyd-sulphuric acid, which has been freshly prepared by adding\r\none drop of formalin to 1 c.c. pure concentrated sulphuric acid. If\r\nmorphin be present, this will produce a purple-red color, which\r\nchanges to violet, blue-violet, and finally nearly pure blue.\r\n\r\nPhenol.--As has been stated, the urine following phenol poisoning\r\nturns olive-green and then brownish-black upon standing. Tests are of\r\nvalue in recognizing poisoning from ingestion and in detecting\r\nabsorption from carbolized dressings.\r\n\r\nThe urine is acidulated with hydrochloric acid and distilled. To the\r\nfirst few cubic centimeters of distillate is added 10 per cent.\r\nsolution of ferric chlorid drop by drop. The presence of phenol causes\r\na deep amethyst-blue color, as in Uffelmann's test for lactic acid.\r\n\r\nPhenolphthalein, which is now being used as a cathartic under the name\r\nof _purgen_, gives a bright pink color when the urine is rendered\r\nalkaline with caustic soda.\r\n\r\n{100} Quinin.--A considerable quantity of the urine is rendered\r\nalkaline with ammonia and extracted with ether; the ether is\r\nevaporated, and a portion of the residue dissolved in about twenty\r\ndrops of dilute alcohol. The alcoholic solution is acidulated with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, a drop of an alcoholic solution of iodin\r\n(tincture of iodin diluted about ten times) is added, and the mixture\r\nis warmed. Upon cooling, an iodin compound of quinin (herapathite)\r\nwill separate out in the form of a microcrystalline sediment of green\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the residue may be dissolved in a little dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. This solution will show a characteristic blue\r\nfluorescence when quinin is present.\r\n\r\nResinous drugs cause a white precipitate like that of albumin when\r\nstrong nitric acid is added to the urine. This is dissolved by\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nSalicylates, salol, and similar drugs give a bluish-violet color,\r\nwhich disappears upon heating, upon addition of a few drops of 10 per\r\ncent. ferric chlorid solution. When the quantity of salicylates is\r\nsmall, the urine may be acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted\r\nwith ether, the ether evaporated, and the test applied to an aqueous\r\nsolution of the residue.\r\n\r\nTannin and its compounds appear in the urine as gallic acid, and the\r\nurine becomes greenish-black (inky, if much gallic acid be present)\r\nwhen treated with a solution of ferric chlorid.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nA careful microscopic examination will often detect structures of\r\ngreat diagnostic importance in urine which seems perfectly clear, and\r\nfrom which only very slight {101} sediment can be obtained with the\r\ncentrifuge. Upon the other hand, cloudy urines with abundant sediment\r\nare often shown by the microscope to contain nothing of clinical\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nSince the nature of the sediment soon changes, the urine must be\r\nexamined while fresh, preferably within six hours after it is voided.\r\nThe sediment is best obtained by means of the centrifuge. If a\r\ncentrifuge is not available, the urine may be allowed to stand in a\r\nconical test-glass for six to twenty-four hours after adding some\r\npreservative (p. 48). The \"torfuge\" (Fig. 31) is said to be a very\r\nsatisfactory substitute for the centrifuge, and is readily portable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Wetherill's torfuge.]\r\n\r\nA small amount of the sediment should be transferred to a slide by\r\nmeans of a pipet. It is very important to do this properly. The best\r\npipet is a small glass tube which has been drawn out at one end to a\r\ntip with rather small opening. The tube or glass containing the\r\nsediment is held on a level with the eye, the larger end of the pipet\r\nis closed with the index-finger, which must be dry, and the {102} tip\r\nis carried down into the sediment. By carefully loosening the finger,\r\nbut not entirely removing it, a small amount of the sediment is then\r\nallowed to run slowly into the pipet. Slightly rotating the pipet will\r\naid in accomplishing this. After wiping off the urine which adheres to\r\nthe outside, a drop from the pipet is placed upon a clean slide. A\r\nhair is then placed in the drop and a large cover-glass applied. Many\r\nworkers use no cover. This offers a thicker layer and larger area of\r\nurine, the chance of finding scanty structures being proportionately\r\nincreased. It has the disadvantage that any jarring of the room (as by\r\npersons walking about) sets the microscopic field into vibratory\r\nmotion and makes it impossible to see anything clearly; and, since it\r\ndoes not allow of the use of high-power objectives, one cannot examine\r\ndetails as one often wishes to do. A large cover-glass with a hair\r\nbeneath it avoids these disadvantages, and gives enough urine to find\r\nany structures which are present in sufficient number to have clinical\r\nsignificance, provided other points in the technic have been right. It\r\nis best, however, to examine several drops; and, when the sediment is\r\nabundant, drops from the upper and lower portions should be examined\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nIn examining urinary sediments microscopically no fault is so common,\r\nnor so fatal to good results, as improper illumination (see Figs. 2\r\nand 3), and none is so easily corrected. The light must be central and\r\nvery subdued. The two-thirds objective should be used as a finder,\r\nwhile the one-sixth is reserved for examining details.\r\n\r\nIt is well to emphasize that _the most common errors which result in\r\nfailure to find important structures, when present, are lack of care\r\nin transferring the sediment to the slide, too strong illumination,\r\nand too great magnification_.\r\n\r\n{103} In order to distinguish between similar structures it is often\r\nnecessary to watch the effect upon them of certain reagents. This is\r\nespecially true of the various unorganized sediments. They very\r\nfrequently cannot be identified from their form alone. With the\r\nstructures still in focus, a drop of the reagent may be placed at one\r\nedge of the cover-glass and drawn underneath it by the suction of a\r\npiece of blotting-paper touched to the opposite edge; or a small drop\r\nof the reagent and of the urine may be placed close together upon a\r\nslide and a cover gently lowered over them. As the two fluids mingle,\r\nthe effect upon various structures may be seen.\r\n\r\nUrinary sediments may be studied under three heads: A. Unorganized\r\nsediments. B. Organized sediments. C. Extraneous structures.\r\n\r\nA. UNORGANIZED SEDIMENTS\r\n\r\nIn general these have little diagnostic or prognostic significance.\r\nMost of them are substances normally present which have been\r\nprecipitated from solution either because present in excessive amounts\r\nor, more frequently, because of some alteration in the urine (as in\r\nreaction, concentration, etc.) which may be purely physiologic,\r\ndepending upon changes in diet or habits. Various substances are\r\nalways precipitated during decomposition, which may take place either\r\nwithin or without the body. Unorganized sediments may be classified\r\naccording to the reaction of the urine in which they are most likely\r\nto be found:\r\n\r\nIn acid urine: uric acid, amorphous urates, sodium urate, calcium\r\noxalate, leucin and tyrosin, cystin, and fat-globules. Uric acid, the\r\nurates, and calcium oxalate are {104} the common deposits of acid\r\nurines; the others are less frequent, and depend less upon the\r\nreaction of the urine.\r\n\r\nIn alkaline urine: phosphates, calcium carbonate, and ammonium urate.\r\n\r\nOther crystalline sediments (Fig. 32) which are rare and require no\r\nfurther mention are: calcium sulphate, cholesterin, hippuric acid,\r\nhematoidin, fatty acids, and indigo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Unusual urinary crystals (drawn from various\r\nauthors): 1, Calcium sulphate (colorless); 2, cholesterin (colorless);\r\n3, hippuric acid (colorless); 4, hematoidin (brown); 5, fatty acids\r\n(colorless); 6, indigo (blue); 7, sodium urate (yellowish).]\r\n\r\n1. In Acid Urine.--(1) Uric-acid Crystals.--These crystals are the red\r\ngrains--\"gravel\" or \"red sand\"--which are often seen adhering to the\r\nsides and bottom of a vessel containing urine. Microscopically, they\r\nare yellow or reddish-brown crystals, which differ greatly in size and\r\nshape. The most characteristic forms (Plate III and Fig. 33) are\r\n\"whetstones\"; roset-like clusters of prisms and whetstones; and\r\nrhombic plates, which have usually a paler color than the other forms\r\nand are sometimes colorless. Recognition of the crystals depends less\r\nupon their shape than upon their color, the reaction of the urine, and\r\nthe facts that they are soluble in caustic soda solution and insoluble\r\nin hydrochloric or acetic acid. {105} When ammonia is added, they\r\ndissolve and crystals of ammonium urate appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III. Uric-acid crystals with amorphous urates\r\n(after Peyer).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Forms of uric acid: 1, Rhombic plates; 2,\r\nwhetstone forms; 3, 3, quadrate forms; 4, 5, prolonged into points; 6,\r\n8, rosets; 7, pointed bundles; 9, barrel forms precipitated by adding\r\nhydrochloric acid to urine (Ogden).]\r\n\r\nA deposit of uric-acid crystals has no significance unless it occurs\r\nbefore or very soon after the urine is voided. Every urine, if kept\r\nacid, will in time deposit its uric acid. Factors which favor an early\r\ndeposit are high acidity, diminished urinary pigments, and excessive\r\nexcretion of uric acid. The chief clinical interest of the crystals\r\nlies in their tendency to form calculi, owing to the readiness with\r\nwhich they collect about any solid object. Their presence in the\r\nfreshly voided urine in clusters of crystals suggests stone in the\r\nkidney or bladder, especially if blood is also present (see Fig. 62).\r\n\r\n(2) Amorphous Urates.--These are chiefly urates of {106} sodium and\r\npotassium which are thrown out of solution as a yellow or red\r\n\"brick-dust\" deposit. In pale urines this sediment is almost white. It\r\ndisappears upon heating. A deposit of amorphous urates is very common\r\nin concentrated and strongly acid urines, especially in cold weather,\r\nand has no clinical significance. Under the microscope it appears as\r\nfine yellowish granules, often so abundant as to obscure all other\r\nstructures (Plate III). In such cases the urine should be warmed\r\nbefore examining. Amorphous urates are readily soluble in caustic soda\r\nsolutions. When treated with hydrochloric or acetic acid they slowly\r\ndissolve and rhombic crystals of uric acid appear.\r\n\r\nRarely, sodium urate occurs in crystalline form--slender prisms,\r\narranged in fan- or sheaf-like structures (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n(3) Calcium Oxalate.--Characteristic of calcium oxalate are colorless,\r\nglistening, octahedral crystals, giving the appearance of small\r\nsquares crossed by two intersecting diagonal lines--the so-called\r\n\"envelop crystals\" (Fig. 47). They vary greatly in size, being\r\nsometimes so small as to seem mere points of light with medium-power\r\nobjectives. Unusual forms, which, however, seldom occur except in\r\nconjunction with the octahedra, are colorless dumb-bells, spheres, and\r\nvariations of the octahedra (Fig. 34). The spheres might be mistaken\r\nfor globules of fat or red blood-corpuscles. Crystals of calcium\r\noxalate are insoluble in acetic acid or caustic soda. They are\r\ndissolved by strong hydrochloric acid, and recrystallize as octahedra\r\nupon addition of ammonia. They are sometimes encountered in alkaline\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Various forms of calcium oxalate crystals\r\n(Ogden).]\r\n\r\nThe crystals are commonly found in the urine after ingestion of\r\nvegetables rich in oxalic acid, as tomatoes, {107} spinach, asparagus,\r\nand rhubarb. They have no definite significance pathologically. They\r\noften appear in digestive disturbances, in neurasthenia, and when the\r\noxidizing power of the system is diminished. Like uric acid, their\r\nchief clinical interest lies in their tendency to form calculi, and\r\ntheir presence in fresh urine, together with evidences of renal or\r\ncystic irritation, should be viewed with suspicion, particularly if\r\nthey are clumped in small masses.\r\n\r\n(4) Leucin and Tyrosin.---Crystals are deposited only when the\r\nsubstances are present in considerable amount. When present in smaller\r\namount, they will usually be deposited if a drop of the urine be\r\nslowly evaporated upon a slide. They generally appear together, and\r\nare of rare occurrence, usually indicating severe fatty destruction of\r\nthe liver, such as occurs in acute yellow atrophy and\r\nphosphorus-poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe crystals cannot be identified from their morphology alone, since\r\nother substances, notably calcium phosphate (Fig. 38) and ammonium\r\nurate, may take similar or identical forms.\r\n\r\n_Leucin crystals_ (Fig. 35) are slightly yellow, oily-looking spheres,\r\nmany of them with radial and concentric {108} striations. Some may be\r\nmerged together in clusters. They are not soluble in hydrochloric acid\r\nnor in ether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Leucin spheres and tyrosin needles\r\n(Stengel).]\r\n\r\n_Tyrosin_ crystallizes in very fine colorless needles, usually\r\narranged in sheaves, with a marked constriction at the middle (Fig.\r\n35). It is soluble in ammonia and hydrochloric acid, but not in acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Cystin crystals from urine of patient with\r\ncystin calculus (X250).]\r\n\r\n(5) Cystin crystals are colorless, highly refractive, rather thick,\r\nhexagonal plates with well-defined edges. They lie either singly or\r\nsuperimposed to form more or less irregular clusters (Fig. 36). Uric\r\nacid sometimes {109} takes this form and must be excluded. Cystin is\r\nsoluble in hydrochloric acid, insoluble in acetic; it is readily\r\nsoluble in ammonia and recrystallizes upon addition of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nCystin crystals are very rare, and when found, point to cystin\r\ncalculus.\r\n\r\n(6) Fat-globules.--Fat appears in the urine as highly refractive\r\nglobules of various sizes, frequently very small. These globules are\r\neasily recognized from the fact that they are stained black by osmic\r\nacid and red by Sudan III. The stain may be applied upon the slide, as\r\nalready described (p. 103). Osmic acid should be used in 1 per cent.\r\naqueous solution; Sudan III in saturated solution in 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nFat in the urine is usually a contamination from unclean vessels,\r\noiled catheters, etc. A very small amount may be present after\r\ningestion of large quantities of cod-liver oil or other fats. In fatty\r\ndegeneration of the kidney, as in phosphorus-poisoning and chronic\r\nparenchymatous nephritis, fat-globules are commonly seen, both free in\r\nthe urine and embedded in cells and tube-casts.\r\n\r\nIn _chyluria_, or admixture of chyle with the urine as a result of\r\nrupture of a lymph-vessel, minute droplets of fat are so numerous as\r\nto give the urine a milky appearance. Chyluria occurs most frequently\r\nas a symptom of infection by _Filaria sanguinis hominis_.\r\n\r\n2. In Alkaline Urine.--(1) Phosphates.--While most common in alkaline\r\nurine, phosphates are sometimes deposited in neutral or feebly acid\r\nurines. The usual forms are: (_a_) Ammoniomagnesium phosphate\r\ncrystals; (_b_) acid calcium phosphate crystals; and (_c_) amorphous\r\nphosphates. All are readily soluble in acetic acid.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Ammoniomagnesium Phosphate Crystals_.--They are {110} the\r\ncommon \"triple phosphate\" crystals, which are generally easily\r\nrecognized (Figs. 37 and 63, and Plate IV). They are colorless, except\r\nwhen bile-stained. Their usual form is some modification of the prism,\r\nwith oblique ends. Most typical are the well-known \"coffin-lid\" and\r\n\"hip-roof\" forms. The long axis of the hip-roof crystal is often so\r\nshortened that it resembles the envelop crystal of calcium oxalate. It\r\ndoes not, however, have the same luster; this, and its solubility in\r\nacetic acid, will always prevent confusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Various forms of triple-phosphate crystals\r\n(Ogden).]\r\n\r\nWhen rapidly deposited, as by artificial precipitation, triple\r\nphosphate often takes feathery, star- or leaf-like forms. These\r\ngradually develop into the more common prisms. X-forms may be produced\r\nby partial solution of prisms.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Acid Calcium Phosphate Crystals_.--In feebly add, neutral, or\r\nfeebly alkaline urines acid calcium phosphate, wrongly called \"neutral\r\ncalcium phosphate,\" is not infrequently deposited in the form of\r\ncolorless prisms {111} arranged in stars and rosets (Fig. 38, 1). The\r\nindividual prisms are usually slender, with one beveled, wedge-like\r\nend, but are sometimes needle-like. They may sometimes take forms\r\nresembling tyrosin (Fig. 38, 2), calcium sulphate, or hippuric acid,\r\nbut are readily distinguished by their solubility in acetic acid.\r\n\r\nCalcium phosphate often forms large, thin, irregular, usually\r\ngranular, colorless plates, which are easily recognized (Fig. 38, 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Crystals of calcium phosphate: 1, Common form\r\n(copied from Rieder's Atlas); 2, needles resembling tyrosin (drawn\r\nfrom nature); 3, large, irregular plates (from nature).]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Amorphous Phosphates_.--The earthy phosphates are thrown out of\r\nsolution in most alkaline and many neutral urines as a white,\r\namorphous sediment, which may be mistaken for pus macroscopically.\r\nUnder the microscope the sediment is seen to consist of numerous\r\ncolorless granules, distinguished from amorphous urates by their\r\ncolor, their solubility in acetic acid, and the reaction of the urine.\r\n\r\nThe various phosphatic deposits frequently occur together. They are\r\nsometimes due to excessive excretion of phosphoric acid, but usually\r\nmerely indicate that the urine has become, or is becoming, alkaline.\r\n\r\n{112} (2) Calcium carbonate may sometimes be mingled with the\r\nphosphate deposits, usually as amorphous granules, or, more rarely, as\r\ncolorless spheres and dumb-bells, Fig. 39, which are soluble in acetic\r\nacid with gas-formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Indistinct crystalline sediment (dumb-bell\r\ncrystals) of calcium carbonate. Similar crystals are formed by calcium\r\noxalate and calcium sulphate (after Funke).]\r\n\r\n(3) Ammonium Urate Crystals.--This is the only urate deposited in\r\nalkaline urine. It forms opaque yellow crystals, usually in the form\r\nof spheres (Plate IV, and Fig. 63), which are often covered with fine\r\nor coarse spicules, \"thorn-apple crystals.\" Sometimes dumb-bells,\r\ncompact sheaves of fine needles, and irregular rhizome forms are seen\r\n(Fig. 40). Upon addition of acetic acid they dissolve, and rhombic\r\nplates of uric acid appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Crystals of ammonium urate (one-half of the\r\nforms copied from Rieder's Atlas, the others from nature).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV. Sediment of alkaline fermentation (after\r\nHofmann and Ultzmann).]\r\n\r\n{113} These crystals occur only when ammonia is present in excess.\r\nThey are generally found along with the phosphates in decomposing\r\nurine and have no clinical significance.\r\n\r\nB. ORGANIZED SEDIMENTS\r\n\r\nThe principal organized structures in urinary sediments are:\r\ntube-casts; epithelial cells; pus-corpuscles; red blood-corpuscles;\r\nspermatozoa; bacteria; and animal parasites. They are much more\r\nimportant than the unorganized sediments just considered.\r\n\r\n1. Tube-casts.--These interesting structures are albuminous molds of\r\nthe uriniferous tubules. Their presence in the urine probably always\r\nindicates some pathologic change in the kidney, although this change\r\nmay be very slight or transitory. Large numbers may be present in\r\ntemporary irritations and congestions. _They do not in themselves,\r\ntherefore, imply organic disease of the kidney._ They probably occur\r\nonly in urine which contains, or has recently contained, albumin.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not possible to draw a sharp dividing-line between the\r\ndifferent varieties, casts may be classified as: (1) Hyaline casts;\r\n(2) waxy casts; (3) granular casts; (4) fatty casts; (5) casts\r\ncontaining organized structures--(_a_) epithelial casts; (_b_)\r\nblood-casts; (_c_) pus-casts; (_d_) bacterial casts. As will be seen,\r\npractically all varieties are modifications of the hyaline.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the different varieties is more readily understood\r\nif one considers their mode of formation. Albuminous material, the\r\nsource and nature of which are not definitely known, probably enters\r\nthe lumen of a uriniferous tubule in a fluid or plastic state. It\r\nthere hardens into a mold, which, when washed out by the {114} urine,\r\nretains the shape of the tubule, and contains within its substance\r\nwhatever structures and débris were lying free within the tubule or\r\nwere loosely attached to its wall. If the tubule be small and have its\r\nusual lining of epithelium, the cast will be narrow; if it be large or\r\nentirely denuded of epithelium, the cast will be broad. A cast,\r\ntherefore, indicates the condition of the tubule in which it is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe search for casts must be carefully made. The urine must be fresh,\r\nsince hyaline casts soon dissolve when it becomes alkaline. It should\r\nbe thoroughly centrifugalized. When the sediment is abundant, casts,\r\nbeing light structures, will be found near the top. In cystitis, where\r\ncasts may be entirely hidden by the pus, the bladder should be\r\nirrigated to remove as much of the pus as possible and the next urine\r\nexamined. In order to prevent solution of the casts the urine, if\r\nalkaline, must be rendered acid by previous administration of boric\r\nacid or other drugs.\r\n\r\n(1) Hyaline Casts.--Typically, these are colorless, homogeneous,\r\nsemitransparent, cylindric structures, with parallel sides and usually\r\nrounded ends. Not infrequently they are more opaque or show a few\r\ngranules or an occasional cell, either adhering to them or contained\r\nwithin their substance. Generally they are straight or curved; less\r\ncommonly, convoluted. Their length and breadth vary greatly: they are\r\nsometimes so long as to extend across several fields of a medium-power\r\nobjective, but are usually much shorter; in breadth, they vary from\r\none to seven or eight times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.\r\n(See Figs. 2, 41, 42, and 46.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Hyaline casts showing fat-droplets and\r\nleukocytes (obj. one-sixth) (Boston).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Various kinds of casts: _a_, Hyaline and\r\nfinely granular cast; _b_, finely granular cast; _c_, coarsely\r\ngranular cast; _d_, brown granular cast; _e_, granular cast with\r\nnormal and abnormal blood adherent; _f_, granular cast with renal\r\ncells adherent; _g_, granular cast with fat and a fatty renal cell\r\nadherent (Ogden).]\r\n\r\nHyaline casts are the least significant of all the casts, {115} and\r\noccur in many slight and transitory conditions. Small numbers are\r\ncommon following ether anesthesia, in fevers, after excessive\r\nexercise, and in congestions and irritations of the kidney. They are\r\nalways present, and are usually stained yellow when the urine contains\r\nmuch bile. While they are found in all organic diseases of the kidney,\r\nthey {116} are most important in chronic interstitial nephritis. Here\r\nthey are seldom abundant, but their constant presence is the most\r\nreliable urinary sign of the disease. Small areas of chronic\r\ninterstitial change are probably responsible for the few hyaline casts\r\nso frequently found in the urine of elderly persons.\r\n\r\nVery broad hyaline casts commonly indicate complete desquamation of\r\nthe tubular epithelium, such as occurs in the late stages of\r\nnephritis.\r\n\r\n(2) Waxy Casts.--Like hyaline casts, these are homogeneous when\r\ntypical, but frequently contain a few granules or an occasional cell.\r\nThey are much more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are usually\r\nshorter and broader, with irregular, broken ends, and sometimes appear\r\nto be segmented. They are grayish or colorless, and have a dull waxy\r\nlook, as if cut from paraffin (Figs. 43 and 61). They are sometimes\r\ncomposed of material which gives the amyloid reactions. Waxy casts are\r\nfound in most advanced cases of nephritis, where they are an\r\nunfavorable sign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Waxy casts (upper part of figure). Fatty and\r\nfat-bearing casts (lower part of figure) (from Greene's \"Medical\r\nDiagnosis\").]\r\n\r\nCasts which resemble waxy casts but have a distinctly {117} yellow\r\ncolor, as if cut from beeswax (so-called \"fibrinous casts\"), are often\r\nseen in acute nephritis. They have less serious significance than the\r\ntrue waxy variety.\r\n\r\n(3) Granular Casts.--These are merely hyaline casts in which numerous\r\ngranules are embedded (Figs. 42, 44, 46, and 61).\r\n\r\n_Finely granular casts_ contain many fine granules, are usually\r\nshorter, broader, and more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are\r\nmore conspicuous. Their color is grayish or pale yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Granular and fatty casts and two compound\r\ngranular cells (Stengel).]\r\n\r\n_Coarsely granular casts_ contain larger granules and are darker in\r\ncolor than the finely granular, being often dark brown owing to\r\npresence of altered blood-pigment. They are usually shorter and more\r\nirregular in outline, and more frequently have irregularly broken\r\nends.\r\n\r\n(4) Fatty Casts.--Small droplets of fat may at times be seen in any\r\nvariety of cast. Those in which the droplets are numerous are called\r\nfatty casts (Figs. 43 and 44). The fat-globules are not difficult to\r\nrecognize. Staining with osmic acid or Sudan (p. 109) will remove any\r\ndoubt as to their nature.\r\n\r\n{118} The granules and fat-droplets seen in casts are products of\r\nepithelial degeneration. Granular and fatty casts, therefore, always\r\nindicate partial or complete disintegration of the renal epithelium.\r\nThe finely granular variety is the least significant, and is found\r\nwhen the epithelium is only moderately affected. Coarsely granular,\r\nand especially fatty casts, indicate a serious parenchymatous\r\nnephritis.\r\n\r\n(5) Casts Containing Organized Structures.--Cells and other structures\r\nare frequently seen adherent to a cast or embedded within it. (See\r\nFigs. 41 and 42). When numerous, they give name to the cast.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Epithelial casts_ contain epithelial cells from the renal\r\ntubules. They always imply desquamation of epithelium, which rarely\r\noccurs except in parenchymatous inflammations (Figs. 60 and 61).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Red blood-corpuscles and blood-casts\r\n(courtesy of Dr. A. Scott) (obj. one-sixth) (Boston).]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Blood-casts_ contain red blood-corpuscles, usually much\r\ndegenerated (Figs. 45 and 60). They always indicate hemorrhage into\r\nthe tubules, which is most {119} common in acute nephritis or an acute\r\nexacerbation of a chronic nephritis.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Pus-casts_ (see Fig. 62), composed almost wholly of\r\npus-corpuscles, are uncommon, and point to a chronic suppurative\r\nprocess in the kidney.\r\n\r\n(_d_) True _bacterial casts_ are rare. They indicate a septic\r\ncondition in the kidney. Bacteria may permeate a cast after the urine\r\nis voided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Hyaline and granular casts, mucous threads,\r\nand cylindroids. There are also a few epithelial cells from the\r\nbladder (Wood).]\r\n\r\nThe structures most likely to be mistaken for casts are:\r\n\r\n(1) Mucous Threads.--Mucus frequently appears in the form of long\r\nstrands which slightly resemble hyaline casts (Fig. 46). They are,\r\nhowever, more ribbon-like, have less well-defined edges, and usually\r\nshow faint longitudinal striations. Their ends taper to a point or are\r\nsplit or curled upon themselves, and are never evenly rounded, as is\r\ncommonly the case with hyaline casts.\r\n\r\n(2) Cylindroids.--This name is sometimes given to the {120} mucous\r\nthreads just described, but is more properly applied to certain\r\npeculiar structures more nearly allied to casts. They resemble hyaline\r\ncasts in structure, but differ in being broader at one end and\r\ntapering to a slender tail, which is often twisted or curled upon\r\nitself (Fig. 46). They frequently occur in the urine along with\r\nhyaline casts, and have no definite pathologic significance.\r\n\r\n(3) Masses of amorphous urates or phosphates or very small crystals\r\n(Fig. 47), which accidentally take a cylindric form, or shreds of\r\nmucus covered with granules, closely resemble granular casts.\r\nApplication of gentle heat or appropriate chemicals will serve to\r\ndifferentiate them. When urine contains both mucus and granules, large\r\nnumbers of these \"pseudo-casts,\" all lying in the same direction, can\r\nbe produced by slightly moving the cover-glass from side to side. It\r\nis possible--as in urate infarcts of infants--for urates to be molded\r\ninto cylindric bodies within the renal tubules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Calcium-oxalate crystals, showing a\r\npseudo-cast of small crystals (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n(4) Hairs and fibers of wool, cotton, etc. These could be mistaken for\r\ncasts only by beginners. One can easily {121} become familiar with\r\ntheir appearance by suspending them in water and examining with the\r\nmicroscope (Fig. 57).\r\n\r\n(5) Hyphæ of molds are not infrequently mistaken for hyaline casts.\r\nTheir higher degree of refraction, their jointed or branching\r\nstructure, and the accompanying spores will differentiate them (Fig.\r\n58).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Renal epithelium from nephritic urine: _a_,\r\nPolyhedral epithelium in nephritis of scarlet fever; _b_ and _c_,\r\ndifferent grades of fatty degeneration in renal epithelium in chronic\r\nnephritis (X400) (after Bizzozero).]\r\n\r\n2. Epithelial Cells.--A few cells from various parts of the urinary\r\ntract occur in every urine. A marked increase indicates some\r\npathologic condition at the site of their origin. It is sometimes, but\r\nby no means always, possible to locate their source from their form.\r\nAny epithelial cell may be so granular from degenerative changes that\r\nthe nucleus is obscured. They are usually divided into three groups:\r\n\r\n(1) Small, round, or polyhedral cells are about the size of\r\npus-corpuscles, or a little larger, with a single round nucleus. Such\r\ncells may come from the deeper layers of any part of the urinary\r\ntract. They are uncommon in normal urine. When they are dark in color,\r\nvery granular, and contain a comparatively large nucleus, they\r\nprobably come from the renal tubules, but their origin in the kidney\r\nis not proved unless they are found embedded in casts. Renal cells are\r\nabundant in parenchymatous nephritis, especially the acute form. They\r\nare nearly always fatty--most markedly so in chronic parenchymatous\r\nnephritis, where their {122} substance is sometimes wholly replaced by\r\nfat-droplets (\"compound granule cells\") (see Figs. 44, 48, 60, and\r\n61).\r\n\r\n(2) Irregular cells are considerably larger than the preceding. They\r\nare round, pear-shaped, or spindle-shaped, or may have tail-like\r\nprocesses, and are hence named large round, pyriform, spindle, or\r\ncaudate cells respectively. Each contains a round or oval distinct\r\nnucleus. Their usual source is the deeper layers of the urinary tract,\r\nespecially of the bladder. Caudate forms come most commonly from the\r\npelvis of the kidney (see Figs. 49, _b_, 50, 62, and 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Epithelial cells from urethra and bladder:\r\n_a_, Squamous cells from superficial layers; _b_, irregular cells from\r\ndeeper layers (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n(3) Squamous or pavement cells are large flat cells, each with a\r\nsmall, distinct, round or oval nucleus (Fig. 49, _a_). They are\r\nderived from the superficial layers of the ureters, bladder, urethra,\r\nor vagina. Those from the bladder are generally rounded, while those\r\nfrom the vagina are larger, thinner, and more angular. Great numbers\r\nof these vaginal cells, together with pus-corpuscles, may be present\r\nwhen leukorrhea exists.\r\n\r\n{123} [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Caudate epithelial cells from pelvis of\r\nkidney (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n3. Pus-corpuscles.--A very few leukocytes are present in normal urine.\r\nThey are more abundant when mucus is present. An excess of leukocytes,\r\nmainly of the polymorphonuclear variety, with albumin, constitutes\r\n_pyuria_--pus in the urine.\r\n\r\nWhen at all abundant, pus forms a white sediment resembling amorphous\r\nphosphates macroscopically. Under the microscope the corpuscles appear\r\nas very granular cells, about twice the diameter of a red\r\nblood-corpuscle (Figs. 51 and 63). In freshly voided urine many\r\nexhibit ameboid motion, assuming irregular outlines. Each contains one\r\nirregular nucleus or several small, rounded nuclei. The nuclei are\r\nobscured or entirely hidden by the granules, but may be brought\r\nclearly into view by running a little acetic acid under the\r\ncover-glass. This enables one to easily distinguish pus-corpuscles\r\nfrom small round epithelial cells, which resemble them in size, but\r\nhave a single, rather large, round nucleus.\r\n\r\nPyuria indicates suppuration in some part of the urinary {124}\r\ntract--urethritis, cystitis, pyelitis, etc.--or may be due to\r\ncontamination from the vagina, in which case many vaginal epithelial\r\ncells will also be present. In general, the source of the pus can be\r\ndetermined only by the accompanying structures (epithelia, casts) or\r\nby the clinical signs.\r\n\r\nA fairly accurate idea of the quantity of pus from day to day may be\r\nhad by shaking the urine thoroughly and counting the number of\r\ncorpuscles per cubic millimeter upon the Thoma-Zeiss blood-counting\r\nslide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Pus-corpuscles: _a_, As ordinarily seen; _b_,\r\nameboid corpuscles; _c_, showing the action of acetic acid (Ogden).]\r\n\r\n4. Red Blood-corpuscles.--Urine which contains blood is always\r\nalbuminous. Very small amounts do not alter its macroscopic\r\nappearance. Larger amounts alter it considerably. Blood from the\r\nkidneys is generally intimately mixed with the urine and gives it a\r\nhazy reddish or brown color. When from the lower urinary tract, it is\r\nnot so intimately mixed, and settles more quickly to the bottom, the\r\ncolor is brighter, and small clots are often present.\r\n\r\nRed blood-corpuscles are not usually difficult to recognize with the\r\nmicroscope. When very fresh, they have a normal appearance, being\r\nyellowish discs of uniform size (normal blood). When they have been in\r\nthe urine any {125} considerable time, their hemoglobin may be\r\ndissolved out, and they then appear as faint colorless circles or\r\n\"shadow cells\" (abnormal blood), and are more difficult to see (Fig.\r\n52; see also Figs. 45 and 60). They are apt to be swollen in dilute\r\nand crenated in concentrated urines. The microscopic findings may be\r\ncorroborated by chemic tests for hemoglobin, although the microscope\r\nmay show a few red corpuscles when the chemic tests are negative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Blood-corpuscles: _a_, Normal; _b_, abnormal\r\n(Ogden).]\r\n\r\nWhen not due to contamination from menstrual discharge, blood in the\r\nurine, or _hematuria_, is always pathologic. Blood comes from the\r\nkidney tubules in severe hyperemia, in some forms of nephritis, and in\r\nrenal tuberculosis and malignant disease. The finding of blood-casts\r\nis the only certain means of diagnosing the kidney as its source.\r\nBlood comes from the pelvis of the kidney in renal calculus (Fig. 62),\r\nand is then usually intermittent, small in amount, and accompanied by\r\na little pus and perhaps crystals of the substance forming the stone.\r\nConsiderable hemorrhages from the bladder may occur in vesical\r\ncalculus, tuberculosis, and newgrowths. Small amounts of blood\r\ngenerally accompany acute cystitis.\r\n\r\n5. Spermatozoa are generally present in the urine of men after\r\nnocturnal emissions, after epileptic convulsions, and in\r\nspermatorrhea. They may be found in the urine of both sexes following\r\ncoitus. They are easily recognized {126} from their characteristic\r\nstructure (Fig. 53). The one-sixth objective should be used, with\r\nsubdued light and careful focusing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Spermatozoa in urine (Ogden).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Micrococcus ureæ (after von Jaksch).]\r\n\r\n6. Bacteria.--Normal urine is free from bacteria in the bladder, but\r\nbecomes contaminated in passing through the urethra. Various\r\nnon-pathogenic bacteria, notably _Micrococcus ureæ_ (Fig. 54), are\r\nalways present in decomposing urine. In suppurations of the urinary\r\ntract pus-producing organisms may be found. In many infectious\r\ndiseases the specific germs may be eliminated in {127} the urine\r\nwithout producing any local lesion. Typhoid bacilli have been known to\r\npersist for months and even years after the attack.\r\n\r\nBacteria produce a cloudiness which will not clear upon filtration.\r\nThey are easily seen with the one-sixth objective in the routine\r\nmicroscopic examination. Ordinarily, no attempt is made to identify\r\nany but the tubercle bacillus and the gonococcus.\r\n\r\nTubercle bacilli are nearly always present in the urine when\r\ntuberculosis exists in any part of the urinary tract, but are often\r\ndifficult to find, especially when the urine contains little or no\r\npus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDetection of Tubercle Bacilli in Urine.--The urine should be obtained\r\nby catheter after careful cleansing of the parts.\r\n\r\n(1) Centrifugalize thoroughly, after dissolving any sediment of urates\r\nor phosphates by gentle heat or acetic acid. Pour off the supernatant\r\nfluid, add water, and centrifugalize again. Addition of one or two\r\nvolumes of alcohol will favor centrifugalization by lowering the\r\nspecific gravity.\r\n\r\n(2) Make thin smears of the sediment, adding a little egg-albumen if\r\nnecessary to make the smear adhere to the glass; dry, and fix in the\r\nusual way.\r\n\r\n(3) Stain with carbol-fuchsin, steaming, for at least three minutes.\r\n\r\n(4) Wash in water, and then in 20 per cent. nitric acid until only a\r\nfaint pink color remains.\r\n\r\n(5) Wash in water.\r\n\r\n(6) Soak in alcohol fifteen minutes or longer. This decolorizes the\r\nsmegma bacillus (p. 35), which is often present in the urine, and\r\nmight easily be mistaken for the tubercle bacillus. It is unlikely,\r\nhowever, to be present in catheterized specimens. It is always safest\r\nto soak the smear in alcohol for several {128} hours or over night,\r\nsince some strains of the smegma bacillus are very resistant.\r\n\r\n(7) Wash in water.\r\n\r\n(8) Apply Löffler's methylene-blue solution one-half minute.\r\n\r\n(9) Rinse in water, dry between filter-papers, and examine with the\r\none-twelfth objective.\r\n\r\nWhen the bacilli are scarce, the following method may be tried. It is\r\napplicable also to other fluids. If the fluid is not albuminous, add a\r\nlittle egg-albumen. Coagulate the albumen by gentle heat and\r\ncentrifugalize. The bacilli will be carried down with the albumen.\r\nSeparate the albumen, mix with artificial gastric juice (for\r\npreparation of which see test for pepsin, p. 222), and set in an\r\nincubator or warm place until digested. Finally, centrifugalize and\r\nstain as described above. The bacilli do not stain so well as in the\r\nordinary methods.\r\n\r\nA careful search of many smears may be necessary to find the bacilli.\r\nThey usually lie in clusters (see Plate V). Failure to find them in\r\nsuspicious cases should be followed by inoculation of guinea-pigs;\r\nthis is the court of last appeal, and must also be sometimes resorted\r\nto in order to exclude the smegma bacillus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn gonorrhoea gonococci are sometimes found in the sediment, but more\r\ncommonly in the \"gonorrheal threads,\" or \"floaters.\" In themselves,\r\nthese threads are by no means diagnostic of gonorrhea. Detection of\r\nthe gonococcus is described later (p. 264).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V. Tubercle bacilli in urinary sediment; X800\r\n(Ogden).]\r\n\r\n7. Animal parasites are rare in the urine. Hooklets and scolices of\r\n_Tænia echinococcus_ (Fig. 55) and embryos of _Filaria sanguinis\r\nhominis_ have been met. In Africa the ova, and even adults, of\r\n_Distoma hæmatobium_ are common, accompanying \"Egyptian hematuria.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--1, Scolex of tænia echinococcus, showing\r\ncrown of hooklets; 2, scolex and detached hooklets (obj. one-sixth)\r\n(Boston).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Embryo of \"vinegar eel\" in urine, from\r\ncontamination; length, 340 µ; width, 15 µ. An epithelial cell from\r\nbladder and three leukocytes are also shown (studied with Dr. J. A.\r\nWilder).]\r\n\r\nOther parasites, most of which are described in Chapter VI, may be\r\npresent from contaminations. A worm {129} which is especially\r\ninteresting is _Anguillula aceti_, the \"vinegar eel.\" This is\r\ngenerally present in the sediment of table vinegar, and may reach the\r\nurine through use of vinegar in vaginal douches, or through\r\ncontamination of the bottle in which the urine is contained. It has\r\nbeen mistaken for _Strongyloides intestinalis_ and for _Filaria\r\nsanguinis hominis_. It closely resembles the former in {130} both\r\nadult and embryo stages. The young embryos have about the same length\r\nas filaria embryos, but are nearly twice as broad and the intestinal\r\ncanal is easily seen (compare Figs. 56 and 107).\r\n\r\nC. EXTRANEOUS STRUCTURES\r\n\r\nThe laboratory worker must familiarize himself with the microscopic\r\nappearance of the more common of the numerous structures which may be\r\npresent from accidental contamination (Fig. 57).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Extraneous matters found in urine: _a_,\r\nFlax-fibers; _b_, cotton-fibers; _c_, feathers; _d_, hairs; _e_,\r\npotato-starch; _f_, rice-starch granules; _g_, wheat-starch; _h_,\r\nair-bubbles; _i_, muscular tissue; _k_, vegetable tissue; _l_,\r\noil-globules.]\r\n\r\n_Yeast-cells_ are smooth, colorless, highly refractive, spheric or\r\novoid cells. They sometimes reach the size of {131} a leukocyte, but\r\nare generally smaller (see Fig. 88, _l_). They might be mistaken by\r\nthe inexperienced for red blood-corpuscles, fat-droplets, or the\r\nspheric crystals of calcium oxalate, but are distinguished by the\r\nfacts that they are not of uniform size; that they tend to adhere in\r\nshort chains; that small buds may often be seen adhering to the larger\r\ncells; and that they do not give the hemoglobin test, are not stained\r\nby osmic acid or Sudan but are colored brown by Lugol's solution, and\r\nare insoluble in acids and alkalis. Yeast-cells multiply rapidly in\r\ndiabetic urine, and may reach the bladder and multiply there.\r\n\r\n_Mold fungi_ (Fig. 58) are characterized by refractive, jointed, or\r\nbranched rods (hyphæ), often arranged in a network, and by highly\r\nrefractive, spheric or ovoid spores. They are common in urine which\r\nhas stood exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Aspergillus from urine (Boston).]\r\n\r\n_Fibers_ of wool, cotton, linen, or silk, derived from towels, the\r\nclothing of the patient, or the dust in the air are present in almost\r\nevery urine. _Fat-droplets_ are most frequently derived from unclean\r\nbottles or oiled catheters. _Starch-granules_ may reach the urine from\r\ntowels, the {132} clothing, or dusting-powders. They are recognized by\r\ntheir concentric striations and their blue color with iodin solution.\r\n_Lycopodium granules_ (Fig. 59) may also reach the urine from\r\ndusting-powders. They might be mistaken for the ova of parasites.\r\n_Bubbles of air_ are often confusing to beginners, but are easily\r\nrecognized after once being seen. _Scratches_ and _flaws_ in the glass\r\nof slide or cover are likewise a common source of confusion to\r\nbeginners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Granules of lycopodium (Saxe).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE URINE IN DISEASE\r\n\r\nIn this section the characteristics of the urine in those diseases\r\nwhich produce distinctive urinary changes will be briefly reviewed.\r\n\r\n1. Renal Hyperemia.--_Active hyperemia_ is usually an early stage of\r\nacute nephritis, but may occur independently as a result of temporary\r\nirritation. The urine is generally decreased in quantity, highly\r\ncolored, and strongly acid. Albumin is always present--usually in\r\ntraces only, but sometimes in considerable amount for a day or two.\r\nThe sediment contains a few hyaline and finely granular casts and an\r\noccasional red blood-cell. In very severe hyperemia the urine\r\napproaches that of acute nephritis.\r\n\r\n{133} [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Sediment from acute hemorrhagic\r\nnephritis: Red blood-corpuscles; leukocytes; renal cells not fattily\r\ndegenerated; epithelial and blood-casts (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Sediment from chronic parenchymatous\r\nnephritis: hyaline (with cells attached), waxy, brown granular, fatty,\r\nand epithelial casts; fattily degenerated renal cells; and a few white\r\nand red blood-corpuscles (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n_Passive hyperemia_ occurs most commonly in diseases of the heart and\r\nliver and in pregnancy. The quantity of urine is somewhat low and the\r\ncolor high, except in pregnancy. Albumin is present in small amount\r\nonly. The sediment contains a very few hyaline or finely granular\r\n{134} casts. In pregnancy the amount of albumin should be carefully\r\nwatched, as any considerable quantity, and especially a rapid\r\nincrease, strongly suggests approaching eclampsia.\r\n\r\n2. Nephritis.--The various degenerative and inflammatory conditions\r\ngrouped under the name of nephritis have certain features in common.\r\nThe urine in all cases contains albumin and tube-casts, and in all\r\nwell-marked cases shows a decrease of normal solids, especially of\r\nurea and the chlorids. The characteristics of the different forms are\r\nwell shown in the table on opposite page, modified from Hill.\r\n\r\n{135}                   THE URINE IN NEPHRITIS\r\n\r\n        PHYSICAL.

Renal Tuberculosis.--The urine is pale, usually cloudy. The\r\nquantity may not be affected, but is apt to be increased. In early\r\ncases the reaction is faintly acid and there are traces of albumin and\r\na few renal cells. In advanced cases the urine is alkaline, has an\r\noffensive odor, and is irritating to the bladder. Albumin in varying\r\namounts is always present. Pus is nearly always present, though\r\nfrequently not abundant. It is generally intimately mixed with the\r\nurine, and does not settle so quickly as the pus of cystitis. Casts,\r\nthough present, are rarely abundant, and are obscured by the pus.\r\nSmall amounts of blood are common. Tubercle bacilli are nearly always\r\npresent, although animal inoculation may be necessary to detect them.\r\n\r\n4. Renal Calculus.--The urine is usually somewhat concentrated, with\r\nhigh color and strongly acid reaction. Small amounts of albumin and a\r\nfew casts may be present as a result of kidney irritation. Blood is\r\nfrequently present, especially in the daytime and after severe\r\nexercise. Crystals of the substance composing the calculus--uric {136}\r\nacid, calcium oxalate, cystin--may often be found. The presence of a\r\ncalculus generally produces pyelitis, and variable amounts of pus then\r\nappear, the urine remaining acid in reaction.\r\n\r\n5. Pyelitis.--In pyelitis the urine is slightly acid, and contains a\r\nsmall or moderate amount of pus, together with many spindle and\r\ncaudate epithelial cells. Pus-casts may appear if the process extends\r\nup into the kidney tubules (see Fig. 62). Albumin is always present,\r\nand its amount, in proportion to the amount of pus, is decidedly\r\ngreater than is found in cystitis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Sediment from calculous pyelitis: numerous\r\npus-corpuscles, red blood-corpuscles, and caudate and irregular\r\nepithelial cells; a combination of hyaline and pus-cast; and a few\r\nuric-acid crystals (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n6. Cystitis.---In _acute_ and _subacute_ cases the urine is acid and\r\ncontains a variable amount of pus, with many epithelial cells from the\r\nbladder--chiefly large round, pyriform, and rounded squamous cells.\r\nRed blood-corpuscles are often numerous.\r\n\r\nIn _chronic_ cases the urine is generally alkaline. It is {137} pale\r\nand cloudy from the presence of pus, which is abundant and settles\r\nreadily into a viscid sediment. The sediment usually contains abundant\r\namorphous phosphates and crystals of triple phosphate and ammonium\r\nurate. Vesical epithelium is common. Numerous bacteria are always\r\npresent (see Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Sediment from cystitis (chronic): numerous\r\npus-corpuscles, epithelial cells from the bladder, and bacteria; a few\r\nred blood-corpuscles and triple phosphate and ammonium urate crystals\r\n(Jakob).]\r\n\r\n7. Vesical Calculus, Tumors, and Tuberculosis.--These conditions\r\nproduce a chronic cystitis, with its characteristic urine. Blood,\r\nhowever, is more frequently present and more abundant than in ordinary\r\ncystitis. With neoplasms, especially, considerable hemorrhages are apt\r\nto occur. Particles of the tumor are sometimes passed with the urine.\r\nNo diagnosis can be made from the presence of isolated tumor cells. In\r\ntuberculosis tubercle bacilli can generally be detected.\r\n\r\n8. Diabetes Insipidus.--Characteristic of this disease is the\r\ncontinued excretion of very large quantities of pale, watery urine,\r\ncontaining neither albumin nor sugar. The {138} specific gravity\r\nvaries between 1.001 and 1.005. The daily output of solids, especially\r\nurea, is increased.\r\n\r\n9. Diabetes Mellitus.--The quantity of urine is very large. The color\r\nis generally pale, while the specific gravity is nearly always\r\nhigh--1.030 to 1.050, very rarely below 1.020. The presence of glucose\r\nis the essential feature of the disease. The amount of glucose is\r\noften very great, sometimes exceeding 8 per cent., while the total\r\nelimination may exceed 500 gm. in twenty-four hours. It may be absent\r\ntemporarily. Acetone is generally present in advanced cases. Diacetic\r\nacid may be present, and usually warrants an unfavorable prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{139}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Considerations.--The blood consists of a fluid of\r\ncomplicated and variable composition, the plasma, in which are\r\nsuspended great numbers of microscopic structures: viz., red\r\ncorpuscles, white corpuscles, blood-platelets, and blood-dust.\r\n\r\n_Red corpuscles_, or _erythrocytes_, are biconcave discs, red when\r\nviewed by reflected light or in thick layer, and straw-colored when\r\nviewed by transmitted light or in thin layer. They give the blood its\r\nred color. They are cells which have been highly differentiated for\r\nthe purpose of carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. This is\r\naccomplished by means of an iron-bearing proteid, hemoglobin, which\r\nthey contain. In the lungs hemoglobin forms a loose combination with\r\noxygen, which it readily gives up when it reaches the tissues. Normal\r\nerythrocytes do not contain nuclei. They are formed from preëxisting\r\nnucleated cells in the bone-marrow.\r\n\r\n_White corpuscles_, or _leukocytes_, are less highly differentiated\r\ncells. There are several varieties. They all contain nuclei, and most\r\nof them contain granules which vary in size and staining properties.\r\nThey are formed in the bone-marrow and lymphoid tissues.\r\n\r\n_Blood-platelets_, or _blood-plaques_, are colorless or slightly\r\nbluish, spheric or ovoid bodies, about one-third or one-half the\r\ndiameter of an erythrocyte. Their structure, nature, and origin have\r\nnot been definitely determined.\r\n\r\n{140} The _blood-dust of Müller_ consists of fine granules which have\r\nvibratory motion. Little is known of them. It has been suggested that\r\nthey are granules from disintegrated leukocytes.\r\n\r\n_Coagulation_ consists essentially in the transformation of\r\nfibrinogen, one of the proteins of the blood, into fibrin by means of\r\na ferment derived from disintegration of the leukocytes. The resulting\r\ncoagulum is made up of a meshwork of fibrin fibrils with entangled\r\ncorpuscles and plaques. The clear, straw-colored fluid which is left\r\nafter separation of the coagulum is called _blood-serum_. Normally,\r\ncoagulation takes place in two to eight minutes after the blood leaves\r\nthe vessels. It is frequently desirable to determine the coagulation\r\ntime. The simplest method is to place a drop of blood upon a perfectly\r\nclean slide, and to draw a needle through it at half-minute intervals.\r\nWhen the clot is dragged along by the needle, coagulation has taken\r\nplace. This method is probably sufficient for ordinary clinical work.\r\nFor very accurate results the method of Russell and Brodie, for which\r\nthe reader is referred to the larger text-books, is recommended.\r\nCoagulation is notably delayed in hemophilia and icterus and after\r\nadministration of citric acid. It is hastened by administration of\r\ncalcium chlorid.\r\n\r\nFor most clinical examinations only one drop of blood is required.\r\nThis may be obtained from the lobe of the ear, the palmar surface of\r\nthe tip of the finger, or, in the case of infants, the plantar surface\r\nof the great toe. With nervous children the lobe of the ear is\r\npreferable, as it prevents their seeing what is being done. An\r\nedematous or congested part should be avoided. The site should be well\r\nrubbed with alcohol to remove dirt and epithelial {141} débris and to\r\nincrease the amount of blood in the part. After allowing sufficient\r\ntime for the circulation to equalize, the skin is punctured with a\r\nblood lancet (of which there are several patterns upon the market) or\r\nsome substitute, as a Hagedorn needle, aspirating needle, trocar, or a\r\npen with one of its nibs broken off. Nothing is more unsatisfactory\r\nthan an ordinary sewing-needle. The lancet should be cleaned with\r\nalcohol before and after using, but need not be sterilized. If the\r\npuncture be made with a _firm, quick stroke_, it is practically\r\npainless. The first drop of blood which appears should be wiped away,\r\nand the second used for examination. The blood should not be pressed\r\nout, since this dilutes it with serum from the tissues; but moderate\r\npressure some distance above the puncture is allowable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Daland's blood-lancet.]\r\n\r\nWhen a larger amount of blood is required, it may be obtained with a\r\nsterile hypodermic syringe from one of the veins at the elbow.\r\n\r\nClinical study of the blood may be discussed under the following\r\nheads: I. Hemoglobin. II. Enumeration of erythrocytes. III. Color\r\nindex. IV. Enumeration of leukocytes. V. Enumeration of plaques. VI.\r\nStudy of stained blood. VII. Blood parasites. VIII. Serum reactions.\r\nIX. Tests for recognition of blood. X. Special blood pathology.\r\n\r\n\r\n{142} I. HEMOGLOBIN\r\n\r\nHemoglobin is an iron-bearing proteid. It is found only within the red\r\ncorpuscles, and constitutes about 90 per cent. of their weight. The\r\nactual amount of hemoglobin is never estimated clinically: it is the\r\nrelation which the amount present bears to the normal which is\r\ndetermined. Thus the expression, \"50 per cent. hemoglobin,\" when used\r\nclinically, means that the blood contains 50 per cent. of the normal.\r\nTheoretically, the normal would be 100 per cent., but with the methods\r\nof estimation in general use the blood of healthy persons ranges from\r\n85 to 105 per cent.; these figures may, therefore, be taken as normal.\r\n\r\n_Increase of hemoglobin_, or _hyperchromemia_, is uncommon, and is\r\nprobably more apparent than real. It accompanies an increase in number\r\nof erythrocytes, and may be noted in change of residence from a lower\r\nto a higher altitude; in poorly compensated heart disease with\r\ncyanosis; in concentration of the blood from any cause, as the severe\r\ndiarrhea of cholera; and in \"idiopathic polycythemia.\"\r\n\r\n_Decrease of hemoglobin_, or _oligochromemia_, is very common and\r\nimportant. It is the most striking feature of the secondary anemias\r\n(p. 204). Here the hemoglobin loss may be slight or very great. In\r\nmild cases a slight decrease of hemoglobin is the only blood change\r\nnoted. In very severe cases, especially in repeated hemorrhages,\r\nmalignant disease, and infection by the worms uncinaria and\r\nbothriocephalus latus, hemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Hemoglobin\r\nis always diminished, and usually very greatly, in chlorosis,\r\npernicious anemia, and leukemia.\r\n\r\n{143} _Estimation of Hemoglobin_.--There are many methods, but none is\r\nentirely satisfactory. Those which are most widely used are here\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Von Fleischl's hemoglobinometer: _a_, Stand;\r\n_b_, narrow wedge-shaped piece of colored glass fitted into a frame\r\n(_c_), which passes under the chamber; _d_, hollow metal cylinder,\r\ndivided into two compartments, which holds the blood and water; _e_,\r\nplaster-of-Paris plate from which the light is reflected through the\r\nchamber; _f_, screw by which the frame containing the graduated\r\ncolored glass is moved; _g_, capillary tube to collect the blood; _h_,\r\npipet for adding the water; _i_, opening through which may be seen the\r\nscale indicating percentage of hemoglobin.]\r\n\r\n(1) Von Fleischl Method.--The apparatus consists of a stand somewhat\r\nlike the base and stage of a microscope (Fig. 65). Under the stage is\r\na movable bar of colored glass, shading from pale pink at one end to\r\ndeep red at the other. The frame in which this bar is held is marked\r\nwith a scale of hemoglobin percentages corresponding to the different\r\nshades of red. By means of a rack and pinion, the color-bar can be\r\nmoved from end to end beneath a round opening in the center of the\r\nstage. A small metal cylinder, which has a glass bottom and which is\r\ndivided vertically into two equal compartments, can be placed over the\r\nopening in the stage so that one of its {144} compartments lies\r\ndirectly over the color-bar. Accompanying the instrument are a number\r\nof short capillary tubes in metal handles.\r\n\r\nHaving punctured the finger-tip or lobe of the ear as already\r\ndescribed, wipe off the first drop of blood, and from the second fill\r\none of the capillary tubes. Hold the tube horizontally, and touch its\r\ntip to the drop of blood, which will readily flow into it if it be\r\nclean and dry. Avoid getting any blood upon its outer surface. With a\r\nmedicine-dropper, rinse the blood from the tube into one of the\r\ncompartments of the cylinder, using distilled water, and mix well.\r\nFill both compartments level full with distilled water, and place the\r\ncylinder over the opening in the stage so that the compartment which\r\ncontains only water lies directly over the bar of colored glass.\r\n\r\nIn a dark room, with the light from a candle reflected up through the\r\ncylinder, move the color-bar along with a jerking motion until both\r\ncompartments have the same depth of color. The number upon the scale\r\ncorresponding to the portion of the color-bar which is now under the\r\ncylinder gives the percentage of hemoglobin. While comparing the two\r\ncolors, place the instrument so that they will fall upon the right and\r\nleft halves of the retina, rather than upon the upper and lower\r\nhalves; and protect the eye from the light with a cylinder of paper or\r\npasteboard. After use, clean the metal cylinder with water, and wash\r\nthe capillary tube with water, alcohol, and ether, successively.\r\nResults with this instrument are accurate to within about 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nA recent modification of the von Fleischl apparatus by Miescher gives\r\nan error which need not exceed 1 per cent. It is, however, better\r\nadapted to laboratory use than to the needs of the practitioner.\r\n\r\n(2) The Sahli hemoglobinometer (Fig. 66) is an improved form of the\r\nwell known Gowers instrument. It consists of a hermetically sealed\r\ncomparison tube containing a 1 per cent. solution of acid hematin, a\r\ngraduated test-tube of the same {145} diameter, and a pipet of 20\r\nc.mm. capacity. The two tubes are held in a black frame with a white\r\nground-glass back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Sahli's hemoglobinometer.]\r\n\r\nPlace a few drops of decinormal hydrochloric acid solution in the\r\ngraduated tube. Obtain a drop of blood and draw it into the pipet to\r\nthe 20 c.mm. mark. Wipe off the tip of the pipet, blow its contents\r\ninto the hydrochloric acid solution in the tube, and rinse well. In a\r\nfew minutes the hemoglobin is changed to acid hematin. Place the two\r\ntubes in the compartments of the frame, and dilute the fluid with\r\nwater drop by drop, mixing after each addition, until it has exactly\r\nthe same color as the comparison tube. The graduation corresponding to\r\nthe surface of the fluid then indicates the {146} percentage of\r\nhemoglobin. Decinormal hydrochloric acid solution may be prepared with\r\nsufficient accuracy for this purpose by adding 15 c.c. of the\r\nconcentrated acid to 985 c.c. distilled water. A little chloroform\r\nshould be added as a preservative.\r\n\r\nThis method is very satisfactory in practice, and is accurate to\r\nwithin 5 per cent. The comparison tube is said to keep its color\r\nindefinitely, but, unfortunately, not all the instruments upon the\r\nmarket are well standardized.\r\n\r\n(3) Dare's hemoglobinometer (Fig. 67) differs from the others in using\r\nundiluted blood. The blood is allowed to flow by capillarity into the\r\nslit between two small plates of glass. It is then placed in the\r\ninstrument and compared with different portions of a circular disc of\r\ncolored glass. The reading must be made quickly, before clotting takes\r\nplace. This instrument is easy to use, and is one of the most\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Dare's hemoglobinometer.]\r\n\r\n(4) Hammerschlag Method.--This is an indirect method which depends\r\nupon the fact that the percentage of hemoglobin varies directly with\r\nthe specific gravity of the blood. It yields fairly accurate results\r\nexcept in leukemia, where the large number of leukocytes disturbs the\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nMix chloroform and benzol in a urinometer tube so that {147} the\r\nspecific gravity of the mixture is near the probable specific gravity\r\nof the blood. Add a drop of blood by means of a pipet of small\r\ncaliber. If the drop floats near the surface, add a little benzol; if\r\nit sinks to the bottom, add a little chloroform. When it remains\r\nstationary near the middle, the mixture has the same specific gravity\r\nas the blood. Take the specific gravity with a urinometer, and obtain\r\nthe corresponding percentage of hemoglobin from the following table:\r\n\r\n   SPECIFIC     HEMOGLOBIN       SPECIFIC     HEMOGLOBIN\r\n   GRAVITY.      PER CENT.       GRAVITY.      PER CENT.\r\n  1.033-1.035      25-30        1.048-1.050      55-65\r\n  1.035-1.038      30-35        1.050-1.053      65-70\r\n  1.038-1.040      35-40        1.053-1.055      70-75\r\n  1.040-1.045      40-45        1.055-1.057      75-85\r\n  1.045-1.048      45-55        1.057-1.060      85-95\r\n\r\nFor accurate results with this method, care and patience are demanded.\r\nThe following precautions must be observed:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The two fluids must be well mixed after each addition of\r\nchloroform or benzol. Close the tube with the thumb and invert several\r\ntimes. Should this cause the drop of blood to break up into very small\r\nones, adjust the specific gravity as accurately as possible with\r\nthese, and test it with a fresh drop.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The drop of blood must not be too large; it must not contain an\r\nair-bubble, it must not adhere to the side of the tube, and it must\r\nnot remain long in the fluid.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The urinometer must be standardized for the chloroform-benzol\r\nmixture. Most urinometers give a reading two or three degrees too\r\nhigh, owing to the low surface tension. Make a mixture such that a\r\ndrop of distilled water will remain suspended in it (_i.e._, with a\r\nspecific gravity of 1.000) and correct the urinometer by this.\r\n\r\n(5) Tallquist Method.--The popular Tallquist hemoglobinometer consists\r\nsimply of a book of small sheets of absorbent paper and a carefully\r\nprinted scale of colors (Fig. 68).\r\n\r\nTake up a large drop of blood with the absorbent paper, {148} and when\r\nthe humid gloss is leaving, compare the stain with the color scale.\r\nThe color which it matches gives the percentage of hemoglobin. Except\r\nin practised hands, this method is accurate only to within 10 or 20\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Tallquist's hemoglobin scale.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the methods given, the physician should select the one which best\r\nmeets his needs. With any method, practice is essential to accuracy.\r\nThe von Fleischl has long been the standard instrument, but has lately\r\nfallen into some disfavor. For accurate work the best instruments are\r\nthe von Fleischl-Miescher and the Dare. They are, however, expensive,\r\nand it is doubtful whether they are enough more accurate than the\r\nSahli instrument to justify the difference in cost. The latter is\r\nprobably the most satisfactory for the practitioner, provided a {149}\r\nwell-standardized color-tube is obtained. The specific gravity method\r\nis very useful when special instruments are not at hand. The Tallquist\r\nscale is so inexpensive and so convenient that it should be used by\r\nevery physician at the bedside and in hurried office work; but it\r\nshould not supersede the more accurate methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ENUMERATION OF ERYTHROCYTES\r\n\r\nIn health there are about 5,000,000 red corpuscles per cubic\r\nmillimeter of blood. Normal variations are slight. The number is\r\ngenerally a little less--about 4,500,000--in women.\r\n\r\n_Increase of red corpuscles_, or _polycythemia_, is unimportant. There\r\nis a decided increase following change of residence from a lower to a\r\nhigher altitude, averaging about 50,000 corpuscles for each 1000 feet,\r\nbut frequently much greater. The increase, however, is not permanent.\r\nIn a few months the erythrocytes return to nearly their original\r\nnumber. Three views are offered in explanation: (_a_) Concentration of\r\nthe blood, owing to increased evaporation from the skin; (_b_)\r\nstagnation of corpuscles in the peripheral vessels, because of lowered\r\nblood-pressure; (_c_) new-formation of corpuscles, this giving a\r\ncompensatory increase of aëration surface.\r\n\r\nPathologically, polycythemia is uncommon. It may occur in: (_a_)\r\nconcentration of the blood from severe watery diarrhea; (_b_) chronic\r\nheart disease, especially the congenital variety, with poor\r\ncompensation and cyanosis; and (_c_) idiopathic polycythemia, which is\r\nconsidered to be an independent disease, and is characterized by\r\ncyanosis, blood counts of 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, hemoglobin 120 to\r\n150 per cent., and a normal number of leukocytes.\r\n\r\n{150} _Decrease of red corpuscles_, or _oligocythemia_. Red corpuscles\r\nand hemoglobin are commonly decreased together, although usually not\r\nto the same extent.\r\n\r\nOligocythemia occurs in all but the mildest symptomatic anemias. The\r\nblood count varies from near the normal in moderate cases down to\r\n1,500,000 in very severe cases. There is always a decrease of red\r\ncells in chlorosis, but it is often slight, and is relatively less\r\nthan the decrease of hemoglobin. Leukemia gives a decided\r\noligocythemia, the average count being about 3,000,000. The greatest\r\nloss of red cells occurs in pernicious anemia, where counts below\r\n1,000,000 are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Thoma-Zeiss hemocytometer: _a_, Slide used in\r\ncounting; _b_, sectional view; _d_, red pipet; _e_, white pipet.]\r\n\r\nThe most widely used and most satisfactory instrument for counting the\r\ncorpuscles is that of Thoma-Zeiss. The hematocrit is not to be\r\nrecommended for accuracy, since in anemia, where blood counts are most\r\nimportant, the red cells vary greatly in size and probably also in\r\nelasticity. {151} The hematocrit is, however, useful in determining\r\nthe relative volume of corpuscles and plasma, and seems to be gaining\r\nin favor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Ordinary ruling of counting chamber, showing\r\nred corpuscles in left upper corner.]\r\n\r\nThe Thoma-Zeiss instrument consists of two pipets for diluting the\r\nblood and a counting chamber (Fig. 69). The counting chamber is a\r\nglass slide with a square platform in the middle. In the center of the\r\nplatform is a circular opening, in which is set a small circular disc\r\nin such a manner that it is surrounded by a \"ditch,\" and that its\r\nsurface is exactly one-tenth of a millimeter below the surface of the\r\nsquare platform. Upon this disc is ruled a square millimeter,\r\nsubdivided into 400 small squares. Each fifth row of small squares has\r\ndouble ruling for convenience in counting (Fig. 70). A thick {152}\r\ncover-glass, ground perfectly plane, accompanies the counting chamber.\r\nOrdinary cover-glasses are of uneven surface, and should not be used\r\nwith this instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, when the cover-glass is in place upon the\r\nplatform, there is a space exactly one-tenth of a millimeter thick\r\nbetween it and the disc; and that, therefore, the square millimeter\r\nruled upon the disc forms the base of a space holding exactly\r\none-tenth of a cubic millimeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Method of drawing blood into the pipet\r\n(Boston).]\r\n\r\nTechnic.--To count the red corpuscles, use the pipet with 101 engraved\r\nabove the bulb. It must be clean and dry. Obtain a drop of blood as\r\nalready described. Suck blood into the pipet to the mark 0.5 or 1.\r\nShould the blood go beyond the mark, draw it back by touching the tip\r\nof the pipet to a moistened handkerchief. Quickly wipe off the blood\r\nadhering to the tip, plunge it into the diluting fluid, and suck the\r\nfluid up to the mark 101, slightly rotating the pipet meanwhile. This\r\ndilutes the blood 1:200 or 1:100, according to the amount of blood\r\ntaken. Except in cases of severe {153} anemia, a dilution of 1:200 is\r\npreferable. Close the ends of the pipet with the fingers, and shake\r\nvigorously until the blood and diluting fluid are well mixed.\r\n\r\nWhen it is not convenient to count the corpuscles at once, place a\r\nheavy rubber band around the pipet so as to close the ends, inserting\r\na small piece of rubber-cloth or other tough, non-absorbent material\r\nif necessary to prevent the tip from punching through the rubber. It\r\nmay be kept thus for twenty-four hours or longer.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to make the count, mix again thoroughly by shaking; blow\r\ntwo or three drops of the fluid from the pipet, wipe off its tip, and\r\nthen place a small drop (the proper size can be learned only by\r\nexperience) upon the disc of the counting chamber. Adjust the cover\r\nimmediately. Hold it by diagonal corners above the drop of fluid so\r\nthat a third corner touches the slide and rests upon the edge of the\r\nplatform. Place a finger upon this corner, and, by raising the finger,\r\nallow the cover to fall quickly into place. If the cover be properly\r\nadjusted, faint concentric lines of the prismatic colors--Newton's\r\nrings--can be seen between it and the platform when the slide is\r\nviewed obliquely. They indicate that the two surfaces are in close\r\napposition. If they do not appear at once, slight pressure upon the\r\ncover may bring them out. Failure to obtain them is usually due to\r\ndirty slide or cover--both must be perfectly clean and free from dust.\r\nThe drop placed upon the disc must be of such size that, when the\r\ncover is adjusted, it nearly or quite covers the disc, and that none\r\nof it runs over into the \"ditch.\" There should be no bubbles upon the\r\nruled area.\r\n\r\nAllow the corpuscles to settle for a few minutes, and then examine\r\nwith a low power to see that they are evenly distributed. If they are\r\nnot _evenly distributed over the whole disc_, the counting chamber\r\nmust be cleaned and a new drop placed in it.\r\n\r\nProbably the most satisfactory objective for counting is the special\r\none-sixth for blood work already mentioned. To {154} understand the\r\nprinciple of counting, it is necessary to remember that the large\r\nsquare (400 small squares) represents a capacity of one-tenth of a\r\ncubic millimeter. Find the number of corpuscles in the large square,\r\nmultiply by 10 to find the number in 1 c.mm. of the diluted blood, and\r\nfinally, by the dilution, to find the number in 1 c.mm. of undiluted\r\nblood. Instead of actually counting all the corpuscles, it is\r\ncustomary to count those in only a limited number of small squares,\r\nand from this to calculate the number in the large square.\r\n\r\nIn practice a convenient procedure is as follows: _With a dilution of\r\n1:200, count the cells in 80 small squares, and to the sum add 4\r\nciphers; with dilution of 1:100, count 40 small squares and add 4\r\nciphers._ Thus, if with 1:200 dilution, 450 corpuscles were counted,\r\nthe total count would be 4,500,000 per c.mm. This method is\r\nsufficiently accurate for all clinical purposes, provided the\r\ncorpuscles are evenly distributed and two drops from the pipet be\r\ncounted. It is convenient to count a block of 20 small squares in each\r\ncorner of the large square. It distribution be even, the difference\r\nbetween the number of cells in any two such blocks should not exceed\r\ntwenty. Corpuscles which touch the upper and left sides should be\r\ncounted as if within the squares, those touching the lower and right\r\nsides, as outside, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n_Diluting Fluids_.--The most widely used are Hayem's and Toisson's.\r\nBoth of these have high specific gravities, so that, when well mixed,\r\nthe corpuscles do not separate quickly. Toisson's fluid is probably\r\nthe better for beginners, because it is colored and can be easily seen\r\nas it is drawn into the pipet. It stains the nuclei of leukocytes\r\nblue, but this is no real advantage. It must be filtered frequently.\r\n\r\n       HAYEM'S FLUID.                TOISSON'S FLUID.\r\n  Mercuric chlorid     0.5     Methyl-violet, 5 B     0.025\r\n  Sodium sulphate      5.0     Sodium chlorid         1.000\r\n  Sodium chlorid       1.0     Sodium sulphate        8.000\r\n  Distilled water    200.0     Glycerin              30.000\r\n                               Distilled water      160.000\r\n\r\n{155} _Sources of Error_.--The most common sources of error in making\r\na blood count are:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Inaccurate dilution, either from faulty technic or inaccurately\r\ngraduated pipets. The instruments made by Zeiss can be relied upon.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Too slow manipulation, allowing a little of the blood to\r\ncoagulate and remain in the capillary portion of the pipet.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Inaccuracy in depth of counting chamber, which sometimes results\r\nfrom softening of the cement by alcohol or heat. The slide should not\r\nbe cleaned with alcohol nor left to lie in the warm sunshine.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Uneven distribution of the corpuscles. This results when the\r\nblood is not thoroughly mixed with the diluting fluid, or when the\r\ncover-glass is not applied soon enough after the drop is placed upon\r\nthe disc.\r\n\r\n_Cleaning the Instrument_.--The instrument should be cleaned\r\nimmediately after using, and the counting chamber and cover must be\r\ncleaned again just before use.\r\n\r\nDraw through the pipet, successively, water, alcohol, ether, and air.\r\nThis can be done with the mouth, but it is much better to use a rubber\r\nbulb. When the mouth is used, the moisture of the breath will condense\r\nupon the interior of the pipet unless the fluids be shaken and not\r\nblown out. If blood has coagulated in the pipet--which happens when\r\nthe work is done too slowly--dislodge the clot with a horse-hair, and\r\nclean with strong sulphuric acid, or let the pipet stand over night in\r\na test-tube of the acid. Even if the pipet does not become clogged, it\r\nshould be occasionally cleaned in this way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. COLOR INDEX\r\n\r\nThis is an expression which indicates the amount of hemoglobin in each\r\nred corpuscle compared with the normal amount. For example, a color\r\nindex of 1.0 indicates that each corpuscle contains the normal amount\r\n{156} of hemoglobin; of 0.5, that each contains one-half the normal.\r\n\r\nThe color index is most significant in chlorosis and pernicious\r\nanemia. In the former it is usually much decreased; in the latter,\r\ngenerally much increased. In symptomatic anemia it is generally\r\nmoderately diminished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo obtain the color index, divide the percentage of hemoglobin by the\r\npercentage of corpuscles. The percentage of corpuscles is found by\r\nmultiplying the first two figures of the red corpuscle count by two.\r\nThis simple method holds good for all counts of 1,000,000 or more.\r\nThus, a count of 2,500,000 is 50 per cent. of the normal. If, then,\r\nthe hemoglobin has been estimated at 40 per cent., divide 40 (the\r\npercentage of hemoglobin) by 50 (the percentage of corpuscles). This\r\ngives 4/5, or 0.8, as the color index.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ENUMERATION OF LEUKOCYTES\r\n\r\nThe normal number of leukocytes varies from 5000 to 10,000 per cubic\r\nmillimeter of blood. The number is larger in robust individuals than\r\nin poorly nourished ones, and if disease be excluded, may be taken as\r\nan index of the individual's nutrition. Since it is well to have a\r\ndefinite standard, 7500 is generally adopted as the normal for the\r\nadult. With children the number is somewhat greater, counts of 12,000\r\nand 15,000 being common in healthy children under twelve years of age.\r\n\r\n_Decrease in number of leukocytes_, or _leukopenia_, is not important.\r\nIt is common in persons who are poorly nourished, although not\r\nactually sick. The infectious diseases in which leukocytosis is absent\r\n(p. 160) often cause a slight decrease of leukocytes. Chlorosis may\r\n{157} produce leukopenia, as also pernicious anemia, which usually\r\ngives it in contrast to the secondary anemias, which are frequently\r\naccompanied by leukocytosis.\r\n\r\n_Increase in number of leukocytes_ is common and of great importance.\r\nIt may be considered under two heads: A. Increase of leukocytes due to\r\nchemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-making organs, or\r\n_leukocytosis_. B. Increase of leukocytes due to _leukemia_. The\r\nformer may be classed as a _transient_, the latter, as a _permanent_,\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nA. LEUKOCYTOSIS\r\n\r\nThis term has not acquired a definite meaning. By some it is applied\r\nto any increase in number of leukocytes; by others, it is restricted\r\nto increase of the polymorphonuclear neutrophilic variety. As has been\r\nindicated, it is here taken to mean any increase in number of\r\nleukocytes caused by chemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-producing\r\nstructures; and includes every increase of leukocytes except that due\r\nto leukemia.\r\n\r\nBy chemotaxis is meant that property of certain agents by which they\r\nattract or repel leukocytes--positive chemotaxis and negative\r\nchemotaxis respectively. An excellent illustration is the accumulation\r\nof leukocytes at the site of inflammation, owing to the positively\r\nchemotactic influence of bacteria and their products. A great many\r\nagents possess the power of attracting leukocytes into the general\r\ncirculation. Among these are bacteria and many organic and inorganic\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\nChemotaxis alone will not explain the continuance of leukocytosis for\r\nmore than a short time. It is probable that substances which are\r\npositively chemotactic also stimulate the blood-producing organs to\r\nincreased {158} formation of leukocytes; and in at least one form of\r\nleukocytosis such stimulation probably plays the chief part.\r\n\r\nIn general, the response of the leukocytes to chemotaxis is a\r\nconservative process. It is the gathering of soldiers to destroy an\r\ninvader. This is accomplished partly by means of phagocytosis--actual\r\ningestion of the enemy--and partly by means of chemic substances which\r\nthe leukocytes produce.\r\n\r\nIn those diseases in which leukocytosis is the rule the degree of\r\nleukocytosis depends upon two factors: the severity of the infection\r\nand the resistance of the individual. A well-marked leukocytosis\r\nusually indicates good resistance. A mild degree means that the body\r\nis not reacting well, or else that the infection is too slight to call\r\nforth much resistance. Leukocytosis may be absent altogether when the\r\ninfection is extremely mild, or when it is so severe as to overwhelm\r\nthe organism before it can react. These facts are especially true of\r\npneumonia, diphtheria, and abdominal inflammations, in which\r\nconditions the degree of leukocytosis is of considerable prognostic\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen later, there are several varieties of leukocytes in\r\nnormal blood, and many chemotactic agents attract only one variety and\r\neither repel or do not influence the others. These varieties may be\r\ndivided into two general classes:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Those having active independent ameboid motion. They are able to\r\nmigrate readily from place to place and to ingest small bodies, as\r\nbacteria. From this latter property they derive their name of\r\n_phagocytes_. This group includes all varieties except the\r\nlymphocytes. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes are taken as the type of\r\nthe group, because they are by far the most numerous.\r\n\r\n{159} (_b_) Those having very little or no independent\r\nmotion--_non-phagocytic leukocytes_. Only the lymphocytes belong to\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nBy this classification we may distinguish two types of leukocytosis,\r\naccording to the type of cell chiefly affected: a phagocytic and a\r\nnon-phagocytic type.\r\n\r\n1. Phagocytic Leukocytosis.--Theoretically, there should be a\r\nsubdivision of phagocytic leukocytosis for each variety of phagocyte,\r\n_e.g._, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, eosinophilic leukocytosis,\r\nlarge mononuclear leukocytosis, etc. Practically, however, only one of\r\nthese, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, need be considered under the\r\nhead of leukocytosis. Increase in number of the other phagocytes will\r\nbe considered at another place. They are present in the blood in such\r\nsmall numbers normally that even a marked increase scarcely affects\r\nthe total leukocyte count; and, besides, substances which attract them\r\ninto the circulation frequently repel the polymorphonuclears, so that\r\nthe total number of leukocytes may actually be decreased.\r\n\r\nPolymorphonuclear leukocytosis may be either physiologic or\r\npathologic. A count of 20,000 would be considered a marked\r\nleukocytosis; of 30,000, high; above 50,000, extremely high.\r\n\r\n(1) Physiologic Polymorphonuclear Leukocytosis.--This is never very\r\nmarked, the count rarely exceeding 15,000 per cubic millimeter. It\r\noccurs in the new-born, in pregnancy, during digestion, and after cold\r\nbaths. There is moderate leukocytosis in the moribund state; this is\r\ncommonly classed as physiologic, but is probably due mainly to\r\nterminal infection.\r\n\r\n{160} (2) Pathologic Polymorphonuclear Leukocytosis.--The\r\nclassification here given follows Cabot:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Infectious and Inflammatory_.--The majority of infectious\r\ndiseases produce leukocytosis. The most notable exceptions are\r\ninfluenza, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, except when invading the\r\nserous cavities or when complicated by mixed infection, and typhoid\r\nfever, in which leukocytosis indicates an inflammatory complication.\r\n\r\nAll inflammatory and suppurative diseases cause leukocytosis, except\r\nwhen slight or well walled off. Appendicitis has been studied with\r\nespecial care in this connection, and the conclusions now generally\r\naccepted probably hold good for most acute intra-abdominal\r\ninflammations. A marked leukocytosis (20,000 or more) nearly always\r\nindicates abscess, peritonitis, or gangrene, even though the clinical\r\nsigns be slight. Absence of or mild leukocytosis indicates a mild\r\nprocess, or else an overwhelmingly severe one; and operation may\r\nsafely be postponed unless the abdominal signs are very marked. On the\r\nother hand, no matter how low the count, an increasing\r\nleukocytosis--counts being made hourly--indicates a spreading process\r\nand demands operation, regardless of other symptoms.\r\n\r\nLeukocyte counts alone are often disappointing, but are of much more\r\nvalue when considered in connection with a differential count of\r\npolymorphonuclears (see p. 181).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Malignant Disease_.--Leukocytosis occurs in about one-half of\r\nthe cases of malignant disease. In many instances it is probably\r\nindependent of any secondary infection, since it occurs in both\r\nulcerative and non-ulcerative cases. It seems to be more common in\r\nsarcoma than in carcinoma. Very large counts are rarely noted.\r\n\r\n{161} (_c_) _Post-hemorrhagic_.--Moderate leukocytosis follows\r\nhemorrhage and disappears in a few days.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Toxic_.--This is a rather obscure class, which includes gout,\r\nchronic nephritis, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, ptomain\r\npoisoning, prolonged chloroform narcosis, and quinin poisoning.\r\nLeukocytosis may or may not occur in these conditions, and is not\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Drugs_.--This also is an unimportant class. Most tonics and\r\nstomachics and many other drugs produce a slight leukocytosis.\r\n\r\n2. Non-phagocytic or Lymphocyte Leukocytosis.--This is characterized\r\nby an increase in the total leukocyte count, accompanied by an\r\nincrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The word \"lymphocytosis\" is\r\noften used in the same sense. It is better, however, to use the latter\r\nas referring to any increase in number of lymphocytes, without regard\r\nto the total count, since an actual increase in number of lymphocytes\r\nis frequently accompanied by a normal or subnormal leukocyte count,\r\nowing to loss of polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\nNon-phagocytic leukocytosis is probably due more to stimulation of\r\nblood-making organs than to chemotaxis. It is less common, and is\r\nrarely so marked as a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis. When marked, the\r\nblood cannot be distinguished from that of lymphatic leukemia.\r\n\r\nA marked lymphocyte leukocytosis occurs in pertussis, and is of value\r\nin diagnosis. It appears early in the catarrhal stage, and persists\r\nuntil after convalescence. The average leukocyte count is about\r\n17,000, lymphocytes predominating. There is moderate lymphocyte\r\nleukocytosis in other diseases of childhood, as rickets, scurvy, and\r\nespecially hereditary syphilis, where the blood-picture {162} may\r\napproach that of pertussis. It must be borne in mind in this\r\nconnection that lymphocytes are normally more abundant in the blood of\r\nchildren than in that of adults.\r\n\r\nSlight lymphocyte leukocytosis occurs in many other pathologic\r\nconditions, but is of little significance.\r\n\r\nB. LEUKEMIA\r\n\r\nThis is an idiopathic disease of the blood-making organs, which is\r\naccompanied by an enormous increase in number of leukocytes. The\r\nleukocyte count sometimes exceeds 1,000,000 per cubic millimeter, and\r\nleukemia is always to be suspected when it exceeds 50,000. Lower\r\ncounts do not, however, exclude it. The subject is more fully\r\ndiscussed later (p. 208).\r\n\r\nThe leukocytes are counted with the Thoma-Zeiss instrument, already\r\ndescribed. Recently, several new rulings of the disc have been\r\nintroduced, notably the Zappert and the Türk (Fig. 72), which give a\r\nruled area of nine square millimeters. They were devised for counting\r\nthe leukocytes in the same specimen with the red corpuscles. The red\r\ncells are counted in the usual manner, after which all the leukocytes\r\nin the whole area of nine square millimeters are counted; and the\r\nnumber in a cubic millimeter of undiluted blood is then easily\r\ncalculated. Leukocytes are easily distinguished from red cells,\r\nespecially when Toisson's diluting fluid is used. This method may be\r\nused with the ordinary ruling by adjusting the microscopic field to a\r\ndefinite size, and counting a sufficient number of fields, as\r\ndescribed later. Although less convenient, it is more accurate to\r\ncount the leukocytes separately, with less dilution of the blood, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{163} Technic.--A larger drop of blood is required than for counting\r\nthe erythrocytes, and more care in filling the pipet. Use the pipet\r\nwith 11 engraved above the bulb. Suck the blood to the mark 0.5 or\r\n1.0, and the diluting fluid to the mark 11. This gives a dilution of\r\n1:20 or 1:10, respectively. The dilution of 1:20 is easier to make.\r\nMix well by shaking in all directions except in the long axis of the\r\npipet; blow out two or three drops, place a drop in the counting\r\nchamber, and adjust the cover as already described (p. 153).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Türk ruling of counting chamber.]\r\n\r\nExamine with a low power to see that the cells are evenly distributed.\r\nCount with the two-thirds objective and a high eye-piece, or with the\r\nlong-focus one-sixth and a low eye-piece. {164} A one-fourth objective\r\nwill be found very satisfactory for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWith the ordinary ruling of the disc, count all the leukocytes in the\r\nlarge square, multiply by 10 to find the number in 1 c.mm. of diluted\r\nblood, and by the dilution to find the number per c.mm. of undiluted\r\nblood. In every case at least 100 leukocytes must be counted as a\r\nbasis for calculation, and it is much better to count 500. This will\r\nnecessitate examination of several drops from the pipet. With the\r\nZappert and Türk rulings a sufficient number can usually be counted in\r\none drop, but the opportunity for error is very much greater when only\r\none drop is examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Size of field required in counting leukocytes\r\nas described in the text.]\r\n\r\nIn routine work the author's modification of the \"circle\" method is\r\nvery satisfactory: Draw out the tube of the microscope until the field\r\nof vision has a diameter equal to eight {165} times the side of a\r\nsmall square (Fig. 73). The area of this field closely approximates\r\none-tenth of a square millimeter. With a dilution of 1:20, count the\r\nleukocytes in 20 such fields upon different parts of the disc without\r\nregard to the ruled lines, and to their sum add two ciphers. With\r\ndilution of 1:10, count 10 such fields, and add two ciphers. Thus,\r\nwith 1:10 dilution, if 150 leukocytes were counted in 10 fields, the\r\nleukocyte count would be 15,000 per c.mm. To compensate for possible\r\nunevenness of distribution, it is best to count a row of fields\r\nhorizontally and a row vertically across the disc. This method is\r\napplicable to any degree of dilution of the blood, and is simple to\r\nremember: _one always counts a number of fields equal to the number of\r\ntimes the blood has been diluted, and adds two ciphers_.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently impossible to obtain the proper size of field with\r\nthe objectives and eye-pieces at hand. In such case, place a cardboard\r\ndisc with a circular opening upon the diaphragm of the eye-piece, and\r\nadjust the size of the field by drawing out the tube. The circular\r\nopening can be cut with a cork-borer.\r\n\r\n_Diluting Fluids_.--The diluting fluid should dissolve the red\r\ncorpuscles so that they will not obscure the leukocytes. The simplest\r\nfluid is a 0.5 per cent. solution of acetic acid. More satisfactory is\r\nthe following: glacial acetic acid, 1 c.c.; 1 per cent. aqueous\r\nsolution of gentian-violet, 1 c.c.; distilled water, 100 c.c. These\r\nsolutions must be filtered frequently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ENUMERATION OF BLOOD-PLAQUES\r\n\r\nThe average normal number of plaques is variously given as 200,000 to\r\n700,000 per c.mm. of blood. The latter figure probably more nearly\r\nrepresents the true normal average, since the lower counts were\r\nobtained for the most part by workers who used unreliable methods.\r\nPhysiologic variations are marked; thus, the number {166} increases as\r\none ascends to a higher altitude, and is higher in winter than in\r\nsummer. There are unexplained variations from day to day; hence a\r\nsingle abnormal count should not be taken to indicate a pathologic\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nPathologic variations are often very great. Owing to lack of knowledge\r\nas to the origin of the platelets and to the earlier imperfect methods\r\nof counting, the clinical significance of these variations is\r\nuncertain. The following facts seem, however, to be established:\r\n\r\n(_a_) In acute infectious diseases the number is subnormal or normal.\r\nIf the fever ends by crisis, the crisis is accompanied by a rapid and\r\nstriking increase.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In secondary anemia plaques are generally increased, although\r\nsometimes decreased. In pernicious anemia they are always greatly\r\ndiminished, and an increase should exclude the diagnosis of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n(_c_) They are decreased in chronic lymphatic leukemia, and greatly\r\nincreased in the myelogenous form.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In purpura hæmorrhagica the number is enormously diminished.\r\n\r\nBlood-plaques are difficult to count owing to the rapidity with which\r\nthey disintegrate and to their great tendency to adhere to any foreign\r\nbody and to each other. The method of Kemp, Calhoun, and Harris is\r\npractical and is to be recommended:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWash the finger well and allow a few minutes to elapse for the\r\ncirculation to become normal. Prick the finger lightly with a\r\nblood-lancet, regulating the depth of the puncture so that the blood\r\nwill not flow without gentle pressure. Quickly dip a clean glass rod\r\ninto a vessel containing diluting and fixing fluid, and place two or\r\nthree good-sized drops upon the {167} finger over the puncture. Then\r\nexert gentle pressure above the puncture so that a small drop of blood\r\nwill exude into the fluid. Mix the two by passing the rod lightly\r\nseveral times over the surface of the blended drop. (Some workers\r\nfirst place a drop of the fluid upon the finger and then make the\r\npuncture through it, this necessitating less care as to depth of the\r\npuncture.) Now transfer a drop of the diluted blood from the finger to\r\na watch-glass which contains two or three drops of the fluid, and mix\r\nwell. From this, transfer a drop to the counting slide of the\r\nThoma-Zeiss hemocytometer, and cover. An ordinary thin cover will\r\nanswer for this purpose, and is preferable because it allows the use\r\nof a higher power objective. Allow the slide to stand for at least\r\nfive minutes, and then with a one-sixth or higher objective count the\r\nplaques and the red corpuscles in a definite number of squares. At\r\nleast 100 plaques must be counted. The number of red corpuscles per\r\ncubic millimeter of blood having been previously ascertained in the\r\nusual manner (p. 152), the number of plaques can easily be calculated\r\nby the following equation:\r\n\r\n  _r_:_p_ :: _R_:_P_; and _P_ = _p_ x _R_/_r_.\r\n\r\n_r_ represents the number of red corpuscles in any given number of\r\nsquares; _p_, the number of plaques in the same squares; _R_, the\r\ntotal number of red corpuscles per c.mm. of blood; and _P_, the number\r\nof plaques per c.mm.\r\n\r\nBeginners are apt to take too much blood and not to dilute it enough.\r\nBest results are attained when there are only one or two plaques in a\r\nsmall square. With insufficient dilution, the platelets are more or\r\nless obscured by the red cells.\r\n\r\nThe following diluting and fixing fluid is recommended:\r\n\r\n  Formalin                                        10 c.c.\r\n  1 per cent. aqueous solution sodium chlorid    150 c.c.\r\n  (Color with methyl-violet if desired.)\r\n\r\n{168} This fluid is cheap and easily prepared, and keeps indefinitely.\r\nIt fixes the plaques quickly without clumping, and does not clump nor\r\ndecolorize the reds. It has a low specific gravity, and hence allows\r\nthe plaques to settle upon the ruled area along with the reds. Fluids\r\nof high specific gravity cause the plaques to float so that they do\r\nnot appear in the same plane with the reds and the ruled lines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. STUDY OF STAINED BLOOD\r\n\r\nA. MAKING AND STAINING BLOOD-FILMS\r\n\r\n1. Spreading the Film.--Thin, even films are essential to accurate and\r\npleasant work. They more than compensate for the time spent in\r\nlearning to make them. There are certain requisites for success with\r\nany method: (_a_) The slides and covers must be perfectly clean;\r\nthorough washing with soap and water and rubbing with alcohol will\r\nusually suffice; (_b_) the drop of blood must not be too large; (_c_)\r\nthe work must be done quickly, before coagulation begins.\r\n\r\nThe blood is obtained from the finger-tip or the lobe of the ear, as\r\nfor a blood count; only a very small drop is required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEhrlich's Two-cover-glass Method.--This method is very widely used,\r\nbut considerable practice is required to get good results. Touch a\r\ncover-glass to the top of a small drop of blood, and place it, blood\r\nside down, upon another cover-glass. If the drop be not too large, and\r\nthe covers be perfectly clean, the blood will spread out in a very\r\nthin layer. Just as it stops spreading, before it begins to coagulate,\r\npull the covers quickly but firmly apart on a line parallel to their\r\nplane (Fig. 74). It is best to handle the covers with forceps, since\r\nthe moisture of the fingers may produce artifacts.\r\n\r\nTwo-slide Method.--Place a small drop of blood upon a {169} clean\r\nslide and push it along with the edge of a second slide held at an\r\nangle of 45 degrees to the surface of the first (Fig. 75).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Spreading the film: two-cover-glass method.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Spreading the film: two-slide method.]\r\n\r\nCigarette-paper Method.--This gives better results in the hands of the\r\ninexperienced than any of the methods in general use, and may be used\r\nwith either slides or covers. A very thin paper, such as the \"Zig-zag\"\r\nbrand, is best. Ordinary cigarette paper and thin tissue-paper will\r\nanswer, but do not give nearly so good results.\r\n\r\nCut the paper into strips about ¾ inch wide, _across the ribs_. Pick\r\nup one of the strips by the gummed edge, and touch its opposite end to\r\nthe drop of blood. Quickly place the end which has the blood against a\r\nslide or a large cover-glass held {170} in a forceps. The blood will\r\nspread along the edge of the paper. Now draw the paper evenly across\r\nthe slide or cover. A thin film of blood will be left behind (Fig.\r\n76).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Spreading the film. Cigarette-paper method\r\napplied to cover-glasses.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe films may be allowed to dry in the air, or may be dried by gently\r\nheating high above a flame (where one can comfortably hold the hand).\r\nSuch films will keep for years, but for some stains they must not be\r\nmore than a few weeks old. They must be kept away from flies--a fly\r\ncan work havoc with a film in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Fixing the Film.--In general, films must be \"fixed\" before they are\r\nstained. Fixation may be accomplished by chemicals or by heat. Those\r\nstains which are dissolved in methyl-alcohol combine fixation with the\r\nstaining process.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChemic Fixation.--Soak the film five to fifteen minutes in pure\r\nmethyl-alcohol, or one-half hour or longer in equal parts of absolute\r\nalcohol and ether. One minute in 1 per cent. formalin in alcohol is\r\npreferred by some. Chemic fixation may precede eosin-methylene-blue\r\nand other simple stains.\r\n\r\n{171} Heat Fixation.--This may precede any of the methods which do not\r\ncombine fixation with the staining process; it _must_ be used with\r\nEhrlich's triple stain. The best method is to place the film in an\r\noven, raise the temperature to 150° C., and allow to cool slowly.\r\nWithout an oven, the proper degree of fixation is difficult to attain.\r\nKowarsky has devised a small plate of two layers of copper (Fig. 77),\r\nupon which the films are placed together with a crystal of urea. The\r\nplate is heated over a flame until the urea melts, and is then set\r\naside to cool. This is said to give the proper degree of fixation, but\r\nin the writer's experience the films have always been underheated. He\r\nobtains better results by use of tartaric acid crystals\r\n(melting-point, 168°-170° C.). The plate, upon which have been placed\r\nthe cover-glasses, film side down, and a crystal of the acid, is\r\nheated over a low flame until the crystal has completely melted. It\r\nshould be held sufficiently high above the flame that the heating will\r\nrequire five to seven minutes. The covers are then removed. Freshly\r\nmade films of normal blood should be allowed to remain upon the plate\r\nfor a minute or two after heating has ceased. Fresh films require more\r\nheat than old ones, and normal blood more than the blood of pernicious\r\nanemia and leukemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Kowarsky's plate for fixing blood (Klopstock\r\nand Kowarsky).]\r\n\r\nFixation by passing the film quickly through a flame about twenty\r\ntimes, as is often done in routine work, is not recommended for\r\nbeginners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. Staining the Film.--The anilin dyes, which are extensively used in\r\nblood work, are of two general classes: {172} basic dyes, of which\r\nmethylene-blue is the type; and acid dyes, of which eosin is the type.\r\nNuclei and certain other structures in the blood are stained by the\r\nbasic dyes, and are hence called _basophilic_. Certain structures take\r\nup only acid dyes, and are called _acidophilic_, _oxyphilic_, or\r\n_eosinophilic_. Certain other structures are stained only by\r\ncombinations of the two, and are called _neutrophilic_. Recognition of\r\nthese staining properties marked the beginning of modern hematology.\r\n\r\n(1) Eosin and Methylene-blue.--In many instances this stain will give\r\nall the information desired. It is especially useful in studying the\r\nred corpuscles. Nuclei, basophilic granules, and all blood parasites\r\nare blue; erythrocytes are red or pink; eosinophilic granules, bright\r\nred. Neutrophilic granules and blood-plaques are not stained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Fix the film by heat or chemicals.\r\n\r\n(2) Stain about five minutes with 0.5 per cent. alcoholic solution of\r\neosin, diluted one-half with water.\r\n\r\n(3) Rinse in water, and dry between filter-papers.\r\n\r\n(4) Stain one-half to one minute with saturated aqueous solution of\r\nmethylene-blue.\r\n\r\n(5) Rinse well, dry, and mount. Films upon slides may be examined with\r\nan oil-immersion objective without a cover-glass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Ehrlich's Triple Stain.--This has been the standard blood-stain\r\nfor many years, and is still widely used. It is probably the best for\r\nneutrophilic granules. It is difficult to make, and should be\r\npurchased ready prepared from a reliable dealer. Nuclei are stained\r\nblue or greenish-blue; erythrocytes, orange; neutrophilic granules,\r\nviolet; and eosinophilic granules, copper red. {173} Basophilic\r\ngranules and blood-plaques are not stained (see Fig. 85).\r\n\r\nSuccess in staining depends largely upon proper fixation. The film\r\nmust be carefully fixed by heat: underheating causes the erythrocytes\r\nto stain red; overheating, pale yellow. The staining fluid is applied\r\nfor five to fifteen minutes, and the preparation is rinsed quickly in\r\nwater, dried, and mounted. Subsequent application of Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue for one-half to one second will bring out the\r\nbasophilic granules, and improve the nuclear staining, but there is\r\nconsiderable danger of overstaining.\r\n\r\n(3) Wright's Stain.--Recently the polychrome methylene-blue-eosin\r\nstains, dissolved in methyl-alcohol, have largely displaced other\r\nblood-stains for clinical purposes. They combine the fixing with the\r\nstaining process, and stain differentially every normal and abnormal\r\nstructure in the blood. Numerous methods of preparing and applying\r\nthese stains have been devised. Wright's stain is one of the best, and\r\nis the most widely used in this country. Directions for preparing it\r\nare given in most of the newer large text-books upon clinical\r\ndiagnosis. The practitioner will find it best to purchase the stain\r\nready prepared. Most microscopic supply houses keep it in stock. The\r\nmethod of application is as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(1) Without previous fixation, cover the blood film with the stain,\r\nand let stand one minute.\r\n\r\n(2) Add water, drop by drop, until a delicate metallic scum forms upon\r\nthe surface. Let this mixture remain on the preparation for two or\r\nthree minutes.\r\n\r\n(3) Wash in water until the better spread portions of the film have a\r\npinkish tint.\r\n\r\n(4) Dry between filter-papers and mount.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{174} The stain is more conveniently applied upon cover-glasses than\r\nupon slides. Films much more than a month old do not stain well. In\r\nsome localities ordinary tap-water will answer both for diluting the\r\nstain and for washing the film; in others, distilled water must be\r\nused. Different lots of Wright's fluid vary, and a few preliminary\r\nstains should be made with each lot to learn its peculiarities. The\r\nprincipal variation is in the amount of water which must be added to\r\nobtain the iridescent scum. Sometimes eight or more drops must be\r\nadded after the scum appears.\r\n\r\nWhen properly applied, Wright's stain gives the following picture\r\n(Plate VI): erythrocytes, yellow or pink; nuclei, various shades of\r\nbluish-purple; neutrophilic granules, reddish-lilac; eosinophilic\r\ngranules, bright red; basophilic granules of leukocytes and\r\ndegenerated red corpuscles, very dark bluish-purple; blood-plaques,\r\ndark lilac; bacteria, blue. The cytoplasm of lymphocytes is generally\r\nrobin's-egg blue; that of the large mononuclears may have a faint\r\nbluish tinge. Malarial parasites stain characteristically: the\r\ncytoplasm, sky-blue; the chromatin, reddish-purple.\r\n\r\n_Jenner's stain_, which gives a somewhat similar picture, is preferred\r\nby many for differential counting of leukocytes. It brings out\r\nneutrophilic granules rather more clearly, but does not compare with\r\nWright's fluid as a stain for the malarial parasite. Unfixed films are\r\nstained about three minutes, rinsed quickly, dried, and mounted.\r\n\r\nFor the physician who wishes to use only one blood-stain, Wright's\r\nfluid is undoubtedly the best of those mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.

STUDY OF STAINED FILMS\r\n\r\nMuch can be learned from stained blood-films. They furnish the best\r\nmeans of studying the morphology of the blood and blood parasites,\r\nand, to the experienced, they give a fair idea of the amount of\r\nhemoglobin and the number of red and white corpuscles. A\r\none-twelfth-inch objective is required.\r\n\r\n1. Erythrocytes.--Normally, the red corpuscles are acidophilic. The\r\ncolors which they take with different stains have been described. When\r\nnot crowded together, they appear as circular, homogeneous discs, of\r\nnearly uniform size, averaging 7.5 µ in diameter (Fig. 84). The center\r\nof each is somewhat paler than the periphery. The degree of pallor\r\nfurnishes a rough index to the amount of hemoglobin in the corpuscle.\r\nThey are apt to be crenated when the film has dried too slowly.\r\n\r\nPathologically, red corpuscles vary in size and shape, staining\r\nproperties, and structure.\r\n\r\n(1) Variations in Size and Shape (See Plate VIII and Fig. 84).--The\r\ncells may be abnormally small (called _microcytes_, 5 µ or less in\r\ndiameter); abnormally large (_macrocytes_, 10 to 12 µ); or extremely\r\nlarge (_megalocytes_, 12 to 20 µ).\r\n\r\nVariation in shape is often very marked. Oval, pyriform, caudate,\r\nsaddle-shaped, and club-shaped corpuscles are common. They are called\r\n_poikilocytes_, and their presence is spoken of as poikilocytosis.\r\n\r\nRed corpuscles which vary from the normal in size and shape are\r\npresent in most symptomatic anemias, and in the severer grades are\r\noften very numerous. Irregularities are particularly conspicuous in\r\nleukemia and pernicious anemia, where, in some instances, a normal\r\nerythrocyte {176} is the exception. In pernicious anemia there is a\r\ndecided tendency to large size and oval forms, and megalocytes are\r\nrarely found in any other condition.\r\n\r\n(2) Variations in Staining Properties (See Plate VIII).--These include\r\npolychromatophilia, basophilic degeneration, and basophilic stippling.\r\nThey are probably degenerative changes, although polychromatophilia is\r\nthought by many to be evidence of youth in a cell, and hence to\r\nindicate an attempt at blood regeneration.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Polychromatophilia_.--Some of the corpuscles partially lose\r\ntheir normal affinity for acid stains, and take the basic stain to\r\ngreater or less degree. Wright's stain gives such cells a faint bluish\r\ntinge when the condition is mild, and a rather deep blue when severe.\r\nSometimes only part of a cell is affected. A few polychromatophilic\r\ncorpuscles can be found in marked symptomatic anemias. They occur most\r\nabundantly in malaria, leukemia, and pernicious anemia.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Basophilic Granular Degeneration_ (_Degeneration of\r\nGrawitz_).--This is characterized by the presence, within the\r\ncorpuscle, of small basophilic granules. They stain deep blue with\r\nWright's stain; not at all, with Ehrlich's triple stain. The cell\r\ncontaining them may stain normally in other respects, or it may\r\nexhibit polychromatophilia.\r\n\r\nNumerous cells showing this degeneration are commonly found in chronic\r\nlead-poisoning, of which they were at one time thought to be\r\npathognomonic. Except in this disease, the degeneration indicates a\r\nserious blood condition. It occurs in well-marked cases of pernicious\r\nanemia and leukemia, and, much less commonly, in very severe\r\nsymptomatic anemias.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Basophilic Stippling_.--This term has been applied {177} to the\r\nfinely granular appearance often seen in red corpuscles, which harbor\r\nmalarial parasites (Plate VI). It is commonly classed with the\r\ndegeneration just described, but is probably distinct. Not all stains\r\nwill show it. With Wright's stain it can be brought out by staining\r\nlonger and washing less than for the ordinary blood-stain. The minute\r\ngranules stain reddish purple.\r\n\r\n(3) Variations in Structure.--The most important is the presence of a\r\nnucleus (Plates VI and VIII and Fig. 84). Nucleated red corpuscles, or\r\n_erythroblasts_, are classed according to their size: _microblasts_,\r\n5 µ or less in diameter; _normoblasts_, 5 to 10 µ; and _megaloblasts_,\r\nabove 10 µ. Microblasts and normoblasts contain one, rarely two,\r\nsmall, round, sharply defined, deeply staining nuclei, often located\r\neccentrically. Occasionally the nucleus is irregular in shape,\r\n\"clover-leaf\" forms being not infrequent. The megaloblast is probably\r\na distinct cell, not merely a larger size of the normoblast. Its\r\nnucleus is large, stains rather palely, has a delicate chromatin\r\nnetwork, and often shows evidences of degeneration (karyorrhexis,\r\netc.). In ordinary work, however, it is safer to base the distinction\r\nupon size than upon structure. Any nucleated red cell, but especially\r\nthe megaloblast, may exhibit polychromatophilia.\r\n\r\nNormally, erythroblasts are present only in the blood of the fetus and\r\nof very young infants. Pathologically, normoblasts occur in severe\r\nsymptomatic anemia, leukemia, and pernicious anemia. They are most\r\nabundant in myelogenous leukemia. While always present in pernicious\r\nanemia, they are often difficult to find. Megaloblasts are found in\r\npernicious anemia, and with extreme rarity in any other condition.\r\nThey almost invariably {178} exceed the normoblasts in number, which\r\nis one of the distinctive features of the disease. Microblasts have\r\nmuch the same significance as normoblasts, but are less common.\r\n\r\n2. The Leukocytes.--An estimation of the number or percentage of each\r\nvariety of leukocyte in the blood is called a _differential count_.\r\n\r\nThe differential count is best made upon a film stained with Wright's,\r\nJenner's, or Ehrlich's stain. Go carefully over the film with an\r\noil-immersion lens, using a mechanical stage if available. Classify\r\neach leukocyte seen, and calculate what percentage each variety is of\r\nthe whole number classified. For accuracy, 500 to 1000 leukocytes must\r\nbe classified; for approximate results, 200 are sufficient. Track of\r\nthe count may be kept by placing a mark for each leukocyte in its\r\nappropriate column, ruled upon paper. Some workers divide a slide-box\r\ninto compartments with slides, one for each variety of leukocyte, and\r\ndrop a coffee-bean into the appropriate compartment when a cell is\r\nclassified. When a convenient number of coffee-beans is used (any\r\nmultiple of 100), the percentage calculation is extremely easy.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of each variety in a cubic millimeter of blood is\r\neasily calculated from these percentages and the total leukocyte\r\ncount. An increase in actual number is an _absolute increase_; an\r\nincrease in percentage only, a _relative increase_. It is evident that\r\nan absolute increase of any variety may be accompanied by a relative\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nA record is generally kept of the number of nucleated red cells seen\r\nduring a differential count of leukocytes.\r\n\r\nThe usual classification of leukocytes is based upon their size, their\r\nnuclei, and the staining properties of the granules {179} which many\r\nof them contain. It is not altogether satisfactory, but is probably\r\nthe best which our present knowledge permits.\r\n\r\n(1) Normal Varieties.--(_a_) Lymphocytes.--These are small mononuclear\r\ncells without granules (Plate VI and Fig. 86). They are about the size\r\nof a red corpuscle or slightly larger, and consist of a single,\r\nsharply defined, deeply staining nucleus, surrounded by a narrow rim\r\nof protoplasm. The nucleus is generally round, but is sometimes\r\nindented at one side. Wright's stain gives the nucleus a deep purple\r\ncolor and the cytoplasm a pale robin's-egg blue in typical cells.\r\nLarger forms of lymphocytes are frequently found, especially in the\r\nblood of children, and are difficult to distinguish from the large\r\nmononuclear leukocytes.\r\n\r\nLymphocytes are formed in the lymphoid tissues, including that of the\r\nbone-marrow. They constitute, normally, 20 to 30 per cent. of all\r\nleukocytes, or about 1000 to 3000 per c.mm. of blood. They are more\r\nabundant in the blood of children.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of lymphocytes is usually moderately increased in those\r\nconditions which give leukopenia, especially typhoid fever, chlorosis,\r\npernicious anemia, and many debilitated conditions. A marked increase,\r\naccompanied by an increase in the total leukocyte count, is seen in\r\npertussis and lymphatic leukemia. In the latter, the lymphocytes\r\nsometimes exceed 98 per cent.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Large Mononuclear Leukocytes (Plate VI).--These cells are two or\r\nthree times the diameter of the normal red corpuscle. Each contains a\r\nsingle round or oval nucleus, often located eccentrically. The zone of\r\nprotoplasm surrounding the nucleus is relatively wide. With {180}\r\nWright's stain the nucleus is less deeply colored than that of the\r\nlymphocyte, while the cytoplasm is very pale blue or colorless, and\r\nsometimes contains a few reddish granules. The size of the cell, the\r\nwidth of the zone of cytoplasm, and the depth of color of the nucleus\r\nare the points to be considered in distinguishing between large\r\nmononuclears and lymphocytes. When large forms of the lymphocyte are\r\npresent, the distinction is often difficult or impossible. It is then\r\nadvisable to count the two cells together as lymphocytes. Indeed, they\r\nare regarded by some hematologists as identical.\r\n\r\nLarge mononuclear leukocytes probably originate in the bone-marrow or\r\nspleen. They constitute 2 to 4 per cent. of the total number of\r\nleukocytes: 100 to 400 per c.mm. of blood. An increase is unusual\r\nexcept in malaria, where it is quite constantly observed, and where\r\nmany of the cells contain ingulfed pigment.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Transitional Leukocytes (Plate VI).--These are essentially large\r\nmononuclears with deeply indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. A few\r\nfine neutrophilic granules are sometimes present in their cytoplasm.\r\n\r\nThey are probably formed from the large mononuclears, and occur in the\r\nblood in about the same numbers. The two cells are usually counted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Polymorphonuclear Neutrophilic Leukocytes (Plate VI).--There is\r\nusually no difficulty in recognizing these cells. Their average size\r\nis somewhat less than that of the large mononuclears. The nucleus\r\nstains rather deeply, and is extremely irregular, often assuming\r\nshapes comparable to letters of the alphabet, E, Z, S, etc. (Fig. 86).\r\nFrequently there appear to be several separate nuclei, hence the\r\nwidely used name, \"polynuclear {181} leukocyte.\" Upon careful\r\ninspection, however, delicate nuclear bands connecting the parts can\r\nusually be seen. The cytoplasm is relatively abundant, and contains\r\ngreat numbers of very fine neutrophilic granules. With Wright's stain\r\nthe nucleus is bluish-purple, and the granules, reddish-lilac.\r\n\r\nPolymorphonuclear leukocytes are formed in the bone-marrow from\r\nneutrophilic myelocytes. They constitute 60 to 75 per cent. of all the\r\nleukocytes: 3000 to 7500 per c.mm. of blood. Increase in their number\r\npractically always produces an increase in the total leukocyte count,\r\nand has already been discussed under \"phagocytic leukocytosis.\" The\r\nleukocytes of pus, _pus-corpuscles_, belong almost wholly to this\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells with the\r\ntotal leukocyte count yields more information than a consideration of\r\neither alone. With moderate infection and good resisting powers the\r\nleukocyte count and the percentage of polymorphonuclears are increased\r\nproportionately. When the polymorphonuclear percentage is increased to\r\na notably greater extent than is the total number of leukocytes, no\r\nmatter how low the count, either very poor resistance or a very severe\r\ninfection may be inferred. In the absence of acute infectious disease\r\na polymorphonuclear percentage of 85 or over points very strongly to\r\ngangrene or pus-formation. On the other hand, except in children,\r\nwhere the percentage is normally low, pus is uncommon with less than\r\n80 per cent. of polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\nNormally, the cytoplasm of leukocytes stains pale yellow with iodin.\r\nUnder certain pathologic conditions the cytoplasm of many of the\r\npolymorphonuclears stains {182} diffusely brown, or contains granules\r\nwhich stain reddish-brown with iodin. This is called _iodophilia_.\r\nExtracellular iodin-staining granules, which are present normally, are\r\nmore numerous in iodophilia.\r\n\r\nThis iodin reaction occurs in all purulent conditions except abscesses\r\nwhich are thoroughly walled off or purely tuberculous abscesses. It is\r\nof some value in diagnosis between serous effusions and purulent\r\nexudates, between catarrhal and suppurative processes in the appendix\r\nand Fallopian tube, etc. Its importance, however, as a diagnostic sign\r\nof suppuration has been much exaggerated, since it may occur in any\r\ngeneral toxemia, such as pneumonia, influenza, malignant disease, and\r\npuerperal sepsis.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate iodophilia, place the air-dried films in a stoppered\r\nbottle containing a few crystals of iodin until they become yellow.\r\nMount in syrup of levulose and examine with a one-twelfth objective.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Eosinophilic Leukocytes, or \"Eosinophiles\" (Plate VI).--The\r\nstructure of these cells is similar to that of the polymorphonuclear\r\nneutrophiles, with the striking difference that, instead of fine\r\nneutrophilic granules, their cytoplasm contains coarse granules having\r\na strong affinity for acid stains. They are easily recognized by the\r\nsize and color of the granules, which stain bright red with Wright's\r\nstain.\r\n\r\nEosinophiles are formed in the bone-marrow from eosinophilic\r\nmyelocytes. Their normal number varies from 50 to 400 per c.mm. of\r\nblood, or 1 to 4 per cent. of the leukocytes. An increase is called\r\n_eosinophilia_, and is better determined by the actual number than by\r\nthe percentage.\r\n\r\nSlight eosinophilia is physiologic during menstruation. {183} Marked\r\neosinophilia is always pathologic. It occurs in a variety of\r\nconditions, the most important of which are: infection by animal\r\nparasites; bronchial asthma; myelogenous leukemia; scarlet fever; and\r\nmany skin diseases.\r\n\r\nEosinophilia may be a symptom of _infection by any of the worms_. It\r\nis fairly constant in trichinosis, uncinariasis, filariasis, and\r\nechinococcus disease. In this country an unexplained marked\r\neosinophilia warrants examination of a portion of muscle for _Trichina\r\nspiralis_ (p. 255).\r\n\r\n_True bronchial asthma_ commonly gives a marked eosinophilia during\r\nand following the paroxysms. This is helpful in excluding asthma of\r\nother origin. Eosinophiles also appear in the sputum in large numbers.\r\n\r\nIn _myelogenous leukemia_ there is almost invariably an absolute\r\nincrease of eosinophiles, although, owing to the great increase of\r\nother leukocytes, the percentage is usually diminished. Dwarf and\r\ngiant forms are often numerous.\r\n\r\n_Scarlet fever_ is frequently accompanied by eosinophilia, which may\r\nhelp to distinguish it from measles.\r\n\r\nEosinophilia has been observed in a large number of _skin diseases_,\r\nnotably pemphigus, prurigo, psoriasis, and urticaria. It probably\r\ndepends less upon the variety of the disease than upon its extent.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Basophilic Leukocytes or \"Mast-cells\" (Plate VI).--In general,\r\nthese resemble polymorphonuclear neutrophiles except that the nucleus\r\nis less irregular and that the granules are larger and have a strong\r\naffinity for basic stains. They are easily recognized. With Wright's\r\nstain the granules are deep purple, while the nucleus is pale blue and\r\nis nearly or quite hidden by the granules, so that its form is\r\ndifficult to make out. These granules are not colored by Ehrlich's\r\nstain.\r\n\r\n{184} The nature of mast-cells is undetermined. They probably\r\noriginate in the bone-marrow. They are least numerous of the\r\nleukocytes in normal blood, rarely exceeding 0.5 per cent., or 25 to\r\n50 per c.mm. A notable increase is limited almost exclusively to\r\nmyelogenous leukemia, where they are sometimes very numerous.\r\n\r\n(2) Abnormal Varieties.--(_a_) Myelocytes (Plate VI).--These are large\r\nmononuclear cells whose cytoplasm is filled with granules. Typically,\r\nthe nucleus occupies about one-half of the cell, and is round or oval.\r\nIt is sometimes indented, with its convex side in contact with the\r\nperiphery of the cell. It stains rather feebly. The average diameter\r\nof this cell (about 15.75 µ) is greater than that of any other\r\nleukocyte, but there is much variation in size among individual cells.\r\nMyelocytes are named according to the character of their\r\ngranules--neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic myelocytes. These\r\ngranules are identical with the corresponding granules in the\r\nleukocytes just described. The occurrence of two kinds of granules in\r\nthe same cell is rare.\r\n\r\nMyelocytes are the bone-marrow cells from which the corresponding\r\ngranular leukocytes are developed. Their presence in the blood in\r\nconsiderable numbers is diagnostic of myelogenous leukemia. The\r\nneutrophilic form is the less significant. A few of these may be\r\npresent in very marked leukocytosis or any severe blood condition, as\r\npernicious anemia. Eosinophilic myelocytes are found only in\r\nmyelogenous leukemia, where they are often very numerous. The\r\nbasophilic variety is less common, and is confined to long-standing\r\nsevere myelogenous leukemia.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Atypical Forms.--Leukocytes which do not fit in {185} with the\r\nabove classification are not infrequently met, especially in\r\nhigh-grade leukocytosis, pernicious anemia, and leukemia. The nature\r\nof most of them is not clear, and their number is usually so small\r\nthat they may be disregarded in making a differential count. Among\r\nthem are: (_a_) Border-line forms between polymorphonuclear\r\nneutrophiles and neutrophilic myelocytes; (_b_) small neutrophilic\r\ncells with a single round, deeply staining nucleus: they probably\r\nresult from division of polymorphonuclear neutrophiles; (_c_)\r\n\"irritation forms\"--large non-granular mononuclear cells, whose\r\ncytoplasm stains fairly deep purple with Wright's stain, and intense\r\nbrown with Ehrlich's: they appear in the blood under the same\r\nconditions as myelocytes; (_d_) degenerated forms: vacuolated\r\nleukocytes, or merely palely or deeply staining homogeneous or\r\nreticulated masses of chromatin (Plate VI).\r\n\r\n3. Blood-plaques.--These are not colored by Ehrlich's stain, nor by\r\neosin and methylene-blue. With Wright's stain they appear as spheric\r\nor ovoid, reddish to violet, granular bodies, 2 to 4 µ in diameter.\r\nWhen well stained, a delicate hyaline peripheral zone can be\r\ndistinguished. In ordinary blood-smears they are usually clumped in\r\nmasses. A single platelet lying upon a red corpuscle may easily be\r\nmistaken for a malarial parasite (Plate VI).\r\n\r\nBlood-platelets are being much studied at present, but, aside from the\r\nfacts mentioned under their enumeration (p. 165), little of clinical\r\nvalue has been learned. They have been variously regarded as very\r\nyoung red corpuscles (the \"hematoblasts\" of Hayem), as disintegration\r\nproducts of leukocytes, as remnants of extruded nuclei of\r\nerythrocytes, and as independent nucleated bodies. The most probable\r\nexplanation of their origin seems to be that of {186} J. H. Wright,\r\nwho, from his recent studies, regards them as detached portions of the\r\ncytoplasm of certain giant-cells of the bone-marrow and spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. BLOOD PARASITES\r\n\r\nA study of blood bacteriology is useful, but is hardly practicable for\r\nthe practitioner. Most bacteria can be detected only by culture\r\nmethods. The _spirillum of relapsing fever_ can be identified by the\r\nmethod for the malarial parasite in fresh blood. The blood must be\r\ntaken during a paroxysm. The organism is an actively motile spiral\r\nthread, about four times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length.\r\nThe movements which its active motion causes among the corpuscles\r\nrender it conspicuous. It can also be seen in stained preparations\r\n(Fig. 78). The disease has rarely been seen in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Spirillum of relapsing fever (Karg and\r\nSchmorl).]\r\n\r\nOf the numerous animal parasites which have been {187} found in the\r\nblood, three are especially interesting clinically: _Plasmodium\r\nmalariæ_, _Filaria sanguinis hominis_, and _Trypanosoma hominis_.\r\n\r\n1. Plasmodium Malariæ.--This organism is one of a large group, the\r\n_hemosporidia_ (p. 247), many of which live within and destroy the red\r\ncorpuscles of various animals. Three varieties are associated with\r\nmalarial fever in man--the tertian, quartan, and estivo-autumnal\r\nmalarial parasites.\r\n\r\n(1) Life Histories.--There are two cycles of development: one, the\r\n_asexual_, in the blood of man; and the other, the _sexual_, in the\r\nintestinal tract of a particular variety of mosquito.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Asexual Cycle_.--The young organism enters the blood through\r\nthe bite of the mosquito. It makes its way into a red corpuscle, where\r\nit appears as a small, pale \"hyaline\" body. This body exhibits ameboid\r\nmovement and increases in size. Soon, dark-brown granules derived from\r\nthe hemoglobin of the corpuscle make their appearance within it. When\r\nit has reached its full size--filling and distending the corpuscle in\r\nthe case of the tertian parasite, smaller in the others--the\r\npigment-granules gather at the center or at one side; the organism\r\ndivides into a number of small hyaline bodies, the spores or\r\nmerozoites; and the red corpuscle bursts, setting spores and pigment\r\nfree in the blood-plasma. This is called segmentation. It coincides\r\nwith, and by liberation of toxins causes, the paroxysm of the disease.\r\nA considerable number of the spores are destroyed by leukocytes or\r\nother agencies; the remainder enter other corpuscles and repeat the\r\ncycle. Many of the pigment-granules are taken up by leukocytes. In\r\nestivo-autumnal fever segmentation occurs in the {188} internal organs\r\nand the segmenting and larger pigmented forms are not seen in the\r\nperipheral blood.\r\n\r\nThe asexual cycle of the tertian organism occupies forty-eight hours;\r\nof the quartan, seventy-two hours; of the estivo-autumnal, an\r\nindefinite time--usually twenty-four to forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nThe parasites are thus present in the blood in great groups, all the\r\nindividuals of which reach maturity and segment at approximately the\r\nsame time. This explains the regular recurrence of the paroxysms at\r\nintervals corresponding to the time occupied by the asexual cycle of\r\nthe parasite. Not infrequently there is multiple infection, one group\r\nreaching maturity while the others are still young; but the presence\r\nof two groups which segment upon the same day is extremely rare.\r\nFevers of longer intervals--six, eight, ten days--are probably due to\r\nthe ability of the body, sometimes of itself, sometimes by aid of\r\nquinin, to resist the parasites so that a number sufficient to cause a\r\nparoxysm do not accumulate in the blood until after several\r\nrepetitions of the asexual cycle. In estivo-autumnal fever the regular\r\ngrouping, while usually present at first, is soon lost, thus causing\r\n\"irregular malaria.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Sexual Cycle_.--Besides the ameboid individuals which pass\r\nthrough the asexual cycle, there are present with them in the blood\r\nmany individuals with sexual properties. These are called _gametes_.\r\nThey do not undergo segmentation. Many of them are apparently\r\nextracellular, but stained preparations usually show them to be\r\nsurrounded by the remains of a corpuscle. In tertian and quartan\r\nmalaria they cannot easily be distinguished from the asexual\r\nindividuals until a variable time after the blood leaves the body,\r\nwhen the male gamete sends out {189} one or more flagella. In\r\nestivo-autumnal malaria the gametes take distinctive ovoid and\r\ncrescentic forms, and are not difficult to recognize. They are very\r\nresistent to quinin and often persist in the blood long after the\r\nameboid forms have been destroyed, but are probably incapable of\r\ncontinuing the disease until they have passed through the cycle in the\r\nmosquito.\r\n\r\nWhen a malarious person is bitten by a mosquito, the gametes are taken\r\nwith the blood into its stomach. Here a flagellum from the male unites\r\nwith the female, which soon thereafter becomes encysted in the wall of\r\nthe intestine. After a time it ruptures, liberating many minute rods,\r\nor sporozoites, which have formed within it. These migrate to the\r\nsalivary glands, and are carried into the blood of the person whom the\r\nmosquito bites. Here they enter red corpuscles as young malarial\r\nparasites, and the majority pass through the asexual cycle just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Mosquitos--_Culex_ (1) and _anopheles_ (2)\r\n(Bergey).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Showing, on the left, _anopheles_ in resting\r\nposition, its dappled wing, and the position of its larvæ in water; on\r\nthe right, _culex_ in resting position, its plain wing, and the\r\nposition of its larvæ in water. The arrows indicate the directions\r\ntaken by the larvæ when the water is disturbed (Abbott).]\r\n\r\nThe sexual cycle can take place only within the body of one genus of\r\nmosquito, _anopheles_. Absence of this mosquito from certain districts\r\nexplains the absence of {190} malaria. It is distinguished from our\r\ncommon house-mosquito, _culex_, by the relative lengths of proboscis\r\nand palpi (Fig. 79), which can be seen with a hand-lens, by its\r\nattitude when resting, and by its dappled wing (Fig. 80). Anopheles is\r\nstrictly nocturnal in its habits; it usually flies low, and rarely\r\ntravels more than a few hundred yards from its breeding-place,\r\nalthough it may be carried by winds. These facts explain certain\r\npeculiarities in malarial infection; thus, infection occurs\r\npractically only at night; it is most common near stagnant water,\r\nespecially upon the side toward which the prevailing winds blow; and\r\nthe {191} danger is greater when persons sleep upon or near the ground\r\nthan in upper stories of buildings. The insects frequently hibernate\r\nin warmed houses, and may bite during the winter. A mosquito becomes\r\ndangerous in eight to fourteen days after it bites a malarious person,\r\nand remains so throughout its life.\r\n\r\n(2) Detection.--Search for the malarial parasite may be made in either\r\nfresh blood or stained films. If possible, the blood should be\r\nobtained a few hours before the chill--never during it nor within a\r\nfew hours afterward, since at that time (in single infections) only\r\nthe very young, unpigmented forms are present, and these are the most\r\ndifficult to find and recognize. Sometimes many parasites are found in\r\na microscopic field; sometimes, especially in estivo-autumnal\r\ninfection, owing to accumulation in internal organs, careful search is\r\nrequired to find any, despite very severe symptoms. Quinin causes them\r\nrapidly to disappear from the peripheral blood, and few or none may be\r\nfound after its administration. In the absence of organisms, the\r\npresence of pigment granules within leukocytes--polymorphonuclears and\r\nlarge mononuclears--may be taken as presumptive evidence of malaria.\r\nPigmented leukocytes (Plate VI) are most numerous after a paroxysm.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _In Fresh Unstained Blood_ (Plate VII).--Obtain a small drop of\r\nblood from the finger or lobe of the ear. Touch the center of a\r\ncover-glass to the top of the drop and quickly place it, blood side\r\ndown, upon a slide. If the slide and cover be perfectly clean and the\r\ndrop not too large, the blood will spread out so as to present only\r\none layer of corpuscles. Search with a one-twelfth-inch objective,\r\nusing very subdued light.\r\n\r\n{192} The young organisms appear as small, round, ring-like or\r\nirregular, colorless bodies within red corpuscles. The light spots\r\ncaused by crenation and other changes in the corpuscles are frequently\r\nmistaken for them, but are generally more refractive or have more\r\nsharply defined edges. The older forms are larger colorless bodies\r\ncontaining granules of brown pigment. In the case of the tertian\r\nparasite, these granules have active vibratory motion, which renders\r\nthem conspicuous; and as the parasite itself is very pale, one may see\r\nonly a large pale corpuscle in which fine pigment-granules are\r\ndancing. Segmenting organisms, when typical, appear as rosets, often\r\ncompared to daisies, the petals of which represent the segments, while\r\nthe central brown portion represents the pigment. Tertian segmenting\r\nforms are less frequently typical than quartan. Flagellated forms are\r\nnot seen until ten to twenty minutes after the blood has left the\r\nvessels. As Cabot suggests, one should, while searching, keep a sharp\r\nlookout for unusually large or pale corpuscles, and for anything which\r\nis brown or black, or in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII. EXPLANATION OF PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nVarious forms of malarial parasites (Thayer and Hewetson).\r\n\r\n1 to 10, inclusive, Tertian organisms; 11 to 17, inclusive, quartan\r\norganisms; 18 to 27, inclusive, estivo-autumnal organisms; 1, young\r\nhyaline form; 2, hyaline form with beginning pigmentation; 3,\r\npigmented form; 4, full-grown pigmented form; 5, 6, 7, 8, segmenting\r\nforms; 9, extracellular pigmented form; 10, flagellate form; 11, young\r\nhyaline form; 12, 13, pigmented forms; 14, fully developed pigmented\r\nform; 15, 16, segmenting forms; 17, flagellate form; 18, 19, 20,\r\nring-like and cross-like hyaline forms; 21, 22, pigmented forms; 23,\r\n24, segmenting forms; 25, 26, 27, crescents.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _In Stained Films_ (Plate VI).--Recognition of the parasite,\r\nespecially the young forms, is much easier in films stained by\r\nWright's or some similar stain than in fresh blood. When very scarce,\r\nthey may sometimes be found, although their structure is not well\r\nshown, by the method of Ruge. This consists in spreading a very thick\r\nlayer of blood, drying, placing for a few minutes in a fluid\r\ncontaining 5 per cent. formalin and 1 per cent. acetic acid, which\r\nremoves the hemoglobin and fixes the smear, rinsing, drying, and\r\nfinally staining. If Wright's stain be used in this method, it is\r\nrecommended that the {193} preparation be subsequently stained for a\r\nhalf-minute with borax-methylene-blue (borax, 5; methylene-blue, 2;\r\nwater, 100).\r\n\r\nIn films which are properly stained with Wright's fluid the young\r\norganisms are small, round, ring-like or irregular, sky-blue bodies,\r\neach with a very small, sharply defined, reddish-purple chromatin\r\nmass. Many structures--deposits of stain, dirt, blood-plaques lying\r\nupon red cells, etc.--may simulate them, but should not deceive one\r\nwho looks carefully for both the blue cytoplasm and the reddish-purple\r\nchromatin. A plaque upon a red corpuscle is surrounded by a colorless\r\nzone rather than by a distinct blue body. Young estivo-autumnal\r\nparasites commonly take a \"ring\" form (the chromatin mass representing\r\nthe jewel), which is infrequently assumed by the other varieties. The\r\nolder tertian and quartan organisms show larger sky-blue bodies with\r\nmore reticular chromatin, and contain brown granules of pigment,\r\nwhich, however, is less evident than in the living parasite. The\r\nchromatin is often scattered through the cytoplasm or apparently\r\noutside of it, and is sometimes difficult to see clearly. Typical\r\n\"segmenters\" present a ring of rounded segments or spores, each with a\r\nsmall, dot-like chromatin mass. With the tertian parasite, the\r\nsegments more frequently form an irregular cluster. The pigment is\r\ncollected near the center or scattered among the segments. In\r\nestivo-autumnal fever usually only the small \"ring bodies\" and the\r\ncrescentic and ovoid gametes are seen in the blood. The gametes are\r\neasily recognized. Their length is somewhat greater than the diameter\r\nof a red corpuscle. Their chromatin is usually centrally placed, and\r\nthey contain more or less coarse pigment. The remains of the {194} red\r\ncell often form a narrow rim around them or fill the concavity of the\r\ncrescent.\r\n\r\nWhile the parasites are more easily found in stained preparations, the\r\nvarieties are more easily differentiated in fresh blood. The chief\r\ndistinguishing points are included in the following table:\r\n\r\n                  VARIETIES OF THE MALARIAL ORGANISM\r\n\r\n         TERTIAN.       |       QUARTAN.       |   ESTIVO-AUTUMNAL.\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Asexual cycle,        | Seventy-two hours.   | Usually twenty-four\r\n  forty-eight hours.    |                      | to forty-eight hours.\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Substance pale,       | Highly refractive,   | Highly refractive.\r\n  transparent,          | comparable to waxy   |\r\n  comparable to hyaline | tube-cast.           |\r\n  tube-cast.            |                      |\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Outline indistinct.   | Distinct.            | Distinct.\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Ameboid motion        | Sluggish.            | Active.\r\n  active.               |                      |\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Mature asexual form   | Smaller.             | Young forms, only, in\r\n  large; fills and      |                      | peripheral blood.\r\n  often distends        |                      |\r\n  corpuscle.            |                      |\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+----------------------\r\n  Pigment-granules      | Much coarser, darker | Very few, minute,\r\n  fine, brown,          | in color,            | inactive.

Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.--Of the several varieties of this worm,\r\n_Filaria nocturna_ is most common and {195} most important clinically.\r\nThe adults are thread-like worms about 8 to 10 cm. long. They are\r\nrarely seen. They live in pairs in the lymphatic channels and glands,\r\nespecially those of the pelvis and groin, and often occur in such\r\nnumbers as to obstruct the flow of lymph. This is the most common\r\ncause of elephantiasis. Infection is very common in tropical\r\ncountries, especially in Samoa, the West Indies, Central America, and\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama. It is said that in Samoa 50 per cent. of the\r\nnatives are infected.\r\n\r\nThe female is viviparous, and produces vast numbers of embryos, which\r\nappear in the circulating blood. These embryos are very actively\r\nmotile, worm-like structures, about as wide as a red corpuscle and 0.2\r\nto 0.4 mm. long (Fig. 107). They are found in the peripheral blood\r\nonly at night, appearing about 8 P.M. and reaching their maximum\r\nnumber--which is sometimes enormous--about midnight. If the patient\r\nchange his time of sleeping, they will appear during the day.\r\nInfection is carried by a variety of mosquito, which acts as\r\nintermediate host.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis rests upon detection of embryos in the blood. They can be\r\nseen in stained preparations, but are best found in fresh unstained\r\nblood. A rather large drop is taken upon a slide, covered, and\r\nexamined with a low power. The embryo can be located by the commotion\r\nwhich its active motion produces among the corpuscles. This motion\r\nconsists almost wholly in apparently purposeless lashing and coiling\r\nmovements, and continues for many hours.\r\n\r\n3. Trypanosoma Hominis.--Various trypanosomes are common in the blood\r\nof fishes, amphibians, birds, and {196} mammals (Fig. 81). They live\r\nin the blood-plasma and do not attack the corpuscles. In some animals\r\nthey are apparently harmless; in others they are an important cause of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Trypanosomes from blood of gray rat\r\n(Boston).]\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma hominis_ is an actively motile, spindle-shaped organism,\r\ntwo or three times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length, with one\r\nend terminating in a long flagellum. It can be seen with medium power\r\nobjectives in either fresh or stained blood. Human trypanosomiasis is\r\ncommon in Africa. As a rule, it is a very chronic disease. \"Sleeping\r\nsickness\" is a late stage when the organisms have invaded the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid. Infection is carried by a biting fly, _Glossina\r\npalpalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. SERUM REACTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Agglutination.--In the blood-serum of persons suffering from\r\ncertain infectious diseases there exist soluble bodies, called\r\nagglutinins, which have the property of {197} rendering non-motile and\r\nclumping the specific micro-organism of the disease, and have little\r\nor no influence upon other bacteria. This \"agglutination\" takes place\r\neven when the blood is greatly diluted. Undiluted normal blood can\r\nagglutinate most bacteria, but loses this power when diluted to any\r\nconsiderable degree. These facts are taken advantage of in the\r\ndiagnosis of several diseases.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to the diagnosis of typhoid fever, the phenomenon is\r\nknown as the _Widal reaction_. As yet, it is the only agglutination\r\nreaction which has any practical value for the practitioner.\r\n\r\nEither blood-serum or the whole blood may be used. Serum is the\r\nbetter. To obtain it, it is convenient to use little vials, such as\r\ncan be made by breaking off the lower half-inch of the tubes which\r\nhave contained peptonizing powder. They must, of course, be well\r\ncleaned. One of these is filled to a depth of about one-fourth inch\r\nfrom a puncture in the finger, and is set aside for a few hours. When\r\nthe clot has separated, it is picked out with a needle, leaving the\r\nserum. One drop of the serum is then added to nine drops of normal\r\nsalt solution, making a dilution of 1:10. Distilled water may be used\r\nfor dilution, but is more liable to cause error. The dilution can be\r\nmore accurately made in the leukocyte pipet of the Thoma-Zeiss\r\ninstrument. When the whole blood is used, it can be secured in the\r\npipet and at once diluted with the salt solution. When it must be\r\ntransported a considerable distance, dried blood is most convenient. A\r\nlarge drop is allowed to dry upon a clean slide or unglazed paper. It\r\nwill keep for months without losing its agglutinating power. When\r\nready to make the test, the dried stain is dissolved in ten drops of\r\nnormal salt solution, care being {198} taken that the drops are about\r\nthe same size as the original drop of blood.\r\n\r\nThe reaction can be detected either microscopically or\r\nmacroscopically:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMicroscopic Method.--(1) The blood or serum having been obtained and\r\ndiluted 1:10 as just described, mix it with a bouillon culture of the\r\ntyphoid bacillus to any desired dilution. One drop of each makes a\r\nblood-dilution of 1:20, etc. The culture should be between eighteen\r\nand twenty-four hours old, and the bacilli must be actively motile. A\r\nstock agar culture should be kept at room temperature, and bouillon\r\ntubes inoculated the day before the examination is to be made. Agar\r\ncultures can be purchased from dealers in biologic products. They must\r\nbe renewed monthly.\r\n\r\nInstead of the bouillon culture, McFarland recommends the use of a\r\nsuspension made by removing some of the growth from the surface of a\r\nfresh agar culture and mixing it well with a little sterile water. It\r\nis then necessary to examine the suspension microscopically to make\r\nsure that there are no natural clumps.\r\n\r\n(2) Place a few drops of the mixture of blood and culture upon a\r\nperfectly clean slide and apply a cover-glass. The cover may be ringed\r\nwith vaselin to prevent evaporation, but this is not usually\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n(3) Examine at intervals with a high dry lens--a one-sixth will answer\r\nvery well. The light must be very subdued. At first the bacilli should\r\nbe actively moving about. If the blood be from a case of typhoid, they\r\nwill gradually lose their motion and gather together in clumps (Fig.\r\n82). The clumps should be large, and the few bacilli remaining\r\nisolated should be motionless. Pseudo-reactions, in which there are a\r\nfew small clumps of bacilli whose motion is not entirely lost,\r\ntogether with many freely moving bacilli scattered throughout the\r\nfield, should not mislead. As a control, a drop {199} of the culture\r\nshould always be examined before making the test.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Showing clumping of typhoid bacilli in the\r\nWidal reaction. At one point a crenated red blood-corpuscle is seen\r\n(Wright and Brown).]\r\n\r\nNormal blood may produce clumping if time enough be allowed. The\r\ndiagnostic value of a positive reaction is, therefore, impaired unless\r\nclumping takes place within a limited time. With dilution of 1:20 the\r\ntime limit should not exceed one-half hour; with 1:40, one hour. Tests\r\nbased upon lower dilution than 1:20 are probably not reliable.\r\n\r\nMacroscopic Method.--The principle is the same as that of the\r\nmicroscopic method. Clumping of the bacilli causes a flocculent\r\nprecipitate, which can be seen with the naked eye. A dead culture\r\ngives the same results as a living one. This method is as reliable as\r\nthe microscopic and is more convenient for the practitioner, although\r\nit requires more time.\r\n\r\nDead cultures, together with apparatus for diluting the blood, are put\r\nup at slight cost by various firms under the names of typhoid\r\ndiagnosticum, typhoid agglutometer, etc. Full directions accompany\r\nthese outfits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{200} The Widal reaction is positive in over 95 per cent. of all cases\r\nof typhoid fever. It may, rarely, be positive in other conditions,\r\nowing, sometimes at least, to faulty technic. It appears often as\r\nearly as the sixth or seventh day; usually during the second week. It\r\nremains during the whole course of the disease, and frequently\r\npersists for years.\r\n\r\n2. Opsonins.--That phagocytosis plays an important part in the body's\r\nresistance to bacterial invasion has long been recognized. According\r\nto Metchnikoff, this property of leukocytes resides entirely within\r\nthemselves, depending upon their own vital activity. The recent\r\nstudies of Wright and Douglas, upon the contrary, indicate that the\r\nleukocytes are impotent in themselves, and can ingest bacteria only in\r\nthe presence of certain substances which exist in the blood-plasma.\r\nThese substances have been named _opsonins_. Their nature is\r\nundetermined. They probably act by uniting with the bacteria, thus\r\npreparing them for ingestion by the leukocytes; but they do not cause\r\ndeath of the bacteria, nor produce any appreciable morphologic change.\r\nThey appear to be more or less specific, a separate opsonin being\r\nnecessary for phagocytosis of each species of bacteria. There are,\r\nmoreover, opsonins for other formed elements--red blood-corpuscles,\r\nfor example. It has been shown that the quantity of opsonins in the\r\nblood can be greatly increased by inoculation with dead bacteria.\r\n\r\nTo measure the amount of any particular opsonin in the blood Wright\r\nhas devised a method which involves many ingenious and delicate\r\ntechnical procedures. Much skill, such as is attained only after\r\nconsiderable training in laboratory technic, is requisite, and there\r\nare many sources {201} of error. It is, therefore, beyond the province\r\nof this work to recount the method in detail. In a general way it\r\nconsists in: (_a_) Preparing a mixture of equal parts of the patient's\r\nblood-serum, an emulsion of the specific micro-organism, and a\r\nsuspension of washed leukocytes; (_b_) preparing a similar mixture,\r\nusing serum of a normal person; (_c_) incubating both mixtures for a\r\ndefinite length of time; and (_d_) making smears from each, staining,\r\nand examining with a one-twelfth objective. The number of bacteria\r\nwhich have been taken up by a definite number of leukocytes is\r\ncounted, and the average number of bacteria per leukocyte is\r\ncalculated; this gives the \"phagocytic index.\" The phagocytic index of\r\nthe blood under investigation, divided by that of the normal blood,\r\ngives the _opsonic index_ of the former, the opsonic index of the\r\nnormal blood being taken as 1. Simon regards the percentage of\r\nleukocytes which have ingested bacteria as a more accurate measurement\r\nof the amount of opsonins than the number of bacteria ingested,\r\nbecause the bacteria are apt to adhere and be taken in in clumps.\r\n\r\nWright and his followers regard the opsonic index as an index of the\r\npower of the body to combat bacterial invasion. They claim very great\r\npractical importance for it as an aid to diagnosis and as a guide to\r\ntreatment by the vaccine method. This method of treatment consists in\r\nincreasing the amount of protective substances in the blood by\r\ninjections of normal-salt suspensions of dead bacteria of the same\r\nspecies as that which has caused and is maintaining the morbid\r\nprocess, these bacterial suspensions being called \"vaccines.\" The\r\nopinion of the majority of conservative men seems to be that while\r\nvaccine therapy is undoubtedly an important addition to our {202}\r\nmethods of treatment of bacterial infections, particularly of those\r\nwhich are strictly local, yet the value of the opsonic index in\r\nmeasuring resisting power or as an aid to diagnosis and guide to\r\ntreatment is still _sub judice_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. TESTS FOR RECOGNITION OF BLOOD\r\n\r\n1. Guaiac Test.--The technic of this test has been given (p. 89). It\r\nmay be applied directly to a suspected fluid, or, better, to the\r\nethereal extract. Add a few cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid\r\nto about 10 c.c. of the fluid; shake thoroughly with an equal volume\r\nof ether; decant, and apply the test to the ether. In case of dried\r\nstains upon cloth, wood, etc., dissolve the stain in distilled water\r\nand test the water, or press a piece of moist blotting-paper against\r\nthe stain, and touch the paper with drops of the guaiac and the\r\nturpentine successively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Teichmann's hemin crystals (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n2. Teichmann's Test.--This depends upon the production of\r\ncharacteristic crystals of _hemin_. It is a sensitive test, and, when\r\npositive, is absolute proof of the presence of blood. A number of\r\nsubstances--lime, fine {203} sand, iron rust--interfere with\r\nproduction of the crystals; hence negative results are not always\r\nconclusive. Dissolve the suspected stain in a few drops of normal salt\r\nsolution upon a slide. If a liquid is to be tested, evaporate some of\r\nit upon a slide and dissolve the residue in a few drops of the salt\r\nsolution. Let dry, apply a cover-glass, and run glacial acetic acid\r\nunderneath it. Heat _very gently_ until bubbles begin to form,\r\nreplacing the acid as it evaporates. Allow to cool slowly. When cool,\r\nreplace the acid with water, and examine for hemin crystals with\r\ntwo-thirds and one-sixth objectives. The crystals are dark-brown\r\nrhombic plates lying singly or in crosses, and are easily recognized\r\n(Fig. 83). Failure to obtain them may be due to too great heat or too\r\nrapid cooling. If not obtained at first, let the slide stand in a warm\r\nplace, as upon a hot-water radiator, for an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. SPECIAL BLOOD PATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe more conspicuous characteristics of the blood in various diseases\r\nhave been mentioned in previous sections. Although the great majority\r\nof blood changes are secondary, there are a few blood conditions in\r\nwhich the changes are so prominent, or the etiology so obscure, that\r\nthey are commonly regarded as blood diseases. These will receive brief\r\nconsideration here.\r\n\r\nA. ANEMIA\r\n\r\nThis is a deficiency of hemoglobin, or red corpuscles, or both. It is\r\neither primary or secondary. The distinction is based chiefly upon\r\netiology, although each type presents a more or less distinctive\r\nblood-picture. Secondary anemia is that which is symptomatic of some\r\nother {204} pathologic condition. Primary anemia is that which\r\nprogresses without apparent cause.\r\n\r\n1. Secondary Anemia.--The more important conditions which produce\r\nsecondary or symptomatic anemia are:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Poor nutrition_, which usually accompanies unsanitary\r\nconditions, poor and insufficient food, etc.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Acute infectious diseases_, especially rheumatism and typhoid\r\nfever. The anemia is more conspicuous during convalescence.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Chronic infectious diseases_: tuberculosis, malaria, syphilis,\r\nleprosy.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Chronic exhausting diseases_, as heart disease, chronic\r\nnephritis, cirrhosis of the liver, and gastro-intestinal diseases,\r\nespecially when associated with atrophy of gastric and duodenal\r\nglands. The last may give an extreme anemia, indistinguishable from\r\npernicious anemia.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Chronic poisoning_, as from lead, arsenic, and phosphorus.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Hemorrhage_--either repeated small hemorrhages, as from gastric\r\ncancer and ulcer, uterine fibroids, etc., or a single large one.\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Malignant tumors_: these affect the blood partly through\r\nrepeated small hemorrhages, partly through toxic products, and partly\r\nthrough interference with nutrition.\r\n\r\n(_h_) _Animal Parasites_.--Some cause no appreciable change in the\r\nblood; others, like the _Uncinaria_ and _Bothriocephalus latus_, may\r\nproduce a very severe anemia, almost identical with pernicious anemia.\r\nAnemia in these cases is probably due both to toxins and to\r\nabstraction of blood.\r\n\r\nThe blood-picture varies with the grade of anemia. {205} Diminution of\r\nhemoglobin is the most characteristic feature. In mild cases it is\r\nslight, and is the only blood change to be noted. In very severe cases\r\nhemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Red corpuscles are diminished in\r\nall but very mild cases, while in the severest cases the red corpuscle\r\ncount is sometimes below 2,000,000. The color index is usually\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of leukocytes bears no relation to the anemia,\r\nleukocytosis is common, being due to the same cause.\r\n\r\nStained films show no changes in very mild cases. In moderate cases\r\nvariations in size and shape of the red cells and polychromatophilia\r\noccur. Very severe cases show the same changes to greater degree, with\r\naddition of basophilic degeneration and the presence of normoblasts in\r\nsmall or moderate numbers. Megaloblasts in very small numbers have\r\nbeen encountered in extremely severe cases. Blood-plaques are usually\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n2. Primary Anemia.--The commonly described varieties of primary anemia\r\nare pernicious anemia and chlorosis, but splenic anemia may also be\r\nmentioned under this head.\r\n\r\n(1) Progressive Pernicious Anemia.--It is frequently impossible to\r\ndiagnose this disease from the blood examination alone. Severe\r\nsecondary anemia sometimes gives an identical picture. Remissions, in\r\nwhich the blood approaches the normal, are common. All the clinical\r\ndata must, therefore, be considered.\r\n\r\nHemoglobin and red corpuscles are always greatly diminished. In none\r\nof Cabot's 139 cases did the count exceed 2,500,000, the average being\r\nabout 1,200,000. In more than two-thirds of the cases hemoglobin was\r\n{206} reduced to less extent than the red corpuscles: the color-index\r\nwas, therefore, high. A low color-index probably indicates a mild type\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nThe leukocyte count may be normal, but is commonly diminished to about\r\n3000. The decrease affects chiefly the polymorphonuclear cells, so\r\nthat the lymphocytes are relatively increased. In some cases a decided\r\nabsolute increase of lymphocytes occurs. Polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytosis, when present, is due to some complication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--_A_, Normal blood; _B_, chlorosis; _C_,\r\npernicious anemia. The plate shows the sharp contrast between cells\r\nrich in hemoglobin and the pale cell of chlorosis, and also the\r\npoikilocytosis and marked variations in size noted in pernicious\r\nanemia.

There is a decided {207} tendency to large oval forms,\r\nand despite the abundance of microcytes, the average size of the\r\ncorpuscles is generally strikingly increased. Polychromatophilia and\r\nbasophilic degeneration are common. Nucleated red cells are always\r\npresent, although in many instances careful search is required to find\r\nthem. In the great majority of cases megaloblasts exceed normoblasts\r\nin number. This ratio constitutes one of the most important points in\r\ndiagnosis, since it is practically unknown in other diseases.\r\nBlood-plaques are diminished.\r\n\r\nThe rare and rapidly fatal anemia which has been described under the\r\nname of _aplastic anemia_ is probably a variety of pernicious anemia.\r\nAbsence of any attempt at blood regeneration explains the marked\r\ndifference in the blood picture. Red corpuscles and hemoglobin are\r\nrapidly diminished to an extreme degree. The color index is normal or\r\nlow. The leukocyte count is normal or low, with relative increase of\r\nlymphocytes. Stained smears show only slight variations in size,\r\nshape, and staining properties of the red cells. There are no\r\nmegaloblasts, and few or no normoblasts.\r\n\r\n(2) Chlorosis.--The clinical symptoms furnish the most important data\r\nfor diagnosis. The blood resembles that of secondary anemia in many\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous feature is a decided decrease of hemoglobin (down\r\nto 30 or 40 per cent. in marked cases), accompanied by a slight\r\ndecrease in number of red corpuscles. The color-index is thus almost\r\ninvariably low, the average being about 0.5.\r\n\r\nAs in pernicious anemia, the leukocytes are normal or decreased in\r\nnumber, with a relative increase of lymphocytes.\r\n\r\n{208} In contrast to pernicious anemia (and in some degree also to\r\nsecondary anemia) the red cells are of nearly uniform size, are\r\nuniformly pale (Fig. 84), and their average diameter is somewhat less\r\nthan normal. Changes in size, shape, and staining reactions occur only\r\nin severe cases. Erythroblasts are rarely present. The number of\r\nplaques is generally decreased.\r\n\r\n(3) Splenic Anemia.--This is an obscure form of anemia associated with\r\ngreat enlargement of the spleen. It is probably a distinct entity.\r\nThere is decided decrease of hemoglobin and red corpuscles, with\r\nmoderate leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. Osler's fifteen cases\r\naveraged 47 per cent. hemoglobin and 3,336,357 red cells. Stained\r\nfilms show notable irregularities in size, shape, and staining\r\nproperties only in advanced cases. Erythroblasts are uncommon.\r\n\r\nB. LEUKEMIA\r\n\r\nExcept in rare instances, diagnosis is easily made from the blood\r\nalone. Two types of the disease are commonly distinguished: the\r\n_myelogenous_ and the _lymphatic_. Atypical and intermediate forms are\r\nnot uncommon. Pseudoleukemia, because of its clinical similarity to\r\nlymphatic leukemia, is generally described along with leukemia.\r\n\r\n1. Myelogenous Leukemia.--This is usually a chronic disease, although\r\nacute cases have been described.\r\n\r\nHemoglobin and red corpuscles show decided decrease. The color-index\r\nis moderately low.\r\n\r\nMost striking is the immense increase in number of leukocytes. The\r\ncount in ordinary cases varies between 100,000 and 300,000. Counts\r\nover 1,000,000 have been {209} met. During remissions, the leukocyte\r\ncount may fall to normal.\r\n\r\nWhile these enormous leukocyte counts are equaled in no other disease,\r\nand approached only in lymphatic leukemia and extremely high-grade\r\nleukocytosis, the diagnosis, particularly during remissions, depends\r\nmore upon qualitative than quantitative changes. Although all\r\nvarieties are increased, the characteristic and conspicuous cell is\r\nthe myelocyte. This cell never appears in normal blood; extremely\r\nrarely in leukocytosis; and never abundantly in lymphatic leukemia. In\r\nmyelogenous leukemia myelocytes usually constitute more than 20 per\r\ncent. of all leukocytes. Da Costa's lowest case gave 7 per cent. The\r\nneutrophilic form is generally much more abundant than the\r\neosinophilic. Both show considerable variations in size. Very constant\r\nalso is a marked absolute, and often a relative, increase of\r\neosinophiles and basophiles. Polymorphonuclear neutrophiles and\r\nlymphocytes are relatively decreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Blood from a case of splenomedullary\r\nleukemia, stained with Ehrlich's triple stain (Jakob).]\r\n\r\n{210} The red cells show the changes characteristic of a severe\r\nsecondary anemia, except that nucleated reds are commonly abundant; in\r\nfact, no other disease gives so many. They are chiefly of the\r\nnormoblastic type. Megaloblasts are uncommon. Blood-plaques are\r\ngenerally increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Blood: Lymphatic leukemia (lower section);\r\nmarked leukocytosis (upper section). Stained smears. Compare types of\r\nleukocytes with Fig. 85 (from Greene's \"Medical Diagnosis\").]\r\n\r\n2. Lymphatic Leukemia.--This form may be either acute or chronic.\r\nThere is marked loss of hemoglobin and red corpuscles. The color-index\r\nis usually moderately low.\r\n\r\nThe leukocyte count is high, but lower than in the myelogenous type.\r\nCounts of 100,000 are about the average, but in many cases are much\r\nlower. This high {211} count is referable almost wholly to increase of\r\nlymphocytes. They generally exceed 90 per cent. of the total number.\r\nIn chronic cases they are chiefly of the small variety; in acute\r\ncases, of the large form. Myelocytes are rare.\r\n\r\nThe red corpuscles show the changes usual in severe secondary anemia.\r\nErythroblasts are seldom abundant. Blood-plaques are decreased.\r\n\r\n3. Pseudoleukemia (Hodgkin's disease) resembles lymphatic leukemia in\r\nthat there is marked and progressive enlargement of the lymph-nodes.\r\nThere is, however, no distinctive blood-picture. The changes in\r\nhemoglobin and red cells resemble those of a moderate symptomatic\r\nanemia, with rather low color-index. The leukocytes are commonly\r\nnormal in number and relative proportions.\r\n\r\n4. Anæmia Infantum Pseudoleukæmica.--Under this name von Jaksch\r\ndescribed a rare disease of infancy, the proper classification of\r\nwhich is uncertain. There is enlargement of liver and spleen, and\r\nsometimes of lymph-nodes, together with the following blood-changes:\r\ngrave anemia with deformed and degenerated red cells and many\r\nerythroblasts of both normoblastic and megaloblastic types; great\r\nincrease in number of leukocytes (20,000 to 100,000), and great\r\nvariations in size, shape, and staining of leukocytes, with many\r\natypical forms and a few myelocytes.\r\n\r\nThe table on the following page contrasts the distinctive\r\nblood-changes in the more common conditions.\r\n\r\n{212}           DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF BLOOD DISEASES\r\n\r\n    SECONDARY  | PERNICIOUS  |             | MYELOGENOUS | LYMPHATIC\r\n     ANEMIA.   |   ANEMIA.   |  CHLOROSIS. |  LEUKEMIA.  |  LEUKEMIA.\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Hemoglobin.\r\n  Diminished   | Diminished. | Greatly     | Decidedly   | Markedly\r\n  according to |             | diminished. | diminished. | diminished.\r\n  degree of    |             |             |             |\r\n  anemia.      |             |             |             |\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Red Corpuscle Count.\r\n  Normal in    | Greatly     | Slightly    | Decidedly   | Markedly\r\n  mild cases;  | diminished. | diminished. | diminished. | diminished.\r\n  diminished   |             |             |             |\r\n  in all       |             |             |             |\r\n  others.      |             |             |             |\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Color-index.\r\n  Normal or    | High.       | Low.        | Usually     | Usually\r\n  slightly     |             |             | slightly    | slightly\r\n  diminished.  |             |             | diminished. | diminished.\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Leukocyte Count.\r\n  Not          | Normal or   | Normal or   | Extremely   | Very high.\r\n  necessarily  | diminished. | diminished. | high.       |\r\n  affected;    |             |             |             |\r\n  leukocytosis |             |             |             |\r\n  common.      |             |             |             |\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Red Corpuscles on Stained Films.\r\n  Variations   | Marked      | Nearly      | Similar to  | Similar to\r\n  in size and  | variations  | uniform size| secondary   | secondary\r\n  shape in     | in size,    | and shape;  | anemia,     | anemia.\r\n  moderate     | shape, and  | average size| except      | Erythro-\r\n  cases;       | staining    | decreased;  | normoblasts | blasts not\r\n  variations   | reactions.  | pale        | generally   | numerous.\r\n  in staining  | Average size| centers.    | very        |\r\n  reactions    | increased.  | Erythro-    | numerous.   |\r\n  and          | Tendency to | blasts very |             |\r\n  normoblasts  | large oval  | rare.       |             |\r\n  in severe    | forms.      |             |             |\r\n  cases.       | Erythro-    |             |             |\r\n               | blasts      |             |             |\r\n               | always      |             |             |\r\n               | present;    |             |             |\r\n               | megaloblasts|             |             |\r\n               | exceed      |             |             |\r\n               | normoblasts.|             |             |\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Leukocytes on Stained Films.\r\n  Normal       | Lymphocytes | Lymphocytes | Large       | Lymphocytes\r\n  proportions  | relatively, | apt to be   | numbers of  | exceed 90\r\n  or increase  | sometimes   | relatively  | myelocytes  | per cent.\r\n  of           | absolutely, | increased.  | (average, 20| Other\r\n  polynuclears.| increased.  |             | per cent.). | varieties\r\n               |             |             | Absolute    | relatively\r\n               |             |             | increase of | decreased.\r\n               |             |             | eosinophiles|\r\n               |             |             | and         |\r\n               |             |             | basophiles. |\r\n               |             |             | Relative    |\r\n               |             |             | decrease of |\r\n               |             |             | polynuclears|\r\n               |             |             | and         |\r\n               |             |             | lymphocytes.|\r\n  -------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STOMACH\r\n\r\n\r\nLaboratory methods may be applied to the diagnosis of stomach\r\ndisorders in: I. Examination of the gastric contents removed with the\r\nstomach-tube. II. Certain other examinations which give information as\r\nto the condition of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. EXAMINATION OF THE GASTRIC CONTENTS\r\n\r\nStomach digestion consists mainly in the action of pepsin upon\r\nproteids in the presence of hydrochloric acid and in the curdling of\r\nmilk by rennin.\r\n\r\nPepsin and rennin are secreted by the gastric glands as\r\nzymogens--pepsinogen and renninogen, respectively--which are converted\r\ninto pepsin and rennin by hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is\r\nsecreted by certain cells of the fundus glands. It at once combines\r\nloosely with the proteids of the food, forming acid-albumin, the first\r\nstep in proteid digestion. Hydrochloric acid, which is thus loosely\r\ncombined with proteids, is called \"combined\" hydrochloric acid. The\r\nacid which is secreted after the proteids present have all been\r\nconverted into acid-albumin remains as \"free\" hydrochloric acid, and,\r\ntogether with pepsin, continues the process of digestion.\r\n\r\nAt the height of digestion the stomach-contents consist essentially\r\nof: (1) Water; (2) free hydrochloric acid; (3) combined hydrochloric\r\nacid; (4) pepsin; (5) rennin; {214} (6) mineral salts, chiefly acid\r\nphosphates, of no clinical importance; (7) particles of undigested and\r\npartly digested food; (8) various products of digestion in solution.\r\nIn pathologic conditions there may be present, in addition, various\r\nmicroscopic structures and certain organic acids, of which lactic acid\r\nis most important.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA routine examination is conveniently carried out in the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n(1) Give the patient a test-meal upon an empty stomach, washing the\r\nstomach previously if necessary.\r\n\r\n(2) At the height of digestion, usually in one hour, remove the\r\ncontents of the stomach with a stomach-tube.\r\n\r\n(3) Measure and examine macroscopically.\r\n\r\n(4) Filter. A suction filter is desirable, and may be necessary when\r\nmuch mucus is present.\r\n\r\n(5) During filtration, examine microscopically and make qualitative\r\ntests for--(_a_) free acids; (_b_) free hydrochloric acid; (_c_)\r\nlactic acid.\r\n\r\n(6) When sufficient filtrate is obtained, make quantitative\r\nestimations of--(_a_) total acidity; (_b_) free hydrochloric acid;\r\n(_c_) combined hydrochloric acid (if necessary).\r\n\r\n(7) Make whatever additional tests seem desirable, as for blood,\r\npepsin, or rennin.\r\n\r\nA. OBTAINING THE CONTENTS\r\n\r\nGastric juice is secreted continuously, but quantities sufficiently\r\nlarge for examination are not usually obtainable from the fasting\r\nstomach. In clinical work, therefore, it is desirable to stimulate\r\nsecretion with food--which is the natural and most efficient\r\nstimulus--before attempting to collect the gastric fluid. Different\r\nfoods stimulate secretion to different degrees; hence for the sake of\r\nuniform results certain standard \"test-meals\" have been {215} adopted.\r\nThose mentioned here give practically the same results.\r\n\r\n1. Test-meals.--It is customary to give the test-meal in the morning,\r\nsince the stomach is most apt to be empty at that time. If it be\r\nsuspected that the stomach will not be empty, it should be washed out\r\nwith water the evening before.\r\n\r\n(1) Ewald's test-breakfast consists of a roll (or two slices of bread)\r\nwithout butter and two small cups (300 to 400 c.c.) of water or weak\r\ntea without cream or sugar. It should be well masticated. The contents\r\nof the stomach are to be removed one hour afterward. This test-meal is\r\nused for most routine examinations. Its disadvantage is that it\r\nintroduces, with the bread, a variable amount of lactic acid and\r\nnumerous yeast-cells. This source of error may be eliminated by\r\nsubstituting a shredded whole-wheat biscuit for the roll.\r\n\r\n(2) Boas' test-breakfast consists of a tablespoonful of rolled oats in\r\na quart of water, boiled to one pint, with a pinch of salt added. It\r\nshould be withdrawn in forty-five minutes to one hour. This meal does\r\nnot contain lactic acid, and is usually given when detection of lactic\r\nacid is important, as in suspected gastric cancer. The stomach should\r\nalways be washed with water the evening previous.\r\n\r\n2. Withdrawal of the Contents.--The Boas stomach-tube, with bulb, is\r\nprobably the most satisfactory form. It should be of rather large\r\ncaliber, and have an opening in the tip and one or two in the side\r\nnear the tip. When not in use, it should be kept in a vessel of borax\r\nsolution, and should be well washed in hot water both before and after\r\nusing.\r\n\r\nIt is important confidently to assure the patient that introduction of\r\nthe tube cannot possibly harm him; and {216} that, if he can control\r\nthe spasm of his throat, he will experience very little choking\r\nsensation. When patients are very nervous, it is well to spray the\r\nthroat with cocain solution.\r\n\r\nThe tube should be dipped in warm water just before using: the use of\r\nglycerin or other lubricant is undesirable. With the patient seated\r\nupon a chair, his clothing protected by towels or a large apron, and\r\nhis head tilted forward, the tip of the tube, held as one would a pen,\r\nis introduced far back into the pharynx. He is then urged to swallow,\r\nand the tube is pushed boldly into the esophagus until the ring upon\r\nit reaches the incisor teeth, thus indicating that the tip is in the\r\nstomach. If, now, the patient cough or strain as if at stool, the\r\ncontents of the stomach will usually be forced out through the tube.\r\nShould it fail, the fluid can generally be pumped out by alternate\r\ncompression of the tube and the bulb. If unsuccessful at first, the\r\nattempts should be repeated with the tube pushed a little further in,\r\nor withdrawn a few inches, since the distance to the stomach is not\r\nthe same in all cases. The tube may become clogged with pieces of\r\nfood, in which case it must be withdrawn, cleaned, and reintroduced.\r\nIf, after all efforts, no fluid is obtained, another test-meal should\r\nbe given and withdrawn in forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nAs the tube is removed, it should be pinched between the fingers so as\r\nto save any fluid that may be in it.\r\n\r\nThe stomach-tube must be used with great care, or not at all, in cases\r\nof gastric ulcer, aneurysm, uncompensated heart disease, and marked\r\narteriosclerosis. Except in gastric ulcer, the danger lies in the\r\nretching produced, and the tube can safely be used if the patient\r\ntakes it easily.\r\n\r\n{217} B. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, 30 to 50 c.c. of fluid can be obtained one\r\nhour after administering Ewald's breakfast. More than 60 c.c. points\r\nto motor insufficiency; less than 20 c.c., to too rapid emptying of\r\nthe stomach, or else to incomplete removal. Upon standing, it\r\nseparates into two layers, the lower consisting of particles of food,\r\nthe upper of an almost clear, faintly yellow fluid. The extent to\r\nwhich digestion has taken place can be roughly judged from the\r\nappearance of the food-particles.\r\n\r\nThe _reaction_ is frankly acid in health and in nearly all pathologic\r\nconditions. It may be neutral or slightly alkaline in some cases of\r\ngastric cancer and marked chronic gastritis, or when contaminated by a\r\nconsiderable amount of saliva.\r\n\r\nA small amount of _mucus_ is present normally. Large amounts, when the\r\ngastric contents are obtained with the tube and not vomited, point to\r\nchronic gastritis. Mucus is recognized from its characteristic slimy\r\nappearance when the fluid is poured from one vessel into another.\r\n\r\nA trace of _bile_ may be present as a result of excessive straining\r\nwhile the tube is in the stomach. Larger amounts are very rarely\r\nfound, and generally point to obstruction in the duodenum. Bile\r\nproduces a yellowish or greenish discoloration of the fluid.\r\n\r\n_Blood_ is often recognized by simple inspection, but more frequently\r\nrequires a chemic test. It is bright red when very fresh, and dark,\r\nresembling coffee-grounds, when older.\r\n\r\n_Particles of food_ eaten hours, or even days, previously, may be\r\nfound, and indicate deficient motor power.\r\n\r\n{218} Search should always be made for _bits of tissue_ from the\r\ngastric mucous membrane or newgrowths. These, when examined by a\r\npathologist, will sometimes render the diagnosis clear.\r\n\r\nC. CHEMIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nA routine chemic examination of the gastric contents involves\r\nqualitative tests for free acids, free hydrochloric acid, and organic\r\nacids, and quantitative estimations of total acidity, free\r\nhydrochloric acid, and sometimes combined hydrochloric acid. Other\r\ntests are applied when indicated.\r\n\r\n1. Qualitative Tests.--(1) Free Acids.--The presence or absence of\r\nfree acids, without reference to the kind, is easily determined by\r\nmeans of Congo-red.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongo-red Test.--Take a few drops of a strong alcoholic solution of\r\nCongo-red in a test-tube, dilute with water to a strong red color, and\r\nadd a few cubic centimeters of filtered gastric juice. The appearance\r\nof a _blue color_ shows the presence of some free acid (Plate IX, B,\r\nB'). Since the test is more sensitive to mineral than to organic\r\nacids, a marked reaction points to the presence of free hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThick filter-paper soaked in Congo-red solution, dried, and cut into\r\nstrips may be used, but the test is much less delicate when thus\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Free Hydrochloric Acid.--In addition to its digestive function,\r\nfree hydrochloric acid is an efficient antiseptic. It prevents or\r\nretards fermentation and lactic-acid formation, and is an important\r\nmeans of protection against the entrance of pathogenic organisms into\r\nthe body. It is never absent in health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{219} Amidobenzol Test.--To a little of the filtered gastric juice in\r\na test-tube, or to several drops in a porcelain dish, add a drop of\r\n0.5 per cent. alcoholic solution of dimethylamido-azobenzol. In the\r\npresence of free hydrochloric acid there will at once appear a\r\n_cherry-red color_, varying in intensity with the amount of acid\r\n(Plate X, C). This test is very delicate; but, unfortunately, organic\r\nacids, when present in large amounts (above 0.5 per cent.), give a\r\nsimilar reaction.\r\n\r\nBoas' Test.--This test is less delicate than the preceding, but is\r\nmore reliable, since it reacts only to free hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIn a porcelain dish mix a few drops of the gastric juice and the\r\nreagent, and slowly evaporate to dryness over a flame, _taking care\r\nnot to scorch_. The appearance of a _rose-red color_, which fades upon\r\ncooling, shows the presence of free hydrochloric acid (Plate IX, 1).\r\n\r\n_Boas' reagent_ consists of 5 gm. resublimed resorcinol, and 3 gm.\r\ncane-sugar, in 100 c.c. alcohol. The solution keeps well, which, from\r\nthe practitioner's view-point, makes it preferable to Günzburg's\r\nphloroglucin-vanillin reagent (phloroglucin, 2 gm.; vanillin, 1 gm.;\r\nabsolute alcohol, 30 c.c.). The latter is just as delicate, is applied\r\nin the same way, and gives a sharper reaction (Plate IX, 2), but is\r\nunstable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(3) Organic Acids.--Lactic acid is the most common, and is taken as\r\nthe type of the organic acids which appear in the stomach-contents. It\r\nis a product of bacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids are\r\nsometimes present. Their formation is closely connected with that of\r\nlactic acid, and they are rarely tested for. When abundant, they may\r\nbe recognized by their odor upon heating.\r\n\r\nLactic acid is never present at the height of digestion in health.\r\nAlthough usually present early in digestion, it disappears when free\r\nhydrochloric acid begins to appear. {220} Small amounts may be\r\nintroduced with the food. Pathologically, small amounts may be present\r\nwhenever there is stagnation of the gastric contents with deficient\r\nhydrochloric acid, as in many cases of dilatation of the stomach and\r\nchronic gastritis. The presence of notable amounts of lactic acid is\r\nsignificant of gastric cancer, and is probably the most valuable\r\nsingle symptom of the disease. In the great majority of cases\r\ndetection of more than 0.1 per cent. (see Strauss' test) warrants a\r\ndiagnosis of malignancy.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the Ewald test-breakfast introduces a small amount\r\nof lactic acid, but rarely enough to respond to the tests given here.\r\nIn every case, however, in which its detection is important, Boas'\r\ntest-breakfast should be given, the stomach having been thoroughly\r\nwashed the evening before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUffelmann's Test for Lactic Acid.--Thoroughly shake up 5 c.c. of\r\nfiltered stomach fluid with 50 c.c. of ether for at least ten minutes.\r\nCollect the ether and evaporate over a water-bath. Dissolve the\r\nresidue in 5 c.c. water and test with Uffelmann's reagent as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a test-tube mix three drops concentrated solution of phenol and\r\nthree drops saturated aqueous solution of ferric chlorid. Add water\r\nuntil the mixture assumes an amethyst-blue color. To this add the\r\nsolution to be tested. The appearance of a _canary-yellow color_\r\nindicates the presence of lactic acid (Plate IX, A, A').\r\n\r\nUffelmann's test may be applied directly to the stomach-contents\r\nwithout extracting with ether, but is then neither sensitive nor\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nA, Uffelmann's reagent; A', A after the addition of gastric fluid\r\ncontaining lactic acid; B, water to which three drops of Congo-red\r\nsolution have been added; B', change induced in B when gastric fluid\r\ncontaining free hydrochloric acid is added (Boston).\r\n\r\n1, Resorcin-test for free hydrochloric acid; 2, Günzburg's test for\r\nhydrochloric acid (Boston).]\r\n\r\nStrauss' Test for Lactic Acid.--This is the best test for clinical\r\nwork, since it gives a rough idea of the quantity present. Strauss'\r\ninstrument (Fig. 87) is essentially a separating funnel with a mark at\r\n5 c.c. and one at 25 c.c. Fill to the 5 c.c. mark {221} with filtered\r\nstomach fluid, and to the 25 c.c. mark with ether. Shake thoroughly\r\nfor ten or fifteen minutes, let stand until the ether separates, and\r\nthen, by opening the stop-cock, allow the liquid to run out to the\r\n5 c.c. mark. Fill to the 25 c.c. mark with water, and add two drops of\r\ntincture of ferric chlorid diluted 1:10. Shake gently. If 0.1 per\r\ncent. or more lactic acid be present, the water will assume a strong\r\nyellowish-green color. A pale green will appear with 0.05 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Separatory funnel for Strauss' lactic acid\r\ntest (Sahli).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(4) Pepsin and Pepsinogen.--Pepsinogen itself has no digestive power.\r\nIt is secreted by the gastric glands, and is transformed into pepsin\r\nby the action of a free acid. Although pepsin digests proteids best in\r\nthe presence of free hydrochloric acid, it has a slight digestive\r\nactivity in the presence of organic or combined hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\nThe amount is not influenced by neuroses or circulatory disturbances.\r\nAbsence or marked diminution, therefore, indicates organic disease of\r\nthe stomach. It is an important point in diagnosis between functional\r\nand organic conditions. Pepsin is rarely or never absent in the\r\npresence of free hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTest for Pepsin and Pepsinogen.--With a cork-borer cut small cylinders\r\nfrom the coagulated white of an egg, and cut these into discs of\r\nuniform size. The egg should be cooked very slowly, preferably over a\r\nwater-bath, so that the white may be readily digestible. The discs may\r\nbe preserved in glycerin, but must be washed in water before using.\r\n\r\n{222} Place a disc in each of three test-tubes.\r\n\r\nInto tube No. 1 put 10 c.c. distilled water, 5 grains pepsin, U.S.P.,\r\nand 3 drops of the official dilute hydrochloric add.\r\n\r\nInto tube No. 2 put 10 c.c. filtered gastric juice.\r\n\r\nInto tube No. 3 put 10 c.c. filtered gastric juice and 3 drops dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nPlace the tubes in an incubator or warm water for three hours or\r\nlonger. At intervals, observe the extent to which the egg-albumen has\r\nbeen digested. This is recognized by the depth to which the disc has\r\nbecome translucent.\r\n\r\nTube No. 1 is used for comparison, and should show the effect of\r\nnormal gastric juice.\r\n\r\nDigestion of the egg in tube No. 2 indicates the presence of both\r\npepsin and free hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen digestion fails in tube No. 2 and occurs in No. 3, pepsinogen is\r\npresent, having been transformed into pepsin by the hydrochloric acid\r\nadded. Should digestion fail in this tube, both pepsin and pepsinogen\r\nare absent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(5) Rennin and Renninogen.--Rennin is the milk-curdling ferment of the\r\ngastric juice. It is derived from renninogen through the action of\r\nhydrochloric acid. Lime salts also possess the power of transforming\r\nrenninogen into the active ferment.\r\n\r\nDeficiency of rennin has the same significance as deficiency of\r\npepsin, and is more easily recognized. Since the two enzyms are almost\r\ninvariably present or absent together, the test for rennin serves also\r\nas a test for pepsin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTest for Rennin.--Neutralize 5 c.c. filtered gastric juice with very\r\ndilute sodium hydroxid solution; add 5 c.c. fresh milk, and place in\r\nan incubator or in a vessel of water at about 104° F. Coagulation of\r\nthe milk in ten to fifteen minutes shows a normal amount of rennin.\r\nDelayed coagulation denotes a less amount.\r\n\r\n{223} Test for Renninogen.--To 5 c.c. neutralized gastric juice add\r\n2 c.c. of 1 per cent. calcium chlorid solution and 5 c.c. fresh milk,\r\nand place in an incubator. If coagulation occurs, renninogen is\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(6) Blood.--Blood is present in the vomitus in a great variety of\r\nconditions. When found in the fluid removed after a test-meal, it\r\ncommonly points toward ulcer or carcinoma. Blood can be detected in\r\nnearly one-half of the cases of gastric cancer. The presence of\r\nswallowed blood must be excluded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTest for Blood in Stomach-contents.--To 10 c.c. of the fluid add a few\r\ncubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid and shake the mixture\r\nthoroughly with an equal volume of ether. Separate the ether and apply\r\nto it the guaiac test (p. 89); or evaporate and apply the hemin test\r\n(p. 202) to the residue. When brown particles are present in the\r\nfluid, the hemin test should be applied directly to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Quantitative Tests.--(1) Total Acidity.--The acid-reacting\r\nsubstances which contribute to the total acidity are free hydrochloric\r\nacid, combined hydrochloric acid, acid salts, mostly phosphates, and,\r\nin some pathologic conditions, the organic acids. The total acidity is\r\nnormally about 50 to 75 _degrees_ (see method below), or, when\r\nestimated as hydrochloric acid, about 0.2 to 0.3 _per cent._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTöpfer's Method for Total Acidity.--In an evaporating dish or small\r\nbeaker (an \"after-dinner\" coffee-cup is a very convenient substitute)\r\ntake 10 c.c. filtered stomach-contents and add three or four drops of\r\nthe indicator, a 1 per cent. alcoholic solution of phenolphthalein.\r\nWhen the quantity of stomach fluid is small, 5 c.c. may be used, but\r\nresults are less accurate than with a larger amount. Add decinormal\r\nsolution {224} of sodium hydroxid drop by drop from a buret, until the\r\nfluid assumes a rose-red color which does not become deeper upon\r\naddition of another drop (Plate X, A, A'). When this point is reached,\r\nall the acid has been neutralized. The end reaction will be sharper if\r\nthe fluid be saturated with sodium chlorid. A sheet of white paper\r\nbeneath the beaker facilitates recognition of the color change.\r\n\r\nIn clinical work the amount of acidity is expressed by the number of\r\ncubic centimeters of the decinormal sodium hydroxid solution which\r\nwould be required to neutralize 100 c.c. of the gastric juice, each\r\ncubic centimeter representing one _degree_ of acidity. Hence multiply\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of decinormal solution required to\r\nneutralize the 10 c.c. of stomach fluid by ten. This gives the number\r\nof degrees of acidity. The amount may be expressed in terms of\r\nhydrochloric acid, if one remember that each degree is equivalent to\r\n0.00365 per cent. hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Example_.--Suppose that 7 c.c. of decinormal solution were required\r\nto bring about the end reaction in 10 c.c. gastric juice; then\r\n7 X 10 = 70 _degrees_ of acidity; and, expressed in terms of\r\nhydrochloric acid, 70 X 0.00365 = 0.255 _per cent._\r\n\r\nPreparation of decinormal solutions is described in text-books on\r\nchemistry. The practitioner will find it best to have them made by a\r\nchemist, or to purchase from a chemic supply house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X. A, Gastric fluid to which a 1 per cent.\r\nsolution of phenolphthalein has been added; B, gastric fluid to which\r\na 1 per cent. solution of alizarin has been added; C, gastric fluid to\r\nwhich a 0.5 per cent. solution of dimethylamido-azobenzol has been\r\nadded; A', A after titration with a decinormal solution of sodium\r\nhydroxid; B', B after titration with a decinormal solution of sodium\r\nhydroxid; C', C after titration with a decinormal solution of sodium\r\nhydroxid (Boston).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) Hydrochloric Acid.--After the Ewald and Boas test-breakfasts, the\r\namount of free hydrochloric acid varies normally between 25 and 50\r\ndegrees, or about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent. In disease, it may go\r\nconsiderably higher, or may be absent altogether.\r\n\r\nWhen the amount of free hydrochloric acid is normal, organic disease\r\nof the stomach probably does not exist.\r\n\r\n_Increase_ of free hydrochloric acid above 50 degrees {225}\r\n(_hyperchlorhydria_) generally indicates a neurosis, but also occurs\r\nin most cases of gastric ulcer and beginning chronic gastritis.\r\n\r\n_Decrease_ of free hydrochloric acid below 25 degrees\r\n(_hypochlorhydria_) occurs in some neuroses, chronic gastritis, early\r\ncarcinoma, and most conditions associated with general systemic\r\ndepression. Marked variation in the amount at successive examinations\r\nstrongly suggests a neurosis. Too low values are often obtained at the\r\nfirst examination, the patient's dread of the introduction of the tube\r\nprobably inhibiting secretion.\r\n\r\n_Absence_ of free hydrochloric acid (_achlorhydria_) occurs in most\r\ncases of gastric cancer and far-advanced chronic gastritis, in many\r\ncases of pernicious anemia, and, sometimes, in hysteria.\r\n\r\nThe presence of free hydrochloric acid presupposes a normal amount of\r\ncombined hydrochloric acid, hence the combined need not be estimated\r\nwhen the free acid has been found. When, however, free hydrochloric\r\nacid is absent, it is important to know whether any acid is secreted,\r\nand an estimation of the combined acid then becomes of great value.\r\nThe normal average after an Ewald breakfast is about 10 to 15 degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTöpfer's Method for Free Hydrochloric Acid.--In a beaker take 10 c.c.\r\nfiltered stomach fluid and add four drops of the indicator, a 0.5 per\r\ncent. alcoholic solution of dimethylamido-azobenzol. A red color\r\ninstantly appears if free hydrochloric acid be present. Add decinormal\r\nsodium hydroxid solution, drop by drop from a buret, until the last\r\ntrace of red just disappears, and a canary-yellow color takes its\r\nplace (Plate X, C, C'). Read off the number of cubic centimeters of\r\ndecinormal solution added, and calculate the degrees, or {226}\r\npercentage of free hydrochloric acid, as in Töpfer's method for total\r\nacidity.\r\n\r\nWhen it is impossible to obtain sufficient fluid for all the tests, it\r\nwill be found convenient to estimate the free hydrochloric acid and\r\ntotal acidity in the same portion. After finding the free hydrochloric\r\nacid as just described, add four drops phenolphthalein solution, and\r\ncontinue the titration. The amount of decinormal solution used in both\r\ntitrations indicates the total acidity.\r\n\r\nTöpfer's Method for Combined Hydrochloric Acid.--In a beaker take\r\n10 c.c. filtered gastric juice and add four drops of the indicator, a\r\n1 per cent. aqueous solution of sodium alizarin sulphonate. Titrate\r\nwith decinormal sodium hydroxid until the appearance of a\r\nbluish-violet color which does not become deeper upon addition of\r\nanother drop (Plate X, B, B'). It is difficult, without practice, to\r\ndetermine when the right color has been reached. A reddish-violet\r\nappears first. The shade which denotes the end reaction can be\r\nproduced by adding two or three drops of the indicator to 5 c.c. of 1\r\nper cent. sodium carbonate solution.\r\n\r\nCalculate the number of cubic centimeters of decinormal solution which\r\nwould be required for 100 c.c. of stomach fluid. This gives, in\r\ndegrees, _all the acidity except the combined hydrochloric acid_. The\r\ncombined hydrochloric acid is then found by deducting this amount from\r\nthe total acidity, which has been previously determined.\r\n\r\n_Example_.--Suppose that 5 c.c. of decinormal solution were required\r\nto produce the purple color in 10 c.c. gastric juice; then\r\n5 X 10 = 50 = _all the acidity except combined hydrochloric acid_.\r\nSuppose, now, that the total acidity has already been found to be 70\r\ndegrees; then 70 - 50 = 20 _degrees_ of combined hydrochloric acid;\r\nand 20 X 0.00365 = 0.073 _per cent._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(3) Organic Acids.--There is no simple direct quantitative method.\r\nAfter the total acidity has been {227} determined, organic acids may\r\nbe removed from another portion of the gastric filtrate by shaking\r\nthoroughly with an equal volume of neutral ether, allowing the fluids\r\nto separate, and repeating this process until the gastric fluid has\r\nbeen extracted with eight or ten times its volume of ether. The total\r\nacidity is then determined, and the difference between the two\r\ndeterminations indicates the amount of organic acids.\r\n\r\n(4) Pepsin.--No direct method is available. The following is\r\nsufficient for clinical purposes:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHammerschlag's Method.--To the white of an egg add twelve times its\r\nvolume of 0.4 per cent. hydrochloric acid (dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nU.S.P., 4 c.c.; water, 96 c.c.), mix well, and filter. This gives a 1\r\nper cent. egg-albumen solution. Take 10 c.c. of this solution in each\r\nof three tubes or beakers. To _A_ add 5 c.c. gastric juice; to _B_,\r\n5 c.c. water with 0.5 gm. pepsin; to _C_, 5 c.c. water only. Place in\r\nan incubator for an hour and then determine the amount of albumin in\r\neach mixture by Esbach's method. Tube _C_ shows the amount of albumin\r\nin the test-solution. The difference between _C_ and _B_ indicates the\r\namount of albumin which would be digested by normal gastric juice. The\r\ndifference between _C_ and _A_ gives the albumin which is digested by\r\nthe fluid under examination. It has been shown that the amounts of\r\npepsin in two fluids are proportionate to the squares of the products\r\nof digestion. Thus, if the amounts of albumin digested in tubes _A_\r\nand _B_ are to each other as 2 is to 4, the amounts of pepsin are to\r\neach other as 4 is to 16.\r\n\r\nCertain sources of error can be eliminated by diluting the gastric\r\njuice several times before testing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{228} D. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nA drop of unfiltered stomach-contents is placed upon a slide, covered\r\nwith a cover-glass, and examined with the two-thirds and one-sixth\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions little is to be seen except great numbers of\r\nstarch-granules, with an occasional epithelial cell, yeast-cell, or\r\nbacterium. Starch-granules are recognized by their concentric\r\nstriations and the fact that they stain blue with iodin solutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--General view of the gastric contents: _a_,\r\nSquamous epithelial cells from esophagus and mouth; _b_, leukocytes;\r\n_c_, cylindric epithelial cells; _d_, muscle-fibers; _e_, fat-droplets\r\nand fat-crystals; _f_, starch-granules; _g_, chlorophyl-containing\r\nvegetable matters; _h_, vegetable spirals; _i_, bacteria; _k_,\r\nsarcinæ; _l_, budding (yeast) fungi (Jakob).]\r\n\r\nPathologically, remnants of food from previous meals, red\r\nblood-corpuscles, pus-cells, sarcinæ, and excessive numbers of\r\nyeast-cells and bacteria may be encountered (Fig. 88).\r\n\r\nRemnants of food from previous meals indicate deficient gastric\r\nmotility.\r\n\r\nRed Blood-corpuscles.--Blood is best recognized by the chemic tests\r\nalready given. The corpuscles {229} sometimes retain a fairly normal\r\nappearance, but are generally so degenerated that only granular\r\npigment is left.\r\n\r\nPus-cells.--Pus is rarely encountered in the fluid removed after a\r\ntest-meal. Considerable numbers of pus-corpuscles have been found in\r\nsome cases of gastric cancer. Swallowed sputum must always be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nSarcinæ.--These are small spheres arranged in cuboid groups often\r\ncompared to bales of cotton. They frequently form large clumps and are\r\neasily recognized. They stain brown with iodin solution. They signify\r\nfermentation. Their presence is strong evidence against the existence\r\nof gastric cancer, in which disease they rarely occur.\r\n\r\nYeast-cells.--As already stated, a few yeast-cells may be found under\r\nnormal conditions. The presence of considerable numbers is evidence of\r\nfermentation. Their appearance has been described (p. 130). They stain\r\nbrown with iodin solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Boas-Oppler bacillus from case of gastric\r\ncancer (Boston).]\r\n\r\nBacteria.--Numerous bacteria may be encountered, especially in the\r\nabsence of free hydrochloric acid. The _Boas-Oppler bacillus_ is the\r\nonly one of special significance. {230} It occurs in the majority of\r\ncases of cancer, and is rarely found in other conditions. Carcinoma\r\nprobably furnishes a favorable medium for its growth.\r\n\r\nThese bacilli (Fig. 89) are large (5 to 10 µ long), non-motile, and\r\nusually arranged end to end in chains. They stain brown with iodin\r\nsolution, which distinguishes them from _Leptothrix buccalis_ (p.\r\n270), which is not infrequently found in stomach fluid. They also\r\nstain by Gram's method. They are easily seen with the one-sixth\r\nobjective in unstained preparations, but are best recognized with the\r\none-twelfth, after drying some of the fluid upon a cover-glass,\r\nfixing, and staining with Löffler's methylene-blue or by Gram's\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nA few large non-motile bacilli are frequently seen; they cannot be\r\ncalled Boas-Oppler bacilli unless they are numerous and show something\r\nof the typical arrangement.\r\n\r\nE. THE GASTRIC CONTENTS IN DISEASE\r\n\r\nIn the diagnosis of stomach disorders the practitioner must be\r\ncautioned against relying too much upon examinations of the\r\nstomach-contents. A first examination is especially unreliable. Even\r\nwhen repeated examinations are made, the laboratory findings must\r\nnever be considered apart from the clinical signs.\r\n\r\nThe more characteristic findings in certain disorders are suggested\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n1. Dilatation of the Stomach.--Evidences of retention and fermentation\r\nare the chief characteristics of this condition. Hydrochloric acid is\r\ncommonly diminished. Pepsin may be normal or slightly diminished.\r\nLactic acid may be detected in small amounts, but is usually absent\r\nwhen the stomach has been washed before giving the {231} test-meal.\r\nBoth motility and absorptive power are deficient. The microscope\r\ncommonly shows sarcinæ, bacteria, and great numbers of yeast-cells.\r\nRemnants of food from previous meals can be detected with the naked\r\neye or microscopically.\r\n\r\n2. Gastric Neuroses.--The findings are variable. Successive\r\nexaminations may show normal, increased, or diminished hydrochloric\r\nacid, or even entire absence of the free acid. Pepsin is usually\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nIn the neurosis characterized by continuous hypersecretion\r\n(gastrosuccorrhea), 40 c.c. or more of gastric juice can be obtained\r\nfrom the fasting stomach. Should the fluid contain food-particles, it\r\nis probably the result of retention, not hypersecretion.\r\n\r\n3. Chronic Gastritis.--Free hydrochloric acid may be increased in\r\nearly cases. It is generally diminished in well-marked cases, and is\r\noften absent in advanced cases. Lactic acid is often present in\r\ntraces, rarely in notable amount. Secretion of pepsin and rennin is\r\nalways diminished in marked cases. Mucus is frequently present, and is\r\nvery significant of the disease. Motility and absorption are generally\r\ndeficient. Small fragments of mucous membrane may be found, and when\r\nexamined by a pathologist, may occasionally establish the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n4. Achylia Gastrica (Atrophic Gastritis).--This condition may be a\r\nterminal stage of chronic gastritis. It is sometimes associated with\r\nthe blood-picture of pernicious anemia. It gives a great decrease, and\r\nsometimes entire absence of hydrochloric acid and ferments. The total\r\nacidity may be as low as 1 or 2 degrees. Small amounts of lactic acid\r\nmay be present. Absorption and motility are usually not affected.\r\n\r\n{232} 5. Gastric Carcinoma.--As far as the laboratory examination\r\ngoes, the cardinal signs of this disease are absence of free\r\nhydrochloric acid and presence of lactic acid and of the Boas-Oppler\r\nbacillus. These findings are, however, by no means constant.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some substance is produced by the cancer which\r\nneutralizes the free hydrochloric acid, and thus causes it to\r\ndisappear earlier than in other organic diseases of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe presence of lactic acid is the most suggestive single symptom of\r\ngastric cancer. In the great majority of cases its presence in notable\r\namount (0.1 per cent. by Strauss' method) after Boas' breakfast, the\r\nstomach having been washed the evening before, warrants a diagnosis of\r\nmalignancy.\r\n\r\nCarcinoma seems to furnish an especially favorable medium for the\r\ngrowth of the Boas-Oppler bacillus, hence this micro-organism is\r\nfrequently present.\r\n\r\nBlood can be detected in the stomach fluid by the chemic tests in\r\nnearly one-half of the cases, and is more common when the newgrowth is\r\nsituated at the pylorus. Blood is present in the stool in nearly every\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nEvidences of retention and fermentation are the rule in pyloric\r\ncancer. Tumor particles are sometimes found late in the disease.\r\n\r\n6. Gastric Ulcer.--There is excess of free hydrochloric acid in about\r\none-half of the cases. In other cases the acid is normal or\r\ndiminished. Blood is often present. The diagnosis must be based\r\nlargely upon the clinical symptoms, and where ulcer is strongly\r\nsuspected, it is probably unwise to use the stomach-tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n{233} II. ADDITIONAL EXAMINATIONS WHICH GIVE INFORMATION AS TO THE\r\nCONDITION OF THE STOMACH\r\n\r\n1. Absorptive Power of the Stomach.--This is a very unimportant\r\nfunction, only a few substances being absorbed in the stomach. It is\r\ndelayed in most organic diseases of the stomach, especially in\r\ndilatation and carcinoma, but not in neuroses. The test has little\r\npractical value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGive the patient, upon an empty stomach, a three-grain capsule of\r\npotassium iodid with a glass of water, taking care that none of the\r\ndrug adheres to the outside of the capsule. At intervals test the\r\nsaliva for iodids by moistening starch-paper with it and touching with\r\nyellow nitric acid. A blue color shows the presence of an iodid, and\r\nappears normally in ten to fifteen minutes after ingestion of the\r\ncapsule. A longer time denotes delayed absorption.\r\n\r\n_Starch paper_ is prepared by soaking filter-paper in boiled starch\r\nand drying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Motor Power of the Stomach.--This refers to the rapidity with which\r\nthe stomach passes its contents on into the intestine. It is very\r\nimportant: intestinal digestion can compensate for insufficient or\r\nabsent stomach digestion only so long as the motor power is good.\r\n\r\nMotility is impaired to some extent in chronic gastritis. It is\r\nespecially deficient in dilatation of the stomach due to atony of the\r\ngastric wall or to pyloric obstruction, either benign or malignant. It\r\nis increased in most conditions with hyperchlorhydria.\r\n\r\nThe best evidence of deficient motor power is the detection of food in\r\nthe stomach at a time when it should be empty, _e.g._, before\r\nbreakfast in the morning. When more than 60 c.c. of fluid are obtained\r\nwith the tube one hour after a Ewald breakfast, deficient motility may\r\nbe inferred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{234} Ewald's salol test is scarcely so reliable as the above. It\r\ndepends upon the fact that salol is not absorbed until it reaches the\r\nintestine and is decomposed by the alkaline intestinal juices.\r\n\r\nThe patient is given 15 grains of salol with a test-breakfast, and the\r\nurine, passed at intervals thereafter, is tested for salicyluric acid.\r\nA few drops of 10 per cent. ferric chlorid solution are added to a\r\nsmall quantity of the urine. A violet color denotes the presence of\r\nsalicyluric acid. It appears normally in sixty to seventy-five minutes\r\nafter ingestion of the salol. A longer time indicates impaired motor\r\npower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. To Determine Size and Position of Stomach.--After removing the\r\ntest-meal, while the tube is still in place, force quick puffs of air\r\ninto the stomach by compression of the bulb. The puffs can be clearly\r\nheard with a stethoscope over the region of the stomach, and nowhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the patient may be given a dram of sodium bicarbonate in\r\nsolution, followed immediately by the same amount of tartaric acid,\r\nalso in solution; or he may take the two parts of a seidlitz powder\r\nseparately. The carbon dioxid evolved distends the stomach, and its\r\noutline can easily be determined by percussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FECES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs commonly practised, an examination of the feces is limited to a\r\nsearch for intestinal parasites or their ova. Much of value can,\r\nhowever, be learned from other simple examinations, particularly a\r\ncareful inspection. Anything approaching a complete analysis is, on\r\nthe other hand, a waste of time for the clinician.\r\n\r\nThe normal stool is a mixture of--(_a_) Water; (_b_) undigested and\r\nindigestible remnants of food, as starch-granules, particles of meat,\r\nplant-cells and fibers, etc.; (_c_) digested foods, carried out before\r\nabsorption could take place; (_d_) products of the digestive tract, as\r\naltered bile-pigments, mucus, etc.; (_e_) products of decomposition,\r\nas indol, skatol, fatty acids, and various gases; (_f_) epithelial\r\ncells shed from the wall of the intestinal canal; (_g_) harmless\r\nbacteria, which are always present in enormous numbers.\r\n\r\nPathologically, we may find abnormal amounts of normal constituents,\r\nblood, pathogenic bacteria, animal parasites and their ova, and\r\nbiliary and intestinal concretions.\r\n\r\nThe stool to be examined should be passed into a clean vessel, without\r\nadmixture of urine. The offensive odor can be partially overcome with\r\nturpentine or 5 per cent. phenol. When search for _Amoeba coli_ is to\r\nbe made, the vessel must be warm, and the stool kept warm until\r\nexamined; naturally, no disinfectant can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n{236} I. MACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n1. Quantity.--The amount varies greatly with diet and other factors.\r\nThe average is about 100 to 150 gm. in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n2. Frequency.--One or two stools in twenty-four hours may be\r\nconsidered normal, yet one in three or four days is not uncommon with\r\nhealthy persons. The individual habit should be considered in every\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n3. Form and Consistence.--Soft, mushy, or liquid stools follow\r\ncathartics and accompany diarrhea. Copious, purely serous discharges\r\nwithout fecal matter are significant of Asiatic cholera, although\r\nsometimes observed in other conditions. Hard stools accompany\r\nconstipation. Rounded scybalous masses are common in habitual\r\nconstipation, and indicate atony of the muscular coat of the\r\nintestine. Flattened, ribbon-like stools result from some obstruction\r\nin the rectum, generally a tumor or stricture from a healed ulcer,\r\nmost commonly syphilitic. When bleeding piles are absent,\r\nblood-streaks upon such a stool point to carcinoma.\r\n\r\n4. Color.--The normal light or dark-brown color is due chiefly to\r\naltered bile-pigments. The stools of infants are yellow, owing partly\r\nto their milk diet and partly to the presence of unchanged bilirubin.\r\n\r\nDiet and drugs cause marked changes: milk, a light yellow color; cocoa\r\nand chocolate, dark gray; various fruits, reddish or black; iron and\r\nbismuth, dark brown or black; hematoxylin, red; etc.\r\n\r\nPathologically, the color is important. A golden yellow is generally\r\ndue to unchanged bilirubin. Green stools are not uncommon, especially\r\nin diarrheas of childhood. The color is due to biliverdin, or,\r\nsometimes, to {237} chromogenic bacteria. Putty-colored or \"acholic\"\r\nstools occur when bile is deficient, either from obstruction to\r\noutflow or from deficient secretion. The color is due less to absence\r\nof bile-pigments than to presence of fat. Similar stools are common in\r\nconditions like tuberculous peritonitis, which interfere with\r\nabsorption of fats, and in pancreatic disease.\r\n\r\nNotable amounts of blood produce tarry black stools when the source of\r\nthe hemorrhage is the stomach or upper intestine, and a dark brown or\r\nbright red as the source is nearer the rectum. When diarrhea exists,\r\nthe color may be red, even if the source of the blood is high up. Red\r\nstreaks of blood upon the outside of the stool are due to lesions of\r\nrectum or anus.\r\n\r\n5. Odor.--Products of decomposition, chiefly indol and skatol, are\r\nresponsible for the normal offensive odor. A sour odor is normal for\r\nnursing infants, and is noted in mild diarrheas of older children. In\r\nthe severe diarrheas of childhood a putrid odor is common. In adults\r\nstools emitting a very foul stench are suggestive of malignant or\r\nsyphilitic ulceration of the rectum or gangrenous dysentery.\r\n\r\n6. Mucus.--Excessive quantities of mucus are easily detected with the\r\nnaked eye, and signify irritation or inflammation. When the mucus is\r\nsmall in amount and intimately mixed with the stool, the trouble is\r\nprobably in the small intestine. Larger amounts, not well mixed with\r\nfecal matter, indicate inflammation of the large intestine. Stools\r\ncomposed almost wholly of mucus and streaked with blood are the rule\r\nin dysentery, ileocolitis, and intussusception. In the so-called\r\nmucous colic, or membranous enteritis, shreds and ribbons of altered\r\nmucus, sometimes representing complete casts of the bowel, are passed.\r\n\r\n{238} 7. Concretions.--Gall-stones are probably more common than is\r\ngenerally supposed, and should be searched for in every case of\r\nobscure colicky abdominal pain. Intestinal concretions (enteroliths)\r\nare rare.\r\n\r\nConcretions can be found by breaking up the fecal matter in a sieve\r\n(which may be improvised from gauze) while pouring water over it. It\r\nmust be remembered that gall-stones, if soft, may go to pieces in the\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\n8. Animal Parasites.--Segments of tape-worms and the adults and larvæ\r\nof other parasites are often found in the stool. They are best\r\nsearched for in the manner described for concretions. The search\r\nshould be preceded by a vermicide and a brisk purge. Patients\r\nfrequently mistake vegetable tissue (long fibers from poorly\r\nmasticated celery or \"greens,\" cells from orange, etc.) for intestinal\r\nparasites, and the writer has known physicians to make similar\r\nmistakes. Even slight familiarity with the microscopic structure of\r\nvegetable tissue will prevent the chagrin of such errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CHEMIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nComplicated chemic examinations are of little value to the clinician.\r\nCertain tests are, however, important.\r\n\r\n1. Blood.--When present in large amount, blood produces such changes\r\nin the appearance of the stool that it is not likely to be overlooked.\r\nTraces of blood (occult hemorrhage) can be detected only by special\r\ntests. Recognition of occult hemorrhage has its greatest value in\r\ndiagnosis of gastric cancer and ulcer. It is constantly present in\r\npractically every case of gastric cancer, and is always present,\r\nalthough usually intermittently, in ulcer. Traces of blood also\r\naccompany malignant disease of the {239} bowel, the presence of\r\ncertain intestinal parasites, and other conditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDetection of Occult Hemorrhage.--Soften a portion of the stool with\r\nwater, treat with about one-third its volume of glacial acetic acid,\r\nand extract with ether. Should the ether not separate well, add a\r\nlittle alcohol. Apply the guaiac test to the ether as already\r\ndescribed (p. 89).\r\n\r\nIn every case iron-containing medicines must be stopped, and\r\nblood-pigment must be excluded from the food by giving an appropriate\r\ndiet, _e.g._, bread, milk, eggs, and fruit. At the beginning of the\r\nrestricted diet give a dram of powdered charcoal, or 7 grains of\r\ncarmin, so as to mark the corresponding stool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. Bile.--Normally, unaltered bile-pigment is never present in the\r\nfeces of adults. In catarrhal conditions of the small intestine\r\nbilirubin may be carried through unchanged. It may be demonstrated by\r\nfiltering (after mixing with water if the stool be solid) and testing\r\nthe filtrate by Gmelin's method, as described under The Urine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nCare must be exercised in selection of portions for examination. A\r\nrandom search will often reveal nothing of interest. A small bit of\r\nthe stool, or any suspicious-looking particle, is placed upon a slide,\r\nsoftened with water if necessary, and pressed out into a thin layer\r\nwith a cover-glass. A large slide--about 2 by 3 inches--with a\r\ncorrespondingly large cover will be found convenient. Most of the\r\nstructures which it is desired to see can be found with a two-thirds\r\nobjective. Details of structure must be studied with a higher power.\r\n\r\n{240} The bulk of the stool consists of granular débris. Among the\r\nrecognizable structures met in normal and pathologic conditions are:\r\nremnants of food, epithelial cells, pus-corpuscles, red\r\nblood-corpuscles, crystals, bacteria, and ova of animal parasites\r\n(Fig. 90).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Microscopic elements of normal feces: _a_,\r\nMuscle-fibers; _b_, connective tissue; _c_, epithelial cells; _d_,\r\nwhite blood-corpuscles; _e_, spiral vessels of plants; _f_-_h_,\r\nvegetable cells; _i_, plant hairs; _k_, triple phosphate crystals;\r\n_l_, stone cells. Scattered among these elements are micro-organisms\r\nand débris (after v. Jaksch).]\r\n\r\n1. Remnants of Food.--These include a great variety of structures\r\nwhich are very confusing to the student. Considerable study of normal\r\nfeces is necessary for their recognition.\r\n\r\n_Vegetable fibers_ are generally recognized from their spiral\r\nstructure; _vegetable cells_, from their double contour and the\r\nchlorophyl bodies which many of them contain. These cells are apt to\r\nbe mistaken for the ova of parasites. _Starch-granules_ sometimes\r\nretain their original form, but are ordinarily not to be recognized\r\nexcept by their staining reaction. They strike a blue color with\r\nLugol's solution when undigested; a red color, when slightly digested.\r\n_Muscle-fibers_ are yellow, and sometimes appear as short, {241}\r\ntransversely striated cylinders with rather squarely broken ends.\r\nGenerally, the ends are rounded and the striations faint, or only\r\nirregularly round or oval yellow masses are found. _Curds of milk_ are\r\nespecially important in the stools of children. They must be\r\ndistinguished from small masses of _fat_. The latter are soluble in\r\nether, and stain red with Sudan III.\r\n\r\nExcess of any of these structures may result from excessive ingestion\r\nor deficient intestinal digestion.\r\n\r\n2. Epithelial Cells.--A few cells derived from the wall of the\r\nalimentary canal are a constant finding. They show all stages of\r\ndegeneration, and are often unrecognizable. A marked excess has its\r\norigin in a catarrhal condition of some part of the bowel. Squamous\r\ncells come from the anal orifice; otherwise the form of the cells\r\ngives no clue to the location of the lesion.\r\n\r\n3. Pus.--Amounts of pus sufficient to be recognized with the eye alone\r\nindicate rupture of an abscess into the bowel. If well mixed with the\r\nstool, the source is high up, but in such cases the pus is apt to be\r\nmore or less completely digested, and hence unrecognizable. Small\r\namounts, detected only by the microscope, are present in catarrhal and\r\nulcerative conditions of the intestine, the number of pus-cells\r\ncorresponding to the severity and extent of the process.\r\n\r\n4. Blood-corpuscles.--Unaltered red corpuscles are rarely found unless\r\ntheir source is near the anus. Ordinarily, only masses of\r\nblood-pigment can be seen. Blood is best recognized by the chemic\r\ntests (p. 239).\r\n\r\n5. Bacteria.--In health, bacteria constitute about one-third of the\r\nweight of the dried stool. They are beneficial to the organism,\r\nalthough not actually necessary {242} to its existence. It is both\r\ndifficult and unprofitable to identify them. The great majority belong\r\nto the colon bacillus group, and are negative to Gram's method of\r\nstaining.\r\n\r\nIn some pathologic conditions the character of the intestinal flora\r\nchanges so that Gram-staining bacteria very greatly predominate. As\r\nshown by R. Schmidt, of Neusser's clinic in Vienna, this change is\r\nmost constant and most striking in cancer of the stomach, owing to\r\nlarge numbers of Boas-Oppler bacilli, and is of considerable value in\r\ndiagnosis. He believes that a diagnosis of gastric carcinoma should be\r\nvery unwillingly made with an exclusively \"Gram-negative\" stool, while\r\na \"Gram-positive\" stool, due to bacilli (which should also stain brown\r\nwith Lugol's solution), may be taken as very strong evidence of\r\ncancer. A Gram-positive stool due to cocci is suggestive of intestinal\r\nulceration. The technic is the same as when Gram's method is applied\r\nto other material (p. 40), except that the smear is fixed by immersion\r\nin methyl-alcohol for five minutes instead of by heat. Fuchsin is the\r\nbest counter-stain. The deep-purple Gram-staining bacteria stand out\r\nmuch more prominently than the pale-red Gram-negative organisms, and\r\none may be misled into thinking them more numerous even in cases in\r\nwhich they are much in the minority. The number of Boas-Oppler bacilli\r\ncan be increased by administering a few ounces of sugar of milk the\r\nday before the examination.\r\n\r\nOwing to the difficulty of excluding swallowed sputum, the presence of\r\nthe tubercle bacillus is less significant in the feces than in other\r\nmaterial. It may, however, be taken as evidence of intestinal\r\ntuberculosis when clinical signs indicate an intestinal lesion and\r\nreasonable care is {243} exercised in regard to the sputum. Success in\r\nthe search will depend largely upon careful selection of the portion\r\nexamined. A random search will almost surely fail. Whitish or grayish\r\nflakes of mucus or blood-stained or purulent particles should be\r\nspread upon slides or covers and stained by the method given upon p.\r\n127. In the case of rectal ulcers, swabs can be made directly from the\r\nulcerated surface.\r\n\r\n6. Crystals.--Various crystals may be found, but few have any\r\nsignificance. Slender, needle-like crystals of fatty acids and soaps\r\n(Fig. 32) and triple phosphate crystals (Fig. 90) are common.\r\nCharacteristic octahedral crystals of calcium oxalate (Fig. 47) appear\r\nafter ingestion of certain vegetables. Charcot-Leyden crystals (Fig.\r\n6) are not infrequently encountered, and strongly suggest the presence\r\nof intestinal parasites. Yellowish or brown, needle-like or rhombic\r\ncrystals of hematoidin (Fig. 32) may be seen after hemorrhage into the\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\n7. Ova of Parasites.--The stool should be well mixed with water and\r\nallowed to settle. The ova will be found in the upper or middle\r\nportions of the sediment. Descriptions will be found in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{244}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nANIMAL PARASITES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal parasites are common in all countries, but are especially\r\nabundant in the tropics, where almost every native is host for one or\r\nmore varieties. Because of our growing intercourse with these regions,\r\nthe subject is assuming increasing importance in this country. Many\r\nparasites, hitherto comparatively unknown here, will probably become\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nSome parasites produce no symptoms, even when present in large\r\nnumbers. Others cause very serious symptoms. Only those which have\r\nclinical interest will be considered here. The illustrations will give\r\na better idea of their appearance than any description. They belong to\r\nthree classes: I. Protozoa. II. Vermes. III. Arthropoda.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PROTOZOA\r\n\r\n1. Amoeba Coli Dysenteriæ.--This organism is found, often in large\r\nnumbers, in the stools of tropical dysentery and in the pus and walls\r\nof hepatic abscesses associated with dysentery, and is generally\r\nregarded as the cause of the disease. It is a colorless, granular\r\ncell, 20 to 40 µ in diameter (Fig. 91). It contains one or more\r\ndistinct vacuoles; a round nucleus, which ordinarily is obscured by\r\nthe granules; and frequently red blood-corpuscles and bacteria. When\r\nat rest, its shape is spheric; but upon a warm slide it exhibits the\r\ncharacteristic ameboid motion, {245} constantly changing its shape or\r\nmoving slowly about. This motion is its most distinctive feature.\r\nOther amebæ, resembling the pathogenic variety but smaller (10 to 15 µ\r\nin diameter), are sometimes found in normal feces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Amoeba coli in intestinal mucus, with\r\nblood-corpuscles and bacteria (Lösch).]\r\n\r\nWhen the presence of amebæ is suspected, the stool should be passed\r\ninto a warm vessel and kept warm until and during the examination. A\r\nwarm stage can be improvised from a plate of copper with a hole cut in\r\nthe center. This is placed upon the stage of the microscope, and one\r\nof the projecting ends is heated with a small flame. Amebæ are most\r\nlikely to be found in grayish or blood-streaked particles of mucus.\r\nFavorable material for examination can be obtained at one's\r\nconvenience by inserting into the rectum a large catheter with roughly\r\ncut lateral openings. A sufficient amount of mucus or fecal matter\r\nwill usually be brought away by it.\r\n\r\n2. Trichomonas Vaginalis.--The acid discharge of catarrhal vaginitis\r\nsometimes contains this parasite in {246} abundance. It is oval or\r\npear-shaped, one to three times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle\r\nin length, and has a cluster of flagella at one end (Fig. 92). It is\r\nnot unlike a pus-corpuscle in size and general appearance, but is\r\nactively motile. When in motion the flagella are not easily seen. No\r\npathogenic significance is ascribed to it. Other varieties of the\r\ngenus have been found in the feces, the urine, and the sputum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Trichomonas vaginalis (after Kölliker and\r\nScanzoni).]\r\n\r\nA similar but somewhat smaller organism, _Cercomonas hominis_ (Fig.\r\n93), has been found in the feces in a variety of diarrheal conditions\r\nand in from 10 to 25 per cent. of healthy persons in tropical regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Cercomonas hominis: A, Larger variety; B,\r\nsmaller variety (Davaine).]\r\n\r\nIn urine or vaginal discharges these organisms might be mistaken for\r\nspermatozoa by one who is entirely unfamiliar with the appearance of\r\neither.\r\n\r\n3. Paramoecium Coli (Balantidium Coli).--This parasite is an\r\noccasional inhabitant of the colon of man, and sometimes produces\r\ndiarrhea. It is an oval organism, about 0.1 mm. long, is covered with\r\ncilia, and contains {247} a bean-shaped nucleus, two contractile\r\nvacuoles, and variously sized granules (Fig. 94).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Balantidium (Paramoecium) coli (Eichhorst).]\r\n\r\n4. Hemosporidia.--This is a large group of parasites with two\r\nlife-cycles: one in the blood-corpuscles or plasma of a vertebrate\r\nhost--man, mammals, birds, reptiles; the other in the body of some\r\ninsect. The malarial parasite, already described; the organism\r\n(_Pirosoma bigeminum_) producing Texas fever in cattle; and the\r\nquestionable parasite (_Piroplasma hominis_), which has been described\r\nas the cause of \"tick fever\" of Montana, belong to the group.\r\n\r\n5. Trypanosomes have been mentioned (p. 195).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. VERMES\r\n\r\n1. Cestoda.--Tape-worms are very common parasites of both man and the\r\nanimals. The most important are _Tænia saginata_, _Tænia solium_,\r\n_Bothriocephalus latus_, and _Tænia echinococcus_. They all pass a\r\nlarval stage in the body of an intermediate host. In the adult stage\r\nthey consist of a linear series of flat, rectangular segments\r\n(proglottides), at one end of which is a smaller segment, the scolex\r\nor head, especially adapted for attachment to the host. The series\r\nrepresents a colony, of which the {248} scolex is ancestor. The\r\nproglottides are sexually complete individuals, derived from the\r\nscolex by budding. With exception of the immature segments near the\r\nscolex, each contains a uterus filled with ova. The three tape-worms\r\nfirst mentioned are distinguished from one another mainly by the\r\nstructure of the scolex and of the uterus (Fig. 100). The scolex\r\nshould be studied with a low-power objective. The uterus is best seen\r\nby pressing the segment out between two plates of glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Tænia saginata (Eichhorst).]\r\n\r\n(1) Tænia Saginata or Mediocanellata (Fig. 95).--This, the beef\r\ntape-worm, is the common tape-worm of the United States. Its length\r\nsometimes exceeds twenty-five feet. The middle segments measure about\r\none-fourth by one-half inch. The scolex is about the size of a\r\npin-head, and is surrounded by four sucking discs, but has no hooklets\r\n(Fig. 96). The uterus extends along the middle line of the segment and\r\ngives off about twenty branches upon each side (Fig. 100). The larval\r\nstage is passed in the muscles of various animals, especially cattle,\r\nwhere it lies encysted (cysticercus stage).\r\n\r\nThe larva is ingested with the meat, its capsule is {249} dissolved by\r\nthe digestive juices, and it attaches itself to the intestinal wall by\r\nmeans of its suckers. It then develops into the mature worm.\r\n\r\nThe ova are present in the stools of infected persons, often in great\r\nnumbers. They are spheric or ovoid, yellow in color, and have a thick,\r\nradially striated shell (Fig. 101). Their greatest diameter is 30 to\r\n40 µ (about four or five times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle).\r\nVegetable cells, which are generally present in the feces, are often\r\nmistaken for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Head of Tænia saginata (Mosler and Peiper).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Head of Tænia solium (Mosler and Peiper).]\r\n\r\n(2) Tænia solium, the pork tape-worm is very rare in this country. It\r\nis usually much shorter than _Tænia saginata_. The scolex is\r\nsurrounded by four sucking discs, and has a projection, or rostellum,\r\nwith a double row of horny hooklets (Fig. 97). The uterus has only\r\nseven to ten branches (Fig. 100).\r\n\r\nThe ova closely resemble those of _Tænia saginata_, but are a little\r\nsmaller (Fig. 101).\r\n\r\n(3) Bothriocephalus latus, the fish tape-worm, is the largest parasite\r\nof man, sometimes reaching fifty feet in {250} length, although\r\ngenerally not more than half so long. It is common in some countries\r\nof Europe and in Japan, but is very rare in this country. The head is\r\nnot unlike the bowl of a spoon in shape. It is unprovided with either\r\nsuckers or hooklets, but has two longitudinal grooves which serve the\r\nsame purpose (Fig. 98). The uterus, which is situated in the center of\r\nthe segment, is roset-shaped (Fig. 100).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Head of Bothriocephalus latus: _a_, _a_,\r\nBothridies; _b_, neck (Blanchard).]\r\n\r\nThe larval stage is found in fish, especially the pike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Egg of Bothriocephalus latus, showing lid and\r\nyolk granules (photograph by F. C. Wood).]\r\n\r\nThe ova are characteristic. They measure about 45 by 70 µ, are brown\r\nin color, and are filled with small spherules. The shell is thin, and\r\nhas a small hinged lid at one end (Fig. 99).\r\n\r\n{251} Bothriocephalus latus is interesting clinically because it often\r\ncauses a very severe grade of anemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Segments of--(1) Tænia saginata; (2)\r\nBothriocephalus latus; (3) Tænia solium, showing arrangement of\r\nuterus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Comparative size of eggs of intestinal\r\nparasites: _a_, Tænia solium; _b_, Tænia saginata; _c_, Ascaris\r\nlumbricoides; _d_, Trichocephalus dispar; _e_, Oxyuris vermicularis\r\n(after Strümpell).]\r\n\r\n(4) Tænia Echinococcus.--The mature form of this tape-worm inhabits\r\nthe intestine of the dog and wolf. The larvæ develop in cattle and\r\nsheep ordinarily, but are {252} sometimes found in man, where they\r\ngive rise to echinococcus or \"hydatid\" disease. The condition is\r\nunusual in America, but is common in Iceland and Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Tænia echinococcus; enlarged (Mosler and\r\nPeiper).]\r\n\r\nThe adult parasite is 2.5 to 5 mm. long, and consists of only four\r\nsegments (Fig. 102). It contains many ova. When the ova reach the\r\ndigestive tract of man, the embryos are set free and find their way to\r\nthe liver, lung, or other organ, where they develop into cysts, thus\r\nlosing their identity. Other cysts, called \"daughter cysts,\" are\r\nformed within these. The cyst-wall is made up of two layers, from the\r\ninner of which develop larvæ which are identical with the head, or\r\nscolex, of the mature parasite. These are ovoid structures about 0.3\r\nmm. long. Each has four lateral suckers and a rostellum surmounted by\r\na double circular row of horny hooklets. The rostellum with its\r\nhooklets is frequently invaginated into the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Contents of echinococcus cyst, showing\r\nhooklets, scolices, and cholesterin crystals (Wood).]\r\n\r\nDiagnosis of echinococcus disease depends upon detection of scolices,\r\nfree hooklets, or particles of cyst-wall, which is characteristically\r\nlaminated and usually has {253} curled edges. These can be found in\r\nfluid withdrawn from the cysts, or, less frequently, in the sputum or\r\nthe urine when the disease involves the lung or kidney (Figs. 55 and\r\n103).\r\n\r\nThe cyst-fluid is clear, between 1.002 and 1.010 in specific gravity,\r\nand contains a notable amount of sodium chlorid, but no albumin.\r\n\r\n2. Nematoda.--(1) Ascaris Lumbricoides.--The female is 20 to 40 cm.\r\nlong and about 6 mm. thick; the male, a little more than half as\r\nlarge. Their color is reddish or brown. They are the common\r\n\"round-worms\" so frequently found in children. Their habitat is the\r\nsmall intestine. Large numbers are sometimes present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Ascaris lumbricoides (female) (Mosler and\r\nPeiper).]\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is made by detection of the worms or ova in the feces.\r\nThe latter are generally numerous. They are elliptic, measuring about\r\n50 by 70 µ, and have an unsegmented protoplasm (Fig. 105). The shell\r\nis thick, and is surrounded by an uneven gelatinous envelop which is\r\noften stained with bile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides (Mosler and\r\nPeiper).]\r\n\r\n(2) Oxyuris Vermicularis.--This is the \"thread-worm\" or \"pin-worm\"\r\nwhich inhabits the colon and rectum, especially of young children. Its\r\npresence should {254} be suspected in all unexplained cases of\r\npruritus ani. The female is about 1 cm. long; the male, about 0.6 cm.\r\n(Fig. 106).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Oxyuris vermicularis and egg: _a_, Natural\r\nsize; _b_, egg (after Heller).]\r\n\r\nThe worms are not infrequently found in the feces; the ova, rarely.\r\nThe latter are best found by scraping the skin at the margins of the\r\nanus, where they are deposited by the female. They are asymmetrically\r\noval, about 50 µ in length, and often contain a partially developed\r\nembryo.\r\n\r\n(3) Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.--A description of this worm will be\r\nfound in the chapter upon the Blood, p. 194. The embryos are sometimes\r\nfound in urine and chylous fluids from the serous cavities. Their\r\nmotion is then usually less active than when in blood. That shown in\r\nFig. 107 was alive sixty hours after removal of the fluid. Embryos\r\nwere present in the blood of the same patient.\r\n\r\n{255} [Illustration: FIG. 107.--Filaria sanguinis hominis (embryo) in\r\nchylous hydrocele fluid; length, 300 µ; width, 8 µ. A number of red\r\nblood-corpuscles also appear (studied through courtesy of Dr. S. D.\r\nVan Meter).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Trichinella spiralis (larvæ) from head of\r\nright gastrocnemius muscle; seventh week of disease (two-thirds\r\nobjective; eye-piece 4) (Boston).]\r\n\r\n(4) Trichina (Trichinella) Spiralis.--This is a very small worm, not\r\nexceeding 3 mm. in length when fully developed. Infection in man\r\noccurs from ingestion of insufficiently cooked pork, which contains\r\nencysted embryos. These reach maturity in the small intestine. The\r\nfemale produces great numbers of young, which {256} migrate to the\r\nvoluntary muscles, chiefly near the tendinous extremities, and there\r\nbecome encysted.\r\n\r\nTrichiniasis is generally accompanied by a marked eosinophilia. The\r\ndiagnosis is made by teasing out upon a slide a bit of muscle,\r\nobtained preferably from the outer head of the gastrocnemius, the\r\ninsertion of the deltoid, or the lower portion of the biceps. The\r\ncoiled embryos can easily be seen with a two-thirds objective (Fig.\r\n108).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Uncinaria duodenalis: _a_, Male (natural\r\nsize); _b_, female (natural size); _c_, male (enlarged); _d_, female\r\n(enlarged); _e_, head; _f_, _f_, _f_, eggs (after v. Jaksch).]\r\n\r\n(5) Uncinaria.--The two varieties of this worm, _Uncinaria duodenalis_\r\nand _Uncinaria Americana_, are among the more harmful of the animal\r\nparasites. They inhabit the small intestine, usually in great numbers,\r\nand commonly produce a severe and often fatal anemia. Infection is\r\ncommon in subtropical regions, notably in Egypt, in some European\r\ncountries, and, especially, in Porto Rico and the West Indies, where\r\nabout 90 per cent. of the rural population is infected. It is much\r\nmore {257} common in the United States than was formerly supposed.\r\n\r\nThe adult worms are seldom found in the feces, but may appear after a\r\ndose of thymol followed by a brisk purge. They resemble _Oxyuris\r\nvermicularis_ to the naked eye. Ova are usually present in enormous\r\nnumbers. Those of _Uncinaria duodenalis_ measure about 30 by 50 µ; of\r\n_Uncinaria Americana_, somewhat more. They have a thin, smooth,\r\ntransparent shell, and their protoplasm is divided into 2, 4, 8, or\r\nmore rounded segments (Fig. 110).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Four eggs of the New World hook-worm\r\n(Uncinaria Americana), in the one-, two-, and four-cell stages. The\r\negg showing three cells is a lateral view of a four-cell stage.\r\nGreatly enlarged (after Stiles).]\r\n\r\n(6) Strongyloides Intestinalis.--Infection with this worm is by no\r\nmeans so rare in this country as the few clinical reports would\r\nindicate. It is very common in subtropical countries, notably in Italy\r\nand in southern China. It seems probable that the parasite is the\r\ncause {258} of \"Cochin China diarrhea,\" although some authorities\r\nregard it as harmless.\r\n\r\nThe adult worm, which reproduces by parthenogenesis, is about 2 mm.\r\nlong. It inhabits the upper portion of the small intestine, but\r\nneither it nor the ova appear in the stool unless an active diarrhea\r\nexists. Ordinarily the eggs hatch in the intestine, and when infection\r\nis severe, embryos can be found in the feces in large numbers. These\r\nare the \"rhabditiform embryos,\" which measure about 0.40 by 0.02 mm.\r\nThey are actively motile, and are best found by making a small\r\ndepression in the fecal mass, filling it with water, and standing in a\r\nwarm place (preferably an incubator) for twelve to twenty-four hours.\r\nThe embryos will collect in the water, and can be easily found with a\r\ntwo-thirds objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Strongyloides intestinalis: A, Mature\r\nfemale; B, rhabditiform larva; C, filariform larva (after Braun).]\r\n\r\nOutside the body the rhabditiform embryos develop into a free-living,\r\nsexually differentiated generation. The young of this generation are\r\nthe more slender \"filariform embryos\" (Fig. 111). Infection can occur\r\neither through these embryos of the free-living generation, or by\r\ndirect transformation of rhabditiform into filariform embryos and\r\nthese into the parthenogenic parasitic adult.\r\n\r\n(7) Trichocephalus Dispar (T. Trichiurus).--This, {259} the\r\n\"whip-worm,\" is 4 or 5 cm. long. Its anterior portion is slender and\r\nthread-like, while the posterior portion is thicker (Fig. 112). It is\r\nwidely distributed geographically, and is one of the most common of\r\nintestinal parasites in this country. It lives in the large intestine,\r\nespecially the cecum, with its slender extremity embedded in the\r\nmucous membrane. Whip-worms do not, as a rule, produce any symptoms,\r\nalthough gastro-intestinal disturbances, nervous symptoms, and anemia\r\nhave been ascribed to them. They, as well as many other intestinal\r\nparasites, are probably an important factor in etiology of\r\nappendicitis, typhoid fever, and other intestinal infections. The\r\ndamage which they do to the mucous membrane favors bacterial invasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Trichocephalus dispar; _a_, Female; _b_,\r\nmale (natural size) (Heller).]\r\n\r\nThe number present is usually small. The worms themselves are rarely\r\nfound in the feces. The ova, which are not often abundant, are easily\r\nrecognized. They are brown, ovoid in shape, about 50 µ long, and have\r\na button-like projection at each end (Fig. 101).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ARTHROPODA\r\n\r\nMost of these are external parasites, and the reader is referred to\r\nthe standard works upon diseases of the skin for descriptions. The\r\nitch-mite (_Acarus scabiei_) and the louse (_Pediculus capitis_,\r\n_corporis_, _vel pubis_) are the more common members of the group.\r\n\r\n{260} A number of flies may deposit their ova in wounds or in such of\r\nthe body cavities as they can reach, and the resulting maggots may\r\ncause intense irritation. Ova may be swallowed with the food and the\r\nmaggots appear in the feces. Probably most important is the \"screw\r\nworm,\" the larva of _Compsomyia macellaria_, infection with which is\r\nnot rare in some parts of the United States. The ova are most commonly\r\ndeposited in the nasal passages, and the larvæ, which may be present\r\nin great numbers, burrow through the soft parts, cartilage, and even\r\nbone, always with serious and often with fatal results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPUS\r\n\r\nPus contains much granular débris and numerous more or less\r\ndegenerated cells, the great majority being polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytes--so-called \"pus-corpuscles.\" Eosinophilic leukocytes are\r\ncommon in gonorrheal pus and in asthmatic sputum. Examination of pus\r\nis directed chiefly to detection of bacteria.\r\n\r\nWhen very few bacteria are present, culture methods must be resorted\r\nto, but such methods do not come within the scope of this work. When\r\nconsiderable numbers are present, they can be detected and often\r\nidentified in cover-glass smears. Several smears should be made,\r\ndried, and fixed as described under Sputum (p. 32). One of these\r\nshould be stained one-fourth to one-half minute with Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue, rinsed well with water, dried, mounted, and examined\r\nwith an oil-immersion lens. This will show all bacteria except the\r\ntubercle bacillus, and often no other stain is necessary for their\r\nidentification. In many cases special stains must be applied.\r\n\r\n_Gram's method_ (p. 40) is a very useful aid in distinguishing certain\r\nbacteria. The more important organisms react to this staining method\r\nas follows: {262}\r\n\r\n    GRAM STAINING                  GRAM DECOLORIZING\r\n    (Deep purple).

They are both cocci, or spheres, their average\r\ndiameter being about 1 µ. Staphylococci are commonly grouped in\r\nclusters, often compared to bunches of grapes (Fig. 113). There are\r\nseveral varieties, which can be distinguished only in cultures.\r\nStreptococci are arranged side by side, forming chains of variable\r\nlength (Fig. 114). Sometimes there are only three or four individuals\r\nin a chain; sometimes a chain {263} is so long as to extend across\r\nseveral microscopic fields. Streptococci are more virulent than\r\nstaphylococci, and are less common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Streptococcus pyogenes from a case of\r\nempyema (Jakob).]\r\n\r\nShould bacteria resembling _pneumococci_ be found, Buerger's method\r\n(p. 37) should be tried. When it is inconvenient to stain before the\r\nsmears have dried, capsules can be shown by the method of Hiss. The\r\ndried and fixed smear is covered with a stain composed of 5 c.c.\r\nsaturated alcoholic solution gentian-violet and 95 c.c. distilled\r\nwater, and heated until steam rises. The preparation is then washed\r\nwith 20 per cent. solution of copper sulphate, dried, and mounted in\r\nCanada balsam.\r\n\r\nPneumococci may give rise to inflammations in many locations. When\r\nthey form short chains, demonstration of the capsule is necessary to\r\ndistinguish them from streptococci.\r\n\r\nIf tuberculosis be suspected, the smears should be stained by one of\r\nthe methods for the _tubercle bacillus_ (pp. 32 and 127), or\r\nguinea-pigs may be inoculated. {264} The bacilli are generally\r\ndifficult to find in pus, and bacteria-free pus would suggest\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Diplococcus pneumoniæ from ulcer of cornea\r\n(obj. one-twelfth oil-immersion) (study through courtesy of Dr. C. A.\r\nOliver) (Boston).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Gonococci in urethral pus (McFarland).]\r\n\r\n_Gonococci_, when typical, can usually be identified with sufficient\r\ncertainty for clinical purposes in the smear stained with Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue. They are coffee-bean-shaped cocci which lie in pairs\r\nwith their flat surfaces together (Fig. 116). They lie for the most\r\npart within pus-cells, an occasional cell being filled with them,\r\nwhile the surrounding cells contain few or none. A few are {265} found\r\noutside of the cells. It is not usual to find gonococci when many\r\nother bacteria are present, even though the pus is primarily of\r\ngonorrheal origin. Whenever the identity of the organism is at all\r\nquestionable, Gram's method should be tried. In rare instances it may\r\nbe necessary to resort to cultures. The gonococcus is distinguished by\r\nits failure to grow upon ordinary media.\r\n\r\nGonococci are generally easily found in pus from untreated acute and\r\nsubacute gonorrheal inflammations,--conjunctivitis, urethritis,\r\netc.,--but are found with difficulty in pus from chronic inflammations\r\nand abscesses, and in urinary sediments.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONEAL, PLEURAL, AND PERICARDIAL FLUIDS\r\n\r\nThe serous cavities contain very little fluid normally, but\r\nconsiderable quantities are frequently present as a result of\r\npathologic conditions. The pathologic fluids are classed as\r\ntransudates and exudates.\r\n\r\n_Transudates_ are non-inflammatory in origin. They contain only a few\r\ncells, and less than 2.5 per cent. of albumin, and do not coagulate\r\nspontaneously. The specific gravity is below 1018. Micro-organisms are\r\nseldom present.\r\n\r\n_Exudates_ are of inflammatory origin. They are richer in cells and\r\nalbumin, and tend to coagulate upon standing. The specific gravity is\r\nabove 1018. Bacteria are generally present, and often numerous. The\r\namount of albumin is estimated by Esbach's method, after diluting the\r\nfluid. Bacteria are recognized by cultures, animal inoculation, or\r\nstained smears.\r\n\r\nExudates are usually classed as serous, serofibrinous, seropurulent,\r\npurulent, putrid, and hemorrhagic, which {266} terms require no\r\nexplanation. In addition, chylous and chyloid exudates are\r\noccasionally met, particularly in the peritoneal cavity. In the\r\nchylous form the milkiness is due mainly to the presence of minute\r\nfat-droplets, and is the result of rupture of a lymph-vessel. Chyloid\r\nexudates are milky chiefly from proteids in suspension, or fine débris\r\nfrom broken-down cells. These exudates are most frequently seen in\r\ncarcinoma and tuberculosis of the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nCytodiagnosis.--This consists in a differential count of the cells in\r\na transudate or exudate, particularly one of pleural or peritoneal\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Cytodiagnosis. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes\r\nand swollen endothelial cells from acute infectious non-tuberculous\r\npleuritis (Percy Musgrave; photo by L. S. Brown).]\r\n\r\nThe fresh fluid, obtained by aspiration, is centrifugalized for at\r\nleast five minutes; the supernatant liquid is poured off; and\r\ncover-glass smears are made and dried in the air. The smears are then\r\nstained with Wright's blood-stain, to which one-third its volume of\r\npure methyl-alcohol has {267} been added. Cover the smear with this\r\nfluid for one-half minute, then dilute with eight or ten drops of\r\nwater, and let stand about two minutes. Wash gently in water, and\r\n{268} dry by holding the cover-glass between the fingers over a flame.\r\nMount in balsam and examine with a one-twelfth objective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Cytodiagnosis. Lymphoid cells from pleural\r\nfluid; case of tuberculous pleuritis (Percy Musgrave; photo by L. S.\r\nBrown).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Cytodiagnosis. Endothelial cells from\r\ntransudate or mechanical effusion (Percy Musgrave; photo by L. S.\r\nBrown).]\r\n\r\nPredominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pus-corpuscles) points\r\nto an acute infectious process (Fig. 117).\r\n\r\nPredominance of lymphocytes (Fig. 118) generally signifies\r\ntuberculosis. Tuberculous pleurisy due to direct extension from the\r\nlung may give excess of polymorphonuclears owing to mixed infection.\r\n\r\nPredominance of endothelial cells, few cells of any kind being\r\npresent, indicates a transudate (Fig. 119). Endothelial cells\r\ngenerally predominate in carcinoma, but are accompanied by\r\nconsiderable numbers of lymphocytes and red blood-corpuscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREBROSPINAL FLUID\r\n\r\nExamination of the fluid obtained by lumbar puncture is of value in\r\ndiagnosis of certain forms of meningitis.\r\n\r\n_Tubercle bacilli_ can be found in the majority of cases of\r\ntuberculous meningitis. The sediment, obtained by thorough\r\ncentrifugalization or by coagulation and digestion (p. 128) is spread\r\nupon slides and stained by one of the methods already given. A\r\nconsiderable number of smears should be examined. In doubtful cases,\r\ninoculation of guinea-pigs must be resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe _Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis_ is recognized as the\r\ncause of epidemic cerebrospinal fever, and can be detected in the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid of most cases, especially those which run an acute\r\ncourse. Cover-glass smears from the sediment should be stained by the\r\nmethod for the gonococcus. The meningococcus is an intracellular\r\ndiplococcus which often cannot be distinguished {269} from the\r\ngonococcus in stained smears (Fig. 120). It, also, decolorizes by\r\nGram's method. The presence of such a diplococcus in meningeal\r\nexudates is, however, sufficient for its identification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis in\r\nleukocytes. X2000 (Wright and Brown).]\r\n\r\nVarious organisms have been found in other forms of meningitis--the\r\npneumococcus most frequently. In some cases no micro-organisms can be\r\ndetected even by culture methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL INOCULATION\r\n\r\nInoculation of animals is one of the most reliable means of verifying\r\nthe presence of certain micro-organisms in fluids and other material.\r\n\r\nClinically, it is applied almost exclusively to demonstration of the\r\ntubercle bacillus when other means have {270} failed or are uncertain.\r\nThe guinea-pig is the most suitable animal for this purpose. When the\r\nsuspected material is fluid and contains pus, it should be well\r\ncentrifugalized, and one or two cubic centimeters of the sediment\r\ninjected by means of a large hypodermic needle into the peritoneal\r\ncavity or underneath the loose skin of the groin. Fluids from which no\r\nsediment can be obtained must be injected directly into the peritoneal\r\ncavity, since at least 10 c.c. are required, which is too great an\r\namount to inject hypodermically. Solid material should be placed in a\r\npocket made by snipping the skin of the groin with scissors, and\r\nfreeing it from the underlying tissues for a short distance around the\r\nopening. When the intraperitoneal method is selected, several animals\r\nmust be inoculated, since some are likely to die from peritonitis\r\ncaused by other organisms before the tubercle bacillus has had time to\r\nproduce its characteristic lesions.\r\n\r\nThe animals should be killed at the end of six or eight weeks, if they\r\ndo not die before that time, and a careful postmortem examination\r\nshould be made for the characteristic pearly-gray or yellow tubercles\r\nscattered over the peritoneum and through the abdominal organs,\r\nparticularly the spleen, and for caseous inguinal and retroperitoneal\r\nlymph-glands. The tubercles and portions of the caseous glands should\r\nbe crushed between two slides, dried, and stained for tubercle\r\nbacilli. The bacilli are difficult to find in the caseous material.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUTH\r\n\r\nMicro-organisms are always present in large numbers. Among these is\r\n_Leptothrix buccalis_ (Fig. 121), which is especially abundant in the\r\ncrypts of the tonsils and the {271} tartar of the teeth. The whitish\r\npatches of _pharyngomycosis leptothrica_ are largely composed of these\r\nfungi. They are slender, segmented threads, which generally, but not\r\nalways, stain violet with Lugol's solution, and are readily seen with\r\na one-sixth objective. At times they are observed in the sputum and\r\nstomach fluid. In the former they might be mistaken for elastic\r\nfibers; in the latter, for Boas-Oppler bacilli. In either case, the\r\nreaction with iodin will distinguish them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Gingival deposit (unstained): _a_, Squamous\r\nepithelial cells; _b_, leukocytes; _c_, bacteria; _d_, Leptothrix\r\nbuccalis (Jakob).]\r\n\r\nThrush is a disease of the mouth seen most often in children, and\r\ncharacterized by the presence of white patches upon the mucous\r\nmembrane. It is caused by the thrush fungus, _Oïdium albicans_. When a\r\nbit from one of the patches is pressed out between a slide and cover\r\nand examined with a one-sixth objective, the fungus is seen to consist\r\nof a network of branching segmented hyphæ with numerous spores, both\r\nwithin the hyphæ and in the meshes between them (Fig. 122). The meshes\r\nalso contain leukocytes, epithelial cells, and granular débris.\r\n\r\n{272} [Illustration: FIG. 122.--Thrush fungus (Oïdium albicans)\r\n(Jakob).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Bacillus diphtheriæ, from culture on\r\nblood-serum. X1000 (Fränkel and Pfeiffer).]\r\n\r\nAcute pseudomembranous inflammations, which occur chiefly upon the\r\ntonsils and nasopharynx, are generally caused by the diphtheria\r\nbacillus, but may result from streptococcic infection. In many cases\r\ndiphtheria {273} bacilli can be demonstrated in smears made from the\r\nmembrane and stained with Löffler's methylene-blue or 2 per cent.\r\naqueous solution of methyl-green. They are straight or curved rods,\r\nwhich vary markedly in size and outline, and stain very irregularly\r\n(Fig. 123). A characteristic form is a palely tinted rod with several\r\ndeeply stained granules (metachromatic bodies), or with one such\r\ngranule at each end. They stain by Gram's method. It is generally\r\nnecessary, and always safer, to make a culture upon blood-serum,\r\nincubate for twelve hours, and examine smears from the growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Bacillus and spirillum of Vincent, from case\r\nof ulcerative stomatitis. Stained (obj. one-twelfth oil-immersion;\r\nX1000) (Boston).]\r\n\r\nVincent's angina is a chronic pseudomembranous and ulcerative\r\ninflammation of pharynx and tonsils. It is probably caused by two\r\nmicro-organisms living in symbiosis--one a fusiform bacillus, the\r\nother a long spirillum (Fig. 124). They can readily be demonstrated in\r\nsmears stained with Löffler's methylene-blue. The bacillus is spindle\r\nshaped, more or less pointed at the {274} ends, and about 6 to 12 µ\r\nlong. The spirillum is a very slender, wavy thread, about 30 to 40 µ\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nTuberculous ulcerations of mouth and pharynx can generally be\r\ndiagnosed from curetings made after careful cleansing of the surface.\r\nThe curetings are well rubbed between slide and cover, and the smears\r\nthus made are dried, fixed, and stained for tubercle bacilli. Since\r\nthere is much danger of contamination from tuberculous sputum, the\r\npresence of tubercle bacilli is significant only in proportion to the\r\nthoroughness with which the ulcer was cleansed. The diagnosis is\r\ncertain when the bacilli are found within groups of cells which have\r\nnot been disassociated in making the smears.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Conjunctival secretion from acute contagious\r\nconjunctivitis; polynuclear leukocytes with the bacillus of Weeks; P,\r\nphagocyte containing bacillus of Weeks (one-twelfth oil-immersion;\r\nocular iii) (Morax).]\r\n\r\n_Staphylococci_, _pneumococci_, and _streptococci_ are probably the\r\nmost common of the bacteria to be found in nonspecific conjunctivitis\r\nand keratitis. The usual cause of acute infectious conjunctivitis,\r\nespecially in cities, seems to be the _Koch-Weeks bacillus_. This is a\r\nminute, slender rod, which lies within and between the pus-corpuscles\r\n(Fig. 125), and is negative to Gram's stain. In smears it cannot be\r\n{275} distinguished from the influenza bacillus, although its length\r\nis somewhat greater. The _diplobacillus of Morax and Axenfeld_ gives\r\nrise to an acute or chronic blepharo-conjunctivitis without follicles\r\nor membrane, for which zinc sulphate seems to be a specific. It is\r\nwidely distributed geographically, and is common in many regions. The\r\norganism is a short, thick diplobacillus, is frequently intracellular,\r\nand is Gram-negative (Fig. 126). A delicate capsule can sometimes be\r\nmade out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--The diplobacillus of Morax and Axenfeld\r\n(from a preparation by Dr. Harold Gifford).]\r\n\r\nEarly diagnosis of gonorrheal ophthalmia is extremely important, and\r\ncan be made with certainty only by detection of _gonococci_ in the\r\ndischarge. They are easily found in smears from untreated cases. After\r\ntreatment is begun they soon disappear, even though the discharge\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\nPseudomembranous conjunctivitis generally shows either _streptococci_\r\nor _diphtheria bacilli_. In diagnosing diphtheric conjunctivitis, one\r\nmust be on his guard against the {276} _xerosis bacillus_, which is a\r\nfrequent inhabitant of the conjunctival sac in healthy persons, and\r\nwhich is identical morphologically with the diphtheria bacillus. The\r\nclinical picture is hence more significant than the microscopic\r\nfindings.\r\n\r\nVarious micro-organisms--bacteria, molds, protozoa--have been\r\ndescribed in connection with trachoma, but the specific organism of\r\nthe disease is not definitely known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAR\r\n\r\nBy far the most frequent exciting causes of acute otitis media are the\r\npneumococcus and the streptococcus. The finding of other bacteria in\r\nthe discharge generally indicates a secondary infection, except in\r\ncases complicating infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever,\r\ndiphtheria, and influenza. Discharges which have continued for some\r\ntime are practically always contaminated with the staphylococcus. The\r\npresence of the streptococcus should be a cause of uneasiness, since\r\nit much more frequently leads to mastoid disease and meningitis than\r\ndoes the pneumococcus. The staphylococcus, bacillus of Friedländer,\r\ncolon bacillus, and Bacillus pyocyaneus may be met in chronic\r\nmiddle-ear disease.\r\n\r\nIn tuberculous disease the tubercle bacillus is present in the\r\ndischarge, but its detection offers some difficulties. It is rarely\r\neasy to find, and precautions must always be taken to exclude the\r\nsmegma and other acid-fast bacilli (p. 35), which are especially\r\nliable to be present in the ear. Rather striking is the tendency of\r\nold squamous cells to retain the red stain, and fragments of such\r\ncells may mislead the unwary.\r\n\r\n\r\n{277} PARASITIC DISEASES OF THE SKIN\r\n\r\nFavus, tinea versicolor, and the various forms of ring-worm are caused\r\nby members of the fungus group. To demonstrate them, a crust or a hair\r\nfrom the affected area is softened with a few drops of 20 per cent.\r\ncaustic soda solution, pressed out between a slide and cover, and\r\nexamined with a one-sixth objective. They consist of a more or less\r\ndense network of hyphæ and numerous round or oval refractive spores.\r\nThe cuts in standard works upon diseases of the skin will aid in\r\ndifferentiating the members of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK\r\n\r\nA large number of analyses of human and cow's milk are averaged by\r\nHolt as follows, Jersey milk being excluded because of its excessive\r\nfat:\r\n\r\n                         HUMAN MILK.

The specific gravity of each is about 1.028 to 1.032.\r\nHuman milk is sterile when secreted, but derives a few bacteria from\r\nthe lacteal ducts. Cow's milk, as usually sold, contains large numbers\r\nof bacteria. Microscopically, human milk is a fairly homogeneous\r\nemulsion of fat, and is practically destitute of cellular elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Holt's milk-testing apparatus.]\r\n\r\nChemic examination of milk is of great value in solving {278} the\r\nproblems of infant feeding. The sample examined should be the middle\r\nmilk, or the entire quantity from one breast. The fat and proteid can\r\nbe estimated roughly, but accurately enough for many clinical\r\npurposes, by means of Holt's apparatus, which consists of a 10 c.c.\r\ncream gage and a small hydrometer (Fig. 127). The cream gage is filled\r\nto the 0 mark with milk, allowed to stand for twenty-four hours at\r\nroom temperature, and the percentage of cream then read off. The\r\npercentage of {279} fat is three-fifths that of the cream. The proteid\r\nis then approximated from a consideration of the specific gravity and\r\nthe percentage of fat. The salts and sugar very seldom vary\r\nsufficiently to affect the specific gravity, hence a high specific\r\ngravity must be due to either an increase of proteid or decrease of\r\nfat, or both, and vice versâ. With normal specific gravity the proteid\r\nis high when the fat is high, and vice versâ. The method is not\r\naccurate with cow's milk.\r\n\r\nFor more accurate work the following methods, applicable to either\r\nhuman or cow's milk, are simple and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Tube for milk analysis.]\r\n\r\nFat.--_Leffmann-Beam Method_.--This is essentially the widely used\r\nBabcock method, modified for the small quantities of milk obtainable\r\nfrom the human mammary gland. The apparatus consists of a special tube\r\nwhich fits the aluminum shield of the medical centrifuge (Fig. 128)\r\nand a 5 c.c. pipet. Owing to its narrow stem, the tube is difficult to\r\nfill and to clean. Exactly 5 c.c. of the milk are introduced into the\r\ntube by means of the pipet, and 1 c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid and amyl-alcohol is added and well\r\nmixed. The tube is filled to the 0 mark with concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid, adding a few drops at a time and agitating constantly. This is\r\nrevolved in the centrifuge at 1000 revolutions a minute for three\r\nminutes, or until the fat has separated. The percentage is then read\r\noff upon the stem, each small division representing 0.2 per cent. of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n{280} Proteids.--_T. R. Boggs' Modification of the Esbach\r\nMethod_.--This is applied as for urinary albumin (p. 74), substituting\r\nBoggs' reagent for Esbach's. The reagent is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Phosphotungstic acid               25 gm.\r\n      Distilled water                   125 c.c.\r\n\r\n  (2) Concentrated hydrochloric acid     25 c.c.\r\n      Distilled water                   100 c.c.\r\n\r\nWhen the phosphotungstic acid is completely dissolved, mix the two\r\nsolutions. This reagent is quite stable if kept in a dark glass\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nBefore examination, the milk should be diluted according to the\r\nprobable amount of proteid, and allowance made in the subsequent\r\nreading. For human milk the optimum dilution is 1:10; for cow's milk,\r\n1:20. Dilution must be accurate.\r\n\r\nLactose.--The proteid should first be removed by acidifying with\r\nacetic acid, boiling, and filtering. Purdy's method may then be used\r\nas for glucose in the urine (p. 79); but it must be borne in mind that\r\nlactose reduces copper more slowly than glucose, and longer heating\r\nis, therefore, required; and that 35 c.c. of Purdy's solution is\r\nequivalent to 0.0268 gm. lactose (as compared with 0.02 gm. glucose).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is frequently desirable to detect formalin, which is the most\r\ncommon preservative added to cow's milk. Add a few drops of dilute\r\nphenol solution to a few cubic centimeters of the milk, and run the\r\nmixture gently upon the surface of some strong sulphuric acid in a\r\ntest-tube. If formaldehyd be present, a bright-red ring will appear\r\n{281} at the line of contact of the fluids. This is not a specific\r\ntest for formaldehyd, but nothing else likely to be added to the milk\r\nwill give it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYPHILITIC MATERIAL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Spirochæte pallida: _a_ and _b_, Typical\r\npallida; _c_ and _d_, atypical curves in pallida; _e_, thick pallida,\r\napparently splitting into three; _f_, two pallida partly so closely\r\ncoiled as to resemble thick portion of _e_ (X1800) (Goldhorn).]\r\n\r\nIn 1905 Schaudinn and Hoffmann described the occurrence of a very\r\nslender, spiral micro-organism in the lesions of syphilis. This they\r\nnamed _Spirochæte pallida_, because of its low refractive power and\r\nthe difficulty with which it takes up staining reagents. Its etiologic\r\n{282} relation to syphilis is now almost universally admitted. It is\r\nnot found in tertiary lesions.\r\n\r\n_Spirochæte pallida_ is an extremely slender, spiral, motile thread,\r\nwith pointed ends. It varies considerably in length, the average being\r\nabout 7 µ, or the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle; and it exhibits\r\nthree to twelve, sometimes more, spiral curves, which are sharp and\r\nregular and resemble the curves of a corkscrew (Fig. 129). It is so\r\ndelicate that it is difficult to see even in well-stained\r\npreparations; a high magnification and careful focusing are,\r\ntherefore, required. Upon ulcerated surfaces it is often mingled with\r\nother spiral micro-organisms, which adds to the difficulty of its\r\ndetection. The most notable of these is _Spirochæte refringens_, which\r\nis distinguished by being coarser and having fewer curves of wider and\r\nless sharp contour (Fig. 130).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Spirochæte refringens (X1800) (Goldhorn).]\r\n\r\n_Spirochæte pallida_ is most easily demonstrated in chancres and\r\nmucous patches, although the skin lesions--papules, pustules,\r\nroseolous areas--often contain large numbers. Tissue-juice from the\r\ndeeper portions of the lesions is the most favorable material for\r\nexamination, because the organisms are commonly more abundant than\r\nupon ulcerated surfaces and are rarely accompanied by other\r\nmicro-organisms. After cleansing the surface a superficial incision\r\nwith a scalpel or sharp needle is made at the edge of a lesion, or the\r\nsurface is gently scraped away with a curet, and a drop of blood and\r\nserum is expressed. The less blood the better, because the {283}\r\ncorpuscles may hide the spirochæte. Very thin cover-glass smears are\r\nthen made.\r\n\r\nGoldhorn's stain gives very good results. It can be purchased ready\r\nprepared from E. Leitz, New York. The unfixed smear is covered with\r\nthe stain for four or five seconds. The excess of stain is poured off,\r\nand the preparation introduced _slowly, with the film side down_, into\r\ndistilled water. It is held in this position for four or five seconds,\r\nand is then washed by shaking about in the water. By this method the\r\n_Spirochæte pallida_ appears of a violet color, which can be changed\r\nto bluish black by flooding with Gram's iodin solution for fifteen or\r\ntwenty seconds. The preparation is then washed, dried, and mounted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN\r\n\r\nAbsence of spermatozoa is a more common cause of sterility than is\r\ngenerally recognized. In some cases they are present, but lose their\r\nmotility immediately after ejaculation.\r\n\r\nSemen must be kept warm until examined. When it must be transported\r\nany considerable distance, the method suggested by Boston is\r\nconvenient. The fresh semen is placed in a small bottle to the neck of\r\nwhich a string is attached. This is then suspended from a button on\r\nthe trousers so that the bottle rests against the skin of the inguinal\r\nregion. It may be carried in this way for hours. When ready to\r\nexamine, place a small quantity upon a warmed slide and apply a cover.\r\nThe spermatozoa are readily seen with a one-sixth objective (Fig. 53).\r\nNormally, they are abundant and in active motion.\r\n\r\nDetection of semen in stains upon clothing, etc., is {284} often\r\nimportant. The finding of spermatozoa, after soaking the stain for an\r\nhour in normal salt solution or dilute alcohol and teasing in the same\r\nfluid, is absolute proof that the stain in question is semen, although\r\nit is not possible to distinguish human semen from that of the lower\r\nanimals in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Seminal crystals (medium size) (X750) from a\r\nstain on clothing. A single thread one-eighth inch long was used in\r\nthe test, the stain being three years and four months old (Peterson\r\nand Haines).]\r\n\r\nFlorence's Reaction.--The suspected material is softened with water,\r\nplaced upon a slide with a few drops of the reagent, and examined at\r\nonce with a medium power of the microscope. If the material be semen,\r\nthere will be found dark-brown crystals (Fig. 131) in the form of\r\nrhombic platelets resembling hemin crystals, or of needles often\r\ngrouped in clusters. These crystals can {285} also be obtained from\r\ncrushed insects, watery extracts of various internal organs, and\r\ncertain other substances, so that they are not absolute proof of the\r\npresence of semen. Negative results, upon the other hand, are\r\nconclusive, even when the semen is many years old.\r\n\r\nThe reagent consists of iodin, 2.54 gm.; potassium iodid, 1.65 gm.;\r\nand distilled water, 30 c.c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{286}\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI.
