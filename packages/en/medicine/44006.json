CHARLES J. CARRICO\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Charles J. Carrico was taken at 9:30 a.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Charles J. Carrico is\r\npresent in response to a letter request for him to appear so that\r\nhis deposition may be taken in connection with the proceedings of\r\nthe President's Commission on the Investigation of the Assassination\r\nof President Kennedy in connection with the inquiry into all phases\r\nof that assassination, including medical care rendered at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico has been asked to testify relating to the treatment which\r\nhe rendered the President at Parkland Hospital. With that preliminary\r\nstatement of purpose, Dr. Carrico, would you please stand up and raise\r\nyour right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Charles James Carrico.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I attended grade school and high school in Denton, Tex.;\r\nreceived a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from North Texas State\r\nCollege in 1957, and an M.D. from Southwestern Medical School in 1961,\r\nand served an internship at Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1961 to\r\n1962, and a year of Fellowship in Surgery at Southwestern, followed by\r\nmy residency here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you working toward any specialty training, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I am engaged in a general surgery residency which will\r\nqualify me for my boards in general surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what were your duties on November 22, 1963, at\r\nParkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. At that time I was assigned to the elective surgery\r\nservice and was in the emergency room seeing some patients for\r\nevaluation for admission to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what were you doing specifically around 12 o'clock\r\nnoon?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Approximately 12 noon or shortly thereafter I was in the\r\nclinic and was called to come into the emergency room to see these\r\npeople and evaluate them for admission and treatment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you notified that there was an emergency case on the\r\nway to the hospital at approximately 12:30?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In which President Kennedy was involved?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO At that time I was in the emergency room seeing these\r\npatients and the call was received that the President had been shot and\r\nwas on his way to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best recollection as to what time it was when\r\nyou received that call?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. This was probably shortly after 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long after that call was received did the\r\nPresident's party actually arrive at Parkland?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. An estimation would be 2 minutes or less.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Describe what occurred upon the arrival of the President's\r\nparty at Parkland, please.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. We were in the emergency room preparing equipment in\r\nresponse to the call we had received when the nurse said over the\r\nintercom that they were here. Governor Connally was rolled in first and\r\nwas taken to one of the trauma rooms.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what identification was given to the trauma room to\r\nwhich Governor Connally was taken?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Trauma room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present at the time that Governor Connally came\r\ninto the emergency area?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As I recall, Dr. Richard Dulany, myself, several of the\r\nnurses, Miss Bowron is the only one I can definitely remember. Don\r\nCurtis, oral surgery resident, and I believe Martin White, the intern,\r\nwas there. These are the only people I remember being present at that\r\ntime. We had already sent out a call for Dr. Baxter and Dr. Perry and\r\nthe rest of the staff.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Dulany take any part in the treatment of President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, no, sir; he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Martin White take any part in the treatment of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I believe he was in there and did the--he helped Dr.\r\nCurtis with the cutdown, the initial cutdown.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Dr. Dulany do?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Dr. Dulany and I initially went to see the Governor, as\r\nI said, and he stayed with the Governor while I went to attend to the\r\nPresident, care for the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was the first doctor to reach President Kennedy on his\r\narrival at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who else was with President Kennedy on his arrival, as\r\nbest you can recollect it?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Mrs. Kennedy was there, and there were some men in the\r\nroom, who I assumed were Secret Service men; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any nurses who were present, in addition\r\nto Miss Bowron?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, I don't recall any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's condition upon\r\nhis arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. He was lying on a carriage, his respirations were slow,\r\nspasmodic, described as agonal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by \"agonal\" if I may interrupt you for\r\njust a moment there, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. These are respirations seen in one who has lost the normal\r\ncoordinated central control of respiration. These are spasmodic and\r\nusually reflect a terminal patient.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you continue to describe your observations of the\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. His--the President's color--I don't believe I said--he\r\nwas an ashen, bluish, grey, cyanotic, he was making no spontaneous\r\nmovements, I mean, no voluntary movements at all. We opened his shirt\r\nand coat and tie and observed a small wound in the anterior lower third\r\nof the neck, listened very briefly, heard a few cardiac beats, felt\r\nthe President's back, and detected no large or sucking chest wounds,\r\nand then proceeded to the examination of his head. The large skull and\r\nscalp wound had been previously observed and was inspected a little\r\nmore closely. There seemed to be a 4-5 cm. area of avulsion of the\r\nscalp and the skull was fragmented and bleeding cerebral and cerebellar\r\ntissue. The pupils were inspected and seemed to be bilaterally dilated\r\nand fixed. No pulse was present, and at that time, because of the\r\ninadequate respirations and the apparent airway injury, a cuffed\r\nendotracheal tube was introduced, employing a larynzo scope. Through\r\nthe larynzo scope there seemed to be some hematoma around the larynx\r\nand immediately below the larynx was seen the ragged tracheal injury.\r\nThe endotracheal tube was inserted past this injury, the cuff inflated,\r\nand the tube was connected to a respirator to assist the inadequate\r\nrespiration. At about this point the nurse reported that no blood\r\npressure was obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Carrico, with respect to this small wound in the\r\nanterior third of the neck which you have just described, could you be\r\nany more specific in defining the characteristics of that wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. This was probably a 4-7 mm. wound, almost in the midline,\r\nmaybe a little to the right of the midline, and below the thyroid\r\ncartilage. It was, as I recall, rather round and there were no jagged\r\nedges or stellate lacerations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You said you felt the President's back?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe in more detail just what the feeling of\r\nthe back involved at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Without taking the time to roll him over and look or to\r\nwash off the blood and debris, and while his coat and shirt were still\r\non his arms--I just placed my hands at about his beltline or a little\r\nabove and by slowly moving my hands upward detected that there was no\r\nlarge violation of the pleural cavity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you not take the time to turn him over?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more\r\nthorough inspection would have involved several minutes--well,\r\nseveral--considerable time which at this juncture was not available. A\r\nthorough inspection would have involved washing and cleansing the back,\r\nand this is not practical in treating an acutely injured patient. You\r\nhave to determine which things, which are immediately life threatening\r\nand cope with them, before attempting to evaluate the full extent of\r\nthe injuries.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President's back?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir. Before--well, in trying to treat an acutely\r\ninjured patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation\r\nand you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was\r\naccomplished the President's cardiac activity had ceased and closed\r\ncardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible to inspect his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any effort made to inspect the President's back after\r\nhe had expired?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his\r\nback?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You had begun to describe some of the action taken in\r\norder to endeavor to revive the President. Will you continue with that\r\ndescription, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I believe we were to where the endotracheal tube had been\r\ninserted. After this, the President--his respirations were assisted\r\nby the Bennett machine. We again listened to his chest to attempt to\r\nevaluate the respirations. Breath sounds were diminished, especially\r\non the right, despite the fact that the endotracheal tube was in place\r\nand the cuff inflated, there continued to be some leakage around\r\nthe tracheal wound. For this reason Dr. Perry elected to perform a\r\ntracheotomy, and instructed some of the other physicians in the room\r\nto insert chest tubes, thoracotomy tubes. At the beginning of the\r\nresuscitation attempt intravenous infusions had been started using\r\npolyethylene catheters by venesection, lactated renger solution, and\r\nuncross-matched type O Rh negative bloods were administered and 300\r\nmg. of hydrocortisone were administered. Shortly after the completion\r\nof the tracheotomy, Dr. Bashour arrived and had connected the cardiac\r\nmonitor. Although I never saw evidence of cardiac activity, electrical\r\ncardiac activity, Dr. Clark stated that there was a perceptible\r\nelectrical beat which shortly thereafter disappeared, and closed\r\ncardiac massage was instituted. The cardiac massage was successful in\r\nmaintaining carotid and radial pulses, but the patient's state rapidly\r\ndeteriorated and at approximately 1 o'clock he was pronounced dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, in your opinion, was the cause of death?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. A head injury.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all the treatment which was given\r\nto the President as best you recollect it?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As I recall; yes, sir; that's all--I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion or opportunity to examine the\r\nPresident's clothing?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. We did not do that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was no examination of clothing made, Dr. Carrico?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Again, this was a matter of time. The clothes were removed\r\nby the nurses, as is the usual practice, and the full attention was\r\ndevoted to trying to resuscitate the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the examination of the President's back which you\r\ndescribed that you performed, did you note any bleeding from the back?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. There was considerable blood on the cart and on his back.\r\nI could not tell if this came from his back or had fallen down from the\r\nhead injury. There was also some cerebral tissue there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did your examination by feeling disclose with respect\r\nto whether he had any back wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I did not feel any. Now, this certainly wouldn't detect\r\na small bullet entrance. All this examination is designed to do is\r\nto establish the fact that there is no gross injury to the chest\r\nposteriorly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that a routine type of examination, to ascertain\r\nwhether there is a gross injury to the chest posteriorly?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's clothing with\r\nrespect to the presence of a back brace, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. There was, on removing the President's shirt and coat, we\r\nnoted he was wearing a standard back support.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe that back support, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As I recall, it was white cotton or some fibrous support,\r\nwith staves, bones and if I remember buckled in the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How wide was it?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. How wide?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I don't know; I didn't examine below--you see--as I\r\nrecall, it came about to his umbilicus--navel area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any Ace bandage applied to the President's hips\r\nthat you observed?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No; I didn't remove his pants.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe that area of his\r\nbody when his pants were removed?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I had the opportunity, but I didn't look.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors were involved in the treatment of President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Well, of course, Dr. Perry, Dr. Clark, Dr. Baxter, Dr.\r\nMcClelland, Dr. Peters was in the room, Dr. Bashour, Dr. Ronald Jones,\r\nDr. Curtis, I believe, Dr. White was there--initially, at least, I\r\ndon't recall right offhand anyone else. There were other doctors in\r\nthere, I just can't specifically remember--there were 10 or 15 people\r\nin the room before it was over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have an opinion, Dr. Carrico, as to the cause of\r\nthe punctate wound in the President's throat?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No; I really don't--just on the basis of what I know. We\r\ndidn't make an attempt, as you know, to ascertain the track of the\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I can't hear you.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As you know, we didn't try to ascertain the track of the\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And why did you not make an effort to determine the track\r\nof the bullets?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Again, in trying to resuscitate the President, the time to\r\ndo this was not available. The examination conducted was one to try to\r\nestablish what life threatening situations were present and to correct\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any discussion among the doctors who attended\r\nPresident Kennedy as to the cause of the neck wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes; after that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what conversations were there?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As I recall, Dr. Perry and I talked and tried after--later\r\nin the afternoon to determine what exactly had happened, and we were\r\nnot aware of the missile wound to the back, and postulated that this\r\nwas either a tangential wound from a fragment, possibly another\r\nentrance wound. It could have been an exit wound, but we knew of no\r\nother entrance wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the wound in the neck consistent with being either an\r\nentry or exit wound, in your opinion?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or, did it look to be more one than the other?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No; it could have been either, depending on the size of\r\nthe missile, the velocity of the missile, the tissues that it struck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Carrico, assume these facts, if you will--first, that\r\nPresident Kennedy was struck by a 6.5-mm. missile which entered the\r\nupper-right posterior thorax, just above the scapula, being 14 cm. from\r\nthe tip of the right acromion, a-c-r-o-m-i-o-n (spelling) process,\r\nand 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process, and that the\r\nmissile traveled between two strap muscles, proceeded through the\r\nfascia channel without violating the pleural cavity, striking the side\r\nof the trachea and exiting in the lower third of the anterior throat.\r\nUnder the circumstances which I have just described to you, would\r\nthe wound which you observed on the President's throat be consistent\r\nwith the damage which a 6.5-mm. missile, traveling at the rate of\r\napproximately 2,000 feet per second, that being muzzle velocity, with\r\nthe President being 160 to 250 feet away from the rifle, would that\r\nwound be consistent with that type of a weapon at that distance, with\r\nthe missile taking the path I have just described to you?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I certainly think it could.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what would your thinking be as to why it could produce\r\nthat result?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I think a missile of this size, traveling in such a\r\ndirection that it had very little deformity, struck nothing which would\r\ncause it to begin tumbling, and was slowed very little by passing\r\nthrough this relatively easy traversed planes, would not expend a great\r\ndeal of energy on exit and would very likely not tumble, thus producing\r\na small, round, even wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What has been your experience, if any, with gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. In working in the emergency room at Parkland, we have seen\r\na fairly good number of gunshot wounds, and with .22 and .25 caliber\r\nweapons of somewhat, possibly somewhat lower velocity but at closer\r\nrange, we have seen entrance and exit wounds of almost the same size,\r\nespecially the same size, when passing through superficial structures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what superficial structures did those missiles pass\r\nthrough to which you have just referred?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. The ones I was referring to in particular were through the\r\nmuscles of the leg superficially.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how many missile wounds, bullet wounds, have\r\nyou had an opportunity to observe in your practice, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I would guess 150 or 200.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe as precisely for me as possible the\r\nnature of the head wound which you observed on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. The wound that I saw was a large gaping wound, located\r\nin the right occipitoparietal area. I would estimate to be about 5 to\r\n7 cm. in size, more or less circular, with avulsions of the calvarium\r\nand scalp tissue. As I stated before, I believe there was shredded\r\nmacerated cerebral and cerebellar tissues both in the wounds and on the\r\nfragments of the skull attached to the dura.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any other opening in the head besides the\r\none you have just described?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Specifically, did you notice a bullet wound below the\r\nlarge gaping hole which you described?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your opinion, Doctor, if you have one, as to how\r\nmany bullets were involved in the injuries inflicted on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. As far as I could tell, I would guess that there were two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Prior to today, have you ever been interviewed by any\r\nrepresentative of the Federal Government?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes, sir; the Secret Service talked to us shortly after\r\nthe President's death.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall who talked to you on that occasion?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No; I don't recall his name.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the content of that interview?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. We spoke to him in Dr. Shires' office in the medical\r\nschool concerning the President's death, mostly my part was just a\r\nstatement that the written statement that I had submitted was true.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now call your attention, Doctor, to a document\r\nheretofore identified as Commission Exhibit No. 392, to a 2-page\r\nsummary which purports to bear your signature, and dated November 22,\r\n1963, 1626 hours, and ask you first of all if that is a photostatic\r\ncopy of a report which you submitted?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, is that your signature at the end?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts set forth in there true and correct?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. They are.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to this notation of a ragged wound of the\r\ntrachea, which is contained in your report, could you describe that in\r\nmore specific detail?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. In inserting the endotracheal tube, a larynzo scope was\r\ninserted and it was noted that there was some discoloration at the\r\nlateral edge of the larynx and there appeared to be some swelling and\r\nhematoma and in looking through the chords which were partially open, a\r\nragged tissue and some blood was seen within the trachea itself. This\r\nwas the extent of what I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that specific portion of the wound give any\r\nindication as to direction of the bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No; it wouldn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any characteristic within the neck area to give\r\nany indication of the direction of the bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the Secret Service man whom you just described ask you\r\nany questions beyond whether the contents of your report were true?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I can't recall any specific questions. He did ask some\r\nothers and they did concern the wounds, and what we felt the wounds\r\nwere from, the direction, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what response did you make to those inquiries?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Essentially the same as I have here. I said I don't\r\nremember specifically.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any other representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Not in connection with this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, have you talked to someone in connection with\r\nsomething else?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Just some Government employment--Civil Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But the only time you talked to anyone about your\r\ntreatment of President Kennedy and your observations relating to that\r\ntreatment was on this one occasion with the Secret service?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes; except I just recalled since that time, another\r\nSecret Service Agent--I did speak to him briefly. He asked me if I had\r\nany other information and I said \"no\".\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the total contents of that conversation?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Prior to the time we went on the record here before you\r\nwere sworn in, did you and I have a brief conversation about the\r\npurpose of this disposition, and the general nature of the questions\r\nwhich I would ask you?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the information which you gave me at that time the\r\nsame as that to which you have testified here on the record?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever changed any of your opinions regarding your\r\ntreatment and observations of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Not as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By the way, Dr. Carrico, how old are you at the present\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any bullet found in the President's body.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Not by us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any other notes or written record of any sort\r\nconcerning your treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Not concerning the treatment. I have a note I wrote to\r\nmy children for them to read some day, but it doesn't concern the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What does that concern?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. It just concerns the day and how I felt about it and why\r\nit happened--maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Personal observations on your part?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate in any of the press conferences?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of\r\nassistance in any way to the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. No, sir; I don't believe I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Carrico, have I made available to you a letter\r\nrequesting your appearance on Monday, March 30, before the Commission,\r\nand do you acknowledge receipt of that?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would it be possible for you to attend and testify at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. I certainly can.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Carrico.\r\n\r\nDr. CARRICO. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. MALCOLM OLIVER PERRY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Malcolm Oliver Perry was taken at 3:25 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Malcolm O. Perry is present\r\nin response to a letter request that he appear here to have his\r\ndeposition taken in connection with the proceedings of the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which is now\r\ninquiring into all facets of the shooting, including the medical\r\nattention received by President Kennedy at Parkland Hospital, in which\r\nDr. Perry participated.\r\n\r\nWith that preliminary statement of purpose, would you please stand up,\r\nDr. Perry, and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Would you state your full name for the record,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Malcolm Oliver Perry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Physician and surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how old are you?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Thirty-four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Starting with high school?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That will be fine.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I attended high school at Allen High School and at Plano\r\nHigh School, graduating from the latter in 1947. I entered the\r\nUniversity of Texas from whence I duly graduated with a degree of\r\nBachelor of Arts in 1951. I went to Southwestern Medical School of the\r\nUniversity of Texas for the subsequent 4 years, graduating in 1955 with\r\na degree of Doctor of Medicine. I interned at Letterman's Army Hospital\r\nin San Francisco, and returned to a residency in surgery at Parkland\r\nHospital in July 1958. I finished that residency in June 1962, and then\r\nreturned to San Francisco and spent 1 year as additional specialization\r\nin vascular surgery. I then returned in September 1963, to Southwestern\r\nMedical School of the University of Texas as an assistant professor of\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your duties on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, as is accustomed, I was at that time on two services,\r\nboth a general surgery service and a vascular surgery service as a\r\nconsultant and attending surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, what were you doing specifically shortly after\r\nnoontime on November 22?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, at the time of the incident in question, I was having\r\nlunch in the main dining room with the chief resident, Dr. Ronald\r\nJones, in preparation for the usual Friday rounds at 1 o'clock with the\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what occurred during the course of that luncheon?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Dr. Jones, as I say, and I were having lunch when an\r\nemergency call came over the speaker system for Dr. Tom Shires, who is\r\nthe chief of surgery. I knew that Dr. Shires was in Galveston giving a\r\npaper and was not in the hospital, so Dr. Jones picked up the page to\r\nsee if he or I could be of assistance. We were informed by the hospital\r\noperator that Mr. Kennedy had been shot and was being brought to\r\nParkland Hospital for care.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action did you take as a result of learning those\r\nfactors?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The dining room was located one floor up from the emergency\r\nroom, so Dr. Jones and I went immediately to the emergency room to\r\nrender what assistance we could.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our arrival in the emergency room, the President was\r\nalready there, and as I entered trauma room No. 1, Dr. James Carrico,\r\nthe surgical resident on duty, had just placed an endotracheal tube to\r\nassist respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present in addition to Dr. Carrico, if you recall,\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I cannot with accuracy relate all the people that were\r\nthere--Dr. Carrico, I saw and spoke to briefly. There were several\r\nother people in the room. There were several nurses there--I don't know\r\nat this time who they were. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room and there\r\nwas a gentleman with her and there were several other gentlemen both\r\nin the door and right outside the door to the room. Some of them, I\r\nassume, part of the legal force.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other doctors in the room at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir; I did not. There was somebody else in the room,\r\nbut I don't know who it was. I remember only Dr. Carrico--I had the\r\nimpression that one of the interns was in the room, but this may be an\r\nimpression gathered after the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's condition at\r\nthe time you first saw him?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. He was lying supine on the emergency cart directly in\r\nthe center of the room under the overhead lamp. His shirt had, been\r\nremoved, and intravenous infusion was being begun in the right leg, I\r\nbelieve. Dr. Carrico was at the head of the table attaching the oxygen\r\napparatus to assist in respiration.\r\n\r\nI noted there was a large wound of the right posterior parietal area\r\nin the head exposing lacerated brain. There was blood and brain tissue\r\non the cart. The President's eyes were deviated and dilated and he was\r\nunresponsive. There was a small wound in the lower anterior third in\r\nthe midline of the neck, from which blood was exuding very slowly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe that wound as precisely as you can,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The wound was roughly spherical to oval in shape, not a\r\npunched-out wound, actually, nor was it particularly ragged. It was\r\nrather clean cut, but the blood obscured any detail about the edges of\r\nthe wound exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition of the edges of the wound, if you\r\ncan recollect?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I couldn't state with certainty, due to the fact that they\r\nwere covered by blood and I did not make a minute examination. I\r\ndetermined only the fact that there was a wound there, roughly 5 mm. in\r\nsize or so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described it as precisely as you can; that\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else, if anything, did you observe as to the\r\ncondition of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Spasmodic respiratory efforts were obvious, but I did not\r\ndetect a pulse nor a heart beat on a very rapid examination. It was\r\napparent that respirations were ineffective, even with the use of the\r\nendotracheal tube and oxygen. At that point I asked Dr. Carrico if this\r\nwas a wound in his neck or had he begun the tracheotomy, and he said it\r\nwas a wound and I, at that point, asked someone to get me a tracheotomy\r\ntray, and put on some gloves and initiated the procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you described everything that you can recollect\r\nabout your observations of the President before you started to work on\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There was no evidence to that cursory examination of any\r\nother wound. I did not move the President. I did not turn him over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you not turn him over?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. At that point it was necessary to attend to the emergent\r\nprocedure and a satisfactory effective airway is uppermost in such a\r\ncondition. If you are unable to obtain an effective airway, then the\r\nother procedures are to be of no avail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, on the subject of turning him over, did you ever\r\nturn him over?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why didn't you turn him over after you had taken the\r\ninitial action on him?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. After the tracheotomy tube was in place and we were\r\nbreathing for him, Dr. Clark and I had begun external cardiac massage,\r\nsince we had been unable to detect a heart beat, blood pressure, or\r\npulse. I continued with the cardiac massage while Dr. Clark examined\r\nthe head wound, and he and Dr. Jenkins conferred in regard to the\r\nelectrocardiogram. It was determined that none of the resuscitative\r\nmeasures were effective and the procedures were then abandoned.\r\n\r\nI had no further business in the room at that point, and I left the\r\nroom momentarily. I returned within a minute or so, because I had left\r\nmy coat where I dropped it and asked one of the nurses to hand me my\r\ncoat, and I left the room and went to the operating suite from there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did that conclude your participation in the treatment\r\nof President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. It did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the time you arrived in\r\nthe Emergency Room?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I really don't know the time. It was about 12:30 or so when\r\nI was eating and the call must have come thereabouts, and I didn't look\r\nat my watch at that time, nor did I have an opportunity to look at it\r\nagain until after I had left the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the time which elapsed\r\nfrom the point that you knew it was 12:30, until the time you arrived\r\nat the emergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. It must have been within the next few minutes. I really\r\ndon't know. As I say, we were sitting there eating and I had no\r\noccasion to look at my watch again. At that time I was much too busy to\r\nconsult it further.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the time you left the\r\nemergency room after finishing your treatment and work on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. After I left trauma room No. 1, I went outside and washed\r\nmy hands and then I retrieved my coat and I sat down for a few minutes\r\nin a chair there in the emergency room for probably 10 or 15 minutes,\r\nI suppose, and then I went from there to the operating suite to assist\r\nin the care of the Governor, so I must have left the emergency room\r\nprobably somewhere around 1:15 or 1:20, I would gather.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time was the President pronounced to\r\nbe dead?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I don't know this for a fact, other than what was related\r\nto me by Dr. Clark, and he tells me that this was at 1 o'clock. Once\r\nagain, I did not verify the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you described all of the efforts which were made to\r\nrevive the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There were other procedures done that I did not do during\r\nthis period. I did not describe in detail the performance of the\r\ntracheotomy. It seems that that is really not necessary at this time,\r\nunless you want it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe it in detail, the procedures which were\r\nfollowed in the efforts to save the President's life?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. All right. Well, to regress, then, at the time I began the\r\ntracheotomy, I made an incision right through the wound which was\r\npresent in the neck in order to gain complete control of any injury in\r\nthe underlying trachea.\r\n\r\nI made a transverse incision right through this wound and carried it\r\ndown to the superficial fascia, to expose the strap muscles overlying\r\nthe thyroid and the trachea. There was an injury to the right lateral\r\naspect of the trachea at the level of the external wound. The trachea\r\nwas deviated slightly to the left and it was necessary to divide the\r\nstrap muscles on the left side in order to gain access to the trachea.\r\nAt this point, I recall, Dr. Jones right on my left was placing a\r\ncatheter into a vein in the left arm because he handed me a necessary\r\ninstrument which I needed in the performance of the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe wound in the trachea was then enlarged to admit a cuffed\r\ntracheotomy tube to support respiration. I noted that there was free\r\nair and blood in the superior right mediastinum.\r\n\r\nAlthough I saw no injury to the lung or to the pleural space, the\r\npresence of this free blood and air in this area could be indicative\r\nof a wound of the right hemithorax, and I asked that someone put a\r\nright chest tube in for seal drainage. At the time I did not know who\r\ndid this, but I have been informed that Dr. Baxter and Dr. Paul Peters\r\ninserted the chest tube and connected it to underwater drainage.\r\n\r\nBlood transfusions and fluid transfusions were being given at this\r\ntime, and through the previous venesections that had been done by Dr.\r\nJones and Dr. Carrico.\r\n\r\nAlso, the President had received 300 mg. of Solucortef in order to\r\nsupport his adrenal glands, since it was common medical knowledge that\r\nhe suffered from adrenal insufficiency.\r\n\r\nOf course, oxygen and pressure breathing were being effected under\r\nthe guidance of Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke, who were handling the\r\nanesthesia machine at the head of the table.\r\n\r\nDr. Bashour and Dr. Seldin, in addition to Dr. Clark, had arrived\r\nand also assisted in monitoring cardiac actions, as indicated by the\r\noscilloscope and the cardiotachioscope.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the operative procedures\r\nperformed on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes, all that I am familiar with.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any doctors who participated other than those\r\nwhom you have already identified in the course of your description?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes, sir; immediately on arriving there, and as I say, Dr.\r\nJones and I, and I saw Dr. Carrico, and I have the impression there was\r\nanother physician there, but I don't know who it was. I asked that an\r\nemergency call be placed for Dr. Kemp Clark, chief of neurosurgery, for\r\nDr. Robert McClelland, and Dr. Charles Baxter, assistant professors of\r\nsurgery. They responded immediately. I don't know how long it took them\r\nto get there, but they were probably there within the next few minutes.\r\nMy first recollection of Dr. McClelland and Dr. Baxter being there was\r\nwhen I was doing the tracheotomy, they suddenly were there assisting\r\nme. I don't know when they came in the room, nor do I know when Dr.\r\nClark or the other gentlemen arrived, and there must have been 10 or 12\r\ndoctors all told by then.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are there any others whom you could identify?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Dr. Peters--I previously mentioned, Dr. Paul Peters,\r\nassistant professor of urology, Dr. Fouad Bashour, associate professor\r\nof medicine, and chief of cardiology, and Dr. Don Seldin, chief of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nI mentioned Dr. M. T. Jenkins, chief of anesthesia, and Dr. Giesecke,\r\nhis assistant professor of anesthesiology--that's the only people that\r\nI saw directly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could the first doctor whom you saw have been Dr. Don\r\nCurtis?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That's entirely possible--I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Dr. Dulany there?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I have initially had the impression that Dr. Dulany was in\r\nthe room when I came in there, but as I understand it, he actually was\r\njust going into the room across the hall, but he was there by the door\r\nwhen I came in, but I had the impression he was leaving that room, but\r\nI understand he was not, that actually he was going--just going in the\r\nroom across the hall with the Governor, although I initially thought\r\nDr. Dulany was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe, if anything with respect to bruising\r\nin the interior portion of the President's neck?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There was considerable hematoma in the right lateral portion\r\nof the neck and the right superior mediastinum, as I noted. As for\r\nbruising, per se, it would be difficult to describe that, since by\r\ndefinition, hematoma would be a collection of blood, and there was\r\nso much blood that the tissues were discolored. I did not attempt to\r\nascertain trajectory or path of the bullet at the time, but directed\r\nmyself to obtaining an adequate airway and carried my examination no\r\nfurther down than it was necessary to assure myself that the trachea\r\nwas controlled and that there was no large vessel injury at that level.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there sufficient facts available to you for you to\r\nreach a conclusion as to the cause of the wound on the front side of\r\nthe President's neck?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir, there was not. I could not determine whether or\r\nhow this was inflicted, per se, since it would require tracing the\r\ntrajectory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's head,\r\nspecifically?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I saw no injuries other than the one which I noted to you,\r\nwhich was a large avulsive injury of the right occipitoparietal area,\r\nbut I did not do a minute examination of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice a bullet hole below the large avulsed area?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Perry, earlier I asked you whether you turned over\r\nthe President at any time during the course of your treatment or\r\nexamination of him, and you indicated that you had not, and I then\r\nasked you why, and you proceeded to tell me of the things that you did\r\nin sequence, as being priority items to try to save his life. Why did\r\nyou not turn him over at the conclusion of those operative procedures?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, actually, I didn't have a specific reason, other than\r\nit had been determined that he had expired. There was nothing further\r\nthat I could do and it was not my particular prerogative to make a\r\nminute examination to determine any other cause. I felt that that was a\r\nlittle bit out of my domain.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any occasion to examine the President's\r\nclothing to ascertain direction of the missile?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No; I did not. The only aspect of clothing that I know\r\nabout--I happen to recall pushing up the brace which he had on in an\r\nattempt to feel a femoral pulse when I arrived, and I could not, but\r\nthe shirt had been removed by the personnel there in the emergency\r\nroom, I assume.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the description of that brace?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I couldn't give you a description. I just saw and felt the\r\nlower edge of one, and I reached to feel the left femoral pulse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see whether the President was wearing any sort of\r\nan Ace bandage on the midsection of his body when his trousers were\r\ntaken down?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There was evidence of an Ace bandage--I saw it sticking out\r\nfrom the edge on the right side, as I recall. I don't believe it was\r\non the midsection, although it may have been. I believe it was on his\r\nright leg--his right thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether it was on the left leg and thigh as\r\nwell?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, I don't. I just saw that briefly when I was reaching for\r\nthat pulse and I didn't do any examination at all of the lower trunk or\r\nlower extremities.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you personally make any examination by feeling, or in\r\nany other way, of the President's back?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate in a press conference or press\r\nconferences following the death of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when was the first of such press conferences?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I don't know the exact time, Mr. Specter. It must have been\r\nwithin the hour, I would say; I don't know exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present at that press conference by way of\r\nidentifying, if you can, the members of the news media?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I have no idea. The press conference was held in classrooms\r\n1 and 2 combined here at Parkland. The room was quite full of people.\r\nI remember noting some surprise how quickly they had put in a couple\r\nof telephones at the back. There were numerous cameras and lights,\r\nand flashbulbs, and I went there with one of the administrators, Mr.\r\nLandregan, and Dr. Kemp Clark and Mr. Hawkes, who was identified to me\r\nas being with the White House Press. I don't know--there were numerous\r\npeople of the press.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors appeared and spoke at that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Dr. Clark, myself, and Dr. Baxter was also there. He arrived\r\na little bit late. I called him just before I went down and asked\r\nhim and Dr. McClelland to come. I could not find Dr. McClelland. He\r\napparently was busy with a patient at the time. I recall Dr. Baxter\r\ncame in after the press conference had begun, but I don't believe he\r\nsaid anything. Dr. Clark and I answered the majority of the questions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, what questions were asked of you and what responses\r\ndid you give at that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, there were numerous questions asked, all the questions\r\nI cannot remember, of course. Specifically, the thing that seemed to\r\nbe of most interest at that point was actually trying to get me to\r\nspeculate as to direction of the bullets, the number of bullets, and\r\nthe exact cause of death.\r\n\r\nThe first two questions I could not answer, and my reply to them was\r\nthat I did not know, if there were one or two bullets, and I could not\r\ncategorically state about the nature of the neck wound, whether it\r\nwas an entrance or an exit wound, not having examined the President\r\nfurther--I could not comment on any other injuries.\r\n\r\nAs regards the cause of death, Dr. Clark and I concurred that massive\r\nbrain trauma with attendant severe hemorrhage was the underlying\r\ncause of death, and then there were questions asked in regard to\r\nwhat we did, and I described as I have for you, although not in such\r\ndetail--essentially the resuscitative measures that were taken at\r\nthat time; namely, the reinfusion of a balanced salt solution of\r\nblood, Solucortef, assisting of respiration with oxygen and pressure\r\napparatus, the tracheotomy, and the chest tubes and the monitoring with\r\nthe cardiotachioscope.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you express a view as to what might have happened with\r\nrespect to the number of bullets?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I was asked by several of the people of the press,\r\ninitially, if there were one or two or more bullets, and to that, Dr.\r\nClark and I both replied that we could not say. I was then asked if it\r\nwas conceivable that it could have been caused by one bullet, and I\r\nreplied in the affirmative, that I did not know, but it was conceivable.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you elaborate on how it could have been caused by one\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I was asked if this were one bullet, how would it occur, and\r\nI said, \"It is conceivable or possible that a bullet could enter and\r\nstrike the spinal column and be deviated superiorly to exit from the\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where would that point of entry have been?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The surmise was made that if the point of entry were in the\r\nneck, how would it have happened, and that is the way I would have\r\nreconstructed it. Again, this was speculation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you denominate it clearly as speculation?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or, what could have been as opposed to what your opinion\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I did. I said this was conceivable--this was possible, but\r\nagain, Dr. Clark and I emphasized again that we did not know whether\r\nthere was one or two bullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you express any view as to whether it might have been\r\none bullet or two bullets or either, or what?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I said I did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you asked any other questions at that press\r\nconference that you can recollect as being important at this time?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Someone did ask us about Mrs. Kennedy, and I recall that I\r\nmentioned that I did not speak to her, but that she was very composed\r\nand very quiet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you a part of any other press conferences?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did the next one occur?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There were several organized press conferences that occurred\r\nin the administration suite in the hospital, Mr. Specter, and I don't\r\nknow the exact times of these. There were several later that afternoon.\r\nThere were some the following day, on Saturday, also held in the\r\nadministrator's office, and then there were subsequent conferences in\r\nrelation to the other incident that occurred on Sunday with Mr. Oswald.\r\nI don't know how many there were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were all these conferences set up by the administration of\r\nthe hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. They were all conducted here. They weren't necessarily--I\r\nwouldn't say--set up by the administration. They were done here at the\r\nhospital, with one exception, of which you are aware, that I spoke with\r\nyou about the gentleman that came to me when I was out of town.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you elaborate upon what occurred on that occasion,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I had taken the course of complying with the press insofar\r\nas was possible about what I could speak that was common knowledge and\r\nwhich had already been covered at the initial press conference. I had\r\ndone that in the administrative suite or in the hospital or in the\r\nmedical school under an organized situation as opposed to doing it,\r\nsay, at home.\r\n\r\nI left town Monday following the incident on Sunday with Oswald, in\r\norder to secure a little bit of rest for myself and my family, and\r\napproximately 36 hours later, members of the press had located me and\r\nrequested an interview, which I granted, denying any photographs and\r\nthe interview consisted of essentially the same thing that I had given\r\nto the previous press conference at the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that interview conducted?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That was in McAllen, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the course of all of these press conferences did you\r\nsay anything other than that which you have already related you said\r\nduring the course of the first press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That would require a little bit of thought. I don't\r\nthink in essence I said anything different. Of course, the wording\r\ncertainly would have been different. I subsequently had a little bit\r\nmore knowledge about the initial episode attendant of course upon\r\nmy discussions with the other doctors and the writing out of our\r\nstatements, knowledge which I did not have initially, which may have\r\nmade subsequent statements perhaps more accurate as regards to time and\r\npeople, but in essence, things that I did and things that I said that I\r\ndid are essentially the same in all of these.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Perry, I now show you a group of papers heretofore\r\nidentified as Commission Exhibit No. 392, and I turn to two sheets\r\nwhich are dated November 22, 1963, which have the name \"Perry\" beside\r\nthe doctor and purport to bear your signature, and the time--1630\r\nhours, 22 November 1963, and I ask you if this is a photostatic copy of\r\nthe handwritten report which you submitted concerning the attention you\r\ngave to the President on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this your signature appearing on the second sheet?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That is my signature.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts set forth herein true and correct?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. They are, to the best of my knowledge, correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Perry, have contents of the autopsy report conducted\r\nat Bethesda Naval Hospital been made available to you?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. They have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the findings in the autopsy report consistent with\r\nyour observations and conclusions concerning the source and nature of\r\nthe President's wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; they are. I think there are no discrepancies at all. I\r\ndid not have that information initially, and as a result was somewhat\r\nconfused about the nature of the wounds, as I noted--I could not tell\r\nwhether there was one or two bullets, or from whence they came, but the\r\nfindings of the autopsy report are quite compatible with those findings\r\nwhich I noted at the time that I saw the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you noted in the autopsy report the reference to\r\nthe presence of a wound on the upper right posterior thorax just above\r\nthe upper border of the scapula, being 7 by 4 mm. in oval dimension and\r\nbeing located 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14\r\ncm. below the tip of the right mastoid process?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; I saw that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming that was a point of entry of a missile, which\r\nparenthetically was the opinion of the three autopsy surgeons, and\r\nassuming still further that the missile which struck the President at\r\nthat spot was a 6.5-mm. jacketed bullet shot from a rifle at a distance\r\nof 166 to 250 feet, having a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000\r\nfeet per second, and that upon entering the President's body, the\r\nbullet traveled between two strap muscles, through a fascia channel,\r\nwithout violating the pleural cavity, striking the trachea, causing\r\nthe damage which you testified about being on the interior of the\r\nPresident's throat, and exited from the President's throat in the\r\nwound which you have described in the midline of his neck, would your\r\nfindings and observations as to the nature of the wound on the throat\r\nbe consistent with the set of facts I just presented to you?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. It would be entirely compatible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the basis for your conclusion that the\r\nsituation that I presented to you would be entirely compatible with\r\nyour observations and findings?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The wound in the throat, although as I noted, I did not\r\nexamine it minutely, was fairly small in nature, and an undeformed,\r\nunexpanded missile exiting at rather high speed would leave very little\r\ninjury behind, since the majority of its energy was expended after it\r\nhad left the tissues.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would the hole that you observed on the President's\r\nthroat then be consistent with such an exit wound?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. It would. There is no way to determine from my examination\r\nas to exactly how accurately I could depict an entrance wound from an\r\nexit wound, without ascertaining the entire trajectory. Such a wound\r\ncould be produced by such a missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any facts on trajectory available to you at the time\r\nof the press conferences that you described?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. They were not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In response to an earlier question which I asked you, I\r\nbelieve you testified that you did not have sufficient facts available\r\ninitially to form an opinion as to the source or direction of the cause\r\nof the wound, did you not?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That's correct, although several leading questions were\r\ndirected toward me at the various conferences.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And to those leading questions you have said here today\r\nthat you responded that a number of possibilities were present as to\r\nwhat might have happened?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That's correct. I had no way of ascertaining, as I said, the\r\ntrue trajectory. Often questions were directed as to--in such a manner\r\nas this: \"Doctor, is it possible that if he were in such and such a\r\nposition and the bullet entered here, could it have done that?\" And\r\nmy reply, \"Of course, if it were possible, yes, that is possible, but\r\nsimilarly, it did not have to be so, necessarily.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that, from the physical characteristics which you\r\nobserved in and of themselves, you could not come to any conclusive\r\nopinion?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir; I could not, although I have been quoted, I think,\r\nas saying, and I might add parenthetically, out of context, without the\r\npreceding question which had been directed, as saying that such was the\r\ncase, when actually, I only admitted that the possibility existed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in the hypothetical of the rather extended nature that\r\nI just gave you that your statement that that is consistent with what\r\nyou found, is that also predicated upon the veracity of the factors,\r\nwhich I have asked you to assume?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That is correct, sir. I have no way to authenticate either\r\nby my own knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has your recollection of the nature of the President's\r\nneck wound changed at any time from November 22 to the present time?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir. I recall describing it initially as being between 3\r\nand 5 cm. in size and roughly spherical in shape, not unlike a rather\r\nlarge puncture wound, I believe is the word I used initially.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever changed your opinion on the possible\r\nalternatives as to what could have caused the President's wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir; I have no knowledge even now of my own as to the\r\ncause of the wounds. All I can report on is what I saw, and the wound\r\nis that as I have described it. It could have been caused conceivably\r\nby any number of objects.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, that the wound that you saw on the President's neck\r\nwould be consistent with an exit wound under the factors that I\r\ndescribed to you?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or, it might be consistent with an entry wound under a\r\ndifferent set of factors?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. That's correct, sir. I, myself, have no knowledge of that. I\r\ndo not think that it is consistent, for example, with an exit wound of\r\na large expanded bullet--voluntarily I would add that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, would a jacketed 6.5-mm. bullet fit the description\r\nof a large expanded bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir; it would not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the information in the autopsy report about a\r\n6- by 15-mm. hole in the lower part of the President's skull on the\r\nright side in conjunction with the large part of the skull of the\r\nPresident which you observed to be missing, would you have an opinion\r\nas to the source of the missile which inflicted those wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Since I did not see the initial wound which you mentioned,\r\nthe smaller one, and only saw the large avulsive wound of the head and\r\nthe scalp, there is no way for me to determine from whence it came.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, if you assume the presence of the first small wound,\r\ntaking as a fact that there was such a wound, now, would that present\r\nsufficient information for you to formulate an opinion as to source or\r\ntrajectory?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, I couldn't testify as to exact source, but if the\r\nwound, the smaller wound that you noted were present, it could\r\ncertainly result in the large avulsive wound as it exited from the\r\nskull. As to the ultimate source, there would still be no way for me to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, could you tell sufficient to comment on whether it\r\ncame from the front or back of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. In the absence of other wounds of the head, the presence of\r\nthe small wound which you described, in addition to the large avulsive\r\nwound of the skull and the scalp which I observed would certainly\r\nindicate that the two were related and would indicate both an entrance\r\nand an exit wound, if there were no other wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And which would be the wound of entrance, then?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The smaller wound--the smaller wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you have occasion to talk via the telephone with\r\nDr. James J. Humes of the Bethesda Naval Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you relate the circumstances of the calls\r\nindicating first the time when they occurred.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Dr. Humes called me twice on Friday afternoon, separated by\r\nabout 30-minute intervals, as I recall. The first one, I, somehow think\r\nI recall the first one must have been around 1500 hours, but I'm not\r\nreal sure about that; I'm not positive of that at all, actually.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could it have been Saturday morning?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Saturday morning--was it? It's possible. I remember talking\r\nwith him twice. I was thinking it was shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, the record will show.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Oh, sure, it was Saturday morning--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What made you change your view of that?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. You mean Friday?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did some specific recollection occur to you which changed\r\nyour view from Friday to Saturday?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, I was trying to place where I was at that time--Friday\r\nafternoon, and at that particular time, when I paused to think about\r\nit, I was actually up in the operating suite at that time, when I\r\nthought that he called initially. I seem to remember it being Friday,\r\nfor some reason.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you when you received those calls?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I was in the Administrator's office here when he called.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did he ask you, if anything?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. He inquired about, initially, about the reasons for my doing\r\na tracheotomy, and I replied, as I have to you, during this procedure,\r\nthat there was a wound in the lower anterior third of the neck, which\r\nwas exuding blood and was indicative of a possible tracheal injury\r\nunderlying, and I did the tracheotomy through a transverse incision\r\nmade through that wound, and I described to him the right lateral\r\ninjury to the trachea and the completion of the operation.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently called back--at that time he told me, of course, that\r\nhe could not talk to me about any of it and asked that I keep it in\r\nconfidence, which I did, and he subsequently called back and inquired\r\nabout the chest tubes, and why they were placed and I replied in part\r\nas I have here. It was somewhat more detailed. After having talked to\r\nDrs. Baxter and Peters and I identified them as having placed it in\r\nthe second interspace, anteriorly, in the midclavicular line, in the\r\nright hemithorax, he asked me at that time if we had made any wounds\r\nin the back. I told him that I had not examined the back nor had I\r\nknowledge of any wounds of the back.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate the circumstances surrounding an article\r\nwhich appeared about you in the Saturday Evening Post, Dr. Perry?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. The Saturday Evening Post contacted the department of\r\nsurgery here, and talked with Dr. Tom Shires, chief of surgical\r\nservices, in regard to a possible article on the treatment of the\r\nPresident. This was declined by us, and we requested that no such\r\narticle be printed, and Dr. Shires informed me shortly thereafter\r\nabout this conversation. Subsequently, an article was printed, which\r\napparently was a copyrighted item. It first appeared in the New York\r\nHerald Tribune. It contained my picture and a picture of trauma room\r\nNo. 1, and described the incidents surrounding the treatment of the\r\nPresident. Some of that information was obtained by personal interview\r\nof myself and Dr. Shires on Saturday morning, and I assume that the\r\nrest of it was obtained from various people here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the content of that story accurate?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. There were certain inaccuracies--the overall content\r\nwas fairly consistent--there were inaccuracies in identification\r\nof participants and there were some inaccuracies in regards to\r\nconversations purported to have been held, and I do not, however, have\r\nknowledge about some of the other references made in the article, since\r\nthey were apparently based on interviews with people other than myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Perry, have you talked to any representatives of the\r\nFederal Government about this matter prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate whom you have talked to and on what\r\noccasions? As best you can recollect it.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Well, I talked to several people, and I regret that I did\r\nnot keep a record of it, and I find at this time that a lot of these\r\nthings such as Dr. Humes' call, I suppose I should have kept a little\r\nbetter record, since everything was so kaleidoscopic that I have a very\r\ndifficult time putting the proper sequence on it. I talked to several\r\npeople who identified themselves both by name and with credentials as\r\nbeing affiliated with the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions have you talked with Secret Service\r\npersonnel?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. At least three times, sir. Now, I can't give you the exact\r\ndates of these, and unfortunately the last two gentlemen, I can't even\r\nremember their names now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the first gentleman?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, his either. I was trying to think of the last two. I\r\nindicated that they both had the same last name, but at the present\r\ntime it escapes me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell them in essence?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Essentially what I have told you in regard to my impressions\r\nand my care of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has there ever been any variation in the information which\r\nyou have given the Federal investigators?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir; not in essence. There may have been a variation in\r\nwording or sequence of my presentation, but the treatment as I outlined\r\nit to you and as I outlined it to them, to the best of my knowledge,\r\nhas been essentially consistent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any other representatives of the\r\nFederal Government besides the Secret Service men?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I talked to two gentlemen initially within--who identified\r\nthemselves as being with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I do not\r\nrecall their names either.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did they ask you about?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Essentially the same questions in regard to what I might\r\nspeculate as to the origin of the missiles and their trajectory, and I\r\nreplied to them as I have to you that I could not ascertain this of my\r\nown knowledge, and described the wounds to the extent I saw them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you set forth here today the same information which\r\nyou gave to the FBI?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes, I think this is considerably in more detail, being\r\nessentially the same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now told me about all of the talks you have had\r\nwith representatives of the Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I think I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I sit down and talk about the purpose of\r\nthis deposition and the questions which I would be asking you on the\r\nrecord, before this deposition started?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you give me the same information which you\r\nprovided on the record here today?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful in any way to the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Perry, we appreciate your coming for your deposition\r\ntoday, and I have given you a letter requesting your presence in\r\nWashington on Monday morning at 9 o'clock and I would ask you, for the\r\nrecord, to acknowledge receipt of letter, if you will, please.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Yes; I have the letter here and I will be there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you, very much, sir. Let me ask you one more\r\nquestion, Dr. Perry, for the record, before we terminate this\r\ndeposition. What experience have you had, if any, with gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. I think in the course of my training here at Parkland,\r\nwhich is a city-county hospital and handles the great majority of the\r\ntrauma cases that occur in Dallas County, that I have seen a fairly\r\nconsiderable number of traumatic wounds caused by knives, automobile\r\naccidents, gunshot wounds of various types.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had any experience with gunshot wounds, in\r\naddition to that obtained here at Parkland?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. You mean, in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, I had occasion to see only one gunshot wound while I was\r\nin the service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you estimate how many gunshot wounds you have seen\r\nwhile you have been at Parkland?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Probably it would be numbered in the hundreds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had any formal training in ballistics?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. No, other than the fact that I do some hunting and amateur\r\nhand loader.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Amateur what?\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. Amateur hand loader--hand load ammunition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nDr. PERRY. All right. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. WILLIAM KEMP CLARK\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. William Kemp Clark was taken at 11:50 a.m., on\r\nMarch 21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you stand up please, Dr. Clark, and raise your right\r\nhand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy in\r\nthis deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You may be seated.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The President's Commission is investigating all facts\r\nrelated to the Assassination of President Kennedy, and you have been\r\nasked to testify in this deposition proceeding relating to the medical\r\ntreatment received by President Kennedy at Parkland Memorial Hospital\r\nand all facts incident thereto.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark, have you received a letter from the President's Commission\r\nenclosing a copy of the Executive Order establishing the Commission and\r\na copy of a Senate and House Joint Resolution about the Commission, and\r\na letter relating to the taking of testimony by the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing to proceed with this deposition today,\r\neven though 3 days have not elapsed between the time you received the\r\nletter and this morning?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. William Kemp Clark.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline in a general way your educational\r\nbackground, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes. I graduated from the University of Texas in Austin,\r\n1944. I graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch at\r\nGalveston in 1948. I interned at Indiana University Medical Center and\r\nwas a resident in surgery there from 1948 to 1950. I spent 2 years in\r\nthe Air Force and then took my residency in neurological surgery at\r\nColumbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. This was from 1953 to\r\n1956, at which time I came to the University of Texas, Southwestern\r\nMedical School, as chairman of the division of neurological surgery.\r\n\r\nWould you like the professional qualifications?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; may I have the professional qualifications in summary\r\nform, if you will, please.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I am board certified by the American Board of Neurological\r\nSurgery. I am a Fellow with the American College of Surgeons. I am a\r\nmember of the Harvey Cushing Society.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the Harvey Cushing Society, by the way?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. It is the largest society of neurological surgeons in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what do your duties consist of with respect to the\r\nSouthwestern Medical School of the University of Texas?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I am in charge of the division of neurological surgery\r\nand carry the responsibility of administering this department or\r\nthis division, to arrange the instruction of medical students in\r\nneurological surgery and to conduct research in this field.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your duties back on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Essentially these. I also, as chairman of the division, have\r\nthe responsibility as director of neurological surgery at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital which is the major teaching hospital of the medical\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you receive notification on November 22, 1963, that\r\nthe President had been wounded and was en route to this hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know at approximately what time you got that\r\nnotification?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Approximately 12:20 or 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action, if any, did you take as a result of\r\nreceiving that notification?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I went immediately to the emergency room at Parkland\r\nHospital. I was in the laboratory at Southwestern Medical School when\r\nthis word reached me by phone from the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at approximately what time did you then arrive at the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I would estimate it took a minute and a half to two minutes,\r\nso I would guess that I arrived approximately 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present, if anyone, upon your arrival,\r\nattending to the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Jenkins, that is M. T. Jenkins, I suppose I ought to\r\nsay, Dr. Ronald Jones, Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. James Carrico; arriving\r\neither with me or immediately thereafter were Dr. Robert McClelland,\r\nDr. Paul Peters, and Dr. Charles Baxter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe the President's condition to be on\r\nyour arrival there?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The President was lying on his back on the emergency cart.\r\nDr. Perry was performing a tracheotomy. There were chest tubes being\r\ninserted. Dr. Jenkins was assisting the President's respirations\r\nthrough a tube in his trachea. Dr. Jones and Dr. Carrico were\r\nadministering fluids and blood intravenously. The President was making\r\na few spasmodic respiratory efforts. I assisted in withdrawing the\r\nendotracheal tube from the throat as Dr. Perry was then ready to insert\r\nthe tracheotomy tube. I then examined the President briefly.\r\n\r\nMy findings showed his pupils were widely dilated, did not react to\r\nlight, and his eyes were deviated outward with a slight skew deviation.\r\n\r\nI then examined the wound in the back of the President's head. This was\r\na large, gaping wound in the right posterior part, with cerebral and\r\ncerebellar tissue being damaged and exposed. There was considerable\r\nblood loss evident on the carriage, the floor, and the clothing of\r\nsome of the people present. I would estimate 1,500 cc. of blood being\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAs I was examining the President's wound, I felt for a carotid pulse\r\nand felt none. Therefore, I began external cardiac massage and asked\r\nthat a cardiotachioscope be connected. Because of my position it was\r\ndifficult to administer cardiac massage. However, Dr. Jones stated that\r\nhe felt a femoral pulse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is a femoral pulse?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. A femoral artery is the main artery going to the legs, and\r\nat the junction of the leg and the trunk you can feel the arterial\r\npulsation in this artery. Because of my position, cardiac massage was\r\ntaken over by Dr. Malcolm Perry, who was more advantageously situated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the cardiotachioscope show at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. By this time the cardiotachioscope, we just call it a\r\ncardiac monitor for a better word----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's a good word.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The cardiotachioscope had been attached and Dr. Fouad\r\nBashour had arrived. There was transient electrical activity of the\r\nPresident's heart of an undefined type. Approximately, at this time the\r\nexternal cardiac massage became ineffectual and no pulsations could be\r\nfelt. At this time it was decided to pronounce the President dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time was this fixed?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Death was fixed at 1 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that a precise time or an approximate time, or in what\r\nway did you fix the time of death at 1 o'clock?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. This was an approximation as it is, first, extremely\r\ndifficult to state precisely when death occurs. Secondly, no one was\r\nmonitoring the clock, so an approximation of 1 o'clock was chosen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was it who actually fixed the time of death?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have any part in the filling out of the death\r\ncertificate?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do with respect to that?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I filled out the death certificate at the request of Dr.\r\nGeorge Burkley, the President's physician at the White House, signed\r\nthe death certificate as a registered physician in the State of Texas,\r\nand gave this to him to accompany the body to Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you advise anyone else in the Presidential party of\r\nthe death of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; I told Mrs. Kennedy, the President's wife, of his death.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, did she respond to you?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. She told me that she knew it and thanked me for our efforts.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any bullets or parts of bullets found in the\r\nPresident's body?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Not by me, nor did I see any such missiles recovered at\r\nParkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you a part of any press conference which followed on\r\nthe day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who made the arrangements for the press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Mr. Malcolm Kilduff, the Presidential press secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time did the press conference occur?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Approximately 2:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was it held?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. It was held in room 101-102, Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What mechanical instruments were used, if any, by the\r\npress at the conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Tape recorders and television cameras, as well as the usual\r\nnote pads and pencils, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was interviewed during the course of the press\r\nconference and photographed?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Malcolm Perry and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No one else?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you say then in the course of that\r\npress conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I described the President's wound in his head in very much\r\nthe same way as I have described it here. I was asked if this wound was\r\nan entrance wound, an exit wound, or what, and I said it could be an\r\nexit wound, but I felt it was a tangential wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which wound did you refer to at this time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The wound in the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you describe at that time what you meant by\r\n\"tangential\"?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What definition of \"tangential\" did you make at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. As I remember, I defined the word \"tangential\" as\r\nbeing--striking an object obliquely, not squarely or head on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe at this time in somewhat greater detail\r\nthe consequences of a tangential wound as contrasted with another type\r\nof a striking?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Let me begin by saying that the damage suffered by an organ\r\nwhen struck by a bullet or other missile----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that I interrupted the deposition\r\nfor about 2 minutes to ascertain what our afternoon schedule would be\r\nhere because the regular administration office ordinarily closes at 12\r\no'clock, which was just about 15 minutes ago, and then we resumed the\r\ndeposition of Dr. Clark as he was discussing the concept of tangential\r\nand other types of striking.\r\n\r\nGo ahead, Doctor.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The effects of any missile striking an organ or a function\r\nof the energy which is shed by the missile in passing through this\r\norgan when a bullet strikes the head, if it is able to pass through\r\nrapidly without shedding any energy into the brain, little damage\r\nresults, other than that part of the brain which is directly penetrated\r\nby the missile. However, if it strikes the skull at an angle, it must\r\nthen penetrate much more bone than normal, therefore, is likely to shed\r\nmore energy, striking the brain a more powerful blow.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in striking the bone in this manner, it may cause pieces of\r\nthe bone to be blown into the brain and thus act as secondary missiles.\r\nFinally, the bullet itself may be deformed and deflected so that it\r\nwould go through or penetrate parts of the brain, not in the usual\r\ndirect line it was proceeding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, referring back to the press conference, did you\r\ndefine a tangential wound at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what else did you state at the press conference at\r\n2:30 on November 22?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I stated that the President had lost considerable blood,\r\nthat one of the contributing causes of death was this massive blood\r\nloss, that I was unable to state how many wounds the President had\r\nsustained or from what angle they could have come.\r\n\r\nI finally remember stating that the President's wound was obviously a\r\nmassive one and was insurvivable.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Dr. Perry say at that time, during the course of\r\nthat press conference, when the cameras were operating?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. As I recall, Dr. Perry stated that there was a small\r\nwound in the President's throat, that he made the incision for the\r\ntracheotomy through this wound. He discovered that the trachea was\r\ndeviated so he felt that the missile had entered the President's chest.\r\nHe asked for chest tubes then to be placed in the pleural cavities. He\r\nwas asked if this wound in the throat was an entrance wound or an exit\r\nwound. He said it was small and clean so it could have been an entrance\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he say anything else that you can recollect now in\r\nresponse to the question of whether it was a wound of entrance or exit?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; I cannot recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you a part of a second press conference, Dr. Clark?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did that second press conference occur?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. On Saturday, the 23d.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Sometime in the morning, as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going back to the first press conference for just a\r\nminute, which television networks were involved on that?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Without sounding facetious, everyone, including some I had\r\nnever heard of.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you recollect any besides the three major\r\nnetworks--ABC, CBS, and NBC?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. This is all I remember. I remember seeing in the room\r\ntwo reporters from Dallas newspapers whom I know and the radio and\r\ntelevision stations were also present.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going back to the second conference which I had\r\nstarted asking you about, had you had an opportunity to tell me what\r\ntime of day that was?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. It was in the morning, as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what television stations or networks were involved in\r\nthat conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Again, all three major networks, and I believe through our\r\nlocal affiliates. It does not seem as though this one was as jammed and\r\nas full as the first one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who arranged that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. That press conference was arranged by Mr. Steve Landregan,\r\nassistant administrator and public relations officer for the hospital.\r\nThis is his office.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who spoke at that press conference while the\r\ntelevision cameras were grinding?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Perry and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Essentially the same thing as I had on the first press\r\nconference, again defining tangential, and again describing the\r\nPresident's wound as being massive and unsurvivable.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did Dr. Perry, at that time, say?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Perry said very little. He described the President's\r\ncondition as he first saw him, when he was first called, and he\r\ndescribed the manner in which he was called to the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he say anything about whether the neck wound was a\r\npoint of entry or exit?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I do not remember--I specifically discussed this--may I add\r\nsomething to what I said in the first press conference?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; please do, if you find something that comes to mind,\r\nplease feel free to add that.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. All right. Let me check what I remember Dr. Perry said at\r\nthe first press conference. He was asked if the neck wound could be a\r\nwound of entrance or appeared to be a wound of exit, and Dr. Perry said\r\nsomething like \"possibly or conceivably,\" or something of this sort.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, did he elaborate as to how that projectory would have\r\nbeen possible in that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. He did not elaborate on this. One of the reporters with\r\ngestures indicated the direction that such a bullet would have to take,\r\nand Dr. Perry quite obviously had to agree that this is the way it had\r\nto go to get from there to the top of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But that was a possible trajectory under the circumstances?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would that have been postulated in terms of striking\r\nspecific parts of the body?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Well, on a speculation, this would mean that the missile\r\nwould have had to have been fired from below--upward or that the\r\nPresident was hanging upside down.\r\n\r\nMe. SPECTER. Did Dr. Perry discuss anything with you prior to that\r\nsecond conference about a telephone call from Washington, D.C.?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate briefly what Dr. Perry told you about\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; Dr. Perry stated that he had talked to the Bethesda\r\nNaval Hospital on two occasions that morning and that he knew what the\r\nautopsy findings had shown and that he did not wish to be questioned by\r\nthe press, as he had been asked by Bethesda to confine his remarks to\r\nthat which he knew from having examined the President, and suggested\r\nthat the major part of this press conference be conducted by me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was anyone else present when he expressed those thoughts\r\nto you?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I believe that Mr. Price and Dr. Shires were present. I\r\ncould be wrong on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you a part of a third press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did that occur?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. During the following week--I have forgotten exactly the day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what networks were involved at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. It was CBS.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that a television conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; this was filmed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who arranged that conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Again, Mr. Landregan.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who spoke at that conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Shires, Dr. Baxter, Dr. McClelland, Dr.\r\nJenkins, Dr. Gieseke, and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Dr. Perry there at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; Dr. Perry was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly what you said at that time, if\r\nit differed in any way from what you said before?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; it did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Dr. Perry say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Essentially the same thing that he had said before,\r\ndescribing the wound in the throat, describing the condition of the\r\nPresident, how he was called and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he comment at that time as to whether it was an\r\nentrance wound or an exit wound or what?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did Dr. Shaw say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Shaw described Governor Connally's chest wound. He\r\ndescribed what was done for him, the operation in some detail. He\r\ndescribed the fact that Governor Connally was conscious up until the\r\ntime he was anesthetized in the operating room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did Dr. Shires say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Shires described the wounds suffered by Oswald and what\r\nwas done in an attempt to save him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about Dr. Gieseke, what did he say?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Gieseke corroborated Dr. Shaw's statements regarding\r\nGovernor Connally's condition and his remaining conscious until he was\r\nanesthetized by Dr. Gieseke.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Dr. Baxter say at that conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Baxter described President Kennedy's condition as he saw\r\nit, stated that he had assisted in the placing in the chest tubes on\r\nPresident Kennedy, and that he had been present at Oswald's operation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Baxter describe the neck wound that President\r\nKennedy suffered with specific respect as to whether it was point of\r\nentry or exit?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I don't remember--I don't believe he did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have we covered all the doctors who spoke at that\r\npress conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Except Dr. Jenkins.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did Dr. Jenkins say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Jenkins described being called to attend President\r\nKennedy, how he got there with his anesthesia machine, that he found\r\nan endotracheal tube had already been inserted. He hooked up and he\r\ndescribed the activities in the emergency room, operating room No. 1,\r\nand he described the stopping of the President's heart and the decision\r\nto pronounce him dead. He went ahead to describe the operation on Mr.\r\nOswald and the extent of blood loss, etc., which he had sustained.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you involved in still a subsequent press\r\nconference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And with whom was that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. This was with NBC and was approximately 2 weeks after the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who arranged that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Mr. Landregan.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that filmed?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, that was also filmed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who spoke at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I spoke alone as a representative of the department and so\r\nstated in the conference.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Essentially the same thing as had been stated before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were you a part of still another press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was that?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The week after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And with whom was that press conference?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. With BBC.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who arranged that?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Mr. Landregan, again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did anyone else participate in that press conference\r\nwith you?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was that televised, filmed, or simply recorded?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. It was simply recorded.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you say at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Exactly the same thing as I have said at the previous\r\nconferences, describing the President's condition, his wound, and what\r\ntranspired after I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At any of the press conferences were you asked about a\r\nhole on the left side of the President's head?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At which conference or conferences?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I was asked about this at the CBS conference and I stated\r\nthat I personally saw no such wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who asked you about it at that time, if you recall?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. The man who was conducting the conference. This was brought\r\nup by one of the physicians, I think Dr. McClelland, that there was\r\nsome discussion of such a wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. McClelland say that he had seen such a wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the origin, if you know, as to the inquiry on the\r\nwound, that is, who suggested that there might have been a wound on the\r\nleft side?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I don't recall--I don't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had there been some comment that the priests made a\r\ncomment that there was a wound on the left side of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I heard this subsequently from one of the reporters who\r\nattended the press conference with NBC.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were priests actually in trauma room 1?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were they in relation to the President at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. They were on the right side of the President's body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you described the massive wound at the top of the\r\nPresident's head, with the brain protruding; did you observe any other\r\nhole or wound on the President's head?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe, to make my question very specific, a\r\nbullet hole or what appeared to be a bullet hole in the posterior\r\nscalp, approximately 2.5 cm. laterally to the right, slightly above the\r\nexternal occipital protuberant, measuring 15 by 6 mm.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; I did not. This could have easily been hidden in\r\nthe blood and hair.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any bullet wounds or any other wound on\r\nthe back side of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the President ever turned over while he was in the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Not in my presence; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you leave before, with, or after all the other\r\ndoctors who were in attendance?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I left after all the other doctors who were in attendance,\r\nbecause I stayed with Dr. Burkley until we had the death certificate\r\nsigned and the arrangements had been made to transport the President's\r\nbody out of Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say Dr. Burkley or Buckley?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Dr. Burkley.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's the President's private physician?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Clark, would your observations be consistent with some\r\nother alleged facts in this matter, such as the presence of a lateral\r\nwound measuring 15 by 6 mm. on the posterior scalp approximately 2.5\r\ncm. laterally to the right and slightly above the external occipital\r\nproturberant--that is to say, could such a hole have been present\r\nwithout your observing it?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, in the presence of this much destruction of skull and\r\nscalp above such a wound and lateral to it and the brief period of time\r\navailable for examination--yes, such a wound could be present.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The physicians, surgeons who examined the President at the\r\nautopsy specifically, Commander James J. Humes, H-u-m-e-s (spelling);\r\nCommander J. Thornton Boswell, B-o-s-w-e-l-l (spelling), and Lt. Col.\r\nPierre A. Finck, F-i-n-c-k (spelling), expressed the joint opinion\r\nthat the wound which I have just described as being 15 by 6 mm.\r\nand 2.5 cm. to the right and slightly above the external occipital\r\nprotuberant was a point of entrance of a bullet in the President's\r\nhead at a time when the President's head was moved slightly forward\r\nwith his chin dropping into his chest, when he was riding in an open\r\ncar at a slightly downhill position. With those facts being supplied\r\nto them in a hypothetical fashion, they concluded that the bullet\r\nwould have taken a more or less straight course, exiting from the\r\ncenter of the President's skull at a point indicated by an opening\r\nfrom three portions of the skull reconstructed, which had been brought\r\nto them--would those findings and those conclusions be consistent\r\nwith your observations if you assumed the additional facts which I\r\nhave brought to your attention, in addition to those which you have\r\npersonally observed?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Clark, in the line of your specialty, could you\r\ncomment as to the status of the President with respect to competency,\r\nhad he been able to survive the head injuries which you have described\r\nand the total wound which he had?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. This, of course, is a question of tremendous importance.\r\nJust let me state that the loss of cerebrellar tissue would probably\r\nhave been of minimal consequence in the performance of his duties. The\r\nloss of the right occipital and probably part of the right parietal\r\nlobes would have been of specific importance. This would have led to a\r\nvisual field deficit, which would have interfered in a major way with\r\nhis ability to read, not the interpretation of reading matter per se,\r\nbut the acquisition of information from the printed page. He would have\r\nhad specific difficulty with finding the next line in a book or paper.\r\nThis would have proven to be a specific handicap in getting information\r\non which, as the President of the United States, he would have to act.\r\n\r\nHow much damage he would have had to his motor system, that is, the\r\nability to control or coordinate his left extremities, I would not\r\nknow. This conceivably could have been a problem in enabling him to\r\nmove about, to appear in public, et cetera. Finally, and probably most\r\nimportant, since the brain, as far as at its higher levels, largely as\r\na unit, the loss of this much brain tissue likely would have impaired\r\nhis ability in abstract reasoning, imagination; whereas, the part of\r\nthe President's brain struck is not that part specifically concerned\r\nwith these matters. The effect of loss of considerable brain tissue\r\ndoes affect the total performance of the organ in these matters. There\r\nwould be grave doubts in my mind as to our ability as physicians to\r\ngive a clear answer regarding his ability to function as President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nOur ability to judge this is sometimes sorely tried when dealing with\r\npeople with considerably less intellectual and moral demands made upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, did you prepare certain written reports based on\r\nyour participation in the treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I now show you a document which has been supplied to\r\nthe President's Commission, which we have marked as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 392, and I now show you the second and third sheets, which purport\r\nto be the summary made by you and ask if that was prepared by you?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, are the facts set forth in those two sheets true and\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I now show you a 2-3/4-page summary which purports to\r\nbear your signature, being dated November 22, 1963, and I ask you if\r\nthat, in fact, is your signature?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, was, in fact, this report made in your own hand\r\nconcerning the treatment which you rendered to the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts set forth therein true and correct?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you made any other written report or other writings\r\nof any sort concerning this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed or discussed this matter with\r\nany Federal representative prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And whom did you talk to?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I talked to an FBI agent a few days after the assassination,\r\nin Mr. Jack Price's office.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who is Mr. Price, for the record at this point?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. He is the administrator of Parkland Memorial Hospital. This\r\nagent asked me if I had recovered any missiles or fragments of missiles\r\nfrom the President's body. I said I did not, and he asked me if I knew\r\nof anyone in Parkland Hospital who had recovered such evidence and I\r\nassured him I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he ask you anything further?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you tell him anything further?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir. I offered to answer any questions he might have\r\nasked and he said that was all he wished to know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you talk to any other representative of the\r\nFederal Government at any time before today?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; I talked to a member of the Secret Service\r\napproximately a month after the assassination. I talked to him on\r\ntwo occasions, once by phone, and he asked me if I had a copy of the\r\nwritten report submitted by Dr. Ronald Jones, and I told him I did not.\r\n\r\nI subsequently talked to him in person. He showed me the summary that I\r\nprepared and sent to Dr. Burkley, the same document I just identified\r\nhere, and my own handwritten report of the events of the afternoon of\r\nthe 22d of November. He asked me if I prepared these and I told him I\r\nhad. He asked me if I had any other written records. I told him I did\r\nnot. He said, \"Do you have any additional information than you have\r\nwritten?\" I said I did not. He thanked me very much for coming.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now summarized all of the conversations you have\r\nhad with any representative of the Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had any conversations with any representative\r\nof the State government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before you were sworn in to have your deposition taken,\r\ndid you and I have a discussion about this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir; a pleasant discussion of what the function of this\r\nCommission is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, also, all of what I would be asking once the record\r\nwas open and we started taking your deposition?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have we covered on the record with the court reporter\r\ntranscribing all the subjects which you and I discussed informally and\r\nprior to the start of the more formal session here?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything which you would care to add, which\r\nyou think might possibly be helpful to the Commission in any way, Dr.\r\nClark?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir; I'm afraid I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming. We surely appreciate it,\r\nDr. Clark. Thank you, Dr. Clark.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. KEMP CLARK RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Kemp Clark was taken at 12:05 p.m., on March\r\n25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Kemp Clark has returned to\r\nhave a few additional questions asked of him following the deposition\r\nwhich was taken on March 21.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark, the purpose of this additional deposition is the same as the\r\nfirst one, except that I am going to ask you a few additional questions\r\nbased upon a translation of an article which appeared in \"L' Express\",\r\nwhich has been provided to me since the deposition of last Saturday.\r\n\r\nWould you please stand up again and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Clark, I have made available to you, have I not, what\r\npurports to be a translation from French of the \"L' Express\" issue of\r\nFebruary 20, 1964?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And let me read for the record and for you this excerpt.\r\n\r\n\"On his part according to the New York Times of November 27, 'Dr. Kemp\r\nClark, who signed the Kennedy death certificate, declared that a bullet\r\nhit him right where the knot of his necktie was.' He added,\" apparently\r\nreferring to you, \"'this bullet penetrated into his chest and did not\r\ncome out'. The surgeon went on to say that the second wound of the\r\nPresident was 'tangential' and that it had been caused by a bullet\r\nwhich hit 'the right side of his head'\".\r\n\r\nDr. Clark, my first question is--what, if anything, did you say to a\r\nNew York Times representative or anyone, for that matter, with respect\r\nto whether a bullet hit the President where the knot of his necktie was.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I remember using the phrase to describe the location of a\r\nwound in the President's throat as being at the point of his knot of\r\nhis necktie. I do not recall ever specifically stating that this was\r\nan entrance wound, as has been said before. I was not present when\r\nthe President arrived and did not see this wound. If any statement\r\nregarding its entrance or exit was made by me, it was indicating that\r\nthere was a small wound described there by the physicians who first saw\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nA specific quotation regarding entrance or exit, I feel, is a partial\r\nquotation or incompletely quoted from me. The part pertaining to the\r\nbullet entering the President's chest rests on the reasons for the\r\nplacing of the chest tubes which were being inserted when I arrived. It\r\nwas the assumption, based on the previously described deviation of the\r\ntrachea and the presence of blood in the strap muscles of the neck that\r\na wound or missile wound might have entered the President's chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, what was there, Dr. Clark, in the deviation of the\r\ntrachea and the presence of blood in the strap muscles of the neck\r\nwhich so indicated?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Assuming that a missile had entered the pleural space, if\r\nthere had been bleeding into the pleural space, the trachea would have\r\nbeen deviated or had there been leakage of air into the pleural space,\r\nthe trachea would have been deviated, as it is the main conduit of\r\nair to the two lungs. Collapse of a lung would have produced, or will\r\nproduce deviation of the trachea. There being a wound in the throat,\r\nthere being blood in the strap muscles and there being deviation of\r\nthe trachea in the presence of a grievously wounded patient without\r\nopportunity for X-ray or other diagnostic measures, Dr. Perry assumed\r\nthat the findings in the neck were due to penetration of the missile\r\ninto the chest. For this reason, he requested chest tubes to be placed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is the deviation of the trachea and the presence of\r\nbleeding on the strap muscles of the neck and the other factors which\r\nyou have recited equally consistent with a wound of exit on the neck?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir. Furthermore, let me say that the presence of the\r\ndeviation of the trachea, with blood in the strap muscles, are by no\r\nmeans diagnostic of penetration of the chest, and the placing of the\r\nchest tubes was prophylactic had such an eventuality occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any external indication that there was a missile\r\nin the chest?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it the preliminary thought that the missile might have\r\nbeen in the chest by virtue of the fact that this wound was noted on\r\nthe neck?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes; with the other factors I have enumerated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at that time, not knowing what the angle might have\r\nbeen or any of the surrounding circumstances, then you proceeded to\r\ntake precautionary measures as if there might have been a missile in\r\nthe chest at some point?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. That is correct. Measures were taken, assuming the worst had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As the quotation appears in the issue of \"L' Express,\"\r\n\"This bullet penetrated into his chest and did not come out,\" would\r\nthat then be an accurate quotation of something that you said, Dr.\r\nClark?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Clark, while you are here again, I would like to ask\r\nyou a few additional questions.\r\n\r\nLet the record show that since I have taken your deposition, I have\r\ntaken the depositions of many additional witnesses and none has been\r\ntranscribed, so I am not in a position to refer to a record to see what\r\nI asked you before or to frankly recollect precisely what I asked you\r\nbefore, so, to some extent these questions may be overlapping.\r\n\r\nDid you observe the President's back at that time when he was in the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the reason for your not looking at his back?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. First, the duration of time that the President was alive in\r\nthe emergency room was a brief duration. All efforts were bent toward\r\nsaving his life rather than inspection for precise location of wounds.\r\nAfter his death it was not our position to try to evaluate all of the\r\nconceivable organs or areas of the body, knowing that an autopsy would\r\nbe performed and that this would be far more meaningful than a cursory\r\nexternal examination here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any bleeding wound in the President's back?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. In the back of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But how about on the back of his body, was there any\r\nbleeding wound noted?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Since we did not turn the President over, I cannot answer\r\nthat specifically. We saw none, as I previously stated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you undertake any action to ascertain whether there\r\nhad been a violation to a major extent of the back part of his body?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is, none was taken by you personally?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Carrico testified earlier today, being the first\r\ndoctor to reach him, that he felt the President's back to determine\r\nwhether there was any major violation of that area.\r\n\r\nWould that be a customary action to take to ascertain whether there was\r\nany major wound, by the doctor who first examined the patient?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming that the President had a bullet wound of entry on\r\nthe upper right posterior thorax, just above the upper border of the\r\nscapula, 14 cms. from the right acromion process, 14 cm. below the tip\r\nof the right mastoid process, would there have been a bloody type wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. I'm sorry--your question?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would such a wound of entry by a missile traveling\r\napproximately 2,000 feet per second, approximately 6.5 mm. in diameter,\r\ncause a bloody type of a wound?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir. Such a wound could have easily been overlooked in\r\nthe presence of the much larger wound in the right occipital region of\r\nthe President's skull, from which considerable blood loss had occurred\r\nwhich stained the back of his head, neck and upper shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Clark, I want to ask you a question as it is raised\r\nhere in \"L' Express\".\r\n\r\n\"How did the practitioner who signed the death certificate of the\r\nPresident fail to take the trouble to turn him over?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, that refers to you and will you give me your answer to that\r\nquestion, as the news media has posed it?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Quite simply, as I previously stated, the duration of time\r\nthe President was alive was occupied by attempts to save his life.\r\nWhen these failed, further examination of the patient's body was not\r\ndone, as it was felt that little could be gained or learned that\r\nwould be helpful in deciding the course of events leading up to his\r\nassassination, that is, examination by me, as I knew an autopsy would\r\nbe performed which would be far more meaningful and revealing than any\r\ncursory external examination conducted in the emergency room by me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was the action taken by you in signing the death\r\ncertificate based upon the examination which you made in accordance\r\nwith what you believed to be good medical practice?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that the characterization here of \"L' Express\" that\r\nthe failure to turn the President over would not constitute gross\r\nnegligence in your professional judgment, as they have characterized it\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir. One other point, if I may here?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. In order to move the President's body to Bethesda where\r\nthe autopsy was to be performed, a death certificate had to be\r\nfilled out in conformance with Texas State law to allow the body to\r\nbe transported. This is the second part of the signing of the death\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add, Dr. Clark, which you think\r\nmight be helpful at all in the inquiry being made by the President's\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I chat for just a moment or two about the\r\nquestions I would ask you on this supplemental deposition before it\r\nwent on the record?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you talked to any representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment between the time I took your deposition last Saturday and\r\nthis Wednesday morning?\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Clark.\r\n\r\nDr. CLARK. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ROBERT NELSON McCLELLAND\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Robert Nelson McClelland was taken on March\r\n21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give in these\r\nproceedings will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, the purpose of this proceeding is to\r\ntake your deposition in connection with an investigation which is\r\nbeing conducted by the President's Commission on the Assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, and the specific purpose of our requesting you\r\nto answer questions relates to the topic of the medical care which\r\nPresident Kennedy received at Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. McClelland, will you tell us your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Robert Nelson McClelland.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you received a letter from the Commission which\r\nenclosed a copy of the Executive order creating the Commission, and a\r\ncopy of the Congressional Resolution pertaining to the Commission, and\r\na copy of the procedures for taking testimony under the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is it satisfactory with you to answer these questions\r\nfor us today, even though you haven't had the 3 days between the time\r\nof the receipt of the letter and today?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I am a doctor of medicine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nstarting with your graduation from college, please?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Since graduation from college I attended medical\r\nschool at the University of Texas, medical branch in Galveston, Tex.,\r\nand received the M.D. degree from that school in 1954. I then went to\r\nKansas City, Kans., where I did a rotating internship at the University\r\nof Kansas Medical Center from June 1954 to June 1955. Following that\r\nperiod I was a general medical officer in the Air Force for 2 years\r\nin Germany, and subsequent to my release from active duty, I became\r\na general surgery resident at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas\r\nin August of 1957. I remained at Parkland from that date to August\r\n1959, at which time I entered private practice for ten months, and\r\nthen reentered my general surgery training program at Parkland in June\r\n1960. I completed my 4 years of general surgical training in June 1962.\r\nFollowing that time I became a full-time instructor of surgery on the\r\nstaff of the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical School, and I am\r\nat the present time an associate professor of surgery at that school.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, in connection with your duties at Parkland\r\nHospital, or before, have you had any experience with gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where in your background did you acquire that experience?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Largely during residency training and subsequent to\r\nthat in my capacity here on the staff.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what has provided the opportunity for your experience\r\nhere at Parkland in residency training and on the staff with respect to\r\nacquiring knowledge of gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Largely this has been related to the type of hospital\r\nwhich Parkland is; namely, City-County Hospital which receives all\r\nof the indigent patients of this county, many of whom are involved\r\nfrequently in shooting altercations, so that we do see a large number\r\nof that type patient almost daily.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you approximate for me the total number of gunshot\r\nwounds which you have had an opportunity to observe?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I would estimate that it would be in excess of 200.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your duty assignment back on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. At that time I was showing a film on surgical\r\ntechniques to a group of students and residents on the second floor of\r\nParkland Hospital in the surgical suite, where I was notified of the\r\nfact that President Kennedy was being brought to the Parkland emergency\r\nroom after having been shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action, if any, did you take following that\r\nnotification?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Immediately upon hearing that, I accompanied the\r\nResident, Dr. Crenshaw, who brought this news to me, to the emergency\r\nroom, and down to the trauma room 1 where President Kennedy had been\r\ntaken immediately upon arrival.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And approximately what time did you arrive in Emergency\r\nRoom 1?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. This is a mere approximation, but I would approximate\r\nor estimate, rather, about 12:40.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present, if anyone, at the time of your\r\narrival?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. At the time I arrived, Dr. Perry--would you like the\r\nfull names of all these?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be fine, I would appreciate that.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. Charles Baxter, Dr. Charles\r\nCrenshaw, Dr. James Carrico, Dr. Paul Peters.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they all present at the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. They were not present when I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you start with the ones who were present?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Starting with the ones who were present, I'm sorry,\r\nthe ones who were present when I arrived were Drs. Carrico, Perry and\r\nBaxter. The others I mentioned arrived subsequently or about the same\r\ntime that I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then, what other doctors, if any, arrived after you did,\r\nin addition to those whom you have already mentioned?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. In addition, the ones that arrived afterwards, were Dr.\r\nKenneth Salyer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. S-a-l-y-e-r?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. S-a-l-y-e-r, Dr. Fouad, F-o-u-a-d Bashour, Dr. Donald\r\nSeldin----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. S-e-l-d-i-n?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. S-e-l-d-i-n--I believe that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to President Kennedy's condition\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Well, on initially coming into the room and inspecting\r\nhim from a distance of only 2 or 3 feet as I put on a pair of surgical\r\ngloves, it was obvious that he had sustained a probably mortal head\r\ninjury, and that his face was extremely swollen and suffused with blood\r\nappeared cyanotic----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. \"Cyanotic\"--may I interrupt--just what do you mean by that\r\nin lay terms?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. This mean bluish discoloration, bluish-black\r\ndiscoloration of the tissue. The eyes were somewhat protuberant,\r\nwhich is usually seen after massive head injuries denoting increased\r\nintracranial pressure, and it seemed that he perhaps was not making, at\r\nthe time at least, spontaneous respiratory movements, but was receiving\r\nartificial respiration from a machine, an anesthesia machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was operating that machine?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The machine--there was a changeover, just as I came\r\nin, one of the doctors in the room, I don't recall which one, had been\r\noperating what we call an intermittent positive pressure breathing\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had that machine been utilized prior to your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. It was in use as I arrived, yes, and about the same\r\ntime I arrived--this would be one other doctor who came in the\r\nroom that I forgot about--Dr. Jenkins, M. T. Jenkins, professor of\r\nanesthesiology, came into the room with a larger anesthesia machine,\r\nwhich is a better type machine with which to maintain control of\r\nrespiration, and this was then attached to the tube in the President's\r\ntracheotom; anyway, respiratory movements were being made for him with\r\nthese two machines, which were in the process of being changed when I\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\nThen, as I took my post to help with the tracheotomy, I was standing at\r\nthe end of the stretcher on which the President was lying, immediately\r\nat his head, for purposes of holding a tracheotom, or a retractory in\r\nthe neck line.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe, if anything, as to the status of the\r\nneck wound when you first arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The neck wound, when I first arrived, was at this time\r\nconverted into a tracheotomy incision. The skin incision had been made\r\nby Dr. Perry, and he told me--although I did not see that--that he had\r\nmade the incision through a very small, perhaps less than one quarter\r\ninch in diameter wound in the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall whether he described it any more precisely\r\nthan that?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. He did not at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has he ever described it any more precisely for you?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. He has since that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what description has he given of it since that time?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. As well as I can recall, the description that he gave\r\nwas essentially as I have just described, that it was a very small\r\ninjury, with clear cut, although somewhat irregular margins of less\r\nthan a quarter inch in diameter, with minimal tissue damage surrounding\r\nit on the skin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was there anything left for you to observe of that\r\nbullet wound, or had the incision obliterated it?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The incision had obliterated it, essentially, the skin\r\nportion, that is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Before proceeding to describe what you did in connection\r\nwith the tracheostomy, will you more fully describe your observation\r\nwith respect to the head wound?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. As I took the position at the head of the table that\r\nI have already described, to help out with the tracheotomy, I was in\r\nsuch a position that I could very closely examine the head wound, and I\r\nnoted that the right posterior portion of the skull had been extremely\r\nblasted. It had been shattered, apparently, by the force of the shot so\r\nthat the parietal bone was protruded up through the scalp and seemed to\r\nbe fractured almost along its right posterior half, as well as some of\r\nthe occipital bone being fractured in its lateral half, and this sprung\r\nopen the bones that I mentioned in such a way that you could actually\r\nlook down into the skull cavity itself and see that probably a third or\r\nso, at least, of the brain tissue, posterior cerebral tissue and some\r\nof the cerebellar tissue had been blasted out. There was a large amount\r\nof bleeding which was occurring mainly from the large venous channels\r\nin the skull which had been blasted open.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he alive at the time you first saw him?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I really couldn't say, because as I mentioned in the\r\nhectic activity--I really couldn't say what his blood pressure was or\r\nwhat his pulse was or anything of that sort. The only thing I could say\r\nthat would perhaps give evidence--this is not vital activity--at most,\r\nis that maybe he made one or two spontaneous respiratory movements but\r\nit would be difficult to say, since the machine was being used on him,\r\nwhether these were true spontaneous respirations or not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you now describe the activity and part that you\r\nperformed in the treatment which followed your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes; as I say, all I did was simply assist Dr. Perry\r\nand Dr. Baxter in doing the tracheotomy. All three of us worked\r\ntogether in making an incision in the neck, tracting the neck muscles\r\nout of the way, and making a small opening into the trachea near the\r\nspot where the trachea had already been blasted or torn open by the\r\nfragment of the bullet, and inserting a large metal tracheotomy tube\r\ninto this hole, and after this the breathing apparatus was attached to\r\nthis instead of the previous tube which had been placed here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In conducting that operation, did you observe any interior\r\ndamage to the President?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe that for me, please?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. That damage consisted mainly of a large amount of\r\ncontusion and hematoma formation in the tissue lateral to the right\r\nside of the trachea and the swelling and bleeding around this site\r\nwas to such extent that the trachea was somewhat deviated to the left\r\nside, not a great deal, but to a degree at least that it required\r\npartial cutting of some of the neck muscles in order to get good enough\r\nexposure to put in the tracheotomy tube, but there was a good deal of\r\nsoft tissue damage and damage to the trachea itself where apparently\r\nthe missile had gone between the trachea on the right side and the\r\nstrap muscles which were applied closely to it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other treatment was given to President Kennedy at the\r\ntime you were performing the procedures you have just described?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. To the best of my knowledge, the other treatment had\r\nconsisted of the placement of cutdown sites in his extremities, namely,\r\nthe making of incisions over large veins in the arms and, I believe, in\r\nthe leg; however, I'm not sure about that, since I was not paying too\r\nmuch attention to that part of the activity, and large plastic tubes\r\nwere placed into these veins for the giving of blood and fluids, and\r\nas I recall, he received a certain amount of blood, but I don't know\r\nexactly how much, since I was not actually giving the blood.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, of course, while we were working on the\r\ntracheotomy incision, the other physicians that I have mentioned were\r\nattaching the President rapidly to a cardiac monitor, that is to say,\r\nan electrocardiogram, for checking the presence of cardiac activity,\r\nand in addition, chest tubes were being placed in the right and left\r\nchest--both, as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall who was placing those tubes?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. One of the tubes, I believe, was placed by Dr. Peters.\r\nThe other one, I'm not right certain, I don't really recall--I perhaps\r\nbetter not say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know about how long that took in placing those\r\nchest tubes?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. As well as I am aware, the tubes were both placed in.\r\nWhat this involves is simply putting a trocar, a large hollow tube, and\r\nthat is put into the small incision, into the anterior chest wall and\r\nslipping the tube into the chest between a group of ribs for purposes\r\nof relieving any collection of air or fluid which is present in the\r\nlungs. The reason this was done was because it was felt that there was\r\nprobably quite possibly a mediastinal injury with perhaps suffusion of\r\nblood and air into one or both pleural cavities.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What effect did this medical treatment have on President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. As near as we could tell, unfortunately, none. We felt\r\nthat from the time we saw him, most of us agreed, all of us agreed\r\nrather, that this was a mortal wound, but that in spite of this feeling\r\nthat all attempts possible should be made to revive him, as far as\r\nestablishing the airway breathing for him, and replacing blood and what\r\nnot, but unfortunately the loss of blood and the loss of cerebral and\r\ncerebellar tissues were so great that the efforts were of no avail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he conscious at that time that you saw him?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, at what time did he expire?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. He was pronounced dead at 1 p.m. on November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the cause of death in your opinion?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The cause of death, I would say, would be massive head\r\ninjuries with loss of large amounts of cerebral and cerebellar tissues\r\nand massive blood loss.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe anything in the nature of a wound on his\r\nbody other than that which you have already described for me?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what position was President Kennedy maintained from the\r\ntime you saw him until the pronouncement of death?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. On his back on the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On his what?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. On his back on the stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he on the stretcher at all times?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In the trauma room No. 1 you described, is there any table\r\nonto which he could be placed from the stretcher?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No; generally we do not move patients from the\r\nstretcher until they are ready to go into the operating room and then\r\nthey are moved onto the operating table.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, in fact, was he left on the stretcher all during the\r\ncourse of these procedures until he was pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then, at any time was he positioned in a way where you\r\ncould have seen the back of his body?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any gunshot wound on his back?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had discussions with the other doctors who\r\nattended President Kennedy as to the possible nature of the wound which\r\nwas inflicted on him?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what facts did you have available either to you or to\r\nthe other doctors whom you talked this over with, with respect to the\r\nnature of the wound, source of the wounds, and that sort of thing?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Immediately we had essentially no facts. We knew\r\nnothing of the number of bullets that had supposedly been fired.\r\nWe knew nothing of the site from which the bullet had been fired,\r\nessentially none of the circumstances in the first few minutes, say, 20\r\nor 30 minutes after the President was brought in, so that our initial\r\nimpressions were based upon extremely incomplete information.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your initial impressions?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The initial impression that we had was that perhaps the\r\nwound in the neck, the anterior part of the neck, was an entrance wound\r\nand that it had perhaps taken a trajectory off the anterior vertebral\r\nbody and again into the skull itself, exiting out the back, to produce\r\nthe massive injury in the head. However, this required some straining\r\nof the imagination to imagine that this would happen, and it was much\r\neasier to explain the apparent trajectory by means of two bullets,\r\nwhich we later found out apparently had been fired, than by just one\r\nthen, on which basis we were originally taking to explain it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Through the use of the pronoun \"we\" in your last answer,\r\nto whom do you mean by \"we\"?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Essentially all of the doctors that have previously\r\nbeen mentioned here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe the condition of the back of the\r\nPresident's head?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Well, partially; not, of course, as I say, we did not\r\nlift his head up since it was so greatly damaged. We attempted to avoid\r\nmoving him any more than it was absolutely necessary, but I could see,\r\nof course, all the extent of the wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You saw a large opening which you have already described?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I saw the large opening which I have described.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other wound on the back of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe a small gunshot wound below the large\r\nopening on the back of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Based on the experience that you have described for us\r\nwith gunshot wounds and your general medical experience, would you\r\ncharacterize the description of the wound that Dr. Perry gave you as\r\nbeing a wound of entrance or a wound of exit, or was the description\r\nwhich you got from Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter and Dr. Carrico who were\r\nthere before, equally consistent with whether or not it was a wound of\r\nentrance or a wound of exit, or how would you characterize it in your\r\nwords?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I would say it would be equally consistent with either\r\ntype wound, either an entrance or an exit type wound. It would be quite\r\ndifficult to say--impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, I show you now a statement or a report\r\nwhich has been furnished to the Commission by Parkland Hospital and\r\nhas been identified in a previous Commission hearing as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 392, and I direct your attention specifically to a page,\r\n\"Third Report\", which was made by you, and I would ask you first of all\r\nif this is your signature which appears at the bottom of Page 2, and\r\nnext, whether in fact you did make this report and submit it to the\r\nauthorities at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are all the facts set forth true and correct to the\r\nbest of your knowledge, information and belief?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. To the best of my knowledge, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, did you and I sit down together for just a\r\nfew minutes before I started to take your deposition today?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I discussed this matter with you?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, during the course of our conversations at that time,\r\ndid we cover the same material in question form here and to which you\r\nhave responded in answer form with the court reporter here today?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And has the information which you have given me on the\r\nrecord been the same as that which you gave me off of the record in\r\nadvance?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any interest, Dr. McClelland in reading your\r\ntestimony over or signing it at the end, or would you be willing to\r\nwaive any such signature of the testimony?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I would be willing to waive my signature.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you so much for coming and giving us your deposition\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. All right, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ROBERT M. McCLELLAND RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Robert M. McClelland was taken at 3:25 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Robert M. McClelland has\r\nreturned to have a brief additional deposition concerning a translation\r\nof \"L' Express\" which has been called to my attention in the\r\nintervening time which has elapsed between March 21, when I took Dr.\r\nMcClelland's deposition on the first occasion, and today.\r\n\r\nDr. McClelland, will you raise your right hand? Do you solemnly swear\r\nthat the testimony you will give to the President's Commission in this\r\ndeposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, I show you a translation from the French,\r\nof the magazine, \"L' Express\" issue of February 20, 1964, and ask you\r\nif you would read this item, with particular emphasis on a reference to\r\na quotation or statement made by you to a reporter from the St. Louis\r\nPost Dispatch.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. (Examined instrument referred to.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you had an opportunity to read over that excerpt?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you talk to a reporter from the St. Louis Post\r\nDispatch about this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was his name?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Richard Dudman.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did you have that conversation with Mr. Dudman?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. As well as I recall, it was the day after the\r\nassassination, as nearly as I can recall, but I'm not certain about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you tell me as closely as you remember what he said\r\nto you and you said to him, please?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The main point he seemed to be making was to attempt\r\nto define something about the wound, the nature of the wound, and\r\nas near as I can recall, I indicated to him that the wound was a\r\nsmall undamaged--appearing punctate area in the skin of the neck,\r\nthe anterior part of the neck, which had the appearance of the usual\r\nentrance wound of a bullet, but that this certainly could not be--you\r\ncouldn't make a statement to that effect with any complete degree of\r\ncertainty, though we were, as I told him, experienced in seeing wounds\r\nof this nature, and usually felt that we could tell the difference\r\nbetween an entrance and an exit wound, and this was, I think, in\r\nessence what I told him about the nature of the wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, had you actually observed the wound prior to the time\r\nthe tracheotomy was performed on that neck wound?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No; my knowledge of the entrance wound, as I stated,\r\nin my former deposition, was merely from what Dr. Perry told me when\r\nI entered the room and began putting on a pair of surgical gloves to\r\nassist with the tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nDr. Perry looked up briefly and said that they had made an incision and\r\nwere in the process of making an incision in the neck, which extended\r\nthrough the middle of the wound in question in the front of the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you have just characterized it in that last answer as\r\nan entrance wound.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Well, perhaps I shouldn't say the wound anyway, not the\r\nentrance wound--that might be a slip of the tongue.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have a firm opinion at this time as to whether it\r\nis an entrance wound or exit wound or whatever?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Of course, my opinion now would be colored by\r\neverything that I've heard about it and seen since, but I'll say this,\r\nif I were simply looking at the wound again and had seen the wound in\r\nits unchanged state, and which I did not, and, of course, as I say, it\r\nhad already been opened up by the tracheotomy incision when I saw the\r\nwound--but if I saw the wound in its state in which Dr. Perry described\r\nit to me, I would probably initially think this were an entrance wound,\r\nknowing nothing about the circumstances as I did at the time, but I\r\nreally couldn't say--that's the whole point. This would merely be a\r\ncalculated guess, and that's all, not knowing anything more than just\r\nseeing the wound itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But did you, in fact, see the wound prior to the time the\r\nincision was made?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that any preliminary thought you had even, would be\r\nbased upon what you had been told by Dr. Perry?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you tell Mr. Dudman of the St. Louis Post\r\nDispatch that you did not in fact see the wound in the neck, but your\r\nonly information of it came from what Dr. Perry had told you?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I don't recall whether I told him that or not. I really\r\ndon't remember whether I said I had seen the wound myself or whether\r\nI was merely referring to our sort of collective opinion of it, or\r\nwhether I told him I had not seen the wound and was merely going by Dr.\r\nPerry's report of it to me. I don't recall now, this far away in time\r\nexactly what I said to him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, I want to ask you a few additional\r\nquestions, and some of these questions may duplicate questions which I\r\nasked you last Saturday, and the reason for that is, we have not yet\r\nhad a chance to transcribe the deposition of last Saturday, so I do not\r\nhave before me the questions I asked you at that time and the answers\r\nyou gave, and since last Saturday I have taken the depositions of many,\r\nmany doctors on the same topics, so it is not possible for me to be\r\nabsolutely certain of the specific questions which I asked you at that\r\ntime, but permit me to ask you one or several more questions on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFirst, how many bullets do you think were involved in inflicting the\r\nwounds on President Kennedy which you observed?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. At the present time, you mean, or at the immediate\r\nmoment?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, take the immediate moment and then the present time.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. At the moment, of course, it was our impression before\r\nwe had any other information from any other source at all, when we were\r\njust confronted with the acute emergency, the brief thoughts that ran\r\nthrough our minds were that this was one bullet, that perhaps entered\r\nthrough the front of the neck and then in some peculiar fashion which\r\nwe really had, as I mentioned the other day, to strain to explain to\r\nourselves, had coursed up the front of the vertebra and into the base\r\nof the skull and out the rear of the skull.\r\n\r\nThis would have been a very circuitous route for the bullet to have\r\nmade, so that when we did find later on what the circumstances were\r\nsurrounding the assassination, this was much more readily explainable\r\nto ourselves that the two wounds were made by two separate bullets.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your view or opinion today as to how many\r\nbullets inflicted the injuries of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what would be the reason for your changing your\r\nopinion in that respect?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Oh, just simply the later reports that we heard from\r\nall sources, of all the circumstances surrounding the assassination.\r\nCertainly no further first-hand information came to me and made me\r\nchange my mind in that regard.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, let me ask you to assume a few additional\r\nfacts, and based on a hypothetical situation which I will put to you\r\nand I'll ask you for an opinion.\r\n\r\nAssume, if you will, that President Kennedy was shot on the upper right\r\nposterior thorax just above the upper border of the scapula at a point\r\n14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below a\r\ntip of the right mastoid process, assume further that that wound of\r\nentry was caused by a 6.5-mm. missile shot out of a rifle having a\r\nmuzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per second, being located\r\n160 to 250 feet away from President Kennedy, that the bullet entered on\r\nthe point that I described on the President's back, passed between two\r\nstrap muscles on the posterior aspect of the President's body and moved\r\nthrough the fascial channel without violating the pleura cavity, and\r\nexited in the midline lower third anterior portion of the President's\r\nneck, would the hole which Dr. Perry described to you on the front side\r\nof the President's neck be consistent with the hole which such a bullet\r\nmight make in such a trajectory through the President's body?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what would your reasoning be for thinking that that\r\nwould be a possible hole of exit on those factors as I have outlined\r\nthem to you?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Well, I think my reasoning would be basically that the\r\nmissile was traveling mainly through soft tissue, rather than exploding\r\nfrom a bony chamber and that by the time it reached the neck that it\r\nhad already lost, because of the distance from which it was fired, even\r\nthough the muzzle velocity was as you stated--would have already lost\r\na good deal of its initial velocity and kinetic strength and therefore\r\nwould have perhaps made, particularly, if it were a fragment of the\r\nbullet as bullets do sometimes fragment, could have made a small hole\r\nlike this in exiting. It certainly could have done that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would have happened then to the other portion of the\r\nbullet if it had fragmented?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. It might have been left along, or portions of it along\r\nthe missile track--sometimes will be left scattered up and down this.\r\nOther fragments will maybe scatter in the wound and sometimes there\r\nwill be multiple fragments and sometimes maybe only a small fragment\r\nout of the main bullet, sometimes a bullet will split in half--this is\r\nextremely difficult for me to say just what would happen in a case like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, assuming this situation--that the bullet did not\r\nfragment, because the autopsy report shows no fragmentation, that is,\r\nit cannot show the absence of fragmentation, but we do know that there\r\nwere no bullets left in the body at any point, so that no fragment is\r\nleft in.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. I think even then you could make the statement that\r\nthis wound could have resulted from this type bullet fired through\r\nthis particular mass of soft tissue, losing that much velocity before\r\nit exited from the body. Where you would expect to see this really\r\ngreat hole that is left behind would be, for instance, from a very high\r\nvelocity missile fired at close range with a heavy caliber bullet, such\r\nas a .45 pistol fired at close range, which would make a small entrance\r\nhole, relatively, and particularly if it entered some portion of the\r\nanatomy such as the head, where there was a sudden change in density\r\nfrom the brain to the skull cavity, as it entered. As it left the body,\r\nit would still have a great deal of force behind it and would blow up\r\na large segment of tissue as it exited. But I don't think the bullet\r\nof this nature fired from that distance and going through this large\r\narea of homogenous soft tissue would necessarily make the usual kind\r\nof exit wound like I just described, with a close range high velocity\r\nheavy caliber bullet.\r\n\r\nThis is why it would be difficult to say with certainty as has been\r\nimplied in some newspaper articles that quoted me, that you could tell\r\nfor sure that this was an entrance or an exit wound. I think this was\r\nblown up a good deal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, why wasn't the President's body turned\r\nover?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. The President's body was not turned over because the\r\ninitial things that were done as in all such cases of extreme emergency\r\nare to first establish an airway and second, to stop hemorrhage and\r\nreplace blood, so that these were the initial things that were carried\r\nout immediately without taking time to do a very thorough physical\r\nexamination, which of course would have required that these other\r\nemergency measures not be done immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make any examination of the President's back at\r\nall?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any examination of the President's back made to your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Not here--no.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful in any way to the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No; I think not except again to emphasize perhaps that\r\nsome of our statements to the press about the nature of the wound\r\nmay have been misleading, possibly--probably because of our fault in\r\ntelling it in such a way that they misinterpreted our certainty of\r\nbeing able to tell entrance from exit wounds, which as we say, we\r\ngenerally can make an educated guess about these things but cannot be\r\ncertain about them. I think they attributed too much certainty to us\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you talked to anyone from the Federal Government\r\nabout this matter since I took your deposition last Saturday?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I chat for a moment or two with my showing\r\nyou this translation of \"L' Express\" prior to the time we went on the\r\nrecord here?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the information which you gave to me in response to\r\nmy questions the same that we put on the record here?\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. To the best of my knowledge--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. McClelland.\r\n\r\nDr. McCLELLAND. All right. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. CHARLES RUFUS BAXTER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Charles Rufus Baxter was taken at 11:15 a.m., on\r\nMarch 24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Charles Baxter is present in\r\nresponse to a letter requesting him to appear and give his deposition.\r\nFor the record I shall state that the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy is investigating all facets of\r\nthe shooting, including the medical treatment performed on President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. Baxter has been asked to give a deposition on his participation in\r\nconnection with the care and medical treatment of President Kennedy,\r\nand with that statement of purpose, would you please stand up, Dr.\r\nBaxter, and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the President's\r\nCommission in the course of this deposition proceeding will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name, please?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Charles Rufus Baxter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I am a medical doctor of surgery, general surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline briefly your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. University of Texas--1948 through 1950. Southwestern\r\nMedical School, 1950 through 1954, 1955 straight medicine internship,\r\n1956 medicine residency--internal medicine residency. 1956 through\r\n1958, surgical research at Brooke Army Medical Center, 1958 through\r\n1964--surgical residency, and 1964 through the present--this is 1964, I\r\ngot out of the Army--in 1958, 1958 through 1962--surgery residency, and\r\n1962 until now, assistant professor of surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you board certified, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what boards have you passed?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. The American Board of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year were you so certified?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your specific title at the medical school?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Assistant professor of surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to aid in the treatment of President\r\nKennedy at Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you outline briefly the circumstances surrounding\r\nyour being called to render such assistance?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I was conducting the student health service in the hours\r\nof 12 to 1 and was contacted there by the supervisor of the emergency\r\nroom, who told me that the President was on the way to the emergency\r\nroom, having been shot.\r\n\r\nI went on a dead run to the emergency room as fast as I could and it\r\ntook me about 3 or 4 minutes to get there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what time did you arrive at the emergency\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I think it was 12:40--thereabouts.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Dr. Carrico and Dr. Jones and Dr. Jenkins--several nurses.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify the nurses?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes; Mrs. Nelson--and who else? There were two or three\r\nothers whose names--Miss Henchliffe was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Miss Bowron?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Who?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Miss Bowron there?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes; I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any other nurses there?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. One or two more, but I'm not sure of their names.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any other doctors who were there at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Oh, let's see--I'm not sure whether the others came before\r\nor after I did. There was Crenshaw, Peters, and Kemp Clark, Dr. Bashour\r\nfinally came. I believe Jackie Hunt--yes--she was, I believe she was\r\nthe anesthesiologist who came.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Dr. Don Curtis there?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I'm not sure--I just don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you arrived, what did you observe as to the condition\r\nof the President?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. He was very obviously in extremis. There was a large gaping\r\nwound in the skull which was covered at that time with blood, and its\r\nextent was not immediately determined. His eyes were bulging, the\r\npupils were fixed and dilated and deviated outward, both pupils were\r\ndeviated laterally. At that time his breathing was being assisted so\r\nthat whether he was breathing on his own or not, I couldn't determine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what way was his breathing being assisted?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. With an anesthesia machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you continue to describe what you observed as to his\r\ncondition?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. There were no pulses that I could feel present. The\r\nanesthesiologist told me that he did still have a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who is that who said that to you?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Well, I believe this was Carrico who said that his heart\r\nwas still beating. There was present at the time two intravenous\r\ncatheters in place with fluids running. We were informed at that\r\ntime--well, having looked over the rest of the body, the only other\r\nwound was in his neck, that we saw.\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico said that he had observed a tracheal laceration. At that\r\nmoment Dr. Jones, I believe, was placing in a left anterior chest\r\ntube because of this information. We proceeded at that time with a\r\ntracheotomy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who performed the tracheotomy?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Dr. Perry and myself, with the assistance of Dr.\r\nMcClelland, and I believe that's all--there may have been one more\r\nperson that held the retractor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else, if anything, did you do for President Kennedy\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. During the tracheotomy, I helped with the insertion of\r\na right anterior chest tube, and then helped Dr. Perry complete the\r\ntracheotomy. At that point none of us could hear a heartbeat present.\r\nApparently this had ceased during the tracheotomy and the chest tube\r\nplacement.\r\n\r\nWe then gave him or Dr. Perry and Dr. Clark alternated giving him\r\nclosed chest cardiac massage only until we could get a cardioscope\r\nhooked up to tell us if there were any detectible heartbeat\r\nelectrically present, at least, and there was none, and we discussed at\r\nthat moment whether we should open the chest to attempt to revive him,\r\nwhile the closed chest massage was going on, and we had an opportunity\r\nto look at his head wound then and saw that the damage was beyond hope,\r\nthat is, in a word--literally the right side of his head had been blown\r\noff. With this and the observation that the cerebellum was present--a\r\nlarge quantity of brain was present on the cart, well--we felt that\r\nsuch an additional heroic attempt was not warranted, and we did not\r\npronounce him dead but ceased our efforts, and awaited the priest and\r\nlast rites before we pronounced him dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the priest then arrive to perform the last rites?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time was he pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. As I recall, it was 1:08, I'm not sure, it may have been\r\nthat that was Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But it was approximately 1 o'clock? Then, could the time\r\nof death be fixed with any precision?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I don't think so--the time elapsing in all of this\r\nresuscitation and the time the heart actually ceased, I don't think one\r\ncould be very sure of it. It was sometime between a quarter to 1 and 1\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the efforts which were made\r\nto save the life of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Only with the exception, I think, of the fluids that were\r\nadministered. He was given hydrocortisone because of his previous\r\nmedical condition. He was given no negative blood because the blood\r\nloss was rather fierce and, I believe that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other doctors arrived during the course of the\r\ntreatment, in addition to those whom you have already mentioned?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I don't recall--I know that there were more doctors present\r\nin the room, but their names, I'm not sure of. The reason I'm not sure\r\nis because we had some of the same crew and a different crew on the\r\nGovernor and on Oswald, and I'm afraid that I've gotten them mixed up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you describe in as much particularity as you can\r\nthe nature of the head wound?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. The only wound that I actually saw--Dr. Clark examined this\r\nabove the manubrium of the sternum, the sternal notch. This wound was\r\nin temporal parietal plate of bone laid outward to the side and there\r\nwas a large area, oh, I would say 6 by 8 or 10 cm. of lacerated brain\r\noozing from this wound, part of which was on the table and made a\r\nrather massive blood loss mixed with it and around it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any bullet hole below that large opening at\r\nthe top of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No; I personally did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe with as much particularity as you can\r\nthe wound which you noticed on the President's neck?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. The wound on the neck was approximately an inch and a half\r\nabove the manubrium of the sternum, the sternal notch. This wound was\r\nin my estimation, 4 to 5 mm. in widest diameter and was a spherical\r\nwound. The edges of it--the size of the wound is measured by the hole\r\nplus the damaged skin around the area, so that it was a very small\r\nwound. And, it was directly in the midline. Now, this wound was excised\r\nin the performance of the tracheotomy and on the entry into the deeper\r\ntissues of the neck, there was considerable contusion of the muscles of\r\nthe anterior neck and a moderate amount of bleeding around the trachea.\r\nThe trachea was deviated slightly, I believe, to the left.\r\n\r\nOur tracheotomy incision was made in the second tracheal ring which\r\nwas immediately above the area of damage--where we thought the damaged\r\narea of the trachea was, which we did not dissect out, but once the\r\nendrotracheal tube was placed, the tracheotomy tube was placed into\r\nthe trachea, it was below this tear in the trachea, and gave us good\r\ncontrol or perfect control of respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the characteristics of the wound on the neck\r\nsufficient to enable you to form an opinion with reasonable medical\r\ncertainty as to what was the cause of the hole?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Well, the wound was, I think, compatible with a gunshot\r\nwound. It did not appear to be a jagged wound such as one would expect\r\nwith a very high velocity rifle bullet. We could not determine, or did\r\nnot determine at that time whether this represented an entry or an\r\nexit wound. Judging from the caliber of the rifle that we later found\r\nor become acquainted with, this would more resemble a wound of entry.\r\nHowever, due to the density of the tissues of the neck and depending\r\nupon what a bullet of such caliber would pass through, the tissues that\r\nit would pass through on the way to the neck, I think that the wound\r\ncould well represent either exit or entry wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming some factors in addition to those which you\r\npersonally observed, Dr. Baxter, what would your opinion be if these\r\nadditional facts were present: First, the President had a bullet wound\r\nof entry on the right posterior thorax just above the upper border\r\nof the scapula with the wound measuring 7 by 4 mm. in oval shape,\r\nbeing 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm.\r\nbelow the tip of the right mastoid process--assume this is the set of\r\nfacts, that the wound just described was caused by a 6.5 mm. bullet\r\nshot from approximately 160 to 250 feet away from the President, from\r\na weapon having a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per\r\nsecond, assuming as a third factor that the bullet passed through the\r\nPresident's body, going in between the strap muscles of the shoulder\r\nwithout violating the pleura space and exited at a point in the midline\r\nof the neck, would the hole which you saw on the President's throat be\r\nconsistent with an exit point, assuming the factors which I have just\r\ngiven to you?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Although it would be unusual for a high velocity missile of\r\nthis type to cause a wound as you have described, the passage through\r\ntissue planes of this density could have well resulted in the sequence\r\nwhich you outline; namely, that the anterior wound does represent a\r\nwound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would be the considerations which, in your mind,\r\nwould make it, as you characterized it, unlikely?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. It would be unlikely because the damage that the bullet\r\nwould create would be--first its speed would create a shock wave which\r\nwould damage a larger number of tissues, as in its path, it would tend\r\nto strike, or usually would strike, tissues of greater density than\r\nthis particular missile did and would then begin to tumble and would\r\ncreate larger jagged--the further it went, the more jagged would be\r\nthe damage that it created; so that ordinarily there would have been a\r\nrather large wound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But relating the situation as I hypothesized it for you?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Then it is perfectly understandable that this wound of exit\r\nwas not of any greater magnitude than it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Baxter, is there a channel through which the bullet\r\ncould have passed in the general direction which I have described to\r\nyou where there would be very few tissues and virtually no tissues of\r\ngreat density?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes; passing through the fascial plane which you have\r\ndescribed, it could well not have these things happen to it, so that it\r\nwould pass directly through--almost as if passing through a sheet of\r\npaper and the wound of exit would be no larger than the wound we saw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would the situation there be as to the shock wave\r\nwhich you have heretofore described?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. There would be a large amount of tissue damage which is not\r\nordinarily seen immediately after a bullet has passed through. This is\r\ndamage that is recognized several days later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What causes the shock waves there, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. This is just the velocity imparting pressure to surrounding\r\ntissues which damages them. It does not show, however, in the early\r\ncourse after a missile has passed through.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, would the shock waves have any effect upon the size,\r\nand nature of the hole of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And if the bullet passed through the fascial plane without\r\nstriking tissues of great density, would it have a tendency to tumble\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No, it would not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What has your experience been, if any, Doctor, with\r\ngunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. For the past 6 years--we admit and treat, I would estimate,\r\naround 500 gunshot wounds per year--thereabouts.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any formal training in gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Only that I received in the Army, with demonstration of\r\nvarious velocities and that type missile wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was President Kennedy lying when you first saw him,\r\nDr. Baxter?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. On the cart, on the emergency cart in trauma room 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he ever taken off of that cart from the time you first\r\nsaw him until the time he was pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he ever turned over?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would your examination have been conducted in any\r\ndifferent way had this particular victim not been the President of the\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. I think--yes--in that we would have, particularly,\r\npostmortem examined the body much more carefully than we did. We would\r\ncertainly have undressed him completely and determined all of the\r\ndirection of the wounds at the time. This did not seem feasible under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why was it not feasible under the circumstances?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room, there was a large number of\r\npeople in the room by that time--Secret Service Agents, the priests and\r\nso on. As soon as the President was pronounced dead, the Secret Service\r\nmore or less--well, requested that we clear the room and leave them\r\nwith the President's body, which was done. Everything that the Secret\r\nService wished was carried out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was that?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Everything that the Secret Service asked us to do, we did,\r\nas rapidly as possible and this was one of their requests.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I must say that the emotional condition of all of us at\r\nthat time was such that probably we would not--we didn't feel that we\r\nshould do any more, since we were certain that autopsy would take care\r\nof all that we were going to miss.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the emotional situation have any effect in your\r\nprofessional opinion on the quality of the medical care which was\r\nrendered to the President?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No; none at all. We, I think, everyone present in the room\r\nwas certainly emotionally involved in the care of the President, but in\r\nno instance did I see less than the most meticulous and best judgment\r\nused in the care of the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death, Dr.\r\nBaxter?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Gunshot wound to the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have an opinion as to whether or not President\r\nKennedy would have survived the gunshot wound which you observed in the\r\nneck?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. We saw no evidence that it had struck anything in the neck\r\nthat would not be well taken care of by simply--by the tracheotomy and\r\nchest tubes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you find any bullets in the President's body?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No, we did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any fragments of bullets in the President's body?\r\n\r\nMr. BAXTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Baxter, I now show you Commission Exhibit 392, which\r\nhas been heretofore identified in Commission Proceedings as the report\r\nfrom Parkland Memorial Hospital, and I now call your attention to a\r\npage which purports to bear your signature, and a written report which\r\nyou rendered under date of November 22, 1963. I ask you, first of all,\r\nif that is your signature?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, if this is the report which you submitted?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any other writings or notes of any sort\r\nconcerning your care of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you read into the record, Dr. Baxter, the contents of\r\nyour report, because it is a little hard to read in spots?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. \"I was contacted at approximately 12:40 that the\r\nPresident was on the way to the Emergency Room, having been shot. On\r\narrival there, I found an endotracheal tube in place with assisted\r\nrespirations, a left chest tube being inserted, and cutdowns going in\r\none leg and in the left arm.\r\n\r\nThe President had a wound in the midline of the neck. On first\r\nobservation of the remaining wounds, the temporal and parietal bones\r\nwere missing and the brain was lying on the table with extensive\r\nlacerations and contusions. The pupils were fixed and deviated\r\nlaterally and dilated. No pulse was detectable, respirations were (as\r\nnoted) being supplemented. A tracheotomy was performed by Dr. Perry and\r\nI and a chest tube inserted into the right chest (second interspace\r\nanteriorly). Meanwhile, 2 pints of O negative blood was administered\r\nby pump without response. When all of these measures were complete, no\r\nheartbeat could be detected, closed chest massage was performed until a\r\ncardioscope could be attached, which revealed no cardiac activity was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nDue to the extensive and irreparable brain damage which was detected,\r\nno further attempt to resuscitate the heart was made.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that bears your signature?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Charles R. Baxter, M.D., assistant professor of surgery,\r\nSouthwestern Medical School, University of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Baxter, has any representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment ever talked to you about this matter prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. The only person was a Secret Service Agent\r\nabout--approximately three weeks ago who asked me if I had any\r\nadditional written comments anywhere or had made any writings on the\r\nmedical treatment of the President, and the answer was \"No.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, prior to the time that the court reporter started to\r\ntranscribe my questions and your answers, did you and I briefly discuss\r\nthis deposition proceeding, its purpose and the questions which I would\r\nask you?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the answers given on the record here the same as\r\nyou gave me in our brief conversation before the transcription was\r\nstarted?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful in any way to the work of the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Baxter.\r\n\r\nDr. BAXTER. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. MARION THOMAS JENKINS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Marion Thomas Jenkins was taken at 5:30 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. M. T. Jenkins has appeared\r\nin response to a letter request in connection with the inquiry of the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, to\r\ntestify concerning his observations and medical treatment performed\r\nby him on President Kennedy, and with this preliminary statement of\r\npurpose, would you stand up, please, Dr. Jenkins, and raise your right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the President's\r\nCommission in this deposition proceeding, will be the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Marion Thomas Jenkins.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, please?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I'm a physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you licensed by the State of Texas to practice\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your specialty, Dr. Jenkins?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Anesthesiology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline your educational background for me,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I am a graduate of the University of Texas in 1937. I have\r\na B.A. degree and an M.D. degree from the University of Texas Medical\r\nBranch at Galveston in 1940, rotating internship at the University of\r\nKansas Hospital, Kansas City, Kans., 1940-41; Assistant Residency in\r\nInternal Medicine, John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Tex., 1941-42;\r\nactive duty in the U.S. Navy as a Medical Officer, 1942 to 1946;\r\nResident in Surgery--Parkland Hospital, Dallas, 1946-47; Resident in\r\nanesthesiology in the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, 1947-48;\r\nand Director of the Department of Anesthesiology, Parkland Hospital and\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, 1948 to the present; Professor and Chairman\r\nof the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas, Southwestern\r\nMedical School--since 1951. Diplomate--other certification, do you want\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, what Boards are you certified?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I am a Diplomate of the American Board of Anesthesiology\r\nand also fellow of the American College of Anesthesiologists.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year were you certified by the American Board?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. 1952.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to assist in the treatment of\r\nPresident Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding\r\nyour being called into that case?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, I was in the dining room with other members of the\r\nhospital staff when we heard the Chief of Surgery, Dr. Tom Shires,\r\nbeing paged \"Stat.\" This is a rather unusual call, for the Chief of any\r\nservice to be called \"Stat\" as this is the emergency call.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What does that mean, \"Stat\"?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. \"Stat\" means emergency, that's just a code word that has\r\nbeen used for years in medical terms. He was paged twice this way, and\r\none of the surgical residents, Dr. Ronald Jones, answered the phone,\r\nthinking something bad must be up and that he would call the Chief of\r\nSurgery. I was sitting near the telephone and Dr. Jones immediately\r\ncame back by with a very anguished look and the color was drained from\r\nhis face--I'm sure I had that impression, and he said, \"The President\r\nhas been shot and is on his way to the hospital.\" At the same time we\r\nheard the sirens of the ambulance as they turned into the driveway\r\nfrom Harry Hines into the hospital drive, and it was obvious that this\r\nwas the car coming in because the ambulance sirens usually stop in the\r\nstreet, but these came on clear to the building.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's Harry Hines Boulevard right in front of the\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes; I ran up the stairs to the Anesthesia Department,\r\nthat's on the second floor--one floor above the dining room, where I\r\nwas, and notified two members of the Department, the first two I saw,\r\nmy Chief Associate, Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr., and Dr. Jackie Hunt, that\r\nthe President had been shot and was being brought to the emergency room\r\nand for them to bring all the resuscitative equipment we have including\r\nan anesthesia machine. The emergency room is set up well, but we are\r\nused to working with our own equipment and I asked them to bring it\r\ndown and I ran down the back stairs, two flights down, and I arrived in\r\nthe emergency room just after or right behind him being wheeled in, I\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time did you arrive at the emergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Oh, this was around 12:30-12:35 to 12:40. I shouldn't be\r\nindefinite about this--in our own specialty practice, we watch the\r\nclock closely, and there are many things we have to keep up with, but I\r\ndidn't get that time exactly, I'll admit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present at the time of your arrival in the\r\nemergency room, if anyone?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. The hallway was loaded with people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What medical personnel were in attendance?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Including Mrs. Kennedy, I recognized, and Secret Service\r\nmen, I didn't know whether to block the way or get out of it, as it\r\nturned out. Dr. James Carrico and Dr. Dulany--Dick Dulany, I guess you\r\nhave his name, and several nurses were in the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you identify the nurses?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, not really. I could identify them only having later\r\nlooked around and identified from my own record that I have, the names\r\nof all who were there later. Now, whether they are the same ones when I\r\nfirst went there, I don't know. I have all the names in my report, it\r\nseemed to me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you now identify all of the nurses from your later\r\nobservations of them?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, I can identify who was in there at the close of the\r\nprocedure, that is, the doctors, as well as those who were helping.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine, would you do that for us, please?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. These included a Mrs. or Miss Patricia Hutton and Miss\r\nDiana Bowron, B-o-w-r-o-n (spelling), and a Miss Henchliffe--I don't\r\nknow her first name, but I do know it is Henchliffe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Margaret?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Margaret--certainly. Those three--there were probably some\r\nstudent nurses too, whom I didn't recognize. Shall I continue?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, please. Have you now covered all the people you\r\nrecollect as being in the room?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, as I came into the room, I saw only\r\nthe--actually--you know, in the haste of the coming of the President,\r\ntwo doctors whom I recognized, and there were other people and I have\r\nidentified all I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's condition when\r\nyou arrived in the emergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, I was aware of what he was in an agonal state. This\r\nis not a too unfamiliar state that we see in the Service, as much\r\ntrauma as we see, that is, he had the agonal respiratory gasp made\r\nup of jerking movements of the mylohyoid group of muscles. These are\r\nreferred to sometimes as chin jerk, tracheal tug or agonal muscles\r\nof respiration. He had this characteristic of respiration. His eyes\r\nwere opened and somewhat exophthalmic and color was greatly suffused,\r\ncyanotic--a purplish cyanosis.\r\n\r\nStill, we have patients in the state, as far as cyanosis and agonal\r\ntype respiration, who are resuscitatable. Of course, you don't stop at\r\nthis time and think, \"Well, this is a hopeless circumstance,\"--because\r\none in this state can often be resusciated--this represents the\r\nactivities prior to one's demise sometimes, and if it can be stopped,\r\nsuch as the patient is oxygenated again and circulation reinstituted,\r\nhe can be saved.\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico had just introduced an endotracheal tube, I'm very proud\r\nof him for this because it's not as easy as it sounds. At times and\r\nunder the circumstances--it was harder--he had just completed a 3-month\r\nrotation on the anesthesiology service, and I thought this represented\r\ngood background training for a smart individual, and he told me he had\r\na cuff on the endotracheal tube and he introduced it below the wound.\r\n\r\nThe reason I said this, of course, this is a reflex--there is a tube,\r\nthe endotracheal tube, if it is pushed down a little too far it can go\r\ninto the right main stem of the bronchus impairing respiration from\r\nboth lungs, or both chests.\r\n\r\nThere was in the room an intermittent positive pressure breathing\r\napparatus, which can be used to respire for a patient. As I connected\r\nthis up, however, Dr. Carrico and I connected it up to give oxygen\r\nby artificial respiration, Dr. Giesecke and Dr. Hunt arrived on the\r\nscene with the anesthesia machine and I connected it up instead with\r\nsomething I am more familiar with--not for anesthesia, I must insist on\r\nthat--it was for the oxygenation, the ability to control ventilation\r\nwith 100 percent oxygen.\r\n\r\nAs I came in there, other people came in also. This is my recollection.\r\nNow, by this time I was in familiar surroundings, despite the anguish\r\nof the circumstance.\r\n\r\nDespite the unusual circumstance, in terms of the distinguished\r\npersonage who was the patient, I think the people who had gathered\r\nor who had congregated were so accustomed to doing resuscitative\r\nprocedures of this nature that they knew where to fit into the\r\nresuscitation team without having a preconceived or predirected plan,\r\nbecause, as obviously--some people were doing things not necessarily in\r\ntheir specialty, but there was the opening and there was the necessity\r\nfor this being done.\r\n\r\nThere were three others who came in as I did who recognized at once the\r\nneck wound, in fact, where the wound was, would indicate that we would\r\nhave serious pulmonary problems unless a tracheotomy tube was put in.\r\nThis is one way of avoiding pushing air out through a fractured trachea\r\nand down into each chest cavity, which would cause a pneumothorax or\r\na collapse of the lungs. These were doctors Malcolm Perry, Charley\r\nBaxter, and Robert McClelland, who with Dr. Carrico's help, I believe,\r\nstarted the tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Drs. Kemp Clark and Paul Peters came in, and Dr.\r\nPeters because of the appearance of the right chest, the obvious\r\nphysical characteristics of a pneumothorax, put in a closed chest\r\ndrainage--chest tube. Because I felt no peripheral pulse and was not\r\naware of any pulse, I reported this to Dr. Clark and he started closed\r\nchest cardiac massage.\r\n\r\nThere were other people--one which started an I.V. in a cutdown in\r\nthe right leg and one a cutdown in the left arm. Two of my department\r\nconnected up the cardioscope, in which we had electrical silence on\r\nthe cardioscope as Dr. Clark started closed chest massage. That's the\r\nsequence of events as I reconstructed them that day and dictated them\r\non my report, which you have here, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Speaking of your report, Dr. Jenkins, permit me to show\r\nyou a group of papers heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 392 which has also been identified by Mr. Price, the hospital\r\nAdministrator, as being photostatic copies of original reports in his\r\npossession and controlled as Custodian of Records, and I show you what\r\npurports to be a report from you to Mr. Price, dated November 22, 1963,\r\nand ask you if in fact this 2-page report was submitted by you to Mr.\r\nPrice?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going back to the wound which you observed in the\r\nneck, did you see that wound before the tracheotomy was performed?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes; I did, because I was just connecting up the\r\nendotracheal tube to the machine at the time and that's when Dr.\r\nCarrico said there was a wound in the neck and I looked at it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe that wound as specifically as you can?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, I'm afraid my description of it would not be as\r\naccurate, of course, as that of the surgeons who were doing the\r\ntracheotomy, because my look was a quick look before connecting up\r\nthe endotracheal tube to the apparatus to help in ventilation and\r\nrespiration for the patient, and I was aware later in the day, as I\r\nshould have put it in the report, that I thought this was a wound\r\nof exit because it was not a clean wound, and by \"clean\" clearly\r\ndemarcated, round, punctate wound which is the usual wound of an\r\nentrance wound, made by a missile and at some speed. Of course,\r\nentrance wounds with a lobbing type missile, can make a jagged wound\r\nalso, but I was of the impression and I recognized I had the impression\r\nit was an exit wound. However, my mental appreciation for a wound--for\r\nthe wound in the neck, I believe, was sort of--was overshadowed by\r\nrecognition of the wound in the scalp and skull plate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described the wound in the neck as\r\nspecifically as you can at this moment?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you now describe the wound which you observed in\r\nthe head?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Almost by the time I was--had the time to pay more\r\nattention to the wound in the head, all of these other activities were\r\nunder way. I was busy connecting up an apparatus to respire for the\r\npatient, exerting manual pressure on the breathing bag or anesthesia\r\napparatus, trying to feel for a pulse in the neck, and then reaching up\r\nand feeling for one in the temporal area, seeing about connecting the\r\ncardioscope or directing its being connected, and then turned attention\r\nto the wound in the head.\r\n\r\nNow, Dr. Clark had begun closed chest cardiac massage at this time\r\nand I was aware of the magnitude of the wound, because with each\r\ncompression of the chest, there was a great rush of blood from the\r\nskull wound. Part of the brain was herniated; I really think part of\r\nthe cerebellum, as I recognized it, was herniated from the wound; there\r\nwas part of the brain tissue, broken fragments of the brain tissue on\r\nthe drapes of the cart on which the President lay.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wounds immediately below the massive\r\nloss of skull which you have described?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. On the right side?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. No--I don't know whether this is right or not, but I\r\nthought there was a wound on the left temporal area, right in the\r\nhairline and right above the zygomatic process.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The autopsy report discloses no such development, Dr.\r\nJenkins.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, I was feeling for--I was palpating here for a pulse\r\nto see whether the closed chest cardiac massage was effective or not\r\nand this probably was some blood that had come from the other point and\r\nso I thought there was a wound there also.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time was President Kennedy\r\npronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, this was pronounced, we know the exact time as 1300,\r\naccording to my watch, at least, at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Cerebral injury--brain injury.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was President Kennedy ever turned over during the course\r\nof this treatment at Parkland?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why was he not turned over, Dr. Jenkins?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Oh, I think this was beyond our prerogative completely. I\r\nthink as we pronounced the President dead, those in attendance who were\r\nthere just sort of melted away, well, I guess \"melted\" is the wrong\r\nword, but we felt like we were intruders and left. I'm sure that this\r\nwas considerably beyond our prerogative, and the facts were we knew he\r\nhad a fatal wound, and I think my own personal feeling was that this\r\nwas--would have been meddlesome on anybody's part after death to have\r\ndone any further search.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any examination of his back made before death, to your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. No, no; I'm sure there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he remain on the stretcher cart at all times while he\r\nwas being cared for?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nCan I say something that isn't in the report here, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; let's go off the record a minute.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr.\r\nJenkins.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that we are back on the record and\r\nDr. Jenkins has made an interesting observation about the time of the\r\ndeclaration of death, and I will ask you, Dr. Jenkins, for you to\r\nrepeat for the record what you have just said off the record.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. As the resuscitative maneuvers were begun, such as\r\n\"chest cardiac massage,\" there was with each compression of the\r\nsternum, a gush of blood from the skull wound, which indicated there\r\nwas massive vascular damage in the skull and the brain, as well as\r\nbrain tissue damage, and we recognized by this time that the patient\r\nwas beyond the point of resuscitation, that he was in fact dead, and\r\nthis was substantiated by getting a silent electrical pattern on the\r\nelectrocardiogram, the cardioscope that was connected up.\r\n\r\nHowever, for a period of minutes, but I can't now define exactly, since\r\nI didn't put this in a report, after we knew he was dead, we continued\r\nattempted resuscitative maneuvers.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw the two priests who arrived in the corridor outside the\r\nemergency room where this was taking place, I went to the door and\r\nasked one of those--after turning over my ventilation, my respiration\r\njob to another one of my department--and asked him what is the proper\r\ntime to declare one dead. That is, I am not a Catholic and I was not\r\nsure of the time for the last rites. As I remember now, he said, \"The\r\ntime that the soul leaves the body--is not at exactly the time that\r\nmedical testimony might say that death was declared.\" There would be\r\na period of time and so if we wished to declare him dead at that time\r\nthey would still have the final rites.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they then have the final rites after the time he was\r\ndeclared dead medically?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, just a minute now--I suspect that was hazy to me\r\nthat day--I'm not sure, it's still hazy. This was a very personal--on\r\nthe part of the very anguished occasion, and Mrs. Kennedy had come back\r\ninto the room and most of the people were beginning to leave because\r\nthey felt like this was such a grief stricken and private affair that\r\nthey should not be there. It was real intrusion even after they put\r\nforth such efforts at resuscitation and I'm not sure now whether the\r\npriests came in while I was still doing the resuscitative procedure,\r\nrespiration at least, and while Dr. Clark was still doing the other. My\r\nmemory is that we had stopped. I was still present, however, and that's\r\nthe reason I'm not clear, because I hadn't left the room and I was\r\nstill there as the rites were performed and a prayer was said.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Jenkins, would your observation of the wound and your\r\ncharacterization of it as an exit hole be consistent with a set of\r\nfacts which I will ask you to assume for purposes of giving me your\r\nview or opinion.\r\n\r\nAssume, first of all, if you will, that President Kennedy had a wound\r\non the upper right posterior thorax just above the upper border of\r\nthe scapula, measuring 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion\r\nprocess and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process, and\r\nthat the missile was a 6.5 mm. jacketed bullet fired from a weapon\r\nhaving a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per second and\r\napproximately 160 to 250 feet from the President, and that after\r\nentering the President's body at the point indicated, the missile\r\ntraveled between two strap muscles and through a fascia plane without\r\nviolating the pleura cavity, and then struck the right side of the\r\ntrachea and exited through the throat, would the throat wound which\r\nyou observed be consistent with such a wound inflicted in the manner I\r\nhave just described?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. As far as I know, it wouldn't be inconsistent with it, Mr.\r\nSpecter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What has your experience been with gunshot wounds, that\r\nis, to what extent have you had experience with such wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, having been Chief of the Anesthesia Service here for\r\nthis 16 years, we have a rather large trauma emergency service, and so\r\nI see gunshot wounds many times a week. I'm afraid I couldn't hazard\r\na guess at the moment as to how many we see a year, and I'm afraid\r\nprobably if I knew, I would not like to admit to this number, but I\r\ndo go further in saying that my main interest is not in the tracks of\r\nthe wounds. My main interest is what physiological changes that they\r\nhave caused to the patient that I am to anesthetize or a member of the\r\ndepartment is to anesthetize, what has happened to the cardiovascular\r\nsystem, respiratory, and neurological, and so I am aware of the wounds\r\nof entrance and exit only by a peripheral part of my knowledge and\r\nactivities during the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any formal training in ballistics or in\r\nexit wounds or entrance wounds--bullet wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. No, I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment at any time prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Oh, there was a man whose name I don't remember now, who\r\nshowed what looked like the proper credentials from the FBI, who came\r\nto ask only whether the report I had submitted to Mr. Price for the\r\nhospital record or for Mr. Price's record constituted all the reports I\r\nhad. That's the only time, and that was the extent of our conversation,\r\nI think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the only written record you have of your\r\nparticipation in the treatment of the President?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Oh, I submitted one to the Dean of the Medical School,\r\nessentially the same, and a very little more. I don't think you have\r\nthat. I don't know whether you want it or not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, I would like to see it.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. It is essentially the same report--however--can I ask you\r\nsomething off of the record here?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sure.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Jenkins, off\r\nthe record.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The record will show that we have been off the record on a\r\ncouple of matters which I am going to now put on the record, but I will\r\nask the court reporter to identify this as Dr. Jenkins' Exhibit No. 36.\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the Reporter as Dr. Jenkins' Exhibit\r\nNo. 36, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I will ask you, Dr. Jenkins, for the record to identify\r\nthis as a report which you submitted to Dean Gill.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes, it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is this in conjunction with the report you submitted\r\nto Mr. Price--do these reports constitute all the writings you have on\r\nyour participation in the treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. One of the comments we were just discussing off the\r\nrecord--I would like to put on the record, Dr. Jenkins, is the question\r\nas to whether or not the wound in the neck would have been fatal in\r\nyour opinion, absent the head wound. What would your view of that be?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Well, from my knowledge of the wound in the neck, this\r\nwould not have been fatal, except for one thing, and that is--you have\r\nnot told me whether the wound with its point of entrance and point of\r\nexit had contacted the vertebral column in its course?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It did not.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. In that case I would not expect this wound to have been\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your view, Dr. Jenkins, as to whether the wounds\r\nwhich you observed were caused by one or two bullets?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I felt quite sure at the time that there must have been\r\ntwo bullets--two missiles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, Dr. Jenkins, what was your reason for that?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Because the wound with the exploded area of the scalp, as\r\nI interpreted it being exploded, I would interpret it being a wound of\r\nexit, and the appearance of the wound in the neck, and I also thought\r\nit was a wound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever changed any of your original opinions in\r\nconnection with the wounds received by President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I guess so. The first day I had thought because of his\r\npneumothorax, that his wound must have gone--that the one bullet must\r\nhave traversed his pleura, must have gotten into his lung cavity, his\r\nchest cavity, I mean, and from what you say now, I know it did not go\r\nthat way. I thought it did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from that opinion, now, have any of your other\r\nopinions about the nature of his wounds or the sources of the wounds\r\nbeen changed in any way?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. No; one other. I asked you a little bit ago if there was a\r\nwound in the left temporal area, right above the zygomatic bone in the\r\nhairline, because there was blood there and I thought there might have\r\nbeen a wound there (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the left temporal area?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes; the left temporal, which could have been a point of\r\nentrance and exit here (indicating), but you have answered that for me.\r\nThis was my only other question about it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, that those two points are the only ones on which your\r\nopinions have been changed since the views you originally formulated?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes, I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the President's injuries?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes, I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the conversation you had with that Secret Service\r\nAgent the only time you were interviewed by anyone from the Federal\r\nGovernment prior to today about this subject?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. As far as I remember--I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you say that was the only time you were interviewed?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes, as far as I remember--I have had no formal\r\ninterviews. I have been asked--there have been some people calling on\r\nthe phone. As you know, there were many calls from various sources\r\nall over the country after that, wanting to know whether we had done\r\nthis method of treatment or some other method and what principles we\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But the only one you can identify as being from the\r\nFederal Government is the one you have already related from the Secret\r\nService?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I have a very brief conversation before\r\nthe deposition started today, when you gave me some of your views which\r\nyou expounded and expanded upon during the course of the deposition on\r\nthe record?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there anything which you think of to add that\r\nyou believe would be of some assistance or any assistance to the\r\nPresident's Commission in its inquiry?\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. I believe not, Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Jenkins.\r\n\r\nDr. JENKINS. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. RONALD COY JONES\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Ronald Coy Jones was taken at 10:20 a.m., on March\r\n24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show at this point that Dr. Ronald Jones\r\nhas arrived in response to a letter of request to give his deposition\r\nfor the President's Commission on the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. Jones, the purpose of the President's Commission is to investigate\r\nall the facts relating to the shooting and subsequent medical treatment\r\nof President Kennedy and we have asked you to appear to testify\r\nconcerning your knowledge of that treatment.\r\n\r\nWith that statement of purpose, will you stand up and raise your\r\nright hand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission during the course of this deposition proceeding\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Ronald Coy Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. General Surgery--resident physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline briefly your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I graduated--I went to undergraduate school at the\r\nUniversity of Arkansas from 1950 to 1953, in pre-med. From 1953 through\r\n1957, I went to medical school and graduated from the University of\r\nTennessee in Memphis, and in 1957 through 1958 I took an internship in\r\nLos Angeles County General Hospital.\r\n\r\nFrom there I went to the University of Oklahoma and took a 2-year\r\ngeneral practice residency, 1 year, the first year, entailing a year of\r\ninternal medicine and its subspecialties, and a second year of surgery\r\nand its subspecialties, which was approved by the American Board of\r\nSurgeons for 1 year of surgical training, and from 1960 until the\r\npresent time I have taken an additional 4 years of general surgery at\r\nParkland, and have served as Chief Resident of Surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to aid in the medical treatment of\r\nPresident Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding\r\nyour being called into the case?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I was eating lunch with Dr. Perry and I heard the operator\r\npage Dr. Tom Shires of the staff on two occasions, and the second time\r\nI answered the phone and the operator told me that the President had\r\nbeen shot and was being brought to the emergency room.\r\n\r\nI turned around and immediately notified Miss Audrey Bell, who is\r\nthe operating room supervisor so that any arrangements could be made\r\nfor immediate surgery, and Dr. M. T. Jenkins, who is the Chief of\r\nthe Anesthesiology Department. From there I went across the room and\r\nnotified Dr. Perry of the shooting and we both went together to the\r\nemergency room, and it was at that time we arrived shortly after the\r\nPresident had been brought in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your best estimate as to the time you arrived at\r\nthe emergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. It was, I would say, around 23 or 25 minutes until 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present, if anyone, at the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Dr. James Carrico, and possibly Dr. Richard Dulany, and I'm\r\nnot sure that he was there or was there for just a few minutes after we\r\narrived. I do recall seeing him there as one of the first ones.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was any nurse present at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. The head nurse in the emergency room was present and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know her name?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. It's left my mind right now--I know her.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could that be Miss Henchliffe?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. She was there, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Bowron?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No--just the--\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Nelson?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Nelson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was anyone else present then, other than those whom you\r\nhave already mentioned at the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. There were three nurses there--Mrs. Nelson, Miss Henchliffe\r\nand Miss Bowron.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were any other doctors present when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Dr. Carrico was the only doctor other than possibly Dr.\r\nDulany, and I do know Dr. Carrico was there when I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Dr. Don Curtis there when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who arrived with you, if you recall?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Dr. Perry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe the President's condition to be\r\nupon your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. He appeared to be terminal, if not already expired, and\r\nDr. Carrico said that he had seen some attempted respirations, agonal\r\nrespirations, and with that history, we went ahead with emergency\r\nmeasures to try to restore the airway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"attempted agonal respiration,\" do you mean\r\nan effort by the President?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or, an effort by someone else to induce respiration?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No, these apparently were as Dr. Carrico saw the President\r\nwas attempting to respire on his own, however, I did not personally see\r\nthis in the brief seconds that I stood there before I went ahead and\r\nstarted work.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the lay definition for agonal respiration?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. These are the respirations that are somewhat of a strain,\r\nthat is, seen in a patient who is expiring--just very short, irregular\r\ntype respirations.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you continue now to describe what you observed to be\r\nthe President's condition?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. We felt that he was in extreme shock, merely by the fact\r\nthat there was no motion, that he was somewhat cyanotic, his eyes\r\nwere--appeared to be fixed; there was no evidence of motion of the\r\neyes; and we noticed that he did not have a satisfactory airway or\r\nwas not breathing on his own in a satisfactory way to sustain life so\r\nthat we felt that either an endotracheal tube had to be instituted\r\nimmediately, which was done by Dr. Carrico. We felt that this was not\r\nadequate and since tracheotomy equipment was in the room, we felt that\r\nhe would profit more by tracheotomy and that we could be certain that\r\nhe was getting adequate oxygen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with respect to applying oxygen to the\r\nPresident then?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Well, a tracheotomy was done, and then an adapter was fitted\r\nto this tube, and we had an anesthesia machine there by this time with\r\nDr. Jenkins available so that he could give him straight oxygen from\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe anything else with respect to the\r\nPresident's condition at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. You mean as far as wounds--that he had?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. As we saw him the first time, we noticed that he had a small\r\nwound at the midline of the neck, just above the suprasternal notch,\r\nand this was probably no greater than a quarter of an inch in greatest\r\ndiameter, and that he had a large wound in the right posterior side of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we noticed,\" whom do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Well, Dr. Perry and I were the two that were there at this\r\ntime observing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Perry make any comment about the nature of the\r\nwound at that time? Either wound?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe as precisely as you can the nature of\r\nthe head wound?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. There was large defect in the back side of the head as the\r\nPresident lay on the cart with what appeared to be some brain hanging\r\nout of this wound with multiple pieces of skull noted next with the\r\nbrain and with a tremendous amount of clot and blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe as precisely as you can the wound that\r\nyou observed in the throat?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. The wound in the throat was probably no larger than a\r\nquarter of an inch in diameter. There appeared to be no powder burn\r\npresent, although this could have been masked by the amount of blood\r\nthat was on the head and neck, although there was no obvious amount\r\nof powder present. There appeared to be a very minimal amount of\r\ndisruption of interruption of the surrounding skin. There appeared to\r\nbe relatively smooth edges around the wound, and if this occurred as a\r\nresult of a missile, you would have probably thought it was a missile\r\nof very low velocity and probably could have been compatible with a\r\nbone fragment of either--probably exiting from the neck, but it was a\r\nvery small, smooth wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any lump in the throat area?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any blood on the throat area in the vicinity of\r\nthe wound which you have described of the throat?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Not a great deal of blood, as if in relation to the amount\r\nthat was around the head--not too much.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What further action was taken by the medical team in\r\naddition to that which you have described on the tracheotomy?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Well, as Dr. Perry started the tracheotomy, I started the\r\ncut down in the left arm to insert a large polyethylene catheter, to\r\ngive an I.V. so that we could give I.V. solutions as well as blood,\r\nand at the same time another doctor or two were doing some cutdowns\r\nin the lower extremities around the ankle. We made the cutdown in\r\nthe left arm in the cephalic vein very rapidly and I.V. fluids were\r\nstarted immediately and as I was doing this, Dr. Perry was performing\r\nthe tracheotomy, and it was about this time that Dr. Baxter came in\r\nand went ahead to assist Dr. Perry with the tracheotomy, and as they\r\nmade a deeper incision in the neck to isolate the trachea, they thought\r\nthey saw some gush of air and the possibility of a pneumothorax on\r\none side or the other was entertained, and since I was to the left of\r\nthe President, I went ahead and put in the anterior chest tube in the\r\nsecond intercostal space.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that tube fully inserted, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I felt that the tube was fully inserted, and this was\r\nimmediately connected to underwater drainage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by \"connected to underwater drainage\",\r\nDr. Jones?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. The tube is connected to a bottle whereby it aerates in\r\nthe chest from a pneumothorax and as the patient breathes, the air is\r\nforced out under the water and produces somewhat of a suction so that\r\nthe lung will reexpand and will not stay collapsed and this will give\r\nadequate aeration to the body, and we decided to go ahead and put in a\r\nchest tube on the opposite side; since I could not reach the opposite\r\nside due to the number of people that were working on the President.\r\nDr. Baxter was over there helping Dr. Perry on that side, as well as\r\nDr. Paul Peters, the assistant head of urology here, and the three of\r\nus then inserted the chest tube on the right side, primarily done by\r\nDr. Baxter and Dr. Peters on the right side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then what other treatment, if any, was afforded President\r\nKennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. After the tracheotomy was done, the intravenous fluid, blood\r\nwas started--I believe that the President was also administered some\r\nhydrocortisone because of his history of adrenal insufficiency, and\r\nat this time an electrocardiogram had been connected and it showed no\r\nevidence of a heartbeat. Closed cardiac massage was then first begun by\r\nDr. Perry and then I believe that after about 5 minutes no significant\r\nor no myocardial activity was present and he was pronounced dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What history did you refer to of President Kennedy's\r\nadrenal insufficiency?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. As I recall, there had been in news that the President\r\nhad several years ago been on some type of steroid therapy and that\r\nhe possibly had Addison's disease. We had no documented evidence\r\nthat he did or did not, but caution was taken nonetheless in case his\r\ninsufficiency was of severe enough nature, because at the time of\r\nsevere trauma a patient with adrenal insufficiency often goes into\r\na rapid degree of adrenal insufficiency and can expire from lack of\r\nsteroids being produced from the adrenal gland in such a stressed\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you obtain that history from Mrs. Kennedy, or any\r\nother person on the scene?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You just relied upon what had been occurring in the news?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would that reaction cause, if anything, if the\r\nPresident had no adrenal insufficiency?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. This would not cause severe effects on any organ at all if\r\nthe adrenal gland were producing enough steroids.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any other doctors arrive during the time this\r\ntreatment was going on, other than those whom you have already\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Several doctors did subsequently appear in the room--Dr.\r\nMcClelland appeared shortly after Dr. Baxter, within a matter of\r\njust a very few minutes, as well as Dr. Kemp Clark, who is head of\r\nneurosurgery here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any other doctors?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Dr. Jenkins was there and I think these are primarily\r\nthe ones that actually had any part, as far as taking care of the\r\nPresident, although there were some other doctors in the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Jones, I now hand you a report which purports to bear\r\nyour signature, labeled \"Summary of treatment of the President,\" dated\r\nNovember 23, 1963, which I shall now ask the Court Reporter to mark as\r\nDr. Jones' Exhibit No. 1.\r\n\r\n(Instrument mentioned marked by the Reporter as Dr. Jones' Exhibit No.\r\n1, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I ask you if this in fact is your signature?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I ask you if this was the report which you submitted\r\nconcerning your participation of the treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In this report, Dr. Jones, you state the following,\r\n\"Previously described severe skull and brain injury was noted as well\r\nas a small hole in anterior midline of the neck thought to be a bullet\r\nentrance wound.\" What led you to the thought that it was a bullet\r\nentrance wound, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. The hole was very small and relatively clean cut, as you\r\nwould see in a bullet that is entering rather than exiting from a\r\npatient. If this were an exit wound, you would think that it exited at\r\na very low velocity to produce no more damage than this had done, and\r\nif this were a missile of high velocity, you would expect more of an\r\nexplosive type of exit wound, with more tissue destruction than this\r\nappeared to have on superficial examination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be consistent, then, with an exit wound, but of\r\nlow velocity, as you put it?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes; of very low velocity to the point that you might think\r\nthat this bullet barely made it through the soft tissues and just\r\nenough to drop out of the skin on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your experience, Doctor, if any, in the treatment\r\nof bullet wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. During our residency here we have approximately 1 complete\r\nyear out of the 4 years on the trauma service here, and this is in\r\naddition to the 2 months that we spend every other day and every\r\nother night in the emergency room during our first year, so that we\r\nsee a tremendous number of bullet wounds here in that length of time,\r\nsometimes as many as four and five a night.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any formal training in bullet wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had occasion to observe a bullet wound which\r\nwas inflicted by a missile at approximate size of a 6.5 mm. bullet\r\nwhich passed through the body of a person and exited from a neck\r\nwithout striking anything but soft tissue from the back through the\r\nneck, where the missile came from a weapon of the muzzle velocity of\r\n2,000 feet per second, and the victim was in the vicinity of 160 to 250\r\nfeet from the weapon?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No; I have not seen a missile of this velocity exit in the\r\nanterior portion of the neck. I have seen it in other places of the\r\nbody, but not in the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other places in the body have you seen it, Dr. Jones?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I have seen it in the extremity and here it produces a\r\nmassive amount of soft tissue destruction.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that in the situation of struck bone or not struck bone\r\nor what?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Probably where it has struck bone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In a situation where it strikes bone, however, the bone\r\nbecomes so to speak a secondary missile, does it not, in accentuating\r\nthe soft tissue damage?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Jones, did you have any speculative thought as to\r\naccounting for the point of wounds which you observed on the President,\r\nas you thought about it when you were treating the President that day,\r\nor shortly thereafter?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. With no history as to the number of times that the President\r\nhad been shot or knowing the direction from which he had been shot, and\r\nseeing the wound in the midline of the neck, and what appeared to be an\r\nexit wound in the posterior portion of the skull, the only speculation\r\nthat I could have as far as to how this could occur with a single wound\r\nwould be that it would enter the anterior neck and possibly strike a\r\nvertebral body and then change its course and exit in the region of the\r\nposterior portion of the head. However, this was--there was some doubt\r\nthat a missile that appeared to be of this high velocity would suddenly\r\nchange its course by striking, but at the present--at that time, if I\r\naccounted for it on the basis of one shot, that would have been the way\r\nI accounted for it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would that account take into consideration the\r\nextensive damage done to the top of the President's head?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. If this were the course of the missile, it\r\nprobably--possibly could have accounted for it, although I would\r\npossibly expect it to do a tremendous amount of damage to the vertebral\r\ncolumn that it hit and if this were a high velocity missile would also\r\nthink that the entrance wound would probably be larger than the one\r\nthat was present at the time we saw it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe whether or not there was any damage to the\r\nvertebral column?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No, we could not see this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you discuss this theory with any other doctor or\r\ndoctors?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes; this was discussed after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With whom?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. With Dr. Perry--is the only one that I recall specifically,\r\nand that was merely as to how many times the President was shot,\r\nbecause even immediately after death, within a matter of 30 minutes,\r\nthe possibility of a second gunshot wound was entertained and that\r\npossibly he had been shot more than once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wound on the President's back?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the President ever turned over?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Not while I was in the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was he on when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. He was on an emergency room cart, which is on wheels and\r\ncan be changed to varying heights and also varying positions, as far\r\nas elevating the head or elevating the feet, lowering the head and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he ever taken off that cart from the time he was\r\nbrought into the emergency room to the time he was pronounced to be\r\ndead?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, are you working toward board certification at this\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your status on your progress with that,\r\ngenerally?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I will finish my formal training in surgery in July of this\r\nyear, which will complete 5 years of general surgery residency.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you at the present time, Dr. Jones?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Thirty-one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you discussed this matter with any representatives of\r\nthe Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes, I believe the Secret Service has been here on at least\r\ntwo occasions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did they ask you on those occasions?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. I think, primarily, to verify that what I had written was\r\ntrue and that I had been one of the first doctors to be in the room\r\nwith the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they ask you anything else other than that?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. On one occasion they asked if there were any other pieces\r\nof paper that had been written on as to the care that had been\r\nadministered to the President that I had not turned in, and I told them\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I sit down and talk for a few minutes\r\nbefore we went on the record in this deposition, with me indicating to\r\nyou the general purpose and the line of questioning, and you setting\r\nforth the same information which we have put on the record here today?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful to the Commission in any way?\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That concludes the deposition. Thank you very much, Dr.\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nDr. JONES. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. DON TEEL CURTIS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Don Teel Curtis was taken at 9:25 a.m., on March\r\n24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that present are Dr. Don Curtis and\r\nthe court reporter, in connection with the deposition proceeding\r\nbeing conducted by the President's Commission on the Assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, which is inquiring into all facets of the\r\nassassination, including the medical treatment performed for President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. Don Curtis is appearing here this morning in response to a letter\r\nrequesting him to testify concerning his knowledge of that medical\r\ntreatment of President Kennedy. With that preliminary statement of the\r\ngeneral objective of the Commission and the specific objective of this\r\ndeposition proceeding, Dr. Curtis, will you rise and raise your right\r\nhand, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Presidential\r\nCommission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Dr. Don Teel, T-e-e-l (spelling) Curtis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your occupation or profession?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Oral surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I attended my freshman year at Boulder, Colo., Colorado\r\nUniversity, 2 subsequent years of undergraduate work at Texas\r\nUniversity, 4 years at Baylor Dental College, and I have been interning\r\nhere for a year and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What year did you graduate from Baylor Dental College?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your age at the present time?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Twenty-six.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what has your work consisted of here at Parkland\r\nHospital?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I have functioned as an intern in oral surgery and also now\r\nam a resident this year in oral surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you a licensed dentist?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did you obtain that status in the State of Texas?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I think in August of 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to assist in the medical treatment\r\nof President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly the circumstances surrounding\r\nyour call or your joining in the participation in that medical effort?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I was--do you want me to tell from the time that I got to\r\nthe emergency room?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes--how did you happen to get to the emergency room?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I was in our out-patient clinic and saw the President's\r\ncar, or I saw that it had arrived at the emergency room entrance, and\r\nI went over there as a matter of curiosity and was directed into the\r\nemergency room and there was directed by a policeman into the room\r\nwhere President Kennedy was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time was that?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I don't know--it was shortly after he arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how long after he arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I would say it was within--I would say within a minute\r\nafter he arrived at the trauma room, although there's no way for me to\r\nknow that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present in the trauma room at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Dr. Carrico and a nurse, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know the identity of the nurse?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe, if anything, as to the condition of\r\nPresident Kennedy at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I observed that he was in a supine position, with his head\r\nextended, and I couldn't see on my arrival--I couldn't see the nature\r\nof the wounds, however, Dr. Carrico was standing at the patient's head.\r\nDr. Carrico had just placed an endotracheal tube and I participated in\r\napplying the Bird machine respirator into the endotracheal tube for\r\nartificial respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How does it happen that you would participate to that\r\neffect in view of the fact that you are an oral surgeon?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. We participate in the emergency room on traumatic injuries\r\nof both the face and the entire patient, because the face is hooked\r\nonto a patient. We have a tour through anesthesia. We spend time on\r\ngeneral anesthesia where we learn management of the patient's airway\r\nwhich makes us, I would say, qualified, for airway management. In our\r\ntraining here at the hospital we many, many times have patients on\r\nintravenous infusion and so we are well acquainted with the procedures\r\nattendant with the management of I.V. fluids.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there always someone from oral surgery available at the\r\ntrauma area?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. One of the oral surgeons is on call at the emergency room\r\nat all times and we try to stay within a very short distance from the\r\nemergency room. We see many patients in the emergency room area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that for the purpose of rendering aid for someone who\r\nwould be injured in a way which would call for an oral surgeon?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes--maxillofacial injuries.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in addition, you help out in a general way when there\r\nis an emergency situation?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was there anything in President Kennedy's condition\r\nwhich called for the application of your specific specialty?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, you aided in a general way in the treatment of him as\r\nan emergency case?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you continue to tell me what you have observed\r\nwith respect to his condition when you first saw him, including what\r\nyou noted, if anything, with respect to his respiration.\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. It is very difficult to say whether or not the President\r\nwas making a respiratory effort, but I'm not sure that he wasn't making\r\na respiratory effort.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think that he was making a respiratory effort?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. He could have been, and that's as far as I can go on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe movements of the chest?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I thought I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was his coloring?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. He was pink--he wasn't cyanotic when I saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you explain in lay terms what cyanotic means for\r\nthe record at this point?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. When the hemoglobin of the blood is reduced, it turns a\r\nblue color and the patient becomes blue, when a certain percentage of\r\nthe hemoglobin is reduced. That's not a lay term either, but when the\r\npatient is in oxygen need or oxygen want, cyanosis would be apparent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how does that manifest itself in the patient?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. The patient will be a blue, gray, ashen color.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action was Dr. Carrico taking upon your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. He had placed an endotracheal tube in the President's\r\ntrachea for artificial respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he doing anything else?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes; he was applying the Bird machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe what other steps he was taking, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. He directed that a tracheotomy setup be brought to the\r\nemergency room, and I think it was Dr. Carrico directed me to start the\r\nI.V. fluids.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, did you do in response to his\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I assisted him in fitting the tube from the Bird machine\r\nto the endotracheal tube and I assisted in removing some of the\r\nPresident's clothes and did the cutdown on his leg.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, specifically, did you do pursuant to the cutdown\r\non his leg?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. A small incision was made on the ankle and a vein is\r\nbluntly dissected free, small holes placed in the vein and a venous\r\ncatheter is placed in this vein and a purse string ligature is then\r\ntied around the catheter at one end, and then the wound was closed with\r\nsutures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you do anything else to the President following\r\nthat operative procedure?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Then, the initial cutdown that I started was ineffective\r\nand infiltrated into the tissues. I think possibly I cut the knot\r\ntoo close of the purse string ligature, so I was getting ready to do\r\nanother one and it was decided since fluids were going in the other\r\nleg, it wouldn't be necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other action did you take, if any, in the treatment\r\nof the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. That's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you remain in the trauma room No. 1?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I did until he was pronounced dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action was taken by anyone else in the trauma room\r\nwhile you were there?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. My attention was focused on what I was doing, so I wasn't\r\naware--I knew that a cutdown was being performed and that is about all\r\nI could see. I mean, I knew that a tracheotomy was being performed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other doctors were present there at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I know that Dr. Perry was there and I know Dr. Baxter was\r\nthere, and then I recall Dr. Jenkins from the Anesthesia Department,\r\nand Dr. Seldin, Dr. Crenshaw, and that's about all the doctors--I could\r\nthink of others probably, but I can't remember now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any other nurses who were there?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I can't--I wasn't paying attention to the nurses.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. During the course of your presence near President Kennedy,\r\ndid you have any opportunity to observe any wounds on his body?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. After I had completed the cutdown, I went around to the\r\nright side of the patient and saw the head wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe there?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Oh--fragments of bone and a gross injury to the cranial\r\ncontents, with copious amounts of hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other wound on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I didn't. As I said before, I noticed the mass in the\r\npre-tracheal area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say \"as you said before,\" you mean in our\r\nprevious discussions prior to going on the record here?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you state now for the record what you did notice\r\nwith respect to the tracheal area?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. The President's head was extended or hyperextended and I\r\nnoticed that in the suprasternal notch there was a mass that looked\r\nlike a hematoma to me, or a blood clot in the tissues.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How big was that hematoma?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Oh, I think it was 5 cm. in size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What color was it?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. It had no color--there was just skin overlying it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did it appear to be?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Probably a hematoma.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any perforation or hole in the President's\r\nthroat?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I didn't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to look closely for it?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. I focused my attention on his neck for an instant, and\r\nthat's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you hear any discussion among any of the doctors about\r\nan opening on his neck?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make any written report concerning your activity\r\non the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you any notes or writings of any sort concerning your\r\nwork with the President?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any representatives of the Federal\r\nGovernment about your participation in treating President Kennedy\r\nbefore today?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Prior to the time that we went on the record here with the\r\ncourt reporter, did you and I have a very brief conversation concerning\r\nthe purpose of the deposition and the general questions which I would\r\nask you on the record?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the information which you have provided on the\r\nrecord the same as that which you gave me before the court reporter\r\nstarted taking notes?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think would be\r\nhelpful to the Commission in its work?\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Curtis, for coming here today.\r\n\r\nDr. CURTIS. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. FOUAD A. BASHOUR\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Fouad A. Bashour was taken at 1:15 p.m., on March\r\n25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Fouad Bashour has appeared\r\npursuant to a letter of request from the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy, in connection with the Commission's\r\ninquiry into all of the factors surrounding the assassination of the\r\nPresident, including medical treatment received at Parkland Hospital,\r\nand Dr. Bashour's knowledge, if any, as related to the treatment in the\r\nemergency room.\r\n\r\nWith that preliminary statement of purpose, Dr. Bashour, would you mind\r\nrising and then raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. F-o-u-a-d (spelling), Fouad A. Bashour.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BASHOUR. I am an internist with a specialization in cardiology. I\r\nam associate professor of medicine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice\r\nmedicine here?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you board certified at the present time?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No, sir; I don't have my board because I am not yet a\r\ncitizen. I will be taking my citizenship this year, I hope, and then I\r\nwill be able to sit for the board.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to assist in the treatment of\r\nPresident Kennedy back on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes; we were called from the dining room, the doctors'\r\ndining room, and we went directly to the President Kennedy room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we\" whom do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Dr. Seldin and myself--we left the dining room and went\r\nright straight down to the President's room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is Dr. Seldin's first name?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Donald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is his specialty, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. He's chairman of the department of medicine and professor\r\nof medicine. He is a specialist and a recognized famous specialist in\r\nrenal diseases.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, in lay language, does that facet of medicine\r\ninvolve?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Kidney diseases.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Seldin accompany you into the emergency room where\r\nPresident Kennedy was located?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. We went to the room together and then I was left alone\r\nbecause this is a problem--a heart problem.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Dr. Seldin remain in the room with you?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Well, he came and stayed for--he just left the room after\r\nwe came in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did he stay in the room?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. A few seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present in the room when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. When I arrived, Dr. Kemp Clark was doing the cardiac\r\nmassage on the President, Dr. Jenkins was in charge of controlling\r\nartificial respiration of the President, and the probably there were\r\nsome three or four--I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe the President's condition to be\r\nat the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. The President was lying on the stretcher, the head wound\r\nwas massive, the blood was dripping from the head, and at that time\r\nthe President had an endotracheal tube, and his pupils were dilated,\r\nhis eyes were staring, and they were not reactive, there was no\r\npulsations, his heart sounds were not present, and his extremities were\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThen, we attached the scope--the cardioscope and there was a flip,\r\nthis was probably artificial. Upon stopping the cardiac machine, there\r\nwas no cardiac activity. That means the heart was standing still. We\r\ncontinued cardiac massage and still there was no cardiac activities, so\r\nthe President was declared dead shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time was he declared dead?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Well, according to my notes, we said here, \"Declared dead\r\nabout 12:55,\" or so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that a precise time fixed or was that just a general\r\napproximation?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No, sir; approximation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you refer to the \"flip\" what do you mean by that, Dr.\r\nBashour?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. On the scope--some change in the baseline of the scope.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that indicate some activity in the President's heart?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No, sir; not necessarily.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else could have accounted for the flip besides that?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Anything extraneous could have accounted for that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, you require a number of flips before you inquire if\r\nthere is heart activity?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Well, it depends on the configuration of the flip--if the\r\nflip resembles an electrocardiogram activity--it shows cardiac activity.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that configuration of the flip like heart activity or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. It wasn't, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is your field, is it not, you read those flips?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Well, it's my field to see the electrocardiograms; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, in your professional opinion, the flip which you saw\r\nwas not a conclusive indicator of heart activity?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. As a matter of fact, when he removed his hand, there was\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who is \"he\"?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Dr. Clark, who was doing the cardiac massage.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else was done to the President, if anything, in\r\naddition to those things you have already mentioned after you arrived\r\non the scene?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Really, as far as I know, it was the end of the\r\nscene--nothing was done afterward.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wound besides the head wound which you\r\nhave just described?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No; I did not observe any wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition of the front part of the\r\nPresident's neck upon your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. The only thing--it was covered with the endotracheal\r\ntube--I did not really pay attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to see the neck wound before\r\nthe tracheotomy was performed?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No; I came after everything was done to him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, I show you a group of papers heretofore marked\r\nas \"Commission Exhibit No. 392,\" and I call your attention to the\r\nphotostatic copy of a sheet which purports to be a report made by you\r\non November 22, 1963, at 4:45 p.m., is that your report?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that in fact your signature?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts set forth therein the essence of what\r\nyou observed and what you know about this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to anyone from the Federal Government\r\nprior to today about your treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. There was a security officer or something called me on the\r\nphone one day and said did I write any note besides this note on the\r\nchart, and I said \"No.\" I don't know his name even.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What note was he referring to?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. This note here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He asked you if you wrote what?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Other notes than this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you had any other notes?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have any other notes other than the one I have\r\njust shown you?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the Secret Service agent ask you anything else other\r\nthan that?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you talk to any other representative of the\r\nFederal Government on any occasion prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, did you and I talk for a few minutes about the type\r\nof questions I would be asking you during this deposition?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the information which you have given me on the\r\nrecord here and written down by the court reporter the same as you told\r\nme before she arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, will you give me just an outline of your educational\r\nbackground, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. I got my baccalaureate from French Government in\r\n1941--first part. I got my second part, baccalaureate in mathematics\r\nand science in 1942, I got my B.A. degree in 1944 from the American\r\nUniversity of Beirut, my M.D. degree in 1949, and my Ph. D. in 1957\r\nfrom the University of Minnesota. I came back to this country in 1959\r\nfrom the American University of Beirut, as an instructor, and from 1959\r\nto 1963 I jumped from instructor to assistant professor to associate\r\nprofessor in February 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think will be\r\nhelpful in any way to the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Bashour.\r\n\r\nDr. BASHOUR. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. GENE COLEMAN AKIN\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Gene Coleman Akin was taken at 11:30 a.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Gene Akin is present in\r\nresponse to a letter request that he appear to have his deposition\r\ntaken in connection with an inquiry being conducted by the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. Dr. Akin is being\r\nasked to appear here today to testify concerning his knowledge, if\r\nany, about the condition of President Kennedy on arrival in Parkland\r\nHospital and his treatment here.\r\n\r\nWith that preliminary statement of purpose, Dr. Akin, will you rise and\r\nraise your right hand, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you shall give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name, please?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Gene Coleman Akin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Medicine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed to practice in Texas, to practice\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any specialty?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Anesthesiology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you board-certified?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you working toward board-certification?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Premedical school at University of Texas in Austin, medical\r\nschool, Southwestern Medical School Branch of the University of Texas,\r\ninternship, Dallas Methodist Hospital, and anesthesiology residence at\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, starting in July 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, in what year did you graduate from medical school?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how old are you at the present time, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Thirty-four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render assistance to President\r\nJohn F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Briefly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state how you came to be called into the case?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I was notified while I was on duty in the operating suite of\r\nthe hospital that anesthesia assistance was needed in the emergency\r\nroom. President Kennedy supposedly had been shot and had been brought\r\nto the emergency room, and I immediately went down the back elevator\r\nto the emergency room to see if I could be of assistance, and when I\r\nwalked in, a tracheotomy was being performed. President Kennedy still\r\nhad an endotracheal tube, an oro-tracheal tube in place, and the\r\nconnector from this to the Bird respirator was removed. The anesthesia\r\nmachine had been simultaneously rolled into the room and Dr. Jenkins\r\nconnected the anesthesia machine to the oro-tracheal tube and it stayed\r\nthere for a brief period, until the tracheotomy tube was placed in the\r\ntracheotomy, at which time I connected the breathing tubes from the\r\nanesthesia machine to the tracheotomy and held this in place while Dr.\r\nJenkins controlled the ventilation with 100-percent oxygen from the\r\nanesthesia machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you assist Dr. Jenkins then in his work?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Only insofar as I held the endotracheal connector in place\r\ninto the tracheotomy tube.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors in addition to Dr. Jenkins then were present,\r\nif any, at the time of your arrival?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. You mean everybody in the room? I don't know that I can name\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Name as many as you can, if you will, please?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. There was Dr. Jenkins, there was myself for a brief period,\r\nthere was Dr. Giesecke, Dr. Jackie Hunt--they left shortly after\r\narriving. I heard later that they had gone across the hall to Governor\r\nConnally's room to assist him; Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. Charles Baxter,\r\nDr. Kemp Clark, Dr. Bob McClelland, Dr. James Carrico, Dr. Ron Jones,\r\nwas there. I think, shortly after I arrived, and Dr. Fouad Bashour\r\ncame in from cardiology; Dr. Don Seldin walked in briefly, I can't\r\nremember the team that worked on the cutdowns on the legs--I can't\r\nremember that. This is sort of hazy, because it was a couple of days\r\nlater we went through the same business over again and I am liable to\r\nsay that there was somebody there that worked on Kennedy that actually\r\nhad worked on Oswald, because I was on the Oswald mess too. This is all\r\nthat I remember were positively there. I remember their being there,\r\nbut there were others that I am not sure of.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the President's condition?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. He looked moribund in my medical judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wounds on him at the time you first\r\nsaw him?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. There was a midline neck wound below the level of the\r\ncricoid cartilage, about 1 to 1.5 cm. in diameter, the lower part of\r\nthis had been cut across when I saw the wound, it had been cut across\r\nwith a knife in the performance of the tracheotomy. The back of the\r\nright occipitalparietal portion of his head was shattered, with brain\r\nsubstance extruding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Returning to the wound which you first described, can you\r\nstate in any more detail the appearance of it at the time you first saw\r\nit?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I don't think I could--this is about all I noticed. I noticed\r\nthis wound very briefly and it was a matter of academics as to how he\r\nsustained the wound. My attention, because of my standing on the right\r\nside of the patient who was lying supine, my attention was very soon\r\ndirected to the head wound, and this was my major concern.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as to the neck wound, did you have occasion to observe\r\nwhether there was a smooth, jagged, or what was the nature of the\r\nportion of the neck wound, which had not been cut by the tracheotomy?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. It was slightly ragged around the edges.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you said that----\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No powder burns; I didn't notice any powder burns.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the dimension of the punctate wound, without\r\nregards to the tracheotomy which was being started?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. It looked--it was as you said, it was a punctate wound. It\r\nwas roughly circular, about, I would judge, 1.5 cm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you mean when you just made your reference to the\r\nacademic aspect with the wound, Dr. Akin?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Well, naturally, the thought flashed through my mind that\r\nthis might have been an entrance wound. I immediately thought it could\r\nalso have been an exit wound, depending upon the nature of the missile\r\nthat made the wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would be the circumstances on which it might be one\r\nor the other?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Well, if the President had been shot with a low velocity\r\nmissile, such as fire from a pistol, it was more likely to have been an\r\nentrance wound, is that what you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. If, however, he had been shot with a high velocity military\r\ntype of rifle, for example, it could be either an entrance wound or an\r\nexit wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why do you say it could be either an entrance wound or an\r\nexit wound with respect to the rifle?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Well, because a high velocity missile coming from a military\r\nrifle, especially if the missile were a jacketed missile, a copper- or\r\nsteel-jacketed missile, itself, the missile itself is not distorted\r\nwhen it passes through soft tissue, and the wound made when the bullet\r\nleaves the body, is a small wound, much like the wound of entrance, but\r\nlike I said, I didn't devote much time to conjecture about this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How much experience have you had, if any, on gunshot\r\nwounds, doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I can't really give you, say, how many cases a week I see of\r\nthis. Most of my experience with this is in an anesthetic situation\r\nwith patients coming into the hospital, having sustained gunshot\r\ninjuries, most of them are injured with low velocity missiles, smaller\r\ncaliber--.22 caliber to .38 caliber, and most of them are not injured\r\nin a through and through fashion. In other words, I don't see too many\r\nexit wounds, the bullets are slow moving, and they enter the body and\r\ndon't leave it. They usually stay in it, so consequently I could not be\r\nconsidered an expert in exit wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the general line of bullet wounds which come into\r\nParkland Hospital, would you say?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. What I have just described, you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes; I think so. Most of the people seem to be shot with\r\ncheap ammunition fired out of inferior weapons.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would your experience with the type of bullet wounds you\r\nhave just described be about the same as the other doctors have here at\r\nParkland, or would there be some difference between what you have seen\r\non bullet wounds and what the other doctors have seen?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I think so, except there is one difference--I am not\r\nordinarily on duty in the emergency room, so I am not very often the\r\nfirst doctor to see one of these people injured in this fashion. When I\r\nsee them they are people who have sustained a gunshot injury, but who\r\nlived to make it to the operating room. We, I'm sure, have a lot of\r\npeople who are shot and who are dead on arrival at the emergency room,\r\nand they are examined by the emergency room physicians, and I never\r\nsee them, so there would be a lot of people down there that I never\r\nhave seen. They might be injured with a hunting rifle or a good quality\r\nammunition, and I would not have seen them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Akin, permit me, if you will, to give you a set of\r\nfacts which I will ask you to assume for the purpose of giving me an\r\nopinion, if you are able to formulate one. Assume that the President\r\nwas struck by a 6.5 mm. missile which had a muzzle velocity of\r\napproximately 2,000 feet per second at a time when the President was\r\napproximately 160 to 250 feet away from the weapon. Assume further that\r\nthe bullet entered the President's body in the upper right posterior\r\nthorax just above the upper border of the scapula at a point 14 cm.\r\nfrom the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below the tip of\r\nthe right mastoid process. Assume further that the missile traveled\r\nthrough or in between, rather, the strap muscles without penetrating\r\neither muscle but going in between the two in the area of his back\r\nand traveled through the fascial channel without violating the pleura\r\ncavity, and that the bullet struck the side of the trachea and exited\r\nfrom the throat in the position of the punctate wound which you have\r\ndescribed you saw, would the wound you saw be consistent with a wound\r\nof exit under the factors that I have just outlined to you?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. As far as I know, it is perfectly compatible from what you\r\nhave described, except when you say it passed through without injuring\r\nthe strap muscles, are you talking about the anterior strap muscles of\r\nthe neck or are you talking about the posterior muscles of the neck?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The anterior strap muscles of the neck.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. It's a matter of clarification because there are no strap\r\nmuscles posterior, by my terminology. Yes, this is perfectly consistent\r\nwith what I know about, or what I have been told by military experts,\r\nconcerning high velocity missile injuries.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the basis of your information from the\r\nmilitary experts you just referred to?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Military rifle demonstrations when I was a senior student\r\nat Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio. We took a brief two day tour\r\nthere with demonstrations of high velocity missile injury.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to the head wound, Dr. Akin, did you observe\r\nbelow the gaping wound which you have described any other bullet wound\r\nin the back of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No; I didn't. I could not see the back of the President's\r\nhead as such, and the right posterior neck was obscured by blood and\r\nskull fragments and I didn't make any attempt to examine the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe the President's\r\nclothes?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I noticed them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With respect to examining the shirt, for example, to see\r\nwhat light that would shed, if any, on the trajectory of the bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No; I didn't. The front of the chest was uncovered, the pants\r\nhad been loosened and lowered below the iliac crest, and the only\r\narticle of clothing I noticed in particular was his back corset.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe with respect to the back corset which\r\nyou just mentioned?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. It had been loosened and was just lying loose.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe the corset, indicating how wide it was?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. The only portion I saw was the front portion of the corset\r\nand it was about, I'd say, 5 or 6 inches in width, and made out of\r\nsome white heavy fabric with the usual straps and buckles.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any Ace bandage strapping the President's\r\nbuttocks area?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that area of his anatomy visible to you?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Not his buttocks, he was lying supine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was President Kennedy ever turned over, to your knowledge?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Not while I was there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long were you there altogether, Dr. Akin?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Oh, probably 15, maybe 20--perhaps 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when he was pronounced to be dead?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes--I didn't leave until Dr. Clark and Dr. Jenkins had\r\nmutually agreed that nothing else could be done.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time was he pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. 1300 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Massive gunshot injury to the brain--primary cause.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have already described some of the treatment which was\r\nperformed on the President; could you supplement that by describing\r\nwhat else was done for the President?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Other than the placement of chest tubes, artificial\r\nrespiration, brief external cardiac massage--I don't know. Anything\r\nelse I said would be hearsay, and I understand that he did receive some\r\ncortisone. He received so much Ringer's lactate, but this is not of my\r\nown personal knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many bullets were involved in the wounds inflicted on\r\nthe President, Dr. Akin?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Probably two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever changed any of your original opinions in\r\nconnection with your observations of the President or any opinions you\r\nformed in connection with what you saw?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. You mean as to how he was injured?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, as to how he was injured.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Well, no; not really because I didn't have any opinions,\r\nnecessarily. Any speculation that I might have done about how he was\r\ninjured was just that, it was just speculation. I didn't form an\r\nopinion until it was revealed where he was when he was injured and\r\nwhere the alleged assassin was when he fired the shots, so I didn't\r\nhave any opinions. It was my immediate assumption that when I saw the\r\nextent of the head wound, I assumed at that point that he had probably\r\nbeen hit in the head with a high velocity missile because of the damage\r\nthat had been done. The same thing happened to his head and would\r\nhappen to a sealed can of sauerkraut that you hit with a high velocity\r\nmissile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opinion as to the direction that the\r\nbullet hit his head?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I assume that the right occipitalparietal region was the\r\nexit, so to speak, that he had probably been hit on the other side\r\nof the head, or at least tangentially in the back of the head, but I\r\ndidn't have any hard and fast opinions about that either.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed by any representative of the\r\nFederal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. You mean concerning this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Concerning this matter.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. I think I was probably interviewed by a member of the Secret\r\nService some weeks ago.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you say to him?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Virtually the same thing, as I recall--I didn't make as long\r\na statement, he just wanted to know where I was and what I did and I\r\ntold him briefly and that seemed to satisfy him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the only time you have been interviewed by any\r\nrepresentative of the Federal Government concerning this matter prior\r\nto today?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes; as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And before I started to take your deposition, did you and\r\nI have a very brief discussion about the nature of the deposition and\r\nthe questions I would ask you?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you give me about the same information, exactly\r\nthe same information you have put on the record here this morning?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. To my knowledge; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of\r\nassistance to the President's Commission in their inquiry?\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. No; I don't think so. I don't know exactly if there is any\r\ndisagreement or discrepancy in the testimony from the various people\r\nwho have testified, so I don't know. This is all I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's fine. Thank you very much, Dr. Akin.\r\n\r\nDr. AKIN. That's all right, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. PAUL CONRAD PETERS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Paul Conrad Peters was taken at 4 p.m., on March\r\n24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Paul Peters is present,\r\nhaving responded to a request to have his deposition taken in\r\nconnection with the investigation of the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy, which is investigating all aspects\r\nof the assassination, including the medical treatment of President\r\nKennedy at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and for the latter sequence of\r\nevents we have asked Dr. Peters to appear and testify what he knows, if\r\nanything, concerning that medical attention.\r\n\r\nWith that statement of purpose in calling you, Dr. Peters, may I ask\r\nyou to rise and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Paul Conrad Peters.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Doctor of medicine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And will you outline for me briefly your educational\r\nbackground?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I went to college at Indiana University in Bloomington,\r\nInd., and received an A.B. degree from Indiana University in 1950,\r\nand received an M.D. degree from Indiana University in 1953. I took\r\nmy internship at the Philadelphia General Hospital, 1953 and 1954. I\r\ntook my residency in Urological Surgery at Indiana University from\r\n1954 to 1957, and from 1957 to 1963 I was chief of Urology at U.S.A.F.\r\nHospital, Carswell, which is the largest hospital in SAC, and I was\r\nregional consultant to the surgeon general in Urological surgery. Since\r\nJuly 1963, I have been assistant professor of Urology at Southwestern\r\nMedical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you board certified, Dr. Peters?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I am certified by the American Board of Urology--1960.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render medical services to\r\nPresident John Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline briefly the circumstances relating\r\nto your arriving on the scene where he was?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. As I just gave you a while ago?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I was in the adjacent portion of the hospital preparing\r\nmaterial for a lecture to the medical students and residents later in\r\nthe day, when I heard over the radio that the President had been shot\r\nand there was a great deal of confusion at the time and the extent\r\nof his injuries was not immediately broadcast over the radio, and I\r\nthought, because of the description of the location of the tragedy he\r\nwould probably be brought to Parkland for care, and so I went to the\r\nemergency room to see if I could render assistance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at about what time did you arrive at the emergency\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, could I ask a question or two?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sure.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. As I recall, he was shot about 12:35 our time; is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I believe that's been fixed most precisely at 12:30, Dr.\r\nPeters.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. So, I would estimate it was probably about 12:50 when I got\r\nthere, I really don't know for certain.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whom did you find present, if anyone, when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. When I arrived the following people I noted were present\r\nin the room: Drs. Perry, Baxter, Ron Jones, and McClelland. The first\r\nthing I noticed, of course, was that President Kennedy was on the\r\nstretcher and that his feet were slightly elevated. He appeared to be\r\nplaced in a position in which we usually treat a patient who is in\r\nshock, and I noticed that Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter were present and\r\nthat they were working on his throat. I also noticed that Dr. Ron Jones\r\nwas present in the room. I took off my coat and asked what I could do\r\nto help, and then saw it was President Kennedy. I really didn't know\r\nit was President Kennedy until that time. Dr. Perry was there and he\r\nand Dr. Baxter were doing the tracheotomy and we asked for a set of\r\ntracheotomy tubes to try and get one of the appropriate size. I then\r\nhelped Dr. Baxter assemble the tracheotomy tube which he inserted into\r\nthe tracheotomy wound that he and Dr. Perry had created.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any others present at that time, before you go\r\non as to what aid you rendered?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I believe Dr. Carrico----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any other doctors present?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. And Dr. Jenkins was present.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now covered all of those who were present at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. And Dr. Shaw walked into the room and left--for a\r\nmoment--but he didn't stay. He just sort of glanced at the President\r\nand went across the hall. Mrs. Kennedy was in the corner with someone\r\nwho identified himself as the personal physician of the President--I\r\ndon't remember his name.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Burkley?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I don't know his name. That's just who he said he was,\r\nbecause he was asking that the President be given some steroids, which\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He requested that.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. That's right, he said he should have some steroids because\r\nhe was an Addisonian.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by that in lay language?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, Addison's disease is a disease of the adrenal cortex\r\nwhich is characterized by a deficiency in the elaboration of certain\r\nhormones that allow an individual to respond to stress and these\r\nhormones are necessary for life, and if they cannot be replaced, the\r\nindividual may succumb.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And Dr. Burkley, or whoever was the President's personal\r\nphysician, made a request that you treat him as an Addisonian?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. That's right--he recommended that he be given steroids\r\nbecause he was an Addisonian--that's what he said.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any nurses present at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I don't remember a nurse being in the room all the time,\r\nbut they were coming in and out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you identified all the people who were present to the\r\nbest of your recollection?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Did I mention Dr. Robert McClelland, he was also there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Dr. Dulany there?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I don't remember him, he may have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who else was there, if anyone, that you can recall, or\r\nhave you now given me everyone you can recall?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, I am giving you my impression of the situation as I\r\nwalked in and those are the ones I remember right now. Dr. Kemp Clark\r\nalso came in during the maneuvering.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, who else came in during the course of the operative\r\nprocedures?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. The anesthesiologists, Drs. Jenkins and Gene Akin, I\r\nbelieve, came in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anyone else come in?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I am not certain of anyone else.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, tell us what aid was rendered to President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter were doing the tracheotomy and\r\na set of tracheotomy tubes was obtained and the appropriate size was\r\ndetermined and I gave it to Baxter, who helped Perry put it into the\r\nwound, and Perry noted also that there appeared to be a bubbling\r\nsensation in the chest and recommended that chest tubes be put in. Dr.\r\nRon Jones put a chest tube in on the left side and Dr. Baxter and I put\r\nit in on the right side--I made the incision in the President's chest,\r\nand I noted that there was no bleeding from the wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you put that chest tube all the way in on the right\r\nside?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. That's our presumption--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what else was done for the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. About the same time--there was a question of whether he\r\nreally had an adequate pulse, and so Dr. Ronald Jones and I pulled his\r\npants down and noticed that he was wearing his brace which had received\r\na lot of publicity in the lay press, and also that he had an elastic\r\nbandage wrapped around his pelvis at--in a sort of a figure eight\r\nfashion, so as to encompass both thighs and the lower trunk.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the purpose of that bandage?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I presume that it was--my thoughts at the time were that\r\nhe probably had been having pelvic pain and had put this on as an\r\nadditional support to stabilize his lower pelvis. It seemed quite\r\ninteresting to me that the President of the United States had on an\r\nordinary $3 Ace bandage probably in an effort to stabilize his pelvis.\r\nI suppose he had been having some back pain and that was my thought at\r\nthe time, but we removed this bandage in an effort to feel a femoral\r\npulse. We were never certain that we got a good pulse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe in as much detail as you can the type\r\nof brace he was wearing?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, it appeared similar to a corset.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How thick was it?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I would estimate it was one-eighth of an inch.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. An eighth of an inch thick?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how high was it?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, it completely encompassed his midsection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It encompassed his midsection?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. His circumference--yes--and it was probably, I would guess\r\nabout 8 to 11 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In width?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Running in his waist area at the top of his hips up to the\r\nlower part of his chest?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I would estimate that it went from the lower part of his\r\nchest to the pelvic girdle. About this time it was noted also that he\r\nhad no effective heart action, and Dr. Perry asked whether he should\r\nopen the chest and massage the heart. In the meantime, of course, the\r\ntracheotomy had been done and completed and had been hooked on to\r\napparatus for assisting his respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action, if any, was taken on the open-heart\r\nmassage?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. It was pointed out that an examination of the brain had\r\nbeen done. Dr. Jenkins had observed the brain and Dr. Clark had\r\nobserved the brain and it was pointed out to Dr. Perry that it appeared\r\nto be a mortal wound, and involving the brain, and that open-heart\r\nmassage would probably not add anything to what had already been done,\r\nand that external cardiac massage is known to be as efficient as direct\r\nmassage of the heart itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any further treatment rendered to the President?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Yes, Dr. Perry began immediate external compression of\r\nthe chest in an effort to massage the heart, even before he asked the\r\nquestion as to whether the thoracotomy should be done. As soon as there\r\nwas a question as to whether there was a pulse or not, he immediately\r\nbegan external chest compression.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other action was taken to aid the President, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, cut downs were done on the extremities, and tubes\r\nwere inserted in the veins, and I know on the right ankle anteriorly,\r\nand I believe in the left arm and also in the left leg, in order to\r\nadminister fluid and blood which he did receive.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described all of the medical attention given\r\nthe President?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, I believe I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the President subsequently pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about what time was that pronouncement made?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I could not give you the time within 5 or 10 minutes--I can\r\ntell you this much, though, I know what actually did happen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell me that.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I was--we pronounced him dead and I was in the room,\r\npresent while the priest gave him the last rites, during which time\r\nthere was Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Baxter and Dr. McClelland, Mrs. Kennedy,\r\nthe priest, and myself. Dr. Perry had left, as had most of the others\r\nby that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you remain?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, I just hadn't gotten out of the door when the priest\r\nfirst came in and Dr. Jenkins asked everyone to leave except those\r\npeople I have just named.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did he exclude those from the group which were to\r\nleave?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, I think they were nurses, and several other people he\r\nthought just best not remain and I'm sure that there was no intention\r\nto personally exclude anyone behind his request. He just sort of looked\r\naround and saw who appeared to be there and asked the others to leave.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the nature of the President's\r\nwound?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, as I mentioned, the neck wound had already been\r\ninterfered with by the tracheotomy at the time I got there, but I\r\nnoticed the head wound, and as I remember--I noticed that there was a\r\nlarge defect in the occiput.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you notice in the occiput?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. It seemed to me that in the right occipitalparietal area\r\nthat there was a large defect. There appeared to be bone loss and brain\r\nloss in the area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any holes below the occiput, say, in this\r\narea below here?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No, I did not and at the time and the moments immediately\r\nfollowing the injury, we speculated as to whether he had been shot once\r\nor twice because we saw the wound of entry in the throat and noted\r\nthe large occipital wound, and it is a known fact that high velocity\r\nmissiles often have a small wound of entrance and a large wound of\r\nexit, and I'm just giving you my honest impressions at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were they?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, I wondered whether or not he had been shot once or\r\ntwice--that was my question at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we speculate,\" whom do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Well, the doctors in attendance there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any doctor specifically?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I wouldn't mention anyone specifically, we all discussed\r\nit. I did not know whether or not he had been shot once or twice.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to observe the wound on his\r\nneck prior to the time the tracheotomy was performed?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No, I did not. The tracheotomy was already being done by\r\nDr. Baxter and Dr. Perry when I got in the room. I did not see the\r\nwound on his neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make any written reports on the treatment of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No, I did not; no one asked me to.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you prepare any notes of any sort, or do you have any\r\nnotes of any sort?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the cause of death in your opinion?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I would assume that it was irreversible damage to the\r\ncenters in the brain which control the heart and respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any representatives of the Federal\r\nGovernment about this matter prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No; I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And prior to the time the court reporter came in, did you\r\nand I have a brief discussion as to the nature of this deposition and\r\nthe questions that I would ask you?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. No; I was not informed as to any specific questions. I knew\r\nthe general nature of the testimony which I would give.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From the discussion?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. From the letter I had received from the counsel signed by\r\nMr. Rankin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you and I have a brief conversation here in this\r\nroom today before the court reporter came in?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Yes; we did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of\r\nassistance to the President's Commission in its investigation?\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. I do not--regarding the immediate condition of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Peters, we are very\r\nmuch obliged to you.\r\n\r\nDr. PETERS. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ADOLPH HARTUNG GIESECKE, JR.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Adolph Hartung Giesecke, Jr., was taken at 1:40\r\np.m., on March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex.,\r\nby Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the Presidents Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr., is\r\npresent in response to a letter request from the Commission to appear\r\nat this deposition proceeding in connection with the President's\r\nCommission to Investigate the Assassination of President Kennedy,\r\nincluding his medical treatment at Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Giesecke has been asked to appear to testify about his knowledge of\r\nthe treatment that President Kennedy and Governor Connally received at\r\nParkland Hospital on November 22, and with that preliminary statement\r\nof purpose and objective, would you please stand up, Dr. Giesecke, and\r\nraise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this\r\nPresident's Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name, please, for the record?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Adolph Hartung Giesecke, Jr. H-a-r-t-u-n-g (spelling).\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I am a physician and anesthesiologist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you board-certified?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you working for board-certification?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I graduated--how far back do you want me to go?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Start with college, graduation from college, if you would,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I was on an accelerated plan through the University of\r\nTexas but have no college degree. I matriculated to medical school\r\nin 1953, September 1953, graduated May 30, 1957, from the University\r\nof Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Tex. I did my internship at\r\nWilliam Beaumont Army Hospital at El Paso, following which I served\r\n24 months on active duty in the Army as an aviation medical officer.\r\nI was stationed primarily at the Presidio at San Francisco, Calif.\r\nUpon discharge from the Army, I came to Parkland Hospital, completed a\r\n3-year residency in anesthesiology in July 1963. Since that time I have\r\nbeen an assistant professor on the anesthesiology staff at Southwestern\r\nMedical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render medical attention to\r\nPresident Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline the circumstances under which you were\r\ncalled into that matter?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I was eating lunch in the cafeteria when Dr. Jenkins\r\napproached the table and told me that the President had been shot and\r\nasked me to bring some resuscitative equipment from the operating room\r\nto the emergency room, which I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what time did you arrive at the emergency room,\r\napproximately?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Can I look and see when I induced the Governor?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes. May the record show that Dr. Giesecke is now\r\nreferring to a letter from A. H. Giesecke, Jr., M.D., to Mr. C. J.\r\nPrice, administrator, dated November 25, 1963, which I will ask the\r\nreporter to mark as \"Dr. Giesecke's Exhibit No. 1.\"\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as \"Dr. Giesecke Exhibit\r\nNo. 1,\" for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me ask you a question or two, first about this, Dr.\r\nGiesecke, to qualify--is this a copy of the report which you submitted\r\nto Mr. Price?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes, that is a real copy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And all the facts contained in this report are true and\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do they concern the treatment which was rendered by\r\nyou to President Kennedy and Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, refer to that if you wish, if it will help you answer\r\nthe last question.\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I arrived in the emergency room at 12:40 p.m., between\r\n12:40 and 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was present at the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Dr. Jenkins was present, Dr. Carrico, Dr. Dulany, Dr.\r\nBaxter, Dr. Perry, Dr. McClelland, and Drs. Akin and Hunt arrived at\r\nthe same time that I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other people present, such as nurses?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room--I could not say--I can't\r\nsay who else was there. There may have been a nurse there, I just don't\r\nremember. It seemed to me there was a Secret Service man there too,\r\nwith Mrs. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure Dr. Dulany was there, as distinguished from\r\nbeing with Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Perhaps--perhaps--I'm shaky on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The reason I asked you about that specifically is because\r\nDr. Carriro testified this morning that he and Dr. Dulany were on duty\r\nand Dr. Dulany went immediately with Governor Connally and Dr. Carrico\r\nwent to President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. That may well be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition of the President when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. There was a great deal of blood loss which was apparent\r\nwhen he came in the room--the cart was covered with blood and there\r\nwas a great deal of blood on the floor. There was--I could see no\r\nspontaneous motion on the part of the President. In other words, he\r\nmade no movement during the time that I was in the room. As I moved\r\naround towards the head of the emergency cart with the anesthesia\r\nmachine and the resuscitative equipment and helped Dr. Jenkins to\r\nhook the anesthesia machine up to the President to give him oxygen,\r\nI noticed that he had a very large cranial wound, with loss of brain\r\nsubstance, and it seemed that most of the bleeding was coming from the\r\ncranial wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe specifically as to the nature of the\r\ncranial wound?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. It seemed that from the vertex to the left ear, and from\r\nthe browline to the occiput on the left-hand side of the head the\r\ncranium was entirely missing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that the left-hand side of the head, or the right-hand\r\nside of the head?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I would say the left, but this is just my memory of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's your recollection?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Right, like I say, I was there a very short time--really.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other wound or bullet hole below the\r\nlarge area of missing skull?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No; when I arrived the tracheotomy was in progress at\r\nthat time and so I observed no other wound except the one on the\r\ncranium.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the cranium itself, did you observe another bullet hole\r\nbelow the portion of missing skull?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No, sir; this was found later by Dr. Clark--I didn't see\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What makes you say that that hole was found later by Dr.\r\nClark?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Well, this is hearsay--I wasn't there when they found it\r\nand I didn't notice it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, Dr. Clark didn't observe that hole.\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Oh, he didn't--I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From whom did you hear that the hole had been observed, if\r\nyou recollect?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Oh--I must be confused. We talked to so many people about\r\nthese things--I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, with respect to the condition of the President's\r\nneck, what was its status at the time you first observed it?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Well, like I say, they were performing the tracheotomy,\r\nand I personally saw no wound in the neck other than the tracheotomy\r\nwound. As soon as the tracheotomy was completed, we removed the\r\nendotracheal tube and hooked the anesthesia machine to the tracheotomy\r\ntube and efforts were made then to put in a chest tube, an anterior\r\nchest tube.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long were you with President Kennedy altogether?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Approximately 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now described everything which was done during\r\nthe time you were there?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No--after having assisted Dr. Jenkins in establishing\r\na ventilation, I then hooked up a cardiotachioscope or an electronic\r\nelectrocardiographic monitor to the President by putting needles in the\r\nskin and plugging the thing in the wall, plugging the monitor in the\r\nwall. Before the machine had sufficient time to warm up to see if there\r\nwere any electrical activity, then I was called out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have any occasion to return to the room where\r\nthe President was?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were you called to?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I was called across the hall where Governor Connally\r\nwas being moved out of the emergency treatment room and toward the\r\noperating room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action did you take at that time, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. I had my equipment with me--I had taken my equipment\r\nwith me from the room where the President was, having ascertained that\r\nDr. Jenkins didn't need anything that I had, and so I proceeded to the\r\nelevator. We moved the equipment and the Governor--the Governor went on\r\nthe first elevator and I caught the second one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you go on the second elevator?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. To the second floor where the operating suite is, moved\r\noff of the elevator and down to operating room 5, which was being set\r\nup for the Governor. The Governor had arrived and I obtained from\r\nthe anesthesia orderly an anesthesia machine, checked it for safe\r\noperation, and discussed the Governor's condition a little bit with\r\nhim, and determined that he was conscious and that he could respond to\r\nquestions and that he hadn't eaten in the previous several hours, and\r\nproceeded to induce an anesthesia.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, are all the details of your activity in connection\r\nwith Governor Connally's operation contained in the report marked \"Dr.\r\nGiesecke's Exhibit No. 1\"?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you talked about\r\nthis matter with a number of people--whom have you talked to, Dr.\r\nGiesecke?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Well, of course, we discussed it with Dr. Jenkins\r\nand various members of the anesthesia staff. We have discussed it\r\nwith--I've forgotten that gentleman's name, but he was from the\r\nAmerican Medical Association, as a historian. We discussed it with Dr.\r\nMike Bush, who then reported it in the Anesthesiology Newsletter, which\r\nis a publication of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and then\r\ndiscussed it with the Secretary of--may I retract that. That's about\r\nit--that's the extent of the discussion, except with other members of\r\nthe surgical staff and the anesthesia staff and these people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever discussed this matter with any\r\nrepresentative of the Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes; there was a well documented Secret Service man here\r\nwho said he was from the Warren Commission about a month ago, I imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by \"well documented\"?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Well, I mean he had a badge and a card and he seemed to\r\nbe legitimate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you tell him, if anything?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. He was asking rather specifically if we had made other\r\nnotes than the reports that we had already submitted, so in essence\r\nit was just a matter of telling him, \"No, I didn't have any other\r\ninformation written down except what I had already given.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what had you already given--that letter report?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That is marked \"Giesecke Exhibit No. 1\"?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has any other representative talked to you from the\r\nFederal Government about this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This afternoon prior to the time we went on the record,\r\ndid I ask you a few questions and discuss the nature of this deposition\r\nproceeding, and did you give me information just as you have on the\r\nrecord here after the court reporter started to take everything down?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Yes; that's correct. She was out of the room for a few\r\nminutes before we started.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful to the Warren Commission in its investigation?\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. No, I think that pretty well covers what I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May I thank you very much, Dr. Giesecke? That's fine.\r\n\r\nDr. GIESECKE. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. JACKIE HANSEN HUNT\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Jackie Hansen Hunt was taken at 1:12 p.m., on\r\nMarch 24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Jackie H. Hunt is present,\r\nand may I show for the record that the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy is conducting an inquiry into all\r\nthe facts surrounding the assassination of the President, and the\r\nmedical care performed on President Kennedy at Parkland Memorial\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunt appears here today in response to a letter requesting that her\r\ndeposition be taken, and may the record reflect the additional fact\r\nthat Dr. Hunt is a lady doctor.\r\n\r\nWould you at this time, Dr. Hunt, stand up and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name, please?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Jackie Hansen Hunt, H-a-n-s-e-n (spelling).\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Medical doctor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, are you duly licensed to practice medicine by the\r\nState of Texas?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in what year were you so licensed?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. 1950.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I graduated from medical school at Tulane College of Medicine\r\nin 1949. I had a year of rotating internship followed by a year of\r\npediatric residency. In 1961 I started a residency in anesthesiology,\r\nwhich I completed in 1963, and I am now a fellow in anesthesiology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you board certified, then, Dr. Hunt, at this time?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you working toward board certification?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes, I am. I am eligible and will take the first part in June.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion on November 22 to render medical aid\r\nto the late President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your\r\nbeing called into the case?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I was in Parkland Hospital on duty with the anesthesiology\r\ndepartment and was notified by our chief of staff, Dr. M. T. Jenkins,\r\nthat the President had been shot. Together with Dr. Giesecke and\r\nDr. Akin, I got an anesthesia machine and put it on an elevator and\r\nchecked it out and set it up on the way to the emergency room and took\r\nit into the emergency room where the President was and he had been\r\nintubated, and I helped Dr. Jenkins connect the anesthesia machine to\r\nthe endotracheal tube which at that time was being run, I believe, by\r\na Bird machine, and after making certain that the connections were\r\nproperly done, I placed the equipment in Dr. Jenkins' hands.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors were present when you arrived there, Dr. Hunt?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Dr. Jenkins, Dr. Malc Perry--quite a number of others--I just\r\ncan't remember who was there today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were any nurses present?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes--I don't know the names of any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you observe as to the condition of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. The first good look I took at him I noticed that his eyes\r\nwere opened and that the pupils were widely dilated and fixed and so I\r\nassumed that he was in essence dead.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time did you arrive in the emergency\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I don't know--it would have been--I would think near 12:45,\r\nbut I have really never even thought about it and I frankly don't\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long after you arrived did you have an opportunity\r\nto observe the President in the way which you have just described?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. How long was it from the time I came in until I looked at him?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, ma'am.\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. A minute--2 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any other observations at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No--other than that everyone was working on him. They were\r\ndoing cardiac massage, closed chest massage, I.V.'s were running, and\r\nothers were being started.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I.V.'s?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Intravenous fluids and, of course, our department was\r\nbreathing for him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say \"breathing for him,\" what do you mean by\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Ventilating him--an endotracheal tube down into the trachea\r\nattached to an anesthesia machine with 100 percent oxygen going, and by\r\nmanual compression of the bag, ventilating him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any wounds on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I actually did not see the wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you at any time see a wound to the head?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No; I didn't see it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there something obscuring your view from seeing\r\nthe head wound?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes; I could see his face and I could also see that a great\r\ndeal of blood was running off of the table from his right side and I\r\nwas on his left side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you near his head or foot or the middle of the body?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I was about midbody actually, well, no--more at his shoulder,\r\nwhen I leaned over to look at him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever observe any wound in the neck?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I did not actually see the wound in the neck. I say that\r\nbecause I assumed there was a wound--someone's hand was there and there\r\nwas blood present, but there was blood on nearly everyone.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the condition of his throat when you first\r\nobserved him, if you did observe it at all?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I couldn't--I don't know--I can't say. You mean, as far as\r\ninside or outside?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Outside.\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I don't actually remember seeing anything except someone's\r\nhands were using a sponge or something was present in the area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What medical operation, if any, was performed on his\r\nthroat?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe a tracheotomy being performed on his\r\nthroat?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No--that's not to say that they were not doing one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else was done for the President other than that which\r\nyou have already described?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Well, let's see, I don't--as far as actual observation,\r\nI didn't--other things were done--I left at this time and went to\r\nGovernor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At about what time did you leave President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I was probably in the room no more than 4 minutes at the most.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had he been pronounced dead by the time you left?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No; he had not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you go when you left the President's room?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Straight across to operating room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you find in operating room 2 when you arrived\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Governor Connally was present there and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors, if any, were present when you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Red Duke--I'm sorry, I just don't remember who the others\r\nwere. There were three or four.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action was being taken with respect to Governor\r\nConnally upon your arrival there?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. They were placing chest tubes, as a matter of fact, they had\r\none in and were putting the other one in, and were--they had an I.V.\r\ngoing, I believe someone had done a cutdown, and they were checking\r\nother wounds. He had a wound on his arm and another wound down on his\r\nleg, I think, and that was about it--preparing to take him promptly up\r\nto surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do on that occasion?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I walked in and Dr. Duke looked up and the first thing I did\r\nwas to look at the Governor--I took his pulse and he spoke to me and\r\nsaid something, and noted his color.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the Governor say to you?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. He said something like, \"It hurts,\" not anything real\r\nspecific, but he did at least speak, and it was a conscious thought\r\ntype of thing, so that he was more or less alert, responding, so then I\r\nstepped back into the hall and signaled a fellow, a medical student who\r\nhas been in our department, that is rotating through anesthesia, and I\r\nhappened to see him just outside the door, and I asked him to please go\r\nupstairs and bring me another unit of equipment and then came back in\r\nand told Dr. Duke I had sent for equipment, although I didn't believe\r\nthe Governor was going to need it, and he said that he was very glad\r\nthat I had and he, too, didn't think he would need it, but he should\r\nhave it as a standby, and then they brought me a machine and my table\r\ndown and I stayed with the Governor until he was ready to go upstairs,\r\nbut he did not require any respiratory aid because he was not that\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you participate any further with the treatment of\r\nGovernor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. When we were ready to go upstairs, I went back to the room\r\nwhere the President was and Dr. Giesecke, who is a staff member from\r\nour department, appeared relatively free and I asked him if he would\r\ncome and go upstairs with the Governor and I came on upstairs in a\r\ndifferent route. I didn't go in the elevator with the Governor--Dr.\r\nGiesecke went with him, and helped Dr. Giesecke get under way with the\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How did you go upstairs, by what route?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I don't know--I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other elevator going up to the operating\r\nrooms?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes; there are four elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But do those lead from the emergency rooms?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No; you come down this long hallway up to those of the ground\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there more than one elevator for the stretcher to go\r\nthrough from the emergency room up to the second floor operating rooms?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes; they can--they come up to these.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What route would they have to take to do this?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. They would have to come directly out of the emergency room\r\nand down this main hallway to this front bank of elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be a pretty long route, would it not?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Actually, it isn't very long. I don't know in yards or paces\r\neven, but there are three elevators there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What route did Governor Connally use?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I think they took him by the back elevator, the one that\r\ncomes down into the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the one they customarily use to take people from\r\nthe emergency area into the operating room?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes; if there is an emergency it goes straight up--they\r\nusually use that one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say you went back to President Kennedy's room?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe there at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. At that time I did notice, and possibly this was there\r\nearlier, I noticed that they had gotten more monitoring equipment\r\nin and connected the electronic equipment for monitoring the\r\nelectrocardiogram.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time did you return to President Kennedy's room?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I don't know--it would probably have been maybe 3 or 4 or 5\r\nminutes from the time I stepped out, because I went across the hall--I\r\ndidn't know the Governor was there, and someone told me and I went in\r\nand just took a brief look at him to sort of size up his condition, and\r\nstepped out and sent for my equipment and went back in and stayed until\r\nthey brought my equipment. It would have been a little longer than 4 or\r\n5 minutes because they had to bring the equipment down the elevator and\r\nit had arrived and been there a few minutes--3 or 4 minutes before we\r\nwere ready to take him upstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was going on in the President's room when you\r\nreturned there?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Well, there were still a goodly number of people, oh, at\r\nleast 10 people, possibly there were more--I'm not real sure, but\r\nthere were still--at that time there were, I know, at least three\r\nanesthesiologists in there--Dr. Jenkins, Dr. Akin, and Dr. Giesecke,\r\nand I believe Dr. Baxter was in there, and Dr. Perry was still there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they still working on the President at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes, sir; I don't know what they were doing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long did you stay on that occasion?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Just, oh, a minute--just long enough to catch Dr. Giesecke's\r\neye and let him know I was there and going out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you ever return to the President's room?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No; I don't believe I did--no; I'm sure I didn't, because I\r\ncame on upstairs with Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you participate then with Governor Connally's\r\noperation?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. I helped Dr. Giesecke during the induction of anesthesia.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any representative of the Federal\r\nGovernment prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make any written report of your participation in\r\nthe care of Governor Connally and President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Not directly. Dr. Giesecke called me one day and said that, I\r\nthink it was the A.M.A. was here and just wanted to verify my movements\r\nfor the day, which I told him and he in turn told them that--I did not\r\nappear before them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you make any written reports yourself?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any notes of any sort concerning your\r\nparticipation?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. None whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Prior to the time the court reporter started to take down\r\nthe transcript of my questions and your answers, did you and I have a\r\nbrief discussion about the purpose of this deposition?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the questions I would ask you?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is the information which you have provided on the\r\nrecord the same as you told me before the written deposition started?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Elaborated somewhat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of\r\naid to the Commission in its investigation?\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for appearing, Dr. Hunt.\r\n\r\nDr. HUNT. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. KENNETH EVERETT SALYER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Kenneth Everett Salyer was taken at 6:15 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Kenneth Salyer is present\r\nin response to an inquiry that he appear to have his deposition taken\r\nin connection with the inquiries being conducted by the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which is looking\r\ninto all facts of the shooting, including the wounds of the President\r\nand the care he received at Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nWith that preliminary statement of purpose, Dr. Salyer, will you stand\r\nup and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in the course of this deposition will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you had an opportunity to examine the document or the\r\nExecutive order creating the President's Commission and Rules for the\r\ntaking of testimony?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing to have your deposition taken today\r\nwithout having the formal three days of written notice, which you have\r\na right to, if you wish?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are willing to waive that right, is that right?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Kenneth Everett Salyer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine by the State of\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. A B.S. degree at the University of Kansas, an M.D. degree\r\nat the University of Kansas, and internship at Parkland, and now a\r\nfirst year resident in surgery at Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what year did you graduate from the University of\r\nKansas Medical School?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how old are you, Dr. Salyer?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I am 27.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your\r\nbeing called in to assist in the treatment of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Well, for the month of November, as part of our rotation\r\non surgery, I spent that month on neurosurgery, and being on call that\r\nday for any emergencies which come in to our emergency room related to\r\nneurosurgical problems, we would be called down to the emergency room\r\nto see these, and I was upstairs viewing a movie when I heard that\r\nthe President had arrived and so I thought I should go down to the\r\nemergency room and see what the situation was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, upon your arrival at the emergency room, who was\r\npresent?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Oh, I don't recall--I know that there were a room full of\r\ndoctors--I could list specific ones that I remember if you would like.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you please?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I don't really think I could give you every one, but I\r\nremember Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter, and also Dr. Bob\r\nMcClelland and Dr. Carrico and Dr. Crenshaw, and I think a Dr. Gene\r\nAkin was there also--at that time, when I first came in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you think of any others?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. No; I don't recall any others--there could have been some,\r\nthere were a lot of people sort of moving in and out. There certainly\r\nwere a lot of nurses in there at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any of the nurses who were there?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. No; I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the President's condition at the time you arrived?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. It was critical.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe about him with respect to any wounds\r\nhe may have sustained?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Well, I observed that he did have some sucking wound of\r\nsome type on his neck, and that he also had a wound of his right\r\ntemporal region--these were the two main wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to observe his throat?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. No; I really did not. I think there were a lot of people--a\r\nlot of doctors more closely around him. I might mention also, I think\r\njust right after I came in the room Dr. Clark and Dr. Grossman also\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor who?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Dr. Grossman, just briefly. He's a neurosurgeon also.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is his name?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Dr. Grossman--Bob Grossman. He was just there, I think,\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long was he there?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I couldn't say--I'm not sure he came in the room. I know\r\nthey were together--I cannot say that for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To what extent did Dr. Crenshaw participate?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Dr. Crenshaw participated about the extent that I did. We\r\nwere occupied in making sure an I.V. was going and hanging up a bottle\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the--is Dr. Crenshaw a resident?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Yes, he is third-year resident. That's the reason I\r\nremember him specifically because we were sort of working there\r\ntogether on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I had asked you a moment ago whether you had an\r\nopportunity to observe the condition of the President's throat.\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your answer to that question?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. The answer was--there were a lot of doctors standing\r\naround, and I didn't really get to observe the nature of the wound in\r\nthe throat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time did you arrive at the emergency\r\nroom where the President was situated?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I really don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done for the President by way of treatment that\r\nyou observed?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Well, an adequate airway eventually, of course, some\r\nexternal cardiac massage--he had I.V.'s--intravenous fluids going in a\r\nnumber of sites, and all of the acute measures we administered him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I didn't hear you at the end of your answer.\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I said--all of the many other measures that we\r\nadministered--I don't recall specifically some of the other details as\r\nfar as medications and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe with respect to the head wound?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. I came in on the left side of him and noticed that his\r\nmajor wound seemed to be in his right temporal area, at least from the\r\npoint of view that I could see him, and other than that--nothing other\r\nthan he did have a gaping scalp wound--cranial wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has anyone from the Federal Government talked to you about\r\nyour observations of this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. No one has.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think may be of aid\r\nto the President's Commission in its inquiry?\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. No, I believe not.\r\n\r\nDr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Salyer.\r\n\r\nDr. SALYER. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. MARTIN G. WHITE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Martin G. White was taken at 6:35 p.m., on March\r\n25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Martin White is present in\r\nresponse to a request that he appear to have his deposition taken\r\nbecause he has been identified in prior depositions as being one of the\r\ndoctors in attendance on President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. White, have you had an opportunity to examine the Executive order\r\ncreating the Presidential Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to examine the resolution\r\nsetting forth the rules for taking depositions?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you willing to have your deposition taken without the\r\n3-day notice to which you have a right under the rules, if you wish to\r\nreceive formal written notice? And have three days after mailing before\r\nyou appear to have your deposition taken?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. No, I want to have it taken now.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are willing to waive that requirement?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you stand up, then, and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Martin G. White.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. M.D.--physician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you duly licensed in the State of Texas to practice\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. In this institution.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your educational background, please?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I have a bachelor of medicine degree from Northwestern\r\nUniversity and a master of science degree from Northwestern University\r\nand a doctor of medicine degree from Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How old are you, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Twenty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you in attendance when President Kennedy was being\r\ntreated on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what were the circumstances of your being called into\r\nthe case?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I was the intern assigned to the surgery section of the\r\nemergency room on that day and was there when the President's body was\r\nbrought into the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do in connection with the President's\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I put an intervenous cutdown in the President's right foot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have an opportunity to observe any of his wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I saw the wound in his head as he was brought into the\r\ntrauma room where he was treated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any other wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. No, I did not see any other.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe specifically a wound in the neck?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I did not look and did not observe any.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long were you present while the President was being\r\ntreated?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I would estimate about 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you leave prior to the time he was pronounced to\r\nbe dead?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you leave?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. My duties had been completed and there was work elsewhere,\r\nwith the Governor, to be done.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was present at the time you were there, Dr. White?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. As best I can recall, Dr. Carrico and I were the physicians\r\nimmediately present when the President's body was brought in, plus a\r\nnumber of individuals who accompanied the cart on which his body was\r\nlying, and the only individual who I knew in that group was his wife,\r\nMrs. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what doctors were present at the time you left the\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Well, it would be impossible for me to tell you all the\r\npeople that were there, but I knew Dr. Carrico, Dr. Baxter, Dr. Perry\r\nand Dr. Zedelitz, Z-e-d-e-l-i-t-z (spelling)--I know they were there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor who--what is his first name?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. William Zedelitz.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To what extent did he participate?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I don't believe that he had any--I don't know what he did\r\nother than the fact that when I was doing the cutdown he assisted me by\r\njust placing some tape over the catheters we used to do this with.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is he an intern as you are?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. He is a surgical resident here at this hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who else was present?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. I can't be sure that I saw anyone else, although, as I\r\nsay--many people were there whose faces I can't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any of the nurses who were present?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes; one of the nurses--there were two there, Jeanette, and\r\nher last name--I don't know at the present time, and she is chief nurse\r\nin the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doris Nelson?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Jeanette Standridge?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. Yes; Jeanette Standridge was the other nurse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of\r\nhelp to the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. White for coming.\r\n\r\nDr. WHITE. All right, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. ROBERT SHAW\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Robert Shaw was taken at 6 p.m., on March 23,\r\n1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Robert Shaw is present,\r\nhaving responded to a request to have his deposition taken in\r\nconnection with the President's Commission on the Assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy, which is investigating all facts relating to the\r\nmedical care of President Kennedy and Governor Connally, and Dr. Shaw\r\nhas been requested to appear and testify concerning the treatment on\r\nGovernor Connally.\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw, will you rise and raise your right hand, please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in the course of this deposition proceeding will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Robert Roeder Shaw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Physician and surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline briefly your educational background,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I received my B.A. degree from the University of Michigan\r\nin 1927 and M.D. degree in 1933. My surgical training was obtained at\r\nRoosevelt Hospital in New York City, July 1934 to July 1936, and my\r\ntraining in thoracic surgery at the University Hospital, Ann Arbor,\r\nMich., July 1936 to July 1938. Do you want me to say what happened\r\nsubsequent to then?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; will you outline your medical career in brief form\r\nsubsequent to that date, please?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I entered private practice, limited to thoracic surgery,\r\nAugust 1, 1938. I have continuously practiced this specialty in Dallas,\r\nwith the exception of the period from June 1942 to December 1945,\r\nwhen I was a member of the Medical Corps of the Army of the United\r\nStates, serving almost all of this period in the European theatre of\r\noperations. I was again absent from Dallas from December 1961 until\r\nJune 1963, when I headed the medico team and performed surgery at the\r\nAvicenna Hospital at Kabul, Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you Board certified, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes. I am certified by the Board of Thoracic Surgery, date\r\nof certification--1948. At the present time I am professor of thoracic\r\nsurgery and chairman of the division of thoracic surgery at the\r\nUniversity of Texas, Southwestern Medical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to perform any medical care for\r\nPresident Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to care for Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate the circumstances of your being called in\r\nto care for the Governor, please?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I was returning to Parkland Hospital and the medical school\r\nfrom a conference I had attended at Woodlawn Hospital, which is\r\napproximately a mile away, when I saw an open limousine going past\r\nthe intersection of Industrial Boulevard and Harry Hines Boulevard\r\nunder police escort. As soon as traffic had cleared, I proceeded on\r\nto the medical school. On the car radio I heard that the President\r\nhad been shot at while riding in the motorcade. Upon entering the\r\nmedical school, a medical student came in and joined three other\r\nmedical students. He stated that President Kennedy had been brought in\r\ndead on arrival to the emergency room of Parkland Hospital and that\r\nGovernor Connally had been shot through the chest. Upon hearing this, I\r\nproceeded immediately to the emergency room of the hospital and arrived\r\nat the emergency room approximately 5 minutes after the President and\r\nGovernor Connally had arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you find Governor Connally at that time, Dr.\r\nShaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I found Governor Connally lying on a stretcher in emergency\r\nroom No. 2. In attendance were several men, Dr. James Duke, Dr. David\r\nMebane, Dr. Giesecke, an anesthesiologist. As emergency measures, the\r\nopen wound on the Governor's right chest had been covered with a heavy\r\ndressing and manual pressure was being applied. A drainage tube had\r\nbeen inserted into the second interspace in the anterior portion of\r\nthe right chest and connected to a water-sealed bottle to bring about\r\npartial reexpansion of the collapsed right lung. An intravenous needle\r\nhad been inserted into a vein in the left arm and intravenous fluid was\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nI was informed by Dr. Duke that blood had already been drawn and sent\r\nto the laboratory to be crossmatched with 4 pints of blood, to be\r\navailable at surgery. He also stated that the operating room had been\r\nalerted and that they were merely waiting for my arrival to take the\r\nGovernor to surgery, since it was obvious that the wound would have to\r\nbe debrided and closed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what time did the operation actually start, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. That, I would have to refresh my memory on that--now, this,\r\nof course--the point he began the anesthesia--that would be about\r\nright--but I have to refresh my memory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to make available on the record for you the\r\noperative record which has been heretofore marked as Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 392, with the exhibit consisting of the records of Parkland\r\nHospital on President Kennedy as well as Governor Connally and I call\r\nyour attention to a 2-page report which bears your name as the surgeon,\r\nunder date of November 22, 1963, of thoracic surgery for Governor\r\nConnally, and, first, I ask you if in fact this report was prepared by\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, with that report, is your recollection refreshed as\r\nto the starting time of the operation on Governor Connally's chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; the anesthesia was begun at 1300 hours.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which would be 1 p.m.?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. 1 p.m., and the actual incision was made at 1335 or 1:35 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what time did that operation conclude?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. My operation was completed at 1520 hours, or 3:20.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe Governor Connally's condition, Dr. Shaw,\r\ndirecting your attention first to the wound on his back?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. When Governor Connally was examined, it was found that\r\nthere was a small wound of entrance, roughly elliptical in shape, and\r\napproximately a cm. and a half in its longest diameter, in the right\r\nposterior shoulder, which is medial to the fold of the axilla.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the axilla, in lay language, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The arm pit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, will you describe next the wound of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; the wound of exit was below and slightly medial to the\r\nnipple on the anterior right chest. It was a round, ragged wound,\r\napproximately 5 cm. in diameter. This wound had obviously torn the\r\npleura, since it was a sucking wound, allowing air to pass to and fro\r\nbetween the pleura cavity and the outside of the body.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Define the pleura, please, Doctor, in lay language.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The pleura is the lining of the chest cavity with one layer\r\nof pleura, the parietal pleura lining the inside of the chest wall,\r\ndiaphragm and the mediastinum, which is the compartment of the body\r\ncontaining the heart, its pericardial sac, and great vessels.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the characteristics of these two bullet wounds\r\nwhich led you to believe that one was a wound of entry and one was a\r\nwound of exit, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The wound of entrance is almost invariably the smaller\r\nwound, since it perforates the skin and makes a wound approximately or\r\nslightly larger than the missile. The wound of exit, especially if it\r\nhas shattered any bony material in the body, will be the larger of the\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What experience, Doctor, have you had, if any, in\r\nevaluating gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I have had considerable experience with gunshot wounds and\r\nwounds due to missiles because of my war experience. This experience\r\nwas not only during the almost 2 years in England, but during the time\r\nthat I was head of the Thoracic Center in Paris, France, for a period\r\nof approximately a year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you be able to give an approximation of the total\r\nnumber of bullet wounds you have had occasion to observe and treat?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Considering the war experience and the addition of wounds\r\nseen in civilian practice, it probably would number well over a\r\nthousand, since we had over 900 admissions to the hospital in Paris.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the line of trajectory, Dr. Shaw, between the\r\npoint in the back of the Governor and the point in the front of the\r\nGovernor, where the bullet wounds were observed?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Considering the wound of entrance and the wound of exit, the\r\ntrajectory of the bullet was obliquely downward, considering the fact\r\nthat the Governor was in a sitting position at the time of wounding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As an illustrative guide here, Dr. Shaw----\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. May I add one sentence there?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Please do.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The bullet, in passing through the Governor's chest wall\r\nstruck the fifth rib at its midpoint and roughly followed the slanting\r\ndirection of the fifth rib, shattering approximately 10 cm. of the rib.\r\nThe intercostal muscle bundle above the fifth rib and below the fifth\r\nrib were surprisingly spared from injury by the shattering of the rib,\r\nwhich again establishes the trajectory of the bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would the shattering of the rib have had any effect in\r\ndeflecting the path of the bullet from a straight line?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It could have, except that in the case of this injury, the\r\nrib was obviously struck so that not too dense cancellus portion of the\r\nrib in this position was carried away by the bullet and probably there\r\nwas very little in the way of deflection.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At this time, Dr. Shaw, I would like to call your\r\nattention to an exhibit which we have already had marked as Dr.\r\nGregory's Exhibit No. 1, because we have used this in the course of his\r\ndeposition earlier today and this is a body diagram, and I ask you,\r\nfirst of all, looking at Diagram No. 1, to comment as to whether the\r\npoint of entry marked on the right shoulder of Governor Connally is\r\naccurate?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes. The point of entry as marked on this exhibit I consider\r\nto be quite accurate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the size and dimension of the hole accurate on scale,\r\nor would you care to make any adjustment or modification in that\r\ncharacterization by picture?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. As the wound entry is marked on this figure, I would say\r\nthat the scale is larger than the actual wound or the actual depicting\r\nof the wound should be. As I described it, it was approximately a\r\ncentimeter and a half in length.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw, Dr. Shaw, right above the shoulder as best\r\nyou can recollect, what that wound of entry appeared at the time you\r\nfirst observed it? Would you put your initials right beside that?\r\n\r\n(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with the request of Counsel Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, directing your attention to the figure right beside,\r\nshowing the front view, does the point of exit on the lower chest of\r\nthe figure there correspond with the point of exit on the body of\r\nGovernor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I would say that it conforms in every way except that it\r\nwas a little nearer to the right nipple than depicted here.\r\n\r\nOff the record, just a minute.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, in our off-the-record conversation, you called\r\nmy attention to your thought that the nipple line is incorrectly\r\ndepicted on that figure, would you, therefore, in ink mark on there the\r\nnipple line which would be more accurate proportionately to that body?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I feel the nipple line as shown on this figure is a\r\nlittle high and should be placed at a lower point on the body, which\r\nwould bring the wound of exit, which I feel is in the proper position,\r\nmore in line with the actual position of the nipple.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, with the wound of exit as it is shown there, does\r\nthat correspond in position with the actual situation on Governor\r\nConnally's body as you have redrawn the proportion to the nipple line?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you put an \"X\" through the old nipple line so we\r\nhave obscured that and put your initials beside those two marks, if you\r\nwould, please?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. By the \"X-1\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, please.\r\n\r\n(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with request of Counsel Specter in\r\ndrawing on the figure heretofore mentioned.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as to the proportion of the hole depicting the point\r\nof exit, is that correct with respect to characterizing the situation\r\non Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It is, and corresponds with the relative size of the two\r\nwounds as I have shown on the other figure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you at this time, right above the right shoulder\r\nthere, draw the appearances of the point of exit as nearly as you can\r\nrecollect it on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. This is right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say the hole which appears on Governor Connally is\r\njust about the size that it would have been on his body?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; it is drawn in good scale.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In good scale to the body?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw it on another portion of the paper here in\r\nterms of its absolute size?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Five cm. it would be--about like that--do you want me to mark\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Put your initials right in the center of that circle.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I'll just put \"wound of exit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine--just put \"wound of exit--actual size\" and put your\r\ninitials under it.\r\n\r\n(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with request of Counsel Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that Dr. Shaw has marked \"wound of\r\nexit--actual size\" with his initials R.R.S. on the diagram 1.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at diagram 2, Dr. Shaw, does the angle of declination on\r\nthe figure correspond with the angle that the bullet passed through\r\nGovernor Connally's chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any feature of diagram 3 which is useful in\r\nfurther elaborating that which you have commented about on diagram 1?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No. Again off the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have just commented off the record, Dr. Shaw, that\r\nthe wound of entry is too large proportionately to the wound of exit,\r\nbut aside from that, is there anything else on diagram 3 which will be\r\nhelpful to us?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there anything else on diagram 4 which would be helpful\r\nby way of elaborating that which appeared on diagram 2?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now as to the treatment or operative procedure which you\r\nperformed on Governor Connally, would you now describe what you did for\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. As soon as anesthesia had been established and an\r\nendotracheal tube was in place so that respiration could be controlled\r\nwith positive pressure, the large occlusive dressing which had been\r\napplied in the emergency room was removed. This permitted better\r\ninspection of the wound of exit, air passed to and fro through the\r\ndamaged chest wall, there was obvious softening of the bony framework\r\nof the chest wall as evidenced by exaggerated motion underneath the\r\nskin along the line of the trajectory of the missile.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the chest wall axilla and back were thoroughly cleaned and\r\naseptic solution was applied for further cleaning of the skin, the\r\nwhole area was draped so as to permit access to both the wound of exit\r\nand the entrance wound. Temporarily, the wound of entrance was covered\r\nwith a sterile towel.\r\n\r\nFirst an elliptical incision was made to remove the ragged edges of the\r\nwound of exit. This incision was then extended laterally and upward in\r\na curved direction so as to not have the incision through the skin and\r\nsubcutaneous tissue directly over the line of the trajectory of the\r\nbullet where the chest had been softened.\r\n\r\nIt was found that approximately 10 cm. of the fifth rib had been\r\nshattered and the rib fragments acting as secondary missiles had been\r\nthe major contributing factor to the damage to the anterior chest wall\r\nand to the underlying lung.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean, Doctor, by the words \"fragments acting\r\nas secondary missiles\"?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. When bone is struck by a high velocity missile it fragments\r\nand acts much like bowling pins when they are struck by a bowling\r\nball--they fly in all directions.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you continue now and further describe the treatment\r\nwhich you performed?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The bony fragments were removed along with all obviously\r\ndamaged muscle. It was found that the fourth and fifth intercoastal\r\nmuscle bundles were almost completely intact where the rib had been\r\nstripped out. There was damage to the latissimus dorsi muscle, but\r\nthis was more in the way of laceration, so that the damage could be\r\nrepaired by suture. The portion of parietal pleura which had not been\r\ntorn by the injury was opened along the length of the resected portion\r\nof the fifth rib. The jagged ends of the fifth rib were cleaned with\r\na rongeur; approximately 200 cc. of clot and liquid blood was removed\r\nfrom the pleura cavity; inspection of the lung revealed that the middle\r\nlobe had a long tear which separated the lobe into approximately two\r\nequal segments. This tear extended up into the hilum of the lobe, but\r\nhad not torn a major bronchus or a major blood vessel. The middle\r\nlobe was repaired with a running No. 3 O chromic gut approximating\r\nthe tissue of the depths of the lobe, with two sutures, and then\r\napproximating the visceral pleura on both the medial and lateral\r\nsurface with a running suture of the same material--same gut.\r\n\r\nUpon repair of the lobe it expanded well upon pressure on the\r\nanesthetic bag with very little in the way of peripheral leak.\r\n\r\nAttention was next turned to the lower lobe. There was a large hematoma\r\nin the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe extending on into\r\nthe median basal segment. At one point there was a laceration in the\r\nsurface of the lobe approximating a centimeter in length, undoubtedly\r\ncaused by one of the penetrating rib fragments. A single mattress\r\nsuture No. 3 O chromic gut on an atromitac needle was used to close\r\nthis laceration from which blood was oozing.\r\n\r\nNext, the diaphragm and all parts of the right mediastinum was examined\r\nbut no injury was found.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the drainage tube which had already been placed in\r\nthe second interspace in the anterior axillary line which protruded\r\ninto the chest was cut away, since it was deemed to be longer than\r\nnecessary. A second drainage tube was placed through a stab wound in\r\nthe eighth interspace in the posterior axillary line and both of these\r\ntubes were connected to a water sealed bottle. The fourth and fifth\r\nintercoastal muscle bundles were then approximated with interrupted\r\nsutures of No. O chromic gut.\r\n\r\nThe remaining portion of the serratus anterior muscle was then\r\napproximated across the closure of the intercostal muscles. The\r\nlaceration at the latissimus dorsi muscle was then approximated with\r\nNo. O chromic guts suture. Before closing the skin and subcutaneous\r\ntissue a stab wound approximately 2 cm. in length was made near the\r\nlower tip of the right scapula and a latex rubber drain was drawn up\r\nthrough this stab wound to drain subscapular space. This drain was\r\nmarked with a safety pin. The subcutaneous tissue was then closed with\r\ninterrupted sutures of No. O chromic gut, inverting the knots. The skin\r\nwas closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures of black silk.\r\n\r\nAttention was next turned to the wound of entrance. The skin\r\nsurrounding the wound was removed in an elliptical fashion, enlarging\r\nthe incision to approximately 3 cm. Examination of the depths of this\r\nwound reveal that the latissimus dorsi muscle alone was injured, and\r\nthe latex rubber drain could be felt immediately below the laceration\r\nin the muscle. A single mattress suture was used to close the\r\nlaceration in the muscle. The skin was then closed with interrupted\r\nvertical mattress sutures of black silk. The drainage tubes going into\r\nthe pleura cavity were then secured with safety pins and adhesive tape\r\nand a dressing applied to the entire incision. This concluded the\r\noperation for the wound of the chest, and at this point Dr. Gregory and\r\nDr. Shires entered the operating room to care for the wounds of the\r\nright wrist and left thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe, Dr. Shaw, as to the wound of the\r\nright wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Well, I would have to say that my observations are probably\r\nnot accurate. I knew that the wound of the wrist had fractured the\r\nlower end of the right radius and I saw one large wound on the--I\r\nguess you would call it the volar surface of the right arm and a small\r\nwound on the dorsum of the right wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which appeared to you to be the point of entrance, Dr.\r\nShaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. To me, I felt that the wound of entrance was the wound on the\r\nvolar surface or the anterior surface with the hand held in the upright\r\nor the supine position, with the wound of exit being the small wound on\r\nthe dorsum.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the characteristics of those wounds which led\r\nyou to that conclusion?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Although the wound of entrance, I mean, although the wound\r\nthat I felt was a wound of entrance was the larger of the two, it was\r\nmy feeling that considering the large wound of exit from the chest,\r\nthat this was consistent with the wound that I saw on the wrist. May we\r\ngo off the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sure.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness Dr. Shaw off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, let's go back on the record.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I'll start by saying that my examination of the wrist was a\r\ncursory one because I realized that Dr. Gregory was going to have the\r\nresponsibility of doing what was necessary surgically for this wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you conferred with him preliminarily to starting your\r\noperation on the chest so that you knew he would be standing by, I\r\nbelieve as you testified earlier, to perform the wrist operation?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes--Dr. Gregory was in the hallway of the operating room\r\nbefore I went in to operate on Governor Connally and while I was\r\nscrubbing preparatory to the operation, I told him that there was a\r\ncompound comminuted fracture of the radius of the Governor's right hand\r\nthat would need his attention.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that while we were off the record\r\nhere a moment ago, Dr. Shaw, you and I were discussing the possible\r\nangles at which the Governor might have been sitting in relation\r\nto a trajectory of a bullet consistent with the observations which\r\nyou recollect and consistent with what seems to have been a natural\r\nposition for the Governor to have maintained, in the light of your view\r\nof the situation. And with that in mind, let me resume the questioning\r\nand put on the record very much of the comments and observations\r\nyou were making as you and I were discussing off the record as this\r\ndeposition has proceeded.\r\n\r\nNow, you have described a larger wound on the volar or palm side of the\r\nwrist than was present on the dorsal or back side of the wrist, and you\r\nhave expressed the opinion that it was the point of entry on the volar\r\nside of the wrist as opposed to a point of exit on the back side of the\r\nwrist, even though as you earlier said, ordinarily the point of entry\r\nis smaller and the point of exit is larger.\r\n\r\nNow, will you repeat for the record, Dr. Shaw, the thinking--your\r\nthinking which might explain a larger point of entry and a smaller\r\npoint of exit on the wrist.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes. As a matter of fact, when I first examined Governor\r\nConnally's wrist, I did not notice the small wound on the dorsum of\r\nthe wrist and only saw the much larger wound on the radial side of the\r\nvolar surface of the wrist. I didn't know about the second small wound\r\nuntil I came in when Dr. Gregory was concluding his operation on the\r\nwrist. He informed me that there was another small wound through the\r\nskin through which a missile had obviously passed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, which wound was that, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. This was the wound on the dorsum or the dorsal surface of the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you then observe that wound?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I saw this wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where was that wound located to the best of your\r\nrecollection?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. This wound was slightly more distal on the arm than the\r\nlarger wound and located almost in the midportion of the dorsum of the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that correspond with this location which I read from\r\nDr. Gregory's report on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist over the\r\njunction of the distal fourth of the radius and shaft approximately 2\r\ncm. in length.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The wound was approximately 2 cm. in length?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; would that correspond with the wound which you\r\nobserved?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I saw it at the time that he was closing it and that\r\nwould correspond with the wound I observed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He has described that as what he concluded to be the wound\r\nof entry on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist, but your thought was\r\nthat perhaps that was the wound of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; in trying to reconstruct the position of Governor\r\nConnally's body, sitting in the jump seat of the limousine, and the\r\nattitude that he would assume in turning to the right--this motion\r\nwould naturally bring the volar surface of the right wrist in contact\r\nwith the anterior portion of the right chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is your principal reason for thinking that the wound\r\non the dorsal aspect is a wound of exit rather than a wound of entry\r\nbecause of what you consider to be the awkward position in having the\r\ndorsal aspect of the wrist either pointing upward or toward the chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, I think I am influenced a great deal by the fact that in\r\ntrying to assume this position, I can't comfortably turn my arm into\r\na position that would explain the wound of the dorsal surface of the\r\nwrist as a wound of entrance, knowing where the missile came out of the\r\nchest and assuming that one missile caused both the chest wound and the\r\narm wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Might not then that conclusion be affected if you discard\r\nthe assumption that one missile caused all the wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, if two missiles struck the Governor, then it would not\r\nbe necessary to assume that the larger wound is the wound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would not another explanation for the presence of\r\na wound on the dorsal aspect of the wrist be if the Governor were\r\nsitting in an upright position on the jump seat with his arm resting\r\neither on an arm rest inside the car or on a window of the car with the\r\nelbow protruding outward, and as he turned around, turning in a rotary\r\nmotion, his wrist somewhat toward his body so that it was present in an\r\nangle of approximately 45 degrees to his body, being slightly moving\r\ntoward his body.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Well, I myself, am not able to get my arm into that position.\r\nIf the wound, as I assume to be in the midportion of the forearm\r\nhere and the wound of exit would be here (illustrating) I can't get\r\nmy arm into that position as to correspond to what we know about the\r\ntrajectory of the bullet into the chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming that the bullet through the chest then also went\r\nthrough the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, aside from the trajectory and the explanation of one\r\nbullet causing all the damage and focusing just on the nature of the\r\nwound on the wrist, what conclusion would you reach as to which was the\r\npoint of entrance and which was the point of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I would feel that the wound on the volar surface of the wrist\r\nwas the wound of entrance and that perhaps the bullet being partially\r\nspent by its passage through the chest wall, struck the radius,\r\nfragmenting it, but didn't pass through the wrist, and perhaps tumbled\r\nout into the clothing of Governor Connally with only a small fragment\r\nof this bullet passing on through the wrist to go out into the left\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would that be consistent with a fragment passing\r\nthrough the wrist which was so small that virtually the entire missile,\r\nor 158 grains of it, would remain in the central missile?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes. The wound on the volar surface, I'm sorry, on the dorsum\r\nof the wrist and the wound in the thigh which was obviously a wound of\r\nentrance, since the fragment is still within the thigh, were not too\r\ndissimilar in size.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was the wound in the thigh itself, that is, aside from the\r\nsize of the fragment which remains in the leg, as small as the hole on\r\nthe dorsal aspect of the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. My memory is that the wound in the thigh through the skin was\r\nabout the same as the mound on the skin of the dorsum of the wrist, but\r\nI didn't make an accurate observation at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would your thinking on that be affected any if I informed\r\nyou that Dr. Shires was of the view and had the recollection that the\r\nwound on the thigh was much larger than a hole accounted for by the\r\nsize of fragments which remained in the femur.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Of course, Dr. Shires actually treated and closed this\r\nwound, but since this wound was made through the skin in a tangential\r\nmanner----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you are referring to the wound of the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I am referring to the wound of the thigh--was made in a\r\ntangential manner, it did not go in at a direct right angle, the slit\r\nin the skin in the thigh could be considerably longer than the actual\r\nsize of the missile itself, because this is a sharp fragment that would\r\nmake a cutting--it would cause a laceration rather than a puncture\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, the hole in the thigh would be consistent with a very\r\nsmall fragment in the femur?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, a moment ago I asked you what would be your opinion\r\nas to the point of entry and the point of exit based solely on the\r\nappearances of the holes on the dorsal and volar aspects of the wrist,\r\nand you responded that you still thought, or that you did think that\r\nthe volar aspect was the point of entry with the additional thought\r\nthat the missile might not have gone through the wrist, but only a\r\nfraction having gone through the wrist--now, my question is in giving\r\nthat answer, did you consider at that time the hypothesis that the\r\nwound on the wrist was caused by the same missile which went through\r\nthe Governor's chest, or was that answer solely in response to the\r\ncharacteristics of the wound on the wrist alone?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I have always felt that the wounds of Governor Connally could\r\nbe explained by the passage of one missile through his chest, striking\r\nhis wrist and a fragment of it going on into his left thigh. I had\r\nnever entertained the idea that he had been struck by a second missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, focusing for just a minute on the limited question\r\nof the physical characteristics of the wounds on the wrist, if you had\r\nthat and nothing more in this case to go on, what would your opinion be\r\nas to which point was entry and which point was exit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Ordinarily, we usually find the wound of entrance is smaller\r\nthan the wound of exit. In the Governor's wound on the wrist, however,\r\nif the wound on the dorsum of the wrist is the wound of entrance, and\r\nthis large missile passed directly through his radius, I'm not clear as\r\nto why there was not a larger wound of exit than there was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean on the volar aspect?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; if a whole bullet hit here----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating the dorsal aspect?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; and came out through here, why it didn't carry more\r\nbone out through the wrist than it did, and the bone was left in the\r\nwrist--the bone did not come out. In other words, when it struck the\r\nfifth rib it made a hole this big around (indicating) in the chest in\r\ncarrying bone fragments out through the chest wall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Wouldn't that same question arise if it went through the\r\nvolar aspect and exited through the dorsal aspect?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It wouldn't if you postulated that the bullet did not pass\r\nthrough the wrist, but struck the wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be present in either event, though, if you\r\npostulated if the bullet struck the dorsal aspect of the wrist, and did\r\nnot pass through, but only a missile passed through the volar aspect.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; in that case, however, considering the wound of exit\r\nfrom the chest, and if that same bullet went on through the wrist, I\r\nwould still expect a pretty good wound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You see, I am trying now, Dr. Shaw, to disassociate the\r\nthought that this is the same missile, so that I'm trying to look at\r\nit just from the physical characteristics of the appearance of the\r\nwounds on the two sides of the wrist.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. May we go off the record just a minute?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sure--off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let us go back on the record and let the record reflect\r\nthat we have been discussing another aspect concerning Dr. Shaw's\r\nthought that if the main missile had gone through the entire radius,\r\nthat there would have been more damage, presumably, to the arteries and\r\ntendons on the underside of the wrist, and I then called Dr. Shaw's\r\nattention to one additional factor in Dr. Gregory's testimony which is\r\nreflected in his report that \"on the radial side of the arm, small fine\r\nbits of cloth consistent with fine bits of mohair were found,\" which\r\nwas one of the reasons for Dr. Gregory's thinking that the path was\r\nfrom the dorsal aspect to the volar aspect.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And Dr. Shaw's reply, if this is correct, Doctor, that you\r\nwould know of no readily available explanation for that factor in the\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Except that it might have been carried by the small fragment\r\nwhich obviously passed through the wrist and attached to that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But could the fragment have carried it from the radial\r\nside on it if it had been traveling from the volar side to the radial\r\nside?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; it could have carried it through and deposited it on the\r\nway through.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I see, so it might have started on the volar aspect and\r\ncould have gone on through.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. You know, if we could get that suit of his, it would help a\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, we are going to examine clothing if at all possible.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Because, I think it would have been almost impossible--I\r\nthink if you examine the clothing and if you had a hole here in his\r\ncoat and no hole on this side----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Indicating a hole on the femur side----\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. That would almost clear that thing up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; it would be very informational in our analysis of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I doubt if there is a hole in both sides of the sleeve--the\r\nsleeve wouldn't be quite that long, I don't think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, my next question involves whether you have ever\r\nhad a conversation with Governor Connally about the sequence of events\r\nof the day he was shot?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, we have talked on more than one occasion about this.\r\nThe Governor admits that certain aspects of the whole incident are a\r\nbit hazy. He remembers hearing a shot. He recognized it as a rifle\r\nshot and turned to the right to see whether President Kennedy had been\r\ninjured. He recognized that the President had been injured, but almost\r\nimmediately, he stated, that he felt a severe shock to his right chest.\r\nHe immediately experienced some difficulty in breathing, and as he\r\nstated to me, he thought that he had received a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he tell you why he thought the wound was mortal?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. He just knew that he was badly hit, as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he comment on whether or not he heard a second shot\r\nbefore he felt this wound in his chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. He says that he did not hear a second shot, but did hear--no,\r\nwait a minute, I shouldn't say that. He heard only two shots so that he\r\ndoesn't know which shot other than the first one he did not hear. He\r\nonly remembers hearing two shots, his wife says distinctly she heard\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Connally said she heard three?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Mrs. Connally distinctly remembered three shots.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, Governor Connally said he heard two shots?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Two shots.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that not be consistent with a situation where he was\r\nhit by the second shot and lost consciousness?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; the shock of the wounding might have prevented him from\r\nhearing the rifle report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have expected him to hear a third shot after he\r\nwas wounded by a second shot?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. He didn't lose consciousness at that time, although he said\r\nhe did lose consciousness during a part of the trip from the point of\r\nwounding to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Governor Connally tell you whether or not he heard\r\nPresident Kennedy say anything?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. He said that all he heard was the President say, \"Oh,\" that's\r\nthe only thing he told me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mrs. Connally state whether or not she heard the\r\nPresident say anything?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. My memory isn't good for that. I don't remember what Mrs.\r\nConnally told me on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you continuing to treat Governor Connally at the\r\npresent time?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, although the treatment of the chest is practically at an\r\nend, because the chest has reached a satisfactory state of healing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you continue to treat the Governor all during his stay\r\nat Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, I attended him several times daily.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, would you think it consistent with the facts\r\nthat you know as to Governor Connally's wounds that he could have been\r\nstruck by the same bullet which passed through President Kennedy,\r\nassuming that a missile with the muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per\r\nsecond, a 6.5-millimeter bullet, passed through President Kennedy at a\r\ndistance of 160 to 250 feet from the rifle, passing through President\r\nKennedy's body, entering on his back and striking only soft tissue and\r\nexiting on his neck; could that missile have also gone through Governor\r\nConnally's chest in your opinion?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, taking your description of the first wound sustained by\r\nthe President, which I, myself, did not observe, and considering the\r\nposition of the two men in the limousine, I think it would be perfectly\r\npossible for the first bullet to have passed through the soft tissues\r\nof the neck of President Kennedy and produced the wounds that we found\r\non Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could that bullet then have produced all the wounds that\r\nyou found on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, I would still be postulating that Governor Connally was\r\nstruck by one missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as you sit here at the moment on your postulation\r\nthat Governor Connally was struck by one missile, is that in a way\r\nwhich is depicted by diagram No. 5 on the exhibit heretofore marked as\r\n\"Dr. Gregory's Exhibit No. 1?\"\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I feel that the line of trajectory as marked on this\r\ndiagram is accurate as it could be placed from my memory of this wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, on that trajectory, how do you postulate the bullet\r\nthen passed through the wrist from dorsal to volar or from volar to\r\ndorsal?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. My postulation would be from volar to dorsal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, then, going back to diagram No. 1, Dr. Shaw, there is\r\none factor that we did not call your attention to or have you testify\r\nabout, and that is--the marking that the exit is on the volar side and\r\nthe entry is on the dorsal side as it was remarked by Dr. Gregory, that\r\nwould then be inconsistent of your view of the situation, would it not?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes, it would be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And similarly on diagram No. 3, where the exit is marked\r\non the volar, and the entry is marked on the dorsal, that would also be\r\ninconsistent with your view of the situation?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes--he has the wound on the back being quite a bit larger\r\nthan the wound on the front here, doesn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, the wound as it appears here on the diagram is larger.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. That wasn't my memory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But I don't think that that is necessarily as to scale in\r\nthis situation. Would it be possible from your knowledge of the facts\r\nhere, Dr. Shaw, that President Kennedy might have been struck by the\r\nbullet passing through him, hitting nothing but soft tissues, and that\r\nbullet could have passed through Governor Connally's chest and a second\r\nbullet might have struck Governor Connally's wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; this is a perfectly tenable theory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, then, the damage to Governor Connally's thigh might\r\nhave come from either of the bullets which passed through the chest or\r\na second bullet which struck the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. That is true--as far as the wounds are concerned, this\r\ntheory, I feel, is tenable. It doesn't conform to the description of\r\nthe sequence of the events as described by Mrs. Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what respect Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Well she feels that the Governor was only struck by one\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why does she feel that way; do you know, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. As soon as he was struck she pushed him to the bottom of\r\nthe car and got on top of him and it would mean that there would be a\r\nperiod of--well if there were 5-1/2 seconds between the three shots,\r\nthere would be a couple seconds there that would have given her time\r\nto get him down into the car, and as she describes the sequence, it is\r\nhard to see how he could have been struck by a second bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If she pushed him down immediately after he was shot on\r\nthe first occasion?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But if her reaction was not that fast so that he was\r\nstruck twice, of course then there would be a different situation,\r\ndepending entirely on how fast she reacted.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I think if he had been struck first in the wrist and not\r\nstruck in the chest, he would have known that. He only remembers the\r\nhard blow to the back of his chest and doesn't remember being struck in\r\nthe wrist at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Might he not have been struck in the chest first and\r\nstruck by a subsequent shot in the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; but that's hard to postulate if he was down in the\r\nbottom of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, have you been interviewed by any representatives\r\nof the Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who talked to you about this case?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I don't have his name. I perhaps could find it. It was a\r\nmember of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions were you talked to by a Secret\r\nService man?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you tell him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I told him approximately the same that has been told in this\r\ntranscript.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And prior to the time we started to go on the record with\r\nthe court reporter taking this down verbatim, did you and I have a\r\ndiscussion about the purpose of the deposition and the questions that I\r\nwould ask you?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were the answers which you provided me at that time\r\nthe same as those which you have testified to on the record here this\r\nafternoon?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any other written record of the operation on\r\nGovernor Connally other than that which has been identified here in\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 392?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No; this is a copy of the operative record that went on to\r\nthe chart of Governor Connally which is in the possession of the record\r\nroom of Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything else which you could tell us which\r\nyou think might be helpful to the Commission in any way, Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No; I believe that we have covered all of the points that\r\nare germane to this incident. Anything else that I would have would\r\nactually be hearsay.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, sir, for appearing.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. All right, you are welcome.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shaw, permit me to ask you one or two more questions.\r\nDid you find any bullets in Governor Connally's body?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you find any fragments of bullets in his chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. No; only fragments of shattered rib.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you find, or do you know whether any fragment was\r\nfound in his wrist or the quantity of fragments in his wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. It is my understanding that only foreign material from the\r\nsuit of Governor Connally was found in the wrist, although in the X-ray\r\nof the wrist there appeared to be some minute metallic fragments in the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to the wound on the back of Governor Connally, was\r\nthere any indication that the bullet was tumbling prior to the time it\r\nstruck him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. I would only have to say that I'm not a ballistics expert,\r\nbut the wound on his chest was not a single puncture wound, it was long\r\nenough so that there might have been some tumbling.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean the wound on his back?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The wound on his back--yes, it was long enough so that there\r\nmight have been some tumbling. In other words, it was not a spherical\r\npuncture wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So it might have had some tumbling involved, or it might\r\nnot have?\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; I don't know whether the clothes would have occasioned\r\nthis or not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. My question would be that perhaps some tumbling might have\r\nbeen involved as a result of decrease in velocity as the bullet passed\r\nthrough President Kennedy, whether there was any indication from the\r\nsurface of the wound which would indicate tumbling.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. The wound entrance was an elliptical wound. In other words,\r\nit had a long diameter and a short diameter. It didn't have the\r\nappearance of a wound caused by a high velocity bullet that had not\r\nstruck anything else; in other words, a puncture wound.\r\n\r\nNow, you have to also take into consideration, however, whether the\r\nbullet enters at a right angle or at a tangent. If it enters at a\r\ntangent there will be some length to the wound of entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, would you say in net that there could have been some\r\ntumbling occasioned by having it pass through another body or perhaps\r\nthe oblique character of entry might have been occasioned by the angle\r\nof entry.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Yes; either would have explained a wound of entry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine, thank you very much, Doctor.\r\n\r\nDr. SHAW. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. CHARLES FRANCIS GREGORY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Charles Francis Gregory was taken at 2:30 p.m.,\r\non March 23, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that at the start of this session that\r\nI have here at the moment Dr. Charles Gregory, who has appeared here in\r\nresponse to a letter of request from the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMay I say to you, Dr. Gregory, that the purpose of the Commission is\r\nto investigate all facets relating to the assassination, including the\r\nwounding of President Kennedy, and the wounding of Governor Connally,\r\nand we have asked you to appear here for the purpose of testifying\r\nconcerning your treatment of Governor Connally. Our rules specify that\r\nwe make a brief statement of the purpose of the Commission, and the\r\npurpose of our calling on you.\r\n\r\nNow, will you stand up and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth,\r\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Dr. Charles Francis Gregory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I am a physician and surgeon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline your educational background, please?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes; I received a bachelor of science degree from Indiana\r\nUniversity in 1941, and a doctor of medicine in 1944. I have completed\r\n5 years of post-graduate training in orthopedic surgery at the Indiana\r\nUniversity Medical Center in 1951. I remained there excepting for an\r\ninterlude with the U.S. Navy in 1953 and 1954, until 1956. In 1956 I\r\nassumed my present position, which is that of professor of orthopedic\r\nsurgery and chairman of the division of orthopedic surgery at the\r\nSouthwestern Medical School, University of Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory, are you certified by the American Board?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I am certified by the American Board of Orthopedic\r\nSurgery; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year were you so certified?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In 1953. I am now a member of the American Board of\r\nOrthopedic Surgery, as a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory, what experience, if any, have you had in the\r\ntreatment of gunshot wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. My experience with the treatment of gunshot wounds began\r\nwith my training in orthopedic surgery, but its greatest impetus\r\noccurred in 1953 and 1954 in the Korean theatre of operations with the\r\nU.S. Navy. Since that time here at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas our\r\nservice has attended a considerable number of such injuries, plus my\r\nexperience is continuing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you approximate the total number of gunshot wounds\r\nyou have had experience with?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I have had personal experience with, I suppose, in\r\napproximately 500 such missile wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory, back on November 22, 1963, did you have\r\noccasion to treat Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your\r\ncall to treat the Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I had been seeing patients in the health service at the\r\nmedical school building on the morning of November 22 and was there\r\nwhen word was received that the President had been shot. I did not then\r\nknow that the Governor had also been injured. I came to the emergency\r\nroom of Parkland Hospital and upon gaining entrance to it, inquired\r\nas to whether or not Mr. Kennedy's wounds were of a nature that would\r\nrequire my assistance.\r\n\r\nI was advised that they were not. I then took a number of persons from\r\nthe emergency room area with me away from it in order to reduce the\r\nconfusion, and I went to the orthopedic ward on the fifth floor west of\r\nParkland Hospital. After attending some of the patients on that ward,\r\nI was preparing to leave the hospital and went by the operating room\r\narea to see whether or not I could be of any other assistance, and\r\nwas apprised then that a page was out for me. At that time Dr. Shaw\r\nadvised me that Governor Connally had been wounded and that among his\r\nwounds were those to the right forearm and the left thigh. He had asked\r\nthat I stay and attend those wounds after he had completed care of the\r\nGovernor's chest wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time did you have that conversation\r\nwith Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. To the best of my knowledge, that conversation must have\r\nbeen about between 1 and 1:15 in the afternoon of November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that conversation was with Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Dr. Robert Shaw.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what part did Dr. Robert Shaw have in the treatment\r\nof Governor Connally in a general way?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, Dr. Robert Shaw attended the most serious wound that\r\nthe Governor sustained, which was one to his right chest, and it was\r\nhis operation which took precedence over all others.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, was that operation completed before your operation\r\ncommenced?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes; Dr. Shaw's operation had been completed before we\r\neven arranged the Governor's right arm and left thigh for definitive\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At approximately what time did your operation of Governor\r\nConnally begin?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. My operation on Governor Connally began about 4 o'clock\r\np.m. on Friday, November 22.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And approximately how long did it last?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. The better part of an hour--I should judge--45 to 50\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who, if anyone, assisted you in that operation?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I was assisted by the junior orthopedic resident, Dr.\r\nWilliam Osborne, and the orthopedic intern, Dr. John Parker.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was Governor Connally's condition when you first saw\r\nhim with respect to his chest wounds, first, if you will, please tell\r\nus?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I did not see Governor Connally myself until he had been\r\ntaken into the operating room and had had an endotracheal tube placed\r\nin his larynx and had been anesthetized. Having accomplished this, the\r\nvery precarious mechanics of respiration had been corrected and his\r\ngeneral status at that time was quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What observations did you have with respect to his wound\r\nin the chest?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I had none, really, for the business of prepping and\r\ndraping was underway at that time, and I did not intrude other than to\r\nobserve very casually, and I don't remember any details of it.\r\n\r\nNow, I did see in the course of the operation the wound in his chest,\r\nthe wound of entry, and its posterior surface and the wound of exit on\r\nthe anterior surface.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the wound of entry look like, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. It appeared to me that the wound of entry was sort of\r\na linear wound, perhaps three-quarters of an inch in length with a\r\nrounded central portion. Whereas, the wound of exit was rather larger\r\nthan this, perhaps an inch and a half across.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at approximately what part of the body was the wound\r\nthat you described as the wound of entry?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In view of the drapes that were on the Governor at the\r\ntime, I will have to speculate, but as I recall best, it was in an area\r\nprobably 2 inches below and medial to the right nipple.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the wound of entry or exit?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. That's the wound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the wound of entry?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. The wound of entry was too obscure for me to identify,\r\nsince it was just in general over the posterior aspect of his chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe with respect to the wound of his\r\nwrist?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I didn't see the wound of his wrist until after the chest\r\noperation had been completed, because his arm was covered by the\r\noperation drapes, the surgical drapes for the chest procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you did have an opportunity to observe the wound\r\nof the wrist, what did you then see?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I observed the wound on the dorsal aspect of his wrist,\r\nwhich was about 2 cm. in length, ragged, somewhat irregular, and lay\r\nabout an inch and a half or 2 inches above the wrist joint. It was a\r\nlittle to the radial side of the wrist area.\r\n\r\nThere was a second wound in the wrist on the volar surface, about a\r\ncentimeter and a half proximal to the distal flexion crease and this\r\nwound was a transverse laceration no more than a centimeter in length\r\nand did not gape.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say on the dorsal aspect, what is that?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In lay terms, that's equivalent to the back of the hand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the volar is equivalent to what?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. The palm surface of the hand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What conclusion, if any, did you reach as to which was the\r\nwound of entry and exit on the wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Based on certain findings in the wound at the time the\r\ndebridement was carried out----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you define debridement before you proceed with that?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes; debridement is a surgical term used to designate\r\nthat procedure in attending a wound which removes by sharp excision\r\nall nonvital tissue in the area together with any identifiable foreign\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nIn attending this wound, it was evident early that clot had been\r\ncarried into the wound from the dorsal surface to the bone and into the\r\nfracture. This would imply that an irregular missile had passed through\r\nthe wrist from the dorsal to the volar aspect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, were there any characteristics in the volar aspect\r\nwhich would indicate that it was a wound of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. No; there were none, really. It was my assumption that the\r\nmissile had expended much of its remaining energy in passing through\r\nthe radius bone, which it did before it could emerge through the soft\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any foreign objects identifiable as bits\r\nof fragments or portions of a bullet missile?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. A preliminary X-ray had indicated that there were metallic\r\nfragments or at least metallic fragments which cast metallic shadows\r\nin the soft tissues around the wounded forearm. Two or three of these\r\nwere identified and were recovered and were observed to be metallic\r\nin consistency. These were turned over to appropriate authorities for\r\nfurther disposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately how large were those fragments, Dr. Gregory?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I would judge that they were first--flat, rather thin, and\r\nthat their greatest dimension would probably not exceed one-eighth of\r\nan inch. They were very small.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have sufficient experience with gunshot wounds\r\nto comment as to whether a 6.5-mm. bullet could have passed through the\r\nGovernor's wrist in the way you have described, leaving the fragments\r\nwhich you have described and still have virtually all the bullet\r\nmissile intact, or having 158 grains of a bullet at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, I am not an expert on ballistics, but one cannot\r\nescape certain ballistic implications in this business.\r\n\r\nI would say, first of all, that how much of the missile remains intact\r\nas a mass depends to some extent on how hard the metal is. Obviously,\r\nif it is very soft, as lead, it may lose more fragments and therefore\r\nmore weight and volume than it might if it is made of a harder material\r\nor is jacketed in some way.\r\n\r\nNow, the energy in the missile is a product, not so much of its mass as\r\nit is of its velocity, for by doubling the velocity, you can increase\r\nthe kinetic energy in the force it transmits, fourfold, since the\r\nformula for determining energy in these cases is a matter of mass times\r\nvelocity squared, rather than just linear functional velocity. So, some\r\nknowledge of how much of the cartridge force might have been behind the\r\nmissile would be useful here too.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the purpose of this consideration, I am interested\r\nto know the the metal which you found in the wrist was of sufficient\r\nsize so that the bullet which passed through the wrist could not have\r\nemerged virtually completely intact or with 158 grains intact, or\r\nwhether the portions of the metallic fragments were so small that that\r\nwould be consistent with having virtually the entire 6.5-mm. bullet\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, considering the small volume of metal as seen by\r\nX-ray, and the very small dimensions of the metal which was recovered,\r\nI think several such fragments could have been flaked off of a total\r\nmissile mass without reducing its volume greatly.\r\n\r\nNow, just how much, depends of course upon what the original missile\r\nweighed. In other words, on the basis of the metal left behind in\r\nGovernor Connally's body, as far as I could tell, the missile that\r\nstruck it could be virtually intact, insofar as mass was concerned, but\r\nprobably was distorted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have any idea at all as to what the fragments\r\nwhich you observed in the Governor's wrist might weigh, Doctor?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. No, not really, but it would have been very small--very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What treatment or action did you take with respect to\r\ntreating the Governor's wrist for him, Dr. Gregory?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Upon completing the debridement, we were then faced with a\r\ndecision as to whether we should suture his wound in the conventional\r\nmanner or not, and we chose not to, leaving the wound open in deference\r\nto potential infection that might be produced by retained fragments\r\nof clothing. Having decided upon that course of action, the fractured\r\nradius bone was then manipulated into a reduced position and the entire\r\nlimb was encased in a plaster-paris cast.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did that complete your operative procedure?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. That completed my operative procedure for that day for\r\nGovernor Connally--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What other wounds, if any, did you notice on the Governor\r\nat that time?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In addition to the chest wound and the wound just\r\ndescribed in his right forearm there was a wound in the medical aspect\r\nof his left thigh. This was almost round and did not seem to have\r\ndisturbed the tissues badly, but did definitely penetrate and pass\r\nthrough the skin and to the fascia beneath. I could not tell from the\r\nsuperficial inspection whether it had passed through the fascia. An\r\nX-ray was made of his thigh at that time and there was not present in\r\nhis thigh any missile of sufficient magnitude, in my opinion, to have\r\nproduced the wound observed on his medial aspect. Repeat X-rays failed\r\nto reveal any such missile and an additional examination failed to\r\nreveal any wound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the X-rays reveal with respect to the presence of\r\na missile?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In the thigh there was a very small shadow, perhaps 1 mm.\r\nby 2 mm. in dimension, lying close to the medial aspect of the femur,\r\nthat is, the thigh bone, but was in my opinion much too small to have\r\naccounted for the dimensions of the wound on the medial aspect of his\r\nthigh or a wound of that character.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the dimensions of the wound on the medial aspect\r\nof his thigh.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I would say that that wound was about a centimeter in\r\ndiameter, much larger than the identifiable fragment of metal in the\r\nthigh. I might add that this prompted some speculation on our part, my\r\npart, which was voiced to someone that some search ought to be made in\r\nthe Governor's clothing or perhaps in the auto or some place, wherever\r\nhe may have been, for the missile which had produced this much damage\r\nbut which was not resident in him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what type of a missile would it have taken\r\nto produce a wound which you have described on his thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, it would take a fragment of metal of approximately\r\nthe same diameter--a centimeter, and in general--round.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that correspond with the measurement of a 6.5-mm.\r\nmissile?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I will have to guess--I don't know what dimension--of a\r\n6.5-mm.--yes, a 6.5-mm. would be .65 cm., approximately, yes, that\r\ncould have very well have occurred from such a missile, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory. I now show you two typewritten pages which\r\nare a portion of a document identified as Commission Exhibit No. 392,\r\nwhich in its total aspect constitutes all of the medical records from\r\nParkland Hospital on President Kennedy and Governor Connally and the\r\ntwo pages to which I direct your attention relate an operation on\r\nGovernor Connally, where you are listed as the surgeon, and I ask\r\nyou if you will take a minute and look those over and tell us whether\r\nor not that is your report on the operation which you have just been\r\ndescribing.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. (Examining instrument referred to.) Yes, this appears to\r\nbe the essence of the report which I dictated at the conclusion of my\r\noperation on Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts contained in this report the same as\r\nthose to which you have testified here today?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I think they are--I hope so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you describe in a general way what treatment you\r\nhave given Governor Connally following the time when you completed this\r\nreport on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. The Governor remained in Parkland Hospital for some 2\r\nweeks after his admission. On the 5th day after the operation, in the\r\nGovernor's hospital room, the wound on the dorsal surface of his wrist\r\nwas closed by wire sutures and this was carried out in the room. On\r\nthe 10th day, I believe it was, the 10th day from injury, the Governor\r\nwas taken back to the operating room and there under a light general\r\nanesthesia, his wounds were dressed and inspected, and a new plaster of\r\nparis cast was applied at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Governor was then permitted up and about with his arm in a sling,\r\nand shortly thereafter returned to the Governor's Mansion in Austin.\r\nI visited Governor Connally in the Governor's Mansion in Austin about\r\n1 week after his discharge from the hospital, simply for check-up\r\nexamination and I found things to be in a satisfactory state.\r\n\r\nI saw the Governor again about 1 month after his discharge, in\r\nthe office of Dr. Robert A. Dennison in Austin, Tex., and another\r\nexamination this time, including an X-ray, was made, and again\r\nthe condition of his right forearm and of the fractured bone were\r\nconsidered to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nNow, I've got to think of the next date--off of the record or on as you\r\nwish--\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, we will go off of the record, Doctor, while you\r\nare thinking that through.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. All right.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the Witness Gregory off the\r\nrecord.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, Dr. Gregory.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I'll say on or about February 14, the Governor came to\r\nDallas and on that occasion we removed his cast, obtained an X-ray,\r\nfound his fracture to be healing satisfactorily, and so we applied a\r\nnew cast. The Governor wore that cast until 1 week ago, when he again\r\ncame to Dallas. The cast was removed, and X-ray revealed satisfactory\r\nhealing of his fracture, and the cast, as a continuous form of\r\ntreatment, was discontinued.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Governor is on a regiment of exercises, and he\r\nwears a demountable splint, whenever it looks as though the electorate\r\nmay be over enthusiastic by shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you anticipate any future cast for Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I anticipate probably an uneventful, though slow, recovery\r\nof normal function in his right arm and wrist and hand.\r\n\r\nI think he will have some permanent impairment, but I think he will\r\nhave a very minimal amount of disability, and I do not at this time\r\nanticipate any need for any further surgical intervention. That\r\nwill have to become manifest by the appearance of some other as yet\r\nunanticipated symptom.\r\n\r\nI would like to add that on each of the examination interviews here in\r\nDallas, the Governor was also checked over by Dr. Robert Shaw, from the\r\npoint of view of recovery from his chest wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory, I now show you a series of diagrams which are\r\na part of reports bearing Commission No. 326 and may the record show\r\nthese differ from Commission Exhibit numbers, reflecting the number\r\nassigned to reports.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask the Court Reporter to mark this particular copy as\r\nDr. Gregory's Exhibit No. 1.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the Reporter as Dr. Gregory's Exhibit No. 1, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I am going to ask you, pointing first to Diagram No. 1,\r\nwhether or not this accurately depicts the wounds of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. This one does not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what respect?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. In the respect that the wound of entry is shown to exist\r\non the volar surface of the forearm, whereas, it was on the dorsal\r\nsurface of the forearm in my view--in my opinion--and the reverse holds\r\nfor the wound of exit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you take my pen and correct those as they should be,\r\nDoctor Gregory?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. (Complied with request of Counsel Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, turning to Exhibit, Diagram No. 2 on this exhibit,\r\nand calling your attention specifically to the point of entry and the\r\npoint of exit on the diagram of a man standing, does that correspond\r\nwith the angle of declination on Governor Connally's wound?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. To the best of my knowledge, this would fairly accurately\r\ndepict that angle. If I were to have any reservation at all, it would\r\nbe with reference to the height or the position of the wounds of entry,\r\nas being marked a little high, but this is recalling from memory, and\r\nit may not be correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now call your attention to Diagram No. 3 on this\r\nsequence and ask if this accurately depicts the condition of the\r\nGovernor's wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I think that this one comes more closely into line with\r\ntheir actual location, especially with reference to the wound of entry\r\nin the posterior aspect of the chest. It is a little lower here, as I\r\nrecall it to be. Those of the wrist, I think are accurately depicted,\r\nand that of the thigh are believed to be accurately depicted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And on these wrist wounds, do they show the point of entry\r\nto be on the dorsal aspect and the point of exit to be on the volar\r\naspect?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. According to the anatomical position, I believe that they\r\ndo; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, looking at Diagram No. 4, does this again correspond\r\nwith your recollection of the angle of decline on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Again, if I have a reservation it would be to the wound of\r\nentry and the posterior aspect as being shown a little higher than it\r\nactually existed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Dr. Gregory, I turn to Diagram No. 5, which depicts a\r\nseated man and what does Diagram No. 5 depict to your eye with respect\r\nto what action is described on the seated man?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, I should say that this composite has alined the\r\nseveral parts of the body demonstrated in such a way that a single\r\nmissile following a constant trajectory could have accounted for all of\r\nthe wounds which are shown.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this is consistent with the point of entry which is depicted\r\non the side views showing the angle of declination. I submit that\r\nthe angle of declination in passing through the chest could be very\r\nsimply altered by having an individual lean forward a few degrees,\r\nand similarly could be made much deeper by having him lean backward,\r\nwithout really changing the basic relationship between the parts, nor\r\nin any way affecting the likelihood that all parts could have come into\r\nthis same trajectory.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you consider it possible, in your professional\r\nopinion, for the same bullet to have inflicted all of the wounds which\r\nyou have described on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes; I believe it very possible, for a number of reasons.\r\nOne of these--is the apparent loss of energy manifested at each of the\r\nvarious body surfaces, which I transected, the greatest energy being\r\nat the point of entry on the posterior aspect of the chest and of\r\nthe fifth rib, where considerable destruction was done and the least\r\ndestruction having been done in the medial aspect of the thigh where\r\nthe bullet apparently expended itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What destruction was done on the fifth rib, Dr. Gregory?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. It is my understanding from conversations with Dr. Shaw,\r\nand I believe his medical reports bear this out, that the fifth rib was\r\nliterally shattered by the missile.\r\n\r\nWe know that high velocity bullets striking bone have a strong tendency\r\nto shatter bones and the degree to which the fifth rib was shattered\r\nwas considerably in excess of the amount of shattering which occurred\r\nin the radius--the forearm.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what conclusion, if any, did you draw as to the\r\nvelocity of the missile, as to the time it struck each of those bony\r\nportions?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I think that the missile was continually losing velocity\r\nwith each set of tissues which it encountered and transected, and the\r\namount of damage done is progressively less from first entrance in the\r\nthorax to the last entrance in the thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think it possible that Governor Connally was shot\r\nby two bullets, with one hitting in the posterior part of his body and\r\nthe second one striking the back side of his wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. The possibility exists, but I would discount it for these\r\nreasons--ordinarily, a missile in flight--I'll qualify that--a high\r\nvelocity missile in flight does not tend to carry organic material into\r\nthe wound which it creates.\r\n\r\nI believe if you will inspect the record which was prepared by Dr.\r\nShaw, there is no indication that any clothing or other organic\r\nmaterial was found in the chest wound.\r\n\r\nAn irregular missile can carry debris into a wound and such debris was\r\ncarried into the wound of the wrist.\r\n\r\nI would have expected that an undistorted high velocity missile\r\nstriking the wrist would not have carried material into it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other characteristic which led and leads you\r\nto conclude that the wrist was not the initial point of impact of a\r\nsingle high velocity bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes. Based on our experience with high velocity missile\r\nwounds of the forearm produced by rifles of the deer hunting\r\ncalibre, there is tremendous soft tissue destruction as well as bone\r\nfragmentation which not infrequently culminates in amputation of the\r\npart.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the missile wound in Governor Connally's right\r\nforearm was produced by a missile of such magnitude at the time it\r\nstruck him. It either had to be one of lower initial energy or a\r\nmissile which had been partially expended elsewhere before it struck\r\nhis wrist.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that opinion apply if you assumed that the missile\r\nhad initial velocity when leaving the muzzle of the weapon of 200 feet\r\nper second?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. That's not a very high velocity missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me--2,000 feet per second.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I should say that a missile at 2,000 feet per second that\r\nstrikes the forearm is likely to blow it very nearly off, if it is a\r\nmissile of any mass as well.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, assume that you have a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet\r\nper second and assume the mass is 6.5 mm., and assume further that the\r\ndistance between the muzzle and the wrist is approximately 160 to 250\r\nfeet away, what would you expect, based on your experience, that the\r\nconsequences would be on that wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I will have to say that most of the high velocity rifle\r\nwounds that I have seen of the forearm have, in fact, been at a closer\r\nrange than that which you have stipulated, but I doubt that a range of\r\n155 or 200 feet would seriously reduce the energy, and I would expect a\r\nsimilar wound, under the circumstances which you have described.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me add another possibility in this sequence, Dr.\r\nGregory, and ask you your opinion with respect to an additional\r\nintervening victim in the path of the same bullet to this\r\neffect--assume that President Kennedy was riding in an open automobile\r\ndirectly behind Governor Connally, and that at a distance of\r\napproximately 175 feet President Kennedy was struck by a bullet from\r\na weapon with a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second, carrying a\r\n6.5 mm. missile and that the missile entered in the upper right of\r\nthe President's back very near the neckline and passed through his\r\nbody, striking no bony material, and emerged from the throat of the\r\nPresident. Is it possible that missile could have then entered the back\r\nof the Governor and inflicted the chest wound which you have described?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I would have to concede that that would be possible--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would your professional opinion be, if you can\r\nformulate one, as to whether or not that actually did happen in this\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I really couldn't formulate an objective opinion about\r\nit. Only, for this reason, that it would then become a question simply\r\nof trajectories, and lining the two bodies up in such a way that this\r\nsequence of events could have occurred. I would hazard one guess, that\r\nis, that had the missile that struck Governor Connally passed through\r\nPresident Kennedy first, that though the missile would not have been\r\ndistorted necessarily, it would very probably have begun to tumble.\r\nNow, if you like, I will define that for you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you please?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. A tumbling is a second--it actually is a third component\r\nof motion that a missile may go through in its trajectory. First,\r\nthere is a linear motion from muzzle to target on point of impact. In\r\norder to keep a missile on its path, there is imparted to it a rotary\r\nmotion so that it is spinning. Now, both of these are commensurate with\r\nthe constant trajectory. A third component, which is tumbling, and is\r\nliterally the end over end motion, which may be imparted to a missile\r\nshould it strike something in flight that deflects but does not stop\r\nit--in this circumstance the wound of entry created by such a missile\r\nusually is quite large and the destruction it creates is increased, as\r\na matter of fact, by such tumbling, and I would have therefore expected\r\nto see perhaps some organic material carried into a large wound of\r\nentry in Governor Connally's back.\r\n\r\nThese are only theoretical observations, but these are some of the\r\nreasons why I would believe that the missile in the Governor behaved as\r\nthough it had never struck anything except him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe the nature of the wound in the Governor's\r\nback?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Only so far as I saw it as Dr. Shaw was preparing to\r\noperate on it, but I was unable to see the nature of the wound as he\r\ncarried out his operation. I did, however, specifically question him\r\nabout this matter of containing foreign material, clothing, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did he say about that?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Well, as I recall it, he said none was found, and I would\r\nnot have expected any to be found as I explained to you, if this was\r\nthe initial impact of that missile.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, wouldn't you think it possible, bearing in mind that\r\nmy last question only went as to whether the same bullet could have\r\ngone through President Kennedy and inflicted the wound on Governor\r\nConnolly's chest, would you think it possible that the same missile\r\ncould have gone through President Kennedy in the way I described and\r\nhave inflicted all three of the wounds, that is, the entry and exit\r\non the chest, the entry and exit on the wrist, and the entry into the\r\nthigh which you described.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. I suspect it's possible, but I would say it would have to\r\nbe a remarkably powerful missile to have done so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Gregory, have you been interviewed about this matter\r\nprior to today by any representative of the Federal Government?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes; on two or three occasions I have talked to a properly\r\nidentified member of the Secret Service, Mr. Warren, I believe it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the nature of the information which you gave\r\nto Mr. Warren on those occasions?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Essentially the same thing as I have told you here, but in\r\nmuch less detail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you ever talked to anyone besides Mr. Warren and\r\nme about these matters, from the Federal Government?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. No; not that I know of. I was on a day or so after the\r\nassassination spoken to in these offices by a member of the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation, but it was a very brief interview.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was that about?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. And I think it was the question of whether or not I had\r\nbeen able to recover any metal from Governor Connally which they might\r\nuse for ballistic analysis.\r\n\r\nI regret to say I don't know the gentleman's name, but he too was\r\nproperly identified.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And prior to the time when the Court Reporter started to\r\ntranscribe the deposition which you have been kind enough to provide us\r\nwith, had you and I been talking about the same subjects which you have\r\nanswered questions on all during the course of this deposition?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And during the time that you first were interviewed by the\r\nSecret Service down through the present moment, have you had the same\r\ngeneral opinion concerning the matters which you have testified about\r\nhere today?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think would be\r\nhelpful in any way to the work of the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. No; not really. This is the only articulation I have had\r\nwith this whole episode concerning Governor Connally's wound and his\r\nsubsequent recovery and none other.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Gregory, for coming.\r\n\r\nDr. GREGORY. Very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. GEORGE T. SHIRES\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. George T. Shires was taken at 4:35 p.m., on March\r\n23, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that as we are reconvening this\r\nsession and about to commence the deposition of Dr. George T. Shires,\r\nthat the preliminary statement is being made that this is pursuant\r\nto the investigation being conducted by the President's Commission\r\non the Assassination of President Kennedy to determine all the facts\r\nrelating to the shooting, including the treatment rendered to Governor\r\nConnally as well as President Kennedy, and that Dr. Shires has appeared\r\nhere today in response to a letter of request from the President's\r\nCommission to testify concerning his knowledge of the treatment which\r\nhe and other medical personnel at Parkland Hospital performed on\r\nGovernor Connally.\r\n\r\nWill you rise, please, Dr. Shires and raise your right hand. Do you\r\nsolemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the President's\r\nCommission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name, please, for the record?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. George Thomas Shires.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your profession, sir?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department of\r\nSurgery, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical School.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you are a medical doctor by profession, I assume?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; M.D.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you outline briefly your educational background?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Undergraduate education at the University of Texas in\r\nAustin, Tex.; graduate medical education at the University of Texas,\r\nSouthwestern Medical School in Dallas; internship, Massachusetts\r\nMemorial Hospital in Boston, Mass.; surgical residency--Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital in Dallas, Tex.; two tours of active duty in the\r\nUnited States Navy, first as research investigator at the Naval\r\nMedical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda,\r\nMd.; second as Associate Surgeon, United States Naval Hospital Ship\r\n_Haven_--do you want staff positions?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Please, give me those, as well.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Subsequently, Clinical Instructor in Surgery, University\r\nof Texas, Southwestern Medical School, progressing through Assistant\r\nProfessor of Surgery, Associate Professor of Surgery, Professor of\r\nSurgery, and Chairman of the Department of Surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your year of graduation from college, Dr. Shires?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. This was premedical, and at that time the war was on, so it\r\nwas a premedical 3 years--it was 1944.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year did you receive your medical degree?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you Board certified at the present time?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, in what year were you so certified?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I was certified by the American Board of Surgery in 1956.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render any medical treatment for\r\nPresident Kennedy back on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; I was not in town at the time the shooting occurred.\r\nI was in Galveston, Tex., at the meeting of the Western Surgical\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render medical attention and\r\nservices to Governor Connally, Dr. Shires?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state briefly the circumstances under which you\r\nwere called into this case?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. After the President and the Governor were brought to\r\nParkland Hospital, it was determined--well--all aid was given to the\r\nPresident that was available, and it was determined that Governor\r\nConnally's injuries were multiple, the primary injury to Governor\r\nConnally was to the chest.\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw, who is the professor of surgery--I don't need to tell their\r\ntitles--you will have all that?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes--correct.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Dr. Shaw ascertained the condition of Governor Connally,\r\ninstituted therapy, and had the hospital notify me in Galveston of the\r\nstatus of the President and also the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to return then to Dallas in time to assist\r\nin the operative procedures on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at approximately what time did you return to Dallas?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Approximately 3 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what participation did you have in the operative\r\nprocedures on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. At the time I returned, the chest procedure was in\r\nprogress. The orthopedic procedure on the arm and the leg debridement\r\nwere ready to be started. I scrubbed and performed the leg procedure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe, if anything, as to the condition of\r\nGovernor Connally's chest wound?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. At the time I arrived, the chest wound had been debrided\r\nand was being closed. His general condition at that point was very\r\ngood. He was receiving blood and the arm and leg wounds were being\r\nprepared for surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe the wound on his\r\nback?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Not at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any opportunity to observe a wound on his\r\nchest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Once again, not at that time--later, but not at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, what did you observe at a later time concerning the\r\nwound on his back and on his chest?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Well, in part of his postoperative care, which was a large\r\npart of the treatment, we were concerned, of course, with all the\r\nwounds, and he had several chest wounds. These, at the time I saw them,\r\nhad been debrided and were the site of draining, so that their initial\r\nappearance was completely altered by having had surgical debridement,\r\nso they were clean postsurgical wounds with drainage, at the time I\r\nfirst saw them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would their alteration and condition preclude you from\r\ngiving an opinion as to whether they were points of entry or points of\r\nexit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. They would--really.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe at the time you arrived at the\r\nhospital as to the condition of his wrist, if anything?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. At that point his wrist was being prepared for surgery, and\r\nalthough I did not examine this in detail, since I was concerned with\r\nthe thigh wound, there appeared to be a through and through wound of\r\nthe wrist which looked like a missile wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you able to formulate any opinion as to the point of\r\nentry or the point of exit?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; since I didn't examine it in detail; no, not really.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe as to the wound on the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. The wound on the thigh was a peculiar one. There was a 1\r\ncm. puncate missile wound over the junction of the middle and lower\r\nthird of the leg and the medial aspect of the thigh. The peculiarity\r\ncame in that the X-rays of the left leg showed only a very small 1 mm.\r\nbullet fragment imbedded in the femur of the left leg. Upon exploration\r\nof this wound, the other peculiarity was that there was very little\r\nsoft tissue damage, less than one would expect from an entrance wound\r\nof a centimeter in diameter, which was seen on the skin. So, it\r\nappeared, therefore, that the skin wound was either a tangential wound\r\nor that a larger fragment had penetrated or stopped in the skin and had\r\nsubsequently fallen out of the entrance wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What size fragment was there in the Governor's leg at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. We recovered none. The small one that was seen was on X-ray\r\nand it was still in the femur and being that small, with no tissue\r\ndamage after the debridement, it was thought inadvisable to remove this\r\nsmall fragment.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that fragment in the bone itself at the present time?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What would your best estimate be as to the size of that\r\nfragment?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. One millimeter in diameter--one to two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have any estimate as to how much that might\r\nweigh in grains?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. In grains--a fraction of a grain, maybe, a tenth of a\r\ngrain--very small.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A tenth of one grain?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What size bullet would it take to create the punctate hole\r\nwhich you described in the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. This would depend entirely on the angle and the speed and\r\nweight of the bullet. For example, a small missile on a tangent may\r\ncreate a surprisingly large defect. A large bullet with fast or a\r\nrelatively slow velocity will create the same defect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What operative procedures did you employ?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Progressive debridement from skin, fat, fascia, muscle,\r\nirrigation, and through and through enclosure with stainless steel\r\nalloy wire and removable sutures.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does that complete a general description of what you did\r\nto Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. In the operating room, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately what time did that operation start?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Approximately 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The operation that you were concerned with?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Oh, the operation that I was concerned with must have\r\nstarted at 3:30 or 4 o'clock, I guess it was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about what time did it end?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. My portion of it--about 20 minutes later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who, if anyone, assisted you in that portion of the\r\noperation?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Doctors Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph Don\r\nPatman.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shires, I am showing you a document identified\r\nheretofore as Commission Exhibit No. 392, which is the report of\r\nParkland Hospital on the treatment of President Kennedy and Governor\r\nConnally, and I show you a Parkland Memorial Hospital operative record,\r\ndated November 22, 1963, which lists you as the surgeon, and ask you\r\nwhether or not this represents the report made by you on the operative\r\nprocedures on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; it does.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, are those the same as the matters which you have\r\nheretofore described during the course of this deposition as to what\r\nyou did?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what treatment, if any, have you performed on\r\nGovernor Connally subsequent to November 22?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. A tremendous amount--postoperative care was of the\r\nessence here in that he had multiple injuries, massive blood and\r\nfluid replacement, so that to describe the care is really a detail of\r\npostoperative--I don't know how much of this you want--in other words,\r\nhe had clotting defects--I don't know whether you want to take this\r\ndown--I just want to ask you how much detail you would like?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Start off with a general description--perhaps, I will\r\ndirect your attention to some specific areas to abbreviate it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, how frequently did you see him after November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. For the first several days I saw him approximately every\r\n2 to 4 hours for an hour or so each visit, and many times for 6 and 8\r\nhours at a stretch.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And after that time how frequently did you see him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Decreasing frequency over the next 3 weeks--never less than\r\nthree or four times a day, even after he was convalescing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long was he in the hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I don't really know the number of days he was in the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After he left the hospital, have you seen him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; I saw him again approximately 2 weeks, I guess it\r\nwas, after he left the hospital, in Austin. He developed a superficial\r\nsaphenous thrombophlebitis in the right leg, not the one that the\r\ninjury occurred in. This was undoubtedly incident to a catheter cutdown\r\nhaving been placed in this leg for administration of blood and fluids\r\nwhile he was in the hospital. He unequivocably had a clot in the\r\nsaphenous vein and at this time was placed on bed rest, antibiotics,\r\nanticoagulants and responded very satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you anticipate seeing him in the future?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Do I?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Not for his wounds. No--the only followup care that he\r\nreally requires at the moment is the bone--the orthopedic followup,\r\nwhich incidentally is also completely healed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Doctor, look, if you will, at a document which we have\r\nmarked Dr. Gregory X-1, used in the course of the deposition of Dr.\r\nGregory, which immediately preceded yours and directing your attention\r\nfirst to Diagram Number 1, would the entry and exit holes on Governor\r\nConnally's back and chest, being entry and exit, respectively, and the\r\nexit and entry on the wrist with the entry being on the back side of\r\nthe wrist and the exit on the front side of the wrist, correspond with\r\nyour observations of Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; they would.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going to Diagram 2, which depicts a man standing,\r\nwould that correspond to the angle of the entry and exit wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going to Diagram No. 3, would that diagram correspond\r\nwith the wounds on Governor Connally as you recollect them to be?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Going now to Diagram 4, would that again correspond with\r\nthe wounds on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And as to Diagram No. 5, what does that represent?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. This, at the time of the discussion of Governor Connally's\r\ninjuries with his wife, before he really regained consciousness from\r\nsurgery, was the apparent position that he was in in the car, which\r\nwould explain one missile producing all three wounds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a discussion with Mrs. Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; with Mrs. Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when was that discussion?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Right after the surgery--this was the 22d, late in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, did she tell you as to the\r\nGovernor's position?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. She had thought, and I think correctly so, that he had\r\nturned to his right after he heard the first shot, apparently, to see\r\nwhat had happened to the President, and he then later confirmed this,\r\nthat he heard the first shot, turned to his right, and then was hit.\r\n\r\nI forgot about that a moment ago, incidentally. He definitely remembers\r\nturning after hearing the first shot, before he was struck with a\r\nbullet. I forgot about that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did Governor Connally tell you that?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Oh, several days later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While he was in the hospital?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Oh, yes--4 or 5 days later and we were constructing the\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the occasion for your conversation with him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. In part of his routine care one morning, as he was\r\nreconstructing his memory of events, because his memory was quite hazy,\r\nsince he had a sucking wound of the chest and came in here relatively\r\nin anoxia, he had some cyanosis, as you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is cyanosis?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Not enough oxygen of the tissues and this means they turn\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that affect his memory?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; sure would and did, and he remembers very little after\r\nhe fell over in the car--he is very hazy, until, oh, probably the\r\nsecond day post-operatively.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that affect his memory as to what happened before\r\nthe wound?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or, would that affect only his memory while he was\r\nsuffering from lack of oxygen?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Probably just while he was suffering from lack of oxygen.\r\nHe didn't have that much hypoxia. Hypoxia or anoxia or lack of oxygen\r\ncould affect his memory. Had this been severe, this could have affected\r\nhis memory for preceding events, but his hypoxia fortunately did not\r\nlast that long, and he never showed real evidence of brain damage from\r\nthe anoxia, so that I think his memory for events up until the time he\r\nrecalls falling over in the car is probably accurate.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you relate just as exactly as you can for us what he\r\nsaid to you, and the nature of the conversation, with your replies, and\r\nhow it went as closely as you can recount it now?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. He recounted, and as I remember this particular occasion,\r\nMrs. Connally was in the room too, and reconstructing events, she\r\nrelated the story of her last conversation with the President, relating\r\nto him, that the reception had been warm and that she was glad he\r\ncouldn't say that people of Texas and in Dallas didn't like him and\r\nadmire him, and she was very pleased with the way things had gone the\r\nwhole visit. Then, the next event that occurred was that she remembers\r\nhearing a shot, he remembered hearing a shot--he remembers turning to\r\nthe right, he remembered being struck by a bullet, and his next thought\r\nas he fell over toward his wife was \"They're going to kill all of us,\"\r\nand that's the last really clear memory that he expressed to me until\r\nhe remembers vaguely being in the emergency room, but very little of\r\nthat, and then he remembers waking up in the recovery room several\r\nhours later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he say anything to you about who he meant by \"they\"?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. He didn't say--he didn't comment on it at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he describe the nature of the sound which he heard?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I don't believe he did--no.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did anybody describe the nature of the sound?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I think Mrs. Connally did. I think she thought it was, if\r\nI'm not wrong, she thought it was a loud retort, either a gun or a\r\nfirecracker. I think she thought it was a bullet and I think he did\r\ntoo--thought it was a gun--I believe he did too.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did Governor Connally say anything about hearing\r\nPresident Kennedy say anything?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No--no, he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Mrs. Connally say anything about whether President\r\nKennedy said anything?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No, she didn't. She remembered Mrs. Kennedy saying some\r\nthings, but she didn't remember anything about the President having\r\nuttered a word.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did Mrs. Kennedy say, according to Mrs. Connally?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Oh, it's vague, even in my memory, but things to the effect\r\nthat her husband had been shot and--well, that was really the essence\r\nof it. It wasn't phrased that way.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Focusing on the time sequence--what did Governor Connally\r\nsay as to the timing, number one, the time he was hit, and number\r\ntwo, the time he had heard a sound, and number three, the time he\r\nturned--those three factors? In what sequence did he relate them?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. As he recalled it, he heard a shot, he turned to the right\r\nand felt himself receiving a shot--in that order--in a matter of a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did he feel himself receive a shot?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. In the right chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he make any comment about feeling anything in his\r\nwrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; I don't believe he did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about feeling anything in his thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I don't believe he ever commented on that to me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he say anything else to you at that time about his\r\nrecollections on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; other than this striking feeling he had after he\r\nwas hit, that someone was trying to kill all of them--apparently he\r\nremembers that quite clearly, right after he was hit, but that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you discuss his recollection of the events of the\r\nassassination day with Governor Connally on any other occasion?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Oh, yes; sporadically, during his convalescence.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else did he say to you at any other time?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. He was just simply asking questions about things that\r\nhappened to him in the Emergency Room, in the Operating Room, and he\r\nwas a little surprised that he didn't recall them better, but this was\r\nafter he was wounded in here, but that was really the main thing--he\r\nwas surprised that he didn't remember some of the things--like the\r\ncutdowns for blood and that sort of thing that were done to him, and,\r\nof course, this is obviously because he was so anoxic at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he ever describe anything in more detail in his\r\nrecollection of the things on the day of the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going back to the first conversation you had with\r\nMrs. Connally on November 22d, did she say anything more to you other\r\nthan that which you have already testified about?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No--those were mainly the remarks that she made. I don't\r\nremember any others, except--well, no--most of the others were--we\r\nwere discussing the Governor's condition and outlook and chances for\r\nrecovery and that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, looking again at Diagram No. 5, what is your\r\nprofessional opinion, if you have one, as to whether Governor\r\nConnally's chest injury, wrist injury, and thigh injury were caused by\r\nthe same bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Well we all thought, me included, that this was probably\r\none missile, one bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we all thought,\" whom do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Gregory--as we were reconstructing the\r\nevents in the operating room in an attempt to plot out trajectory as\r\nbest we could, this appeared to be our opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did any of your assistants consult with you in those\r\ncalculations?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I guess nearly all of them we have listed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. McClelland, Dr. Baxter and Dr. Patman?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about Dr. Osborne and Dr. Parker?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. They were working with Dr. Gregory. If they discussed it,\r\nI'm sure they did--it was before I got there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about Dr. Boland and Dr. Duke who worked with Dr. Shaw?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Now, again, I talked to them and they were discussing it\r\nas they did the chest procedure, and again thought the same thing.\r\nEveryone was under the impression this was one missile--through and\r\nthrough the chest, through and through the arm and the thigh.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any one of the doctors on either of these three\r\nteams who had a different point of view?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think it is possible that Governor Connally could\r\nhave been struck by two bullets, one entering his back and emerging\r\nfrom his chest and the second going into his wrist?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I'm sure it is possible, because missile sites are so\r\nvariable, depending upon the size of the bullet, the speed at which\r\nit travels, whether it was tumbling or not. We have seen all kinds of\r\ncombinations of entrance and exit wounds and it's just impossible to\r\nstate with any certainty, looking at a given wound, what the nature of\r\nthe missile was, so I am sure it is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think it is possible that, assuming a missile being\r\na bullet 6.5 mm. with a velocity of over 2,000 feet per second, and\r\nthe distance between the weapon and the victim being approximately 160\r\nto 250 feet, that the same bullet might have passed through President\r\nKennedy, entering his back near the midline and emerging from his neck,\r\nand then entering Governor Connally in the back and emerging from his\r\nchest, into his wrist, through his wrist and into the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I assume that it would be possible. The main thing that\r\nwould make me think that this was not the case in that he remembers so\r\ndistinctly hearing a shot and having turned prior to the time he was\r\nhit, and in the position he must have been, particularly here in Figure\r\n5, I think it's obvious that he did turn rather sharply to the right\r\nand this would make me think that it was a second shot, but this is\r\npurely conjecture, of course.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is there anything, aside from what he told you, that\r\nis, anything in the characteristics of the wounds on President Kennedy\r\nand the wounds on Governor Connally which would lead you to conclude\r\nthat it was not the same bullet?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No--there is nothing. It could have been--purely from the\r\nstandpoint of the wounds, it is possible.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You referred just a minute ago to his turning position?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is the postulation of a turning by Governor Connally\r\nnecessary to explain the point of entry in the back, exit in the chest,\r\nentry in the wrist, and exit in the wrist, and entry into the thigh, in\r\norder to have that line--to state it differently, is it necessary to\r\npostulate turning by the Governor?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Depending upon the angle of the trajectory--I suppose not.\r\nI don't know what the angle of the trajectory was from where the bullet\r\nwas fired.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assuming an angle of declination of approximately 45\r\ndegrees?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. This, I don't know without drawing it out, but as long as\r\nhis right arm is drawn in front of him next to the exit wound on the\r\nchest, he is in a sitting position, if the angle of declination was\r\nright, then I think he could have received this facing straight forward.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, on the wrist, would that be palm of the wrist, back\r\nof the wrist, or how?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I don't understand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what position would the wrist have had to be in, in\r\norder to have the same bullet make all three wounds?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. The main point was that his arm be up here. In other words,\r\nin some fashion, however his hand happened to be turned, but he had to\r\nhave his right arm raised up, next to his chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. His wrist would have to be up with the palm down, would it\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. As depicted here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In order for the point of entry to be on the dorsal side?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. That's right, again, which makes it a little more likely\r\nhe was turning, since ordinarily you pronate your wrist as you turn,\r\nwhereas, this would have been a little strange for him to have been\r\nsitting like this, but again, depending on what he had in his hand.\r\nIt's just a question of which side is up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But it would be more natural, you say, for the palm to be\r\ndown in the turning, which was as contrasted with a relaxed sitting\r\nposition where it would be more likely his palm would be facing in\r\ntowards his chest area?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any knowledge as to the damage which was done\r\nto the rib?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Only from hearsay from Dr. Shaw, that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have any knowledge as to what fragments there were\r\nin the chest, bullet fragments, if any?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No, again except from postoperative X-rays, there is a\r\nsmall fragment remaining, but the initial fragments I think Dr. Shaw\r\nsaw before I arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about the fragments in the wrist, do you have any\r\nknowledge of that?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Again, there were small fragments which I saw during\r\nthe procedure on the wrist, but I was not directly involved in that\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What opinion do you have, if any, Dr. Shires, as to\r\nwhether the wound in the thigh might have been inflicted from a missile\r\nthat did not pass through any other part of the Governor's body,\r\nassuming that it was a 6.5-mm. bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2,000\r\nfeet per second, traveling approximately 160 to 250 feet between the\r\nend of the weapon and the point of impact on the thigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Well, again, in that wound--it was strange in that the hole\r\nin the skin was too large for the amount of damage inflicted on the\r\nunderlying tissues, so that had this been the case, this would have had\r\nto have been a tangential wound. Had it been a tangential wound, then\r\nit's possible that small fragments could have gone into bone as it did\r\nand that the damage to the soft tissues was done only by that small\r\nfragment, so that the major portion of the bullet simply hit the skin\r\nin a tangent and went on in its course elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is it possible that the bullet could have hit\r\nGovernor Connally with the thigh being the initial point of impact and\r\ndo the damage which was done there with the high velocity missile that\r\nI have just described for you?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Is it possible to get a wound like that?\r\n\r\nDr. SPECTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; as long as it's on a tangent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it likely to receive a wound like that from a high\r\nvelocity weapon of 2,000 feet per second and at about 160 to 250 feet?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. If it's a tangential wound, tangential wounds can be very\r\nstrange. A large bullet can cause a small hole if its on a tangent or\r\na small bullet can rip out a fairly large hole on a tangent. It just\r\ndepends on the time of contact and the angle of contact with the skin.\r\nThat's why it's awfully hard to predict.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that wound could have either been the first striking\r\nof the Governor from the bullet, or it could have been from a missile\r\nwhose velocity was spent after going through President Kennedy and\r\nthrough the Governor's body and wrist and then caused that wound in the\r\nthigh?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. That's right, if it was a tangential bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dr. Shires, have you ever been contacted by any\r\nrepresentative of the Federal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was it who contacted you?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. I don't recall the name--it was two individuals from the\r\nSecret Service. They presented their credentials at the time to the\r\nadministration and then subsequently to me and they were given copies\r\nof our operative reports, statements made by people concerned with the\r\nPresident and Governor at the time, and then subsequently one of those\r\nsame two men from Secret Service returned and charted the entrance and\r\nexit wounds which you have described previously, or we have looked at\r\npreviously in these five diagrams.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever been interviewed by any other representative\r\nof the Federal Government before today?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; not in person. I discussed over the phone with the\r\nFBI--well, that was with regard to Oswald. I discussed over the phone\r\nwhat happened to the bullet that was taken from Oswald, but not with\r\nregard to the President or the Governor--no.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On your prior interviews by the Secret Service, sir, did\r\nthey cover the same subjects which you and I have gone over today, or\r\nwere other subjects covered?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; essentially the same subjects.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was any different information given to you by the\r\nSecret Service at that time of either of those two occasions?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No; the same as we have discussed here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, prior to the time when you were sworn in and the\r\ncourt reporter started to take the deposition in shorthand form, did\r\nyou and I have a brief discussion about the purpose of the deposition\r\nand the subject matters of interest to the Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the same information given by you to me during\r\nthe course of that informal discussion as you have testified to on the\r\nrecord here this afternoon?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes; in less detail.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have anything which you would care to add which\r\nyou think might be helpful to the Commission in its work?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, fine, that concludes the deposition, thank you very\r\nmuch, Dr. Shires.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Are you interested in Oswald--that's my only other question?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, let's talk about it a little off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between Counsel Specter and witness Dr. Shires off the\r\nrecord at this point.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let's go back on the record. Dr. Shires, before concluding\r\nthe deposition, permit me to ask you just a few additional questions\r\nabout care for Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I again show you Commission exhibit No. 392, the last\r\ntwo pages which purport to be an operative record of Parkland Memorial\r\nHospital on November 24, 1963, concerning treatment of Mr. Oswald, with\r\nyou listed as the surgeon, and I'll ask you to take a look at these two\r\nsheets and tell us whether or not that is a report which you prepared\r\non treatment of Mr. Oswald?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes, it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline in a very general way what his condition\r\nwas when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. When he was first seen in the emergency room, he was\r\nunconscious, without blood pressure or pulse, but with an audible heart\r\nbeat, and attempts, feeble though they were, attempts in respiration.\r\nThere was an entrance wound over the left lower chest and the bullet\r\ncould be felt subcutaneously over the lower chest lateral projecting\r\nthis trajectory through the body and looking at his general condition,\r\nit was fairly obvious that the bullet had transgressed virtually every\r\nmajor organ and vessel in the abdominal cavity, which later proved to\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do for him?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. He was given resuscitation, including an endotracheal tube,\r\nintravenous fluids, blood, moved to the operating room, prepared,\r\ndraped, an abdominal incision, laparotomy made, just as is described in\r\nthe record. The injuries were in fact mortal and involved both major\r\nvessels in the abdomen, the aorta, the inferior vena cava, and there\r\nhad been massive exanguinating hemorrhage into the abdomen--in and\r\naround the abdomen.\r\n\r\nAfter securing control of all the many, many bleeding points and the\r\nbleeding organs, he never had regained consciousness. Approximately 15,\r\n16--whatever it is, approximately, pints of blood had been given, and\r\nhe had suffered irreparable anoxia from the initial massive blood loss\r\nincident to the gunshot wound. When his heart did stop, even though\r\nwe felt this was a terminal cessation of heartbeat, efforts were made\r\nat resuscitation by open heart massage and all that went with it, but\r\nnever once was an effective heartbeat obtained, so that our initial\r\nimpression was that it was correct in that this was simply cardiac\r\ndeath and not cardiac arrest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you come close to saving him, in the vernacular--in\r\nlay terms?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. There has never been recorded in medical literature\r\nrecovery from a wound like this. There was too much blood lost too\r\nfast. Had the injury occurred right outside the operating room, it\r\nmight have been possible to reduce the period of anoxia that comes\r\nfrom overwhelming blood loss like this, sufficiently to have corrected\r\nit. We did control all the bleeding points with a lot of difficulty,\r\nfinally all bleeding points were controlled and this was a mortal\r\nwound--there was no question about that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are the details of your observations, examination, and\r\ntreatment of Mr. Oswald set forth in the two pages of this report which\r\nI have just shown you in Commission No. 392?\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Yes, the operative reports that are contained there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Shires.\r\n\r\nDr. SHIRES. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DR. RICHARD BROOKS DULANY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Dr. Richard Brooks Dulany was taken at 6:20 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Dr. Richard Dulany is present in\r\nresponse to the request that he appear to have his deposition taken and\r\nhe has been requested to appear here because he has been identified\r\nin prior depositions as perhaps being one of the first doctors to see\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nDr. Dulany, have you had an opportunity to examine the Executive Order\r\ncreating the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the rules and regulations relating to the taking of\r\ntestimony?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you willing to have your deposition taken here today,\r\neven though you haven't had the 3 days' notice which you have a right\r\nto, if you want it?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are willing to waive that requirement?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you stand up now and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Richard Brooks Dulany.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your profession?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. M.D.--Medical Doctor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you licensed to practice medicine in the State of\r\nTexas?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you outline your educational background, please,\r\nstarting with college--graduation from college?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. From college I went to the University Medical School of\r\nOklahoma and then took my internship here at Parkland Hospital and was\r\nin the service for 2 years in the Navy, and I just got back from the\r\nservice in November, and started a residency here in surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to participate in the care of\r\nPresident Kennedy on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Is this all recorded now?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Well, as I stated, I principally cared for the Governor and\r\nthen after his emergency treatment had been cared for, I went into the\r\nroom where President Kennedy was being cared for.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present from the start of the Governor's\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about what time did you go into the room where the\r\nPresident was being treated?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Well, I believe the Governor was supposed to have been in\r\nthe surgery suite upstairs within 12 minutes after he came in, and so\r\nI'm sure I must have been in the room where the President was, about 7\r\nminutes or so afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time was that, about, as best you can place it?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I don't really recollect the specific times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe as to the condition of the President\r\nwhen you entered?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Well, at this time his pupils were fixed and dilated and he\r\nhad a large head wound--that was the first thing I noticed.\r\n\r\nThere was already a tracheotomy tube in the neck wound or what was\r\nlater described as a wound, and had a cutdown running and several other\r\ndoctors were putting chest tubes in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors were present at that time?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I really can't be accurate on that. I remember Dr. Clark\r\nand Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke, Dr. Carrico, Dr. Martin White, and of\r\ncourse, the doctor that was probably down first of the staff members,\r\nDr. Malcolm Perry, and I remember Dr. McClelland, and Dr. Peters were\r\nin there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are those all the doctors you remember as being down there?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I believe those are all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you identify any of the nurses who were there?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. No, I don't believe so. I can't remember them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there anything that you think that you know would be\r\nhelpful to the President's Commission in its inquiry into this matter?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I don't believe I could add anything any more than you\r\nprobably already know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe any neck wound on the President?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The tracheotomy had already been performed?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. It had been placed in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had the incision already been made when you first saw the\r\nPresident's neck?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. I really didn't examine it close enough to make any\r\nstatement along that line.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then, did you observe any wound in the President's neck at\r\nall?\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. No, I just know that the tracheotomy was in and later I was\r\ntold that this was a wound when it was first seen--you know, that's the\r\nbest I can tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's fine, Dr. Dulany, thank you very much for appearing\r\nhere today.\r\n\r\nDr. DULANY. Yes; thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RUTH JEANETTE STANDRIDGE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Ruth Jeanette Standridge was taken at 1:35 p.m., on\r\nMarch 21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Miss Standridge, would you stand up and raise your right\r\nhand, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy in these\r\ndeposition proceedings will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, you may be seated.\r\n\r\nMiss Standridge, the President's Commission is investigating the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and all the facts relating thereto,\r\nand we have asked you to appear to have your deposition taken in\r\nconnection with the treatment which was given to Governor Connally\r\nin Parkland Memorial Hospital and to President Kennedy in Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital, and all facts relating to that.\r\n\r\nHave you received a letter from the President's Commission requesting\r\nthat you appear?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, there was a letter came and I was out of town\r\nand they opened it, the supervisor opened it and she had the letter,\r\nbut I haven't seen it yet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You haven't seen it yet?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, let me show you the enclosures which were in the\r\nletter so that you may be familiar with them. Here is a copy of the\r\nWhite House Executive order establishing the Commission, and here is\r\na resolution establishing the rules for taking testimony. Permit me\r\nto explain to you that the rules require that we give you 3 days'\r\nnotice, so that if you would request it now, we could delay taking your\r\ndeposition until sometime next week, if you would prefer, or if you are\r\nagreeable to have us take your deposition, we can go right ahead and\r\ntake it now.\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE (reading instruments referred to). Thank you, you can\r\njust go ahead if you want to--it's all right with me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It doesn't make any difference to you whether it is today\r\nor next week?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No; it does not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name, please?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Ruth Jeanette Standridge.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation or profession?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Head nurse of the emergency rooms.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At what hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your duties on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I was working as charge nurse in the major surgery\r\narea in Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you receive notification that the President of the\r\nUnited States was en route to Parkland Hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes; by my supervisor, Doris Nelson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at about what time did you receive that notification?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. About 12:30, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action, if any, did you take as a result of\r\ngetting that notice?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Immediately went to trauma room 2 and I was in trauma\r\nroom 2 and began to set up Renger liquid and check the suction machine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was trauma room 1 set up?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Mrs. Nelson was setting trauma room 1 up at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when one or more of the victims arrived?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was it arrived?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Governor Connally was brought into trauma room 2 first.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe President Kennedy arrive?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No; I was busy with the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you do when the Governor arrived?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, we began to take his clothing off and the\r\norderlies continued that and the doctors and I started handing the\r\nsyringe and medicine and things necessary to start the IV.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, what do you mean by \"IV\"?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Intravenous fluids.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you assist in the taking off of Governor\r\nConnally's clothes?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you notice with respect to the\r\nGovernor's shirt?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. There was blood on the front of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any bullet hole on the front of the shirt?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Not that I can say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. There could have been or could not have been, but you just\r\ndon't know?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. There could have been, but mostly it was just blood\r\nthat we noticed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice anything on the coat?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. There was blood on the coat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he wearing his suit coat?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice whether or not there was any bullet hole in\r\nthe coat?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I didn't see one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was Governor Connally's position when you first saw\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. He was laying on his back on the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what kind of cart was he lying on?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. The emergency cart on rollers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is that emergency cart constructed of?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, it's just a thin fixture with rubber padding on\r\nthe top, and it is used to transfer the patients to the wards, and to\r\nX-ray and to surgery.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it made of metal?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Of metal with four big tires on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With four roller tires on it?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was on the cart underneath the Governor?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, there was just a sheet was all we had on there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there anything on top of the Governor?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, we put a sheet, when we unclothed him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he completely undressed?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was he lying on top of that cart while he was being\r\nundressed?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who assisted you in the process of undressing him?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, David Sanders was helping, he was my orderly\r\nthat was in the room, and also an aid, Rosa Majors, and she took the\r\nmoney out of his pants, and Dr. Fueishier.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How do you spell that?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. F-u-e-i-s-h-i-e-r (spelling), and Dr. Duke, and there\r\nwas a couple of other doctors--I don't remember who they were, but they\r\nwere up at the head, Dr. Fueishier and Dr. Duke, and Dr. Shaw came in\r\nbefore they got the Governor's clothes off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any object in Governor Connally's clothing?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Not unusual.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice a bullet, specifically?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you hear the sound of anything fall?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there other noises going on in the room at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes, there were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Governor Connally completely undressed in the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I believe so, to the best of my knowledge he was, I\r\nthink everything was taken off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was done with Governor Connally following the\r\ncompletion of his being undressed?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. He was immediately carried to the elevator--emergency\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in what way was he carried to the emergency elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. On the emergency cart that he came into emergency room\r\non.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that also describable as a stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say \"Yes\"?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you assist in pushing him into the elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I started and then there was enough doctors pushing\r\nhim and I went back to get his clothing and by the time I came back up\r\nagain--I went just as quickly as I could walk back to trauma room 2\r\nand got the clothing, I ran back up to catch him, and the elevator was\r\nclosing with him on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you actually see Governor Connally being wheeled into\r\nthe elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No, the door was closing as I got back around. I\r\nstarted with him down the hall and then before I got back, they had put\r\nhim into the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who assisted in pushing him out of the emergency room and\r\ndown the hall--is it a little ways?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, it's through the OB and GYN section.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that \"Obstetrics and Gynecology\" section?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes; you go through that section to get to this\r\nelevator from the major surgery section.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far did you help push him from the major surgery\r\nsection?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. About from the door that went into OBGN.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how far is that?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Oh, about 20 feet, I guess, and they had about another\r\n20 feet to go before they turned to the left to get to the elevator,\r\nwhich is about 6 or 8 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, you left him and went back to the emergency room to\r\nget his clothes, and when you came back, did you see any part of the\r\nstretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, I could just see--I could see the\r\nstretcher--yes; and the doors and everybody in the elevator and the\r\ndoor was closed in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see Governor Connally on the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No, not--I think his feet were at the end--I could\r\njust see feet--I believe the feet were there at that door, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, you saw the same doctors around the stretcher who\r\nwere pushing him when you last saw him?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure that was Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No, that's what I said--I just saw his feet, which I\r\nassumed it was--it was the same doctors.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how long elapsed from the time you stopped pushing\r\nthe stretcher until the time you got there to look and see just his\r\nfeet?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Just a second, I mean, just a few seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You went back and got his clothes?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do with those clothes?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I asked the administrator who should I give them to,\r\nand they told me to give them to Governor Connally's party and they\r\nwere in the minor medicine section and I went out there and there were\r\ntwo gentlemen out there and I asked them who I wanted to see--I wanted\r\nto see somebody in Governor Connally's party, and they opened the door\r\nand they asked for somebody, and he said he was--he identified himself\r\nas Cliff Carter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you give him the clothing?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what he did with it?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you heard what he did with it?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I've heard that it got lost and they found it in\r\nRepresentative Gonzales' office in a closet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is he a Texas Representative?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In his office closet where?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. In Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you limited in anyway from entering into the operating\r\nroom area?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. We are limited, but there is a place where the spots\r\nare painted on the floor that is is legal for us to go through into the\r\nhallway into the nurses' station.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You can go around in part of the operating room area?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Isn't into the premises--it's just in the hallway into\r\nthe nurses' station.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the reason for limiting you from going beyond\r\nthat into the operating room area?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, we are not considered--we would be contaminating.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, is there some problem about flammable gases up there?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Anesthesia equipment, that's right, and these spots\r\nare painted there, and if you don't have the proper shoes on, they will\r\nbe a conductor, you know, and these spots are there for that area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Governor Connally removed from the stretcher at\r\nanytime while he was in the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No; he wasn't. He never went to X-ray or he wasn't\r\ntaken off at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does the elevator that the stretcher was pushed into go\r\nonly to the operating room?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No; it stops on first floor and also goes up to\r\ndelivery--up to the delivery room on third floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is on first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No patients--only classrooms and administrative\r\noffices--business offices.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is on third floor?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. The delivery room--it opens up into the delivery room\r\nand then the post mortem wards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything you would like to add which you think\r\nmight be helpful to us in any way?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, not that I can think of other than that I have\r\nalready stated.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see President Kennedy's stretcher at any time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes; I was in the room--I took the mop in. The\r\norderlies mopped the floor and we cleaned the wall, the blood off of\r\nthe walls and so forth, to get it presentable before Mrs. Kennedy came\r\nback in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was President Kennedy in the room at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him there?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you identified him from what you knew he looked like?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how was he clothed at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, as far as from his waist up--was all that was\r\nuncovered and they were trying to protect his head with a sheet--it was\r\nwrapped around his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What clothing did he have on from the waist down?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. It was just a sheet cover--I don't know of anything\r\nunder the cover, whether there was or not. I assumed he was all\r\nunclothed, which we do routinely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He was all unclothed?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I said I assumed he was--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did he have from the waist up?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was he on at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. A stretcher cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see what happened to that stretcher afterward?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I didn't notice. They moved it from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what happened to the sheets that were on the\r\nPresident's stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you and I meet previously before I started to take\r\nthe deposition here today and talk about the procedures for the\r\ninvestigation by the Warren Commission?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you and I been discussing here, with me asking\r\nquestions and you making answers all the things which we talked about\r\nbefore the court reporter came in?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever talked to any other representative of the\r\nFederal Government?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. The Secret Service--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you talk with them once or more than once?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, I talked with them one time in Mr. Wright's\r\noffice and another time just briefly--he came to see the layout of the\r\nemergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whose office--Mr. Wright?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Personnel manager here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the Secret Service men ask you about on those\r\noccasions?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, just the same thing we have gone over today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you talked with the Secret Service man in another part\r\nof the hospital on another day, you say?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. I think he came back up into the emergency room at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you talk about in the emergency room at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Well, Mrs. Nelson, she showed him the different areas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you identified some of the things?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever talked with any other representative of the\r\nFederal Government?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any representative of the State government?\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much. Those are all--those are the only\r\nquestions I have.\r\n\r\nMiss STANDRIDGE. Thank you for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JANE CAROLYN WESTER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Jane Carolyn Wester was taken on March 20, 1964,\r\nat Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas. Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Miss Wester, this is Miss Oliver the court reporter and\r\nshe will take down your testimony here and will you raise your right\r\nhand and take the oath?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this\r\nproceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record preliminarily show that the purpose of this\r\nproceeding is in connection with the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy to ascertain facts relating to the\r\nassassination and all medical treatment obtained by President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally following their being shot.\r\n\r\nThe witness at the moment is Miss Jane Wester who has been asked to\r\ntestify concerning any facts of which she has knowledge concerning\r\ntreatment of President Kennedy or Governor Connally and the disposition\r\nof Governor Connally's clothing and sheet in which he was wrapped at\r\nthe time the Governor was brought into the operating room at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name, for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Jane Carolyn Wester.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your residence address, Miss Wester?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. 1107 Brockbank, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you received a letter of notification from the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy\r\nadvising you that I would contact you for the purpose of taking\r\ntestimony from you in connection with this proceeding, Miss Wester?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at that time did you receive the copies of the\r\nExecutive order creating the Commission and the rules and regulations\r\nrelating to the taking of testimony?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you satisfied to appear here today and answer some\r\nquestions relating to your participation in the treatment of Governor\r\nConnally?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes, sir; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation or profession, please?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I am a registered nurse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what institution are you employed?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been so employed at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Nine years--or 9 1/2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you outline your duties in a general way as they were\r\nback on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I am assistant supervisor in the operating room, and I\r\nassign personnel duties, direct them in their activities.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you receive notice on that date that President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally were en route to Parkland Memorial Hospital to\r\nreceive treatment?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I was not aware that they were in the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When was it first brought to your attention, if at all?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. At noon, around noon--noontime--I'm not sure as to the\r\nexact time it was. I was relieving the secretary for lunch and the\r\nphone rang. Someone in the pathology department asked if the President\r\nwere in the operating room and I answered them, \"No,\" and they said\r\nthat a Secret Service agent was down there and as soon as the\r\nPresident did arrive in the operating room, would I please call them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your next connection, if any, with respect to the\r\ntreatment of either President Kennedy or Governor Connally at Parkland?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I received a phone call from the emergency room asking us\r\nto set up for a craniotomy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is a craniotomy in lay language?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. That's an exploration of the head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other request made at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes--well--immediately following, following that I\r\nreceived a call to set up for a thoracotomy, which is an exploration of\r\nthe chest.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were those two set ups made in accordance with the\r\nrequests you received?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes; I immediately assigned personnel to set up these two\r\nrooms for these two cases.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what room was used for the craniotomy?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The craniotomy was set up in room 7.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what room was used for the thoracotomy?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The thoracotomy was set up in room 5.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And on what floor were the two rooms?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Well, on the south wing of the second floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What happened next in connection with this matter?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I assigned personnel to take care of the doorways to keep\r\ntraffic out of the operating room and keep people back--keep the halls\r\nclear. Shortly thereafter, Governor Connally arrived in the operating\r\nroom with several doctors--arrived by stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, in what way did a stretcher arrive from the first\r\nfloor, or by what means of locomotion?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The stretcher arrived by an elevator which is in the\r\noperating room--it comes directly from emergency room and which--there\r\nwere several doctors with him that brought the stretchers up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what happened to the stretcher after it left the\r\nelevator on the second floor of the operating room area?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The doctors brought this and were proceeding down the\r\nhall, and I met them in the center of the operating room suite itself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how far is that from the elevator door?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Approximately 50 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done then with Governor Connally on the\r\nstretcher, following the point where you met them?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. We proceeded to room 5 and outside of room 5 we\r\ntransferred Governor Connally from the stretcher onto an operating\r\ntable and removed his clothes from the bottom of the stretcher and\r\nplaced them in the hallway by the operating table.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what way was Governor Connally dressed or robed when\r\nyou first saw him on the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. As far as I know, the only thing he had was a sheet on\r\nhim. He had no hospital gown or anything else that I know of on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had his clothes then been removed by that time?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes; he arrived without his clothes. They were on the\r\nbottom of the cart in a paper sack.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you said he was transferred from the stretcher onto an\r\noperating table?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was that inside the operating room? Or outside the\r\noperating room?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No; it's in the hallway right outside room 5--we\r\ntransferred him onto the operating table, and then moved the table into\r\nthe operating room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did he have any clothing on at the time you\r\ntransferred him from the stretcher onto the operating table?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I don't recall any clothes that he had on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was then done with Governor Connally on the operating\r\ntable?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The operating table was moved into the operating room and\r\nat that time they proceeded to start anesthetics on him and put him to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors were in attendance of Governor Connally at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Dr.--there were many--Dr. Giesecke, G-i-e-s-e-c-k-e\r\n(spelling)--there were so many. Dr. Ray, I believe, was there, and\r\nthere were many others--right offhand, I can't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you go into the operating room at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I went as far as the doorway with him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what was done with the stretcher on which he came to\r\nthat point?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I took the stretcher and rolled it to the center area of\r\nthe operating room suite--rolled the sheets up on the stretcher into a\r\nsmall bundle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there one sheet or more than one sheet?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I believe there were two sheets and I rolled one inside\r\nthe other up into a small bundle.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is the next normal procedure with respect to the\r\nnumber of sheets on such a stretcher in like circumstances?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. The cart--the mattress on the cart is covered with one\r\nsheet, the patient is usually covered with another. When they arrive in\r\nthe operating room the sheet covering the patient is removed and a grey\r\ncotton blanket is placed over the patient and the sheets are rolled up\r\nand usually returned to the emergency room with the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else, if anything, was on that stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. There were several glassine packets, small packets of\r\nhypodermic needles--well, packed in and sterilized in. There were\r\nseveral others-some alcohol sponges and a roll of 1-inch tape. Those\r\nthings, I definitely know, were on the cart, and the sheets, of course.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any other objects on the cart, on the stretcher\r\ncart?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Right off, I can't remember----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recollect whether there were any gloves on the cart?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. There could have been--I don't recall right off--I can't\r\nremember that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall whether there were any tools on one end of\r\nthe stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I know I set something down on the cart, I think it was a\r\ncurved hemostat--I couldn't say for sure--I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you have testified that you met Governor Connally\r\non the stretcher when he was 50 feet from the elevator door. Is there\r\nany object at about that spot that is a landmark, so to speak, of that\r\nparticular spot?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Where I met Governor Connally in the operating room?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. There is a clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how far from the clock is the door to the operating\r\nroom, room 5, where Governor Connally was taken?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I would say approximately 75 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what did you do with the stretcher after Governor\r\nConnally was taken off of it?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. I moved the stretcher back to the center area, fairly\r\nclose to the clock, it wasn't right under it, but fairly close, and an\r\norderly, R. J. Jimison, walked up----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. His initials are R. J.?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. And he stood at the cart while I rolled the sheets up and\r\nremoved the items from the cart, and from there he took the cart and\r\nproceeded to the elevator with it and the last time I saw him he was\r\nstanding at the elevator with the cart waiting for him to be picked up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see that stretcher any more that day?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe in a general way what that stretcher\r\nlooked like?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Well, it has four wheels and a lower shelf, a thin\r\nmattress on it, and side rails on it, on each side of the cart. It\r\nhas a rubber rim at the edge of it, sort of a bumper type to the upper\r\nshelf of the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is it constructed of?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Well, it's a metal--steel.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with the mattress?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. It remained on the cart. It was not moved then, only the\r\nsheets were left and rolled into a bundle. And, when the sheets were\r\nrolled into a bundle, I didn't actually lift them up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see Miss Jeanette Standridge at any time in\r\nconnection with this particular movement of the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see Mrs. Henrietta Ross at any time in connection\r\nwith this particular movement of the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No; I believe she walked up on my right as I was rolling\r\nthe sheets up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see Darrell C. Tomlinson at any time in connection\r\nwith this particular movement of the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you interviewed by the Secret Service about these\r\nevents at some time in the past?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you interviewed by anyone else?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did the Secret Service interview on one occasion or\r\nmore than one occasion?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Only one occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And immediately prior to your being sworn in and starting\r\nto take this deposition, did I have a very brief conversation with you\r\nabout the purpose of this proceeding?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes; you did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about the facts to which you have testified since this\r\nformal deposition started?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at that did you tell me all the facts previously\r\ntestified to here to this effect?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the sheet on which the Governor was lying have\r\nanything on it?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. It had some blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you made any notes or any written record of that sort\r\nconcerning the matters about which you have testified here today?\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. No; I haven't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That concludes the deposition, and I thank you very much\r\nfor appearing here.\r\n\r\nMiss WESTER. Fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. HENRIETTA M. ROSS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mrs. Henrietta M. Ross was taken at 6:50 p.m., on\r\nMarch 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr.\r\nArlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that the oath has been administered\r\nto Mrs. Henrietta Ross who is appearing here in response to a letter\r\nrequest to testify as part of the inquiry of the President's Commission\r\non the Assassination of President Kennedy, which involves the treatment\r\nof President Kennedy and Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ross has been asked to appear and testify concerning her knowledge\r\nabout the stretcher cart on which Governor Connally was transported\r\nwhile in the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With that preliminary statement, I'll ask you, Mrs. Ross,\r\nto state your full name?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Mrs. Henrietta Magnolia Ross.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where are you employed?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what capacity?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Operating room technician.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what were your duties on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Stand in the hall and guard the hall and not let anyone pass\r\nby I did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to see Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes; as he came down the hall on the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him as he left the elevator?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. About--it should have been after 1 o'clock because I was\r\nsupposed to go to a class that day and I couldn't go.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was with him at the time, if anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. There were doctors all around in the corridor and I\r\ndon't know exactly who--I only remember one person and that was Dr.\r\nGustafason, because he gave me his coat to hang up as he was passing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Miss Jane Wester there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. She was up there; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you see them do with the Governor, if\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. They pushed him down in front of room 5 and onto the\r\noperating table and put him on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were they pushing him on?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. On a stretcher from the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe the stretcher for me, please, starting\r\nwith what was it made of?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. It has four legs, four wheels and has a little rubber sheet\r\non it. I mean, a rubber mattress, and the length of the normal body is\r\nthe length of the cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it made of metal?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was done with the stretcher cart after they\r\nrolled Governor Connally off of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. It was pushed back up toward room 3.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that toward the elevator?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And by whom was it pushed?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Jimison.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. R. J. Jimison?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. I don't know Jimison's initials, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He's one of the orderlies there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you last see the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. In front of room 3.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did Jimison have it in his control at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. The last time I looked he was pushing it; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to the Secret Service about this?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. One time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you talk to anyone else from the Federal Government\r\nabout this matter?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add which you think might be\r\nhelpful to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for appearing.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROSS. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF R. J. JIMISON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of R. J. Jimison was taken at 2:35 p.m., on March 21,\r\n1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas. Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you stand up, please, Mr. Jimison, and raise your\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you shall give before this\r\nCommission in the deposition proceedings will be the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Jimison, have you received a letter of notification\r\nfrom the President's Commission advising you that you would be\r\ncontacted to have your deposition taken?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did that letter contain in it a copy of the Executive\r\norder creating the Commission, a copy of the joint congressional\r\nresolution about the Commission, and the procedures for taking\r\ndepositions by the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I believe it did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you willing to have your deposition taken today, sir;\r\ndo you have any objection to my asking you some questions and having\r\nthem reported by the court reporter here?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. No; I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By whom are you employed, Mr. Jimison?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I would just say the hospital--County Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Parkland Memorial Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes; Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What kind of work do you do here?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Orderly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let the record show that you have a badge on which says,\r\n\"R. J. Jimison\".\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. \"Orderly.\" And is that your full name?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what does the \"R\" stand for?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. That's just an initial name.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about the \"J\"?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Same.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, people call you \"R. J.\"?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your duties back on November 22, 1963, Mr.\r\nJimison?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. My duties was the same as usual; that is, to transport\r\npatients to and fro, reclean rooms, betwixt each case.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to see President Kennedy on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to see Governor Connally on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the circumstances under which you saw Governor\r\nConnally?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, I would say it wasn't such a pleasant circumstance,\r\nbut he was lying on a carriage, a hospital carriage, and I was--I\r\nassisted in helping move him from the carriage to the operating table.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was he when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. He was on the second floor in the operating room suite,\r\nnear room 4, where his operation was performed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he taken to room 4 or room 5?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. He was taken in room--I thought it was room 4, but maybe\r\nit could have been room 5, but I taken it to be room 4, because like I\r\ntold you, I helped lift him off of the table, but usually we help put\r\nthem in the room--at that time there was so many doctors that I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see Governor Connally from the time he came off of\r\nthe elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What floor were you on when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I was on two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far was he from the elevator when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I guess he must have been about 20 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how far was it from the elevator to the place where\r\nyou were?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. About how many feet? About 20 or 30 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he near the big clock when you first saw him, the\r\nclock that is overhead in the center there?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were there doctors around him at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you help push the stretcher from that point to----\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. (interrupting) No; I followed behind him to room 4 and I\r\nhelped them take him off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You helped them take Governor Connally and put him on the\r\noperating table?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what then was done with the stretcher that he was on?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, the stretcher at that time was moved back from the\r\ntable, of course, because they had to make room for the doctors to\r\nget up close to the table, which was back just a'ways and when I got\r\nfree--whether it was Miss Wester or Mrs. Ross there--they pushed it\r\nback a little further, but they didn't get quite to the elevator with\r\nit; I came along and pushed it onto the elevator myself and loaded it\r\non and pushed the door closed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was on the stretcher at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I noticed nothing more than a little flat mattress and two\r\nsheets as usual.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was the position of the sheets?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Of course, them sheets was, of course, as usual, flat out\r\non the bed.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had they been rolled up?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. More or less, not rolled, which, yes, usually they is, the\r\nmattress and sheets are all just throwed, one of them about halfway, it\r\nwould be just throwed about halfway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the sheets flat or just turned over?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, just turned over.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were they crumpled up in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, there was a possibility it was strictly--a tragic\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It was what?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. It was a tragic day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Right, and everybody was a little shook up on account of\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. We didn't look too close.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there anything else on the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I never noticed anything else at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could there have been some empty packets of hypodermic\r\nneedles or an alcohol sponge?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. There could have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Or a 1-inch roll of tape?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. There could have been something--small stuff, but nothing\r\nlarge like bundles or anything like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you do with the stretcher then, you said?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Pushed it on the rear elevator, which goes downstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other elevator which goes downstairs to the\r\nemergency area?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Not close in the emergency area--that's the only one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the purpose for your putting it on that elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. It goes back to emergency because it can be cleaned up\r\nthere and remade and put in use again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it customarily your job to put it back on the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever take it down and put it in order yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. No, sir; we never carry it down ourselves. The fact\r\nis--the purpose is--we have enough to do up there, and we have men up\r\nthere to take care of that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Somebody else is supposed to take the elevator up there?\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. One of them--we put it on the elevator, then it becomes\r\nthe responsibility of the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other stretcher placed on that elevator\r\nlater that day?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Not during my shift.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you the only man who would put the stretcher on the\r\nelevator if there were one?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. No, I is not, but might near--I could might near see of\r\nanybody--from where the elevator sits from where the halls were--I\r\ncould might near see all of the stretchers put on there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If a stretcher was put on there it would have to be in\r\nyour presence?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I would have had to be hid where I wouldn't be able to see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you put the stretcher from Governor Connally\r\non the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I'm not too sure I know of the time. I really don't know\r\nexactly the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, about how long after he was taken into the operating\r\nroom, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. It was lesser than 10 minutes before or after.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What time did you get off that day?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. 3:30.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you say there was no other stretcher placed on that\r\nelevator from the time you put Governor Connally's stretcher on until\r\nthe end of the day?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Until the end of my shift. You see, that's the\r\nemergency--from the emergency that we had from that time that he was\r\nbrought up until I was relieved from duty that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any bullets on the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I never noticed any at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did I sit down and talk with you for a few minutes before\r\nthe court reporter came in to take this all down here today?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have I asked you questions and have you given me\r\nanswers just like in our short discussion before this deposition\r\nstarted?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. (No response.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you and I talk about the same things we have been\r\ntalking about since the court reporter came in?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever been talked to by any other person from the\r\nFederal Government?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was that?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I don't remember his name, but shortly after that\r\nhappened--I don't know, as I say, it was the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What branch was he from?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. I thought he was from the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times did you talk to somebody from the Secret\r\nService?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, I talked to him once; he just talked to me once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what about?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. The same thing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you ever talk to anybody else about this fact?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add, that you think might be\r\nhelpful to us?\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Well, no, because the fact is--because that's pretty well\r\ncovered--just, I actually want to give facts about something I know\r\nsomething about, and during the time I know something about, and what\r\nactually happened from the time I got off--I couldn't tell you, but I\r\ndo know there wasn't no carriage from the time that carriage was picked\r\nup until I got off from duty.\r\n\r\nThis ain't actually--not in it, but due to this--this is--what I'm\r\nfixing to say is off of the book--I couldn't see after President\r\nKennedy because I didn't--I never did get up to the floor--so I didn't\r\nsee him. I am glad if was any kind of help, Mr. Specter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You have been, Mr. Jimison, and we appreciate your coming\r\nin and helping us a lot.\r\n\r\nMr. JIMISON. Same back to you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DARRELL C. TOMLINSON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Darrell C. Tomlinson was taken on March 20, 1964,\r\nat Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Tomlinson, this is Miss Oliver, and she is the court\r\nreporter. Will you stand up and hold up your right hand and take the\r\noath, please?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that in the taking of your deposition in these\r\nproceedings, you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name, for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Darrell Carlisle Tomlinson.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Tomlinson, the purpose of this deposition proceeding\r\nis to take your deposition in connection with an inquiry made by\r\nthe President's Commission in connection with the Assassination\r\nof President Kennedy to determine from you all the facts, if any,\r\nwhich you know concerning the events surrounding the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and any treatment which was given at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital to either President Kennedy or Governor Connally, or\r\nanything that happened to any physical objects connected with either\r\none of those men.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, did you receive a letter advising you that the Commission\r\nwas interested in having one of its staff lawyers take your deposition\r\nconcerning this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did that letter include in it a copy of the Executive\r\norder creating the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And a copy of the congressional resolution concerning the\r\ncreation of the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And a copy of the resolution governing questioning of\r\nwitnesses by members of the Commission's staff?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing today for me to ask you some questions\r\nabout what you observed or know about this matter?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And it is satisfactory with you to proceed today rather\r\nthan to have 3 days from the time you got the letter, which was\r\nyesterday?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It's immaterial.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. It's immaterial to you?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It's immaterial--it's at your convenience.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's fine. We appreciate that, Mr. Tomlinson.\r\n\r\nThe reason is, that you have the right to a 3-day notice, but if it\r\ndoesn't matter to you, then we would like to go ahead and take your\r\ninformation today.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We call that a waiver under the law, if it is all right\r\nwith you for us to talk with you today, then I want to go ahead and do\r\nthat; is that all right?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, where are you employed, Mr. Tomlinson?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I am classed as the senior engineer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what duties are involved in general?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I'm in charge of the powerplant here at the hospital,\r\nwhich takes care of the heating and air-conditioning services for the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe the general physical layout relating to\r\nthe emergency area and how you get from the emergency area, say, to the\r\nsecond floor emergency operating rooms of Parkland Memorial Hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. You mean just the general lay?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes, sir; please.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, we have one elevator that goes from the basement\r\nto the third floor, that's what we call the emergency elevator. It's in\r\nthe south section of the hospital and that would be your most direct\r\nroute to go from the ground floor, which emergency is on, to the\r\noperating rooms on two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you have anything to do with that elevator on\r\nNovember 22, sometime around the noon hour?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you have to do with that elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, we received a call in the engineer's office,\r\nthe chief engineer's office, and he requested someone to operate the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any problem with the elevator with respect to a\r\nmechanical difficulty of any sort?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No, sir; it was an ordinary type elevator, and if it\r\nisn't keyed off it will stop every time somebody pushes a button, and\r\nthey preferred it to go only to the second floor and to the ground\r\nfloor unless otherwise instructed by the administrator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, what were you to do with this elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Key it off the ground, between ground and second floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that you would operate it in that way?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes; make a manual operation out of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you came upon that elevator, what time was it, to the\r\nbest of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It was around 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there anything on the elevator at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. There was one stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And describe the appearance of that stretcher, if you\r\nwill, please.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I believe that stretcher had sheets on it and had a\r\nwhite covering on the pad.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you say about the covering on the pad, excuse me?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I believe it was a white sheet that was on the pad.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there anything else on that?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I don't believe there was on that one, I'm not sure, but\r\nI don't believe there was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, did you do with that stretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I took it off of the elevator and put it over against\r\nthe south wall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. The ground floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other stretcher in that area at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. There was a stretcher about 2 feet from the wall already\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n(Indicating on drawing to which the witness referred.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you have just pointed to a drawing which you have\r\nmade of this situation, have you not, while we were talking a few\r\nminutes before the court reporter started to take down your testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you mark in ink with my pen the stretcher which\r\nyou pushed off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I think that it was this one right here (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you draw the outline of it in ink and mark an \"A\"\r\nright in the center of that?\r\n\r\n(Witness complied with request of Counsel Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you mark in ink the position of the stretcher\r\nwhich was already on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. This was the ground floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me, on the ground floor? Is there a different\r\ndesignation for the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where is the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. One above the ground. We have basement, ground, first,\r\nsecond, and third on that elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What floor was Governor Connally taken to, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. He was on two, he was in the operating rooms up on two.\r\nThat's our surgical suites up there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what level is the emergency entrance of the hospital\r\non?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, it's the ground floor--it's there at the back of\r\nthe hospital, you see, it's built on the incline there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the elevator which you found in this area was on the\r\nground floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. The elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The stretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you mark with a \"B\" the stretcher which was present\r\nat the time you pushed stretcher \"A\" off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. (Witness complied with the request of Counsel Specter.)\r\nI believe that's it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what, if anything, did you later observe as to\r\nstretcher \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, sir; I don't recall how long it had been exactly,\r\nbut an intern or doctor, I didn't know which, came to use the men's\r\nroom there in the elevator lobby.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where is the men's room located on this diagram?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It would be right there (indicating) beside the \"B\"\r\nstretcher.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw in ink there the outline of that room in a\r\ngeneral way?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, I really don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And would you mark that with the letter \"C\"?\r\n\r\n(Witness complied with request of Counsel Specter.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's fine. What happened when that gentleman came to use\r\nthe men's room?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, he pushed the stretcher out from the wall to get\r\nin, and then when he came out he just walked off and didn't push the\r\nstretcher back up against the wall, so I pushed it out of the way where\r\nwe would have clear area in front of the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you push it to?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I pushed it back up against the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What, if anything, happened then?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I bumped the wall and a spent cartridge or bullet rolled\r\nout that apparently had been lodged under the edge of the mat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that was from which stretcher?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I believe that it was \"B\".\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was on \"B\", if you recall; if anything?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, at one end they had one or two sheets rolled up; I\r\ndidn't examine them. They were bloody. They were rolled up on the east\r\nend of it and there were a few surgical instruments on the opposite end\r\nand a sterile pack or so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A sterile what?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. A sterile pack.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Like gauze or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there an alcohol sponge?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. There could have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there a roll of 1-inch tape?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any empty packets from hypodermic needles?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, now, it had some paper there but I don't know what\r\nthey came from.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, Mr. Tomlinson, are you sure that it was stretcher \"A\"\r\nthat you took out of the elevator and not stretcher \"B\"?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, really, I can't be positive, just to be perfectly\r\nhonest about it, I can't be positive, because I really didn't pay that\r\nmuch attention to it. The stretcher was on the elevator and I pushed\r\nit off of there and I believe we made one or two calls up before I\r\nstraightened out the stretcher up against the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"one or two calls,\" what do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Went to pick up the technician from the second floor to\r\nbring him down to the ground floor to get blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say before you straightened the stretcher up,\r\nwhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, we just rolled them out of the way where we had\r\nsome room on the elevator--that's a small elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, when you rolled them out of the elevator, when you\r\nrolled the stretcher out of the elevator, did you place it against the\r\nwall at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were both of these stretchers constructed in the same way?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Similar--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe the appearance of the stretcher with\r\nreference to what it was made of and how many shelves it had, and that\r\nsort of thing?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, it's made of tubed steel with a flat iron frame on\r\nthe top where you lay the patient and it has one shelf down between the\r\nfour wheels.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does it have any bumpers on it?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, and it has rubber bumpers.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Does it have any rail to keep the patient on?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes; they have the rails on the side made of tubed\r\nsteel. The majority of them have those.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, just before we started this deposition, before I\r\nplaced you under oath and before the court reporter started to take\r\ndown my questions and your answers, you and I had a brief talk, did we\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And we discussed in a general way the information which\r\nyou have testified about, did we not?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at the time we started our discussion, it was your\r\nrecollection at that point that the bullet came off of stretcher A, was\r\nit not?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. B.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Pardon me, stretcher B, but it was stretcher A that you\r\ntook off of the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I believe that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But there is no question but that at the time we started\r\nour discussion a few minutes before the court reporter started to take\r\nit down, that your best recollection was that it was stretcher A which\r\ncame off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, I believe that was it--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed about this matter by any other\r\nFederal representative?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who interviewed you about it?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I don't remember the name of either one of them, but one\r\nwas the FBI man and one was the Secret Service man.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times did the FBI interview you?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times did the Secret Service interview you?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did the FBI interview you?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I believe they were the first to do it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Approximately when was that?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I think that was the latter part of November.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when did the Secret Service interview you?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Approximately a week later, the first part of December.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, do you recollect what the FBI man asked you about?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Just about where I found the bullet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he ask you about these stretchers?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, he asked me about the stretchers, yes, just about\r\nthe same thing we've gone over here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did the Secret Service man ask you about?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Approximately the same thing, only, we've gone into more\r\ndetail here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell the Secret Service man about which\r\nstretcher you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I told him that I was not sure, and I am not--I'm not\r\nsure of it, but as I said, I would be going against the oath which I\r\ntook a while ago, because I am definitely not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you remember if you told the Secret Service man which\r\nstretcher you thought you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, we talked about taking a stretcher off of the\r\nelevator, but then when it comes down on an oath, I wouldn't say for\r\nsure, I really don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you recollect whether or not you told the Secret\r\nService man which stretcher you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say you can't really take an oath today to be sure\r\nwhether it was stretcher A or stretcher B that you took off the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Well, today or any other day, I'm just not sure of it,\r\nwhether it was A or B that I took off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, has your recollection always been the same about the\r\nsituation, that is, today, and when you talked to the Secret Service\r\nman and when you talked to the FBI man?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes; I told him that I wasn't sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, what you told the Secret Service man was just about\r\nthe same thing as you have told me today?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When I first started to ask you about this, Mr. Tomlinson,\r\nyou initially identified stretcher A as the one which came off of the\r\nelevator car?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes; I think it's just like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, then, when----\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON (interrupting). Here's the deal--I rolled that thing\r\noff, we got a call, and went to second floor, picked the man up and\r\nbrought him down. He went on over across, to clear out of the emergency\r\narea, but across from it, and picked up two pints of, I believe it\r\nwas, blood. He told me to hold for him, he had to get right back to\r\nthe operating room, so I held, and the minute he hit there, we took\r\noff for the second floor and I came back to the ground. Now, I don't\r\nknow how many people went through that--I don't know how many people\r\nhit them--I don't know anything about what could have happened to them\r\nin between the time I was gone, and I made several trips before I\r\ndiscovered the bullet on the end of it there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You think, then, that this could have been either, you\r\ntook out of the elevator as you sit here at the moment, or you just\r\ncan't be sure?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It could be, but I can't be positive or positively\r\nsure--I think it was A, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, before I started to ask you questions under oath,\r\nwhich have been taken down here, I told you, did I not, that the Secret\r\nService man wrote a report where he said that the bullet was found on\r\nthe stretcher which you took off of the elevator--I called that to your\r\nattention, didn't I?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes; you told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, after I tell you that, does that have any effect on\r\nrefreshing your recollection of what you told the Secret Service man?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No; it really doesn't--it really doesn't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, would it be a fair summary to say that when I first\r\nstarted to talk to you about it, your first view was that the stretcher\r\nyou took off of the elevator was stretcher A, and then I told you that\r\nthe Secret Service man said it was--that you had said the stretcher you\r\ntook off of the elevator was the one that you found the bullet off,\r\nand when we talked about the whole matter and talked over the entire\r\nsituation, you really can't be completely sure about which stretcher\r\nyou took off of the elevator, because you didn't push the stretcher\r\nthat you took off of the elevator right against the wall at first?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, there was a lot of confusion that day, which is what\r\nyou told me before?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Absolutely. And now, honestly, I don't remember telling\r\nhim definitely--I know we talked about it, and I told him that it could\r\nhave been. Now, he might have drawed his own conclusion on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You told the Secret Service agent that you didn't know\r\nwhere----\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON (interrupting). He asked me if it could have been brought\r\ndown from the second floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You got the stretcher from where the bullet came from,\r\nwhether it was brought down from the second floor?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. It could have been--I'm not sure whether it was A I took\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But did you tell the Secret Service man which one you\r\nthought it was you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I'm not clear on that--whether I absolutely made a\r\npositive statement to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You told him that it could have been B you took off of the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But, you don't remember whether you told him it was A you\r\ntook off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. I think it was A--I'm not really sure.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which did you tell the Secret Service agent--that you\r\nthought it was A that you took off of the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Really, I couldn't be real truthful in saying I told him\r\nthis or that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You just don't remember for sure whether you told him you\r\nthought it was A or not?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No, sir; I really don't remember. I'm not accustomed to\r\nbeing questioned by the Secret Service and the FBI and by you and they\r\nare writing down everything, I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's all right. I understand exactly what you are\r\nsaying and I appreciate it and I really just want to get your best\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nWe understand it isn't easy to remember all that went on, on a day like\r\nNovember 22d, and that a man's recollection is not perfect like every\r\nother part of a man, but I want you to tell me just what you remember,\r\nand that's the best you can do today, and I appreciate that, and so\r\ndoes the President's Commission, and that's all we can ask a man.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes, I'm going to tell you all I can, and I'm not going\r\nto tell you something I can't lay down and sleep at night with either.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know where the stretcher came from that you found\r\non the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No, sir; I do not. It could have come from two, it could\r\nhave come from three, it could have come from some other place.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You didn't see anybody put it there?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No, sir--it was on the elevator when I got there. There\r\nwasn't anyone on the elevator at the time when I keyed it off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say \"keyed it off,\" you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Put it in manual operation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Tomlinson, does it make any difference to you whether\r\nyou sign this deposition at the end or not?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. We very much appreciate your coming, Mr. Tomlinson. Thank\r\nyou very much. Those are all the questions I have.\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. All right. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion between counsel and the witness Tomlinson regarding a\r\nproposed exhibit.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On the record.\r\n\r\nNow that the deposition of Mr. Tomlinson has been concluded, I am\r\nhaving the paper marked as Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Mr. Tomlinson is present, and\r\nwill you identify this paper marked Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2 as the one\r\nwhich contains the diagram of the emergency room and the letters A and\r\nB of the stretchers we have been discussing?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. That's just the elevator lobby in emergency.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And this is the diagram which you drew for us?\r\n\r\nMr. TOMLINSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's all, and thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DIANA HAMILTON BOWRON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Diana Hamilton Bowron was taken at 2:05 p.m., on March\r\n24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Diana Bowron is present following\r\na verbal request that she appear here to have her deposition taken.\r\nDuring the course of deposition proceedings on March 20 and March 21,\r\nit came to my attention that Miss Bowron would have information of\r\nvalue to the Commission, and authorization was provided through the\r\nGeneral Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, for her deposition to be taken.\r\n\r\nMiss Bowron, the President's Commission is investigating the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and is interested in certain facts\r\nrelating to his treatment and presence at Parkland Memorial Hospital,\r\nand we have asked you to appear here to testify concerning your\r\nknowledge of his presence here.\r\n\r\nNow, I have shown you, have I not, the Executive order appointing the\r\nPresidential Commission and the resolution authorizing the taking of\r\ntestimony at depositions by Commission staff members, have I not?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing to have your deposition taken today\r\nwithout 3 days' written notice, as we ordinarily provide?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, are you willing to waive that technical requirement?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Will you stand up and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your permanent residence address, Miss Bowron?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. 1107 Brockbank, Dallas 29, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you spell that street name and speak up more loudly?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. B-r-o-c-k-b-a-n-k [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you. Are you a native of Dallas, or of some other\r\narea?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I am a native of England.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Since August 4, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what are the circumstances surrounding your employment\r\nhere at Parkland Memorial Hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I answered an advertisement in August and came over on a\r\nyear's contract and to work in the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you a registered nurse?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your educational background?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I went to private boarding school and to secondary school,\r\nand then I went through nurses training for 3 years and 3 months in\r\nEngland. I finished in February of last year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how old are you at the present time?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Twenty two.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have occasion to render assistance to President\r\nKennedy back on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I did; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your\r\nbeing called in to assist in that case?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I was assigned to work in the minor medicine and surgery\r\narea, and I was passing through major surgery, and I heard over the\r\nintercom that they needed carts out at the emergency room entrance, so\r\nthe orderly from the triage desk, which was passing through and he and\r\nI took one cart from major surgery and ran down the hall and by the\r\ncashier's desk there were some men I assume were Secret Service men.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you know at that time whom you were going to aid?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You later assumed they were Secret Service men?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes, sir, and they encouraged us to run down to the door.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have a stretcher with you at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was one stretcher or more than one stretcher being\r\nbrought forward at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. There was another stretcher being brought forward from the\r\nOB--GYN section.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's the obstetrics and gynecology section?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you wheeling one stretcher by yourself or was\r\nsome one helping?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, the orderly from the triage desk was helping us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was helping you?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Joe--I've forgotten what his last name is. I'm sorry. I\r\nknow his first name is Joe and he's on duty today.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was bringing the other stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I don't know, sir. I heard afterwards, that Dr. Midgett\r\ntook one stretcher. I don't know who was assisting him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is Dr. Midgett's first name?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Bill.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, where did you take your stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. To the left-hand side of the car as you are facing it, and\r\nwe had to move Governor Connally out first because he was in the front.\r\nWe couldn't get to the back seat. While all the Secret Service men were\r\nmoving Governor Connally I went around to the other side of the car to\r\ntry to help with the President and then we got him onto the second cart\r\nand then took him straight over to trauma room 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Trauma room No. 1?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And describe in a general way Governor Connally's\r\ncondition when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. He was very pale, he was leaning forward and onto Mrs.\r\nConnally but apparently--I didn't notice very much--I was more\r\nconcerned with the person in the back of the car--the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, in a general way, did you observe with respect\r\nto President Kennedy's condition?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. He was moribund--he was lying across Mrs. Kennedy's knee\r\nand there seemed to be blood everywhere. When I went around to the\r\nother side of the car I saw the condition of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You saw the condition of his what?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. The back of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was that condition?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Well, it was very bad--you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many holes did you see?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I just saw one large hole.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see a small bullet hole beneath that one large\r\nhole?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice any other wound on the President's body?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what action did you take at that time, if any?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I helped to lift his head and Mrs. Kennedy pushed me away\r\nand lifted his head herself onto the cart and so I went around back to\r\nthe cart and walked off with it. We ran on with it to the trauma room\r\nand she ran beside us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was in the trauma room when you arrived there?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Dr. Carrico.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did Dr. Carrico join you?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. At the--I couldn't really tell you exactly, but it\r\nwas inside major surgery. Miss Henchliffe, the other nurse who is\r\nassigned to major surgery, was in the trauma room already setting the\r\nI.V.'s--the intravenous bottles up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were there any other nurses present at that time when\r\nthe President arrived in the trauma area?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I don't think so, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any doctors present besides Dr. Carrico?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I didn't notice anybody--there may have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action did you observe Dr. Carrico take, if any?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. We tried to start an I.V. cutdown and I don't know whether\r\nit was his left or his right leg, and Miss Henchliffe and I cut off his\r\nclothing and then after that everybody just arrived at once and it was\r\nmore or less everybody sort of helping everybody else. We opened the\r\nchest tube trays and the venesectron trays.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long were you present in the emergency room No. 1?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I was in there until they needed some blood, which was the\r\nsecond lot of blood. I went--ran out across to the blood bank and came\r\nback and went into the trauma room. By that time they had decided that\r\nhe was dead, they said.\r\n\r\nAnd then, we stayed in there with him and cleaned him up, removed all\r\nof his clothing and put them all together and Miss Henchliffe gave them\r\nto one of the Secret Service men, and we stayed with the body until\r\nthe coffin came, and helped put him in there, and then we----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we\", whom do you mean by \"we\"?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Miss Henchliffe and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Anybody besides the two of you?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; there was an orderly called David Sanders who helped\r\nus to clean the floor, because there were leaves and sheets and\r\neverything was rather a mess on the floor and he came to clean the\r\nfloor for us so that it wouldn't look so bad when Mrs. Kennedy went in.\r\nAnd then Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be alone with him after the priests\r\nleft, so we all came out and sat there outside and she was alone with\r\nhim in the trauma room, and we didn't go in any more after that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him at any time after that?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir--only when they were wheeling him out in the\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What doctors were present during the time he was being\r\ntreated?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Dr. Carrico and--who else was there--there were so many.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you recall any of the names?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any other nurses present other than those you\r\nhave already mentioned?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Miss Standridge, Jeanette Standridge came in, Mrs.\r\nNelson--the supervisor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any other nurses present there?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Not that I could say, sir--I don't know the name of any.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. While the doctors were working on President Kennedy, did\r\nyou ever have any opportunity to observe his neck?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No; I didn't, until afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Until after what?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Until after they had pronounced him dead and we cleaned up\r\nand removed the trach tube, and indeed we were really too shocked to\r\nreally take much notice.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever see his neck prior to the time you removed\r\nthe trach tube?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you personally participate in removing President\r\nKennedy's body from the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir--I didn't touch him. We held him with the sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present when his body was removed from the\r\nstretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you observe the stretcher from which his body was\r\nremoved to be the same stretcher that he had been brought into trauma\r\nroom No. 1 on?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's the stretcher you took out there for him?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what sheets were present on the stretcher or in the\r\nadjacent area used in the care of President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. The sheets that had already been on the stretcher when we\r\ntook it out with the President on. When we came back after all the work\r\nhad been done on him--so that Mrs. Kennedy could have a look before\r\nhe was, you know, really moved into the coffin. We wrapped some extra\r\nsheets around his head so it wouldn't look so bad and there were some\r\nsheets on the floor so that nobody would step in the blood. Those were\r\nput down during all the work that was going on so the doctors wouldn't\r\nslip.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with all of the sheets on the stretcher and\r\non floor area there?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. They were all gathered up and put into a linen scape.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you gather them up yourself?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All of them?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; with the help of Miss Henchliffe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did the two of you put them in the linen hamper?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; I put them in the linen hamper myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with the stretcher then?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. The stretcher was then wheeled across into trauma room No.\r\n2, which was empty.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there anything on the stretcher at all when it was\r\nwheeled into trauma room No. 2?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Not that we noticed, except the rubber mattress that was\r\nleft on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you have noticed anything had anything been on that\r\nstretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where was the stretcher when you last saw it?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Being wheeled across into trauma room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I am going to show you three photostatic copies of\r\nnewspaper stories which I will ask the Court Reporter to mark Bowron\r\nExhibit Nos. 2, 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n(Instruments referred to marked by the Reporter as Bowron Exhibit Nos.\r\n2, 3, and 4, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you look at those and tell me whether or not those\r\nare photostatic copies of newspaper accounts of your story of this\r\nassassination day?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. They are photostatic copies of the articles that appeared\r\nin the newspapers, but they are not all my story.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What newspapers did they appear in?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I believe this is the \"Observer\".\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are referring to BX Number 2 and what city is that\r\npublished in?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. London.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And BX Number 3 came from where?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I think that this was \"The Mail--The Daily Mail\".\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Appearing in what city?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. It appears in all cities. It is a national newspaper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In England?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes; it is prepared in England.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about BX-4?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Well, this I think was \"The Mirror\" I think.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What city is The Mirror published in?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. That is a national newspaper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Appearing in England?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any stories in any other newspapers about you\r\nand your participation in the events of the day at Parkland?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I believe there was one--I think it was an Australian\r\npaper and Mrs. Nelson received a letter from there with an article and\r\nwhich was the same as I think--as this one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. BX-4?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And does that constitute all the stories which appeared\r\nabout your participation in this event?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, will you state briefly the circumstances under which\r\nthis information was obtained, if you know?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Mrs. Nelson spoke to me and told me that there had been\r\ntwo English reporters in Dallas who had been asking about me, and she\r\ntold them where to get in touch with me, and the next day they came to\r\nthe emergency room and wanted to speak to me and I said I couldn't tell\r\nthem anything other than I was from England, gave them my home address,\r\nand the fact that I had been present and I was the one who went out\r\nto the car and brought the President in and being with him until they\r\nfinished, and that was all that I told them.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you give them any information beyond that?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir; and they told me that there would probably be\r\nsome English reporters calling on my parents at home, and I am the only\r\nchild and my mother worries, so I called home the next--that night and\r\ntold my parents that I had been on duty and that there would probably\r\nbe some reporters calling on them, and they weren't to worry about it\r\nbut they weren't to say anything that--except that I had been on duty\r\nand that was all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you been interviewed by any representative of the\r\nFederal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By whom?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. I don't really know--he was an FBI agent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when was that?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. It was a week or two, I think, after the assassination.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did he ask you and what did you tell him?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. He asked us more or less the same questions you have asked\r\nus.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell him?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. The same as I told you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"us\", whom do you mean by \"us\"?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Mrs. Nelson was there and Miss Henchliffe and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you talked to any other representatives of the\r\nFederal Government prior to today?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did I discuss with you the purpose of the deposition\r\nand the nature of the questions that I would ask you immediately before\r\nwe went on the record with this being taken down by the Court Reporter?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you give me the same information which you have\r\nput on the record here today?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything to add that you think might be\r\nhelpful in any way to the Commission?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes. When we were doing a cutdown on the President's left\r\narm, his gold watch was in the way and they broke it--you know, undid\r\nit and it was slipping down and I just dropped it off of his hand and\r\nput it in my pocket and forgot completely about it until his body was\r\nbeing taken out of the emergency room and then I realized, and ran out\r\nto give it to one of the Secret Service men or anybody I could find and\r\nfound this Mr. Wright.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was that the same day?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Yes--he had only just gone through O.B.--I was just a few\r\nfeet behind him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think of anything else that might be of assistance\r\nto the Commission?\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming, Miss Bowron.\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you a lot.\r\n\r\nMiss BOWRON. All right, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARGARET M. HENCHLIFFE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Margaret M. Henchliffe was taken at 2 p.m., on March\r\n21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Miss Henchliffe, the purpose of our asking you to come in\r\ntoday is in connection with the investigation being conducted by the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. The\r\nCommission has not written to you because, we have learned from Mrs.\r\nDoris Nelson in the deposition taken yesterday that you have some\r\ninformation of value to provide to us so that the regular procedure has\r\nnot been followed of sending you a copy of the Executive order or of\r\nthe resolution concerning the procedures of the taking of testimony.\r\n\r\nPermit me to make those documents available to you.\r\n\r\n(Handed instruments to the Witness Henchliffe.)\r\n\r\nLet me say that since yesterday I have contacted Mr. J. Lee Rankin,\r\nGeneral Counsel, in Washington and he has authorized the taking of\r\nthis deposition by letter, which I received today, so that it has been\r\nauthorized, and the real question I have with you is whether it is all\r\nright with you to provide us with the information you have today, as\r\nopposed to sometime next week after you have had the 3 days' notice\r\nwhich you are entitled to if you want it?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. It is all right with me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it all right with you to proceed and have your\r\ndeposition taken today?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give\r\nbefore this Commission as it is holding deposition proceedings now will\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name, please?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Margaret M. Henchliffe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation or profession?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I am a nurse, registered nurse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where are you employed?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were you employed on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you notified on that date that the President was\r\non his way to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir; I didn't know it at the time until later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you first learn about it, if at all?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I found out who it was when I went out to get blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About what time of day was that?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well. I guess it was about 2 minutes after he came in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe him at some place in the hospital?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I was working with him in the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had he arrived in the emergency room when you first\r\narrived at the site of the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Do what?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you in the area of the emergency room before he came\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him actually wheeled into the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes; in fact, I helped wheel him on into trauma room 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, where was he when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. He was between trauma rooms 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him when he was brought into the hospital\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. At the emergency entrance--no. It was after he came\r\ninto the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He came into the emergency area?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And then you saw him and helped wheel him, you say, into\r\nthe emergency room No. 1?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who else was present at the time you first saw him\r\nwhen he had just come into the emergency area?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Let me see, I think Dr. Carrico was there--he was\r\nthere very shortly after--afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He was there when you arrived? Or arrived shortly after\r\nyou did?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, actually I went in ahead of the cart with him\r\nand I was the first one in with him, and just in a minute, or seconds,\r\nDr. Carrico came in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what other doctors arrived, if any?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Oh, gee. Let's see--there was Dr. Baxter, Dr. Perry,\r\nand you want all of them that were in the room?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you can remember them.\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Dr. Kemp Clark, Dr. Jenkins, Dr. Peters, Dr. Crenshaw,\r\nand there was some woman anesthetist that I don't know which--who it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe to be the President's condition when\r\nyou first saw him?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I saw him breathe a couple of times and that was all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see any wound anywhere on his body?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes, he was very bloody; his head was very bloody when\r\nI saw him at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever see any wound in any other part of his body?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. When I first saw him--except his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see any wound on any other part of his body?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes; in the neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you describe it, please?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. It was just a little hole in the middle of his neck.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. About how big a hole was it?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. About as big around as the end of my little finger.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any experience with bullet holes?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did that appear to you to be?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. An entrance bullet hole--it looked to me like.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could it have been an exit bullet hole?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I have never seen an exit bullet hole--I don't\r\nremember seeing one that looked like that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were the characteristics of the hole?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. It was just a little round--just a little round hole,\r\njust a little round jagged-looking--jagged a little bit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What experience have you had in observing bullet holes,\r\nMiss Henchliffe?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, we take care of a lot of bullet wounds down\r\nthere--I don't know how many a year.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever had any formal studies of bullet holes?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Oh, no; nothing except my experience in the emergency\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In what?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. In the emergency room is all.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done to the President after he arrived at the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well the first thing, his endotracheal tube was\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present all the time he was in the emergency room?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Except when I left out to get blood.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long were you gone?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Oh, about 3 minutes or so--3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you present when he was pronounced dead?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with the President's body after he was\r\npronounced to be dead?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, after the last rites were said, we then\r\nundressed him and cleaned him up and wrapped him up in sheets until the\r\ncoffin was brought.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And after the coffin arrived, what was done with his body?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. He was placed in the coffin.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What had he been on up until that time?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. An emergency room cart.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that also described as a stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. A stretcher--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you describe what this stretcher looked like?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, how do you describe a stretcher--it's just a\r\nlong----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Made of metal?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes; it's made of metal.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On roller wheels?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Roller wheels with a rubber mattress on it, rubber\r\ncovered mattress on it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And after he was taken off of the stretcher, what was left\r\non the stretcher at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Just some sheets and I guess there were some dirty\r\nsyringes and needles laying on it that we picked up.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That you picked up--where were they placed?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. We placed them on a tray and took them all out to the\r\nutility room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many sheets were there on the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, I am really not sure--there was probably about\r\ntwo or three.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And in what position were they all on the stretcher after\r\nPresident Kennedy's body was removed?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, one was covering the whole mattress and there\r\nwas one or two that we had left just under his head, that had been\r\nplaced under his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was done with those sheets?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. They were all rolled up and taken to the dirty linen\r\nhamper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know who took those to the dirty linen hamper?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. To the best of my knowledge, the orderly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who was he?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. David Sanders--is that his name?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was done with the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. It was rolled into the room across the hall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you actually see the stretcher that President Kennedy\r\nwas on rolled into the room across the hall?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And into which room was it rolled?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was that?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Emergency room No. 2?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, when it was rolled into emergency room 2, were the\r\nsheets still all on, or were they off at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I believe they were off.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it possible that the stretcher that Mr. Kennedy was on\r\nwas rolled with the sheets on it down into the area near the elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you sure of that?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I am positive of that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you anything to add that you think might be helpful\r\nto the Commission?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir; I don't think of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did I talk to you about the purpose of the Commission and\r\nthe same questions that I have been asking and the answers that you\r\nhave been giving for a few minutes before the Court reporter came in to\r\ntake this down in shorthand?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you give me the same information at that time?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. To the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming.\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Okay.\r\n\r\n(At this point the witness, Henchliffe, was thereupon excused from the\r\ndeposing room.)\r\n\r\n(In approximately 3 minutes thereafter the witness returned to the\r\ndeposing room and the deposition continued as follows:)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me ask you a couple of questions more, Miss\r\nHenchliffe, one other question, or two, before you go.\r\n\r\nWas the wound on the front of the neck surrounded by any blood?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any blood at all in that area?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was there about the wound, if you recall anything\r\nspecial, which gave you the impression it was an entrance wound?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, it was just a small wound and wasn't jagged like\r\nmost of the exit bullet wounds that I have seen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If there was a high-powered rifle, or a high-powered rifle\r\nwas going at a fast speed, as fast as 2,000 feet per second, which\r\nencountered only soft tissue in the body, would you have sufficient\r\nknowledge to know whether or not the appearance of that hole would be\r\nconsistent with an exit wound?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, from some information I received in talking to\r\nsomeone about guns later on, they said that this is possible. But you\r\nhave a small exit wound--you could have a small exit wound.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Under what circumstances?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. As you described--a very fast bullet that didn't hit\r\nanything but soft tissue going through.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have any other source of information or basis\r\nfor having an opinion whether it was an entrance wound or an exit wound\r\nother than that source of information you just described, plus your\r\ngeneral experience here at Parkland as a nurse?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you been at Parkland as a nurse?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, I have had emergency room experience for about 5\r\nyears here and a couple of years at Baylor Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the total sum of your experience?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. In the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what other experience have you had besides emergency\r\nroom experience?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Well, in the operating room here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long have you had operating room experience here?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. 3 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been a registered nurse altogether?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. 12 years--almost 12 years.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the source of information about the appearance\r\nof an exit wound from a high-powered gun which you have just described?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. I don't remember who I was talking to now. I was just\r\ntalking to someone one day about gunshots and after this report came\r\nout that said that any high-powered gun that this could happen.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That it could be an exit wound which looked very much like\r\nan entrance wound with the missile striking nothing but soft tissue?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you have anything else to add?\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMiss HENCHLIFFE. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DORIS MAE NELSON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Doris Mae Nelson was taken on March 20, 1964, at\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Nelson, this is Miss Oliver, the court reporter, and\r\nwill you raise your right hand and take the oath?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give in this proceeding\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Mrs. Doris Nelson is appearing\r\nto testify in this deposition proceeding conducted by the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy to provide\r\nwhatever facts, if any, she may know concerning the treatment received\r\nby President Kennedy and Governor Connally at Parkland Memorial\r\nHospital on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Doris Mae Nelson. Do you want my maiden name?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine, yes; what is your maiden name?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Morris, M-o-r-r-i-s [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Nelson, have you had an opportunity to view the\r\njoint resolution of the 88th Congress and the Executive order which\r\nestablished the President's Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; I read it yesterday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And have you had an opportunity to view the resolution of\r\nthe President's Commission covering questioning of witnesses by members\r\nof the Commission staff?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing to be questioned today concerning this\r\nmatter, even though you have not had 3 days' notice?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Therefore waiving the right which you have, a 3 days'\r\nnotice under the resolution?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your occupation or profession?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I am a registered nurse, supervisor of the emergency room\r\nat Parkland Memorial Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how long have you been so occupied?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. A year and 6 months as supervisor of the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were your duties in a general way on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I was primarily responsible for assigning personnel in the\r\ntreatment of the injured patients and carrying out security measures\r\nwith the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What notification, if any, did you receive on that date\r\nconcerning injuries to President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I received a phone call approximately 3 to 5 minutes\r\nprior to their arrival, from the telephone operator, stating that the\r\nPresident had been shot and was being brought to the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What action after that did you take in preparing for the\r\nPresident's arrival?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I immediately took the surgical resident into trauma room\r\nNo. 1, notified him of the incident, and asked the--also told the head\r\nnurse that the President had been shot and was being brought to the\r\nemergency room.\r\n\r\nThen, I went into trauma room 2, after the head nurse had told me that\r\ntrauma room 1 was set up for any emergency, and proceeded to open a\r\nbottle of intravenous fluid and set it up for an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you know at that time that anyone else had been\r\ninjured?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No; we were not notified as to anyone else being injured.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What occurred with respect to the arrival of any injured\r\nparty at Parkland Memorial Hospital thereafter?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. As I walked out of trauma room No. 2 I heard someone\r\ncalling for stretchers and an orderly ran back into the area and got\r\na stretcher and ran out of the door, and a few seconds later Governor\r\nConnally, who at that time I did not know who it was but recognized him\r\nas not being the President, arrived and I directed them into trauma\r\nroom 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did the orderly take out one stretcher, or was more than\r\none stretcher taken out?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. I do not know exactly how many stretchers were taken out\r\nat the time because I was not out at that area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did another stretcher come into the area?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; immediately behind the Governor another stretcher\r\nwas brought back into the emergency room and on this stretcher was\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How were you able to identify President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Well, I could look and see him and tell that it was him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What part did you see?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. The--mainly his head.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was there any coat covering his face?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. There was a coat thrown across the top of him, not\r\ncompletely covering his face, and Mrs. Kennedy--do you want me to tell\r\nabout Mrs. Kennedy and the flowers?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; continue. Yes; in answering the questions, Mrs.\r\nNelson, feel perfectly free to make as full an answer to the\r\nquestion--I hesitate to have you stop, so that the record we make will\r\nappear continuous and everything may be recorded fully for our record\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Mrs. Kennedy was walking beside the stretcher and the\r\nroses that she had been given at the airport were lying on top of the\r\nPresident and her hat was also lying on top of the President as he was\r\nbrought into the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was he then taken?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. He was immediately taken into trauma room 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who, if anyone, was present at that time to attend him\r\nin a medical way?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Dr. Carrico, a surgical resident was there at the time\r\nthat he was brought in, and Dr. Perry, an associate professor of\r\nsurgery arrived shortly thereafter, and several doctors arrived, Dr.\r\nBaxter, associate professor of surgery, Dr. Kemp Clark, professor of\r\nneurosurgery and chairman of the department; Dr. Bashour--\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Spell, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. B-a-s-h-o-u-r (spelling), chairman of the Department of\r\nCardiology, and several other doctors who I cannot recall all the names\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you present inside of the emergency room where\r\nPresident Kennedy was taken?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. When what?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you in there at the time they were treating him,\r\ncaring for him at any time?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. On one occasion I went into the room and this was mainly\r\nto ask Mrs. Kennedy if she had rather wait out in the hallway rather\r\nthan in the room where they were treating the President, and I was told\r\nby the Secret Service agent that she may stay in there if she wished.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any table, or was there any table in the\r\nemergency room to which President Kennedy was taken that he could be\r\nplaced on from the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is it the normal situation to have no table present in the\r\nemergency room?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. The only one there is in case an ambulance should bring\r\na patient in, but if a patient comes in the emergency room on a\r\nstretcher, then the stretcher that is in there is removed. Then the\r\npatient remains on the same stretcher that he comes into the emergency\r\nroom on.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was there a stretcher in the emergency room at the\r\ntime President Kennedy was taken in on a second stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. It was taken out when they wheeled it in.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there any sheets on the stretcher that President\r\nKennedy was on?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. After President Kennedy was taken off of the stretcher,\r\ndid you have occasion to observe that stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; the stretcher was stripped by the nursing personnel\r\nworking in the room and the stretcher was moved across from trauma room\r\n1 to trauma room 2 in order to get the stretcher out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What personnel stripped the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Margaret Henchliffe, H-e-n-c-h-l-i-f-f-e [spelling], and\r\nDiana Bowron, D-i-a-n-a B-o-w-r-o-n [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you actually observe Diana Bowron or Margaret\r\nHenchliffe strip the stretcher?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No; I did not. This was the report that I received\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From whom did you receive that report?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. From these two nurses.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see the stretcher after it was stripped in the\r\nemergency room to which President Kennedy was taken?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No, I saw it after it was wheeled from trauma room 1 to\r\ntrauma room 2, because I was standing there at the doorway between the\r\ntwo rooms with the Secret Service Police.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But it was actually in trauma room 1?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As it was being wheeled out to trauma room 2 and at the\r\ntime it was being wheeled out, was there any sheet on it at all----\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Rolled up on it in any way at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see where the stretcher was then placed?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes, it was put into trauma room 2.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was President Kennedy's body at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. It was in--it had been placed in a casket in trauma room 1.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was the casket on any sort of an object or was it on\r\nthe floor or what?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. It was on a form of roller-type table.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did--do you know what President Kennedy's body was in,\r\nif anything, at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes, one of the nurses, Miss Hutton, came out and said\r\nthat the President was having extensive bleeding from the head and they\r\nhad wrapped four sheets around it but it was still oozing through, so\r\nI sent her to the second floor to obtain a mattress cover, a plastic\r\nmattress cover, to put in the casket prior to putting his body in the\r\ncasket, so the mattress cover was placed in the casket and I did not\r\nsee this happen, but this is how it was explained to me by the nurse,\r\nand the plastic was placed on the mattress cover and the cover was\r\naround the mattress.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which nurse explained that to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Miss Bowron and Miss Henchliffe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what was done with the sheets which had been used to\r\nabsorb the blood from the President's body?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Well, there were approximately four sheets wrapped around\r\nhim and the remaining sheets that were on the stretcher were pulled\r\nup and thrown in the linen hamper, according to Miss Bowron and Miss\r\nHenchliffe.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where is that linen hamper located?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. That linen hamper is located in the utility room area of\r\nthe emergency room, which is just outside of the trauma room area.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what floor is that on?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. On the ground floor of the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was done with Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Governor Connally was in the emergency room for a very\r\nshort period, approximately 15 to 20 minutes, at which time he had\r\nchest tubes inserted, intravenous fluid started, anesthesia or oxygen\r\ngiven to him, and he was taken immediately from the emergency room to\r\nthe operating room accompanied by several doctors.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him inside trauma room No. 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you observe him when he was taken out of trauma\r\nroom No. 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes, I saw him when he went upstairs to the operating room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how did he get upstairs to the operating room?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. On a stretcher carried by several of the doctors. Miss\r\nStandridge went in front, and opened doorways and went to the elevator.\r\nI could not see her at the elevator but this is what she told me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How far could you see her?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Oh, approximately 30 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And who is Miss Standridge?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Head nurse in the emergency room.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is her first name?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Jeanette.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You say the stretcher was carried?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Well, it was wheeled.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what does the stretcher look like that Governor\r\nConnally was on?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Well, there are no specific details, it's an average type\r\nof movable four-wheel stretcher, made out of metal, with a plastic\r\nmattress on the stretcher. It has an elevation between--on the sides,\r\nso that the--I don't know how to explain exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. A bumper-type effect?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. It has a bumper on the side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there a tray underneath the place where the body was\r\nresting?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the same general description of a stretcher\r\nthat President Kennedy was brought in on?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; they were the same type.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Nelson, I'm going to show you a four-page statement\r\nwhich is marked \"Activities of Doris Nelson, R.N., beginning 12 noon,\r\nFriday, November 22, 1963,\" after I ask that it be marked as an exhibit\r\nin connection with this deposition.\r\n\r\n(Reporter marked the instrument referred to as Nelson Exhibit No. 1.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this a photostatic copy of the statement which you gave\r\nto Mr. Jack Price, the administrator of the hospital, concerning your\r\nactivities on November 22, 1963, as they pertain to this matter?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are the facts set forth herein true and correct to the\r\nbest of your knowledge, information and belief?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; they are.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did I meet with you for a few moments before we started\r\nthis deposition and explain the purpose of the proceeding?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; you did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did I ask you the same questions which we have discussed\r\nhere during the course of my questioning before the court reporter?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for providing this deposition to us.\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. You are quite welcome.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record between Mr. Specter and the witness, Mrs.\r\nDoris Nelson.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Back on the record, just a minute.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nelson, I will ask you if you would sign the end of this statement\r\nhere, that it is your statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. (Signed statement referred to.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you willing to waive a requirement, if it is any\r\nformal requirement, as to the signing of this deposition?\r\n\r\nMrs. NELSON. Yes; I am.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CHARLES JACK PRICE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Charles Jack Price was taken at 4:50 p.m., on March\r\n25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen\r\nSpecter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that C. Jack Price is present to have\r\nhis deposition taken in connection with the inquiry of the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which is\r\nconcerned with the medical care rendered at Parkland Memorial Hospital\r\nto President John F. Kennedy and to Governor John B. Connally.\r\n\r\nAuthorization has been obtained to take the deposition of Mr. Price\r\nand he has had access to the copy of the Executive order creating the\r\nPresident's Commission----\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the rules relating to the taking of depositions of\r\nwitnesses. Is it satisfactory with you to have your deposition taken\r\nwithout having the 3-day waiting period between the request and the\r\ntaking of the deposition?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you stand up, Mr. Price, and raise your right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the\r\nPresident's Commission and in this deposition proceeding will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you state your full name for the record, please?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Charles Jack Price.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your official title here?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Administrator, Dallas County Hospital district, comprised of\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital and Woodlawn Hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mr. Price, in connection with your duties at Parkland\r\nMemorial Hospital, did you request that all of the individuals who\r\nparticipated in the care and treatment of President Kennedy and\r\nGovernor Connally, or at least those who were principally concerned\r\nwith that treatment, prepare and submit reports to you concerning that\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; through Dr. Kemp Clark, who is chairman of our medical\r\nrecords committee.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where have those records been kept after submission\r\nthrough Dr. Kemp Clark?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. The records were brought directly to my office. In fact,\r\nsome of the records were written in my office and since that time have\r\nbeen kept in my custody, specifically under lock and key in my desk\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I show you a document which has heretofore been marked as\r\n\"Commission Exhibit No. 392,\" and I ask you if this constitutes all of\r\nthe records of the doctors who examined and treated President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally which are in your possession, that is all the\r\nrecords which were made by the examining doctors?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. (Examining instrument referred to.) Do you want my comments\r\nas I go through this or do you want me to look through it and say\r\n\"Yes,\" or \"No\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; I would like to just be sure for the record that\r\nthose are all of the records. You and I went through them the other day\r\ninformally and at that time you supplemented my records to some extent,\r\nwhich I will put on the deposition record here.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Perhaps, before going to Commission Exhibit No. 392,\r\npermit me to have this photostatic copy marked Mr. Price's Exhibit No.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 2,\r\nfor identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I ask you if this is a photostatic copy of a letter\r\nwhich was sent by Dr. Kemp Clark to Dr. Burkley, the President's\r\nprivate physician?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And with that, the summary of all the treatments performed\r\nat Parkland, which was prepared by Dr. Kemp Clark?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And below that, another summary sheet which bears the\r\ncorrected notation, with your signature over it, that the President\r\narrived at the emergency room at exactly 12:38 p.m., with 12:43\r\nscratched out?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, as you move through your file, permit me to also ask\r\nthe reporter to mark as Mr. Price's Exhibit No. 3, an affidavit of Ulah\r\nMcCoy, and I'll ask you if that is a copy of an original in your file?\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 3,\r\nfor identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I will ask her to mark as Mr. Price Exhibit No. 4\r\nan affidavit of Doris Nelson and I'll ask you if that is a copy of a\r\nreport in your possession?\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 4,\r\nfor identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Your next report is one from Dr. M. T. Jenkins?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Professor and chairman of the department of anesthesiology.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a copy of the document which you are looking\r\nat here?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As part of Exhibit 392?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. That's right, and my next one is the statement of Dr. W.\r\nKemp Clark.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the original of a copy of which appears in\r\nthis group of papers as Exhibit No. 392?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is. The next one that I have is the statement of Dr.\r\nPerry.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that the original of a copy of a statement which\r\nappears in Exhibit 392?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; the statement of Dr. Charles W. Baxter.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that the original of a copy which appears in Exhibit\r\n392?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is; that's the statement of Dr. Carrico.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is this the copy of the original of Dr. Carrico's\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is; and this is Dr. McClelland's statement.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a photostatic copy of what purports to be\r\nDr. McClelland's statement, and is that a copy of the original in your\r\nfile?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is your next report?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. My next report is Dr. Bashour's report.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And I show you a sheet in the group of papers marked\r\nExhibit 392, and ask you if that is a photostatic copy of the original\r\nin your file?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is next?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. My next one is the summary of Dr. Ronald C. Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I'll ask you if this is a photostatic copy of the\r\noriginal of the statement by Dr. Ronald Jones which is in your file?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. May I see it, please?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Handed instrument referred to to the witness.)\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, does that constitute all of the original records\r\nconcerning the treatment of President John F. Kennedy in your file?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. With one exception--there is in the file that I have of\r\nGovernor Connally the original of the transcript of \"Registration of\r\npatients,\" which I furnished you a photostat of, our number being 01811.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is this a photostatic copy of that registration of\r\npatients?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. It is; and I think I reviewed it with you at the time I gave\r\nthis to you--the transverse of patients No. 2 and No. 5.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. No. 5 is marked John Connally and No. 2 is John F.\r\nKennedy, and how should that have been marked?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. The first patient in the hospital was Governor Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, he should have been No. 2?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. So, he should have been No. 2 as shown on the transcript.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And the President should have been noted as No. 5?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. The President should have been noted as No. 5.\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 5,\r\nfor identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. The simultaneous arrival at the ambulance dock would not\r\naffect the time as shown in the corrected copy that I gave you of the\r\narrival there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, turn if you will, to the records on Governor Connally\r\nand I will ask you if as part of Commission Exhibit 392, we have\r\nphotostatic copies of the operative records starting, first with the\r\noperation performed by Dr. Shaw.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. I have the original of that but this is the complete medical\r\ncharts that I have here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. As to this report alone, do you have the original in that\r\nrecord?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Here it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is this an exact photocopy of the original report\r\nprepared by Dr. Robert Shaw, the original of which appears in your\r\nrecord on Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. It is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is this an exact photostatic copy of the report of Dr.\r\nCharles Gregory?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. There has been since this photostat was made and forwarded\r\nto you--Dr. Gregory, prior to signing the official copy, did make some\r\npencil corrections, and I will be glad to have the original photostated\r\nor Xeroxed now and give you a corrected copy if you would like?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would be fine, and perhaps it would be faster just to\r\nread those changes into our record here. However, let's pursue the line\r\nof getting a Xerox copy.\r\n\r\nNow, turning to the report of Dr. Shires, is this a true and correct\r\nphotostatic copy of Dr. Shires' report?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. It is; it is a correct copy.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, I show you a large group of papers which I am going\r\nto ask the reporter to mark Mr. Price Exhibits Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9.\r\n\r\n(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibits Nos.\r\n6, 7, 8, and 9, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now show you a group of papers, and as they are being\r\nmarked, if you would take a look at them. Price Exhibit No. 6--I'll\r\nask you if these are photostatic copies of reports which you have\r\nmade available to me of originals which you have in your file made by\r\nvarious members of your staff, concerning the events of November 22,\r\nand November 24.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Do you want these individually or as a group?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you would identify the contents of the statement by\r\nthe exhibit number which we have put on it, starting with the first\r\nnumerical designation, would probably be the simplest. Exhibit 6 is\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Exhibit No. 6 is a Xerox copy of the floor plan of the\r\nemergency area. This is correct.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibit No. 7, the statement is unsigned, but this is the Xerox\r\ncopy of the summary submitted to me by my assistant, Mr. Steve\r\nLandregan.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is his position with the hospital?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. He is assistant administrator.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In charge of press relations among other things?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. In charge of press relations among other things.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is Exhibit No. 8?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Exhibit No. 8 is a Xerox copy of Peter Geilich's statement\r\nto me. Mr. Geilich is administrative assistant, with primary assignment\r\nover at the Woodlawn unit, and he is also the acting director of our\r\noutpatient clinic.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER.

Yes; they are. These are primarily the summaries of\r\nindividuals who were involved in the care of our late President, in\r\nthe care of Governor Connally, and in the care of Oswald, who were\r\nrequested to make these summaries to my office as their activities\r\nwould not normally be stated on patients' charts or in other records of\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I now hand you Price Exhibit No. 35 and ask you if that is\r\na photostatic copy of the report of Dr. Charles Gregory, after it was\r\naltered in a few minor respects as shown on the face of the record?\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Well, if I may change this terminology?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Sure.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. This is a copy of Dr. Charles Gregory's records as it\r\nappears in Governor Connally's charts, which he corrected prior to\r\nsigning the transcript. What I was trying to say, or wanted to make\r\nclear, was that frequently in transcribing, the medical secretaries\r\nwho transcribe operative records, they make mistakes, and I wanted to\r\nbe sure that there was no suggestion that the record was altered, when\r\nwhat Dr. Gregory has done was to write in corrections that were noticed\r\nat the time he read it and signed it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I understand it was transcribed, and when he reviewed it\r\nbefore signing it he noticed inaccuracies in the transcription.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. That's right. This is correct. Your phraseology is much\r\nbetter than mine.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Price.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That's all. I wanted to put all of these in the record,\r\nJack, to show that they are duly authenticated by the appropriate\r\ncustodian of the records.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. Well, I wanted to be sure that there was no hint that the\r\nrecord had been altered here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; I understand that. I think you are absolutely right\r\non that. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. PRICE. All right. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MALCOLM O. COUCH\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Malcolm O. Couch was taken at 9:43 a.m., on April 1,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you please rise and raise your right hand and be sworn,\r\nsir?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Be seated, please.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are Malcolm O. Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Couch, we are taking your deposition here in Dallas\r\nto record your testimony for the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you request that an attorney be present here to represent\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We have written you about the taking of this deposition\r\nand I assume that you have waived notice of the taking of the\r\ndeposition--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Couch, you have the right to look at the deposition and\r\nsign it, or you can follow the general custom and rely on the court\r\nreporter and waive the signing of the deposition--whatever you would\r\nlike to do. If you would like to sign it, you can; if you want to waive\r\nsigning it, you can also. Whatever you want to do.\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. All right. I'll sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You want to sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. Couch, where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. 4215 Live Oak in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And how old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Twenty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And were you born in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; born in Dallas and raised in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what is your educational background? Did you go through\r\nhigh school?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I went to Woodrow Wilson High School here in Dallas, I\r\nhave a Bachelor of Arts degree from John Brown University; and I will\r\nreceive a Master of Theology degree this May from Dallas Seminary.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You then plan, when you receive your Master of Theology\r\ndegree, to become a minister?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I will be ordained. I don't know if I will have a church or\r\nnot, but I will be ordained.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you married, Mr. Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any family at all?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; one boy--since last Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Since last Friday? Well, congratulations to you. I assume\r\nyour wife and baby are doing well?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you major in at college?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Social science.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your present occupation, Mr. Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Part-time television news cameraman with WFAA-TV in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say \"part time,\" do you mean you're going to school\r\npart time----\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And spending part time with WFAA-TV?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long have you been employed by WFAA-TV?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--for 2 years straight. But I worked with them full and\r\npart time, I believe, back in--starting in 1955 to 1957.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then what happened in 1957?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I went to college.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went to college full time?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you got out in 1961?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I got out in January 1960.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. January 1960?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes--and came back to Dallas and went into graduate school\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And when you came back to Dallas, you went to work with\r\nWFAA-TV?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; no. I began going to Dallas Seminary, but--uh--I\r\nworked for Keitz & Herndon Film Studios--[spelling] K-e-i-t-z and\r\nH-e-r-n-d-o-n.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you had any other jobs since you've gotten out of\r\ncollege other than those?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I worked a year for Camp Elhar, as executive director of the\r\ncamp. It's a Christian camp here in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is this for youngsters?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Boys and girls?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And when did that employment take place?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--I believe it was September 1961--and ended in September\r\n1962. I started working for WFAA in March of 1962. And I've been there\r\n2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, part of the time while you were working with\r\nthis camp, you were also part time with WFAA-TV?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then when you started to work on your Masters in\r\nTheology, you stopped working?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No. I started work on my Masters when I came back from\r\ncollege----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Oh, I see.\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. In January of 1960. It's a 4-year course.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. Couch, I want to take you back to November 22, 1963, and ask you\r\nwhether or not you were employed by WFAA-TV at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In connection with your employment, what is the fact as to\r\nwhether or not you had anything to do with the coverage of the visit of\r\nPresident Kennedy to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you just state what your duties were and what you did\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I was assigned to cover the arrival of the President at the\r\nairport and to ride in the motorcade through town and, then, to ride\r\nwith the motorcade of the President back to the airport when he left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, when you were assigned, were you assigned as a\r\nreporter, as a photographer, or in what capacity?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. As a photographer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this be moving picture film or still shots, or both?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Moving only.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Moving picture film only?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you at Love Field in Dallas when the President arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you take moving pictures of him there?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you got in the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And the motorcade proceeded, first, from Love Field toward\r\ndowntown Dallas--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember the route you took through downtown Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--roughly. It was out through the airport parkway to\r\nMockingbird Lane to Lemmon, down Lemmon to Turtle Creek, down Turtle\r\nCreek to--uh--I'm not sure of those streets. I think McKinney or Cedar\r\nSprings. I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, if you aren't particularly sure--okay. What about when\r\nyou got downtown to the center of Dallas? Do you remember what streets\r\nyou went on?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes. Well, we came in on Harwood and then turned right on\r\nMain at the City Hall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you took Main to where?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Main down to--uh--Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. You were heading, now, west on Main down to\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About where in the motorcade was your car? Do you remember\r\noffhand?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh-uh--roughly--and I'm not sure--the fifth or sixth car\r\nback from the lead car. I'm not sure which one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, do you remember, as you approached Houston Street on\r\nMain about how fast the motorcade was going?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I would estimate--uh--20 miles an hour. The speed had picked\r\nup some. Everyone gave a sigh a relief that--uh--it was over; and one\r\nof the cameramen, I remember, his camera broke and another one was out\r\nof film. Everyone was relaxed. And--uh--of course, then we turned\r\nnorth on Houston, and it was there that we heard the first gunshot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Before we get to the first gunshot--do you\r\nremember who was riding in the car with you?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--an best I can, it was Jimmy Darnell--Channel 5: uh--Bob\r\nJackson--Times Herald; Jim Underwood--KRLD-TV; and the fellow--uh--Mr.\r\nDillard--Tom Dillard--Dallas Morning News. And the driver of the car; I\r\ndon't know his name.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you sitting in the front or the back seat?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Sitting in the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about your position as to the way\r\nyou were sitting in the back?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; I was almost in the middle and sitting on the--it was a\r\nconvertible--and sitting on the back of the back seat, with my feet on\r\nthe seat.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your feet were on the seat--and you would be sitting on the\r\ntop of the back seat?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There were three of you in the back?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; three in the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And were you in the middle or to the right or to the left?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I was about in the middle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, as you turned north on Houston, do you\r\nremember about how fast you were going?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, I'd say still that--of course, allowing for the\r\nturn--that the pace of the motorcade was about the same. We were\r\nclipping along and, as I said, I do have films after we had turned the\r\nother corner, and you could still see that the motorcade was moving\r\nfairly fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were there any motorcycle policemen riding alongside the\r\nmotorcade, that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; there were.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember the names of any of those people?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were they two-wheel or three-wheel motorcycles?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Two-wheel.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there one riding alongside of your car?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--he was. I remember distinctly one was on my right going\r\ndown Main. They would jockey from time to time in different positions.\r\nAs I recall, on Houston, I don't remember any beside us on Houston.\r\nAs I say, they would fade back and forth. Sometimes they would be;\r\nsometimes they wouldn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, as you turned onto Houston, you said that you heard what you\r\ndescribed as a----\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. It sounded like a motorcycle backfire at first--the first\r\ntime we heard it--the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember about where your car was at the time you\r\nheard the first noise?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I would say--uh--15 or 20 feet from the turn--from off of\r\nMain onto Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Fifteen or 20 feet from the turn?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. We had already completed the turn.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After you had completed the turn, then 15 or 20 feet further\r\non you heard the first shot--the first noise?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Because, I remember I was talking and we were laughing and I\r\nwas looking back to a fellow on my--that would be on my right--I don't\r\nknow who it was--we were joking. We had just made the turn. And I heard\r\nthe first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What happened--or what did anyone say?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. As I recall, nothing--there was no particular reaction;\r\nuh--nothing unusual. Maybe everybody sort of looked around a little,\r\nbut didn't think much of it. And--uh--then, in a few seconds, I guess\r\nfrom 4-5 seconds later, or even less, we heard the second shot. And\r\nthen we began to look--uh, not out of thinking necessarily it was a\r\ngunshot, but we began to look in front of us--in the motorcade in front\r\nof us. And, as I recall, I didn't have any particular fears or feelings\r\nat the second shot. By the third shot, I felt that it was a rifle.\r\nAlmost sure it was. And, as I said, the shots or the noises were fairly\r\nclose together they were fairly even in sound--and--uh, by then, one\r\ncould recognize, or if he had heard a high-powered rifle, he would feel\r\nthat it was a high-powered rifle. You would get that impression.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember where your vehicle was by the time you heard\r\nthe third shot?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I'd say we were about 50 feet from making--or maybe 60\r\nfeet--from making the left-hand turn onto Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear more than three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you heard any noises, what you'd describe like a\r\nmotorcycle backfiring or firecrackers, prior to the time that you made\r\nyour turn north onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, way uptown on Main Street, a motorcycle did backfire\r\nright beside us--and we all jumped and had a good laugh over it. And\r\nthe three shots sounded, at first--the first impression was that this\r\nwas another motorcycle backfiring.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, between the first and the second shots, is there\r\nanything else you remember doing or you remember hearing or seeing that\r\nyou haven't related here at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Nothing unusual between the shots. Uh--as I say, the first\r\nshot, I had no particular impression; but the second shot, I remember\r\nturning--several of us turning--and looking ahead of us. It was unusual\r\nfor a motorcycle to backfire that close together, it seemed like. And\r\nafter the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall, on my right,\r\nyelled something like, \"Look up in the window! There's the rifle!\"\r\n\r\nAnd I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which at the\r\ntime impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and seeing about a\r\nfoot of a rifle being--the barrel brought into the window.\r\n\r\nI saw no one in that window--just a quick 1-second glance at the barrel.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what building was that?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. This was the Texas Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At the corner of Houston and Elm in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said it was the sixth or the seventh floor. Do you know\r\nhow many floors there are in that building--or did you know at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I didn't know at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it look like to you he was on the top floor or next to\r\nthe top floor or the second to the top floor--or----\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. It looked like it was the top. And when you first glance\r\nat the building, you're thrown off a little as to the floors because\r\nthere's a ridge--uh, it almost looks like a structure added onto the\r\ntop of the building, about one story above. So, you have to recount.\r\n\r\nOf course, at the time, I wasn't counting, but----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You just remember, to the best of your recollection, that it\r\nwas either the sixth or seventh floor?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And when you say, \"the far right\"----\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That would be the far east.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The far east of what side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. The south side of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether or not that window at which you saw\r\nthe rifle, you say, being withdrawn--first of all, could you tell it\r\nwas a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes, I'd say you could. Uh--if a person was just standing on\r\nthe--as much as I saw, if the factors that did happen, did not happen,\r\nyou might not say that it was a rifle. In other words, if you just saw\r\nan object being pulled back into a window, you wouldn't think anything\r\nof it. But with the excitement intense right after that third shot and\r\nwhat Bob yelled, my impression was that it was a rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything more than a steel barrel of a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you tell whether or not the rifle had any telescopic\r\nsight on it?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any of the stock of the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any person pulling the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether or not, if you can remember, the\r\nwindow was open or halfway open or what?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. It was open. To say that it was half or three-quarters open,\r\nI wouldn't say. My impression was that it was all the way open--but\r\nthat was an impression.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything else in the window that you\r\nremember--any boxes or anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You didn't notice whether there was or was not--or do you\r\ndefinitely remember that you did not notice any?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I didn't notice anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any other people in any other windows in the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; I recall seeing--uh--some people standing in some of\r\nthe other windows--about, roughly, third or fourth floor in the middle\r\nof the south side. I recall one--it looked like a Negro boy with a\r\nwhite T-shirt leaning out one of those windows looking up--up to the\r\nwindows up above him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh. Is there anything else you can remember about the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; that's just about the only impression I had at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you related what you heard Bob Jackson say. Did anyone\r\nelse say anything in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No one else said anything, that I recall, about a rifle, or\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the car when you saw this rifle being withdrawn?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I'd say about 25 feet before we made the turn onto Elm. Our\r\ncar was facing the south side of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Then what happened after Bob Jackson made his\r\nexclamation and you saw what you just related?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, I picked up my camera. As I recall, I had it in my\r\nhand, but it was down leaning against my legs. And I picked it up and\r\nmade a quick glance at a setting and raised it to my eye. And--uh--you\r\ncan see from my film that we're just turning the corner. We start\r\nthe turn and we turn the corner, and you can see people running. As\r\nI recall, there's a quick glance at the front entrance of the Texas\r\nDepository Book Building. You can see people running and you can see\r\nabout the first three cars, maybe four, in front of me as we complete\r\nthe turn.\r\n\r\nAnd then I took pictures of--uh--a few people on my left and a group,\r\nor a sweeping, of the crowd on my right standing on the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you take any pictures of the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding itself?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Not of the south side at that moment.\r\n\r\nAfter we went, say, 50 to 75 feet on down Elm, uh--we began to hang\r\non because the driver picked up speed. We got down under the--I think\r\nthere's three trestles there, three crossings underneath the--uh--at\r\nthe very bottom of Elm Street----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what they call the triple-underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nAnd--uh--I think, as I recall, right after we'd made the turn on Elm,\r\none or two of the fellows jumped out. But after we got all the way down\r\nunderneath the three trestles we finally persuaded the driver--who\r\nwasn't too anxious to stop--to stop and--uh--we all jumped out.\r\n\r\nAnd I ran, I guess it was about 75 yards or a little more back up to\r\nthe School Depository Building and took some sweeping pictures of the\r\ncrowd standing around. I didn't stay there long.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you take any pictures of the Depository Building\r\nentrance?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No--uh----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you came back up there?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Not with determination. I cannot recall at this moment\r\nwhether some of my pictures I took when I ran back might have a\r\nsweeping shot of the entrance through a wide angle lens. But not with\r\ndetermination. I didn't plan to take pictures of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would these shots--these wide angle lens shots, if anyone\r\nwere standing in front of the building or leaving the building at that\r\ntime, would you be able to identify them, or would they be too far away?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. They would be too far away. Possibly if the frames were\r\nblown up, one might determine if someone was standing there--identify\r\nsomeone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how many minutes after the last shot would you say you\r\ncame back to take these pictures?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, I'd say it took me--uh--maybe a minute and a half to\r\nget back to there after this third shot--because we weren't but seconds\r\ngetting down underneath that underpass after we made the turn.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. And--uh--I jumped out and ran back. So, I'd say not over a\r\nminute and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you started taking general sweeping shots of the\r\narea?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were most of the shots directed at people along the side\r\nthere as to what their reactions were, or were most of the shots\r\ndirected at the School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Mostly of the people standing around, the policemen and\r\nshots such as this.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what direction, generally, would the camera have been\r\npointed, and where would you have been standing when you took these\r\npictures?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Some of the pictures, I remember, the camera was pointing\r\nsouth--because I was standing on the little knoll which is just at\r\nthe foot and west of the Depository Building, where the little park\r\narea begins. There's a sidewalk that runs between the Book Depository\r\nproperty, I would assume and the park. And I was standing on that\r\nlittle sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And your camera was pointing south?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Pointing south. That's right. Now, after I had taken I don't\r\nknow how many feet of film of people standing around, I--uh--we--I\r\nthink there was one or two other fellows with me and who they were,\r\nnow, I can't remember; they were photographers--we stopped a car\r\nthat was going by with a boy in it--a young boy of about high school\r\nage--and asked him to take us out to Parkland. And as the car started\r\noff, I started my camera and I have a sweeping shot moving west from\r\nabout--uh--maybe the middle of the Book Depository Building from ground\r\nlevel on past the park area--a sweeping shot with the car moving.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And that's about it insofar as the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding is concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, no. After we got out to Stemmons--they'd set up a\r\nroadblock just as you entered Stemmons Expressway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. We jumped out of the car and I took, I believe it was, a\r\n2-inch lens shot of the Book Depository Building of the west wall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Of the west wall?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Not of the front entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any particular reason, Mr. Couch, why you didn't\r\ntake your first pictures of the School Book Depository Building itself\r\nwhen you say you saw a rifle being withdrawn?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, uh--as best I can recall, the excitement on the ground\r\nof people running and policemen \"revving\" up their motorcycles--and\r\nI have a real nice shot of a policeman running toward me with his\r\npistol drawn--the activity on the ground kept my attention. The reason\r\nI did not stay and take pictures of the Depository Building--which I\r\nhad originally intended to do when I got out of the motorcade--was\r\nthat--uh--another cameraman from our station, A. J. L'Hoste--[spelling]\r\nL-'-H-o-s-t-e--he came running up and--uh--when he ran up, why I said,\r\n\"You stay here and get shots of the building and go inside--and I'm\r\ngoing to go back--I'm going to follow the President.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Was he also a moving picture cameraman?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he at the time you made this statement?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--he was standing on that little sidewalk that runs\r\nbetween the--I met him on the little sidewalk between the Book\r\nDepository property and the beginning of the parkway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be the west side of the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right; that's right. It's there that I saw the blood\r\non the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, you say you saw blood on the sidewalk, Mr.\r\nCouch?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. This was the little walkway--steps and walkway that leads\r\nup to the corner, the west corner, the southwest corner of the Book\r\nDepository Building. Another little sidewalk, as I recall, turns west\r\nand forms that little parkway and archway right next to the Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did this appear to be freshly created blood?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes; right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how large was this spot of blood that you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--from 8 to 10 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did people around there say how it happened to get there, or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; no one knew. People were watching it--that is, watching\r\nit carefully and walking around it and pointing to it.\r\n\r\nUh--just as I ran up, policemen ran around the west corner and\r\nran--uh--northward on the side of the building. And my first impression\r\nwas that--uh--that they had chased someone out of the building around\r\nthat corner, or possibly they had wounded someone. All the policemen\r\nhad their pistols pulled. And people were pointing back around those\r\nshrubs around that west corner and--uh--you would think that there was\r\na chase going on in that direction.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reason that I didn't follow was because A. J. had come up,\r\nand my first concern was to get back with the President.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This pool of blood--about how far would it have been north\r\nof the curbline of Elm Street as Elm Street goes to the expressway?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I'd say--uh--well, from Elm Street, you mean, itself?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes. This is from that part of Elm Street that goes into the\r\nexpressway?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I'd say--uh--50 to 60 feet, and about 15 feet or 10 to 15\r\nfeet from the corner of the Texas Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It would have been somewhere along that park area there?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything else you noticed by this pool of blood?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No. There were no objects on the ground. We looked for\r\nsomething. We thought there would be something else, but----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There was nothing?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Huh-uh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, this A. J.----?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. L'Hoste. That's \"L\" apostrophe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes; I have that. I have made a note of the spelling, along\r\nwith the phonetic sound.\r\n\r\nDo you know if he got any pictures of the south side of the School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I don't recall what he got--as I recall--now, I may be\r\nwrong, this is a guess--that he did not take any pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He did not take any?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know of anyone that took any pictures of the south\r\nside of the School Book Depository Building, particularly the front\r\nentrance of the building, shortly after the assassination?\r\n\r\nDr. COUCH. No; only what I have seen in Time magazine.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Only what you've seen in Time magazine?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, did you ever know or hear of Lee Harvey Oswald before\r\nany of this?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you ever met Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There is an FBI report that states that you had heard\r\nhearsay statements that someone had seen Jack Ruby emerge from the rear\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository Building around that time. Did\r\nanyone ever tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes. Uh--where I first heard it, I could not now recall;\r\nbut--uh--the story went that--uh--Wes Wise, who works for KRLD----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. TV?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Yes--saw him moments after the shooting--how many moments,\r\nI don't know--5 minutes, 10 minutes--coming around the side of the\r\nbuilding, coming around the east side going south, I presume.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever talk to Wes Wise as to whether or not he\r\nactually saw this, or is this just hearsay?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I didn't. This is just hearsay.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this: Is there any observation, other than\r\nhearsay, that you have about this entire sequence of events that you\r\nhave not related here?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I can't think of anything. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In this same FBI report of an interview with you, it states\r\nthat--and by the way, I did not show this to you when you first chatted\r\nabout this--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh-huh; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There is a statement as to the time sequence--that you\r\nheard, first, two loud noises about 10 seconds apart. And you related\r\nhere that it would have been 5 seconds apart or less. Do you remember\r\nwhether or not at the time you gave your first statement to the FBI\r\nyou said 10 seconds or would you have said about 10 seconds or would\r\nyou have said less than 10 seconds--or could this be inaccurate, as\r\nsometimes happens?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I don't recall now. Ten seconds is not a reasonable time;\r\neven if I said \"about 10 seconds.\" I know a little bit more about\r\ntiming than that. We have to time our stories pretty close--and that's\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what's your best recollection now as to the amount of\r\ntime between shots?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Well, I would say the longest time would be 5 seconds, but\r\nit could be from 3 to 5.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And would this be true between the first and the second\r\nshots as well as between the second and third--or would there have been\r\na difference?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. As I recall, the time sequence between the three were\r\nrelatively the same.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mr. Couch, shortly before we commenced taking this\r\ndeposition, you and I met for the first time. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then we came to this room and we chatted for a few\r\nminutes before we started taking a formal deposition. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, is there anything that we talked about pertaining\r\nto the assassination that in any way differs or conflicts with the\r\ntestimony that you have just given?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the fact as to whether or not I questioned you in\r\ngreat detail about each question or whether or not I just asked you to\r\nrelate the story to me?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. You asked me to give general highlight impressions before we\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then, after you gave those to me, we started taking the\r\ndeposition--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you repeated on the deposition what we had talked\r\nabout--is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right--in more detail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can think of at this time\r\nwhich, in any way, would affect the investigation of the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No; I cannot think of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we want to thank you very much for taking your time to\r\ncome down here. We know that you're a busy man. We also would like you\r\nto convey our thanks to station WFAA-TV for allowing you to come down\r\nhere. We appreciate it very much.\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Couch, we're going back on the record again. You're\r\nstill under oath--and I'm not quite sure whether I asked this question,\r\nbut I had better ask it again.\r\n\r\nWhen you saw this rifle being withdrawn. About how much of it could you\r\nsee at first?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. I'd say just about a foot of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And in what direction was the barrel pointing at the time\r\nyou saw it being withdrawn?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Approximately a 45° angle westward--which would be pointing\r\ndown Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Down Elm Street as it goes into the expressway there?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And when you say \"45° angle\" would that be up or down, or\r\nare you referring to the angle of incline, or the angle of west and\r\nsouth?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. The angle of incline--from a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. So, you would estimate about a 45° angle downward\r\npointing in what would be a southwesterly direction?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. Uh--westerly direction. From looking straight on at the\r\nbuilding, one could not tell the--uh--angle, whether it was more\r\nsouthward or not. In other words, something sticking out the building,\r\nI couldn't tell. It was not--it did not appear to me that it was\r\nsticking straight out the window, so to speak.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes. Is there anything else that you noticed about the gun?\r\n\r\nMr. COUCH. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I got that\r\non the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF TOM C. DILLARD\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Tom C. Dillard was taken at 9:15 a.m., on April 1,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. State your name.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Tom C. Dillard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you stand and raise your right hand, please?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD (Complying).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony given before this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. My name is Joseph A. Ball. I am staff counsel for the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. You\r\nhave already been requested to be present have you not----\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. By letter; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By letter which you received last week?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I am a photographer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I might state the purpose of questioning you is to ask you\r\nquestions as to any knowledge you might have as to the facts concerning\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, at Dallas,\r\nTex.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I understand. My occupation is journalist; I am chief\r\nphotographer of the Dallas Morning News, do some aviation writing but\r\nmy primary job is head of the photographic department and, of course, I\r\ndo outside work for the paper on photographic work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I'm 49.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What has been your general education?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. High school, very few college courses.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. High school and very few college courses.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I didn't go to school. I graduated Fort Worth, from the\r\nold Central High School, went to the Officer Candidate School in the\r\nMilitary and Air University.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been with the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. The Dallas News since 1947 and I was with the Star\r\nTelegram, went to work in 1929.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you been a photographer for the papers all these years?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, yes; of course, the first years, when I was started\r\nat the age of 15, I was a copy boy and did various reporting and\r\nwhatever we could do on the paper. I was 15 when I started.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, you were in the motorcade who followed\r\nPresident Kennedy, weren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That is correct. I understand our car was about number six\r\nin the line.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you meet the President at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then you rode in the motorcade from Love Field into\r\nDallas?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was in your car?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I remember Jim Underwood, he's an announcer for KRLD-TV\r\nand cameraman, acting as a cameraman that day; and Bob Jackson of the\r\nTimes-Herald, cameraman; and Couch with our TV station, Channel 8, and\r\ndid you have information his name is Couch?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's right; and the man that drove----\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Channel 5--Darnell, I think his name is, and the driver of\r\nthe car which I don't believe I remember his name. It was a Chevrolet\r\nconvertible.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your car was about sixth, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. From the President's car. We lost our position out at the\r\nairport. I understood we were supposed to have been quite a bit closer.\r\nWe were assigned as the prime photographic car which, as you probably\r\nknow, normally a truck precedes the President on these things and\r\ncertain representatives of the photographic press ride with the truck.\r\nIn this case, as you know, we didn't have any and this car that I was\r\nin was to take any photographs which was of spot-news nature.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As you turned from Main Street onto Houston, was the\r\nPresident's car in sight at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. No; and the whole parade, the whole trip to town, I could\r\nonly distinguish the President's car on very few occasions in high\r\nrises in the ground, when we got on hills. It was difficult because the\r\npeople in the cars ahead of me were sitting on the backs of cars which\r\npretty well covered the President's car for me. We had a very, very\r\npoor view of the President's car at any time from the time the parade\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me whether or not the President's car had made\r\nthe turn off Houston Street when your car turned north on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. It had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It had?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. No; I won't say it had. I think it had because, like I\r\nsay, I could never see the car very well. I believe it had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you sitting in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I was sitting in the right front.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was in the front seat with you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Oh, I don't remember; I think Jackson was sitting beside\r\nme--no; I believe Jackson was sitting in the back. I don't remember\r\nwhat our locations were.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you know you were in the right front?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear something unusual as you were driving north on\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes; I heard an explosion which I made the comment that\r\nI believe, in my memory, I believe I said, \"My God, they've thrown a\r\ntorpedo\" and why I said \"torpedo\", I don't know. If you wish, I'll go\r\nahead----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Go ahead with your story.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, then I later estimated, immediately later,\r\nestimated, oh, 4, about 3 or 4 seconds, another explosion and my\r\ncomment was, \"No, It's heavy rifle fire,\" and I remember very\r\ndistinctly I said, \"It's very heavy rifle fire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many explosions did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I heard three--the three approximately equally spaced.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the best estimate of the position of your car with\r\nreference to the turn at Main and Houston when you heard the first\r\nexplosion?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Perhaps, oh, just a few feet around the corner and it\r\nseems we had slowed a great deal. It seems that our car had slowed down\r\nso that we were moving rather slowly and perhaps just passed the turn\r\nwhen I heard the first explosion.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anyone in your car say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, after the third shot I know my comment was, \"They\r\nkilled him.\" I don't know why I said that but Jackson--there was some\r\nrunning comment about what can we do or where is it coming from and\r\nwe were all looking. We had an absolutely perfect view of the School\r\nDepository from our position in the open car, and Bob Jackson said,\r\n\"There's a rifle barrel up there.\" I said, \"Where?\" I had my camera\r\nready. He said, \"It's in that open window.\" Of course, there were\r\nseveral open windows and I scanned the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which building?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. The School Depository. And at the same time I brought my\r\ncamera up and I was looking for the window. Now, this was after the\r\nthird shot and Jackson said, \"There's the rifle barrel up there,\" and\r\nthen he said it was the second from the top in the right-hand side, and\r\nI swung to it and there was two figures below, and I just shot with\r\none camera, 100-mm. lens on a 35-mm. camera which is approximately a\r\ntwo times daily photo twice normal lens and a wide angle on a 35-mm.\r\nwhich took in a considerable portion of the building and I shot those\r\npictures in rapid sequence with the two cameras.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You shot how many pictures?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Two pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With one camera or two different cameras?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Two different cameras--one daily photo, not extreme daily\r\nphoto, but twice the normal lens.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say your cameras were ready? How were they ready?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Hung around my neck and held in my hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You brought them up and focused and shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, on the whole ride, I had been watching the tops of\r\nbuildings and watching for any signs or anything unusual which, of\r\ncourse, is a newsman's chore on a parade like that. We were badly--in a\r\nvery bad position from our viewpoint to cover anything on the parade,\r\nso we were all, as any news photographer is, rather tense when he is\r\ncovering a Presidential or an affair of that sort and he is trying to\r\nget whatever pictures possible and watching for every possibility, and\r\nso we all tried for a number of things. Incidentally, the only unusual\r\nthing in the parade that I noticed was the President--I understand the\r\nPresident stopped his car at Lemmon and Loma Alta, which is out in the\r\nnear suburbs of Dallas, as I understand, at the request of a sign that\r\nsaid, \"Mr. President, stop and shake hands with us.\" I jumped out of\r\nthe car--it was a convertible with the top down--and tried to run to\r\nget pictures of it but by that time the parade started and I was unable\r\nto get up that far.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you shot these two pictures of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, how far were you from the building, would you say?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. From the window or from the----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the building. That would be, I suppose, a measurement\r\nalong the street.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I would say it was just before we reached the corner of\r\nElm and Houston Streets.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were south of Elm and Houston, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About how far? Well, perhaps as a photographer, you can give\r\nme a more accurate estimate this way; tell me how far you think your\r\ncamera was from the upper windows when you shot that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Oh, it wasn't over 50, 60 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything in the windows?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't see a rifle barrel?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did see some figures or forms in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Only in the windows which was the windows below.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many forms did you see in the windows below?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I saw two men in the windows, at least the arched windows.\r\nI saw them in my picture. I was making the picture my eyes were\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw them as you were taking the picture?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I may have; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember if you saw two or three figures?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did see some figures and you cannot be accurate?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your car stopped where?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I remember, we were stopping and starting down Houston\r\nStreet or moving very slowly while this shooting was going on, and I\r\nknow we came around the corner of Houston and Elm and saw people lying\r\non the ground down the hill on the sides of the lawns there in the\r\nplaza, and I jumped out of my car. The car stopped then and I got out\r\nand I don't know what happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you go out?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, I made a picture of cars moving into the sun under\r\nthe underpass, somebody chasing the car and I looked at the situation\r\nin that area and saw absolutely nothing of the Presidential car or\r\nanything that appeared worth photographing to me at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you stay around there?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Perhaps 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Another car, Chevrolet convertible, of the party came by\r\nwith, I assume, dignitaries in it and I jumped on the back of it and we\r\nstarted--I told them, of course, who I was and we started out Stemmons\r\nExpressway toward the Trade Mart and I explained to them what I knew\r\nand tried to hold onto the back of that car at rather high speed. I\r\nnever saw the Presidential car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have any idea or any impression as to the source of\r\nthe explosions--what direction it was coming from?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, I felt that, at the time, I felt like it was coming\r\nfrom a north area and quite close, and I might qualify I have had a\r\ngreat deal of experience. I am a gun nut and have a great number of\r\nhigh-powered rifles at home, so I know a little bit about guns.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have had experience with rifles?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, I have shot a great deal, so I am familiar with\r\nthe noise that they made in that area. We were getting a sort of\r\nreverberation which made it difficult to pinpoint the actual direction\r\nbut my feeling was that it was coming into my face and, in that I was\r\nfacing north toward the School Depository--I might add that I very\r\ndefinitely smelled gun powder when the car moved up at the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I very definitely smelled it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By that you mean when you moved up to the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes; now, there developed a very brisk north wind.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was in front of the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, it's rather close--the corner is rather close. I\r\nmentioned it, I believe, that it was rather surprising to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who did you mention it to?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Bob, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Bob Jackson?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yeah, Bob and I were talking about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You developed your pictures, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or did you turn them over?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I printed them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You printed them?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, I don't remember whether I developed that roll or\r\nnot. I may have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you do that the same day?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, immediately thereafter, shortly after I came back\r\nfrom the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you examined the pictures that you had taken--those two\r\npictures you had taken?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have----\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. There was never any question in my mind that there was\r\nmore than or less than three explosions which were all heavy rifle\r\nfire, in my opinion, of the same rifle. The same rifle fired three\r\nshots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you still have the two negatives?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes; of these [indicating]?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have them in your possession?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. At the Dallas News; they're in a box kept locked in the\r\nmanaging editor's office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Suppose we could do this. I have pictures here which you can\r\nidentify but perhaps it might be a little closer to the source if we do\r\nthis. Could you make me up two prints for your deposition from those\r\nnegatives?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Well, I guess so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Off-record discussion.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You will endorse your signature on each copy as being a print\r\nmade from your negatives, is that satisfactory?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Suits me; I could get it notarized.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't need to do that because we can attach it as a copy\r\nto this deposition.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I could sign these; of course, you want that other.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We have two here. First of all, you made one picture with a\r\nwide lens?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you made a picture with a short lens?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Long lens--short and wide are the same.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A short, wide lens and one long lens. Now, I show you two\r\npictures and I mark one \"A\" and mark one \"B.\" Look them over and tell\r\nme whether or not those are prints from the picture that you made that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. These are prints from one of the negatives I made on\r\nNovember 22.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then you will furnish us two prints, one from each\r\nnegative which we will mark as \"C\" and \"D\" and you will initial them,\r\nis that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you mind initialing the \"A\" and \"B\" and we will make it\r\npart of this deposition--just on the back?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. One of them will be the same picture as these two. These\r\ntwo are prints from one of my negatives.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That will be all right.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I have another negative.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which you will make a print of?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. If you wish.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Make up a print from each negative. Now, you made a statement\r\nto Agent Keutzer of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the 25th of\r\nNovember 1963, didn't you, or thereabouts?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And at that time, you told him that you first heard a noise\r\nwhich sounded like a torpedo, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes, I said----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Off-record discussion.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell him that hearing another sound similar to that,\r\nyou realized it was gunfire?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you heard the third shot. Now, the statement says that\r\nupon hearing the third shot, the car in which he was riding was stopped\r\nalmost in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. My car?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear Bob Jackson of the Dallas Times-Herald exclaim\r\n\"I see a rifle; it's up in the open window\".\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Jackson pointed to the Texas School Book Depository\r\nlocated at Elm and Houston Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you looked up at the building and you did not see a rifle\r\nprotruding from any window?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. I did not see a rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did take two photographs?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you still have those negatives?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That's true.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you ever in a position where you could see anyone leave\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Briefly, only in the very short time, perhaps a period of\r\n3 or 4 minutes, that I was in the general area. After the third shot, I\r\nwas probably not there over 3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody leave the building?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. To my knowledge; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's everything. Will you waive signature on this?\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. Sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. DILLARD. That's all right, glad to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES ROBERT UNDERWOOD\r\n\r\nThe testimony of James Robert Underwood was taken at 11:25 a.m., on\r\nApril 1, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office\r\nBuilding, Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Underwood, will you stand up and be sworn?\r\n\r\n(Complying.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give\r\nbefore this Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. My name is James Robert Underwood.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I am the assistant news director of KRLD-TV and radio in\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, you were in the motorcade, the\r\nPresidential motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes, sir; I was three cars behind the President.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was in the car with you?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. There was a photographer from channel 5, WBAP-TV, whose\r\nname is James Darnell, and a photographer from the Dallas Morning\r\nNews--I know his name but I can't think of it right now----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tom Dillard?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; Tom Dillard, and a photographer from the Dallas\r\nTimes-Herald whose name is Bob Jackson, also a photographer from\r\nWFAA-TV and I do not know his name. I heard it but I don't remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There was a driver, also?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; the driver I later found out was a member of the\r\ndepartment of public safety.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are a photographer, also?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes, sir; I wear many hats in my business but one of\r\nwhich is news photographer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have your camera with you that day?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes, sir; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your experience; where were you born; where did you\r\ngo to school; how did you get to get the experience that fit you for\r\nyour present job? Just in your own words, tell me something about\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I was born in Oklahoma City, Okla., in 1922; I served in\r\nthe Marine Corps from 1940 until 1943, almost 4 years, and after that\r\nI attended the University of Tulsa and after that I worked--I began\r\nworking in radio as an announcer while I was going to college. When I\r\ngot out of college, I went to Corpus Christi, Tex. That was about 1947\r\nand I became program director and news director of a radio station in\r\nCorpus Christi and I stayed there until 1950 when I went to a station\r\nin Jacksonville, Fla., where I was also program director and news\r\ndirector, and in 1953, I came to Dallas, and I worked for a year and\r\na half for WFAA-TV as an announcer, then I freelanced in television\r\nand radio from September of 1954 until November--and I have to count\r\nfor a minute--6 years this November that would be until November 1958\r\nwhen I went to work for KRLD-TV and Radio News and shortly thereafter\r\nI became assistant news director but I earned part of my living, I\r\nstill freelance in television which is all freelance in television and\r\nI have a regular job which entails every type of reporting, including\r\nphotography which I enjoy doing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the day of the assassination, you were in the motorcade\r\nwith these men you mentioned and you think your car was third behind\r\nthe Presidential car?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; and I thought it was six or seven. I shot sound\r\non film of the President's arrival and Vice President's arrival at\r\nDallas Love Field the morning he came in on the 22d and then I took off\r\nthe rather cumbersome sound on film equipment and took my hand camera\r\nbecause I had an assigned place in the motorcade and I could not tell\r\nout there because of the many people I could not tell what position\r\nwe were in. I could not see that far ahead to determine exactly where\r\nwe were in the motorcade, although I knew we were in the front of it.\r\nThe motorcade stopped once on the way downtown, this was briefly, and\r\nI jumped over this side--we were in a convertible--and ran toward\r\nthe President's car and I was aware of the crowd and the motorcade\r\nimmediately started and I ran back to the convertible, not wanting\r\nto be left, and looking afterward at the films that I took there,\r\nI could then count the cars there. I realized we were three behind\r\nhim, according to my movies we took. When we turned onto Main Street\r\ndowntown and headed west toward the scene of where the assassination\r\ntook place, either the regulator or the mainspring in my camera broke\r\nand I was without a camera. I knew that we had two men, at least two\r\nmen on the parade route who were on the street and would be filming\r\nthe motorcade as we came by and I hoped to exchange my broken camera\r\nfor one of theirs because I knew I could make more use of the one that\r\nwould operate. The only problem was we went down Main Street so rapidly\r\nit would have been impossible to get anything from someone standing on\r\nthe street and at Main and Record one of our men was stationed and I\r\ntried to holler at him my camera was broken and I wanted to switch and\r\nI started to and there was no point in it because we passed there that\r\nrapidly. I thought it was the fastest motorcade that passed through a\r\ncrowd; this was really moving, as far as I was concerned. Then, we came\r\nto the scene where the shots were fired. Do you want me to go on?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the time you turned, tell me what you observed after you\r\nmade the turn at Main and Houston to drive north on Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. After we turned onto Houston Street, the car I was in\r\nwas about, as far as I can remember, about in the middle of the block\r\nor a little bit north of the center of the block, which is a short\r\nblock, when I heard the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Between Main and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; between Main and Elm, closer to the Elm\r\nintersection, Elm and Houston intersection, when I heard the first shot\r\nfired. I thought it was an explosion. I have heard many rifles fired\r\nbut it did not sound like a rifle to me. Evidently must have been a\r\nreverberation from the buildings or something. I believe I said to one\r\nof the other fellows it sounds like a giant firecracker and the car I\r\nwas in was about in the intersection of Elm and Houston when I heard a\r\nsecond shot fired and moments later a third shot fired and I realized\r\nthat they were by that time, the last two shots, I realized they were\r\ncoming from overhead.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You realized they were coming from overhead and that would be\r\nfrom what source?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. That would be from the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It sounded like they were coming from that direction?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes, sir; the last two. Now, the first was just a\r\nloud explosion but it sounded like a giant firecracker or something\r\nhad gone off. By the time the third shot was fired, the car I was in\r\nstopped almost through the intersection in front of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building and I leaped out of the car before the car\r\nstopped. Bob Jackson from the Herald said he thought he saw a rifle in\r\nthe window and I looked where he pointed and I saw nothing. Below the\r\nwindow he was pointing at, I saw two colored men leaning out there with\r\ntheir heads turned toward the top of the building, trying, I suppose,\r\nto determine where the shots were coming from.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What words did you hear Bob Jackson say?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I don't know that I can remember exactly except I did\r\nhear him say words to the effect that \"I saw a rifle\" and I looked at\r\nthat instant and I saw nothing myself. If he saw a rifle, I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that point when you looked, where was your car?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Our car was in the intersection, in the intersection of\r\nElm and Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had it made the turn yet?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. It had partially made the turn or had just begun to make\r\nthe turn. Frankly, I was looking up and around and I saw at the same\r\ntime people falling on the ground down the street toward the underpass\r\nand my first impression was some of these people falling to the ground\r\nhad been shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did your car stop?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Our car stopped and the minute it stopped I leaped out\r\nof the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was your car when it stopped?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Right in the intersection, perhaps just past the\r\nintersection, turned onto Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you get out before the car parked along the curb?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes, sir; the minute it stopped, I leaped over the side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I left my camera in the car, the camera that was broken,\r\nand ran as fast as I could back toward the man we had at Record and\r\nMain in order to get a camera. There I was without a camera; the only\r\nthought I had was to get a camera.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you get one?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; I ran the full block back to Main Street and our\r\nman there, name of Sanderson, was running down Main toward Houston. He\r\nwas running to meet me, although he didn't know what was happening and\r\nthat my camera was broke. Suddenly, motorcycles and sirens had been\r\nturned on police cars and were all headed toward Main. I met him just\r\naround the corner on Main past Houston and grabbed his camera and said,\r\n\"Someone had been shooting at the President.\" I didn't know this but I\r\nassumed it happened. I took his camera and got back to the scene. When\r\nI got back to the scene, most of the people in the area were running\r\nup the grassy slope toward the railway yards just behind the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building. Actually, I assumed, which is the only\r\nthing I could do, I assumed perhaps who had fired the shots had run in\r\nthat direction. I recognized at least a dozen deputy sheriffs running\r\nalso in that area--it seems to me that many, and I ran up there and\r\ntook some films and they were running through the railroad yard and\r\nthey very quickly found nothing and I was having, frankly, a hard time\r\nbreathing because I had done more running in those few minutes than I\r\nam used to doing. I gasped out to a couple people--I don't know who\r\nthey are--that I thought the shots came from that building and one of\r\nthe fellows in the car with me said they had seen a rifle barrel in the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This group of men were deputy sheriffs?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. For the most part, yes; I don't think I could\r\nrecall--Lemmy Lewis I see in my mind, but I am not sure Lemmy was\r\nthere. This was a kaleidoscope of things happening. In my business, you\r\nneed to make a quick appraisal of what is happening if you are going to\r\nshoot pictures of it. I was confused and out of breath and unbelieving\r\nof what happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go from the grassy slopes?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I went from the railroad yards--actually, I was back in\r\nthe track area--I went immediately with these men at a run to the Texas\r\nSchool Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. The front entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; and I ran down there and I think I took some\r\npictures of some men--yes, I know I did, going in and out of the\r\nbuilding. By that time there was one police officer there and he was a\r\nthree-wheeled motorcycle officer and a little colored boy whose last\r\nname I remember as Eunice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Euins?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. It may have been Euins. It was difficult to understand\r\nwhen he said his name. He was telling the motorcycle officer he had\r\nseen a colored man lean out of the window upstairs and he had a rifle.\r\nHe was telling this to the officer and the officer took him over\r\nand put him in a squad car. By that time, motorcycle officers were\r\narriving, homicide officers were arriving and I went over and asked\r\nthis boy if he had seen someone with a rifle and he said \"Yes, sir.\"\r\nI said, \"Were they white or black?\" He said, \"It was a colored man.\"\r\nI said, \"Are you sure it was a colored man?\" He said, \"Yes sir\" and I\r\nasked him his name and the only thing I could understand was what I\r\nthought his name was Eunice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he about 15?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I couldn't tell his age; looked to me to be younger. I\r\nwould have expected him to be about 10 or 11 years old.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I stayed in front of the building; actually, I stayed in\r\nthe intersection of Elm and Houston and took movies of police arriving\r\nand fire--and I think some fire equipment arrived on the scene, one\r\nfiretruck or two firetrucks, I'm not sure, and I just shot some general\r\nfilm on the area. I have since searched that film to see if I could see\r\nany face in it that would have been important to this.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Leaving the building?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. Yes; but I haven't found any except that of officers\r\narriving and just people generally in the area; none of it, though,\r\nthat you could--I spent several days at this, I guess during January\r\nwhen things had calmed down. I was on the side street of the building,\r\naround the front of the building and in the intersection for the next\r\n10 minutes, then I went across the street to the courthouse and phoned\r\nseveral news reports to C.B.S. in New York and described what was\r\ntaking place in the building at that time. There were firemen with\r\nladders in front of the building and officers running in and out and\r\nthey cordoned off the building and kept the spectators out of the\r\nbuilding, but there was quite a time lapse between the time the shots\r\nwere fired and the time anyone checked the building. The main effort\r\nwas to run to the railroad yards instead of the School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all. Mr. Underwood, this will be typed up and\r\nyou can waive signature if you wish or you can sign it if you wish.\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. I don't have to sign it. I will waive signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES N. CRAWFORD\r\n\r\nThe testimony of James N. Crawford was taken at 11:15 a.m., on April\r\n1, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Crawford, I'm Joe Ball and this is Lillian Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Glad to know you. I know Lillian Johnson. How is Irving,\r\nby the way?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you stand up, please, and hold up your right hand?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD (complying).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before this\r\nCommission shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I swear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. My name is Joe Ball. I'm staff counsel with the President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy and I have been\r\nauthorized to question you and ask you to give us such information as\r\nyou have as to the facts of the assassination and those things that you\r\nobserved on November 22, 1963. Will you state your name for the court\r\nreporter?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. My name is James N. Crawford.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I am deputy district clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You received a request from the Commission in writing, did\r\nyou not, requesting you to give this testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You received it some time last week?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Actually, it came to the office Saturday. I did not\r\nreceive it until Monday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That will be Monday, March 30?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you born?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I was born in Greenville, Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was your general education?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. High school in Greenville, Texas, and college at Texas A.\r\n& M.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that, just a general sketch of some of\r\nyour occupations?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I worked for the Texas Company in New Orleans and have\r\nbeen in and out of the furniture business and in the oil business here\r\nin Dallas until I went with the county.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been with the county of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. About 10 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are a deputy county clerk there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. District clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, about around 12 o'clock or so, where\r\nwere you?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I was in the office of the district clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you later leave and go out into the street?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. About 12:25, we left the office and went out to the\r\ncorner of Houston and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went with whom?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Mary Ann Mitchell.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She works in the office with you?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. She is in the office with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is her occupation in the office?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Assistant to the district clerk.\r\n\r\n(At this point, Mr. James Underwood enters the hearing.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is your office located in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. It's located on the ground floor of the Records Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What street?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. That's Record and Elm--that's Commerce, isn't it, Jim?\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. What's that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. What is the street just north of the courthouse--that's\r\nElm.\r\n\r\nMr. UNDERWOOD. It's bordered by Elm, Main, Record, and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are located on the corner of----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Elm and----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. And Record.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Record, and then you walked which direction?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Well, actually, the courthouse is--I suppose our office\r\nwould be considered on Elm and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you left your office, you walked on what street?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Walked on Elm to Houston, rather than Record.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, you walked west on Elm towards Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To what corner of Elm and Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. That would be the corner of the courthouse. Do you want\r\nthe direction of the intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, where was it? Southeast, northwest corner of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. It's the northwest corner of the courthouse.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The northwest corner of the courthouse--it's the southeast\r\ncorner of the intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Southeast corner of the intersection.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you watched the President pass?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I was at that location.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which corner of the intersection?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. The southeast corner of the intersection.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was the Texas School Book Depository Building from\r\nwhere you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. It would be on the northwest corner of the intersection.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Directly across?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes; right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have a good view at that point of the south exposure\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I had a very good angle.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car pass?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And just tell me in your own words what you observed after\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. As I observed the parade, I believe there was a car\r\nleading the President's car, followed by the President's car and\r\nfollowed, I suppose, by the Vice President's car and, in turn, by the\r\nSecret Service in a yellow closed sedan. The doors of the sedan were\r\nopen. It was after the Secret Service sedan had gone around the corner\r\nthat I heard the first report and at that time I thought it was a\r\nbackfire of a car but, in analyzing the situation, it could not have\r\nbeen a backfire of a car because it would have had to have been the\r\nPresident's car or some car in the cavalcade there. The second shot\r\nfollowed some seconds, a little time elapsed after the first one, and\r\nfollowed very quickly by the third one. I could not see the President's\r\ncar----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. That's right; I couldn't even see the Secret Service\r\ncar, at least I wasn't looking for it. As the report from the third\r\nshot sounded, I looked up. I had previously looked around to see if\r\nthere was somebody shooting firecrackers to see if I could see a puff\r\nof smoke, and after I decided it wasn't a backfire from an automobile\r\nand as the third report was sounded, I looked up and from the far east\r\ncorner of the sixth floor I saw a movement in the only window that was\r\nopen on that floor. It was an indistinct movement. It was just barely a\r\nglimpse.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. That would be the far east window----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. On the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. I\r\nturned to Miss Mitchell and made the statement that if those were shots\r\nthey came from that window. That was based mainly on the fact of the\r\nquick movement observed in the window right at the conclusion of the\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you give me any better description than just a\r\nmovement? Could you use any other words to describe what you saw by way\r\nof color or size of what you saw moving?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. If I were asked to describe it, I would say that it was a\r\nprofile, somewhat from the waist up, but it was a very quick movement\r\nand rather indistinct and it was very light colored. It was either\r\nlight colored or it was reflection from the sun. When the gun was\r\nfound, or when a gun was found, I asked the question if it was white,\r\nsimply because if it was a gun I saw, then it was either white or it\r\nwas reflecting the sun so it would appear white or light colored.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any boxes in that window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes, directly behind the window, oh possibly three feet\r\nor less, there were boxes stacked up behind the window and I believe\r\nit was the only place in the building that I observed where boxes were\r\nstacked just like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any boxes in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. No, I didn't see any. There wasn't any boxes in the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay there at that point very long, the southeast\r\ncorner?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. No; as I said. I couldn't observe the President's car and\r\nI had no actual knowledge that he had been shot, so realizing that we\r\nshould get the information almost immediately from the radio which had\r\nbeen covering the motorcade--we had been listening to it prior to going\r\non the street--I thought our best information would come from that,\r\nso we went, Miss Mitchell and I, went back into the office. I have no\r\nway of knowing the time. I would say it was a minute or--I would say a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After you heard the shots, did you return to the office?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The movement that you saw that you describe as something\r\nlight and perhaps a profile from the waist up, you mean it looked like\r\na profile of a person?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. That was--I had a hard time describing that. When I saw\r\nit, I automatically in my mind came to the conclusion that it was a\r\nperson having moved out of the window. Now, to say that it was a brown\r\nhaired, light skinned individual, I could not do that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you tell whether it was a man or woman?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I could not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You made a report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on\r\nthe 10th of January?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Before I ask you about your report, did you have any\r\nimpression as to the source of the sound, from what direction the sound\r\ncame, the sound of the explosions?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes; I do. As I mentioned before, the sound, I thought\r\nit was a backfire in the cavalcade from down the hill, down the hill\r\ntoward the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean west on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes, and that was a little confusing and in analyzing it\r\nlater, evidently the report that I heard, and probably a lot of other\r\npeople, the officers or the FBI, it evidently was a sound that was\r\nreflected by the underpass and therefore came back. It did not sound to\r\nme, ever, as I remember, the high-powered rifle sounding. It was not\r\nthe sharp crack.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What caused you to look up at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. The sound had to be coming from somewhere; the noise was\r\nbeing made at some place, so I didn't see anyone shooting firecrackers\r\nor anything else and I thought \"this idiot surely shouldn't do such\r\na thing,\" but if they were, where were they, and if they were shots,\r\nwhere were they coming from, and that caused me to search the whole\r\narea on Houston Street and in front of the Texas Depository on Elm\r\nStreet and then up and that's how I happened to be looking up at the\r\ntime, rather than observing things in the street, probably.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see any smoke?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In your remark to Mary Ann Mitchell, did you say \"if those\r\nwere shots, they came from that window\"?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is what you reported to the FBI agent, also?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes, I suppose; at that time, I was still not absolutely\r\nsure that they were shots and that's why I said if they were shots. I\r\nwas basing that, I am sure I was basing that mainly on the fact of this\r\nquick movement that I observed. In other words, if I were firing the\r\nshots, I would have jumped back immediately at the conclusion of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Later on, did you go back in the street and talk to someone?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to a deputy sheriff?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Allen Swett.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you tell him?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I told him to have the men search the boxes directly\r\nbehind this window that was open on the sixth floor--the window in the\r\nfar east corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell him anything of what you had seen?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I don't think so. I think I was so amazed that I could\r\nwalk across the street and walk up to this building that was supposedly\r\nunder surveillance and the man had not been--I say \"the man\"--there had\r\nnot been anyone apprehended.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long was it after you heard the shots that you walked up\r\nto Allen Swett and talked to him?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. My guess is it could have been anywhere from 10-20\r\nminutes. My guess would be around 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In the statement you made to the FBI agent, he reports you\r\nsaid you walked to the Texas School Book Depository where you contacted\r\nDeputy Sheriff Allen Swett and advised him of the movement you had seen\r\nin the sixth floor window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I must have said something about the movement. I did tell\r\nhim to search those windows, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you in your own words give us your memory of what you\r\ntold Allen Swett?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I would probably have said, as I remember it, that to\r\nhave the men search--have someone search the boxes directly behind that\r\nwindow. I had seen some movement directly after the shots. That was,\r\nI think, all I said. I did not--there was no conversation and at the\r\nconclusion of my statement, he directed several men up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever go in the building yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. I did not and I still have not been in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all, Mr. Crawford. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Thank you, Mr. Ball.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Incidentally, will you waive signature on this?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD. Yes; I will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARY ANN MITCHELL\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mary Ann Mitchell was taken at 2:30 p.m., on April 1,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Miss Mitchell, will you stand up, please, and be sworn; hold\r\nup your right hand.\r\n\r\n(Complying.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will be giving before\r\nthis Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Mary Ann Mitchell.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I am a deputy district clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For Dallas County?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. For the county of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work is that; do you work in the court?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. No; I work in the main office of the clerk of the\r\ndistrict courts.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me something about your background--where were you born,\r\nwhere were you raised, what schools did you go to?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I was born in Roanoke, Tex., which is in Denton County,\r\nabout 30 miles north of here; graduated from high school in Denton in\r\n1942. I went to college for 2 years at Arlington and moved to Dallas\r\nand came to work here in June of 1944. I have held several secretarial\r\nand stenographic type jobs before I went to work for the county of\r\nDallas and that was in 1950 and I have been there since then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Since 1950, you have been with the county with the Clerk of\r\nthe District Court of Dallas County?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November 1963, about noontime, where were you?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. About noontime?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I was in the office about noon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Working?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Working, which is in the basement of the Records\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you leave there some time, leave the office to see the\r\nparade that morning?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes, as a matter of fact, I went up to see the parade\r\nsince we are in the basement.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you leave the building?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. At possibly 12:25 or 12:27, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whom were you with?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I left the office with Jim Crawford.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I went out onto the street and down to the corner of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That means you would be on what corner of what streets?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I went out the Elm Street entrance of the building and I\r\nwas on the corner of Elm and Record--I'm sorry, Elm and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which corner?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I knew you were going to ask that and I decided it's\r\nprobably the northwest corner. I am not good at directions.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's put it this way----\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. It's the corner diagonally across the intersection from\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The Texas School Book Depository is on the northwest corner;\r\nthat would put you on the southeast corner.\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes, sir; I was thinking about which corner of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The northwest corner of the building and the southeast corner\r\nof the intersection, is that right?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you near the curb when you were standing?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; I was on the curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car pass?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me in your own words what you noticed and what you heard\r\nafter the President's car passed; what did you see and what did you\r\nhear?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Well, the President's car passed and, of course, I\r\nwatched it as long as I could see it but, as I remember, immediately\r\nbehind it was a car full of men with the top down and quite a few of\r\nthem were standing and I assumed they were Secret Service men, so after\r\nthe car turned the corner and started down the hill, I couldn't see\r\nover the heads of the standing men for very long, so then I turned\r\nback to watch the other people in the caravan, whatever you call it,\r\nand probably about the time the car in which Senator Yarborough was\r\nriding had just passed, I heard some reports. The first one--there\r\nwere three--the second and third being closer together than the first\r\nand second and probably on the first one my thought was that it was a\r\nfirecracker and I think on the second one I thought that some police\r\nofficer was after somebody that wasn't doing right and by the third\r\nreport Jim Crawford had said the shots came from the building and as\r\nI looked up there then we realized that if the shots were coming from\r\nthat building there was bound to have been somebody shooting at the\r\npeople in the cars.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard Jim Crawford say something about if they were\r\nshots--what were his words exactly?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Well, I'm not sure that he said--I think he just said,\r\n\"Those shots came from that building,\" just assuming that everybody\r\ncould have figured out by then that they were shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you look at the building?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody in any of the windows?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I don't remember. I understand there were some porters\r\nthat were leaning out of the fifth floor windows but I don't remember\r\nwhether I saw them or not. I know where I thought he was pointing and\r\nwhere I was looking I couldn't see anybody so I never was sure which\r\nwindow he thought he was pointing to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he pointing?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I am almost sure that he was because I was trying to\r\nfigure out exactly where he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that, if anything?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Well, looked back around at the crowd, I'm sure, because\r\nI expected to see the Secret Service men and police escorts just start\r\npouring everywhere when we decided what the shots were and then looking\r\nat the people that were falling on the ground and started milling\r\naround and then I went back in the office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you did not come out again?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. No; I did not come out again.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you, at any time, say anything like \"oh, no, no\" in reply\r\nto what Mr. Crawford said?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Well, yes, I'm sure I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In reply to what remark of his?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Oh, I don't know. I don't know possibly it was when\r\nhe was talking about the shots coming from the building but I don't\r\nremember if he said anything else.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, if you excuse me just a minute, let me look in my notes\r\nhere. These are the notes from which I refresh my memory here.\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. I can remember what I was saying and doing better than I\r\ncan what other people were.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there anything else that you remember that you said?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Besides when I said something about \"oh, no, no\" or \"oh,\r\nmy goodness\" or \"oh, my God\" or whatever I said?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; that's right.\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; I said, \"This is no place for us, let's get out of\r\nhere.\" I thought if we would get out of their way, the police officers\r\ncould work better.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's when you left?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. That's when I left and he came with me. I had locked the\r\noffice and I had the key to the office still in my hand so I could get\r\nback in very fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all. Do you want to look this over and read it\r\nand sign it or do you want to waive signature?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Either way. We were out of the office such a short\r\ntime because we had spotters in the building so we would know when\r\nthe parade was coming and we could run out. We had so many people in\r\nthe building who worked there upstairs and they called us when it was\r\ncoming so we could go outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. If you wish, we can waive your signature; the young lady will\r\nwrite it up and send it back to Washington, is that all right with you?\r\n\r\nMiss MITCHELL. Yes; that's fine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all. Thank you very much for coming up today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. BARBARA ROWLAND\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mrs. Barbara Rowland was taken at 4 p.m., on April 7,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Rowland, will you stand and be sworn. Do you solemnly\r\nswear that the testimony you are about to give before this President's\r\nCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy is the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you please state your name.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Barbara Rowland.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is it Miss or Mrs.?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Mrs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To whom are you married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Arnold Lewis Rowland.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your husband has already gone to Washington to testify\r\nbefore the Commission in Washington, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your occupation right now? What are you doing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am a housewife.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you a high school graduate?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you still attending high school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; but I plan to go back later.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the fall?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where is your husband working?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He's got a new job. He is working for Life Circulation\r\nCo., or corporation, I don't know which.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What does he do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He is a telephone solicitor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For magazine subscriptions?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is your husband a high school graduate or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you meet while you were going to high school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old is your husband, by the way?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He is 18.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When were you married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We were married May 16, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you will be having your anniversary in another few weeks?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know if I got on the record your residence?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. 1131A Phinney.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you originally from Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You lived here all your life?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Except the summer we lived in Oregon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is your husband originally from Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He is from Corpus Christi.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Has he lived in Texas all of his life, do you know, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No. He has lived in Texas and Kansas and Oregon and\r\nArizona, and I don't know where else.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did he live in Kansas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. About 2 years ago, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know what he was doing when he was in Kansas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He was going to school and working, I don't know what as.\r\nI think he worked in a cafe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know how far your husband got through school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, his credits are all mixed up. I think he lacks one\r\nor two semesters.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Of completing high school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said you were going back to school. Does he plan to keep\r\nworking, or does he plan to go back to school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He plans to go back to school sometime. I'm not sure when.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To finish high school?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. And college. Go to college, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, has he ever made any application for college yet, that\r\nyou know of?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't know for certain.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know, or has he ever said to you that he has?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He told me he was going to make an application at Oregon\r\nState, and--but I don't know if he ever made any applications anywhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you categorize yourself insofar as your grades that\r\nyou got in high school, would they have been C's, B's, or A's, or what?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. A's and a few B's.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was your major?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. English.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If you had one?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I was going to major in English, Math, and Spanish.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All three?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. In high school.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about your husband? Did you know what he was majoring\r\nin?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Math, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know about what his grades were?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Varied.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He made A's and B's in some subjects, and he made C's and\r\nD's, I think, in other subjects.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was this before you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. He says he has an A average, but I don't believe\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why? Did he tell you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. He told me that, because I saw a few of his report\r\ncards.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I saw a few of his report cards and they weren't all A's.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For what years would that have been?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't remember. I just saw them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Rowland, I want to get just a little bit more\r\nbackground information. After you were married, were you employed at\r\nall or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I worked for Sanger Harris during the Christmas season\r\nthis year, this past year.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Other than that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, I worked for about 3 days for a friend of mine at a\r\ndry goods store.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about your husband? What jobs has he held since you\r\nwere married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Let's see, he worked at West Foods in Salem,----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was this after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to Oregon after you were married?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. We were married May 16, and we went to Oregon about,\r\nwe left the next day, and we got there about the 21st or something like\r\nthat. He worked at West Foods in Salem; Exchange Lumber in Salem; Myron\r\nFrank in Salem, and after we moved back down here and----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you move back down to Texas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. In September.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were these jobs that he held of the same type, or did he\r\nwork first at one place and then----\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. One place and then another.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any particular reason why he changed jobs, that you know of?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, the first job was dirty and difficult and he didn't\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was he doing then?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He was working in a mushroom plant.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As what?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I think he was carrying them out, I don't know exactly\r\nwhat he was doing with them. Then he worked at Myron Frank which was a\r\ndepartment store.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did he do there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He worked as a cook.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is he a good cook?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Pretty good cook.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you better than he is?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not a very good cook.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Anyway, he worked there. It was a temporary job when he\r\ngot it, and when the time, when the period was up, he got another job\r\nas a, what do you call it, a shipping clerk at the Exchange Lumber Co.,\r\nand he worked there until a few days before we left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went back to Dallas sometime in September?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did your husband do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't remember the first job. He worked for Pizza\r\nInn as a cook and he worked for Civic Reading Club as a telephone\r\nsolicitation job, and he worked for P. F. Collier Co., as a salesman,\r\nand then he worked, now he is working for Life Circulation Co. as a\r\ntelephone solicitor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did he have these jobs? The first one, how long did\r\nhe work there, approximately?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't know. I think he worked at Pizza Inn for about\r\ntwo and a half months, maybe. And he worked for P. F. Collier for about\r\n4 weeks, I think, but he didn't do anything there. I mean he wasn't\r\nvery successful. And he worked for Civic Reading Club about 2 months, I\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And now he is working for?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Life Circulation Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you working at all during the fall, or what were you\r\ndoing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He worked for Sanger Harris during the Christmas season,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. That is the only job. That is all I have worked.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you going to school at all in the fall, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; at the beginning of the fall we were both going to\r\nschool. But we couldn't quite afford to stay, and so because his job\r\nwas only part-time----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So did either one of you quit or both?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Both.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About when did you both quit?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. In November, I believe it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this have been before or after the shooting of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. Well, we stopped going before the assassination, but we\r\nofficially dropped afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, let me ask you this. On the morning of the\r\nassassination, where were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. We were on Houston Street near the drive-in entrance of\r\nthe records building between Elm and Main Streets.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before that, where had you been that morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. At my mother's home.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had been at your mother's home that morning from about\r\nwhen to when?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, we were living with my mother, and so from that\r\nmorning when we got up, and we walked part way----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you leave your mother's home, about?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I think it was about 10 or 10:30, and we caught the bus.\r\nWe walked a few blocks toward town, because we thought we would be too\r\nlate to come see him, and we caught the bus, I don't know exactly what\r\ntime it was when we got to town, but I think it was about 11:30, and\r\nabout 15 minutes before the motorcade came by is when he told me about\r\nthe man up in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, you caught a bus near your mother's place?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. The Ledbetter bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time do you think you caught the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. I don't know, about 10:30, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did that get you downtown?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. About 11. I don't know exactly. I don't remember times\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, let me ask you this. After you got downtown, what did\r\nyou do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We just stood there waiting for the motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well. I will kind of work backwards. How long did you stand\r\nwaiting for the motorcade before the motorcade came by, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. About 25 minutes, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did it take you to get from the bus stop?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. The bus stop was right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you figure if the motorcade came by at around 12:30, you\r\nfigure you got down to the spot at 12 or 12:05?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If you got down to that spot at 12 or 12:05, how many\r\nminutes prior to that time do you think you got on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. About 45.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You figure it might have been a 45-minute bus ride?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would have meant that you would have got on the bus\r\naround 11:15 or so?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember how long you waited for the bus before you\r\ngot it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We were walking while waiting for the bus, and it was\r\nabout, I guess, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you figured you walked around about 20 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you figured you would have left your mother's home\r\nshortly before 11?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head yes?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, did you notice anything while you were watching,\r\nwaiting for the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We saw an airplane. Now, while we were waiting for the\r\nmotorcade, well, there was a man across the street who fainted in the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were standing now on what street?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. On Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be on the east or the west side of Houston?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. West side--east side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. East side. In front of what building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. In front of the records, at the side of the records\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know any particular spot that you were standing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We were standing near the drive-in entrance. There is an\r\nelevator there, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Near the elevator that comes out of the ground?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you said you noticed a man across the street\r\nfainted. Anything else that you and your husband noticed?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, my husband and I were talking about Mr. Stevenson's\r\nvisit and the way the people had acted, and we were talking about\r\nsecurity measures, and he said he saw a man on the sixth floor of the\r\nSchool Book Depository Building, and when I looked up there I didn't\r\nsee the man, because I didn't know exactly what window he was talking\r\nabout at first.\r\n\r\nAnd when I found out which window it was, the man had apparently\r\nstepped back, because I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which window was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. It was the far left-hand window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you face the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It would be the window to the south side of the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it be on the eastern part of the south side or the\r\nwestern part of the south side?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. West.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it be the farthermost west window?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; the farthermost west pair of windows.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The farthermost west pair of windows. What did your husband\r\nsay to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, we assumed that it was a Secret Service man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But what did he say, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He told me that he saw a man there who looked like he\r\nwas holding a rifle, and that it must be a security man guarding the\r\nmotorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can remember that he told\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when he told you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Nothing. I just generally agreed with him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean \"generally agree\"? Did you see the man?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; I didn't see the man, but I said I guess that was\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you agreed that he must have been a security\r\nofficer?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I notice you are not wearing glasses now. Do you wear\r\nglasses?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. Yes; sometimes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you near-sighted or far-sighted?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. Near-sighted.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have any trouble looking at this window?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. No; I saw the window plainly, and I saw some people\r\nhanging, looking out of some other windows, but he said that the man\r\nwas standing in the background.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say about how far back?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I think he said about 12 feet, I don't know exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say how much of the man he could see?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. Apparently he could see at least from the waist up,\r\nbecause he said that the man was wearing a light shirt, and that he was\r\nholding the rifle at a port arms position.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether the man was white or colored?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. He said he thought he was white.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether the man was an old man or a young man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. He said a young man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether the man was fat or thin?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. He said he was either tall or thin. I mean, if he was\r\ntall, he could have been well built, but if he was not very tall, then\r\nhe was thin.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether or not the man had on a hat?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I don't think he said whether he did or not. But if he\r\nhad seen a hat, I think he would have said so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say what color hair the man had?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how many minutes was this before the motorcade came by\r\nthat he saw this?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. About 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything else about the man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. Not that I remember, except that he was wearing a light\r\ncolored shirt or jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything about any other people in any other\r\nwindows?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, did you notice any other people standing in any other\r\nwindows or leaning out?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I am not sure if I did at that moment.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Later on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I saw some people either earlier or later looking out the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about any of the people you saw?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. Some of them were colored men. I don't think I saw any\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any white men?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember where you saw any of these Negro men?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. On a lower floor, about the fourth floor, I think, and\r\nnearer the center window. The windows nearer the center.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On some floor lower than the sixth floor, which you think\r\nwas the fourth floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. About the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you and your husband comment about these other men?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. We may have said something about there being other people\r\nwatching, I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you particularly watch the sixth floor because of the\r\nfact that you had seen or your husband had seen a person on the sixth\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMrs. BOWLAND. We looked at it for a few minutes, but we didn't look\r\nback, and when we heard the shots, we didn't look back up there. I\r\ngrabbed his hand and started running toward the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this now. From the time that you saw or your\r\nhusband said he saw a man on the southwest part of the sixth floor,\r\nwhich you say was about 15 minutes before the motorcade came by, how\r\nmuch longer did you look back up at the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Just about 2 or 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. About 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean about 2 minutes after that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So that would be up to a time of about 13 minutes before the\r\nmotorcade came by?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever look back at the building after that period of\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I may have glanced at it, but I don't remember looking\r\nback for the purpose of seeing the man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, or any man there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Any man there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were you doing from the 13 minutes on before the\r\nmotorcade came until the time it came?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Just talking and looking.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you looking?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. At the street and the other people, and we talked about\r\nsome men who were carrying cameras.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you were standing watching the motorcade or\r\nstanding watching the street scene, do you remember if your husband was\r\nto your right or to your left? Was he closer towards the School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; he was to my left most of the time, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Just standing there talking.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Talking to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not if he ever looked back at the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I wouldn't know for certain.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever tell you he was looking back at the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever notice him looking back at the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he generally looking at you when he was talking with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not necessarily. He might have been looking around at the\r\nstreet or at the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Or at anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else at that place then that you specifically\r\nremember before the motorcade came by? Did your husband say anything\r\nabout seeing anyone in the building, or did you talk any more about the\r\nman with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I really don't remember very much about what happened\r\nafterward. I mean it was just----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I mean between, in the 15 minutes preceding the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I remember hearing on the radio that the President was\r\npassing Ervay Street. It wasn't on our radio, somebody else's radio,\r\nand that is about all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the way, what color dress were you wearing that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Oh, my, I am fairly certain I was either wearing a green\r\nsuit or red and gray suit, but I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of coat, if you were wearing a coat?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I was wearing a brown coat, brown suede coat.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what your husband was wearing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He was wearing a plaid sports jacket, probably. I am not\r\nsure which sports jacket, but I think he was wearing a plaid sports\r\njacket that was blue and had some black and grey in it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he wearing any overcoat over the sports jacket?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Oh, no; I wasn't wearing that brown coat, I don't think.\r\nI think I was wearing an olive coat. He probably had his overcoat, but\r\nit is more of a raincoat.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you wearing gloves?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he wearing gloves?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you wearing a hat?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; a scarf.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he wearing a hat, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He might have been. He wears one sometimes. Sometimes he\r\ndoesn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else you remember about what happened\r\nprior to the time the motorcade came by?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, will you please tell us what happened as the\r\nmotorcade went by?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, Mrs. Kennedy was wearing a blue--I mean a pink or\r\nmaybe a rose--it was either pink or rose dress or suit, I couldn't say,\r\nbecause she was sitting. She had a pink hat or rose, the same shade as\r\nher dress.\r\n\r\nAnd I remember noticing that the President's hair was sort of red, that\r\nis all. They were facing mainly toward the other side of the street and\r\nwaving, and as they turned the corner we heard a shot, and I didn't\r\nrecognize it as being a shot. I just heard a sound, and I thought it\r\nmight be a firecracker.\r\n\r\nAnd the people started laughing at first, and then we heard two more\r\nshots, and they were closer than the first and second, and that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear all told?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you said you heard two more shots that were closer than\r\nthe first and second, what did you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I meant the second and third were closer than the first\r\nand second.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Rowland, did you have any idea where the shots came\r\nfrom or the sound?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, the people generally ran towards the railroad\r\ntracks behind the School Book Depository Building, and so I naturally\r\nassumed they came from there, because that is where all the policemen\r\nand everyone was going, and I couldn't tell where the sounds came from.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you just started over after them?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did your husband go with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; I grabbed his hand and he couldn't go anyplace else.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you running or walking over there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. It wasn't a very fast run, but it wasn't a walk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk about anything, about the man that you had seen\r\nin the window?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No. But he was reluctant to start running, and he might\r\nhave been looking up there, I don't know. But we didn't say anything\r\nabout the man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got over there? Where did you run\r\nto?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. To the colonnade over on the north side of Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As Elm Street goes down to the freeway?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then where did you go?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We walked towards the railroad tracks, but the policeman\r\nwouldn't let anybody go further.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We just stood there and he was speculating on what had\r\nhappened, and he was looking around at everything, and the policeman\r\ninspected a Coke drink bottle that was there, and my husband found a\r\npen, very cheap ballpoint pen that you get as an advertisement, and he\r\ngave it to the policeman, and then he mentioned the man he had seen in\r\nthe School Book Depository Building, and then the man took us to the\r\nrecords building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who did your husband mention this to? Was this some police\r\nofficer?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not certain. The first man he mentioned it to was\r\nwearing plain clothes, and we didn't see him again, I don't think. And\r\nthen there were some other men who took us to the building. I don't\r\nknow who they were.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do when you got to the building? Did you\r\nstay with your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was questioned in the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear what your husband said?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you describe what went on in the building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. When we first came in, we went into an office that had\r\nglass windows around it. There was a man sitting there with a child. I\r\nthink it was a boy and he said that he had seen the President shot and\r\nhe said that--he didn't say there were three shots, I think he said\r\nthere was one, or maybe he said there were more than three, but he\r\ndidn't say there were three shots.\r\n\r\nThen we went out into an open area in the building, a fairly open area,\r\nand there were some reporters in there, and they started asking us\r\nquestions which we didn't answer, because mainly we didn't have time.\r\n\r\nThen we were taken into a very small office and a lady took his written\r\nstatement and my statement, and there were three other people who came\r\nin, three other witnesses who come in.\r\n\r\nThere were two young men together, and one young lady who came in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, when you gave your statement to the police\r\nand your husband gave his statement to the police, or to whoever the\r\npeople were taking the statement, do you remember what your husband\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. Do I have to tell you again?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, did he say substantially what you said?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that he said that you haven't related here?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I believe he may have said that the man had dark hair.\r\nEither he said that the man had dark hair, or he didn't see what color\r\nthe man's hair was. And he said just about the same thing I said here,\r\nI think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, anything else that was said there by your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't remember anything else.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did your husband at that time say whether or not he had kept\r\nany watch on the window of the School Book Depository Building after he\r\nsaw this man with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean he----\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He didn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether or not he had seen any other people in\r\nthe windows of the School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; I am fairly certain that he said there were other\r\npeople looking out the windows.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether or not there were any other people on\r\nthat same floor looking out the windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not certain whether he said or not. But I know there\r\nweren't any other people on that floor looking out the windows that\r\ncould be seen from the outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I mean I know they couldn't be seen from the outside,\r\nbecause I couldn't see them. I am nearsighted.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you keeping any watch on the building after the time\r\nyou saw the man with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look up at that building from time to time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, I didn't pay any special attention to the building,\r\nbut I am sure I glanced at the building more than once afterwards,\r\nbecause I can't just stand and stare in one direction.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you mean you were just glancing at that building as you\r\nwere glancing at other places?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you were glancing at that building, do you remember\r\nwhether you glanced at it, say, within 10 minutes prior to the\r\nmotorcade?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't remember. But most of the windows on that floor\r\nwere closed, and the people who were looking out usually were looking\r\nout at an open window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any people look out of any open windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how many did you see all told, if you can remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROLAND. Two or three, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any more than two or three looking out of windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether or not any of those that you saw\r\nlooking out of windows were looking out of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. They weren't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. They were not? Were they on any floor higher than the sixth\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were they all on floors lower than the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did your husband state in the presence of you at any\r\ntime while he was giving any of these statements on the afternoon\r\nof November 22, whether or not he saw any people looking out of the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did he say he saw them?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He didn't say exactly where he saw them, but the windows\r\non the floor above the sixth floor were all closed, and I think they\r\nwere never open.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. So they wouldn't have been on the seventh floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether or not he saw any people looking out of\r\nany other windows on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He didn't say, I don't believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say what floor? He didn't say whether he did or did\r\nnot, is that your testimony, or did he say that he did not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't believe he said whether or not he saw any other\r\npeople on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did he say about what he saw? Do you remember about how\r\nmany people he said he saw looking out of the windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't believe he said any certain number of people.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything that he said about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He just said that there were some other people looking\r\nout of some windows in the same building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he specifically locate them in any way?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, is there any other thing that your husband\r\nsaid in your presence that afternoon pertaining to this School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay over there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We were there until about 2:00 or 3:00, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Then we left and walked around town and tried to get a\r\nnewspaper, and before we left, we knew that the President was dead.\r\n\r\nFrom that--for a while, we were in a room alone with a lady who came in\r\nto testify, and said that she had seen a blond man carrying a rifle in\r\na rifle bag, and he said that probably it couldn't have been the man he\r\nsaw because the man he saw was dark-haired.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did this woman say where she was--where she saw the\r\nblond-haired man?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I believe she said in front of some sporting goods store.\r\nI am not certain.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did she say where the sporting goods store was?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Some place downtown, but I don't remember exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it in the immediate vicinity of the School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Meaning?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Within a block of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did she say when she saw a blond-haired man carrying a rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not positive exactly what time she said, but it was\r\nbefore, she said, she heard about the President being shot, and she\r\ncame back there to tell them she had seen a man earlier carrying a gun\r\nin a rifle case.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. She had seen some man, that had blond hair, downtown\r\ncarrying a gun in a rifle case?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is all she knew?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, I believe that is all she knew.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can add?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, there were two young men who came in too, and they\r\nsaid something about seeing a man carrying a rifle downtown. I believe\r\nthey also said he was a blond man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. That he was over 6 feet, and he was well built, from what\r\nthey said, and that is all I know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did your husband say about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He didn't comment, I don't think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything else that took place while you and your\r\nhusband were over giving your statements, that you can think of right\r\nnow? Anything else that your husband said?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then, where did you go?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. We left and we walked in an easterly direction and we\r\nwent to a coin shop and looked around for a while, and then I went home\r\nand he went to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he working?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. At the Pizza Inn on West Davis. He caught a bus and went\r\nto work, and I caught a bus and went home.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what happened? When did you see him next?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, wait a minute, I didn't go home very soon. The\r\nbus--there was poor bus service, and I didn't go home until quite,\r\nuntil about 9:00, I think, and I saw him the next morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had he been contacted at the Pizza Inn later that night, do\r\nyou know, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, were either you or he contacted at any time\r\nduring that day by any law enforcement agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't think we were contacted the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would have been Saturday?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Saturday, I know we weren't. I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When were you next contacted, either on that Saturday or\r\nthat Sunday?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I think so. I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you how many times after November 22 were you\r\ncontacted by some law enforcement agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Me personally?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You personally.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I spoke to law enforcement officers about three or four\r\ntimes, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how many times in November? Once on the 22d?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. And we were contacted once Sunday morning at the\r\nPizza Inn during November. I think it was the next Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. And we were contacted one morning, I am not\r\npositive, I think it might have been that Saturday, the following\r\nSaturday, the 23d--the Saturday following the assassination, at my\r\nmother's home, and I am not positive how many times.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you present at any of these times that your husband was\r\ncontacted?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you present, for instance, on the Sunday morning,\r\nNovember 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what your husband said at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He repeated the statement he had made in the--well, the\r\npolice officers brought a written statement and asked him if that was\r\nin general what he had to say, and he said, \"Yes,\" and they asked him\r\nspecific questions about it and he answered them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything else that was said?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything that your husband said that was not on\r\nthat written statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember him saying anything--do you remember him\r\ntelling the police officer that the statement was correct, or do you\r\nremember him telling them anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; he signed. There might have been a change or two in\r\nthe statement and then he signed it and said that he verified that it\r\nwas correct, to the best of his knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell the police officer anything that was not on that\r\nstatement that should be?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he asked whether or not he saw any other people in any\r\nother windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't believe he was specifically asked that question.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell any of the police officers that he saw any\r\npeople in any other windows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I am not certain.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not he told them, the police\r\nofficers, that there was any other person on the sixth floor that he\r\nsaw?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He never said that there was another person on the sixth\r\nfloor, in my presence, that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you present when he was with the police officers?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. At times.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On Sunday morning, November 24th?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you personally with him throughout the time that he was\r\nwith the police officers?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And he, in your presence, never said that he saw anyone on\r\nthe sixth floor other than the man with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No. He never said in my presence that there was another\r\nman other than the man with the rifle on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It is a little bit like there has been asked a negative\r\nquestion and you don't know whether to answer yes or no to the\r\nquestion, is that right, Mrs. Rowland?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now were you present at any subsequent interviews that your\r\nhusband had with any law enforcement agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I was present when Mr. Howlett came to ask, to tell him\r\nthat he should go to Washington, that he wanted him to go to Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did your husband say to that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He said, \"Okay.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he talk to you, by the way, about his testimony when he\r\ngot back from Washington? Did he talk to you about his testimony in\r\nfront of the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Has he ever talked to you about his testimony? Before you\r\ncame down here, for instance, has he talked to you about what he said\r\nin front of the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Going back to his interview with the police, do you know how\r\nmany interviews he had after the one on Sunday, November 24?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I think he had about six or eight interviews in all. I\r\nmean all inclusive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that include the one with Mr. Howlett telling him to\r\ngo to Washington?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes. I am not positive of the number.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. From November 24 to November 30, that\r\nweek, do you know how many interviews he had?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, has he ever told you that he had seen anyone else on\r\nthe sixth floor other than this man with the gun that you described in\r\nthe southwest corner window?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Has he ever told you that he told anyone else that he saw\r\nanyone else on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did your husband ever complain to you that he was being\r\nquestioned too much by any law enforcement agency?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't think so, not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever complain to you that any statement that he gave\r\nwas not taken down?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there any complaint that he ever made to you about law\r\nenforcement agencies?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not about the law enforcement agencies, but in the Dallas\r\nMorning News on February 11, 14--11th or 14th, they had an article in\r\nthere, and they had some things in the article that he didn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Like what?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Like that the man was good looking. I mean, because he\r\nsaid he couldn't recognize the man. That is what he told me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Apart from what the Dallas Morning News said, then, did he\r\nhave any complaints about his contacts with either the FBI or Secret\r\nService or the sheriffs office or the city police of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. None that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Rowland, you made a statement toward the beginning part\r\nof this deposition that your husband said that he had all A's, but that\r\nyou knew different, because you had seen the report card.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. He said he had an A average.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But that you knew different?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Well, he may have had an A average overall A average, but\r\nsome of his cards didn't have A's altogether.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you mentioned that he had A's and B's and some C's and\r\nsome D's?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. The one I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what years those would have been for?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sometimes some people are prone to exaggerate more than\r\nothers, and without in any way meaning to take away from the testimony\r\nof your husband as to what he saw in the building at the time, just\r\nfrom your general experience, do you feel you can rely on everything\r\nthat your husband says?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I don't feel that I can rely on everything anybody says.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, this is really an unfair question for me to ask any\r\nwife about her husband, and I am not asking it very correctly, but----\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. At times my husband is prone to exaggerate. Does that\r\nanswer it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I think it does.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you want to add to that, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Usually his exaggerations are not concerned with anything\r\nother than himself. They are usually to boast his ego. They usually say\r\nthat he is really smarter than he is, or he is a better salesman than\r\nhe is, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you care to add?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Again, I apologize for any--for in any way trying to\r\nembarrass you or anything, but your husband did see a man on the sixth\r\nfloor and it is important for us to try and find out everything we can\r\nto test his accuracy as to what he saw, and so this is why I have been\r\nasking these questions.\r\n\r\nYou and I have never met before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not that I ever remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When we did meet, I immediately brought you in here and we\r\nstarted taking your deposition under oath, isn't that true?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We didn't chat about anything before we started taking your\r\ndeposition, did we?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you mentioned the fact that the newspaper misquoted your\r\nhusband?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any other time when you know that he complained\r\nabout being misquoted insofar as the facts of the assassination are\r\nconcerned?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. When we had our first written statement, the police\r\nofficer, I believe he was an FBI agent, restated everything we said,\r\nand it was typed in the--in that form. But he also asked if it was,\r\nif that was the general meaning of what we had said, so he didn't\r\ncomplain. But anyway, it wasn't in his exact words, I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything inaccurate about the statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No; I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did your husband ever make any complaints to you about\r\nanything inaccurate in any statements that he had given?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. If he did, I don't remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can think of that might in\r\nany way be relevant to this whole area of inquiry?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. Did you or your husband rather, ever\r\nsee a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald on television?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. I saw either the actual shooting on television of Mr.\r\nOswald or either a rerun, and I saw his picture in the newspaper, but I\r\ndon't know if my husband ever saw it or not.\r\n\r\nBut he did--we heard on the radio the afternoon of the assassination\r\nthat Lee Harvey Oswald had been accused of the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you or your husband know anyone by the name of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you or your husband know Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Not to my knowledge, I never have known him, and I don't\r\nthink he has. If he has, he never told me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we certainly appreciate your coming down here. You\r\nhave been most helpful, Mrs. Rowland.\r\n\r\nOne final thing. You have an opportunity to either come back and read\r\nwhat the court reporter has, the transcript after it is typed, and sign\r\nit, or else you can waive coming down and taking the time to read it\r\nand sign it, and have it go directly to Washington.\r\n\r\nDo you care to come down to read it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If you like to, you have every right to do so.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; I would.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You will be contacted then, and you can come down and read\r\nit and make any corrections, if you like.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes; could I, other than making corrections have it\r\nrewritten in better English?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No, I'm afraid my English at times isn't very good,\r\nMrs. Rowland, and we have to let it go the way it is right now. By\r\ncorrections, I mean anything where you feel the court reporter might\r\nnot have accurately transcribed the words that you and I said here.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If either one used bad grammar, the English teachers will\r\nhave to look down their noses at us.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROWLAND. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF RONALD B. FISCHER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Ronald B. Fischer was taken at 11:20 a.m., on April\r\n1, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Fischer, will you rise to be sworn, please, and raise\r\nyour right hand?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you please state your name?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Ronald B. Fischer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where do you live, Mr. Fischer?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. 4007 Flamingo Way, Mesquite, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is this a suburb of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I'm an auditor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For whom?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Dallas County auditor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where do you work?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I work at 407 records building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where is the records building?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. That's in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. It covers one square block area bounded by Main, Record,\r\nElm, and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you, Mr. Fischer?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Twenty-five.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Married?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Children?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Two.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to school here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes--high school, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What high school did you go to?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. W. W. Samuell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you complete high school or not?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you participated in any postgraduate work since you\r\ngraduated from high school?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I've taken courses toward an accounting degree at\r\nArlington State College, Arlington, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are these correspondence courses or have you actually\r\nattended the school?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; I've attended the school.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you attend that school?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I attended 1 year, full time and I attended 1 year, night\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what have you done since after you left Arlington?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. All of the time since I've left Arlington, I've been\r\nworking for the Dallas County auditor--with the exception of a\r\ncorrespondence course that I'm taking at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, by that, you mean you're still working full time but\r\nyou are taking the correspondence course also?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been working for 4 or 5 years for the auditor's\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Five years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mr. Fischer, I want to take you back to November 22,\r\n1963, and ask you if you remember watching or getting ready to watch,\r\nthe Presidential motorcade on that day? Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And were you with anyone else, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Bob Edwards--he works in the same office that I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Does he work there now?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; he doesn't. At the present time, he's attending a\r\ncollege in Oklahoma but I don't remember the name. It's in Tahlequah, I\r\nbelieve. I don't know the name of the college.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could that be--I think it's [spelling] T-a-h-l-e-q-u-a-h?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I think that's it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, when did you and Mr. Edwards leave your place of\r\nemployment on that day to watch the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Oh, about--well, let's see. We got off for lunch at a\r\nquarter of twelve and Mr. Lynn, our boss, said that we could take--go\r\nahead and go on down the street after we got through with lunch, in\r\nother words, don't come back to the office after lunch. Just go on\r\ndown the street and watch the parade. Everybody was due back after the\r\nparade was over.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. So, I went to lunch at a quarter of twelve, and ate until\r\nabout 12 o'clock, and then Bob and I went down to the street--oh, 5\r\nor 10 after 12--and we stood, at first, on Main Street right outside\r\nthe records building. And then about 12:15 or 12:20, we were trying to\r\nfind a place where we could see better, so we walked down to Houston\r\nand then one block down Houston to Elm and stood there until the parade\r\ncame by.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, do you know when you got to corner of Houston and\r\nElm--approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. About 12:20.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 12:20?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where were you standing on the corner of Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. We were standing right on the curb--uh--on the southwest\r\ncorner of Elm and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you with relation to that lagoon that's there?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, that lagoon is rather long. We were standing in\r\nfront of it, across the sidewalk. I believe it's the curb and the\r\nsidewalk and this little bit of grass, and then the lagoon. And we\r\nwere standing right on the curb there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were standing on the curb at about the point where the\r\nactual curve of the curb is at the intersection--or not?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I'd say where the curb starts to curve. Because, when the\r\nshots were fired, we looked around at the motorcade and couldn't see\r\nit--because--uh--of the people that were standing along the curb there.\r\nWe just couldn't see it. Had we been on further around, we could have\r\njust looked down the street and seen it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So, you would have been really standing on the curb which\r\nwould be the west curb of Houston Street, just where it starts to make\r\nthe curve to go onto Elm there. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, would you describe what you saw as you were standing on\r\nthat curb?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. About 10 or 15 seconds before the parade--first car of\r\nthe parade came around the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what corner is that?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Of Houston and Main.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Which would have been the first time we could have seen\r\nany of the cars because of the building--about 10 or 15 seconds before\r\nthe first car came around that corner, Bob punched me and said, \"Look\r\nat that guy there in that window.\" And he made some remark--said, \"He\r\nlooks like he's uncomfortable\"--or something.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked up and I watched the man for, oh, I'd say, 10 or 15\r\nseconds. It was until the first car came around the corner of\r\nHouston and Main. And, then, when that car did come around the\r\ncorner, I took my attention off of the man in the window and started\r\nwatching the parade. The man held my attention for 10 or 15 seconds,\r\nbecause he appeared uncomfortable for one, and, secondly, he wasn't\r\nwatching--uh--he didn't look like he was watching for the parade. He\r\nlooked like he was looking down toward the Trinity River and the triple\r\nunderpass down at the end--toward the end of Elm Street. And--uh--all\r\nthe time I watched him, he never moved his head, he never--he never\r\nmoved anything. Just was there transfixed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what window did you see the man?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. It was the corner window on Houston Street facing Elm, in\r\nthe fifth or sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On what side of the--first of all, what building was this\r\nyou saw him in?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. The Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what side of the building would the window have been in?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. It would have been--well, as you're looking toward the\r\nfront of the building, it would have been to your right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, the building itself has four sides--a north, east,\r\nsouth, and a west side--the entire sides of the building. Would this\r\nhave been the north, south, east, or west side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. It would have been the south side--the entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, on that south side of the building--now, was\r\nit the center part of the south side, the east part of the south side,\r\nor the west part of the south side?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. The east part of the south side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, with reference to the east corner of the south side there--would\r\nit have been the first window next to that corner, the second, the\r\nthird, or the fourth--or what?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. First window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the east corner of the south side?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about the man? Could you describe\r\nhis appearance at all? First of all, how much of him could you see?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I could see from about the middle of his chest past the\r\ntop of his head.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. He was in the--as you're looking toward that window, he\r\nwas in the lower right portion of the window. He seemed to be sitting a\r\nlittle forward.\r\n\r\nAnd he had--he had on an open-neck shirt, but it--uh--could have been\r\na sport shirt or a T-shirt. It was light in color; probably white,\r\nI couldn't tell whether it had long sleeves or whether it was a\r\nshort-sleeved shirt, but it was open-neck and light in color.\r\n\r\nUh--he had a slender face and neck--uh--and he had a light\r\ncomplexion--he was a white man. And he looked to be 22 or 24 years old.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about the color of his hair?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. His hair seemed to be--uh--neither light nor dark;\r\npossibly a light--well, possibly a--well, it was a brown was what it\r\nwas; but as to whether it was light or dark, I can't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he have a thick head of hair or did he have a receding\r\nhair-line--or couldn't you tell?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I couldn't tell. He couldn't have had very long hair,\r\nbecause his hair didn't seem to take up much space--of what I could see\r\nof his head. His hair must have been short and not long.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, did you see a full view of his face or more of a\r\nprofile of it, or what was it?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I saw it at an angle but, at the same time, I could see--I\r\nbelieve I could see the tip of his right cheek as he looked to my left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, could you be anything more definite as to what\r\ndirection he was looking at?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. He looked to me like he was looking straight at the triple\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Down what street?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Down Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Toward the end of Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As it angles there and goes under the triple underpass there?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see his hands?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see whether or not he was holding anything?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; I couldn't see.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see any other objects in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. There were boxes and cases stacked all the way from\r\nthe bottom to the top and from the left to the right behind him. It\r\nlooked--uh--it's possible that there weren't cases directly behind him\r\nbecause I couldn't see because of him. But--uh--all the rest of the\r\nwindow--a portion behind the window--there were boxes. It looked like\r\nthere was space for a man to walk through there between the window and\r\nthe boxes. But there were boxes in the window, or close to the window\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see any other people in any other windows there\r\nthat you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I couldn't see any other people in the windows. I don't\r\nremember seeing any others.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By this, do you mean that you are sure there were none, or\r\nthat you just do not remember seeing any?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I don't remember seeing any.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, after you saw the man, then the motorcade turned onto\r\nHouston from Main--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see the man again in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever look back at the window?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I never looked back at the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, could you describe what happened as you watched the\r\nmotorcade turn? First, about how fast did the motorcade appear to be\r\ngoing?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. When the motorcade passed me, it was--uh--the driver was\r\nin process of making the wide turn there from Houston to Elm, and he\r\nwas going very slow. I'd say, uh--10-15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, the motorcade--the limousine made the wide turn\r\nand--uh--they went out of our view just as they began to straighten up\r\nonto Elm Street because there were people standing along the curb all\r\nthe way around--and that's when the limousine went out of my view and I\r\nstarted watching the other cars behind the Presidential limousine.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, as I looked around to watch these other\r\ncars, I heard a shot. At first I thought it was a firecracker.\r\nAnd--uh--everybody got quiet. There was no yelling or shouting or\r\nanything. Everything seemed to get real still. And--uh--the second shot\r\nrang out, and then everybody--from where I was standing--everybody\r\nstarted to scatter. And--uh--then the third shot.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought there were four, but as I think about it more,\r\nthere must have been just three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At first, you thought there were four shots?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you said the first one you thought was a firecracker?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the second one? Did you think that was a\r\nfirecracker, too?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No. When the second shot rang out. It was too much like\r\nthe first to be a firecracker. I have heard high-powered rifles\r\nfire before. The--uh--first shot fooled me, I think, because of the\r\nsound bouncing off the buildings. But the second shot was too much\r\nlike the first and it was too loud--both shots were too loud to be a\r\nfirecracker. And I knew it was a shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you had any experience with high-powered rifles before?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Very little; but I have shot several.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the third shot? Did you think that was a\r\nfirecracker or what?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; I knew it was a shot, too. I knew someone was shooting\r\nat something. Uh--it didn't--it still didn't dawn on me that anyone\r\nwould try to shoot at the President, but I knew that somebody was\r\nshooting at something. I didn't know whether it was a real pistol or a\r\nreal rifle--but I knew somebody was shooting a firearm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did the shots appear to be coming from?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. They appeared to be coming from just west of the School\r\nBook Depository Building. There were some railroad tracks and there\r\nwere some railroad cars back in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And they appeared to be coming from those railroad cars?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, that area somewhere. From where I was standing, I\r\ncouldn't see the cars themselves until I had run across the street and\r\nup the hill.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The shots seemed to be how far apart?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. That's hard to say. I've been thinking about that.\r\nAnd-uh--I'd guess--3 to 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that between the first and the second or between the\r\nsecond and the third?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Between both. As far as I can remember, the shots were\r\nevenly spaced.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else about the shots that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No--only that they were very loud.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else about the man in the window that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. (Pausing before reply.) No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. What did you do or see or hear after you hear the\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. After the second shot we, Bob and I both, started running\r\ndown the sidewalk on Elm Street, on the south side of Elm, and there\r\nwere still people that were milling around and shuffling around. When\r\nthe second shot broke, like I say, a lot of people started running,\r\nsome people still stood but a lot of people started running. Uh--and\r\nthen when the third shot went off, we just almost reached the curb and\r\nthen just as the limousine went under the triple underpass, we got to\r\nthe street--Elm Street--where we could actually see--uh--well--where\r\nthe shots had gone, and--uh--we ran across the street where there were\r\na man, his wife and two children laying on the ground. Now, that was\r\non the north side of Elm Street about halfway between Houston and the\r\ntriple underpass and we ran down there where this man and his wife and\r\ntwo boys were. Someone was helping them up off the ground, and the man\r\nsaid at that time that the President had been shot.\r\n\r\nAnd, after that, we stood there for 10 or 15 seconds and then we ran up\r\nto the top of the hill there where all the Secret Service men had run,\r\nthinking that that's where the bullets had come from since they seemed\r\nto be searching that area over there. They jumped off--out of cars\r\nand ran up the side of the hill there and onto the tracks where these\r\npassenger--freight cars were.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. (Pausing before reply.) No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after that, then?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. After that, we went back up to the building where we\r\nwork--the records building--and went on upstairs to the office. And\r\nthat's where Bob and I separated and--he had some things to do--I think\r\nhe had some stuff that had to go down to another office and he left.\r\nAfter we got up there, he got some paper and then left. I stayed there\r\nfor a little while and----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, first of all, about when did you get back to the\r\nrecords building do you feel?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Uh--it must have been 5--5 minutes after the first shot\r\nwas fired. Something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. When you went back there, did you walk by the\r\nfront of the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; when we went back, we came--we went back the same way\r\nwe came. We went straight across Elm and then up to Houston on the\r\nsouth side of Elm, and then crossed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice whether or not people were going in or coming\r\nout of the School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. There seemed to be a lot of people around--uh--the front;\r\nbut, of course, there were a lot of people all over the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. You got back up to the building--the records\r\nbuilding--and then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, as I said, we went up to the fourth floor to our\r\noffice. Uh--I stayed there for 5 or 10 minutes. Bob had left. And then\r\nI went next door in the purchasing department where they've got a\r\nradio. I was trying to--I didn't--I don't guess I really believed yet\r\nthat it had happened--that the President had been shot. And--uh--I was\r\ntrying to find out on the radio just exactly what did happen.\r\n\r\nAnd I stayed in the purchasing department 5 minutes or so--well, 5 or\r\n10 minutes, and then I went back down the hall where some people had a\r\nradio standing out in the hall. They had another station on, and still\r\nnobody knew anything.\r\n\r\nThen, I went back to the office about--oh, maybe 5 or 10 minutes till\r\n1, and-uh--we heard a bunch of sirens, police cars, and leaned out the\r\nwindow, and police cars were all surrounding the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building. And when I saw all that and saw the detectives\r\nin the window, the officers, I knew that--I realized that the\r\nshots--that they must have the assassin in there or the man who did the\r\nshooting--or something was wrong with the building.\r\n\r\nSo, I realized then that it possibly was the man I saw since he was the\r\nonly one I remember in a window and that it had something to do with\r\nthe building--that it's possible that the man I saw had something to do\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAbout that time a deputy from the sheriff's office came up and asked me\r\nif I was Ronald Fischer, and I said, \"Yes;\" and he said that Sheriff\r\nDecker wanted to see me in his office right now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time was this now?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. This was at--oh--1 o'clock on or about 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You then went to Sheriff Decker's office?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I went to Decker's office and--uh--Bob Edwards was in\r\nthere. He looked up--and he had given them my name and told them--at\r\nleast, this is what he told me--that he told them that we had both\r\nbeen standing there together and had seen this man in the window of\r\nthe School Book Depository Building. So, that's why they came to get\r\nme--because he had told them.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of other people in the office--12 or 15 other people.\r\nThey all seemed to be connected with it in some way or another. And I\r\nnoticed, too, in Sheriff Decker's office was this man and woman and two\r\nboys that we had talked to down the street there on Elm that had hit\r\nthe ground when the shots started.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, this man that you saw in the window--did he appear to\r\nbe standing or sitting--or couldn't you tell?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. He must not have been standing because I don't think the\r\nfloor was that far away. He could have been standing--I'll take that\r\nback. He would have had to have been crouched over. He didn't look like\r\nhe was crouched over or bent over. He must have been--I'm guessing--but\r\nI'm thinking he must have been on his knees or maybe sitting, on a box\r\nmaybe. But he--I don't think that it's possible that he was standing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he sitting or crouching, or whatever he was doing, in a\r\nstraight-up position?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; he was leaning forward slightly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far forward was he leaning--or couldn't you tell?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Oh, it was slightly--enough to where I could tell,\r\nbut--oh--his head wasn't out of the window and his head wasn't past the\r\nwindow sill. If he had been much further back in, it would have been\r\nhard for me to see him at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, sometime afterwards, you signed a written statement at\r\nthe sheriff's office--is that it?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And, later, did some policemen bring out a picture of an\r\nindividual and ask you to try and identify him?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did they tell you whose picture it was?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Whose picture did they say it was?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, they actually showed me two pictures--one of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald, and one of Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. And what did you say?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I told them that that could have been the man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, which one did you say could have been the man?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Lee Harvey Oswald. That that could have been the man that\r\nI saw in the window of the School Book Depository Building, but that I\r\nwas not sure. It's possible that a man fit the general description that\r\nI gave--but I can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything different--do you remember the\r\npicture?--between the picture you saw and the man you saw in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes; one thing--and that is in the picture he looked\r\nlike he hadn't shaved in several days at least. And--uh--I don't know\r\nwhether at that distance, looking at him from the street in the School\r\nBook Depository Building--if I could have been able to--if I could have\r\nseen that. I think, if he had been unshaven in the window, it would\r\nhave made his complexion appear--well--rather dark; but I remember his\r\ncomplexion was light; that is, unless he had just a light beard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the sun shining on his face when you saw him in the\r\nwindow or not--or don't you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; uh--no the sun wasn't shining on his face. He was back\r\nin the shadow of the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did the policeman come out with this picture--on the\r\nsame day or on the next day?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No; it was--uh--no, it was several days after. I can't\r\nremember whether it was a week or 2 weeks or--it was at least a week. I\r\ndon't remember exactly when it was but it was a week, at least.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this: Was there anything else different\r\nbetween the man you saw in the picture and the man you saw in the\r\nwindow?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. (Pausing before reply.) No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the color of his hair? Do you remember what the\r\ncolor of the hair was of the man in the picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes; it was brown. It was a darker shade of brown but it\r\nwas definitely brown.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean, \"a darker shade of brown?\"\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, it wasn't--it wasn't--uh--well, I guess there are\r\na lot of shades of brown. But it wasn't--uh--it wasn't a light brown.\r\nIt was a--in the picture it showed up as definitely a darker brown. I\r\ncan't think of anything to compare it to.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, when you saw the man in the window, did he appear to\r\nhave light brown hair, dark brown, medium brown--or what kind of hair\r\ndid he have?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, it wasn't dark and it wasn't light. Uh--he didn't\r\nhave black hair and he didn't have blonde hair. It--uh--must have been\r\na brown but, like I say, there are a lot of different shades of brown\r\nand I'm not--I can't--it's hard for me to say just exactly what shade\r\nof brown I saw that he had. I know what shade he had in the picture\r\nbut----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, I hand you a copy of a statement which I believe--at\r\nleast has the signature on it--and ask you to see if this looks like\r\nit's your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. [After perusing paper.] Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. I'm going to call this \"Fischer Deposition\r\nExhibit No. 1,\" and ask you to read this statement, which appears to be\r\ndated November 22, 1963, and ask you to state if there's anything in\r\nthat statement that does not appear to be accurate.\r\n\r\n(Thereupon, the statement of Mr. Fischer dated Nov. 22, 1963, is\r\nidentified as \"Fischer Deposition Exhibit No. 1.)\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. You want me to read this now?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can just read it to yourself and then you can tell me\r\nwhen you get through whether or not there is anything in that statement\r\nthat doesn't appear to be accurate.\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. [After reading Exhibit No. 1.] That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is this what you told these people there?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, in this statement it says that the man appeared to be\r\nin his twenties--is that what you told them?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It says that all you could see was his head, now you've told\r\nme here today that you could see his chest?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes; from the middle of his chest up. I could see his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nUh--the man taking that particular piece of paper was a court reporter\r\nin the records building, and he didn't--he didn't relate--he had about\r\n12 of these things to take--well, yeah, 12 or 15--however many people\r\nthere were in the sheriff's office at that time. And he was, like\r\nI say, he was in a hurry to get it down and I said I could see his\r\nhead--and, so, he put that down. And that is right. I could see his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The statement here says that he was light-headed and that he\r\nhad on an open-neck shirt. Did he have an open-neck shirt on?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, what about being light-headed?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. By \"light-headed,\" I meant that he didn't have black hair.\r\nHe didn't have dark--he didn't have--well, when I say \"dark,\" I mean\r\nblack. He didn't have black hair. He didn't have blonde hair. When I\r\nsaid, \"light-headed,\" I didn't mean blonde--or I would have said that,\r\nbut--uh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What color of hair did you mean? Did you say \"light-headed\"?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I believe I did say \"light-headed\"--because I didn't--like\r\nI say--I didn't want it to appear that he was dark.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By \"dark,\" what color do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Black.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, once again, I'll ask you, to the best of your\r\nrecollection, what color hair did he have?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Uh--like I say, it's too hard for me to--uh--to tell one\r\nway or the other. At the distance I was, uh--it's just--it's just too\r\nhard for me to--I'm not going to say it because I don't know for sure,\r\njust exactly what shade of hair he did have. It wasn't blonde and it\r\nwasn't black. Somewhere in between. And it was a shade of brown that\r\nas to whether it was a dark brown, a light brown, a medium brown, or\r\nwhatever you call it--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThe statement says that you saw him in the window there. Do you\r\nremember how far the window was open?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. The window was open almost all the way open if not, all\r\nthe way open.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By that \"all the way\"--when you have a window all the way\r\nopen of that kind, of course, you just have a half of the window case\r\nthat is open. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. That's right, You still have half an area of the opening\r\ncovered by glass.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it the bottom area that was open or the top area?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. The bottom area. The window looked to be--uh--a window\r\nthat raised from the bottom up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And it appeared to be almost as fully open as you could, or\r\nfully open?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Or fully open. Yes--Or I wouldn't have been able to see\r\nthe cases and see past the top of his head had it not been--and his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, on this written statement it says that you remember a\r\ntall girl walking into the School Book Depository Building there at\r\nabout the time you saw the man?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see such a girl walk in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I can't remember. It must have been before. It must have\r\nbeen just before--uh--I saw the man in the window. I can't remember\r\nvery well. It's been too long. I believe it was before I saw the man in\r\nthe window that I saw her walk into the building. Like I say, I made a\r\nmental note of it but I didn't pay too much attention at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, sometime later, after November 22, you were interviewed\r\nby the FBI. Do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes; in the records building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And did the FBI man have any pictures with him at all, or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I don't remember whether he had pictures or not. It seems\r\nlike he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you identify the man you saw in the window from any of\r\nthe pictures?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Uh--not--in fact, I believe they asked me--I believe they\r\ndid have pictures of him. It seems like I recall them asking me if it\r\ncould have been the picture that they identified as Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nor if it could have been the picture of Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what did you say about the Jack Ruby picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I told them that I didn't think it could be him\r\nbecause--uh--he didn't--he didn't have near enough hair, it didn't look\r\nlike to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about his build?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. And that, too. His face was just a little--uh--fat;\r\nwhereas-uh--Oswald's picture was rather a slender face and neck.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the man you saw in the window have a high forehead or a\r\nlow forehead--or do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I can't--I can't remember seeing that--uh--that well. I\r\ndon't know if I could have--if I saw it now, whether I could tell you\r\nwhether he had a large forehead or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you have any estimate of how far you were from that\r\nwindow when you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Uh--from the point where I was standing when I saw him in\r\nthe window to him, it must have been, I would say, at least a hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, did you ever tell anyone, or might you have\r\ntold them, that you saw this person a minute or two before you saw the\r\nmotorcade, rather than as you told us here today, 15 or 20 seconds\r\nbefore you first saw the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever tell anyone it was a minute or two before you\r\nsaw the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Well, I might have said \"a minute or two\" in just terms. I\r\ndon't remember saying that but.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But what is the----\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Shortly before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Shortly?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Shortly before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you definitely remember that it was this 15 or 20 seconds\r\nor so before you saw the motorcade, or might it have been a minute or\r\ntwo before you saw the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I don't think it was over a minute. It could--it was less\r\nthan a minute--because, as I recall, that's what--that's the reason I\r\nturned my attention from him and I looked back down the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Is there anything else you can think of that\r\nbears on the assassination, or anything you saw or did or heard that\r\nyou haven't related here?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. (Pausing before reply.) No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you say \"No\"?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. No--I can't think of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Shortly before this interview began, you and I met for the\r\nfirst time--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And we first chatted a few minutes about what you saw before\r\nwe started taking your testimony on the record?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the fact as to whether or not I asked you to tell me\r\nyour story or whether or not, instead, I asked you questions and tried\r\nto, in any way, lead you--or so forth?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. I answered the questions as I think that I saw the events\r\nhappen--as I saw the events happen. I was not quizzed on what to say or\r\nanything of that nature. I've merely related what I think that I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything that you told me of before we\r\nstarted taking the deposition that has not been included in this\r\ndeposition--that you can think of?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. [Pausing before reply.] No; not that I can think of.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nI believe that ends the deposition.\r\n\r\nI want to thank you for your courtesy in coming here, Mr. Fischer. We\r\nappreciate your taking the time to do it. And we would also appreciate\r\nyour conveying our appreciation to the Dallas County Auditor for\r\nletting you take this time off. Will you do that, please?\r\n\r\nMr. FISCHER. Yes; and thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWIN EDWARDS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Robert Edwin Edwards was taken at 11 a.m., on April\r\n9, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Robert Edwin Edwards.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where do you live, Mr. Edwards?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Tahlequah, Okla.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you do up there?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I am going to school, college, Northeastern State College.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What year of school are you in? Are you a freshman?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No; I am a senior.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are a senior.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been going up to school there for several years?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Two years I went there. I laid out last year and worked\r\nhere in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you originally from Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No; Graham, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Graham High School in Graham, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got out of school?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I attended Abilene College.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For a year?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. One year.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Decatur Baptist College, which is a junior college.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Northeastern State College in Tahlequah, Okla.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Laid out last year?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; I am finishing up this semester.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do last fall?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I worked at the courthouse there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that the Dallas County Courthouse?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where is that located?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Let's say down on Main. I guess that would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What street crosses there, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Well, you mean--give me a multiple choice and I will tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Harwood?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Record?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about Elm? Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. It runs right behind it, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you working on the day the President came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That was November 22, 1963, I believe on a Friday, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have lunch before the motorcade came by or not?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you with anyone?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Ronald Fischer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Ronald Fischer. Did he work with you in that office?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were you doing there? By the way, what was your job?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Just a utility clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Came back and worked. I don't know exactly what time. For\r\na little while until it was time for the President to come by, and then\r\nwe left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go? You say you left. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. You mean left the office?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Down on--I get the streets mixed up. Let's see, it would\r\nbe Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; I guess it would be Houston across the street in the\r\nlittle park right across from the courthouse, straight across from,\r\nfacing the Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, let me ask you this now.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That is Elm, I guess that is what it is. I guess that is\r\nElm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you used the word \"Depository,\" what building do you\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That building is at the corner of Elm and Houston, isn't\r\nit? Houston comes this way?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, Houston, I believe, runs in a north-south direction.\r\nElm runs in a east-west direction. Would a map help you at all?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me see if I can get one for you here.\r\n\r\nI am handing you a portion of a map. You see Houston Street here on\r\nthis map?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And you see Elm Street running this way, and the arrow\r\npointing north, so Houston runs north and south.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Where do you put the courthouse?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The courthouse would be off this strip of map, but that is\r\nElm and here is Houston. This little black square would be the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. It would have to be Houston and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Here is Elm going in the parkway here. Do you see that right\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, Main Street would be running toward the bottom of\r\nthe map?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; it was here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are putting your finger at the point which would be to\r\nthe west of Houston Street and to the south of Elm as it goes into the\r\nparkway, is that right?\r\n\r\nYou see the arrow pointing northwest would be to your left on the map,\r\nand you are going to be west of Houston Street and south of Elm going\r\nin the parkway, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; I would be over here, right over here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Here is the parkway. Can you see it upside down here? Let's\r\nsee if I can show you a picture.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I am sorry. I don't have a picture.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Here is a map and on the map north is shown with an arrow.\r\nYou see it right here?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Edwards, have you now located yourself on this map?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, where were you located?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I guess I would plant myself right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are planting yourself now at a spot which would be on\r\nthe west side of Houston Street near that entrance of Elm Street into\r\nthe parkway there, and you would be facing in a northerly direction\r\ntoward the School Book Depository Building, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who were you standing with?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Ronald Fischer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What time did you get there?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long before the motorcade came by, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Where is that little paper and I will tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Can you remember without looking at any paper right now?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No; not really. I can guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your best guess? We will understand that it is just\r\na guess.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Maybe I'd better not guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, if you don't care to guess, that is fine. We\r\nwould prefer that you not make any statement unless you feel fairly\r\nsure about it.\r\n\r\nWhat did you do when you got to this point?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Stood there and waited for the motorcade to come.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look around at all?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever take a look at the south side of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building? That would be facing--you would be\r\nlooking at the south side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever look at that at all?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before the motorcade came by?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Nothing of importance except maybe one individual who was\r\nup there in the corner room of the sixth floor which was crowded in\r\namong boxes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What portion of the sixth floor as you looked at the\r\nbuilding to your right or to your left?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. To my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How near the corner?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. The corner window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The corner window there?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you describe this individual at all? Was he a white\r\nman or a Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. White man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Tall or short, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he have anything in his hand at all that you could see?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see his hands?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of clothes did he have on?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Light colored shirt, short sleeve and open neck.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How much of him could you see? Shoulder up, waist up, knees\r\nup, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. From the waist on. From the abdomen or stomach up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the man fat, thin, or average in size?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Oh, about average. Possibly thin.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you tell whether he was light skinned or medium skin\r\nor what, if you could tell?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the sun shining in or not, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the sun out that day?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What color hair did the man have?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Light brown.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Light brown hair?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That is what I would say; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any other people on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice whether or not there were any, or just did\r\nyou look and see any?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I notice that there--I just didn't see any.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the next floor above? Did you see any people on\r\nthe floor above?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about on any floors below? See any people on the fifth\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Fourth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Third floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Possibly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Second floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. First floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, you signed an affidavit for the sheriff's\r\ndepartment where you stated that you saw a man at the window on the\r\nfifth floor, and the window was wide open all the way, and there was a\r\nstack of books around him, I could see. And you just told me you didn't\r\nsee a man on the fifth floor. Was that affidavit correct or not?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That is incorrect. That has been straightened out since.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean it has been straightened out?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Well, they discussed it with me later and I took that\r\nback. That was the FBI. It was the sixth floor, though.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How do you know it was the sixth floor? Sixth floor rather\r\nthan the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I went with them and I showed them the window, and I\r\ndidn't count the bottom floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the first time when you made the affidavit you\r\ndidn't count the bottom floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you went out with the FBI, they asked you to point out\r\nthe window?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And you pointed out the same window you saw on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you weren't counting the bottom floor?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. They did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you watch them count?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember how many floors from the top it was?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I think seven in all, seven floors. It is next to the top.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not the hair of the man was short,\r\naverage, or long on the man that you saw in the window that day?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what conversation did you and Ronald Fischer have about\r\nthis man, if anything? Do you remember what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I made a statement to Ronny that I wondered who he was\r\nhiding from since he was up there crowded in among the boxes, in a\r\njoking manner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you said it in a joking manner?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did Fischer say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I don't recall what he said, but I know that we said a few\r\nthings. It wasn't of any importance at the time. And we looked up at\r\nhim, both of us.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you look at him?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Just a few seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what took your attention away, if any, or did you just\r\nstart looking somewhere else?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Started looking somewhere else.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long after that did the motorcade come by?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Thirty seconds or a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that you can remember that you or Ronald\r\nFischer said?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of that might be relevant at all?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Well, I heard one more then than was fired, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you said on the affidavit you heard four shots?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I still right now don't know how many was fired. If I said\r\nfour, then I thought I heard four.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If you said four, you mean the affidavit--maybe we'd better\r\nintroduce it into the record as Edward's Deposition Exhibit A. Where do\r\nyou think the shots came from?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I have no idea.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the affidavit you stated that the shots seemed to come\r\nfrom the building there. Did you really say that or not?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No; I didn't say that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I want to thank you for coming down here. You have an\r\nopportunity, if you want, to come back and read this deposition and\r\nsign it, or else you can waive the signing and reading of it and it\r\nwill be sent directly to Washington by the court reporter. It makes\r\nno difference to us. You can read and sign or can waive reading and\r\nsigning.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. I don't want to make an extra trip.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you want to waive it then?\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARDS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. JEAN LOLLIS HILL\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mrs. Jean Lollis Hill was taken at 2:30 p.m., on March\r\n24, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. May the record show that Mrs. Jean Lollis Hill is present\r\nat this moment in response to a letter request that she appear and\r\ngive a deposition to the President's Commission investigating the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMay I say for the record, Mrs. Hill, that the Commission is\r\ninvestigating all of the facts relating to the shooting and, and we\r\nhave asked you to appear here today to tell us what you know, if\r\nanything, relating to the actual assassination, because we understand\r\nyou were on the scene or nearby at that time.\r\n\r\nMay the record further reflect that Mrs. Hill was sent a letter under\r\ndate of March 18, 1964. With that preliminary statement, I will ask\r\nyou, Mrs. Hill, to stand and raise your right hand, if you will please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give before the\r\nPresident's Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Will you be seated, please, Mrs. Hill? And would you state\r\nyour full name for the record?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Jean Lollis Hill.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Mrs. Hill, have you received a letter request?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes, sir; I have.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Under date of March 18, 1964?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I have it here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, when did you see that letter request?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I guess I got it 2 or 3 days afterward--March 18--so I\r\nmust have gotten it Monday--no; I couldn't have gotten it yesterday--I\r\ngot it Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That would have been March 21?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. May the record show that a court reporter is\r\npresent and is taking verbatim transcript of the deposition of Mrs.\r\nHill, with the court reporter, Mrs. Hill, and myself being present, and\r\nthat all of the report is being transcribed and has been transcribed\r\nfrom the time Mrs. Hill arrived, is that correct, Mrs. Hill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were you on the day of November 22, 1963, at about\r\nnoontime?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I was standing directly across from the Texas School\r\nDepository Building on a grassy slope and the triangle toward the\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And that would have been Dealey Plaza?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. If that's what the name of it is.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would that be on the----\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. It was to the left of the motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To the left of the motorcade as the motorcade proceeded\r\nforward?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, you would have been on the south side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, what had you done immediately before noontime, Mrs.\r\nHill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. We had been there for about an hour and a half and had been\r\nwalking up and down and back and forth.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When you say \"we\" whom do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. My friend, Mary Moorman, that took the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. She had a camera with her?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; a Polaroid. We had been taking pictures all morning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have a camera with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And tell me what you observed as the President's motorcade\r\npassed by?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. You mean----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Start any place that you find most convenient and just\r\ntell me in your own way what happened.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as they came toward us, we had been taking pictures\r\nwith this Polaroid camera and since it was a Polaroid we knew we had\r\nonly one chance to get a picture, and at the time she had taken a\r\npicture just a few minutes before and I had grabbed it out of the\r\ncamera and wrapped it and put it in my pocket. Just about that time he\r\ndrew even with us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when you say \"he\" you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The President's car. We were standing on the curb and I\r\njumped to the edge of the street and yelled, \"Hey, we want to take\r\nyour picture,\" to him and he was looking down in the seat--he and\r\nMrs. Kennedy and their heads were turned toward the middle of the car\r\nlooking down at something in the seat, which later turned out to be the\r\nroses, and I was so afraid he was going to look the other way because\r\nthere were a lot of people across the street and we were, as far as I\r\nknow, we were the only people down there in that area, and just as I\r\nyelled, \"Hey,\" to him, he started to bring his head up to look at me\r\nand just as he did the shot rang out. Mary took the picture and fell on\r\nthe ground and of course there were more shots.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many shots were there altogether?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I have always said there were some four to six shots. There\r\nwere three shots--one right after the other, and a distinct pause, or\r\njust a moment's pause, and then I heard more.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How long a time elapsed from the first to the third of\r\nwhat you described as the first three shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. They were rapidly--they were rather rapidly fired.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you give me an estimate on the timespan on those\r\nthree shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I don't think I can.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, how many shots followed what you described as the\r\nfirst three shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I think there were at least four or five shots and perhaps\r\nsix, but I know there were more than three.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, much time elapsed from the very first shot until the\r\nvery last shot, will you estimate?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I don't think I could, properly, but my girl friend fell on\r\nthe ground after about--during the shooting--right, I would say, just\r\nimmediately after she had taken the picture--probably about the third\r\nshot. She fell on the ground and grabbed my slacks and said, \"Get down,\r\nthey're shooting.\" And, I knew they were but I was too stunned to move,\r\nso I didn't get down. I just stood there and gawked around.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can't you give me any better idea on the sequence of the\r\nshots other than to say that there were three shots right in a row and\r\nthen a moment's pause and an additional shot or shots.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. In what way?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any way you could be more specific by way of time\r\nlapses among any of the shots, from the first to the second shot, the\r\nsecond to the third, or in that manner?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The three were fired as though one person were firing; I\r\nmean, to me. They were fired just like you could reload and fire again\r\nor whatever you do with a gun.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With what sort of an action?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I think that the firing that was done could have been done\r\nwith the type gun that they say the assassinator used.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what type gun was that, according to your\r\nunderstanding?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. A bolt action.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about the shots that followed the three shots,\r\nthen, what would the sequence of timing have been on those?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I thought they were different--I thought the sequence was\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How will you describe the sequence?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Quicker--more automatic.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were there as few as four, as you recollected?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I won't say positively, I think I can still seemingly hear\r\nit, and I would still say there were more, you know, I'm saying 4 to 6.\r\nI know there were at least 4, and I just almost swear that I heard 5 or\r\n6.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could there have been more than 6 that you heard?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I couldn't say that I heard more than that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you say for certain that you did not hear more than\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I didn't hear any more than that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was the position of the President, as best you\r\nrecollect it, at the time the first shot was heard by you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He was slightly turned, he was sitting back in the seat,\r\nlike turned toward Mrs. Kennedy and his head was down, and his hands\r\nwere like this (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. His hands were in his lap?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No--not really.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How would you describe the position of his hands?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He was sitting here [indicating] and Mrs. Kennedy--he was\r\nlike this [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You are indicating the right hand on the left knee?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. With the body turned slightly toward the person on his\r\nleft?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who would have been Mrs. Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And were you watching him at this time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes, I was looking right at his face.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what reaction, if any, did he have at the time of the\r\nfirst shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. As I said, I had yelled at him and he had started to raise\r\nhis head up and I saw his head start to come up and all at once a\r\nbullet rang out and he slumped forward like this [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Lurched or slumped, as you say, to the left?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did his head drop down?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; he was just, you know, slumping down like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have a chance to see anything of Governor Connally\r\nat that exact second?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. There was a scrambling around in the front seat. I didn't\r\nknow who was riding with him, I hadn't paid any attention to who was\r\nriding with him in the car, but I never did see Mrs. Connally. I guess\r\nmy story is probably colored by what I have heard.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell me what you have heard that you think maybe that\r\ncolored your story?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. About what the Connallys say about the shots, which shots\r\nhit where and everything.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What is that that you have heard?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I have heard that 1 shot hit Kennedy and also hit\r\nConnally, that the same shot that hit Kennedy hit Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did you hear that, Mrs. Hill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else have you heard?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. And also that Mrs. Connally jumped up and covered Mr.\r\nConnally with her body and pushed him to the floor, but I never did see\r\nMrs. Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever see Governor Connally?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I did see him; I didn't know who he was, but I did see\r\nhim and I knew that someone had been hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was he pushed in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I just vaguely know that he was toward the front.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, was he in the front seat of the ear or was he\r\nbetween President Kennedy and the front seat of the car, or where was\r\nhe?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Between President Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You know that there were jump seats in the car so that\r\nthere would have been people sitting three positions forward, one in\r\nthe back seat--President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy, on the right in the\r\njump seat--Governor Connally and Mrs. Connally and in the front seat,\r\ntwo Secret Service agents--people sitting three positions forward?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I saw the Secret Service agents.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you been, prior to the time I told you just now,\r\nfamiliar with that arrangement of the personnel in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I knew that, and as I said, I didn't know who the\r\npeople were in the car because I am new here--I don't know the\r\nConnallys, I just knew that people were in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice the person sitting in the jump seat on\r\nthe right-hand side, that would be the person immediately in front of\r\nPresident Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I would say it was Mr. Connally.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe him at any specific time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I saw a man fall to the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And when, in point of time, did you see him fall?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. After the President was shot, but I wouldn't--it wasn't with\r\nthe first shot. To me he wasn't hit when the first shot hit.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is the basis for your saying that, Mrs. Hill?\r\n\r\nMrs.. HILL. Well, I just think that he was hit after Kennedy was hit\r\nbecause, well, just the way that it looked, I would say that he was hit\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, do you associate the time that Governor Connally\r\nappeared to have been hit with any specific shot that you heard?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The second.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what specifically did you observe at the time of the\r\nsecond shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, that's what I thought had happened--that they had hit\r\nsomeone in the front part of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you observe at the time of the third shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. President Kennedy was hit again and he had further buffeted\r\nhis body and I didn't realize at the time what it was--I remarked to\r\nmy friends in the police station that day--did she notice his hair\r\nstanding up, because it did. It just rippled up like this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And at what time was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. On the third shot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you notice Governor Connally at the time of the third\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I never saw him again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What occurred at the time of the fourth shot which you\r\nbelieve you heard?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, at that time, of course, there was a pause and I took\r\nthe other shots--about that time Mary grabbed me and was yelling and\r\nI had looked away from what was going on here and I thought, because\r\nI guess from the TV and movies, that it was Secret Service agents\r\nshooting back. To me, if somebody shoots at somebody they always shoot\r\nback and so I just thought that that's what it was and I thought, well,\r\nthey are getting him and shooting back, you know; I didn't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was the President's car at the time you thought you\r\nheard the fourth shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The motorcade came to almost a halt at the time the shots\r\nrang out, and I would say it was just approximately, if not--it\r\ncouldn't have been in the same position, I'm sure it wasn't, but just\r\na very, very short distance from where it had been. It was just almost\r\nstunned.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how about the time of the fifth shot, where do you\r\nthink the President's car was?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That was during those shots, I think it wasn't any further\r\nthan a few feet--further down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Which shots, now--you mean the fourth, and perhaps the\r\nfifth and perhaps the sixth shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Are you able to say what anyone was doing or what events\r\nwere occurring at the time of the fourth through perhaps the sixth\r\nshots which you have testified about?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as I said, at that time she was yelling at me and on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was yelling at you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Mary, my friend, was yelling at me and she was down on the\r\nground and I looked up and I could see everyone was just stunned, there\r\nwas immobility all around and I just stood there looking around and\r\nI'm sure there wasn't a pause--it seemed like an eternity but I'm sure\r\nthere was just a slight pause before things started moving again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were the shots over by that time when things started\r\nmoving again?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then what happened on the scene?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, they say Mrs. Kennedy climbed up on the back of the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you observe that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I have seen pictures that show that she must have, but I\r\nran across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. To the----\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Other side.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. North side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right. I saw a man up there running, or getting away\r\nor walking away or something--I would say he was running.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that man when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He was right up there by the School Depository, just--not at\r\nthe corner where they say the shots came from, at the other end, right\r\nup on the slope at the top of the slope.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would that be in front of the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. At the west end?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. More to the west end.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would it be between the westernmost point of the building\r\nand some other point in the building? Was he at the westernmost point\r\nor farther east than the westernmost point?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I would say he was farther east than the westernmost point.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw a diagram for me in rough outline, starting\r\nwith Houston Street----\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; but I can't do this very well.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Permit me to draw an outline, then, to get your bearing\r\nhere and realizing that I want your recollection, and I'll ask you the\r\nquestions. Assume that Houston Street is the street which I am marking\r\nHouston. Assume that this is Main Street. Assume that Elm Street curves\r\ndown in the manner that I am drawing and marking.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Assume that the Texas School Book Depository is this large\r\nbuilding which I will mark \"TSBD.\" Now, would you place with the letter\r\n\"A\" where you were at the time the President went by?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I would have to place the President first.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine--place him with the letter \"X\".\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. All right--if he were here----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, was he in the center of the street or on the side of\r\nthe street?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He was on the side--he wasn't just completely over there,\r\nbut he was past the center of the street and we were----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, place yourself with the letter \"A\".\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Right there [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Make it a big printed \"A\" for us.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Okay. [Complied with request of counsel Specter.]\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, would you place the position you ran to after the\r\nPresident's car went by?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. By that time, I'm sure the car was here--it was on down a\r\nlittle way, and I ran behind here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Draw a line to where you ran.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. All right--I don't know whether I've got this just\r\nright--but I ran approximately right up through here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Put a \"B\" here where you were when you came to a stop on\r\nthe other side of the street.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. These steps.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, where were you when you first noticed the----\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. These steps that go up--I guess you've looked at the site,\r\nthere are some steps down there that go up to that promenade, or\r\nwhatever you call it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That go in a generally westerly direction?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Beyond the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and I was just on this side----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. \"This side\"--you are meaning--the east of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The east of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you beyond the westernmost point of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were still in front of that building?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is the letter \"B\" now in the position where you were\r\nwhen you first saw that man?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where was that man, indicating with the letter \"C,\" where\r\nhe was? He was very close to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, he was at the top of this hill--you don't leave me any\r\nspace in here--I mean, there's a distance in here greater than what is\r\nshown here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He was between Elm Street and the Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where did you see him going?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I saw him go toward the tracks, toward the railroad tracks\r\nto the west?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you observe about that man, if anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That he just had on a brown overcoat and a hat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why was your attention attracted to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Because he was the only thing moving up there. The other\r\npeople were all grief stricken and standing there and I don't know what\r\nI would have done with him when I got up there, but I don't know why I\r\neven had the instinct to run, and I don't know that it is anything even\r\nconnected with this, but since I had already--I have told it and it is\r\npart of my recollection, I am just stating it again.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, was there anything about the man that attracted your\r\nattention to him beside the fact that he was moving?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I just thought at the time--that's the man that did it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you think that this was the man that did it?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I just don't know--I mean--that was my thought.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see any weapon in his hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I never saw a weapon during the whole time, in anyone's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see that man from the front?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. As well as I remember, now, when I saw him he was turning\r\nand going to the west.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he in the process of turning when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I would say he was turning.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So that you had some view of his front part of his body?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you see any weapon at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No, sir; he was three-fourths turned by the time I did see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see both of his hands at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Could you see one of his hands at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I do not even remember seeing his hands.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I mean, if he was turning, his hands would have been\r\nvisible, wouldn't they?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. They surely would have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, what you are saying is, you don't have any\r\nrecollection of seeing his hands?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I have no recollection--that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But from the position of his body, his hands would have\r\nbeen in the position where they could have been observed?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right--surely.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And do you have any recollection of observing any weapon\r\nin either hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I never saw a weapon the whole time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Had you moved from point \"A\" at the time you first saw\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's the reason I ran across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see him while you were at point \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Do you mean prior to the shots? Yes; I saw him, that's the\r\nreason why I went across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, you saw him when you were at point \"A\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right--that's the reason I left that spot.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And he was at point \"C\" when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he move before you moved?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. His moving made me start after him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. So, he did move before you moved?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and as I came across the street--as I said--I never\r\ndid see Mrs. Kennedy get up or anything, because when I ran across the\r\nstreet, the first motorcycle that was right behind her nearly hit me\r\nturning around, because I looked up in his face and he was looking all\r\naround.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean the policeman?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and I don't think he ever did see me. I just looked at\r\nhim and dodged then because I thought his wheel was going to hit me,\r\nand I don't think he ever did see me, and I ran across through there\r\nand started up the hill. When I looked down on the ground, I mean, as I\r\nwas running up the hill to catch that man, I looked down and saw some\r\nred stuff and I thought, \"Oh, they got him, he's bleeding,\" and this is\r\nembarrassing, but it turned out to be Koolade or some sort of red drink.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You thought they had gotten the man who was running away?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You thought that perhaps the second burst of shots you\r\nheard were being directed toward him by the Secret Service?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I just thought, \"Oh, goodness, the Secret Service is\r\nshooting back.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe what that man looked like?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He wasn't----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How tall was he?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He wasn't very tall.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he more than 5 feet tall, or can you give me any\r\nmeaningful description of him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, yes; but I don't want to.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why is that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, because I had told several people and I also said it\r\nthat day down there and the person that I described, and I am fully\r\naware that his whereabouts have been known at all times, and that it\r\nseems that I am merely using a figure and converting it to my story,\r\nbut the person that I saw looked a lot like--I would say the general\r\nbuild as I would think Jack Ruby would from that position. But I have\r\ntalked with the FBI about this and I told them I realized that his\r\nwhereabouts had been covered at all times and of course I didn't--at\r\nthat time I didn't realize that the shots were coming from the\r\nbuilding. I frankly thought they were coming from the knoll.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you think they were coming from the knoll?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That was just my idea where they were coming from.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Would you draw the knoll on the picture, where you mean by\r\nthe knoll?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. This area in front of the Book Depository--it's right here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Just draw me a circle as to where you had a general\r\nimpression the shots were coming from.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. This is a hill and it was like they were coming from right\r\nin there. That's when I looked up and saw that man and all the rest\r\nof the people were stunned and not moving in that area and yet he was\r\ngetting out of there--I thought that probably he had done it, and so I\r\nwent to catch him, for some reason.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you have a conscious impression of the source of\r\nthe first shot that you heard, that is, where it came from?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, evidently I didn't because the only conscious\r\nrecollection I have of that--I mean--until all this other came out--I\r\nhad always thought that they came from the knoll.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you have any conscious impression of where the second\r\nshot came from?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any conscious impression of where this third shot came\r\nfrom?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Not any different from any of them. I thought it was just\r\npeople shooting from the knoll--I did think there was more than one\r\nperson shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You did think there was more than one person shooting?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What made you think that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The way the gun report sounded and the difference in the way\r\nthey were fired--the timing.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What was your impression as to the source of the second\r\ngroup of shots which you have described as the fourth, perhaps the\r\nfifth, and perhaps the sixth shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, nothing, except that I thought that they were fired by\r\nsomeone else.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you have any idea where they were coming from?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; as I said, I thought they were coming from the general\r\ndirection of that knoll.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, did you think that the Secret Service was firing\r\nthem from that knoll?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I said I didn't know--I really don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You just had the general impression that shots were coming\r\nfrom the knoll?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you had the general impression that the Secret Service\r\nwas firing the second group of shots at the man who fired the first\r\ngroup of shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But you had no specific impression as to the source of\r\nthose shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you get a very good look at that man, who you say was\r\nstarting to run?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as I said, when I looked down at this red stuff on\r\nthe ground, I said, \"Oh,\" you know, to myself, \"they hit him.\" You\r\nknow, I was going to follow that, and when I looked up again, I looked\r\nall around and I couldn't see him anywhere and I kept running toward\r\nthe train tracks and I looked all around out there and I couldn't\r\nsee him--I looked everywhere and I heard someone yelling something\r\nabout--it was just this voice that was yelling, \"It looks like he got\r\naway,\" or something--I thought I had been right, you know, that he had\r\nreally gone up there and he had gotten away some way in the tracks or\r\nhad gone around behind the Depository, and so, I didn't know where he\r\nhad gone. By that time I saw policemen--where he had gone. By that time\r\nI saw policemen--some were coming off of their motorcycles just around\r\nthe curb here--just at the underpass here, and of course, the motorcade\r\nsped away and the policemen were coming from all sorts of different\r\ndirections, people were closing in, and all I could think of was, \"I\r\nwant to get out of here fast. I don't want to be caught by anybody.\r\nI don't want to be in on anything,\" and everytime anybody would come\r\ntoward me I would go another way until I got off of that hill back up\r\nthere where the tracks were.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you run up toward the hill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I ran up toward the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Let me draw the triple underpass there, and you ran up to\r\nwhat point--where? About the point of \"D\" here?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Why did you run up there--after the man?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I was still looking for him. I didn't know where he had\r\ngone. I heard lots of people yelling, \"Did he get away, did he get\r\naway, and which way did he go.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were trying to catch him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But you couldn't find him any more?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I just couldn't find him again. When I stopped to look\r\ndown at the grass, at this red stuff and when I looked back up, by that\r\ntime everyone was screaming and moving around.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where were you when you looked down at the ground?\r\nPoint it out to me on the diagram.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The steps that go up to this colonnade thing right there and\r\nI saw it right about here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, mark it with the letter \"E\" there.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, a moment ago you said you didn't want to say anything\r\nmore about the identity of the man. Why did you tell me that, Mrs. Hill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, because I have had an awful lot of fun made of me over\r\nbeing a witness in this and I'm real tired of it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who made fun of you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, quite a lot of people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Anybody connected with the official investigation in the\r\ncase?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No, oh, no; it was just people, but people that I know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, and why have they made fun of you, because of\r\nyour identification of who that man was?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Any other reason?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes--I saw a dog in the car. They kept asking me, and I even\r\ngave that out on a radio or TV interview that I had seen a dog in the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In which car?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Between the President and Mrs. Kennedy, and they kept asking\r\nme what kind of a dog and I said, \"I don't know, I wasn't interested\r\nin what was in the seat,\" but I said, \"It was white and fuzzy,\" and I\r\nsaid, \"It was something white and kind of fuzzy and it was in the seat\r\nbetween them,\" and I said, \"I just got to thinking--it must be a small\r\ndog,\" because I had remarked to my girl friend as they were taking us\r\nin the police station, I said, \"Why?\" I said, \"I could see Liz Taylor\r\nor the Gabors traveling with a bunch of dogs, but I can't see the\r\nKennedys traveling with dogs. Why would they have a dog with them on\r\ntour?\" And, when we remarked about that she and I both--and I said,\r\n\"Did you see it? What kind of a dog was it? Why were they taking a\r\ndog?\" I found out later that it was those roses in the seat, but I knew\r\nthey were looking at something and I just barely glanced and I saw this.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there any other reason people made fun of you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, basically, the people that made fun of me was my\r\nhusband, and, of course, that was because--does this have to go in the\r\nrecord?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Yes; only in the sense that we are putting everything\r\non the record. This really isn't too important but it is the best\r\nprocedure to follow, that everything be written down.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. In a situation of this sort.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, because I talked with an Oklahoma twang, and called\r\nMrs. Kennedy \"Jackie\" and I said, \"He pitched forward in Jackie's lap,\"\r\nand I just didn't rehearse it and do it right at all, because I didn't\r\nknow it was going to be taken down.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And those are the reasons your husband made fun of you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and because I saw a dog and he was thoroughly hilarious\r\nwhen he found out that it was roses in the back seat and that I had\r\nseen a dog, and he said, \"Of all people in the United States you would\r\nhave to see a dog.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Has anybody made fun of you besides your husband?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; not really, but he's done enough for a whole bunch of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, going back to the question of the description of this\r\nman, can you describe him in any more detail than you already have?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I haven't--I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. His height you said was about the height of Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about his weight?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's the only thing--I would say--he certainly wasn't any\r\nbigger than Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he smaller than Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He could have been smaller.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How about--was he wearing a hat?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I said he was wearing a hat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he wearing a top coat?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; an overcoat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And was he wearing a tie, could you tell?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I didn't notice. It was a brown, I mean, I just got the\r\nimpression of a brown hat.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you give me an estimate of his age?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I would say the man was middle aged, or say, I would say 40.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was he a white man or a Negro?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He was a white man.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Can you describe him in any other way to me?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think he was, in fact, Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you told me all that you can recollect about\r\nthis man and your reason for moving toward him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you were at point \"D,\" what did you do after being at\r\npoint \"D,\" which we have marked on the diagram?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as I said, the policemen were coming by that time from\r\ndifferent areas, coming and closing this place off, and I was dodging\r\nthem, trying to get back across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Back across Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And did you in fact dodge them?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And get back across Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what, if anything, did you do next?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. There was a man holding Mary's arm and she was crying and he\r\nhad hold of her camera trying to take it with him.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Featherstone of the Times Herald, and----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Dallas Times Herald?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right. I ran up there and told him we had to leave.\r\nShe had been impressing upon me for an hour and a half--we hadn't even\r\ngone down to see the President that day--we had been doing other things\r\nand we got down there and we just decided we would stay, but she had\r\nbeen impressing upon me for an hour and a half, the whole time we had\r\nbeen there, that we had to beat the traffic out of there, and she knows\r\nher way around real well, so I knew she could get out and we could beat\r\nthe traffic, and we were just going to run for the car as fast as we\r\ncould. It was parked up here on Houston. We were going to run and get\r\nout of there before the people started milling around so we wouldn't be\r\nin that traffic, and I don't know--we had been talking about it so long\r\nand she had drilled me so much, that we must get out of here, and when\r\nI came back and I found her crying and him standing there holding her\r\ncamera, and holding her, I mean holding her by the arm and her camera,\r\nand telling her she had to go with him, I started trying to shake his\r\nhand loose and grab the camera and telling him that \"No, we wouldn't\r\ngo, we had to leave,\" and I guess by that time I was beginning--until\r\nthen I have no conscious feeling of any scaredness or excitement or\r\nanything. I mean, you know, it is just like something that's passing in\r\nfront of you, and I mean, I wasn't worried or upset in any way until\r\nI got back there and then I had a sense of urgency. I just knew I\r\nwanted to get out of there and all I could think of--and I don't think\r\nthe full impact of all that had happened really hit me then, because\r\nI was just wanting to get out of there and to get away and he kept\r\ntelling me--he insisted we go with him and he just practically ran us,\r\nand he got--they were throwing up a police net around that building\r\nat the time, and he just practically ran us up to the court house, I\r\nguess it is, and put us in this little room and I don't know why we\r\nwere so dumb that day unless it was just the sequence of events, that\r\neverything was just happening so fast we really didn't even think, but\r\nwe couldn't leave. He kept standing in front of the door and he would\r\nlet a cameraman in or someone to interview us and they were shooting\r\nthings in our faces, and he wouldn't let us out.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who was interviewing you--newspaper reporters?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Newspaper reporters and radio and TV people and a man\r\nfrom--a man named Coker John, or John Coker.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. From where?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. As I get it, he is a sort of freelance writer, and I think\r\nhe was on an assignment then. He came out--I'm not sure--I thought it\r\nwas for Life or Post, but he came in there and he was shooting pictures\r\nfor--I think he was shooting them for TV, but he came out to the house\r\nabout 2 weeks later with this bunch of men, about four of them, three\r\nor four came out, and that's the second time I saw him, because he\r\nsaid, \"You remember me, I saw you in the pressroom that day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is that Miss Hill or Mrs. Hill?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. It is Mrs. Hill, and he said \"I saw you in the pressroom\r\nthat day,\" and I said, \"Yes.\" I remembered him because I saw him more\r\nthan any--now, I don't remember where I am here.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You were telling me about what happened to you at the\r\ncounty courthouse, and then you digressed from that to tell me about\r\nJohn coming to see you in your home.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the county courthouse and let me ask you if you gave\r\nan affidavit to the sheriff that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did you talk to anybody from the Federal Government\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Whom did you talk to?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What agency was the man from, if you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many times have you talked to somebody from the Secret\r\nService in this case altogether?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I would say the only time I talked to the Secret Service men\r\nwas when I was down at the courthouse that afternoon, just before they\r\nlet us leave, and I think--now, we officially sat down and supposedly\r\nwere giving a story to the Secret Service men.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And, did they write down what you were telling them?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I don't think they did.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you sign anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Oh, well, I signed my statement that I made over in the\r\nsheriff's office.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Then, how about for the Secret Service men, did you sign\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No, I don't think we signed anything over there, because\r\nthey just took us in a little room----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell the Secret Service men?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. As well as I remember, we talked to so many that day.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, did you tell everybody about the same thing you have\r\ntold me here today?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes, except that I didn't go into that stuff with the shots\r\nbecause no one ever asked me, no one ever detailed it like that, but\r\nthey were interested that day in those pictures and they got them all\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you talk with the Secret Service men on any occasion\r\nafter the events on November 22?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you ever talked to anybody else from the Federal\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. The FBI men.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Several.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. How many, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I don't recall--I was called two or three times at least\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Called on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You discussed the matter over the phone with somebody who\r\nsaid he was from the FBI?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I had that pulled on me and I didn't want to talk until\r\nI called back down to check to see.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you talk to somebody from the FBI when you called them\r\nback?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Over the phone?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I think two or three times is all I had.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Were you ever interviewed in person by the FBI?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On how many occasions?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. After that day, I believe only once.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And about when was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, it was the other day after I received this letter--no;\r\nbefore I received this letter, and this was last Tuesday, I think, and\r\nthey came in reference to what Mark Lane had told the Warren Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did they ask you when they came to see you last\r\nTuesday, that would be a week ago today or the 16th--or the 17th?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. They just had me start over with this story again and they\r\nhad Mr. Lane's copy and they asked me, you know, if I had said these\r\nthings and, I read it and told them that I had said it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was Mr. Lane's version accurate?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. It was accurate in that he took down what I said. It was\r\ninaccurate in that he had taken it out of context, and the questions\r\nhe asked me weren't there, nor were they given. I can see how he could\r\nhave made what he made out of my statements.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. When did you talk to Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I talked to him about--approximately 4 or 6 weeks ago.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where did that take place?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. At New York.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he call you on the telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right, and he didn't tell me he was recording this at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever talk to Mark Lane in person?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you ever sign an affidavit for him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. The only contact you had with him was this one telephone\r\nconversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right, and he said he was coming to Dallas the next\r\nweek and would I talk with him, I said, I told him then--that I guessed\r\nso. I didn't know. I mean, because I didn't fully realize what he was\r\ndoing in this case.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what did you tell him over the telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I told him the same story I told you, with the exception\r\nthat he went further into the day's activities at the police station,\r\nand at the courthouse.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else did you tell him about your day's activities at\r\nthe courthouse?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, he asked me, you know, he just asked me a lot of\r\nquestions about that, and I told him that we didn't know that we were\r\nin a pressroom. We just knew we were in a courthouse and with police. I\r\nmean, this was to us a police station.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Tell me all the things that you told him, in addition to\r\nthose which you have already told me, that is, tell me all the things\r\nyou told Mr. Lane, in addition to that you have already testified about.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I will, but do you realize I have had to go over this so\r\nmany times that I don't know who I have told which part to? I really\r\ndon't.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, I'll bear that in mind, but do the best you can in\r\ntelling me all the things you told Mark Lane.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Can't you just read my statement?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Feel free to smoke--just relax.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I would except, I don't have one.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Just relax if you can.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. All right, if I can.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Off the record.\r\n\r\nLet the record show that we were taking a brief recess to get the\r\nwitness a cup of coffee so that she may be more relaxed. May the record\r\nshow that we have just obtained some coffee and we are proceeding.\r\n\r\nWhen we broke for the coffee, I had asked you to tell me all the things\r\nyou told Mark Lane other than those which you have already testified\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Before we go into that--I do want to have you--because I\r\nhope that by this time I am through with it, but I do want to tell you\r\nabout a camera team that came out there to my house that this John\r\nCoker was with.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. On which occasion was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That is important to me and that is the reason why I\r\ndigressed and got on that.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. This occurred, you say, about 2 weeks after the\r\nassassination?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Say--10 days.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What happened on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. They came out and brought TV cameras and were going to take,\r\nand they told me they were not going to tell me the questions that they\r\nwere going to ask me, that they wanted to get my reactions to their\r\nquestions, and they set up rather, I would say they set up hypothetical\r\nsituations like--could he have been shot from the window, if this is\r\nthe kind of wound that it would have made? Or, to make this kind of a\r\nwound, he had to have been here, now which, you know--and so I told\r\nthem and from what I gathered that day, they did not think I had--I\r\nhad gotten the idea from them, that there was speculation or some\r\nreasonable doubt that I--that Oswald did not do all the shooting and\r\nthat all these shots did not come from the window.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You told the newspaper and the television cameramen that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's what I got from them from the questions they asked me.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What answers did you give them to those questions?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, when they would set up a situation, I would tell them\r\nwhat I thought would have had to happen in that situation.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, without formulating any questions which would\r\nlead you in any way to any conclusions, let me ask you for your best\r\nrecollection as to what you think occurred, as to the point where the\r\nassassin was, if you have any idea on that question?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as I said previously, to me at the time the shot came\r\nfrom the knoll, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And you have testified to that because of the sound of the\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And also because you saw this man running away.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you think perhaps that you had the impression that that\r\ncame from the knoll exclusively because you saw the man running away?\r\nAnd your reaction that that must have been the man who did the shooting?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. It could have been very well--it could have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, are there any other factors which led you to think\r\nthat the shots came from the knoll, factors other than those you have\r\nalready told me about?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Except that I believe these men thought so that night.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, never mind the men, but focus just on what your\r\nreaction was at the time.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's what I thought. At the time I thought that there was\r\nmore than one person shooting, as I said before.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, you have already told me about that and you told me\r\nabout the source of the knoll, and you told me why you thought that\r\nwas more than one person, and now, what I'm trying to get at is why\r\nyou thought they came from the knoll--was it first because the way the\r\nshot sounded and secondly, because the man ran away, and then I asked\r\nyou the second question--did you think perhaps they came from the knoll\r\nexclusively because you saw the man run away, and you said you thought\r\nthat might be the case.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Could be.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And then I asked you were there any other findings\r\nother than those we have already talked about, which would make you\r\nthink that the shots came from the knoll, based on your own personal\r\nobservations, recollections or impressions.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Nothing that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is there anything else about that television\r\ninterview which you consider important?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Except for the fact it left me very doubtful and confused.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Because they gave you a lot of hypothetical situations,\r\nand you didn't know which was which, if you listened to them?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right--they had some very strange ideas which I have\r\nheard here and there voiced by other people.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were they doing basically, asking you to comment on\r\nthose various theories?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I asked why were they coming out here, why would they come\r\nto my home, why was that important, and they said, \"Something big is\r\ngoing to break in a little while and we want to put it on first. We\r\nwant to be ready for it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did they ever put that television interview on?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I have never seen any, but then, I never saw myself on TV\r\neither.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Is there anything else about that television interview\r\nwhich you now consider important?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I know that it has bothered me ever since it happened,\r\nand particularly since I have been questioned these other times.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. By the FBI last week?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and without things of comments, and speculation that\r\nI have heard, and remarks that I've gone back over, of happenings\r\nthat have happened to me that day and as to the way it happened, and\r\nfrankly, I would either like to say it again or something----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Like to say what again?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I would like to see this telecast or hear that questioning\r\nagain because there's something about it that keeps in the back of my\r\nmind----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But you can't put your finger on what it is?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. But you are annoyed or bothered or perplexed with it or\r\nconfused by that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; I have been.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you told me everything that you have to say\r\nabout that television interview?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, moving on to the question about Mark Lane, what did\r\nyou tell him other than that which you have told me here today?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He asked me where we were taken and I told him in the\r\npressroom, that we didn't know it was the pressroom at the time, and\r\nthat we didn't know we couldn't leave and because they kept standing\r\nacross the door, and the first time we really--we were getting tired of\r\nit, I mean, we had been down there quite a while and we were getting\r\ntired of it and we wanted to leave and this is what I told him, and\r\nso some man came in and offered Mary a sum, I think--say--$10,000 or\r\nsomething like this for this picture.\r\n\r\nWe realized that--they said, \"Don't sell the picture.\" He was a\r\nrepresentative of either Post or Life, and they said, \"Don't sell\r\nthat picture until our representatives have contacted you or a\r\nlawyer or something.\" Anyway, we realized at that time we didn't\r\nhave that picture, that it had been taken from us. I mean, we had\r\nlet Featherstone look at it, you know, but we told no one they could\r\nreproduce it. They said, \"Would you let us look at it and see if it\r\ncould be reproduced?\" We said, \"Yes; you could look at it,\" we thought\r\nit was--you know, it was fuzzy and everything, but we were wanting to\r\nkeep them and we suddenly realized we didn't have that picture, and\r\nthat was quite a bit of money and we were getting pretty excited about\r\nit, and Mary was getting scared----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did she eventually sell the picture, by the way?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. She sold the rights, the publishing rights of it, not the\r\noriginal picture, but they had already--AP and UP had already picked it\r\nup because Featherstone stole it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know what she sold those rights for?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I think it was $600.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What did you tell Mark Lane besides about the picture?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. This is it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Fine, go ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Anyway, when I realized we didn't have that picture and\r\nMary was getting upset about that--by that time I had realized we\r\nwere in a pressroom and that he had no right to be holding us and he\r\nhad no authority and that we could get out of there, and they kept\r\nstanding in front of the door, and I told him--I said, \"Get out.\" We\r\nkept asking him for our picture, and where it was, and he said, \"We'll\r\nget it back--we'll get it back. And so I jerked away and ran out of\r\nthe door and as I did, there was a Secret Service man. Now, this I was\r\ntold--that he was a Secret Service man, and he said, \"Do you have a red\r\nraincoat?\" And, I said, \"Yes; it's in yonder. Let me go.\" I was intent\r\non finding someone to get that picture back and I said as I walked out,\r\n\"I can get someone big enough to get it back for us.\" He said, \"Does\r\nyour friend have a blue raincoat?\" And I said, \"Yes; she's in there.\"\r\nHe said, \"Here they are,\" to somebody else and they told us that they\r\nhad been looking for us.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who told you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. This man.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All this you told Mr. Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. And so, then they took us into the police station. Just\r\nabout that time Sheriff Decker came out and the man was with us and\r\nwe were telling him why we were in there, why we had been in the\r\npressroom, you know, and why they hadn't been able to find us, because\r\nthey had thought that Mary had been hit and they were looking for the\r\ntwo women that were standing right by the car with the camera. At that\r\ntime they didn't know what we were doing down there and why we were\r\nright at the car. So, there followed questioning all afternoon long,\r\nand he asked me at one time--well, in fact he asked repeatedly if I was\r\nheld and I told him, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who asked you that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Mark Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. If you were held?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; you know if I were held, if I had to stay there and I\r\ntold him, \"Yes,\" but I told him when we were in the pressroom it was\r\njust our own ignorance, really, that was keeping us there and letting\r\nthe man intimidate us that had no authority.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. That was a newsman as opposed to the police official?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; and I gave Mark Lane his name several times--clearly. I\r\nremember clearly that I gave him his name.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what name did you give him?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Featherstone of the Times Herald, and so after we got out of\r\nthere and I talked with a man----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, you are continuing to tell me everything you told\r\nMark Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right, and I talked with this man, a Secret Service\r\nman, and I said, \"Am I a kook or what's wrong with me?\" I said, \"They\r\nkeep saying three shots--three shots,\" and I said, \"I know I heard\r\nmore. I heard from four to six shots anyway.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Mrs. Hill, we were standing at the window and we heard more\r\nshots also, but we have three wounds and we have three bullets, three\r\nshots is all that we are willing to say right now.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, did that Secret Service man try to suggest to you\r\nthat there were only three shots in any other way than that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's all he said to me. He didn't say, \"You have to say\r\nthree shots\"--he didn't tell me what to say.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. He didn't try to intimidate you or coerce you in any way?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; that's all he said.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Go ahead and tell me what you told Mark Lane.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I told him--I was asked by them----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know who that Secret Service man was, by the way?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; I don't. I don't know--not any name that day except\r\nDecker and the President.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right, go ahead and tell me everything else you said.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Then, he asked me--I was asked did I know that a bullet\r\nstruck at my feet and I said, \"No; I didn't.\" And he said, \"What do\r\nyou think that dust was?\" And I said, \"I didn't see any dust.\" And I\r\ntold Mark Lane that the Times Herald did run a picture in the paper of\r\na concrete scar where a bullet had hit right where we were standing,\r\nwhich is evident to anybody that had an issue of the Times Herald.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did you see that concrete?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I didn't go back down there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Do you know whether or not a bullet did hit that concrete?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. As I say, I saw the picture in the newspaper.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Aside from seeing it in the newspaper, do you know\r\nanything about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; other than what the man said he saw out of the window of\r\nthe courthouse, the Secret Service man said and it struck at my feet,\r\nother than that--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else did you tell Mark Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. So, he asked me, \"Did you have to stay down there or did you\r\nstay of your own accord?\" And I said, \"No; we had stay there.\" He said\r\nsomething--he said, \"Were you threatened or something?\" And I told him\r\nI wasn't threatened, but--he said, \"How do you know you were held?\"\r\nOr something like that, and I said, \"Because I tried to leave twice.\r\nAt one time I saw people I knew on the street and I was going to go\r\ndown and talk to them and I went down and they came down and got me,\r\nand another time I went down when the evening edition of the paper hit\r\nthe street and two men,\" and I told him, I did not tell him they were\r\nSecret Service men, but they were men from the sheriff's office. There\r\nwere some kind of deputy or something that came down and took me back\r\nand they were not playing. They meant to take me back. They did take my\r\narms and I knew I was going, because I just kept standing on the corner\r\nsaying, \"No; I don't want to go back yet. Please let me stay down here\r\njust a little while.\" They did make us go back in there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where were they from?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. They were from the sheriff's office, they were just\r\ndeputies--they weren't FBI or Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Was it after that that you gave the affidavit to the\r\nsheriff?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What else did you tell Mark Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I told him that my story had already been given, that\r\nthey had an affidavit down there, and he said, \"Were you ever at any\r\ntime--\" I think he said, \"Were you ever at any time told not to say\r\nsomething or this, that, and the other,\" and I said, \"The only thing\r\nthat I was told not to say was to not mention the man running,\" and he\r\nsaid, \"And why?\" And I said, \"Well, it was an FBI or Secret Service\r\nthat told me not to, but they came in to me just right after I was\r\ntaken--I was in there in the pressroom, and told me in fact--I told\r\nhim it was Featherstone that told me. He said, \"You know you were wrong\r\nabout seeing a man running.\" He said, \"You didn't.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who told you you were wrong--Featherstone or Lane?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Featherstone. And I told him that--I told Mr. Lane that Mr.\r\nFeatherstone had told me that, and I said, \"But I did,\" and he said,\r\n\"No; don't say that any more on the air.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Who said, \"Don't say that any more on the air?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Featherstone; and I made it clear to Mark Lane, because I\r\nmentioned his name several times, and he said, \"He has told me not to\r\ntell anyone\"----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. You mean Featherstone?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes; that the shots had come from a window up in the\r\nDepository and for me not to say that any more, that I was wrong about\r\nit, and I said \"Very well,\" and so I just didn't say any more that I\r\nran across the street to see the man, and that's the part, as much as I\r\ncan get from when the FBI men came out and talked to me the other day,\r\nthat is the part mostly that I got that was out of context, because\r\nwhat he gave the Commission was basically true.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What Mark Lane gave the Commission?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Except for what----\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Except he didn't have his comments in there.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. What were his comments?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, as I said, the way he would ask me things I can see\r\nwhy I gave the answers I did, which to me are the truth, but I can\r\nsee, taken out of context, why he or the Commission, well, not how he,\r\nbecause he was listening to me--how the Commission could take it to\r\nmean maybe something else?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he repeat then to the Commission how the Commission\r\ncould take them to mean maybe something else?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes----\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Did he repeat them to the Commission out of context--did\r\nMark Lane repeat them out of context?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. To me they were--to me they were--it was my comments and it\r\nwasn't everything I said.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Have you now related all of the ways that Mark Lane took\r\nyour comments out of context?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. So far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, is there anything else about your conversation with\r\nMark Lane which you think would be helpful to the Commission to know\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, before getting on to Mark Lane, we were talking about\r\nthe times you had been interviewed by the authorities and you had told\r\nme you were interviewed a couple of times by telephone by the FBI when\r\nyou called back to verify it was the FBI and about a single interview\r\nyou had with the FBI a week ago today, which would have been the 17th\r\nof March?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, have you had any additional interviews with any\r\nFederal authorities before today, other than those which you have\r\nalready told me about?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No; not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Now, for the record, Mrs. Hill, I'm going to ask you some\r\nquestions about your own background--first of all I would like you to\r\ntell me how old you are, for the record?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Thirty-three.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And where is your home area--Dallas or some other part of\r\nthe country or what?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Where am I from?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Where are you from?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what city in Oklahoma?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Originally Wewoka and later Oklahoma City.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And are you married?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there any unusual status with respect to your being\r\nmarried at this moment?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I am in the process of getting a divorce.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how many children have you?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I have two--a boy 12 and a girl 10.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your educational background?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I was graduated from Wewoka High School and Oklahoma Baptist\r\nUniversity in Shawnee.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year did you graduate from high school?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. 1948.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what year from college?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. 1954, after two babies later.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is that a 4-year college?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And how are you occupied at the present time?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I taught 7 years in Oklahoma City public schools and for\r\nthe past year and a half I have been doing substitute teaching for the\r\nDallas Board of Education.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your maiden name?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Lollis.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And what is your husband's occupation?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. He is a consultant for Science Research Associates, lately\r\nIBM.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. And is there anything else that you would care to tell me\r\nwhich you think might be of aid to the Commission in its investigation?\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. No.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Thank you very much for coming and giving your deposition.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Am I completely through with the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. I think this will be the end of it--we have all of the\r\nrecords, and to the best of my expectation--yes; but you could be\r\ncalled anytime. You have both the pleasure and the discomfort, but the\r\ndistinction of having been an eye witness.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Well, I know, I have always been rather--I mean, it's not\r\nsomething you are--you are not proud to say it, but I think it was part\r\nof history and I was glad I was there, but because I got publicity,\r\nbecause--I think my children will be interested to know that someday\r\nthat I was in it someway.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, let me say, as to the best of my knowledge there are\r\nno further plans for the Commission to call you again. This transcript\r\nwill be reviewed by me in Washington and by my colleagues in Washington\r\nand it is possible that you may be contacted again. Perhaps I might\r\ntalk to you again by telephone or perhaps the FBI, or it is even\r\nconceivable the Commission might want to hear from you, yourself, in\r\nWashington, but my best estimate of the situation right now is that we\r\nhave the basic information from you which we need.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. I told the FBI the other day I did not want to go to\r\nWashington. I don't think I can take any more laughing at.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. Well, we won't call on you unless it is concluded that it\r\nis absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Good. I was hoping this would do it.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. All right. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMrs. HILL. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. SPECTER. For the purposes of the record, this diagram which was\r\nused during the deposition of Mrs. Hill will be marked Hill Exhibit No.\r\n5.\r\n\r\n(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Hill Exhibit No. 5,\r\nfor identification.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF AUSTIN L. MILLER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Austin L. Miller was taken at 2:40 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you stand and be sworn, sir.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthe President's Commission is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you state your name for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Austin L. Miller.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. 1006 Powl Circle, Mesquite, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that a suburb of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes; it is just a little town.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far out of Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. It borders the city limits of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Twenty-six\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Married?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to school in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Tenth grade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I quit school and went to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you work?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. First worked at Titche's, and then for Robertson & King\r\nMotor Supply, and from there I went back to Titche's, and then to A. &\r\nP. Bakery Co., and then I worked for Presto Delivery Co., and then to\r\nTexas-Louisiana Freight Bureau where I am working now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long have you been there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Ever since 1958, January 1958.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you do now?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Well, it is a combination job between mail clerk and tariff\r\ncompiler.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you working on Friday, November 22, 1963, which\r\nwas the day that President Kennedy came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where is that located?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. 215 Union Terminal.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where is the Union Terminal located?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. That is down at--the address they give is 400 South Houston\r\nStreet, but the book is not the correct address, but that is what they\r\nuse. Because 400 is the opposite side of the block, and there is a city\r\npark there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What cross street? Would it be near any intersection at all,\r\nor not?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. On the corner of Houston, and I can't think of the name of\r\nthat street now, right in front of the Dallas Morning News.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it be north or south of Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. It would be south.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many blocks south of Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Four blocks.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Four blocks south of Main Street on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, where were you at about the time the motorcade\r\ncame by?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I was standing on the top of the triple underpass on the\r\nMain Street side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you say triple underpass, there are actually three\r\nunderpasses there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes. They are sitting side by side. It is Main, Commerce,\r\nand Elm. I was over Elm instead of Main Street. I was over Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now there is a place where the railroad tracks are, and that\r\nis the first. Is it all railroad tracks, or part railroad tracks and\r\npart freeway?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. All railroad tracks go over that particular set of\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where you were?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you get there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. About 12:15 or 12:20.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what time the motorcade came by?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No; I don't, not for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how long after you got there did you see the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. About 10 or 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone else standing around there that you knew?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Royce Skelton, the boy I work with and an elderly man who\r\nis a building maintenance man. By name, I don't know him, but a lot of\r\nother employees I have seen in the building other than myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone else that you knew?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. As far as knowing, no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw other people there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any police officer around there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. There was one on both sides of the bridge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, describe what happened. Did you see the motorcade come\r\nby?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir; it came down Main Street and turned north on\r\nHouston Street and went over two blocks and turned left onto Elm Street.\r\n\r\nGot about halfway down the hill going toward the underpass and that is\r\nwhen as far as I can recall the first shot was fired.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you know it was a shot when you heard it?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I didn't know it. I thought at first the motorcycle\r\nbackfiring or somebody throwed some firecrackers out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you hear or see?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. After the first one, just a few seconds later, there was\r\ntwo more shots fired or, or sounded like a sound at the time. I didn't\r\nknow for sure. And it was after that I saw some man in the car fall\r\nforward, and a woman next to him grab him and hollered, and just what,\r\nI don't know exactly what she said.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. About that time I turned and looked toward the--there is\r\na little plaza sitting on the hill. I looked over there to see if\r\nanything was there, who threw the firecracker or whatever it was, or\r\nsee if anything was up there, and there wasn't nobody standing there,\r\nso I stepped back and looked on the tracks to see if anybody run across\r\nthe railroad tracks, and there was nobody running across the railroad\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nSo I turned right straight back just in time to see the convertible\r\ntake off fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the convertible in which the President was riding?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I wouldn't want to say it was the President. It was a\r\nconvertible, but I saw a man fall over. I don't know whose convertible\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did the shots sound like they came from?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Well, the way it sounded like, it came from the, I would\r\nsay from right there in the car. Would be to my left, the way I was\r\nlooking at him over toward that incline.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can think of that you saw.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. About the time I looked over to the side there, there was\r\na police officer. No; a motorcycle running his motor under against the\r\ncurb, and jumped off and come up to the hill toward the top and right\r\nbehind him was some more officers and plainclothesmen, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone that might be, that gave any suspicious\r\nmovements of any kind over there?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone when you looked around on the railroad\r\ntracks, that you hadn't seen before?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir; I didn't. We was all standing in one group right\r\nat the rail looking over, and the police officer, he was standing about\r\n5 or 10 feet behind us.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now about how many were there in that group altogether, if\r\nyou can remember?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I would say in the neighborhood of 10 or 12 people. Maybe\r\nmore, maybe less.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Apart from those people, did you see anyone else in the\r\nvicinity at all on the railroad tracks?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. There was one young man or boy. He was going to come up on\r\nthe tracks, but the police officer stopped him and asked him where he\r\nwas going, and he said he was going to come up where he could see, and\r\nhe asked if he worked for the train station, and he said, \"No,\" so the\r\npolice officer made him go back down.\r\n\r\nWhere he went to, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When was this?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Oh, before the President came along.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how much before, do you know? Offhand?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know anything about this man or boy that you\r\ndescribed? About how old he was, or anything?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I can't think. I would say he was in his early twenties.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Tall or short?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I don't remember that much about him. I do recall him\r\ncoming up and the man talking to him and turning him back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So he went back down?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did he come up from?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. He came up from the--I am going by where I was standing. He\r\nwas from our left, from around behind that parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him again or not?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see anyone else in that area at all or anything\r\non the railroad tracks at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir; not until after the shots were fired and the\r\npolice officers came up the hill and climbed over the fence and started\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That was the only other people that you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. That is all I recall seeing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that you can add that might be of help in any\r\nway to the Commission, or to the investigation into the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Offhand, no, sir; I don't recall anything else.\r\n\r\nMy statement at the time may have some more, but I don't recall exactly\r\nwhat all did happen for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you and I never met until just a few minutes ago, did\r\nwe?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And as soon as you came in here, we started immediately\r\ntaking your testimony under oath, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We never talked about the facts before then, did we?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you have the right, if you like, to read this\r\ndeposition when it is typewritten, and sign it, or else you can waive\r\nthe signing of it and have it go directly to Washington without your\r\nsigning. What would be your preference?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. If you rather it would be signed----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We do not require it to be signed.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. It makes no difference.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We have no preference. We do not require your signing. You\r\ncan waive the signing of it to save yourself a trip coming down here\r\nagain, or you have the right, if you like, to come down and read it and\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. I will just waive it, because it would be to my advantage\r\nto not have to take off.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, we sure appreciate your coming down and thank you\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing. We have a sketch. I want to ask you to put on\r\nthe sketch where you were.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Handing you what we call \"A. Miller Deposition Exhibit A.\" I\r\nam going to try and get this thing oriented here.\r\n\r\nHere is Houston Street running north this way.\r\n\r\nThere is Elm. Here is the railroad overpass, and here is the freeway\r\noverpass.\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Now where this \"X\" is at up here, is where we was standing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where it is marked \"Pos. 5,\" there is an arrow there which I\r\nhave put there, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the \"X,\" which appears to be right over the overpass of\r\nElm, which would be to the east side of the overpass, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. MILLER. Yes, sir; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, sir.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF FRANK E. REILLY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Frank E. Reilly was taken at 2 p.m., on April 8, 1964,\r\nin the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and\r\nErvay Streets, Dallas.

Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give\r\nbefore the Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Frank E. Reilly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your address?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. 3309 Thibet, T-h-i-b-e-t [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Electrician, Union Terminal.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You received a letter from the Commission, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Advising you that your deposition was to be taken?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you born and raised?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I was born in Fort Worth.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many years ago?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I left over there when I was 17 and I am 70 now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of education do you have?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Not too good--I went through the ninth grade.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What have you done since then, generally, just in a general\r\nway--you don't need to go into great detail?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I've been with the Terminal Co. since 1916.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have been a railroad man all of your life, then?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, were you working for the Union Terminal\r\nCo.?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were you doing that day?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We had been working on the mail conveyor up close to the\r\nother end.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was that?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Mail conveyor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who were you working with?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I was by myself--it was on a Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About noon did you go down to someplace near Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I went over to Mr. Holland's shop and then we went up there\r\ntogether to see the parade.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went over to Mr. Holland's office?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Mr. Holland's shop.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is Mr. Holland's occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. He is a signal supervisor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For the Union Terminal Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We taken a walk up through the overpass right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you stand on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, we went over to the railing and stood there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And with reference to what streets--were you standing over\r\nElm, over Main, or over Commerce?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, you mean when this parade came down?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We were between them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Between what streets?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Elm and Main.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have a map here which has been used in the deposition of\r\nanother witness, but it gives some idea of the location there--this is\r\nnorth--this shows the corner of Elm and Houston Streets.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it shows where Elm turns and goes under the railroad, the\r\noverpass.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We were between the two.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you take this pen and this is Elm and here is Main, and\r\nmake a mark and show me where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. This is the overpass right there?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; this is the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We was between these two streets--there was big banisters\r\nup there and it was about like that, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We will put a mark there.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. (The witness Reilly marked the instrument as requested by\r\nCounsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And I will put on that position \"7\"--you were standing there\r\nwhen the motorcade came along?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was standing there with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I believe it was Mr. Dodd and Skinney.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what are his initials?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Dick Dodd.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's R. C. Dodd, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what is his position with the Union Terminal Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Foreman of the laborers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who else was with him?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. These two fellows here--were standing out there, but I\r\ndon't know their names?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What are their names?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I don't know their names--I don't even associate with them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about Mr. Holland?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We were together.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. S. M. Holland was there?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. We were together.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Holland and Dodd and you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. And me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, there were how many other men?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, there were three or four--but I don't know who they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have seen two of them here, haven't you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; two of them out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you know one's name is----\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I wouldn't know it--their name--I don't even know their\r\nname only by seeing them. I do go in there in the office once in a\r\nwhile to put in lamps.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know the name of Skelton, isn't there a fellow named\r\nSkelton there?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And a man named Miller?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you all standing at about the same location?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. All right close together.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any police officers there?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. One behind me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. One behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. He was standing back close to the tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be where?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. About 8 or 10 feet back of us.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any other police officers there?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. On the far side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you mean by \"far side\"?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Up to the side of where the tracks are on the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It would be west of where you are standing--you put a mark\r\ndown and show me where the two police officers were standing, as you\r\nremember it.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Now, this is all tracks over here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All tracks along the railroad overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; these are all tracks in here. One of them was standing\r\nbehind me and one of them was standing back around here--back along\r\nhere, but just how far back, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a mark down there for me where the two police officers\r\nwere standing.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I have an idea one of them was standing here, and for sure,\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was the other one standing?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. He was on the far side, but I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, mark that \"8.\"\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. He was on the far side--and how far back--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you mean by \"far side\"? Do you mean he was south of\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; he was west of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You see on the map, it's marked \"Elm, Main and\r\nCommerce\"--this other police officer was near what?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I wouldn't know because I wasn't facing him and there was\r\ntwo of them up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Back; by \"far side\" you mean that he was south of you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; he was west of me--you see, this place is east and\r\nwest--these streets.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But the railroad overpass goes north and south?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; north and south.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, if he was west of you, he would be behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; behind me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there two police officers behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; there was two of them--both of them--one close and one\r\nhere----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Listen to the question--there were two police officers there,\r\nwas there?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they both behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. One was closer than the other one?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How close was the one that was closer to you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I have an idea about 8 or 10 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how far away was the other one?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. About the width of that overpass across--75 or 80 feet\r\nacross there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. One was 8 or 10 feet from you, and the other one was 75 feet\r\nfrom you and they were both behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the motorcade come down Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; not until it turned and started to come under the\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you first see it?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. When it turned off of Houston Street and started around.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Onto Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the first time you saw the President's car, when it\r\nturned off Houston Street onto Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many people were there on the overpass at the time--at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Just what I told you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me again.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, there was Holland and me and Dick Dodd and those two\r\nfellows out there and the two policemen--that's all I remember seeing\r\nout there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear something?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Three shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did they seem to come from; what direction?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. It seemed to me like they come out of the trees.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What trees?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the north side of Elm--on what corner?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, where all those trees are--you've never been down\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; I've been there, but you tell me--I want you to tell me\r\nbecause it has to go on the record here and it has to be in writing.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, it's at that park where all the shrubs is up\r\nthere--it's to the north of Elm Street--up the slope.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any pigeons fly?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; I didn't pay no attention to that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I just stood there a few minutes and then I went on down to\r\nthe shop.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which way did you walk?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. South.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. South?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Toward the post office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your shop is down south of that place?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes; it's the other side of the station.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who walked with you?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Nobody.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You walked alone?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all, Mr. Reilly. This will be written up and\r\nyou can look it over and correct it if you wish, or you can waive your\r\nsignature if you wish.\r\n\r\nWhich do you wish--do you want to come down and sign it, or do you want\r\nto waive your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. No; I'll do anything you want me to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you do anything you want to--it's your option--what do\r\nyou want to do?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. I'll sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nThis young lady will write it up and call you and you can come down\r\nhere and sign it. How is that?\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. Well, will I have to come back?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; you will.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. It is hard for me to get off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is--why don't you waive your signature, if it is\r\ninconvenient to you, and we will offer this diagram as Exhibit A to\r\nyour deposition.\r\n\r\nMr. REILLY. All right.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as \"Reilly Exhibit A,\" for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF EARLE V. BROWN\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Earle V. Brown was taken at 4:40 p.m., on April 7,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Street, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you please rise, raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Sit down. State your name and address, please.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Earle V. Brown, 618 North Rosemont.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With the Dallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been a policeman?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Fourteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you born and what is your education and training?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I was born on a farm near Lyons, Nebraska, in 1917, and I\r\ncompleted 12 years of schooling, high school.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. High school?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, I stayed on the farm until 1939, then I moved to Ohio;\r\nLima, Ohio. I was inducted into the Army and was in there 4 years, 5\r\nmonths, discharged 1945, August 15, and I was here in Dallas actually\r\nwhen I was discharged and then back to Ohio for about 4 years. Then,\r\nlet's see, that would be August of 1949, we came back to Dallas and\r\nthen February 27, 1950, I joined the police force.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you are a patrolman, aren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1964, were you assigned to a certain post on\r\nduty?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That would be the railroad overpass over Stemmons Expressway\r\nservice road.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the one that leads off Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. You mean that crosses Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That crosses Elm, yes; the overpass across Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What does it cross?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. It's over Stemmons Expressway; in other words, they make\r\nthat turn off Elm and go up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You know where Elm, the corner of Elm and Houston is?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then there is a road, the highway continues on to the west, a\r\nlittle south, is that what you call the Stemmons Expressway?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. There's one there, too, but that overpass is actually a\r\nroad. Where I was was the railroad overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The railroad overpass itself?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far were you from the place where the continuation of Elm\r\ngoes under the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Oh, approximately 100 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me see if we can get something in the record that will be\r\nyour position. You were appointed to this particular spot?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there another patrolman on the overpass also?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir; James Lomax.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, this is the place where the railroad yards run over the\r\nhighway?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are on the Stemmons Freeway end of it?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That's right; in other words, Stemmons Freeway and the\r\nservice road both go under the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. James Lomax.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far were you from the point where Elm Street goes under\r\nthe underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I would say approximately 100 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Approximately 100 yards in what direction?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That would be--wouldn't be straight east, but it would be to\r\neasterly, kind of off at an angle--I would say about from us about a\r\n20° angle to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You would be east or west?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. We would be to the southwest of that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You would be to the southwest of that?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, I would say that's about right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have the corner of Houston and Elm Street in sight\r\nfrom where you were located?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Actually, we could see cars moving there, you know, coming\r\nand making the turn, but the intersection, that would be about all we\r\nprobably could see would be cars.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you see cars going down after they made the turn and\r\ngoing down toward the underpass south?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You could see those?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have any instructions when you were assigned to this\r\nlocation?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were they?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Not allow anyone on the overpass whatever and walk forward\r\nand make both ends--in other words, check both ends of the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was you and Mr. Lomax?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there an E. V. Brown?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That's me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's you, and was there also a Joe Murphy?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Joe Murphy is a three-wheeler.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; where was he?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I don't know, sir; he was, I believe he was on his\r\nthree-wheeler.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On his motor?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I believe; I wouldn't say for sure but I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you people keep people off the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. We made no contact with anyone except one of the railroad\r\ndetectives come up there and talked to us.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you keep the underpass free of people?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Underneath?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; up above.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Up above; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about underneath?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, that was roadway there; people wouldn't be able to\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the top of the overpass you kept that free of people?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have the railroad yards in sight?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They would be what direction from where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That would be east; that would be east of us.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. East, maybe a little north?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, the whole thing kind of in that general direction, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any people over in the railroad yards?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Not that I recall; now they were moving trains in and out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did not see people standing?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir; sure didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Everything was in clear view?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I withdraw the question. Was there any obstruction of your\r\nvision to the railroad yards?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Not the direction of the railroad yard, but at ground level\r\nwe didn't have very good view. Mr. Lomax and I remarked that we didn't\r\nhave a very good view.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that because of the moving trains?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's motorcade come on to Houston\r\nStreet from Elm; were you able to see that?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Now they came down Main, didn't they, to Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir; actually, the first I noticed the car was when it\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. After it made the turn and when the shots were fired, it\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it come to a complete stop?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. That, I couldn't swear to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It appeared to be slowed down some?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes; slowed down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did they seem to come from?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, they seemed high to me, actually; if you want, would\r\nyou like me to tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Sure, tell it in your own words.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, down in that river bottom there, there's a whole lot\r\nof pigeons this particular day, and they heard the shots before we did\r\nbecause I saw them flying up--must have been 50, 75 of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was the river bottom?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. You know, actually off to the--between us and the, this\r\noverpass you are talking about there's kind of a levee along there.\r\nIt's really a grade of the railroad, is what it is; that's where they\r\nwere and then I heard these shots and then I smelled this gun powder.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. It come on it would be maybe a couple minutes later so--at\r\nleast it smelled like it to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What direction did the sound seem to come from?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. It came it seemed the direction of that building, that\r\nTexas----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any pigeons flying around the building?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I just don't recall that; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which way did you look when you heard the sound?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. When I first heard that sound I looked up toward that\r\nbuilding because actually it seemed to come from there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was it you saw the pigeons rise?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. They must have been down there feeding at that time because\r\nthey just seemed to all take off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were they from where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. From where I was standing they would be about half way\r\nbetween--no, they would be up more toward that other overpass, what\r\nthey call the triple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were about 100 yards from the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Approximately; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anybody standing on the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. On the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes, sir; they had at least two officers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anybody but police officers?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Not that I know of. I didn't recall anyone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, let me see, by that time the escort as to the\r\nmotorcycles, we could see them coming, the front part of the motorcade,\r\nI don't think they probably realized what happened; they had come on\r\nahead. And then we saw the car coming with the President, and as it\r\npassed underneath me I looked right down and I could see this officer\r\nin the back; he had this gun and he was swinging it around, looked like\r\na machinegun, and the President was all sprawled out, his foot on the\r\nback cushion. Of course, you couldn't conceive anything that happened;\r\nof course, we knew something had happened, but we couldn't conceive the\r\nfact it did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you move out of there in any direction?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir; we, well, we checked there; the area, we kept\r\nchecking that area through there and, of course, there were people\r\nall over the place but we didn't allow anybody up on the railroad\r\nright-of-way through there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anybody standing on the triple underpass at the\r\npoint where Elm goes underneath?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Uh-uh, I couldn't recall; no one except police officers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. More than one?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you search any part of the area?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. We were instructed to stay at our posts, which we did, and\r\nlater we got instructions to check the area around the Depository, Book\r\nDepository Building, and to obtain the license numbers of all those\r\ncars parked around there, which we did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were any cars parked?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, there's a parking lot around that building and there\r\nwas several cars parked all around that building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You took the license numbers?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes; in fact, I think there must have been four or five\r\nofficers taking license numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long were you around there?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, we stayed and then they sent us back to the overpass\r\nand we stayed there until, let's see, I don't believe we left there\r\nuntil about 3:30 or 4 in the afternoon, and then we came up to the hall\r\nand Mr. Sorrels, I believe talked to us.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all, officer. This will be written up and you\r\ncan take it, read it, and sign it if you wish, or you can waive your\r\nsignature, just as you wish. Which do you wish?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. You mean today?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; it will be a week or so.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which do you prefer?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. What preference do I have?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, it will be written up and you can come in and sign\r\nit----\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or you can waive signature and you don't need to come in and\r\nsign it. It is your option; you can do either way.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I will be glad to come in and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She will notify you. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF EARLE V. BROWN RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Earle V. Brown was taken at 2:15 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have been sworn, so we will just continue with your\r\ndeposition, and your name is Earle V. Brown?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Right; E-a-r-l-e (spelling).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Brown, I have had a map made here which I would like to\r\nhave you inspect here. The railroad overpass is shown--that runs in a\r\nnorth and south direction?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Stemmons Freeway overpass is shown--that runs north and\r\nsouth, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you on either one of those overpasses?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Either one of those two there?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. On this overpass here--this TP Railroad overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The overpass that runs in an east and west direction?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Right--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, will you take this pen and draw on there your position\r\non the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, you see, on this overpass, of course, there are the\r\ntracks and then there is a railing and then there is a catwalk on each\r\nside and we walked the catwalk, and we would come around on each end\r\nand we would walk the tracks and come around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you saw the President's car turn on\r\nHouston and Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I was on the catwalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you mark your position?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. I would be--approximately in the center. (Instrument marked\r\nby the witness, as requested by Counsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you marked the place where you were?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes; it would be about the center of that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that where you were when you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you see anybody out on the railroad overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir; I didn't see anybody there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't recall seeing anybody that would either be where\r\nElm goes under the overpass or where Main goes under the overpass--you\r\ndon't recall seeing anybody?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No; I don't recall seeing anyone there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told me yesterday you saw some officers.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Well, that would be the police officers--would be the only\r\nones I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know who those officers were?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, sir; at the time I did, but I wouldn't know now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any officer on Stemmons Freeway where we have\r\npositioned (1), (2), and (3) on this diagram?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. No, I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the place where you marked your location--we will mark\r\nthat as Brown Exhibits--the X marks the position of Brown, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. All right. (Instrument marked by the reporter as \"Brown\r\nExhibit A,\" for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thank you very much for coming.\r\n\r\nMr. BROWN. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROYCE G. SKELTON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Royce G. Skelton was taken at 2:45 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan\r\nand Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthe Commission will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please, for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Royce G. Skelton.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your business?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I am a mail clerk at the Texas Louisiana Freight Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where do you work?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. At the Texas Louisiana Freight Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you born and where did you come from?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I was born in Henrietta, Tex., May 25, 1940.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I attended all grade schools in Wichita Falls and I\r\ngraduated from Wichita Falls High School.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me where you went to school.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Wichita Falls through high school and I attended 1 year at\r\nMidwestern University.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And when did you go to work for the railroad?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. February 1, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work do you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Mail clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, did you watch the parade, the motorcade\r\nof the President?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes, sir; I went to the triple overpass about 12:20--I\r\nthink it was 12:15, or something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Whom did you go down there with?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Austin Miller and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where does he work?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. He is a mail clerk also in the same company.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you stand to watch the parade?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Well, we were directly over Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Directly over Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Maybe it would be to the left-hand side, if you were on\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anybody else there on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. There were quite a few people up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know any of them?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Well, I know by sight--I knew the electrician, an old man\r\nthat's an electrician.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Frank Reilly?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Is that his name?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The man that was here a moment ago--his name is Reilly.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I know him when I see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes----\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. And Austin Miller, of course.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know Dodd, the employee of the railroad?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No, sir; like I say, I recognized them off and on when I\r\nsee them around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any police officers there?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes; this man right here--they say it was him--I don't\r\nrecall whether it was or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who--Mr. Brown?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. The one who was in here just a while ago--they say he was\r\nthe one up there, but I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't recognize him there?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No; I didn't recognize him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, you saw some police officers up there?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were they standing?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. There was one standing directly behind me, I think, or in\r\nthe general vicinity, and there was one on the far side of the triple\r\nunderpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By \"far side,\" you mean where?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. It would be back on this side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It would be south?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No, sir; that would be the east side--isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Elm runs east and west.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. It would be the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It would be west?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes, sir; and then there was one back over here on\r\nStemmons--I noticed one, at least, over there and one on the railroad\r\noverpass on Stemmons.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many police officers were on this overpass, the railroad\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Two, I would say, sir. That's all I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how many men did you see standing right near on the\r\nrailroad overpass over Elm, just approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Eight, including the officer--eight or nine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car turn on Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes, sir; I saw the car carrying the Presidential flag\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you hear something soon after that?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Just about the same time the car straightened up--got\r\naround the corner--I heard two shots, but I didn't know at that time\r\nthey were shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did they seem to come from?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Well, I couldn't tell then, they were still so far from\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the shots sound like they came from where you were\r\nstanding?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No, sir; definitely not. It sounded like they were right\r\nthere--more or less like motorcycle backfire, but I thought that they\r\nwere these dumbballs that they throw at the cement because I could see\r\nthe smoke coming up off the cement.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw some smoke come off of the cement?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did it seem to you that the sound came from, what\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Towards the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Right around the motorcycles and all that--I couldn't\r\ndistinguish because it was too far away.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you stand there?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I stood there from about 12:15 until the time the\r\nPresident was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I think I heard four--I mean--I couldn't be sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think you heard four?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you stay there after you heard the fourth shot?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Not very long--just as soon as the cars sped away and\r\neverything was in a big commotion--we ran down to listen to the radio.\r\nWe couldn't get anything off of that--we heard that the President had\r\nbeen shot and so we went back up there and the police officer asked\r\nus if we had seen the assassination and we told him we had. He said\r\nhe would like to get a statement from us, so he took us over to the\r\nsheriff's office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any pigeons flying or anything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No, sir; I didn't see anything like that--any pigeons at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all I have. This will be written up and\r\nsubmitted to you for your signature, if you want to sign it, or you can\r\nwaive your signature.\r\n\r\nWhich do you want to do?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I will waive my signature. I am sure it is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is fine. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. There's one thing I could say--you have that other report?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. About when I saw one of the bullets where it hit on the\r\npavement and it hit, the smoke did come from the general vicinity of\r\nwhere you say Oswald was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wait a minute--let me ask you some questions about that.\r\n\r\nTell me, now, about the smoke--did you see some smoke?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. After those two shots, and the car came on down closer to\r\nthe triple underpass, well, there was another shot--two more shots I\r\nheard, but one of them--I saw a bullet, or I guess it was a bullet--I\r\ntake for granted it was--hit in the left front of the President's car\r\non the cement, and when it did, the smoke carried with it--away from\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean there was some smoke in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No; on the pavement--you know, pavement when it is hit\r\nwith a hard object it will scatter--it will spread.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which way did it spread?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. It spread just right in line, like you said.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I haven't said anything--tell me what you think it was?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Like I said--south of us--it would be southwest, you know,\r\nin a direct line from the Texas Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see. In other words, the spray seemed to go to the west; is\r\nthat right?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nI'm going to get you to mark one of these maps and show where you were\r\nstanding. Here is Elm and here is the railroad underpass and pay no\r\nattention to the diagrams, but show me about where you were standing.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. I was about right there (marked instrument referred to as\r\nrequested by Counsel Ball).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By that \"X\" we will put the word \"Skelton\" and that is where\r\nyou were standing with your friend?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Approximately--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you see any smoke or anything from any place around\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. No, sir; I just stated to your secretary that I heard\r\npeople say they did, but I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you did see something light on the street?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About where?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. A bullet--let's see--this is kind of out of proportion\r\n[referring to diagram], and I would say the bullet hit about right here\r\n[indicating on diagram].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, let's mark that as \"Skelton (2)\" and we will make the\r\nfirst Skelton number (1) and then Skelton number (2), and this X mark\r\nhere is where you saw the bullet and which way did the spray go?\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Just like it was going there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mark an arrow showing the direction that you think the spray\r\nwas going.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. (Marks the diagram with arrow.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's fine, and we will make that as an exhibit Shelton\r\nexhibit A and attach it to your deposition.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as Skelton exhibit A for\r\nidentification)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thank you and that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. SKELTON. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF S. M. HOLLAND\r\n\r\nThe testimony of S. M Holland was taken at 2:20 p.m., on April 8, 1964\r\nin the Office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and\r\nErvay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel\r\nof the President's Commission. Mr. S M Holland was accompanied by his\r\nattorney, Mr. Balford Morrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would you rise please and raise your right hand so as to be\r\nsworn.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony that you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Sit down, please.\r\n\r\nYou have recorded Mr. Morrison's presence?\r\n\r\nThe Reporter. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr Holland, you have received a letter from the Commission\r\nasking you to come and testify today?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. As you know, the Commission is inquiring into all of the\r\nfacts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and we want\r\nyour evidence concerning what you saw at the time of the assassination\r\nfrom the place you were standing. May we have, for the record, your\r\nname and residence address?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. S. M. Holland, 1119 Lucille Street, Irving, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Signal supervisor for Union Terminal Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. How long have you been employed by that organization?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Union Terminal since 1938.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now on Friday November 22, will you describe what you did\r\nconcerning the President's visit and where you were?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, about 11:00 o'clock, a couple of policemen and a\r\nplain clothesman came up on top of the triple underpass, and we had\r\nsome men working up there, and I knew that they was going to have a\r\nparade, and I left my office, and walked up to the underpass to talk to\r\nthe policemen. And they asked me during the parade if I would come back\r\nup there and identify people that was supposed to be on that overpass.\r\nThat is the railroad people.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Where is your office Mr Holland?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. At the Union Terminal Station.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is that within walking distance of the triple overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes, it is. About--less than a quarter of a mile, a very\r\nshort distance.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And these policemen that you spoke to, there were 3\r\naltogether?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Two--there were 2 city policemen and 1 man in\r\nplainclothes. I didn't talk to him. I talked to the city policemen.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You don't know what his affiliation was?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I know he was a plainclothes detective or FBI agent or\r\nsome thing like that, but I don't know, and I told him I would be back\r\nand after lunch I would go up there.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Approximately what time did you arrive up there?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Oh, I arrived up there, I guess, about a quarter until 12,\r\nand I would identify each person that came up there that he worked at\r\nthe Union Terminal, and department so-and-so.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Whom did you see there at 11:45 when you returned, from then\r\nuntil 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, I would have to try to remember who all was up there\r\nthen. There was Mr. Reilly and Mr. R. C. Dodd.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Reilly?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Reilly.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Who was----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. R. C. Dodd, and N. H. Potter and Luke Winburn.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Luke?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Winburn.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And a fellow by the name of Johnson, he works in the car\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Johnson.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And there was another fellow who worked at the car\r\ndepartment, tall, blond-headed boy, and I can't remember his name.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That makes six people so far. Are these all employees of----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Of the terminal?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes, and they were two men, one of them worked for the\r\nKaty, and one for the T. & P., that I don't know their names, but I\r\ndo know that they were railroad people. They were over on business.\r\nWorking on those business cars, and one of them was a Katy employee,\r\nand one was a T. & P. employee.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Could you give me their full names?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Texas & Pacific, and the Missouri, Kansas, Texas Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You don't know the names of those particular men?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you see them here today?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I know the policemen talked to them and got identification\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes; but they are not, as far as you know, the two gentlemen\r\nthat you saw sitting in the anteroom to the U.S. attorney's office just\r\nbefore----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; neither one of those.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you recognize either of those two men?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. One of them is a cabdriver, and the other one is an\r\nelectrician at Union Terminal. The large fellow is a cabdriver.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The electrician, do you know his name?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Frank Reilly.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. There were two other men out there. Perhaps you didn't\r\nnotice them. I spoke to them after I spoke to you.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, at the time the parade got started they was, I\r\nguess--Davey Cowzert was up there, too.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. But, just to finish with the two, you didn't recognize\r\neither of the two people who were in the anteroom a few moments ago as\r\nbeing people who were on the overpass that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. There was two people I did recognize and that was the\r\ncabdriver and Mr. Reilly was out there and that policeman, he was up\r\nthere with me.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You recognized the policeman as being the policeman who was\r\non the triple overpass at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Fine. Now, another name just occurred to you of someone else.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Cowzert [spelling] C-o-w-z-e-r-t, Cowzert.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is he also an employee?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; he is.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Were all the people there, as far as you know, at the time\r\nthe Presidential motorcade----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Came into view?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. One more, if I can remember his name. One that run around\r\nthe corner of the fence with me. He was right behind me--why in the\r\nworld--he was one of the first ones around the fence when we run around\r\nthe fence to what was happening.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Before we get to that, how about the police. How many police\r\nofficers were on the overpass at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. There were two Dallas Police officers up there at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Tell me if this is correct, Mr. Holland. At the time the\r\nPresidential motorcade arrived, to the best of your recollection, on\r\nthe overpass there were two uniformed Dallas Police, and the following\r\nemployees of the Terminal Co.: Yourself, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Dodd, Mr.\r\nPotter, Mr. Winburn, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cowzert, and perhaps one other\r\nman?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So, that would be eight including yourself, plus two\r\nemployees of the railroad. One of the T. & P. and one of the Katy?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right. At that time. Now, like I said a while ago,\r\nby the time they started there was quite a few come up there, but I\r\ncan't remember who it was or their names, because----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Before the motorcade started?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Before the motorcade started.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. These were people you recognized as employees?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Some of them, and some of them I did not recognize, but I\r\nthink he was asking for credentials.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The uniformed policeman?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; one on that side, and one on this side to keep\r\nthem----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes; and did you participate in identifying people as being\r\nterminal or railroad employees?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. When they first started arriving, yes; it was my purpose\r\nfor going up there.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So, that it is fair to say that at the time the President's\r\nmotorcade turned into this area, there was no one on the overpass\r\nthat you didn't know either as Terminal Co. employees, or railroad\r\nemployees, or as a policeman?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Wouldn't be fair to say that, because there was quite a\r\nfew came up there right in the last moments.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. There were? Tell us about that.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That I couldn't recognize. There wasn't too many people\r\nup there, but there were a few that came up there the last few\r\nminutes, but the policemen were questioning them and getting their\r\nidentification, and----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Is this just about the time of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Just about the time, or just prior to it, because there\r\nwas a few up there that I didn't--that I didn't recognize myself.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Had they been, as far as you could tell, checked by the\r\npolice?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. He was checking them as they came on top of the underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did it seem to you that everybody up there had been checked\r\nby this policeman for identification?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I think everyone was checked by some person.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes. Can you estimate the number of people that were on the\r\noverpass immediately as the motorcade came into view?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, I would estimate that there was between 14 to 18\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now, where was the motorcade when you first saw it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Turned off the Main Street--in front of the county jail.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Turning right off of Main onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. It was coming down Main and turned off of Main onto\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. At that time will you show me on this drawing where you\r\nwere and just make a mark and put the No. 1 next to that mark. That is\r\nwhere you were at that time? Roughly in the middle of the overpass\r\nover Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And where, in relation to the concrete fence that----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Picket fence or concrete?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. No; the concrete.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Oh, the concrete banister?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The concrete banister. Were you right at the banister?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I was; would you like to see the exact location?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. This is my son standing in the exact location I was in\r\n[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Off the record a moment.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Back on the record. Well, then, we'll mark this as Exhibit\r\nB, reserving Exhibit A for this drawing, and Exhibit B is a photograph\r\nyou took on Saturday, November 23, of your son standing in the position\r\nat the banister of the triple overpass where you were at the time the\r\nmotorcade came into view.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Fine. That is quite a good picture. At that time, can you\r\nindicate, to the best of your knowledge where other persons were\r\nstanding on the overpass, and particularly in relationship to the two\r\npolice officers who were on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, as well as I remember, one police officer was\r\nstanding right behind me, or pretty close behind me.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Put a \"2\" where you believe he was standing.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. He was standing in close enough so that he could see,\r\nbut he could also see the people, and the other policeman, I think,\r\nunless he left immediately before this happened--see, when they turned\r\nthere. I didn't turn around and look back any more, but the last time\r\nI saw this policeman he was standing over here on this side, about\r\n[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Standing almost directly behind you?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. But, on the other side of the overpass, facing west?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; all this way, across the tracks. See, these are all\r\nrailroad tracks, and he was standing over here on this side immediately\r\nbefore this motorcade turned this. Now, after they turned, I don't\r\nknow, but--because I was watching them.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nWould you put a \"3\" where you believe he was standing and can you\r\nindicate on there where you believe the other 12 to 15 or 16 people\r\nwere who were on the overpass at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Were they all standing in one group?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. There was a pretty close group between this column here,\r\nand this place right in there. In other words, if I can--had a shot of\r\nit, we could find that pretty close. I don't know that I have one.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What you have indicated on the drawing is on the part of the\r\noverpass from one side of Elm Street to the other.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; this is one side of Elm Street, and this would be\r\nthe other. If you would get over here there would be a banister or\r\nsomething in your way, and this is grass out here, and you couldn't get\r\nto get too good a view, and most of the people was from this right in\r\nhere, over to right in here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right. Now----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And this bench runs right along similar to that, up here\r\nto this [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is a wooden picket fence that you are describing that\r\nruns from the end of the concrete banister?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Over to a little----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Little house there.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Little----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. What do they call that thing?\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Little pavilion? Little concrete pavilion?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now, what did you observe from that point on, Mr. Holland?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, I observed the motorcade when it turned off of Main\r\nStreet onto Houston Street and back on Elm Street. There was two young\r\nladies right across from this sign, which would be, I judge--would say\r\nthey were standing about here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Put No. 4 there, please. Fine.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And the motorcade was coming down in this fashion, and the\r\nPresident was waving to the people on this side [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is the north side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; on the north side.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And she was looking in this direction [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. \"She,\" is Mrs. Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. His wife. And about that time----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Was looking in a southern direction?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. In the southern direction.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. South side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And about that time he went over like that [indicating],\r\nand put his hand up, and she was still looking off, as well as I could\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now, when you say, \"he went like that,\" you leaned forward\r\nand raised your right hand?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Pulled forward and hand just stood like that momentarily.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. With his right hand?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. His right hand; and that was the first report that I heard.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What did it sound like?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, it was pretty loud, and naturally, underneath\r\nthis underpass here it would be a little louder, the concussion from\r\nunderneath it, it was a pretty loud report, and the car traveled a\r\nfew yards, and Governor Connally turned in this fashion, like that\r\n[indicating] with his hand out, and another report.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. With his right hand out?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Turning to his right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. To his right?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And another report rang out and he slumped down in his\r\nseat, and about that time Mrs. Kennedy was looking at these girls over\r\nhere [indicating]. The girls standing--now one of them was taking a\r\npicture, and the other one was just standing there, and she turned\r\naround facing the President and Governor Connally. In other words, she\r\nrealized what was happening, I guess.\r\n\r\nNow, I mean, that was apparently that--she turned back around, and by\r\nthe time she could get turned around he was hit again along in--I'd say\r\nalong in here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. How do you know that? Did you observe that?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I observed it. It knocked him completely down on the\r\nfloor. Over, just slumped completely over. That second----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you hear a third report?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I heard a third report and I counted four shots and\r\nabout the same time all this was happening, and in this group of\r\ntrees--[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now, you are indicating trees on the north side of Elm\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. These trees right along here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Let's mark this Exhibit C and draw a circle around the trees\r\nyou are referring to.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Right in there. (Indicating.)\r\n\r\nThere was a shot, a report, I don't know whether it was a shot. I\r\ncan't say that. And a puff of smoke came out about 6 or 8 feet above\r\nthe ground right out from under those trees. And at just about this\r\nlocation from where I was standing you could see that puff of smoke,\r\nlike someone had thrown a firecracker, or something out, and that\r\nis just about the way it sounded. It wasn't as loud as the previous\r\nreports or shots.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What number would that have been in the----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, that would--they were so close together.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. The second and third or the third and fourth?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. The third and fourth. The third and the fourth.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So, that it might have been the third or the fourth?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. It could have been the third or fourth, but there were\r\ndefinitely four reports.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You have no doubt about that?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I have no doubt about it. I have no doubt about seeing\r\nthat puff of smoke come out from under those trees either.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Mr. Holland, do you recall making a statement to an agent of\r\nof the FBI several days after?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I made a statement that afternoon in Sheriff Bill Decker's\r\noffice, and then the Sunday or the Sunday following the Friday, there\r\nwere two FBI men out at my house at the time that Oswald was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you tell them that you heard distinctly four shots at\r\nthat time?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You were certain then?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I was certain then and I--in that statement I believe that\r\nI----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Well, the FBI report that I have said that you heard either\r\nthree or four shots fired together, and I gather the impression of the\r\nagent was that you were uncertain whether it was three or four.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. At the time I made that statement, of course, I was pretty\r\nwell shook up, but I told the people at the sheriff's office, whoever\r\ntook the statement, that I believed there was four shots, because they\r\nwere so close together, and I have also told those two, four, six\r\nFederal men that have been out there that I definitely saw the puff of\r\nsmoke and heard the report from under those trees.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you realize that these were shots then?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; I think I realized what was happening out there.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You did?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. When Governor Connally was knocked down in the seat.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What did you then do?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, immediately after the shots was fired, I run around\r\nthe end of this overpass, behind the fence to see if I could see anyone\r\nup there behind the fence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That is the picket fence?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That is the picket fence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On the north side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Of course, this was this sea of cars in there and it was\r\njust a big--it wasn't an inch in there that wasn't automobiles and\r\nI couldn't see up in that corner. I ran on up to the corner of this\r\nfence behind the building. By the time I got there there were 12 or 15\r\npolicemen and plainclothesmen, and we looked for empty shells around\r\nthere for quite a while, and I left because I had to get back to the\r\noffice. I didn't give anyone my name. No one--didn't anyone ask for it,\r\nand it wasn't but an hour or so until the deputy sheriff came down to\r\nthe office and took me back up to the courthouse.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did he know you personally?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No, no; he had to find me and find where I was. He\r\ndidn't know me, and I don't know who told me they wanted me over at\r\nthe courthouse, so, I went back up there with him and made out the\r\nstatement, and made--made out the statement before they found out\r\nthe results on the shots, or before that Oswald had even shot that\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\nI was making out the statement before that, so, it was immediately\r\nafter the motorcade had passed through there.\r\n\r\nMr STERN. What was your impression about the source of these noises, if\r\nyou had one?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, the impression was that the shots, the first two or\r\nthree shots came from the upper part of the street, now, from where I\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. East on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes, up in here somewhere. [Indicating.] I didn't have\r\nthe least idea that it was up any higher, but I thought the shot was\r\ncoming--coming from this crowd in here [indicating]. That is what it\r\nsounded like to me from where I was.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You are indicating on this Exhibit C. Why don't you put a\r\nsquare around the area that you just pointed to. You had no idea, I\r\ntake it, that the shots were coming from your area?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. It is your impression that they did not, could not, as far\r\nas the sound was concerned?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. As far as the sound was concerned they did not.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you see anything on the overpass that seemed to you any\r\nway unusual?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Oh, no; no.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Back on the record. Now, Mr. Holland, I'm showing you a copy\r\nof an affidavit which I am marking as Exhibit D. That is the affidavit\r\nyou made that you described a few moments ago?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would you read that.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. \"I am signal supervisor for the Union Terminal, and I was\r\ninspecting signal and switches and stopped to watch the parade. I was\r\nstanding on the top of the triple underpass and the President's car was\r\ncoming down Elm Street, and when they got just about to the arcade, I\r\nheard what I thought for a moment was a firecracker and he slumped over\r\nand I looked over toward the arcade and trees and saw a puff of smoke\r\ncome from the trees and I heard three more shots after the first shot\r\nbut that was the only puff of smoke I saw. I immediately ran around\r\nto where I could see behind the arcade and did not see anyone running\r\nfrom there. But the puff of smoke I saw definitely came from behind the\r\narcade to the trees. After the first shot the President slumped over\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and tried to get over in the back seat to\r\nhim and then the second shot rang out. After the first shot the Secret\r\nService man raised up in the seat with a machine gun and then dropped\r\nback down in the seat. And they immediately sped off. Everything is\r\nspinning in my head and if I remember anything else later I will come\r\nback and tell Bill.\"\r\n\r\nThat is Mr. Decker. And--brother it was, too.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I'm sure it was.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Stand there and watch two or three men get killed----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Now, that statement makes clear that you heard four shots,\r\nthought you heard four shots at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. But, two of them was rather close together, though.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So close do you think that might have been one shot?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No, it was four.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You are clear there were four?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; it was different sounds, different reports.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right. Mr. Morrison, are there any questions you would\r\nlike to ask Mr. Holland to clarify any points that we discussed?\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. Mr. Holland, is there anything you might add to this?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, the only thing that I remember now that I didn't\r\nthen, I remember about the third car down from this fence, there was\r\na station wagon backed up toward the fence, about the third car down,\r\nand a spot. I'd say 3 foot by 2 foot, looked to me like somebody had\r\nbeen standing there for a long period. I guess if you could count them\r\nabout a hundred foottracks in that little spot, and also mud up on the\r\nbumper of that station wagon.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This was a car back--parked behind the picket fence? Well,\r\nwhy don't you put the Number \"5\" approximately where that car would\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. If we could call this the arcade [indicating]----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. And one, two, three, I think it would have been just about\r\nhere [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. That is Elm Street. It would be behind the fence,\r\nwouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, I have got the fence running up here, and this car\r\nwould be back in there [indicating]. This is the trees out here, which\r\nwould--and that is approximately the same location as--the car and the\r\ntrees that I saw the smoke would probably be the same location.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right. And this was a station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Now, the reason I didn't think so much about that at the\r\ntime, was because there was so many people out there, and there was law\r\nenforcement officers and I thought, well, if there is anything to that\r\nthey would pick that up, or notice it, but it looks like someone had\r\nbeen standing there for a long time, because it was muddy.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Tracks you saw in the mud?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. It was muddy, and you could have if you could have counted\r\nthem, I imagine it would have been a hundred tracks just in that one\r\nlocation. It was just----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And then you saw some mud on the bumper?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Mud on the bumper in two spots.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. As if someone had cleaned his foot, or----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Well, as if someone had cleaned their foot, or stood up on\r\nthe bumper to see over the fence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Because, you couldn't very well see over it standing down\r\nin the mud, or standing on the ground, and to get a better view you\r\ncould----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Was there anything else you noticed about this station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Do you recall the----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. They searched all the cars in that location.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did this occur to you----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. It occurred to me immediately when I saw it there; yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you thought about it later in the day?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I thought about it that night.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. In fact, I went to bed--it was about a week there I\r\ncouldn't sleep, much, brother, and I thought about it that night, and I\r\nhave thought about it a lot of times since then.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you ever go back to look at that site or look at the\r\nstation wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; I didn't go back that afternoon, because I spent the\r\nrest of the day in the county jail office over there, but a number of\r\nyour Federal Agents went out there then and Secret Service men. It was\r\njust a beehive.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. In a matter of a few minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you tell any of the Federal officers, or any of the\r\nDallas Police officers about it?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I don't think I did.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This is really the first time----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. This is the first time that I have discussed it, that I\r\nremember. Now, I might have told in our conversation. I don't remember\r\nthat, but I don't think I did.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I am not aware of any other occasion in which you did.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. You thought the officers there would take care of that?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I thought that the officers would take care of it\r\nbecause there were so many there, I thought they would take care of\r\neverything, and a layman didn't have any business up there, and I went\r\non back to my office.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. When you ran behind the picket fence after the shots were\r\nfired, did you come near the area where the station wagon was parked?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Went up to behind the arcade as far as you could go.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So, you would have passed where this station wagon was?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Or, that area?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes; immediately, but I turned around, see, and went to\r\nsearching in there for empty shells, and three or four agents there\r\nthen and that is when I walked back to the car there and noticed the\r\ntracks there in one little spot.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. When you first came around, that was quite soon after the\r\nshots were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And did you notice anything about this station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I was in front of the cars, then I went in front of the\r\ncars.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. In front of the cars----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. The cars they were parked pretty close to the fence, and I\r\ncame up in front of the cars and got over to the fence and then walked\r\nback down looking around, just like the rest of them.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And that was later you came behind the station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Oh, maybe 3 or 4 minutes after I got up there, and 3 or 4\r\nminutes after I got up to the end of the fence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. This number of cars, this is an area in which cars are\r\nregularly parked?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. A parking area for the School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; it is a parking area for the sheriff's department and\r\npeople over to the courthouse. They park in there.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Sheriff's department parks in there. District attorneys'\r\ncars park in there. It is railroad property, but they let them park in\r\nthere and save that 25 cents. Don't put that down. Might get in trouble.\r\n\r\nNow, do you want to know about the two policemen that were riding in\r\nthat motorcade and one of them throwed the motorcycle down right in the\r\nmiddle of the street and run up towards that location with his gun in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Toward----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. The location that----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Where you saw the puff of smoke?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. Where I saw the puff of smoke. And another one tried to\r\nride up the hill on his motorcycle and got about halfway up there and\r\nhe run up the rest of the way on foot.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Go ahead. This is at the time of the----\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. At the time of the----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. That the shots were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. The shots was fired.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Two motorcycle policemen who were in the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. In the motorcade, and one of them throwed his motorcycle\r\ndown right in the middle of the street and ran up the incline with his\r\npistol in his hand, and the other motorcycle policeman jumped over\r\nthe curb with his motorcycle and tried to ride up the hill on his\r\nmotorcycle, and he--tipped over with him up there, and he ran up there\r\nthe rest of the way with his----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you see anything further involving those two?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; I ran around, I was going around the corner of the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. When they were coming up the incline?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. When that happened.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. But, nothing further came of that, that you observed?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you talk to them?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Anything else occur to you?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. No; that is about all of it. If I have been of any help, I\r\nam tickled.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You certainly have. I appreciate very much your coming here\r\ntoday. Our reporter, Mr. Holland, will transcribe your testimony, and\r\nyou then have the opportunity of reviewing it and signing it, or if\r\nyou prefer you can waive your signature and she will send it directly\r\nto the Commission. Either one, it is entirely up to you, whichever you\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. I prefer that he read it and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Fine. Then the reporter will get in touch with you as soon\r\nas his transcript is ready to read.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. I would like to say--now, you will cooperate with the\r\nauthorities in any way?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I surely will.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. To clear this up?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. I sure will.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. And you and have--you and I have been close personal\r\nfriends for over 10 years, haven't we?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. And you wanted me to come down here because you thought\r\nyou would be nervous, and if I were with you maybe you would be less\r\nnervous?\r\n\r\nMr. HOLLAND. That's correct, because I was real nervous when I went\r\nover to that sheriff's office that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. MORRISON. I believe that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF J. W. FOSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of J. W.

Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Come to work here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the police department?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work were you doing in November of 1963, for the\r\nDallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I was working in the traffic division, investigation of\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Investigation of accidents?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have a special assignment on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 1963. And what was that?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. That was assigned to the triple overpass to keep all\r\nunauthorized personnel off of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the overpass, the railroad overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you--the overpass runs in a north-south direction?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you call it the triple overpass, why?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Three streets coming through there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What are they?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Commerce, Main, and Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have a map that I will--just a moment. I will get it.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. All right.\r\n\r\n(Off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me where you were standing on the triple overpass about\r\nthe time that the President's motorcade came into sight?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I was standing approximately along the--I believe the south\r\ncurb of Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir; at the east--be the east side of the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the east side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then was there another officer assigned to that same position?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. He was assigned to the overpass with me; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. J. C. White.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was he?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. He was on the west side of the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were on the east side?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was on the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's go back on the record. Now, we have a map here which we\r\nwill mark as Exhibit A for your deposition.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it shows the railroad overpass running in a north and\r\nsouth direction, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Over that pass come trains into the yard, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that yard is to the north and west of the Texas Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Well, that whole thing, they have yards all over up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In what general direction from the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. They have yards to the north, and some to the south of it\r\ndown below the Terminal.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There are yards south?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. They have yards here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is north and west?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And also south?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you see the President's motorcade come into sight?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you see it? Where was it when you saw it?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. When I first saw it it was coming off of Main Street onto\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you keep it in sight?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir; it was in sight most of the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, where were you standing?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Standing along the east curb of--east side of the overpass\r\nover Elm Street there. About the south curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Over, above the south curb of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you put a mark on there? Mark an \"X\" where you were\r\nstanding and write your initials right next to that \"X\".\r\n\r\nJ.--what are the initials?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. J. W.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. J. W. F. That marks where you were standing.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Approximately; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you keep the President's motorcade in sight after it\r\nturned?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Other than watching the men that were standing on the\r\noverpass there with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you had instructions to keep all unauthorized personnel\r\noff of that overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you permit some people to be there?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. People that were working for the railroad there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there many people?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. About 10 or 11.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were they standing?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. They were standing along the east banister.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The east banister?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir; in front of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In front of you. Will you make a mark there and show the\r\ngeneral area where they were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. They were standing along this area here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have marked a series of X's to show where about 10 people\r\nwere standing?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you looking toward them?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have another officer with you there on that duty that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Not on that side. He was on the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was on the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was his name?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. J. C. White.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know exactly where he was when you were at the\r\nposition you have indicated?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No; I don't. The only thing I know, he was supposed to be\r\non the west side of the banister.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were looking to the east?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, tell me what you saw happen after the President's car\r\npassed--turned onto Elm from Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. After he came onto Elm I was watching the men up on the\r\ntrack more than I was him. Then I heard a loud noise, sound like a\r\nlarge firecracker. Kind of dumbfounded at first, and then heard the\r\nsecond one. I moved to the banister of the overpass to see what was\r\nhappening. Then the third explosion, and they were beginning to move\r\naround. I ran after I saw what was happening.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you see was happening?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Saw the President slump over in the car, and his head\r\nlooked just like it blew up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw that, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Well, at that time I broke and ran around to my right--to\r\nthe left--around to the bookstore.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you have any opinion at that time as to the source\r\nof the sounds, the direction of the sounds?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. It came from back in toward the corner of Elm and Houston\r\nStreets.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was your impression at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was any shot fired from the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anyone with a weapon there?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or did you hear any sound that appeared to come from the\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go from there?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Went on around the back side of the bookstore.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Immediately?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody coming out of that side of the bookstore?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Backside? What do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Well, I guess you would say the northwest side of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any people in the railroad yards around the\r\nbookstore at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir. There was a pretty good crowd beginning to gather\r\nback in that area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you seen anybody over at the railroad yard north and west\r\nof the bookstore before you heard the shots fired?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No; other than people that had come up there and I sent\r\nthem back down the roadway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see. People had attempted to get on the overpass there?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had sent them away?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you got over to the School Book Depository Building,\r\nwhat did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I was standing around in back there to see that no one\r\ncame out, and the sergeant came and got me and we were going to check\r\nthe--all the railroad cars down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was that sergeant?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Sergeant came up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you search the railroad cars?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No; he sent me back down to the inspector. Told me to\r\nreport back to Inspector Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. At the front of the Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to Sawyer there?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell your sergeant or Sawyer, either one where you\r\nthought the shots came from?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you then tell them?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Told them it came from that vicinity up around Elm and\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell the sergeant that first, or did you tell that to\r\nSawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Told that to Inspector Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told that to Sawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell that to the sergeant?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I don't know whether I told the sergeant that or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I moved to--down the roadway there, down to see if I could\r\nfind where any of the shots hit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Find anything?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir. Found where one shot had hit the turf there at\r\nthe location.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Hit the turf?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any marks on the street in any place?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, a manhole cover. It was hit. They caught the manhole\r\ncover right at the corner and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw a mark on a manhole cover did you?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I show you a picture here of a concrete slab, or manhole\r\ncover. Do you recognize that picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does the picture show--tell me what it shows there.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. This looks like the corner here where it penetrated the\r\nturf right here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. See any mark on the manhole cover?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir; I don't. Not on the--well, it is on the turf, on\r\nthe concrete, right in the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you put an arrow showing the approximate place you saw\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Should have been approximately along here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Make it deep enough to make a mark. The arrow marks the\r\nposition that you believe you saw a mark on the pavement?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was not on the manhole cover?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Went into the turf?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you recover any bullet?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, sir. It ricocheted on out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have the crime lab make a picture of that spot?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I called them to the location.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And told them to make a picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. No, I didn't tell them. Called them to the spot and let\r\nthem take it. Can I see the picture?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, sir. Is this the picture?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. That resembles the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I offer this as \"B,\" then. Mark it as \"B\" so that we have \"A\"\r\nand \"B\" now.\r\n\r\nOfficer, this will be written up and submitted to you for your\r\nsignature and you can read it over and change it any way you wish, or\r\nyou may waive your signature at this time, which do you prefer?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Well, it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Suit yourself. You make the choice.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. I would just as soon go ahead and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right. We will notify you and you can get in here and\r\nsign it.\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thank you. One moment, please.\r\n\r\nWho gave you your assignment, Mr. Foster?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Sergeant Harkness.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did permit some railroad employees to remain on the\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you determine they were railroad employees?\r\n\r\nMr. FOSTER. By identification they had with them. Identification they\r\nhad and the other men that was with them verifying that they were\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF J.

We asked Chief Curry\r\nif we could have you come up here and testify, and I guess that is the\r\nreason you are here.\r\n\r\nYou are willing to testify, are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell us whatever you know about it.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, I can ask you.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I will ask you questions.

W. Foster.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Standing on the west side of the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the west side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you with reference to Elm, Main or Commerce as\r\nthey go underneath the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Approximately at the north curb of Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Approximately the north curb of Main on the corner of the\r\nnorth curb of Main? That would be----\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the west side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I'm going to get another copy of this map. Let me see. I can\r\nuse this. Mark this as Exhibit A to your deposition. Now, a diagram\r\nthat was drawn by a patrolman, Joe Murphy, and he has made some marks\r\nand other witnesses have, but don't pay any attention to that. I want\r\nyou to look at this drawing and take a pen and mark your position on\r\nthe railroad overpass in a circle, and put your initials beside it.\r\n\r\nYou have made an \"X\".\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have initialed J. C. White, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Over the--what would be the west curb of Main?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. North curb of Main.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The north curb?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. North curb of Main?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And west side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a rail there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many people were on that overpass that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. On the same side I was on?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. None.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. None? Any people attempt to come up on the overpass around\r\nnoon?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Not on my side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They did not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you seen your partner send any people away from the\r\noverpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You had certain instructions, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were they?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Not to let any unauthorized personnel on top of the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you did permit some people to stay on the overpass,\r\ndidn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Workers of the railroad company.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they people you knew?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, how did you know they were workers with the railroad\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Majority of them were there when we got there, working on\r\nthe rails.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you let them stay there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car come into sight?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir; first time I saw it it has passed, passed under the\r\ntriple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were too far away to see it, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. There was a freight train traveling. There was a train\r\npassing between the location I was standing and the area from which the\r\nprocession was traveling, and--a big long freight train, and I did not\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't see the procession?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Before the train went by, did you see some railroad personnel\r\nover on the--would it be the----\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. East side?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. East side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many people?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. About 10, approximately. I didn't count them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear any shots?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First time you saw the President's car it was going\r\nunderneath?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. As soon as the train passed I went over and on the northwest\r\nside of the Depository Building. On the northwest side of the book\r\nstore up there with the rest of the officers and after about 30 minutes\r\nthey told me to go out and work traffic at Main and Houston, and I\r\nstood out there and worked traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, now, you heard no sound of no rifle fire or\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Freight train was going through at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Making noise?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir; noisy train.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. White, Mr. Foster was on the east side of the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This deposition will be written up and submitted to you for\r\nyour signature if you wish to sign it, or you can waive your signature.\r\nWhich do you wish to do?\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. You said a while ago to him it would be written up like\r\nthis? Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No, it will be written up in the form of a deposition.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITE. I will waive.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You waive it. Okay. Fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOE E. MURPHY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Joe E. Murphy was taken at 9:50 a.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan\r\nand Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthe Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name and address for the record?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Joe E. Murphy, 2509 Winthrop; (spelling) W-i-n-t-h-r-o-p,\r\nDrive.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Police officer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been with the Department?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I am in my 21st year.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With the Dallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you born?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. High school--St. Joseph High School here in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went all through school here in Dallas, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, sir; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you got out of high school?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, I played pro baseball for about 2 years, Class\r\nD--West Texas and New Mexico League. After that I went to work for the\r\nHumble Oil and Refining Co. in Baytown. I was down there about 2 years\r\nand came back to Dallas and then I went to work on the police force.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have been there ever since?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are a patrolman, are you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have a three-wheeler?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. A three-wheeler--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, did they assign you to some post?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, I was assigned to the overpass--the Stemmons Freeway\r\noverpass northbound at Elm Street--over Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What instructions did you have?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. It was to keep anyone and everyone off of the overpass and\r\nto keep traffic moving until the motorcade arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you have a map here which you have drawn for us to show\r\nyour position, is that right? (Reporter marked instrument--Murphy\r\nExhibit A, for identification.)\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have drawn a position there as to where you were\r\nstanding, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where you parked your three-wheeler?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, mark the place where you were standing as Position\r\n1, using an \"X\".\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. All right. (Witness Murphy marked the diagram as requested\r\nby Counsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And your three-wheeler was beside you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; right on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any other officers on that overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; there were two more about--oh, a 100 feet south of\r\nme--to slow traffic or to stop traffic whenever the motorcade entered\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway north entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now where were they located--and, did they as the motorcade\r\ncame down Elm Street, did they go into the highway and stop traffic?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; they did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you put their positions on the Stemmons Freeway overpass\r\nat the time the motorcade came west on Elm, and mark it (2) and (3).\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. (Marked diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know the names of those officers that were (2) and (3)?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I can't recall. I know them but I can't recall who they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they three-wheeler officers too, do they drive\r\nthree-wheelers?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I believe both of them three-wheelers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And as the motorcade came west on Elm, did they stop traffic\r\non Stemmons Freeway?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, their main job was to slow it and let the officers\r\nfarther down the freeway--they would stop it, but traffic approaches\r\npretty fast and they were to slow traffic and let the officers then\r\nstop it. They did--they--they stepped into and were slowing the traffic\r\nas the motorcade came under that railroad overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they ever stop traffic completely?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, it stopped--it stopped itself back down when all the\r\nexcitement--someone down there--they blocked the whole street and then\r\nit backed up, is what it did--backed up to our position.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On Stemmons Freeway?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now Position (1) is where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any people standing on the overpass over Elm, on\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway overpass over Elm, as the motorcade came down?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No; there was no one standing there prior to the arrival of\r\nthe motorcade or after the motorcade arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The only one standing there was you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. It was me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, let's go to the railroad overpass, and first of all, as\r\nyou turned west on Elm from Houston, what is the first overpass that\r\nyou encounter?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. There is a railroad overpass--all of the trains entering\r\nand leaving the Union Station cross over that overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any officers on that overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. There were two.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you mark their positions, approximately, as you saw them\r\nbefore the motorcade arrived?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. As best I could see--one was on each side--one here and one\r\nover on this side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, mark the position of the officer on the west side\r\nas Position (4), and the one on the east side as Position (5).\r\n\r\n(The Witness Murphy marked the diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)\r\nMr. BALL. Were these uniformed officers?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, they were.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know their names?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they have three-wheelers?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No; I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, were there any other people besides the two officers on\r\nthis railroad overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. There were about 8 or 10--from what I could see--about 8\r\nor 10 men dressed in the overalls and they appeared to be railroad\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you mark in their positions, approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, they were in a group right in the center of Elm\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They were all together?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; it appeared that they were in a group (Witness Murphy\r\ndrew circle indicating presence of persons heretofore mentioned as\r\nrequested by Counsel Ball).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have drawn a circle there?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And mark that (6).\r\n\r\n(Witness Murphy marked the diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And in that circle there were about how many?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. 8 to 10 persons.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There were 8 to 10 persons approximately, dressed in overalls?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any other people on the railroad overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you see the motorcade on Houston from your position (1)?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; I could.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President's car turn the corner of Main and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was in your view, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes; it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the corner of Houston and Elm within your view?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Just a portion of it--you lose sight of it there for just a\r\nfew seconds, as it makes the turn. Well, you lose sight of it. There is\r\nsome kind of a--on that part there is a concrete, oh, I don't know what\r\nyou would call it--kind of a framework--it appears to be.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, there is an obstruction to your view?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From where you were standing at Position (1)?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the corner of the intersection of Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to see the President's car after it had turned\r\nwest on Elm from Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, again there, you just get a very short view of it\r\nbefore it goes out of sight then, going down that hill.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard shots, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, from the time you saw the President's car turn north on\r\nHouston from Main and until you heard the shots, what direction were\r\nyou looking?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I was looking in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Toward what?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Toward the motorcade--towards the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you keep the motorcade in sight at all times?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything unusual occur in this group of railroad\r\nmen where you have marked Position (6)?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, I didn't--I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anybody armed there?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, not that I could tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me what direction the policemen were looking who\r\nwere at Position (4) and (5)?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. They appeared to be looking in an easterly direction also.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The direction of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you see other individuals on that railroad overpass\r\nexcept the ones you have described?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, just that group that I have described.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you say you heard something--heard shots?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Describe to me your best recollection as to what you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, I heard--I knew they were shots as soon as I heard\r\nthem, but I thought at first it was--it sounded like a shotgun,\r\nand then I got the three shots and there were so many echoes and\r\neverything--then I did determine it sounded more like a rifle. I do\r\nquite a bit of hunting and I determined it sounded more like a rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Those shots came from what direction?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, just from the direction I was looking--that's all\r\nI could tell. They came from an easterly direction, from where I was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were there echoes?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, quite a few.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the men who were on the overpass at Position (5) do\r\nanything?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I don't recall--on that overpass--right after the shots, I\r\ndid see then a group of people running up the side of this embankment\r\non Elm and running. That would be here--right in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To the north of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. To the north of Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you put an arrow showing the direction they were\r\nrunning and mark that arrow as \"7\"--that's the direction you saw people\r\nrunning?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. (Marked diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.) Yes,\r\nthey were running up in this direction and then in behind this Book\r\nDepository. Oh, I could tell a lot of them were photographers, because\r\nI could see their cameras in their hands and then a number of other\r\npeople, and then I did see some officers also running in that direction.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see what the railroad men did who were at Position\r\n(6) on your map?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No; because right at that time that traffic began backing\r\nup on the freeway and I had turned in to try to keep them moving, but I\r\nfound that I couldn't move them because it was blocked down below me,\r\nnorth of me and there was traffic just stacked up from where the other\r\nofficers had it stopped there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you stay at your position?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, I stayed until, I guess, it was about maybe 3 minutes\r\nafter we heard the shots and then the broadcast came over the radio\r\nthat there had been a shooting--the President had been shot--and then I\r\nwent towards the Book Depository.\r\n\r\nI got on my motor and went towards the Book Depository then--off of\r\nthe freeway; and then was there up around the Book Depository for the\r\nnext--I would say hour or hour and a half at least.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to any witnesses?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. I did pick up or talk to three or four people that said\r\nthey had seen things and said they heard different things, and I took\r\nthem to the sheriff's office across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you knew what their names were?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, sir; I couldn't tell you. I turned them over to the\r\ninvestigators there with the sheriff's department--the district\r\nattorney's investigators, that's who they were.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't make any notes of their names?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember now what any of them told you?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, one man in particular--he was standing on Elm--he\r\nwas standing right about here where we have marked Position (7), and\r\nhe claimed that he heard two shots above him and behind him, and one\r\nshot from up around the edge of this park, and another man claimed that\r\nhe had been standing nearly in this same position--he was standing here\r\non the street and he claimed that all the shots he heard came from\r\noverhead to his rear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be near the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, towards that Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go on the police radio and make any announcement or\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. No, sir; I didn't. It was so jammed, I didn't make any.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I would like to have this marked as Exhibit A to your\r\ndeposition, which is illustrative of your testimony.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as Murphy Exhibit No. A, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This will be written up and you can come in and look it over\r\nand sign it if you wish, or you can waive signature if you wish. It is\r\nyour option--what would you like to do?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, if it's necessary, I will sign it. If it isn't,\r\nthat's perfectly all right with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Well, that's all right then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, you will waive signature?\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thanks very much for coming in.\r\n\r\nMr. MURPHY. All right--certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF ROGER D. CRAIG\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Roger D. Craig was taken at 2:35 p.m., on April 1,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Roger Craig, do you want to stand and raise your right hand,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony that you're about to give is\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can be seated.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you please state your full name?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Roger Dean Craig.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That's (spelling) D-e-a-n?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where do you live, Mr. Craig?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. 6215 Overlook Drive, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what's your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Deputy Sheriff.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For the Dallas County Sheriff's Department?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you, Mr. Craig?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. 27.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you raised here in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. I was born in Wisconsin, raised in Minnesota; and ran\r\naway from home when I was 12 and traveled all over the country.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you were 12?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have any further schooling after you were 12--or not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I took high school equivalent test in the Service\r\nin Japan when--uh--I was 19, and passed it and got my high school\r\nequivalent test--I mean, my diploma.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you in the Service, then?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what branch?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I was in the Army.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And how long were you in the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before you joined the Army, what did you do? Were you living\r\nwith anyone or were you on your own--or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I was married to a girl who lived out in Mesquite.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Mesquite. It's a suburb of Dallas. It's not a town.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nWell, let me go back a little bit. You said you ran away from home when\r\nyou were 12?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then where did you live?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I lived in South Dakota, worked on ranches up there, and\r\nthen Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, with any relatives--or were they friends, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No, no; just jobs. Just working here and there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you were married when you were----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. 16.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 16. And where?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Here in Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Here in Texas.\r\n\r\nAnd then you enlisted in the Army when?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I volunteered for the draft when I was 17.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you went in the Service?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And served overseas?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were discharged when, then?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. In--uh--October of 1955, I believe. In September or October\r\nof 1955, sir, is when I got out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it an honorable discharge?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you were in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I served in the--uh--motor pool of the 92d Armored Field.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And, after you got out of service, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, jobs were kind of hard to get. I got a job as a\r\ndishwasher in a cafe, then cook. Then I did construction work for a\r\nwhile. And then I went to work for the Purex Corporation out on Storey\r\nLane here in Dallas--2929 Storey Lane. Then I worked for them for about\r\n3-1/2 years. Then, I came down to the sheriff's office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, what would your job have been there with the Purex\r\nCorp.?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Packager. I just packaged the Purex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And when did you go to work for the Dallas County Sheriff's\r\nOffice?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. In October--October the 9th of 1959.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And you've been there ever since?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you married?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Family?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; I have a girl and a boy and a stepboy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mr. Craig, I want to take you back to November 22d,\r\n1963, and ask you whether or not you were working at the sheriff's\r\noffice that day?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where is the sheriff's office located?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. 505 Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where is 505 Main Street? Is it on the north or the\r\nsouth side of Main?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It's on the north side of Main at the corner of Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It runs from Houston east to Record Street there? Is that\r\nRecord Street there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; the sheriff's office actually runs north from Main over\r\nto Elm Street. It covers that entire block.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far east does it go--or is it just a half-block east?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; it's just a half block to--uh--well, it's divided, then\r\nthe Records Building begins and goes on to Record Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To Record Street.\r\n\r\nWell, will you state what you did that day from about noon on--on\r\nNovember 22?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I stood out in front waiting for the President's motorcade.\r\nI went out there about--oh--5 minutes after 12, I guess; waited\r\ndirectly in front of the front door on the curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be on the north curb of Main?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, we waited there for several minutes--and--uh--the\r\nmotorcade finally came by.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how fast was the motorcade going when you saw it on\r\nMain Street?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, just barely moving. I don't know. It was just barely\r\nmoving. I couldn't judge any miles per hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, 5, 10, 15, 20--what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Probably going--probably 3 or 4 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nYou saw the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw the motorcade reach the intersection of Main and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then it turned?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Turned north on Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how fast was it going as it turned north on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, about the same. They--uh--they were going about the same\r\nspeed as they made the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were there any motorcycle policemen alongside the\r\nPresident's car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--not directly beside it. They was, I believe, on the\r\nfront part of it and--uh--I believe behind it--just a little ways\r\nbehind the back fender there was a motorcycle officer--one on each side\r\nof the car, as I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The ones on the front--where would the back wheels of\r\nthe motorcycles have been with relation to the front wheels of the\r\nPresident's car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--just in front of the bumper because they came by and\r\nmoved everybody back, you know, as the car approached us.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what about the motorcycles that were just behind the\r\ncar? Where were the front wheels of those motorcycles with relation to\r\nthe back wheels or the back bumper of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. About equal to the back bumper.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nYou saw the President's car, then, turn north on Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then, would you describe what you saw and heard and did?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, there were several other cars that came by and--uh----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you watch those?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Some of them we watched. We watched Mr. Decker's car, of\r\ncourse, and a few of the others.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, where was Mr. Decker's car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I believe he came by just before the President's. I believe\r\nthere were some dignitaries and things before that, and then we watched\r\nthe President's and--uh--oh, and then about two or three cars after\r\nthe President's car had passed. And then we were just standing there\r\nlooking around, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Then I heard an explosion.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you heard the explosion, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, the first--nothing. I wrestled with my mind. I knew\r\nit was a shot but--uh--I didn't want to believe it. But, a few seconds\r\nlater, I heard another explosion and, this time, I knew it was a shot.\r\nAnd, as I began to run, I heard a third one. I was running toward\r\nHouston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many explosions did you hear altogether?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far were these noises apart?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. The first one was--uh--about three seconds--2 or 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Two or 3 seconds between the first and the second?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, it was quite a pause between there. It could have been\r\na little longer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And what about between the second and third?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Not more than 2 seconds. It was--they were real rapid.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I continued running across Houston Street, across the\r\nparkway, across Elm Street and, by this time, the motorcade had went on\r\ndown Elm Street and I ran up to the railroad yard and--uh--started to\r\nlook around when the people began to all travel over that way. So, I\r\nbegan moving people back out of the railroad yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did the noises or shots sound to you like they came\r\nfrom?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It was hard to tell because--uh--they had an echo, you know.\r\nThere was actually two explosions with each one. There was the--uh--the\r\nshot and then the echo from it. So, it was hard to tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did people tell you, as you ran over there, where they\r\nthought the shots came from?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; as I reached the railroad yard, I talked to a girl\r\ngetting her car that--uh--thought they came from the park area on the\r\nnorth side of Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did she say why she thought they came from there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; she was standing there and it sounded real loud at that\r\nparticular point----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And she thought that's where they came from.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did anyone say they had seen anything--such as a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; later on. A few minutes after that--I had taken this\r\ngirl to one of our criminal investigators--and was talking to some\r\nother people. I talked to a young couple and the boy said he saw two\r\nmen on the--uh--sixth floor of the Book Depository Building over there;\r\none of them had a rifle with the telescopic sight on it--but he thought\r\nthey were Secret Service agents on guard and didn't report it. This was\r\nabout--uh--oh, he said, 15 minutes before the motorcade ever arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if that boy's name would have been Arnold\r\nRowland--(spelling) R-o-w-l-a-n-d?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Does that sound like it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; it sounds like the name--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. His wife might be Barbara Rowland?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; I believe her name was Barbara.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before you talked to this couple, did you do anything else\r\nor talk with anyone before you got back with them?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I looked around, you know, for just--after I turned\r\nthis girl over to Mr. Lewis--I began looking around and talking to\r\npeople to see if they'd seen anything. And that's when I ran onto this\r\nman and his wife.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And about what time do you think this was in relation\r\nto--from when you heard the shots to the time that you talked to this\r\nyoung couple?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I don't know. 10 minutes, maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You believe you talked to this young couple 10 minutes after\r\nthe shots were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It might have been 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen, what did you do? But, first of all, let me ask you this: Did this\r\ngirl say that she saw any person with a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, the boy--where did he say that he saw the man with the\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. On the--uh--west end of the building on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that be--when you say \"the west end,\"--you mean, the\r\nwest end of the south side, or the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. The west end of the south side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he point out the window to you?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the west corner, where would this window have been?\r\nRight next to the west corner or two or three windows away, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It was the--uh--the second window from the corner.\r\n\r\nThey were walking, you know, back and forth.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He said that the two men were walking back and forth?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, when you talk about second window, this building is\r\nlocated near you, is it not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This is the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Each window was sort of a pair of windows. And, on the south\r\nside, there probably are around seven pairs of windows.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this have been--when you say \"the second window from\r\nthe west end\"--by that do you mean it was the first pair of windows but\r\nthe easternmost one of that pair, or do you mean it was in the second\r\npair of windows from the west end--or don't you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't remember that now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nDid he say anything else about what he had seen with this man with the\r\nrifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yeah; he said he looked back a few minutes later\r\nand--uh--the other man was gone, and there was just one man--the man\r\nwith the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He said he looked back again and just the man with the rifle\r\nwas there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say how long or when the last time was that he saw\r\nthe man with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I believe this second time he looked was the--uh--the last\r\ntime he looked up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And about how long was that before the shots were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, he said he first seen him--saw the two men about 15\r\nminutes before the motorcade arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And he didn't say how long after that he looked back up\r\nthere to just see the one man. He just said--uh--a few minutes later he\r\nlooked back up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A few minutes later, he looked back up and he saw one man\r\nwith the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Just the one man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say what the one man was doing with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. He said he was holding it down to his side and just looking\r\nout the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say how far the man was from the window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; huh-uh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say in what direction the man was looking out the\r\nwindow?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. He was looking out in a southerly direction. Straight ahead.\r\nYou know, straight out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When he said the man was holding it at his side, would\r\nthis be--did he say it was, in military terminology, in any kind of a\r\nposition to hold a weapon?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; this I don't go into with him. I turned him over to\r\nOfficer Lewis for interrogation.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this be Deputy Sheriff Lemmy Lewis--(spelling)\r\nL-e-m-m-y L-e-w-i-s?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He is a criminal investigator of the Dallas Sheriff's Office?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then you left this young couple?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, about how long would this have been after the shooting\r\nthat you left them with Deputy Sheriff Lewis?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I didn't talk with them long. I talked with them--all\r\nthe time that he told me what he saw and the time that I turned him\r\nover to officer Lewis, was probably--uh--3 minutes--3 or 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Because--uh--I took him immediately up there to him when he\r\ntold me what he'd seen.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By this time, had anyone said the shots might have come from\r\nthat School Book Depository Building--do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. I don't--uh--I don't recall that. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At this time, do you know whether or not they had sealed off\r\nin any way the entrance or the building--the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding--or not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; no. I didn't notice that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You didn't notice that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, about how many minutes after the\r\nassassination or shooting was it that you turned this couple over to\r\nSheriff Lemmy Lewis?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, it was about--well, I guess, 12 minutes--10, 12 minutes.\r\nSomething like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Ten or 12 minutes after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I looked around for a little bit, you know, just\r\nobserving the people and things, and Officer Lewis turned them over to\r\nsomeone else, as I recall, and sent them to the sheriff's office--to\r\nMr. Decker's office. And then it was either Lemmy Lewis or Buddy\r\nWalthers--(spelling) W-a-l-t-h-e-r-s, one of our other criminal\r\ninvestigators, said that one of the bullets had ricocheted off the\r\nsouth curb of Elm Street. So, Officer Lewis and I crossed--walked down\r\nthe hill and crossed Elm Street to look for the place where the bullet\r\nmight have hit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say why he believed one of the bullets ricocheted off\r\nthe south curb of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; he just said that someone said that one of them had. So,\r\nwe checked it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So, you searched the south curb of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you find anything there to indicate the ricocheted\r\nbullet?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; we didn't find anything at that time. Now, as we were\r\nsearching, we had just got over across the street, when I heard someone\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, about how many minutes was this after the time that you\r\nhad turned that young couple over to Lemmy Lewis that you heard this\r\nwhistle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Fourteen or 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Fourteen or 15 minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was this, you mean, after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. After the--from the time I heard the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nYou heard someone whistle?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes. So I turned and--uh--saw a man start to run down the\r\nhill on the north side of Elm Street, running down toward Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And, about where was he with relation to the School Book\r\nDepository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--directly across that little side street that runs in\r\nfront of it. He was on the south side of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And he was on the south side of what would be an extension\r\nof Elm Street, if Elm Street didn't curve down into the underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right; right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where was he with relation to the west side of the\r\nSchool Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right by the--uh--well, actually, directly in line with the\r\nwest corner--the southwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was directly in line with the southwest corner of the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And he was on the south curve of that street that runs right\r\nin front of the building there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And he started to run toward Elm Street as it curves under\r\nthe underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; directly down the grassy portion of the park.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nAnd then what did you see happen?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I saw a light-colored station wagon, driving real slow,\r\ncoming west on Elm Street from Houston. Uh--actually, it was nearly in\r\nline with him. And the driver was leaning to his right looking up the\r\nhill at the man running down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And the station wagon stopped almost directly across from\r\nme. And--uh--the man continued down the hill and got in the station\r\nwagon. And I attempted to cross the street. I wanted to talk to both\r\nof them. But the--uh--traffic was so heavy I couldn't get across the\r\nstreet. And--uh--they were gone before I could----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did the station wagon head?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. West on Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Under the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you describe the man that you saw running down toward\r\nthe station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, he was a white male in his twenties, five nine, five\r\neight, something like that; about 140 to 150; had kind of medium brown\r\nsandy hair--you know, it was like it'd been blown--you know, he'd been\r\nin the wind or something--it was all wild-looking; had on--uh--blue\r\ntrousers----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What shade of blue? Dark blue, medium or light?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; medium, probably; I'd say medium.\r\n\r\nAnd, a--uh--light tan shirt, as I remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else about him?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; nothing except that he looked like he was in an awful\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the man who was driving the car?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Now, he struck me, at first, as being a colored male. He\r\nwas very dark complected, had real dark short hair, and was wearing a\r\nthin white-looking jacket--uh, it looked like the short windbreaker\r\ntype, you know, because it was real thin and had the collar that came\r\nout over the shoulder (indicating with hands) like that--just a short\r\njacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say that he first struck you that way. Do you now think\r\nthat he was a Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I don't--I didn't get a real good look at him. But my\r\nfirst glance at him--I was more interested in the man coming down the\r\nhill--but my first glance at him, he struck me as a Negro.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what your opinion is today?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I--I couldn't say, because I didn't get a good enough\r\nlook at him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind and what color station wagon was it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It was light colored--almost--uh--it looked white to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What model or make was it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I thought it was a Nash.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why would you think it was a Nash?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Because it had a built-in luggage rack on the top.\r\nAnd--uh--at the time, this was the only type car I could fit with that\r\ntype luggage rack.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A Nash Rambler--is that what you're referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; with a rack on the the back portion of the car, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it have a Texas license plate, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It had the same color. I couldn't see the--uh--name with the\r\nnumbers on it. I could just barely make them out. They were at an angle\r\nwhere I couldn't make the numbers of the--uh--any of the writing on it.\r\nBut--uh--I'm sure it was a Texas plate.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else about this incident that you can recall?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; not that----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, then--uh, I went back up to the front of the School\r\nBook Depository--rather, I went up to it and noticed that it was sealed\r\noff. There was an officer standing guard in it with a shotgun in the\r\ndoorway; several officers crowded around in front of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long would this have been after the shots were fired?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I'd say nearly 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And they were calling for hand lights to search the attic of\r\nthe building. At that time--uh--they thought the man was still in the\r\nbuilding. So, they were calling for hand lights to search the building.\r\n\r\nSo, I went back across to the sheriff's office and got some hand lights\r\nand took them back over to them.\r\n\r\nThen, I went up on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why did you go up on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, someone said that's where the shots came from. One of\r\nthe city officers, if I'm not mistaken.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. So, we went to the sixth floor where--uh--some empty\r\ncartridges were found.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the empty cartridges when they were found?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I didn't see them when they were found. I saw them laying on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how soon after they were found did you see them laying\r\non the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, a couple of minutes. I went right on over there. I\r\nwas at the far north end of the building. The cartridges were on the\r\nsoutheast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, how did you know they had been found there? Did\r\nsomeone yell--or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; someone yelled across the room that \"here's the shells.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember who that was?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I couldn't recognize the voice.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Then, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I went over there and--uh--didn't get too close because the\r\nshells were laying on the ground and there was--uh--oh, a sack and a\r\nbunch of things laying over there. So, you know, not to bother the\r\narea, I just went back across.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you say, there was a sack laying there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; I believe it was laying on top of a box, if I'm not\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How big a sack was that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It was a paper bag (indicating with hands)--a small paper\r\nbag.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, the kind of paper bag that you carry your lunch in?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yeah,--uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it more than a foot long?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I don't know. I think it was rolled up kind of.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You think it was rolled up?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yeah; you know, kind of crushed up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there any long sack laying in the floor there that you\r\nremember seeing, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't remember seeing any.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember seeing any thing there other than the shells?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; not--uh--not anything that caught my eye.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where do you remember seeing the shells?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. They were laying on the--uh--well, as you're facing the\r\nwindow----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you are facing the window and you're looking south?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. The southeast corner window and you're looking south, the\r\nshells would be on your right and back away from the window, as I\r\nrecall, about a foot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you recall any of the shells right up against the wall at\r\nall--or, don't you recall?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't; I didn't look that close.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shells did you see there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I saw three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did anyone move any boxes in order to get in there--do you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Now, that, I don't know?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know if anyone moved any boxes in the window?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. That I don't know either.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look very closely at the area where the shells were\r\nfound?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--no, because the identification men hadn't arrived, and\r\nwe didn't want to stir up anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was there that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, Officer Mooney with our department--Luke Mooney; Officer\r\nBoone--Eugene Boone, with our department; myself; and some city\r\nofficers that I didn't know. Those are the only that I remember. You\r\nknow, there were several other people around but I didn't know them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. They wanted to search the building for the weapon, so I went\r\nto the--I went to the northeast corner of the building and began to\r\nsearch west.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--everybody else took a different spot. And as I got\r\nnearly to the west end of the building, Officer Boone--Eugene Boone\r\nwith the sheriff's office--hollered that here was the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far were you from Officer Boone when he hollered?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. About 8-foot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I went over to the--uh--cluster of boxes where he was\r\nstanding and looked down between the boxes and saw the rifle lying on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say \"between the cluster of boxes,\" could you\r\ndescribe which way the boxes were?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. There was a row going east to west on the north side of the\r\nweapon, and a box going east to west on the south side of the weapon,\r\nand--uh--if I remember, uh--as you'd look down, you had to look kinda\r\nback under the north stack of boxes to see the rifle. It was pushed\r\nkinda under--uh--or up tight against 'em--you know, where it would be\r\nhard to see. And, of course, both ends of the rows were closed off\r\nwhere you couldn't see through 'em. You had to get up and look in 'em.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are gesturing with your hand there--would you say that\r\nthe boxes, then, as you gestured, were in the shape of what I would\r\ncall a rectangular \"O\", so to speak?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes, yes, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And about how high were the walls of this enclosure, so to\r\nspeak?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, it--it was different heights. Now, the part where I\r\nlooked in particularly was about--uh--oh, was about 5-foot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nAnd you gestured there in such a way that you had to lean over and look\r\nstraight down? Would that be a fair statement of your gestures?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; yes. You had to lean over the boxes and look down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what happened? After you found this, did people come over--or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; several other people came over.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember about what time this was?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I had no idea then how long it had been.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nDo you remember who else came over?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, Officer Mooney and--uh--several of the city officers;\r\nWill Fritz came over--Capt. Will Fritz, with the city of Dallas; some\r\nof his investigators, I didn't know them; and a criminal identification\r\nman, I believe, from the city of Dallas, then came over there to take\r\npictures of the weapon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The weapon was moved by the time the pictures were taken?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; no. The pictures were taken as the weapon was found\r\nlying there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the pictures taken of the shells?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know whether or not anything was moved in that\r\nwindow before this?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nAnything else happen up to that time that you haven't related here that\r\nyou feel might be important?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. Uh--I'm thinking it was about this time--uh--that we got\r\nthe news there had been a city officer shot over in Oak Cliff.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, there was just--uh--of course, everybody stayed\r\nthere, you know, and sort of mingled around and--uh--I then went back\r\ndownstairs after the weapon was picked up. The identification man from\r\nthe city of Dallas then, after he took his pictures, picked the weapon\r\nup and handed it to Will Fritz.\r\n\r\nAnd I then went back downstairs and over to the sheriff's office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nAt this time, do you know, did any person say that any employee in the\r\nSchool Building was missing up until the time you left?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't recall anybody saying anything to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had any description gone out for anyone that you know of\r\nwith regard to the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I think--uh--no description of the suspect in the shooting\r\nof the officer hadn't went out at this time, but----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know of any other that went out at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Then you went back over to the Dallas Sheriff's\r\nOffice?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, I think I gave a statement to Rosemary Allen over\r\nthere, as did all the officers, as to what they were doing at the time,\r\nyou know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And--uh--then I kept thinking about this man that had run\r\ndown the hill and got in this car, so--uh--it was about, oh, I don't\r\nrecall exactly the time, nearly 5 or something like that, or after,\r\nwhen--uh--the city had apprehended a suspect in the city officer's\r\nshooting. And--uh--information was floating around that they were\r\ntrying to connect him with the assassination of the President--as the\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\nSo--uh, in the meantime, I kept thinking about this subject that had\r\nrun and got in the car. So, I called Captain Fritz' office and talked\r\nto one of his officers and--uh--told him what I had saw and give him a\r\ndescription of the man, asked him how it fit the man they had picked up\r\nas a suspect.\r\n\r\nAnd--uh--it was then they asked me to come up and look at him at\r\nCaptain Fritz' office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I drove up to Fritz' office about, oh, after 5--about 5:30\r\nor something like that--and--uh--talked to Captain Fritz and told him\r\nwhat I had saw. And he took me in his office--I believe it was his\r\noffice--it was a little office, and had the suspect setting in a chair\r\nbehind a desk--beside the desk. And another gentleman, I didn't know\r\nhim, he was sitting in another chair to my left as I walked in the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Fritz asked me was this the man I saw--and I said, \"Yes,\"\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nWill you describe the man you saw in Captain Fritz' office?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Oh, he was sitting down but--uh--he had the same medium\r\nbrown hair; it was still--well, it was kinda wild looking; he\r\nwas slender, and--uh--what I could tell of him sitting there, he\r\nwas--uh--short. By that, I mean not--myself, I'm five eleven--he was\r\nshorter than I was. And--uh--fairly light build.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see his trousers?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I couldn't see his trousers at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about his shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I believe, as close as I can remember, a T-shirt--a white\r\nT-shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nBut you didn't see him in a lineup? You just saw him sitting there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; he was sitting there by himself in a chair--off to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nThen, what did Captain Fritz say and what did you say and what did the\r\nsuspect say?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Captain Fritz then asked him about the--uh--he said, \"What\r\nabout this station wagon?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the suspect interrupted him and said, \"That station wagon belongs\r\nto Mrs. Paine\"--I believe is what he said. \"Don't try to tie her into\r\nthis. She had nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd--uh--Captain Fritz then told him, as close as I can remember, that,\r\n\"All we're trying to do is find out what happened, and this man saw you\r\nleave from the scene.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the suspect again interrupted Captain Fritz and said, \"I told you\r\npeople I did.\" And--uh--yeah--then, he said--then he continued and he\r\nsaid, \"Everybody will know who I am now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was leaning over the desk. At this time, he had risen partially\r\nout of the chair and leaning over the desk, looking directly at Captain\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was he wearing--or could you see the color of his\r\ntrousers as he leaned over the desk?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; because he never--he just leaned up, you know, sort of\r\nforward--not actually up, just out of his chair like that (indicating)\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then, did you say anything more?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I then left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, in other words, the only thing you ever said was,\r\n\"This was the man,\"--or words to that effect?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Captain Fritz say anything more.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't believe--not while I was there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the suspect say anything more?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you say anything about that it was a Rambler station\r\nwagon there?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. In the presence of the suspect?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know whether Captain Fritz said anything to the\r\nsuspect about this incident before you came, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can think of involving this\r\ninterrogation at which you were present?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. Nothing else was said after that point. I then left and\r\ngive my name to the--uh--Secret Service agent and the FBI agent that\r\nwas outside the office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else in connection with the assassination that you\r\nthink might be important that we haven't discussed here?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; except--uh--except for the fact that it came out later\r\nthat Mrs. Paine does own a station wagon and--uh--it has a luggage\r\nrack on top. And this came out, of course, later, after I got back to\r\nthe office. I didn't know about this. Buddy Walthers brought it up. I\r\nbelieve they went by the house and the car was parked in the driveway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. That's all. I forgot about it and went back to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, prior to the time we had your deposition taken, we\r\nchatted for a few minutes about some of these things--is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For instance, we talked about your conversation with this\r\nyoung couple--this Arnold Rowland and his wife?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything that we said before the deposition was\r\ntaken that we haven't recorded here?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything that I said or you said in our\r\nconversation that is different from anything that was recorded here--to\r\nthe best of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; except you asked me before, I believe, did I talk to any\r\nof the railroad employees.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. And I said, \"No\"--which I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. (Pausing before reply.) No--nothing that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In our conversation, did you just relate to me what your\r\nstory was before we sat down to take the deposition?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you agree to follow or to waive signing of the\r\ndeposition and leave it in the Court Reporter's hands--or do you want\r\nto sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It makes no difference to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the way, you had notice of this, did you not, of this\r\ntaking of this deposition?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes. I have the letter right here in my pocket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nAnything else you can think of, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we want to thank you for taking your time to come down\r\nhere and we appreciate your cooperation. We would appreciate your,\r\nalso, thanking Sheriff Decker for us, if you would, when you get back\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nOne other thing before you go, Mr. Craig. We might have covered this\r\nbefore, but I want to doublecheck it.\r\n\r\nWhen you talked to Mr. Rowland about what he saw in the window, did he\r\nsay whether or not two men he saw were white or colored?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; I determined that right away. I asked him whether they\r\nwere white or colored and he said white.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What else did he tell you about them? Did he tell you how\r\nmuch of them he saw?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes. He said they--uh--walked back and forth in front of the\r\nwindows there--uh--several minutes. You know, not a long time but 3, 4,\r\n5 minutes. He did state that one of them had a rifle with a scope on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he give you the color of the hair or the complexion or\r\nanything like that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No--no; this he couldn't give.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could he give you the type of clothing they were wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. If I recall, he was vague on one--he thought it was khakis,\r\nbut the other man he wasn't sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell you anything else about these people?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; he said he looked up a few minutes later and--uh--there\r\nwas only one man up there then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever tell you anything about seeing any other people\r\nin any other windows?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; he said there were people in other windows looking over\r\nthe ledges--you know, leaning up against the outside of the windows,\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell you whether any of these other people were on\r\nthe sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; these two men were the only ones he saw on that\r\nparticular floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell you that was the sixth floor he saw them on?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes. He said the second to the top floor--the next floor\r\ndown; which would be the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell you about ever seeing anyone else on the sixth\r\nfloor--or did he say that he didn't see anyone else on the sixth floor?\r\nOr don't you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Just the two men. That's all he saw on that particular floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you specifically ask him if he saw anyone else on that\r\nfloor, or did he say that he did not?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I asked him and he said----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, what was your statement to him and what was his to you?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. I asked him was there anybody else on the floor with these\r\ntwo men. And he said, \"No, just the two of them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say that he saw these two men together first?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then he just saw one, as I understand it?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. A few minutes later, he looked back up there and saw just\r\nthe man with the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I believe he said earlier that he saw these men around 15\r\nminutes before the motorcade arrived? And then a few minutes later, you\r\nsay that he told you he saw only one man?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he then tell you that he saw no men--or what did he say\r\nabout what he saw after that?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, then, I took him to Officer Lewis and turned him over\r\nto Lemmy Lewis.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of about that conversation?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; there was not--I don't think there was anything else\r\ndiscussed except for the fact that he told me he thought--he said he\r\nthought he was a Secret Service agent--and that's why he didn't report\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, if you would just wait here one more minute, Mr. Craig, Mr. Ball\r\nstepped in and he's going down to pick up some clothing. And we'd\r\nlike to have you take a look at this clothing and see if this looks\r\nfamiliar to any of the clothing that you saw on the man running toward\r\nthe Rambler.\r\n\r\nIf you'll just wait a minute here please sir.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Ball returns to deposition room with box of clothing.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Craig, I hand you Exhibit No. 150. Have you ever seen a\r\nshirt like this before? Does this look familiar to the shirt that the\r\nsuspect might have been wearing when you saw him, or this man running\r\ntoward the station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. It's the same type of shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I believe you used the phrase, \"light shirt\". Would Exhibit\r\n150 be darker than the shirt that he was wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Uh--it looks darker in here--yes, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was this man running towards the station wagon wearing a\r\njacket?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I don't believe he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I hand you Exhibit No. 156. Did the trousers that this man\r\nrunning toward the station wagon had on--were they this color--lighter,\r\ndarker, or a different kind of trousers--or what?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No. They were--uh--they were work trousers like those; but\r\nthey looked blue to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And this Exhibit 156 looks kind of gray?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about Exhibit 157?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, those are more the color.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But they still looked different from Exhibit 157, too?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you discussed with Sheriff Decker the fact that when\r\nOswald was picked up they found a bus transfer in his pocket?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. No; I knew--uh--nothing about a bus transfer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you feel, in your own mind, that the man you saw at\r\nCaptain Fritz's office was the same man that you saw running towards\r\nthe station wagon?\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Yes; I feel like it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you feel that you might have been influenced by the fact\r\nthat you knew he was the suspect--subconsciously, or do you----\r\n\r\nMr. CRAIG. Well, it's--it's possible, but I still feel strongly that it\r\nwas the same person.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Okay. That's it. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF GEORGE W. RACKLEY, SR.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of George W. Rackley, Sr., was taken at 11 a.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W.

We do a lot of farming up there.\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. That is what I do here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, at the present I am working for the Coordinated\r\nRailroad Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For the what?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. For the Katy. It is a Katy railroad project, but it is a\r\ncoordinated deal.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What are you doing?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I unload trailers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You unload trailers?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me backtrack. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I am 60.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said you quit school in the Fifth Grade and went to\r\nfarming. How long did you farm?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I farmed up to 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You farmed up to 3 years ago?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of farming?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I raised cotton and corn.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then 3 years ago where did you go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I went to work here. Well, I have been working off in\r\nspare times for about 8 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For the same place?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes; same place.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. That is here in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where in Dallas is it?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. It is on Ross and Market Street, about two blocks from the\r\ncourthouse.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now where is it with relation to the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, it is on up on Ross. Two blocks north is where our\r\nplace is.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your place is two blocks north of the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You work indoors or outdoors?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Just all over town.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Just all over town?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you working around the noon hour of Friday,\r\nNovember 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I was there at the office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you inside or outside?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Our office is just a little small place. Well, just\r\noutside, you might say, of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the President's motorcade at all on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you standing with anyone there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. With whom?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. With James Romack. I and him had walked out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had walked out?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I heard the siren; the parade was coming.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You heard sirens?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir. And I had walked out in front of the place to\r\nwhere I could get a better view, as a fellow says.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you standing?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I had walked out in the truck lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the truck lot?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And was that----\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. You might say would have been in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that have been in the middle of Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what direction were you facing?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Facing south.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, did you see the motorcade at all?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I didn't practically see anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear any sounds at all?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes. Heard the sounds of the parade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear the sounds that sounded like firecrackers or\r\nshots at all?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Didn't hear that?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far would you have been from the northeast corner\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository when you were standing there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I would say right at a block.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About a block. Do you have any idea about how many feet that\r\nis?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you just standing there, or were you walking?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I was just standing there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything happen at all there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone in the parade?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. The only thing--I told the guy, he was down there, the\r\nonly thing that I saw that looked suspicious to me, there was something\r\nlike a hundred pigeons flew up like you shot into them, and I noticed\r\nthat, but I never heard no shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see them fly from?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. From over the top of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which building? The School Book Depository or over on the\r\nother side?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. The Trinity Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which building did they fly off of?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I wasn't looking. I just seen they all flew together.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it look like they were flying up from both buildings?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Both buildings.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know about when this took place?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time was it that you were looking that way, do\r\nyou remember, offhand?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No; but it was just at the time that the parade was\r\nnearing there, I know that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had any of the parade already gone by the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you don't know whether it did or didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But would you say it was about that time that the motorcade\r\nwas to be going by there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. It was between 11 and 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was between 11 and 12?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. O'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What time did you--was this before or after you had lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I just eat just any time I get a chance.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know accurately what time it was?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could it have been as late as 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was before 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before 12?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sometime between 11 and 12?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, it was at the time that, really, that they had shot\r\nhim, because I was there when the policemen covered the place.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were there when the policemen covered the place?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. With relation to the time that the policemen covered the\r\nplace, how many minutes before that did you see the birds fly up?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I saw the pigeons there 2 or 3 minutes before that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now after you saw the pigeons, you saw the police covering\r\nthe place?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Within 2 or 3 minutes after you saw the pigeons?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any people coming out the back door at all?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see the back door of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That was at the dock they have back there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you looking towards that direction?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how long did you keep your eyes fixed over there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Oh, I would say 5 minutes anyhow. Probably 10. I was\r\nlooking up that way at all times.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Five or 10 minutes, you figure?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any people leave the Texas School Book\r\nDepository by way of the rear exit?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any people running north on Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you tell your company supervisor that there had been\r\nsome shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. No; not right then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Later did you tell them?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes; I imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said you stayed there 5 or 10 minutes looking to the\r\nsouth?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, when the policemen began to crowd around and they\r\nall over the place, well then I told him I thought that something had\r\nhappened over there.\r\n\r\nI wasn't expecting anything like that until I just, of course, seen the\r\npolicemen all out there running back. They came out the back door and\r\nthe side door with guns.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who did you tell that to that you thought something happened\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Gail George.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that your foreman?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After you said you kept your eyes on this looking south for\r\n5 or 10 minutes, what did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I went back to the office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Well, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. During this period of 5 or 10 minutes, did you walk close to\r\nthe building at all, or just stand there?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Just stood out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about Romack? Did he stand with you, or did he walk\r\ncloser?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. He walked closer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of, whether I have asked it or\r\nnot, that in any way might be relevant to this inquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. It wasn't a thing that I knew. I didn't really know or\r\nexpect what was taking place.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Other than the pigeons?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sir, we thank you for your cooperation. You have a right, if\r\nyou want, to come back down and read your testimony and sign it, or you\r\ncan just waive doing that and have the court reporter send it directly\r\nto us without your taking another trip down here. You can do it either\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I can sign it now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can either waive signing it or else you can come down\r\nagain and read it and sign it. By waiving, I mean you just let it go,\r\nassuming that the court reporter will accurately transcribe it, or you\r\nhave a right to come in and read it.\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. I will just let it go.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You waive signing it?\r\n\r\nMr. RACKLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is all for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JAMES ELBERT ROMACK\r\n\r\nThe testimony of James Elbert Romack was taken at 11:30 a.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W.

I take it back, I was going to Tech when the war broke out,\r\nand went to East Texas State after the war.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When the war broke out, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK.

We\r\nwere in the, I forget the name, we were riding typhoons. We rode out\r\neight of them, and our ship came back without the two side doors. All\r\nwe had was the big ramp.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That must have been quite a voyage back?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. They were taking water in the port and bailing it over in\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got back to the States, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Went to St. Louis and bought me an automobile, and just I\r\nwas a boy. I was the boy about 6 months, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Then I entered school, East Texas State Teachers College.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went there about a year?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Approximately a year, I would say, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I got married once along the route, and I was married about\r\n30 days.\r\n\r\nThen I came to Dallas in 1947. I guess it was 1947, or 1948, I forget\r\njust when I did come to Dallas. It was along in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And you have been in Dallas ever since?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the way, were you honorably discharged?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes; I surely was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I went to work with a motor freight carrier. They are known\r\nas ICX today. They were Miller & Miller Motor Freight at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do for them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Drove a truck.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Approximately a year.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Went back to East Texas, and my home, and piddled around\r\nfor a short while.\r\n\r\nThen I came back to Dallas. And what did I do along in there? In 1949,\r\nI went to work for the Cotton Belt Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay with them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Until April, I believe, of 1955. I know it was in 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you generally do when you were with the Cotton Belt?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I did all the railroad work during that time. I mean, I\r\nhave been a billing clerk, and I have been a foreman, and I have been\r\nchecker, and assistant foreman, warehouse foreman, and I worked out in\r\nthe yards, and did quite a few jobs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You left them in 1955, and then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Went to work with--a friend wanted me to go to work with\r\nhim in a service station, Conoco Service Station.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay there?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Stayed there a year, approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Then I went to work with Strickland Transportation Co. as a\r\ndock foreman.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long were you with them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Oh, I would say 6 or 7 months.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Then I went to work with an air freight concern out here at\r\nLove Field Drive, driving a truck, delivering air freight and picking\r\nup air freight for, I would say, 7 or 8 months there, maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Then I hired out with the Coordinating Transportation Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Coordinated Transportation Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right, which that is where I am at today.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What have you been doing for them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Driving mostly your big van trailer-truck and bobtail\r\ntrucks and pickup and delivery service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you around the noon hour of November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I was on lunch period, just piddling around out north by\r\neast, I would say, from the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were standing around Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It would be just about where Houston would intersect, but\r\nthe street was under construction at the time. They didn't have it,\r\nwhich they still don't have it opened up for through traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you standing with anyone?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, Lee and Mr. Rackley, we walked out there together\r\noriginally to start with. We were kind of piddling around, and I kind\r\nof walked off ahead of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that George W. Rackley you were referring to?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is he also known as \"Pop\" Rackley?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said you started walking away. Where did you walk?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Toward the School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Along what street did you walk?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, it wouldn't be no street at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, if there would be a street?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I guess it would be just about, I don't know whether they\r\nare going to split Ross and Houston Street up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you be looking at at Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. More or less. I would be looking at Houston Street; yes,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, and what happened as you were walking?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I heard these three rifle shots sound out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you know they were rifle shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir; I did. I go elk hunting in Colorado every year in\r\nOctober, and I just came back from this trip, and I am pretty familiar\r\nwith a rifle shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did they sound like they came from?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It sounded, I guess, like it came from that building, but\r\nit wasn't on my side of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it sound like it was up high or low?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I would say they were high. I have never been asked that\r\nquestion, but it did sound like they were running out high, I would\r\nsay, and the wind was blowing a little bit from the south that day, I\r\ncan remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The wind was blowing into your face as you walked, or was it\r\nblowing from your back, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It was blowing into my face.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Into your face.\r\n\r\nHow far were you from the School Book Depository Building when you\r\nheard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Oh, I probably was 125 yards. 100 to 125 yards, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that be from the nearest corner of the building or\r\nfrom the front of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. From the nearest corner of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the northeast corner of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How close did the shots sound like they came together?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Oh, they happened pretty fast. I would say maybe 3 or 4\r\nseconds apart.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were they equally spaced, or did one sound like it was\r\ncloser than another one in time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It sounded like to me that they were evenly spaced. They\r\nrang out pretty fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you ever operated a bolt action rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you own one?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it sound like the shots were faster than it could be\r\noperated with a bolt action rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of rifle do you have now, by the way?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I have a--it is a--I can't answer that really.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What caliber?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It is a 30-06.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 30-06 rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, it is. And it is an old World War I mechanism. It is\r\neither an Enfleld or a Springfield.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Bolt action?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You heard those rifle shots, and you think you could shoot\r\nyour rifle accurately as fast as you heard those shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I don't, wouldn't think that I would be that good a shot;\r\nno, sir; because I shot at an elk four times and I hit him everywhere\r\nand missed him one time out of four.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far was it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. He was, I would say, 350 to 500 yards away. He was quite a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Maybe I should have asked the question this way. Suppose he\r\nwas 100 yards away or else 50 yards?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I would be more accurate with my shooting, I sure would.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If he were, say, from 40 to 75 yards away, or not an elk, a\r\nperson, do you think you could shoot 40 to 75 yards away accurately as\r\nquickly as you heard those rifle sounds?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I wouldn't say I could; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you think an accurate rifleman could?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you heard the shots, and then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, I knew something was wrong. I mean, I could sense\r\nthat within my own self.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. And I looked up and I felt kind of chilly looking down\r\ntowards the--which I am facing the Houston entrance, and I looked\r\ndown toward where all the people were standing along, the motorcade\r\nwas passing by, and just immediately after I heard the shots, I saw a\r\npoliceman running north towards me. He was running to look to see if\r\nsomebody was running out of the back of this building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Texas School Book Depository Building. And he didn't stay\r\nbut just, oh, he was just there to check and he runs back.\r\n\r\nWell, sensing that something is wrong, I automatically take over\r\nwatching the building for the man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What part of the building were you watching?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. The back part.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see that back dock in the back part?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, I mean, they got it sealed off. I could see as much\r\nas anyone could see.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you see--there are some stairs that go up to the back\r\ndock, aren't there?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are pointing to a first floor plan of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you watch those stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you watch them after you saw the policeman\r\nleave?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, I watched them all the time until someone arrived,\r\nand the only time I did take my back off, turn my back to the building\r\nwas Sam Pate with his KBOX news, he arrived before any of the police or\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that KBOX?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that a radio or television station?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It is a radio station.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you take your eyes off then?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. He was driving up and they were having a little high--the\r\ncity has a piece of wood that they use to stop traffic coming through,\r\nand I'd taken that so he could come through, drive his truck.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you leave your post?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I didn't leave. That was right there, even closer than what\r\nwe were. But all I did was let that down for him, and then we----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that have taken less than a minute?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Less than 30 seconds, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay after that watching that back door?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, we were all there watching it then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long a period of time?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see a policeman go up there?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I saw policemen up in there. I didn't see anyone come up\r\nthe back. They came in the front, all--most of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any employees walk up the back way?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. There was two other gentlemen which I never said anything\r\nabout, that taken over. They were FBI or something standing right here\r\nat the very entrance, and just stood there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are pointing again to the back stairway that leads up\r\nfrom the street to the dock on the north side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. See anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir; other than all the motorcycle officers and squad\r\ncars. They started coming in, I would say, in 4 minutes from the time\r\nthat this happened. They were swarming the building, which naturally I\r\nquit watching anything particular.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, about 4 minutes after the shots came you\r\nquit watching it? Would that be accurate, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, I would say somewhere in the neighborhood of 5\r\nminutes, 4 or 5 minutes. That would probably be true. I stayed there,\r\nbut I wasn't particularly watching.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, then as I understand your testimony, you\r\nsaid that from about the time of the shots until about 5 minutes after\r\nthe shots, you watched the back door of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the fact as to whether or not you saw anyone leave\r\nthe building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. They wasn't anyone left the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the fact as to whether or not you saw anyone enter\r\nthe building other than a police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No one entered while I was standing there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anybody running down the street near you at all?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you standing? How far were you from this stairway\r\ngoing to this Houston Street dock?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, after this KBOX--you are asking prior to before he\r\ngot there?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before KBOX got there first?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I would say I moved between 75 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 75 yards of the northeast corner of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. 75 yards of the northeast corner of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After KBOX got there?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. He got to about, I would say, maybe 35 yards to the\r\nbuilding, or 40. That is where he parked his car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did he stay, KBOX?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Oh. I would say 35 or 40 minutes. Then I went and called my\r\nwife and was telling her the sad news, and then I went back and stayed\r\nagain. I ended up laying off work. I didn't even work that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever contact the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It was on a Saturday night after I got in from work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What month was it?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It was this past month.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean March?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What caused you to contact the FBI in March?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I was trying to pinpoint the day that I must have come in\r\nfrom work. It was on the weekend that I'd come home, and there was a\r\npaper up in the left-hand corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Dallas newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which one, do you know, offhand?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Herald, the paper that I take.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see in the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I saw an article that was written by a guy, which I have\r\nbeen concerned about this thing all the way through, the assassination\r\nand I got to reading it, and it is a story that just don't jibe with\r\nabout me sitting there and watching the building. It just kind of upset\r\nme to know there is some monkey just hatched up such a story.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the story that you read that you got concerned about?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. About a guy seeing a rifle drawn in from the building above\r\nhim, and he also seen the people as the shots were being fired, and he\r\nalso seen some character running toward me with an overcoat on which\r\nwas brown or gray or blue, and he heard 4 shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. Do you remember what page of the paper\r\nthis was on?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It was on the headlines. I don't mean the headlines. It was\r\non the front page in the left corner of the page.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you say something concerned you about the article. Was\r\nit the fact that he said he saw a rifle there that concerned you?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir; the fact that he was running somebody over me, and\r\nthat is what I was out there doing. That is what I was doing. I was\r\nwatching.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the portion of the article that concerned you was\r\nthat someone said that someone else was running?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Towards Pacific Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Towards Pacific Street from the direction of the School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. That is the way the article read, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you tell the FBI when you called them?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I told them, tried to tell them about the same thing that I\r\nam telling you right now today.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have I ever mentioned before, by the way, or talked to you\r\nbefore this morning?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the fact as to whether or not as soon as we met, you\r\ncame in here and we started taking your deposition immediately?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right. Unless you called me last Saturday. I don't remember\r\nwho called me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, on Saturday, what did someone do, call you and tell\r\nyou to come down here?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did that person talk to you about the facts that we were\r\ntalking about now?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It wasn't I, just for the record. I believe it was the\r\nSecret Service that called you, but I am not sure.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. It was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, I understand your testimony correctly, what you are\r\nstating is that you don't believe anyone ran out of the building\r\ntowards you, at least within the first 5 minutes after the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't think anyone went out of the building during the\r\nfirst 5 minutes after the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. That is true.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else, any other information you have that\r\nyou feel might be helpful to the investigation of the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I can't think of anything, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we want to thank you very much for taking the time\r\nto come down here. We appreciate your cooperation, and certainly your\r\ncooperation particularly in volunteering to call the FBI to contact\r\nthem for this information.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Well, I felt that--I called an attorney that I know and\r\ntalked to him about the deal before I called the FBI, and I told him\r\nI wasn't doing this for a publicity thing. It was something I just\r\ndidn't, after reading that article, it kind of upset me, and he said he\r\nfelt it was my duty to call the FBI and let them know.\r\n\r\nAnd that is when I went ahead and made my statement.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mr. Romack, you have the right, if you want, to come\r\nback down here after these notes of the court reporter are typed, to\r\nread the typewritten transcript and sign it, or you can waive reading\r\nit and signing it and just have her send it directly to Washington,\r\nwhatever you want to do. It makes no difference with us.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. I will waive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You want to waive it then?\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Again we want to thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. ROMACK. You are quite welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF LEE E. BOWERS, JR.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Lee E. Bowers, Jr. was taken at 2 p.m., on April 2,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you stand and be sworn, Mr. Bowers?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give for this\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Lee E. Bowers, Jr.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what is your residence address?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. 10508 Maplegrove Lane.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And would you tell me something about yourself, where you\r\nwere born, raised, and what has been your business, generally, or\r\noccupation?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I was born right here in Dallas, and lived here most of\r\nmy life except when I was in the Navy, at the age of 17 to 21, and I\r\nwas away 2 years going to Hardin Simmons University, also, attended\r\nSouthern Methodist University 2 years, majoring in religion. I worked\r\nfor the railroad 15 years and was a self-employed builder, as well\r\nas--on the side. And the first of this year when I went to work as\r\nbusiness manager for Dr. Tim Green who operates this hospital and\r\nconvalescent home and rent properties.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What railroad did you work for?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Worked for the Union Terminal Co. with the 8 participating\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And on November 22, 1963, were you working for the Union\r\nTerminal Co.?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work were you doing for them?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I was tower man in the north tower, Union Terminal,\r\noperating the switches and signals controlling the movement of trains.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Through railroad yards?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were your hours of work?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. 7 to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, do you remember what is the height of--above the ground\r\nat which you worked in the tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. It is second story, it is 14 feet, 12 or 14 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You worked about 14 feet above the ground?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the tower was arranged so that you could see out?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; it is windows except for posts that--posts on each\r\ncorner. It is windows on all four sides.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is that located with reference to the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. It is west and north of this corner, and as to distances,\r\nI really don't know. It is within 50 yards of the back of the School\r\nDepository Building, or less.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say that it is built on higher ground, the base of\r\nthe tower on higher ground than around Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Approximately the same.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Same? It is higher ground than Elm as it recedes down under\r\nthe triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes, sir; considerably.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the base of your tower is about the same height as the\r\ntriple underpass, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, can you tell me why you refer to that as a triple\r\nunderpass? In our conversation here before you were sworn your\r\ndescription--you described it as a triple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. It is just a local connotation for it since there are three\r\nstreets that run under it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see. And how many sets of tracks do you control from your\r\ntower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. There are about 11 tracks in the station and 2 freight\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be 13 tracks that is, the tracks altogether, that\r\npass in front of your tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; of course where the tracks converge and cross and\r\nsplit off to various railroad yards----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the tracks are to the north and west of your tower,\r\naren't they?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Well, the tracks are west, but they proceed in all\r\ndirections, I mean, they are both north and south.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you were on duty on November 22, 1963, weren't you?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Close to noon, did you make any observation of the area\r\naround between your tower and Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; because of the fact that the area had been covered by\r\npolice for some 2 hours. Since approximately 10 o'clock in the morning\r\ntraffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around\r\ncould actually be observed. Since I had worked there for a number of\r\nyears I was familiar with most of the people who came in and out of the\r\narea.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice any cars around there?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; there were three cars that came in during the time\r\nfrom around noon until the time of the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Came in where?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. They came into the vicinity of the tower, which was at the\r\nextension of Elm Street, which runs in front of the School Depository,\r\nand which there is no way out. It is not a through street to anywhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is parking area behind the School Depository, between\r\nthat building and your tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Two or three railroad tracks and a small amount of parking\r\narea for the employees.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the first came along that you noticed about what time of\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I do not recall the exact time, but I believe this was\r\napproximately 12:10, wouldn't be too far off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the car you noticed, when you noticed the car, where was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. The car proceeded in front of the School Depository down\r\nacross 2 or 3 tracks and circled the area in front of the tower, and to\r\nthe west of the tower, and, as if he was searching for a way out, or\r\nwas checking the area, and then proceeded back through the only way he\r\ncould, the same outlet he came into.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The place where Elm dead ends?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. That's right. Back in front of the School Depository was\r\nthe only way he could get out. And I lost sight of him, I couldn't\r\nwatch him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was the description of that car?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. The first car was a 1959 Oldsmobile, blue and white station\r\nwagon with out-of-State license.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what State?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; I do not. I would know it, I could identify it, I\r\nthink, if I looked at a list.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And, it had something else, some bumper stickers?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Had a bumper sticker, one of which was a Goldwater sticker,\r\nand the other of which was of some scenic location, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And, did you see another car?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes, some 15 minutes or so after this, at approximately\r\n12 o'clock, 20 to 12--I guess 12:20 would be close to it, little time\r\ndifferential there--but there was another car which was a 1957 black\r\nFord, with one male in it that seemed to have a mike or telephone or\r\nsomething that gave the appearance of that at least.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How could you tell that?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He was holding something up to his mouth with one hand and\r\nhe was driving with the other, and gave that appearance. He was very\r\nclose to the tower. I could see him as he proceeded around the area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of license did that have?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Had a Texas license.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did it do as it came into the area, from what street?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Came in from the extension of Elm Street in front of the\r\nSchool Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see it leave?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; after 3 or 4 minutes cruising around the area it\r\ndeparted the same way. He did probe a little further into the area than\r\nthe first car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see another car?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Third car, which entered the area, which was some seven\r\nor nine minutes before the shooting, I believe was a 1961 or 1962\r\nChevrolet, four-door Impala, white, showed signs of being on the road.\r\nIt was muddy up to the windows, bore a similar out-of-state license to\r\nthe first car I observed, occupied also by one white male.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did it do?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He spent a little more time in the area. He tried--he\r\ncircled the area and probed one spot right at the tower in an attempt\r\nto get and was forced to back out some considerable distance, and\r\nslowly cruised down back towards the front of the School Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then did he leave?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. The last I saw of him he was pausing just about in--just\r\nabove the assassination site.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the car park, or continue on or did you notice?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Whether it continued on at that very moment or whether it\r\npulled up only a short distance, I couldn't tell. I was busy.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long was this before the President's car passed there?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. This last car? About 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you in a position where you could see the corner of Elm\r\nand Houston from the tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; I could not see the corner of Elm and Houston. I could\r\nsee the corner of Main and Houston as they came down and turned on,\r\nthen I couldn't see it for about half a block, and after they passed\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston the car came in sight again.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw the President's car coming out the Houston Street\r\nfrom Main, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; I saw that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you lost sight of it?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Right. For a moment.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you saw it again where?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. It came in sight after it had turned the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anything?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I heard three shots. One, then a slight pause, then two\r\nvery close together. Also reverberation from the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you able to form an opinion as to the source of the\r\nsound or what direction it came from, I mean?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. The sounds came either from up against the School\r\nDepository Building or near the mouth of the triple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to tell which?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; I could not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now, had you had any experience before being in the\r\ntower as to sounds coming from those various places?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; I had worked this same tower for some 10 or 12\r\nyears, and was there during the time they were renovating the School\r\nDepository Building, and had noticed at that time the similarity of\r\nsounds occurring in either of those two locations.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me now whether or not it came, the sounds you\r\nheard, the three shots came from the direction of the Depository\r\nBuilding or the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; I could not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From your experience there, previous experience there in\r\nhearing sounds that originated at the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding, did you notice that sometimes those sounds seem to come from\r\nthe triple underpass? Is that what you told me a moment ago?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. There is a similarity of sound, because there is a\r\nreverberation which takes place from either location.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you heard sounds originating near the triple underpass\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; quite often.\r\n\r\nBecause trucks backfire and various occurrences.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had heard noises originating from the Texas School\r\nDepository when they were building there?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. They were renovating. I--did carpenter work as well as\r\nsandblasted the outside of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, were there any people standing on the high side--high\r\nground between your tower and where Elm Street goes down under the\r\nunderpass toward the mouth of the underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Directly in line, towards the mouth of the underpass,\r\nthere were two men. One man, middle-aged, or slightly older, fairly\r\nheavy-set, in a white shirt, fairly dark trousers. Another younger man,\r\nabout midtwenties, in either a plaid shirt or plaid coat or jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they standing together or standing separately?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. They were standing within 10 or 15 feet of each other, and\r\ngave no appearance of being together, as far as I knew.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In what direction were they facing?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. They were facing and looking up towards Main and Houston,\r\nand following the caravan as it came down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anyone standing on the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. On the triple underpass, there were two policemen. One\r\nfacing each direction, both east and west. There was one railroad\r\nemployee, a signal man there with the Union Terminal Co., and two\r\nwelders that worked for the Fort Worth Welding firm, and there was also\r\na laborer's assistant furnished by the railroad to these welders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw those before the President came by, you saw those\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; they were there before and after.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were they standing on the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; they were standing on top of it facing towards Houston\r\nStreet, all except, of course, the one policeman on the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any other people up on this high ground?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. There were one or two people in the area. Not in this\r\nsame vicinity. One of them was a parking lot attendant that operates\r\na parking lot there. One or two. Each had uniforms similar to those\r\ncustodians at the courthouse. But they were some distance back, just a\r\nslight distance back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you heard the sound, which way were you looking?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. At the moment I heard the sound, I was looking directly\r\ntowards the area--at the moment of the first shot, as close as my\r\nrecollection serves, the car was out of sight behind this decorative\r\nmasonry wall in the area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And when you heard the second and third shot, could you see\r\nthe car?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; at the moment of the shots, I could--I do not think\r\nthat it was in sight. It came in sight immediately following the last\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any activity in this high ground above Elm after\r\nthe shot?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some\r\ncommotion, and immediately following there was a motorcycle policeman\r\nwho shot nearly all of the way to the top of the incline.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On his motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he come by way of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He was part of the motorcade and had left it for some\r\nreason, which I did not know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He came up----\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He came almost to the top and I believe abandoned his\r\nmotorcycle for a moment and then got on it and proceeded, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did he get up?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He just shot up over the curb and up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He didn't come then by way of Elm, which dead ends there?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. No; he left the motorcade and came up the incline on the\r\nmotorcycle.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was his motorcycle directed toward any particular people?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. He came up into this area where there are some trees, and\r\nwhere I had described the two men were in the general vicinity of this.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were the two men there at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I--as far as I know, one of them was. The other I could not\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThe darker dressed man was too hard to distinguish from the trees. The\r\none in the white shirt, yes; I think he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you said there was a commotion, what do you mean by\r\nthat? What did it look like to you when you were looking at the\r\ncommotion?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I just am unable to describe rather than it was something\r\nout of the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred\r\nin this particular spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted\r\nmy eye for some reason, which I could not identify.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You couldn't describe it?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Nothing that I could pinpoint as having happened that----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Afterwards did a good many people come up there on this high\r\nground at the tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. A large number of people came, more than one direction.\r\nOne group converged from the corner of Elm and Houston, and came\r\ndown the extension of Elm and came into the high ground, and another\r\nline--another large group went across the triangular area between\r\nHouston and Elm and then across Elm and then up the incline. Some of\r\nthem all the way up.\r\n\r\nMany of them did, as well as, of course, between 50 and a hundred\r\npolicemen within a maximum of 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In this area around your tower?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. That's right. Sealed off the area, and I held off the\r\ntrains until they could be examined, and there was some transients\r\ntaken on at least one train.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I believe you have talked this over with me before your\r\ndeposition was taken, haven't we?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there anything that you told me that I haven't asked you\r\nabout that you think of?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Nothing that I can recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have told me all that you know about this, haven't you?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Yes; I believe that I have related everything which I have\r\ntold the city police, and also told to the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And everything you told me before we started taking the\r\ndeposition?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. To my knowledge I can remember nothing else.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, this will be reduced to writing, and you can sign it,\r\nlook it over and sign it, or waive your signature if you wish.\r\n\r\nWhat do you wish?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. I have no reason to sign it unless you want me to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you just as leave waive the signature?\r\n\r\nMr. BOWERS. Fine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then we thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF B. J. MARTIN\r\n\r\nThe testimony of B. J. Martin was taken at 10:10 a.m., on April 3,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you stand up, please, and be sworn?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before\r\nthis Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state you name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. B. J. Martin.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what is your residence address?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. 11830 Flamingo Lane, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I am a police officer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With the Dallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been with the Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It will be 11 years in June.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me something about yourself, when you were born and\r\nwhere you were raised and where you went to school?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I was born in Maud, Okla., Seminole County--went to\r\nschool--high school at Maud, Okla., and entered the Navy in 1948, from\r\nthere and was discharged in 1952 and lived at Compton, Okla., for\r\napproximately a year, and then returned to Dallas and was employed in\r\nthe Police Department in June 1953.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you employed as a motorcycle officer at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; I was employed as an apprentice policeman and\r\nworked in the radio patrol division.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are not a motorcycleman?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been a motorcycle officer?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Let's see, 8 years in January.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, did you have some special assignment?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I was assigned to the motorcade of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you went out to Love Field, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; we made detail about 7 o'clock that morning\r\nand was assigned, I don't recall now just what time--it was about 30\r\nminutes before his plane was to arrive at Love Field.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And in the motorcade what was your position?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I was assigned to ride on the left-hand rear side of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you riding alone there, or was another officer\r\nriding with you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There was another officer riding with me, B. W. Hargis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was parallel to you on another motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; we were----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Two motorcycles abreast?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As you turned onto Houston from Main, can you tell me about\r\nthe speed of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. My estimation would be 4 to 5 miles an hour when we made\r\nthe turn onto Elm Street from Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you make the turn from Main to Houston about the\r\nsame speed?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; we were going a little faster, I would\r\nsay--between probably 10 and 15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then the block between Main and Elm, did the motorcade\r\nslow down?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It slowed down just before we made the turn onto Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's take the President's car--what do you think the speed\r\nof the President's car was as you made that turn from Houston onto Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe the speed was about 4 or 5 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was your speed?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Approximately the same--maybe a mile slower.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to maintain your position on the two-wheeler\r\nmotorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I believe I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the minimum speed at which you can maintain the\r\nposition of that motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. About 2 miles per hour, I would imagine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the President's car pick up any speed from the corner of\r\nHouston and Elm--we'll say half way down that hill?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; I don't recall it picking up any speed in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They were going fairly slow?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It may have picked up, gradually picked up, but not enough\r\nthat I could notice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear any unusual noise?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I heard a shot, or what I thought at the time to\r\nbe a shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was the position of your motorcycle at that time with\r\nreference to the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Just to the rear of his car--on the left rear of his car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far from the car, I'll say, to the left of the car and\r\nthen how far to the rear--so I can get some idea of your position?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I would say that my motor was 5-foot to the left and\r\napproximately 6- to 8-foot to the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Of the President's car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you anywhere near the front end of the Secret Service\r\ncar?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The car the Secret Service men were in?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes; we were alongside the front end of their car, because\r\none of the agents got off of the car after the first shot. The best I\r\ncan remember--I was fairly close to him--he was the person riding on\r\nthe fender of the car and the first agent from the front of the car,\r\nand I was fairly close to him when he jumped off of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, where was the motorcycle driven by Mr. Hargis, with\r\nreference to your right or to your left?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. He was to my right when we made the turn on Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the time you heard this shot, where was he?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I presume he was still to my right. I don't recall seeing\r\nhim after the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He would have been closer to the President's car than you\r\nwould have?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir--he would have been--I would say 3- or 4-foot\r\ncloser than I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You traveled along the street about 3 or 4 feet apart from\r\neach other?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir--something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you heard the first shot, did you have any idea of the\r\ndirection which the shot was coming from?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; I didn't. I couldn't tell from which direction it\r\nwas coming--any of the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you look?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I looked back to my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After which shot?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. After the first shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You looked to your right?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I looked back to my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you look at?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. At the building on the right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As you turned to the right, did you turn your motorcycle\r\nalso, or did you turn your body?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe I just turned my body. I don't believe I ever\r\nturned my motor. I believe I kept my motor headed down Elm Street--west\r\non Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you take any notice of the President after the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I looked at the President after I heard the shot\r\nand he was leaning forward--I could see the left side of his face. At\r\nthe time he had no expression on his face.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, did you hear some more shots?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Two more shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything when you looked at the School Depository\r\nBuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir--just the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you able to tell--to determine or did you have any\r\nopinion, as to the direction from which the shots were coming--the last\r\ntwo shots--from which direction they came?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; you couldn't tell just where they were coming from.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there any breeze that day?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From what direction?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I believe it was blowing out of the southwest at that\r\nparticular location. It seemed like we were going to turn into the wind\r\nas we turned off of Houston onto Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The wind was in your face?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes; the best I can recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, afterward, did the motorcade pick up speed then?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. After we turned onto Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; after the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes--after the shots we picked up speed.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go on to Parkland?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; I did. I rode just part of the time alongside of\r\nthe President's car. At times we were forced to the rear because of the\r\npedestrians standing out on Stemmons and there just wasn't enough room\r\nto ride in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you see the President?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; I couldn't see him--immediately after the first\r\nshot I saw him and after that I couldn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you see the Governor at all?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir. I didn't pay any attention to the Governor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, when you got to Parkland Hospital, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. We pulled into the emergency entrance to Parkland Hospital.\r\nThe traffic had already begun to stack up and the officers ahead of\r\nthe motorcade went on down into the exit and I stopped off at the\r\nfirst turn into the exit about 50 or 60 yards from the entrance to the\r\nemergency and began to cut traffic so they wouldn't block the roadway\r\ndown into the emergency and then we had to park cars--just a lot of\r\npeople got out of their cars and it was all blocked up and we had to\r\npark cars and just generally work traffic around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You had a white helmet on?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you notice any stains on your helmet?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; during the process of working traffic there, I\r\nnoticed that there were blood stains on the windshield on my motor and\r\nthen I pulled off my helmet and I noticed there were blood stains on\r\nthe left side of my helmet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To give a more accurate description of the left side, could\r\nyou tell us about where it started with reference to the forehead?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was just to the left--of what would be the center of\r\nmy forehead--approximately halfway, about a quarter of the helmet had\r\nspots of blood on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were there any other spots of any other material on the\r\nhelmet there besides blood?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir; there was other matter that looked like pieces of\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about your uniform?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There was blood and matter on my left shoulder of my\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You pointed to a place in front of your shoulder, about the\r\nclavicle region?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that about where it was?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the front of your uniform and not on the side?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be left, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes; on the left side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And just below the level of the shoulder?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what spots were there?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. They were blood spots and other matter.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what did you notice on your windshield?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. There was blood and other matter on my windshield and also\r\non the motor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the blood noticeable--were there large splotches?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No; they weren't large splotches, they were small--it was\r\nnot very noticeable unless you looked at it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the discoloration on your helmet noticeable?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Not too much--no--as a matter of fact, there were other\r\npeople around there and two more officers there and they never noticed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At that time were you with Mr. Hargis?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir; I don't believe that he went to the hospital with\r\nus. I believe he stopped there at the scene of the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you ever see his helmet or his uniform or the\r\nwindshield of his motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir--I never recall seeing him again until the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, was this blood on the outside or the inside of your\r\nwindshield?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was on the outside of my windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it on the right or left side?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was on the outside of my windshield.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what about the fender of the motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It was just in the front--right on the front just above the\r\ncowling on the motorcycle.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say that when you first heard the first shot you thought\r\nit was rifle fire?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir--the sharp crack of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are you familiar with guns?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever fire a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you own a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have been hunting, I suppose?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I just returned.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You've shot high-powered rifles, have you?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what do you think the speed of the President's car\r\nwas--give me your best estimate of the speed of the President's car\r\nwhen you heard the first shot?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. I would say it was under 10 miles an hour--between 5 and 10\r\nat that particular time, about the time of the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were going downhill at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir. The best I remember--I wasn't having any trouble\r\nkeeping my motor up at that time, so that it was probably between 5 and\r\n10 miles an hour. I don't think it was any faster than 10.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you at any time come abreast of the President's car in\r\nthe motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you under certain instructions as to how far behind the\r\ncar you were to keep?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were those instructions?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. They instructed us that they didn't want anyone riding past\r\nthe President's car and that we were to ride to the rear, to the rear\r\nof his car, about the rear bumper.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all, Officer.\r\n\r\nThis will be written up and you can look it over and sign it if you\r\nwish, or you can waive your signature and we will send it on to the\r\nCommission without it.\r\n\r\nIt's your option.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to do?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. It doesn't make any difference--it's the truth as I saw it\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You just as soon waive your signature, then?\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. That would be fine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, we'll waive your signature.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thanks very much for coming in.\r\n\r\nMr. MARTIN. Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BOBBY W. HARGIS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Bobby W. Hargis was taken at 3:20 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Will you stand, please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the evidence you are about to give shall be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Would you state for the record your name and residence\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Bobby W. Hargis, 1818 Adelaide, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Police officer.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. How long have you been a member of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Nine years and about 7 months.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you are now a member of the motorcycle----\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Division.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Division?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Were you a part of the motorcade on November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes; I was.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. In what position?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. I was at the left-hand side of the Presidential limousine.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. At what part of the President's car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Front, or rear?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Oh. Rear.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Riding next to Mrs. Kennedy?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Will you describe what occurred or what you observed as the\r\nlimousine turned into Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well, at the time that the limousine turned left on Elm\r\nStreet I was staying pretty well right up with the car. Sometimes on\r\nElm we couldn't get right up next to it on account of the crowd, but\r\nthe crowd was thinning out down here at the triple underpass, so, I\r\nwas next to Mrs. Kennedy when I heard the first shot, and at that time\r\nthe President bent over, and Governor Connally turned around. He was\r\nsitting directly in front of him, and a real shocked and surprised\r\nexpression on his face.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On Governor Connally's?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes; that is why I thought Governor Connally had been shot\r\nfirst, but it looked like the President was bending over to hear what\r\nhe had to say, and I thought to myself then that Governor Connally,\r\nthe Governor had been hit, and then as the President raised back up\r\nlike that (indicating) the shot that killed him hit him. I don't know\r\nwhether it was the second or the third shot. Everything happened so\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. But, you cannot now recall more than two shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. That is all that I can recall remembering. Of course,\r\neverything was moving so fast at the time that there could have been 30\r\nmore shots that I probably never would have noticed them.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did something happen to you, personally in connection with\r\nthe shot you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. You mean about the blood hitting me?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes; when President Kennedy straightened back up in the\r\ncar the bullet him in the head, the one that killed him and it seemed\r\nlike his head exploded, and I was splattered with blood and brain, and\r\nkind of a bloody water. It wasn't really blood. And at that time the\r\nPresidential car slowed down. I heard somebody say, \"Get going,\" or\r\n\"get going,\"----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Someone inside----\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. I don't know whether it was the Secret Service car, and I\r\nremembered seeing Officer Chaney. Chaney put his motor in first gear\r\nand accelerated up to the front to tell them to get everything out of\r\nthe way, that he was coming through, and that is when the Presidential\r\nlimousine shot off, and I stopped and got off my motorcycle and ran to\r\nthe right-hand side of the street, behind the light pole.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Just a minute. Do you recall your impression at the time\r\nregarding the source of the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well, at the time it sounded like the shots were right next\r\nto me. There wasn't any way in the world I could tell where they were\r\ncoming from, but at the time there was something in my head that said\r\nthat they probably could have been coming from the railroad overpass,\r\nbecause I thought since I had got splattered, with blood--I was just\r\na little back and left of--just a little bit back and left of Mrs.\r\nKennedy, but I didn't know. I had a feeling that it might have been\r\nfrom the Texas Book Depository, and these two places was the primary\r\nplace that could have been shot from.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. You were clear that the sounds were sounds of shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes, sir; I knew they were shots.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. All right, what did you do then? You say you parked your\r\nmotorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes, uh-huh----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. It was to the left-hand side of the street from--south side\r\nof Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. I ran across the street looking over towards the railroad\r\noverpass and I remembered seeing people scattering and running and then\r\nI looked----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. People on the overpass?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes; people that were there to see the President I guess.\r\nThey were taking pictures and things. It was kind of a confused crowd.\r\nI don't know whether they were trying to hide or see what was happening\r\nor what--and then I looked over to the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding, and no one that was standing at the base of the building\r\nwas--seemed to be looking up at the building or anything like they knew\r\nwhere the shots were coming from, so----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. How about the people on the incline on the north side of Elm\r\nStreet? Do you recall their behavior?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes; I remember a man holding a child. Fell to the ground\r\nand covered his child with his body, and people running everywhere,\r\ntrying to get out of there, I guess, and they were about as confused as\r\nto where the shots were coming from as everyone else was.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And did you run up the incline on your side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes, sir; I ran to the light post, and I ran up to this\r\nkind of a little wall, brick wall up there to see if I could get a\r\nbetter look on the bridge, and, of course, I was looking all around\r\nthat place by that time. I knew it couldn't have come from the county\r\ncourthouse because that place was swarming with deputy sheriffs over\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you get behind the picket fence that runs from the\r\noverpass to the concrete wall?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On the north side of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. No, no; I don't remember any picket fence.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Did you observe anything then on the overpass, or on the\r\nincline, or around the Depository? Anything out of the ordinary besides\r\npeople running?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. No; I didn't. That is what got me.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. So, at that point you were still uncertain as to the\r\ndirection of the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Then, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well, then, I thought since I had looked over at the Texas\r\nBook Depository and some people looking out of the windows up there,\r\ndidn't seem like they knew what was going on, but none of them were\r\nlooking towards, or near anywhere the shots had been fired from. At the\r\ntime I didn't know, but about the only activity I could see was on the\r\nbridge, on the railroad bridge so----\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. What sort of activity was that?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well, the people that were up there were just trying to get\r\na better look at what was happening and was in a haze and running, or\r\nin a confused fashion, and I thought maybe some of them had seen who\r\ndid the shooting and the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Then I got back on my motorcycle, which was still running,\r\nand rode underneath the first underpass to look on the opposite side\r\nin order to see if I could see anyone running away from the scene, and\r\nsince I didn't see anyone coming from that direction I rode under the\r\nsecond underpass, which is Stemmons Expressway and went up around to\r\nsee if I could see anyone coming from across Stemmons and back that\r\nway, and I couldn't see anything that was of a suspicious nature,\r\nso, I came back to the Texas School Book Depository. At that time it\r\nseemed like the activity was centered around the Texas School Book\r\nDepository, so, that is when I heard someone say, one of the sergeants\r\nor lieutenants, I don't know, \"Don't let anyone out of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository,\" and so, I went to a gap that had not been filled,\r\nwhich was at the southwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. And you remained there until you were relieved?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Anything else that you haven't told us that you think is\r\nrelevant to our inquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. No; I don't believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you very much, Mr. Hargis.\r\n\r\nThe reporter will transcribe your testimony and have it available for\r\nyou to read and sign if you care to. Otherwise, you may waive your\r\nright to review and sign the testimony and she will mail it direct to\r\nthe Commission, whichever you prefer. It is entirely your option.\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well; it really doesn't make any difference. It is more or\r\nless what you all think is best.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. It's entirely up to you.\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. Well, how long will it be until she fixes it up?\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Well, off the record.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. On the record.\r\n\r\nMr. HARGIS. All right. Well, just go ahead and I will just let you go\r\nahead and send it in without the signature.\r\n\r\nMr. STERN. Thank you very much, Mr. Hargis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CLYDE A.

Went to work for the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What year was that?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. 1955.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been with them ever since?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Other than 11 months in which I left the department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do in that 11 months?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Went into a business of my own.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then went back to the department?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was your assignment that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Solo motorcycle officer on escort of the Presidential\r\nmotorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You started with the motorcade at Love Field?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Went through town with him?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you riding as you went through town?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Riding to the right rear of the Presidential car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many cars back, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Well, it varied. It would be hard to say as to how many\r\ncars back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether Officer M. L. Baker was riding?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. He was riding in front of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you would be riding several cars back, generally, from\r\nthe President's car, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear any shots at all?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I was on Main Street just approaching Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were the three spaced equally distant?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was one more close than the other one?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. The last two were closer than the first. In other words,\r\nit was the first, and then a pause, and then the other two were real\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after you heard the sounds?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I made the shift down to lower gear and went on to the\r\nscene of the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean by the scene of the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. There on Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I am sorry, on Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What position of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Be just west of Houston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the scene of the shooting, do you mean the place where\r\nyou believed the President's car was when the bullets struck?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. When I first got to the location there, I was still on\r\nHouston Street, and in the process of making a left turn onto Elm\r\nStreet I could see all these people laying on the ground there on Elm.\r\nSome of them were pointing back up to the railroad yard, and a couple\r\nof people were headed back up that way, and I immediately tried to jump\r\nthe north curb there in the 400 block, which was too high for me to get\r\nover.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean with your motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. And I left my motor on the street and ran to the railroad\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you ran to the railroad yard, would that be north\r\nor south of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. The railroad yard would be located at the--it consist of\r\ngoing over Elm Street and back north of Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Well, there was nothing. There was quite a few people in\r\nthe area, spectators, and at that time I went back to my motorcycle--it\r\nwas on the street--to the radio.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any people running away from there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No. They was all going to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk to any people over there or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. In the railroad yard, I talked to one of the people I\r\npresumed to be a railroad detective that was in the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had he been in the yard before or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No. He was just coming into the area after I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was coming into the area after the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything to you, that you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Nothing that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I went back to my motorcycle, which was sitting on Elm\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. At that time some people came up and started talking to me\r\nas to the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did they say?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. One stated that he had seen the President when the first\r\nshot was fired, and that he definitely was hit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say where the shot came from?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. And I asked him about where the shots came from, and he\r\nstated that he didn't know, that he was looking at him when the first\r\nshot was fired, and that he slumped. And when the second shot was\r\nfired, he went completely out of sight.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You talked to any other witnesses there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes. There was another one came up who was located, at the\r\ntime he stated, on the south side of Elm Street back toward the triple\r\nunderpass. Back, well, it would be north of the underpass there, and\r\nsaid he had gotten hit by a piece of concrete or something, and he did\r\nhave a slight cut on his right cheek, upper portion of his cheek just\r\nto the right of his nose.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would he have been to the front or to the back of the\r\nPresidential car at the time of the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I don't know what you mean to the front or the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When he was standing, was he to the west or to the east of\r\nthe President's car at the time of the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. He would be to the south of it and then west.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Southwest of it?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Talk to anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. And at that time, approximately, well, I was talking to\r\nhim at the time this other man came up and told me that he didn't\r\nknow what it was about, but he was quite sure the shot had come from\r\nthis building there which he pointed out to be the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say why?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. He said when the first shot was fired he glanced back and\r\nthere was something in the building, he couldn't determine what it was,\r\nbut it was just something there that he couldn't explain, but he was\r\ndefinite that the shots did come from there.\r\n\r\nAnd after talking to him and the man that was on the other side that\r\ncomplained he was hit by a piece of concrete from the ricochet at that\r\ntime, I called the dispatcher and asked for squads to cover the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building off.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what your number was that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Beg your pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what number you used for calling the\r\ndispatcher that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes. My original call number is 142.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I have here a Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A, which appears to\r\nbe a transcript of a police radio log, and I notice that at 12:35 p.m.,\r\nthere is a call from 142 to 531. 531 is your station headquarters?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you want to read what you said?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. \"I talked to a guy at the scene who says the shots were\r\nfired from the Texas School Book Depository Building with the Hertz\r\nRent A Car sign on top.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what you said?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Approximately. I don't recall the exact words.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There was a response to you. What does it say there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. \"Get his name, address, phone number and all information\r\nyou can.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No, I never.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What happened?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Because I was told to go to the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding. I instructed the three different people to come to the front\r\nof the School Book Depository Building and remain there until they were\r\ntalked to.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You took these people that you had with you?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I did not take them, no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You instructed them to go there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In front of the School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And remain there until someone talked to them?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know the names of these people?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No, I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know who talked to them at all?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. At that time I went to the School Building at the rear\r\nlocation of it, which would be----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To the back door?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. North side of it, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where that door leads out there to the dock?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes; on the northeast corner there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. At that time I talked to the colored male that was\r\nstanding at the door and asked him how long he had been there, and he\r\nsaid he had been there some 5 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nAnd I asked him if anyone had came out that door, and he said that they\r\nhad not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember his name?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. At that time, it was people, squads and all arriving at\r\nthe scene, and I went on into the building, which they stayed outside,\r\nand helped them search the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. That is about all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you search the building on the sixth floor or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you there when they found the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you there when they found the shells?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when the shells were found?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I was on the sixth floor when the shells were found. I was\r\nstill on the sixth when they found the rifle--on the fifth.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On the fifth?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Sixth floor, rather, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where on the sixth floor were you when the shells were found?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I don't recall just exactly where it was at. It was on the\r\nfloor there, though. It was just a big open floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you mean they were somewhere on that open floor?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear someone say they have shells, something like\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember who that was?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Went up to another location there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw some shells there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see them?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. They were there under the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which window?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. On the southeast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. South side or east side?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. On the southeast corner facing south.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. See any paper bags or anything around there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes; there was a lunch bag there. You could call it a\r\nlunch bag.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. There at the same location where the shells were.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there a coke bottle or anything with it?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Dr. Pepper bottle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. See any long bags which would be a foot or foot and a half\r\nor more long?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes; just a plain brown paper bag with tape in the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What, tape?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes; there was just brown paper tape on it. Just a brown\r\npaper bag with paper tape. It had been taped up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long was that, if you can remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. The exact length, I couldn't say. It was approximately\r\nrifle length.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this have been right under the window, or to the east\r\nor west of the window, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. As I remember, it was directly in the corner, in the\r\nsoutheast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, as you remember, was the window directly in the\r\nsoutheast corner, or was the window a little bit to the west of that\r\ncorner, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. The window at that location faces south, on the southeast\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far from the east corner of the building is the\r\nwindow?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Well, it is just approximately like that, and then the\r\ncorner here. Like the window would be there, and then it would be a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As far as the window in this room from that corner\r\n[indicating in room]?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I wouldn't even attempt to say the approximate distance of\r\nthe window from the corner. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, if you don't know, that is what I want to find out.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the bag right under the window?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. It was in the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Not under the window?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No; it was in the corner of the building, the southeast\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you noticed up there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, where were you when you saw the--when you heard a rifle\r\nhad been found?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. On the floor there, best as I can remember, and I went to\r\nthat same location as the other one, just like I stated on the other\r\none where the shells was found.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember where that rifle was found, roughly, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. It was in a row of books back on the opposite corner. Be\r\non the west side of the building, back to the northwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, anything else you remember while you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after that, after the rifle was found?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Well, it still wasn't determined whether the assailant\r\nwasn't still in the building even at that time, even after the rifle\r\nwas found, and the search was continued in the building for a while\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. At that time after that I went to the street, went\r\ndownstairs to the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you participate in any other investigation that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about on Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. On Saturday I was on my way to Colorado.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you weren't around on Sunday either?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No. On Sunday when the other shooting was taking place, I\r\nwas knee deep in snow in Colorado.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any other information you can think of, whether\r\nI have asked it or not, that in any way would be relevant to the\r\nassassination of the President or the shooting of Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No, nothing; I was out of town.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, sir. We thank you very much for your cooperation\r\nhere. You have an opportunity, if you want to come down and read this\r\ndeposition and sign it before it goes to Washington, or you can waive\r\nthe reading and signing of it and just have the court reporter send it\r\ndirectly to us, whatever you want to do?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. It makes no difference.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It makes no difference to us either.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Just waive the signing. I don't know when I can get back\r\nover here.\r\n\r\n(Officer Haygood was summoned back in a few minutes from across the\r\nstreet at the Republic National Bank Building to answer the following\r\nquestion.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Officer Haygood, I will continue your deposition with one\r\nmore question, if you would, and you are still under oath.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned in your sworn deposition that you talked to about two\r\npeople that you saw, and you pointed it out in your transmission at\r\n12:35 p.m., under your Call No. 142.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I notice on there another transmission at 12:37 p.m. Could\r\nyou read what the transcript has there.\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Well, this part of the deposition I covered it a while\r\nago but I gave you, is when I called to have the Texas School Book\r\nDepository covered there. That is one of the witnesses I had that\r\nbelieved the shot came from that location.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you read what you said there?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. It says, \"Get men to cover the building, Texas School Book\r\nDepository, believe the shots came from there, facing it on Elm Street\r\nlooking at the building it will be the second window from the end in\r\nthe upper right hand corner.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you say that?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then the transmission made to you, 531 to 142 calling, \"How\r\nmany do you have there?\"\r\n\r\nAnd you made a response which is?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. \"One guy possibly hit by a ricochet off the concrete and\r\nanother seen the President slump.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were there two more people in addition to the one that you\r\nsaw?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. They are still the same people I was referring to back on\r\nthe transmission that I made.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many different people did you talk to? One that was\r\npossibly hit by a ricochet?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Piece of concrete.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he the one that saw the President slump?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there someone that saw the President slump, and a\r\nthird stated it was from the second window from the end in the upper\r\nright-hand corner?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. I don't recall how many it was. There was quite a chaos\r\nthere at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if there were two or more than two?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about the description of the man\r\nthat said that the shot came from the second window from the end in the\r\nupper right-hand corner?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if he was white or Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. He was a white man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Man or woman?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether he was young or medium or old?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. That would be a guess on my part. I don't recall. He was\r\njust a medium age.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if he was dressed in a suit or not a suit?\r\n\r\nMr. HAYGOOD. Best I remember, just sports clothes. I mean, it consisted\r\nof no tie or coat.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Okay, thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF E. D. BREWER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of E. D. Brewer was taken at 10 a.m., on April 9, 1964,\r\nin the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and\r\nErvay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel\r\nof the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you stand and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you state your name.\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. E. D. Brewer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your occupation, Mr. Brewer?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Police officer for the City of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I am 32 years old.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You go to school here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you get through school?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I graduated from high school.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I got married and went to work for the Dallas Power &\r\nLight. About a year later I went into the U.S. Coast Guard and stayed 3\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Honorable discharge?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I went to work for the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been working for them about 10 years now?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Since December 1954.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was your assignment that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was riding solo motorcycle, in the Presidential motorcade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What position were you in in the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was in the front.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By which car? Near which car?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. If I remember correctly, the President's car was about--the\r\nChief of Police was in a car immediately in front. The President's car\r\nwas behind him, I believe, if I remember correctly, and I was in front\r\nof the Chief's car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were in front of the Chief's car?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were in the lead part of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes. I was the front vehicle. There was four or five of us\r\nup there in a line across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember how fast you were going as you went down\r\nMain Street there towards Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir; not exactly. The speed of it would vary\r\nconsiderably according to the crowd of people on each side of the\r\nstreet as to how we could get through.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you remember how fast you were going as you turned north\r\non Houston?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. It was in my assignment to leave my position there and go\r\nahead of the motorcade as we were approaching Houston on Main Street,\r\nand before we got to Houston Street I left. I pulled out ahead of them,\r\nand following the same route, went down to the intersection or to where\r\nthe motorcade was to come onto Stemmons Freeway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So your speed wasn't necessarily accurate with the\r\nmotorcade, is that correct, sometimes?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir; I had pulled away from the motorcade on Main\r\nStreet and proceeded on down to the Stemmons Freeway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when you heard the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I never did hear any shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When was the first time you learned that something was wrong?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was on Stemmons Freeway there where you come onto it,\r\nwhere the motorcade come onto Stemmons. Went under Stemmons and around\r\nto the right and onto Stemmons, and I was on Stemmons Expressway off of\r\nmy motorcycle there on the expressway when I believe I heard it on the\r\nradio first about the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you to stop traffic on the expressway?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes. I was to assist some other officers in stopping\r\ntraffic on the expressway to allow the motorcade to get onto it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you were in the process of stopping traffic, waiting for\r\nthe motorcade to come by, when you heard something on your motorcycle\r\nradio?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far were you from the so-called underpass there, or\r\noverpass there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was to the north of where the railroad track goes over.\r\nLet's see, the railroad track, where the railroad tracks go over\r\nStemmons Expressway. I was to the north of that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me try and get a sketch. Officer, I just stepped out of\r\nthe room to come back in and bring a map of Dallas, which I believe\r\nis similar to Commission's Exhibit 371, which I am going to mark here\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, which we will call it E. D. Brewer deposition\r\nExhibit A. I have it marked in red pencil here, and on this map of\r\nDallas, on one side of it in one corner of it is a section called,\r\nDowntown Dallas, and this is towards the top of the reverse side of the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to look at this map. You see the place here, it\r\nlooks like Dedley Plaza, Main Street runs into that, which is Houston,\r\nthen you turned north on Houston and Elm, and then you take Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Left on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Left on Elm. You went under the railroad underpass there,\r\nwhich appears to be in green on the map, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then I am going to ask you to take a pencil or a ball point\r\npen, and you might just follow the route that you took. Just mark it\r\nparallel to whatever street you took to where you ended up.\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. (Marks on map.)\r\n\r\nDown Elm under the railroad tracks to Stemmons, under Stemmons to the\r\nright, headed north parallel to Stemmons on that entranceway, under\r\nthat T & P Railroad, and onto Stemmons Expressway, and just north of\r\nthe T & P Railroad.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now is that where you stopped your motorcycle?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am going to put an arrow pointing to the spot that you\r\nstopped, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, that is the spot right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have it marked kind of with an \"X\"?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. To the best of my knowledge, that is right where we was at.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was another officer there at the time when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were they doing?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. We all proceeded to stop the traffic northbound on Stemmons.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why were you going to do that?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. So that the motorcade which was headed in that direction at\r\nthat time could get onto Stemmons and wouldn't be interfered with by\r\nthe rest of the traffic.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, where were you when you first learned of the\r\nshooting or that something was wrong?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. At that location.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How did you learn about it?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I believe it was on the radio, we heard it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. On the police radio. Well, when it was determined\r\nthat--right after we heard that on the radio, something about it on\r\nthe radio, we heard that they were enroute to Parkland Hospital,\r\nand immediately after that they came by us and came onto Stemmons\r\nExpressway and went by us in the direction of Parkland Hospital, the\r\nmotorcade, part of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. We heard that the shots had came from the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building, and at that time I got on my motorcycle and\r\nproceeded back up to the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I went in the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir; there was officers all around the building at the\r\ntime I got there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Well, with some other officers, we was part of the officers\r\nthat was searching the building floor by floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what was your call number that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. 137.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Handing you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition Exhibit\r\nA, which appears to be a transcript of a police log of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department, you see this exhibit here?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your call number that day was?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. 137.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I notice here that the first time there appears Call No.\r\n137, after 12:30 is at 12:38 p.m.\r\n\r\nThere is a call from 137 to 531. You want to read what it says there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. \"A witness says he saw 'em pull the weapon from the\r\nwindow off the second floor on the southeast corner of the Depository\r\nBuilding.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that have been the second floor or the second floor\r\nfrom the top?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember any witness talking to you at all?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. He said that he had saw him pull a weapon from the window\r\nfrom that building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what window he said?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I don't remember specifically which window he indicated,\r\nbut I immediately told that to the dispatcher and proceeded on up to\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I see the conversation continues on the next page. The\r\ndispatcher No. 531, to 137, \"Do you have the building covered off?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then you reply:\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. \"I'm about three-fourths of a block away.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that where you were when this man----\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now from the time you first heard that something was wrong,\r\nyou had taken your motorcycle and gone where?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were on the Stemmons Freeway when you heard that\r\nsomething was wrong, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went from Stemmons Freeway where?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Up to the Texas School Depository Building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you stop anywhere along the way?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir; the only time that I stopped was when this guy\r\ncome up to me and told it to me, and then was gone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you did stop then and talk to this one individual?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which street were you on when you stopped?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was proceeding back up Elm Street the wrong way on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About where were you when this one person talked that said\r\nhe saw him pull the weapon in?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was down there about the triple underpass on Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean right under the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Or coming to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, coming to it?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. From the west.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you have been on the west side of that?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, right there about that curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before you left Stemmons Freeway, did you look up or around\r\nto see if there was anything suspicious in that area?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. We was all looking up in the railroad tracks from the west\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything at all?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir; we saw some people coming up there, but they\r\nseemed to be up there looking.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you saw people up there searching?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anybody running away?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. See anyone acting suspiciously by himself?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you left that area and came right down the wrong way,\r\nyou say, back to retrace your route, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then somewhere in the vicinity of the railroad underpass,\r\nyou were stopped by this one individual that you reported on the radio\r\nlog, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether this man that you talked to was a\r\nwhite male or a Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. He was a white man, the best of my memory.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything else about him?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he have any camera or anything?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now after this order to report to the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I went there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Went in the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which door?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. By the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had the building been sealed off by the time you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were officers blocking everyone that was coming in, to\r\nprohibit them from coming in and going out?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I went inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I proceeded to assist in the floor to floor search of the\r\nbuilding with some other officers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What floor did you start on?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. On the bottom floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went up to the top?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far up did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. We searched all of it before we quit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, were you ever on the 6th floor?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you on the sixth floor when you found anything there?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you find?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I was on the sixth floor when they found those spent cases\r\nfrom the rifle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when they found them?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I don't know exactly. I was on the floor searching around\r\nin among some boxes that were stacked up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Hear anyone say anything about cartridge cases or anything?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir. Whoever found them turned around and let it be\r\nknown to one of the supervisor officers that he had found them, or that\r\nthey had been found over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you heard the news?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. I continued searching.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go and take a look at the cartridge cases?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many cartridge cases did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were they?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. They were there under, by the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What window?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. In the southeast corner of the building, facing south.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. See anything else there at the time by the window?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Paper lunch sack and some chicken bones or partially eaten\r\npiece of chicken, or a piece of chicken.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. A drink bottle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What bottle?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. A cold drink bottle, soda pop bottle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. In relation to what?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything else in the southeast corner?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. There was a paper, relatively long paper sack there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. It was there in the southeast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Under the window?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir. To the left of it. To the east of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To the left as you faced the window?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the window come right up next to the corner there, do\r\nyou remember?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir; it didn't come up next to the corner. It was\r\noffset.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Can you remember how far at all, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir; I don't remember the exact distance of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was any part of the paper sack under the window, if you\r\nremember or not?\r\n\r\nThat long paper sack?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything about what the sack looked like?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Well, it was assumed at the time that it was the sack that\r\nthe rifle was wrapped up in when it was brought into the building, and\r\nit appeared that it could have been used for that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you mean you assumed that before you found the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir; I suppose. That was discussed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember anything else that was found around there or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Not in that particular area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything found anywhere else in the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir. The rifle was found on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. It was found in a northwest corner under some, in between\r\nsome boxes that were stacked up there at the head of the stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you there when they found the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far away from the area were you when you found the\r\nrifle, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Several feet from it. I don't remember exactly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was it located?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. It was laying down low on the door or on the floor down\r\nbetween some, a very narrow space where boxes were stacked up there,\r\nand there was a space between the boxes, and it was laying down there\r\nin between it, like it had been stuck in there hurriedly, and possibly\r\njust before whoever laid it there went down the stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you found of significance in the building at\r\nall or not?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do the rest of the afternoon?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Well, we proceeded to search the building after that,\r\nand we spent, I don't know the exact amount of time we spent in the\r\nbuilding after that, but when Lieutenant Jack Revill was satisfied, we\r\nwent back downstairs and I went back out to my motorcycle and to my\r\nimmediate superior officer and received another assignment.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have anything to do with the investigation of the\r\nassassination that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about on Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir. My primary job was traffic control.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have anything to do with the investigation of\r\nOfficer Tippit's murder?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything that you can think of that might in any\r\nway be relevant to the assassination of the President or the shooting\r\nof Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Not that I can think of; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sir, I want to thank you very much for coming on down here.\r\n\r\nYou have an opportunity, if you like, to come back and read the\r\ndeposition and sign it, or else you can waive the signing of it and\r\nhave it sent directly to Washington, whichever you prefer.\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. It don't matter. Whichever you prefer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We have no preference.\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Okay, you send it on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you want to waive the signing of it?\r\n\r\nMr. BREWER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF D. V. HARKNESS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of D. V. Harkness was taken at 11:30 a.m., on April 9,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W.

Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I had started west on Main Street to the, I don't know\r\nwhat they call this area here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Plaza.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. On the plaza area with the crowd to observe the President\r\nas he went west on Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after you heard those noises? Did you know\r\nthey were shots, by the way?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. When I saw the first shot and the President's car slow\r\ndown to almost a stop----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you saw the first shot, what do you mean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. When I heard the first shot and saw the President's car\r\nalmost come to a stop and some of the agents piling off the car, I went\r\nback to the intersection to get my motorcycle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were in the process of doing that when you heard the\r\nsecond and third shots?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did the shots sound like they came from?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I couldn't tell. They were bouncing off the buildings\r\ndown there. I couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the reverberations?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I went west on Main to observe the area between the\r\nrailroad tracks and Industrial.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why did you go down there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. By the way the people, when I went into this area,\r\neverybody was hitting the ground, and someone led us to indicate that\r\nthe shots were coming into the cars.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean from some point in front of the cars?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know who that someone was?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did that person do that indicated that?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I went down to Industrial to see if I could see anyone\r\nfleeing that area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I didn't see anyone, so I come back to the front of the\r\nBook Depository and went around to this fence that was across the\r\nstreet from Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean across the street from Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Again, I will have to--near the railroad track.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Behind the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir; this area right here. See, Elm Street goes down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What you are really saying----\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. This area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are pointing to a place between what would be the\r\nextension of Elm that doesn't go down into the parkway but the actual\r\nextension of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes; to the plaza area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The plaza area?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you find there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I found a little colored boy, Amos Euins, who told me he\r\nsaw the shots come from that building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you just picked out a little small book, one of those\r\nlittle pocket notebooks?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Or a notepad from your pocket here. Is that the original\r\nnotation that you made?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you make that notation?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Immediately after the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that your own record that you have kept in your\r\npossession since then?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir. I turned----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You turned what?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. After I took his name and address and put this\r\ninformation on the radio, I then took him on the back of my three-wheel\r\nmotorcycle and put him in Inspector Sawyer's car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you mentioned that you put something on the radio here,\r\nand I hand you here what has been marked as Sawyer Deposition Exhibit\r\nA. Before doing that, do you remember what call number you used, you\r\nwere using on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I believe 260.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, I notice here that there is a call with a notation at\r\n12:36 p.m., 260 to 531. 531 is your office in the main station?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What does it say there on that transcript?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. \"Witness says shots came from fifth floor, Texas Book\r\nDepository store at Houston and Elm. I have him with me now and we are\r\nsealing off the building.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, that was at 12:36 p.m.?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had the building been sealed off at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Not to my knowledge. There were several officers around\r\nit, but I don't know whether it had been sealed off or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the process of sealing off the building, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Asked for a squad.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did it take you after that to have the back part\r\nsealed off?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. The squad was arriving by the time I got off my\r\nmotorcycle. There was already additional squads en route.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How soon after 12:36 p.m., would you say the building was\r\nsealed off?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. It was sealed off then because I was back there and two\r\nother men.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are talking about the back part of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the front part of the building? When was that\r\nsealed off?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Inspector Sawyer and two officers were there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the time you got around to the front part of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir; by the time I put the witness in his car, I\r\nwent immediately to the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, as I understand the sequence, you first went\r\nto the back of the building and had that sealed off first, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You tell me what happened then.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I had this witness with me. I didn't want to lose this\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. So I took him to the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To Inspector Sawyer's car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. To Inspector Sawyer's car, which was right in front.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which was parked in front of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. And left the witness there and went around to the back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On whose radio did you call? Did you call in before or after\r\nyou left the witness in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I don't remember in exact sequence there, but it was in\r\nthe process of going to the car there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. See, here is the thing. The radio traffic was heavy at\r\nthe time, and it depended on how long you had to wait to get in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, in any event, after you made the call, what did\r\nyou do on the radio? And after you got the man in the car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The witness in the car, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Stayed at the back of the building until I was relieved\r\nby a squad.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you then went to the back of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you were at Inspector Sawyer's car, did you see him\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he at his car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir; he was by his car, near his car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not he had gone inside the building\r\nyet?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you don't know?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Don't know whether he had gone in or not. Actually, he\r\nwas standing there in front taking information. All the information was\r\nbeing funneled to Inspector Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you tell him you had a witness?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In his car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At that time, had the building been sealed off yet when you\r\ntold him that?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you told Inspector Sawyer that you had a witness that\r\nsaid the shot came from the building, up to that particular moment, had\r\nthe front part of the building been sealed off yet?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It had already been sealed off?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. There was two officers with Inspector Sawyer at the front.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were they stopping people from going in and out?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir; I don't know that, because I didn't go up and\r\ntalk to them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice whether or not people were coming in and out\r\nof the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No. I was interested in getting around to the back of the\r\nbuilding to make sure it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then am I correct that your testimony is that you didn't\r\nnotice whether people were coming in and out? Did you notice, or did\r\nyou not notice whether people were coming out of the building at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Several officers at the area, and it was a lot of people\r\naround. I don't know whether they were going in or out or not. I\r\ncouldn't say that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went around to the back of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was anyone around in the back when you got there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. There were some Secret Service agents there. I didn't get\r\nthem identified. They told me they were Secret Service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then did you stay around the back of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes; I stayed at the back until the squad got there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I went back to the front, and Inspector Sawyer--helped to\r\nget the crowd back first, and then Inspector Sawyer assigned me to some\r\nfreight cars that were leaving out of the yard, to go down and search\r\nall freight cars that were leaving the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Well, we got a long freight that was in there, and we\r\npulled some people off of there and took them to the station.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean some transients?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Tramps and hoboes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That were on the freight car?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. That was all my assignment, because they shook two long\r\nfreights down that were leaving, to my knowledge, in all the area there.\r\n\r\nWe had several officers working in that area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not anyone found any suspicious\r\npeople of any kind or nature down there in the railroad yard?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir. We made some arrests, I put some people in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were these what you call hoboes or tramps?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were all those questioned?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir; they were taken to the station and questioned.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any guns of any kind found?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I want to go back to this Amos Euins. Do you remember what\r\nhe said to you and what you said to him when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I went in that crowd up there near the area there, and\r\nasked did anyone see any place where the shots come from, and there was\r\nan unidentified person pointed to him, said this boy here saw it, saw\r\nthe shots, where the shots came from, and he told me it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. He told me that the shots came from the window under the\r\nledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Of what building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Of the School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now have you since gone back to that building?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know where the ledge is?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir; let's see, I have been by the place a million\r\ntimes. The ledge there is the one window where it came from, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can't right now definitely state what floor the ledge\r\nwould be?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If you can't, I would rather not have you guess, but if you\r\ndo know, I would like to have you state.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I believe that it----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sergeant, now, do you know where that ledge is now?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Between what floors is the ledge?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. The ledge is between, over the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, well here in your police report I show you Sawyer\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, you said the, \"Witness says shots came from fifth\r\nfloor Texas School Book Depository.\" Did the witness say it was from\r\nthe sixth floor, or did he say it was from the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. He said it was from the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were the exact words of the witness?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. The exact words of the witness \"It was under the ledge,\"\r\nwhich would put it on the sixth floor. It was my error in a hasty count\r\nof the floors.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the witness say what particular window on that floor\r\nthat he saw it on?\r\n\r\nOn the floor under the ledge?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Said it was the last window, which would indicate it\r\nwould be the last window on the east side of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say to his right as he saw it, or did he just say the\r\nlast window from where he was standing?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Last window from where he was standing, and at that point\r\nit would indicate that it would be the last window on the east side of\r\nthe building facing Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you standing at the time, on the north or south side of\r\nElm when you talked to this witness?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you were with this witness, had this Amos Euins, were\r\nyou standing on the north or the south side of Elm as it goes into the\r\nParkway there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Elm as it goes under the Parkway--was between Elm where\r\nit goes under the triple underpass, and the extension of Elm there in\r\nthat park area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So that is where you were standing?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So that would be north of Elm as it goes into the underpass,\r\nbut south of the extension of Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Where that building is, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you have been west of the School Book Depository\r\nBuilding at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So the witness pointed to the last one on that floor? That\r\nwould be the last one which would be to the east, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can remember this witness said?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say whether or not he saw a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. He couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sergeant, do you remember anything else that you said?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you actually talk to any other person whose name you\r\nrecorded in your little book there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir; Arnold Rowland.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Arnold Rowland?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. He said that he saw a man on one of those floors. He\r\ndidn't clearly identify it, as he saw a man with a high-powered rifle\r\nwalking around up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything else that you could have recorded there?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Except his address. I have his address as 3026 Hammerly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that happened that day that might in\r\nany way be relevant to this investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do on Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Saturday I was assigned to traffic at Elm and Houston,\r\nbetween Elm and Main.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you did on Saturday or on Sunday\r\nthat might in any way be relevant to this area of inquiry?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. On Saturday had a large crowd down there, and I observed\r\nJack Ruby at the entrance of the jail down there on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw Jack Ruby near the entrance of the jail on Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Has your statement already been taken by anyone before on\r\nthe President's Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But you did see Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I testified in Ruby's trial to that effect.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone else or anything else that might be in any way\r\nrelevant here?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. The only thing, on Sunday I was leaving town; going to\r\nWhitesboro, and my wife and kids, we heard over the radio that Oswald\r\nhad been shot.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Whitesboro, I called Capt. Fritz of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, and told him that I had seen Ruby near the entrance of the\r\ncounty jail the day before, which was a Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But did you ever talk to Ruby at any time afterwards?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir; not afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you know Ruby at all, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I had met him, and being downtown traffic sergeant, I had\r\nseen him before, and I knew who he was, but other than that, that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any other thing you can think of, whether I have\r\nasked it or not, that might in any way be relevant to the investigation\r\nof the assassination or the shooting of Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir; I don't have anything on that, other than what I\r\nheard over the radio.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the way, did your witness ever say whether the person he\r\nsaw at the window was a white man or Negro?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. He just told me, he just said he couldn't identify him.\r\nThat is what he told me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he tell you whether or not it was a man?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I don't remember, because I knew I couldn't get any\r\ninformation out of him, enough to put out a description on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sir, we want to thank you very much for coming down here and\r\ntestifying.\r\n\r\nYou have an opportunity, if you would like, to come back and read your\r\ndeposition when it is typed, and sign it, or you can waive reading and\r\nsigning it and just have the court reporter send the transcript to us\r\ndirectly in Washington. If you have any preference, you might let us\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I have no preference. I just hope I have been able to\r\nhelp you on these directions, because they are complicated to give\r\ndirections, especially when you try to convince.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In any event, do you want to sign or waive signing? You have\r\na right to sign or you can waive the signing of it and send it directly\r\nto us, whatever you want to do.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. Waiver is customary? It doesn't make any difference.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Some people do one way and some the other way. Do you want\r\nto come back and read it and sign it, or do you want to waive signing\r\nit and let the court reporter send us the transcript direct?\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. What has most of them been doing?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Gosh, I have them doing both ways. I couldn't tell you what\r\nmost have been doing, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. HARKNESS. I will just waive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF J. HERBERT SAWYER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of J. Herbert Sawyer was taken at 3:45 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you stand and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Inspector of Police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Of what Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You live here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Inspector, how long have you been with the Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. 23 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be then you came to the Police Department around\r\n1941 or so?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. 1941, is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been with them ever since 1941?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Except for a brief hitch in the Service during the war.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do in the Service?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I was a yeoman in the Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Honorable discharge?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Prior to going into the Service, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Policeman.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before you went into the Service?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to school here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Graduated from high school?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes. I didn't graduate. I lacked half a year.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you got out and you went in--did you go right on the\r\npolice force then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I worked as credit manager in a jewelry company. This was\r\nimmediately prior to coming to the police department.\r\n\r\nBefore that, I was a doorman at the Mural Room of the Baker Hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you first got out of high school, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I went out to California and went to work as a clerk in a\r\ngrocery store.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Came back to Dallas and went to Business College, and then\r\nI went to work as a doorman at the Mural Room of the Baker Hotel.\r\n\r\nAnd then from there I went to the jewelry, and later became credit\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then after that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Then to the Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been with the Police Department ever since except\r\nfor this time in the Navy?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. 47.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are married?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Inspector, were you on duty on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the way, were you an Inspector at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you stationed with reference to the motorcade?\r\nJust what were your duties?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I had charge of the crowd detail on Main Street from Akard\r\nto Harwood.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After the motorcade passed, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I headed west on Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you immediately get in your car after the motorcade\r\npassed?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, not immediately, because the crowd was real thick and\r\ncompletely surrounded the car, but I did as soon as it was feasible to\r\nget back in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember where your car was parked?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes. It was parked on Ervay Street, at the intersection\r\nof Ervay and Main, but it was, well, it was on the north side of Main\r\nStreet on Ervay.\r\n\r\nIt run parallel to Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you got in your car shortly after the motorcade\r\npassed then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, I headed west, or tried to. I had to wait until the\r\ncrowd cleared out, and as soon as the crowd cleared enough, I headed\r\nwest on Main Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any particular reason why you headed west on Main Street?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Because that was the way the car was pointed at the time I\r\ngot in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then what did you do as you went west on Main\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I just went real slow down the street because of people\r\ncrossing, and at the time, the radio broadcast came in about a lot of\r\nactivity down at the lower end around Houston and Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what radio broadcast this is?\r\n\r\nWho broadcast it?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I heard Sheriff Decker come on the radio and tell the\r\ndispatcher to get all of his men over to, and I thought he said Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository, but at least that was the overall gist of the\r\nconversation. That is what I gathered. He may not have said Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository, but the Texas School Book Depository was\r\nmentioned in the broadcasts that were made at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was this on Channel 1 or Channel 2 if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Channel 2, I am sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Sheriff Decker have any particular call number at all,\r\nor not, in your police number system?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No. I was wondering why he come on our radio, but then I\r\nthink that he was with Chief Curry and probably using that radio.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, in any event, a call was made from Chief Curry's\r\ncar?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, this I don't know either. I don't know what car it\r\nwas made from, but I think it was Sheriff Decker talking. I could\r\nrecognize his voice, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Then I went on down to the Texas Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you park your car?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. In front of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In front of the main entrance there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. In front of the main entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Immediately went into--well, talked to some of the officers\r\naround there who told me the story that they had thought some shots\r\nhad come from one of the floors in the building, and I think the fifth\r\nfloor was mentioned, but nobody seemed to know who the shots were\r\ndirected at or what had actually happened, except there had been a\r\nshooting there at the time the President's motorcade had gone by.\r\n\r\nAnd I went with a couple of officers and a man who I believed worked in\r\nthe building. The elevator was just to the right of the main entrance,\r\nand we went to the top floor, which was pointed out to me by this other\r\nman as being the floor that we were talking about. We had talked about\r\nthe fifth floor.\r\n\r\nAnd we went back to the storage area and looked around and didn't see\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you took an elevator up, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The route that you took to the elevator, you went to the\r\nfront door?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. We got into the elevator. We run into this man.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, when you say you got into the elevator, where was the\r\nelevator as you walked in the front door?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. It was to the right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To the right?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it a freight elevator or a passenger elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. The best of my recollection, it was a passenger elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you push for the top button in that elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, I don't know who pushed it, but we went up to the top\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went up to the top floor that the elevator would go to?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got off, and were there officers there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. There was one or two other officers with me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you got off, you say you went into the back there\r\ninto a warehouse area?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Storage area; what appeared to be a storage area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go into any place other than a warehouse or storage\r\narea?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there anything other than a warehouse or storage area\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, to one side I could see an office over there with\r\npeople in it. Some women that apparently were office workers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now Inspector, what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, I didn't see anything that was out of the ordinary,\r\nso I immediately came back downstairs to check the security on the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say check the security on the building, what do you\r\nmean by that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, to be sure it was covered off properly, and then\r\nposted two men on the front entrance with instructions not to let\r\nanyone in or out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the rear entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, I also had the sergeant go around and check to be\r\nsure that all of those were covered, although he told me that they were\r\nalready covered.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When was the order given to cover the front entrance of the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, they had it covered when I got there. There were\r\nofficers all around the front. The only thing I don't think had been\r\ndone by the time I got there, was the instructions not to let anybody\r\nin or out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, did you give the instructions not to let\r\nanyone in or out?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you give those instructions before or after you came\r\ndown from the fourth floor or top floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. After I got down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So your procedure, if I understand it, was this. You were\r\ndriving on Main Street when you heard Sheriff Decker on the radio?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Inspector, to try and reconstruct the time of sealing off\r\nthe building, I believe you said that before you got to the building,\r\nor at about the time you got to the building, you thought that you\r\nheard something about the Texas School Book Depository over the radio?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At least some time before you left your car, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes; it would have to be, in order to hear it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, I have with me the transcript of the radio log here of\r\nNovember 22, and I notice that, according to the log, at 12:30, and you\r\nhave examined it, there appears there is a statement by Chief Curry,\r\nand then something by Sheriff Decker concerning, well, we'd better call\r\nthis Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit A, which is a transcript of the radio\r\nlog, and it reads right now--we will try and restaple it later on--but\r\nright now, Page 2 and 3 are reversed insofar as the order is concerned.\r\n\r\nYou see at 12:28 p.m., on this exhibit Curry calls in that they are\r\nnear the triple underpass, and then at 12:30 p.m., it says, \"Station\r\nBreak,\" is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then the next thing that goes on, it is Number 1, which is\r\nChief Curry's number, am I correct in that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then according to the transcript, the statement is made--you\r\nmight just read it here in front of you: \"Go to the hospital, officers,\r\nParkland Hospital, have them stand by. Get men on top of the underpass,\r\nsee what happened up there, go up to the overpass. Have Parkland stand\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\nYou see these words here, Inspector Sawyer?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then on a continuation, \"Dallas-1,\" which is marked in by\r\nsomeone as Sheriff Decker says: \"I'm sure it's going to take some time\r\nto get your men in there. Put every one of my men there.\"\r\n\r\nThen there is a call back to Curry from 531, which is your home\r\nstation, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nI really didn't quite understand all of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then Curry is quoted as saying: \"Notify Station 5 to move\r\nall men available out of my department back into the railroad yard\r\nand try to determine what happened and hold everything secure until\r\nhomicide and other investigators can get in there.\"\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That is Decker speaking there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is Decker?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You believe that is what Decker said?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That is what he said, yes, that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. His number is Dallas-1, and they are talking to 1. They\r\nhave that confused.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, Curry is 1 also?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But I think they were riding in the same car?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That might be correct, but this is actually Decker's voice\r\nhere, and that is what he had to say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, then, the comment is made \"Notify Station 5----\"\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That is the Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"To move all men available out of my Department back into\r\nthe railroad yard----\"\r\n\r\nAnd that you feel is Decker talking because of the reference to Station\r\n5?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Also, my memory serves that it was his voice that made that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then, at 12:31, is a notation there that quotes,\r\n\"It looks like the President has been hit.\"\r\n\r\nThen there doesn't appear to be anything pertaining to where the shots\r\nmight have come from until we see at 12:34, there is a call from\r\nofficer, it says No. 136, that states, \"A passer-by states the shots\r\ncame from Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\nThis is the first reference in the log about the Texas School Book\r\nDepository, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you feel that you heard in your car some reference to the\r\nTexas School Book Depository building?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it be fair for me to assume then that you had not at\r\nleast completely left your car by 12:34 p.m?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then when you got to the Texas School Book Depository, well,\r\nyou got out of the car and talked to some people or to some officers?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Officers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And then what did the officers tell you?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That their information was that the shots had come from the\r\nfifth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did any officers give you any other information about the\r\nsource of the shots other than the fact that it came from the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository, at that particular time?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I can't say whether it was officers or who, but there was a\r\nreference also made to the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, in any event--pardon me, do you have anything\r\nelse to add?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Also, there was a broadcast here in the transcript about\r\nthe railroad yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. And this could be part of what I was thinking about, or\r\nwhat I had heard, was this broadcast on the radio about the railroad\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do? You went inside the building, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. We immediately went inside the building. I took--I believe\r\nSgt. Harkness may have gone with me. I am not positive of that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the elevator on the first floor when you got there, or\r\ndid you have to wait for it to come down?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Best of my recollection, it was there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got to the elevator, went up, looked around back there.\r\n\r\nHow long did you spend up there at the top floor that the elevator took\r\nyou to?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Just took a quick look around and made sure there was\r\nnobody hiding on that floor. I doubt if it took over a minute at the\r\nmost.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To go up and look around and come down?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. To look around on the floor. How long it took to go up, it\r\ncouldn't have been over 3 minutes at the most from the time we left,\r\ngot up and back down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then that would put it around no sooner than 12:37, if you\r\nheard the call at 12:34?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you got down and what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I asked the Sergeant to doublecheck the security around the\r\nbuilding, and then I took two patrolmen and stationed them at the front\r\ndoor and told them, with instructions not to let anybody in or out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now up to the time you did this, had anyone else sealed off\r\nthe building, that you know of?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. When I arrived, the sergeant told me he had the building\r\nsealed off. There were officers all around the building.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my recollection, there was no officer actually stationed\r\non the front door, at the front door. There was some on the sidewalk\r\nin front of the front door, and also, as far as I know, had no\r\ninstructions been issued to anyone to let anybody in or out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So yours would have been the first instructions to stop\r\ntraffic from coming in and out of the front door, am I correct in that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, anybody that would have been seen leaving the\r\nbuilding would have been stopped and interrogated by the officers that\r\nwere there?\r\n\r\nEven before you instructed them?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, because they were looking for something or anything,\r\nand I know that anybody coming out of the back doors, from what the\r\nsergeant told me, they would have stopped them, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What happened at the front door now. There were people\r\nstanding out on the area of the steps, were there not?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No. There were some people around, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not any of those would have been\r\nstopped?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. For sure, no; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now after you got down and you issued these orders, then\r\nwhat did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I set up a command post in front. The various officers were\r\nbringing up different witnesses who had seen various things, and I saw\r\nthat this was quite an involved situation. It was so many of these\r\npeople that had information, that I knew I didn't have time to take\r\nthis information down, and by this time several deputy sheriffs were\r\nstanding there, and one of them, I think he was a supervisor, I had his\r\nname at one time, I can't think of it now, was there, and he offered\r\nthe use of an interrogation room of Sheriff Decker's office, I think he\r\nsaid, for interrogating these people.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is located down the street a little bit there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, it is catty-corner across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. It is southeast across the street from the Texas School\r\nBook Depository, at least from the corner, and so we set up a group of\r\nofficers and deputy sheriffs who were to take charge of the witnesses\r\nand take them over to see that affidavits were taken from them.\r\n\r\nThey were more or less an escort service so the witness wouldn't get\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAnd then as our detectives began to show up, I sent them over to the\r\nSheriff's Office to assist in taking these depositions or affidavits.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many witnesses were there around there during this\r\nperiod of time that you talked to?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, during the entire period of time that I was there, I\r\nwould venture to say between 25 to 50 different people had come up with\r\ninformation of one kind or another.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, on this radio log, Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit A, do\r\nyou notice your number there for any calls at all that might have come\r\nin? What number did you use?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I used No. 9. That is my regular call No. 9.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I notice here a No. 9, the first time that appears to come\r\nin here is at 12:40 p.m.; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That is the first one after 12:40, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The first one after 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. The first one after 12:30, yes, that is true.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then at 12:40, there is a bunch of calls at 12:40, with the\r\nnext call number at 12:43, so you assume sometime 12:40 and 12:43 you,\r\nas No. 9, called in, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you read what it says that you said there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. \"We need more manpower down here at the Texas Book\r\nDepository; there should be a bunch on Main if somebody can pick them\r\nup and bring them down here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that said before or after you came down from the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That was after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that before or after you told the men there to guard the\r\nfront door and not let anyone in or out?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That was after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now the next time that No. 9 appears is at what time?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Immediately after 12:43 and before 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you say then?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. \"The wanted person in this is a slender white male about\r\n30, 5 feet 10, 165, carrying what looks to be a 30-30 or some type of\r\nWinchester.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then the statement is made from the home office, \"It was a\r\nrifle?\"\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I answered, \"Yes, a rifle.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then the reply to you, \"Any clothing description?\"\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. \"Current witness can't remember that.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then the statement is made sometime before 12:45 p.m., and\r\nafter the 12:43 p.m., call, \"Attention all squads, description was\r\nbroadcast and no further information at this time.\"\r\n\r\nDoes that mean the description you made was rebroadcast?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I rebroadcast that description. That is what that means.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I then notice on this radio log--I don't see anything more\r\nunder 9, at least until after the, well, it is down until we have gone\r\nas far as 1:30 p.m., I don't see anything else, do you, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No. There is another broadcast in there somewhere, though.\r\nI put out another description on the colored boy that worked in that\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean the colored boy that worked in that\r\ndepository?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. He is one that had a previous record in the narcotics, and\r\nhe was supposed to have been a witness to the man being on that floor.\r\nHe was supposed to have been a witness to Oswald being there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would Charles Givens have been that boy?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, I think that is the name, and I put out a description\r\non him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How do you know he was supposed to be a witness on that?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Somebody told me that. Somebody came to me with the\r\ninformation. And again, that particular party, whoever it was, I don't\r\nknow. I remember that a deputy sheriff came up to me who had been over\r\ntaking these affidavits, that I sent them over there, and he came over\r\nfrom the sheriff's office with a picture and a description of this\r\ncolored boy and he said that he was supposed to have worked at the\r\nTexas Book Depository, and he was the one employee who was missing, or\r\nhe was missing from the building.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't accounted for, and that he was suppose to have some\r\ninformation about the man that did the shooting.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say about the man who did the shooting, did you\r\nknow at that time who did the shooting?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know about what time in the afternoon this was?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Somewhere along in here; let's see if we can't find it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This doesn't go past 1:53 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. What about your other transcript?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I have a transcript of another one here, at least I did have.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I think we caught the man in the crowd later and sent him\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWe sent him directly down to Captain Fritz's office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, just a minute now. I see here on No. 1, you have two\r\nchannels there.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. This is Channel 1, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We will call this Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit B.\r\n\r\nI see here that you go on at 12:45 p.m., with this statement by your\r\nNo. 9. You want to read it?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\n\"From this building it is unknown if he is still there or not. Unknown\r\nif he was there in the first place.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it reads back here, \"All the information we have\r\nreceived, indicates it did come from the fifth or fourth of that\r\nbuilding.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the central headquarters back to you, is that it?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is at least after 12:45 p.m., and before 12:48 p.m.?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now looking down on this log until the next time your number\r\nappears, is 1:12 p.m. What does that say?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. \"We have found empty rifle hulls on the fifth floor and\r\nfrom all indications the man had been there for some time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then is there anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. This was reported to me by somebody inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That was at 1:12 p.m., that the hulls were found, or\r\nat least shortly prior to that? This doesn't say anything else.\r\nIt apparently doesn't go in detail much past 1:58 p.m., on Sawyer\r\nDeposition Exhibit B, and 1:53 p.m., on Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you still feel sometime after that you might have called\r\nout another description?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. It was another, sometime after that, or it has been left\r\nout of this. I don't think it has been left out of this, but it must\r\nhave been after 1:53.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, sir; you did broadcast that description out\r\nof this man?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, that's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That shows on the radio log. Where did you get that\r\ndescription from?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. We are talking now about the colored man?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No, I am talking about the one that is on Sawyer's\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, that shows you at 12:43.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. That description came to me mainly from one witness who\r\nclaimed to have seen the rifle barrel in the fifth or sixth floor of\r\nthe building, and claimed to have been able to see the man up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know this person's name?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I do not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know anything about him, what he was wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Except that he was--I don't remember what he was wearing. I\r\nremember that he was a white man and that he wasn't young and he wasn't\r\nold. He was there. That is the only two things that I can remember\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What age would you categorize as young?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Around 35 would be my best recollection of it, but it could\r\nbe a few years either way.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if he was tall or short, or can't you\r\nremember anything about him?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I can't remember that much about him. I was real hazy about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember where he said he was standing when he saw\r\nthe person with the rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I didn't go into detail with him except that from the best\r\nof my recollection, he was standing where he could have seen him. But\r\nthere were too many people coming up with questions to go into detail.\r\nI got the description and sent him on over to the Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Inspector, do you remember anything else about this person\r\nwho you say gave you the primary description?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No, I do not, except that I did send him with an escort to\r\nthe Sheriff's Office to give fuller or more complete detail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know if he was taken there to see a lineup at the\r\npolice station?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him again?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you talked to other people there that said they had\r\nsome information with regard to where the shots may have come from?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes, through a number of people.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. First I am going to ask you if you talked to any other\r\npeople who said they saw a rifle or part of a rifle?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes. There were a few who claimed that they had seen this.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did these people that claimed they saw a rifle or part\r\nof a rifle----\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. The ones that I talked to were pointing out one of the\r\nupper floors of the Texas School Book Depository, which at that time I\r\nthought was the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know what portion, what side of the building it was?\r\n\r\nWas it the northeast corner or west side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. It was on the south side of the building, and in the\r\nsoutheast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about this person, who I will call the primary\r\ndescription witness, did he say what side of the building it was on?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. He went and pointed out the window which I now note to be\r\nthe sixth floor, but when I talked to him, I thought it was the fifth\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. On the south side of the building, and the southeast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk to any witness, or did any witness talk to you\r\nwho claimed to see any rifle or portion of a rifle at any place other\r\nthan a window of Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No, did any----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did any officer give you any information about talking to\r\nanyone who saw a rifle or a portion of a rifle at any place other than\r\na window in the Texas School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No, not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk to people who attempted to locate the shots\r\non the basis of what I would call their sense of hearing, rather than\r\ntheir sense of sight?\r\n\r\nIn other words, what they heard rather than what they saw?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Correct. That is correct. Some of them claimed that they\r\nhad heard shots, or thought they heard shots from over the overpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did all the people you talked to say that they heard shots\r\nover the overpass? Claim they had some knowledge about where the shots\r\ncame from?\r\n\r\nDid they all say they heard shots from the overpass, or did they say\r\nthey heard some from other places?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No. Very few said they heard the shots come from the\r\noverpass, or thought they heard them from that area.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, where did other people say they heard shots come from?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Most of the people that heard the shots pointed out the\r\nTexas Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did some of the people that heard shots, or thought they\r\nheard shots from the Texas School Book Depository, all say they saw a\r\nrifle there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Most of them say they saw a rifle there?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No, just a few, very few.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else you can think of that occurred at the\r\nTexas School Book Depository that afternoon while you were there that\r\nmight have any relevancy about where the shots came from, other than\r\nwhat you have told thus far?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Well, I had heard some of the officers come to me and said\r\nthere was supposed to be, somebody told them about a woman that had\r\ntaken some pictures of that window, and then one of the sergeants came\r\nto me, and I am not sure who the sergeant is now, but anyway he said\r\nthat there was on the building immediately west--east, I am sorry--east\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository, that a man up in one of the upper\r\nwindows up there was taking some moving pictures of what had gone on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever contact this man? Do you know what his name is?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No; I don't know his name. The sergeant told me that the\r\nman would not give them the pictures, that he was waiting for the\r\nSecret Service or the FBI, I forget which now, and I sent the sergeant\r\nand two men back over there with instructions to bring that man and his\r\npictures to me.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back over there, Forrest Sorrels of the Secret Service\r\nwas already there, and at least they so reported back to me, and was\r\ntalking to this man.\r\n\r\nSo I told them to go ahead with their normal assignments and since\r\nForrest was already there and talking to him, I knew that that part\r\nwould be taken care of.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know what his name was or what the results of it\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Later that afternoon one of our colored officer detectives\r\nsaw this colored man in this crowd across the street and we had\r\npreviously broadcast a description on, and he took him into custody and\r\nsent him immediately down to Captain Fritz' office.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He gave a statement, is that it?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. This I don't know. I presume he did, but I didn't stop to\r\ntalk to him or take any information.\r\n\r\nI just sent him on down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of at this time?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You spent most of the afternoon out in front of the building\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I spent most of the afternoon up until 4 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I went back down to the City Hall and checked around there\r\nto see if anything further I could do, and then I went home.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do on Saturday, the 23d? Anything that has to\r\ndo with the assassination or the investigation of the Tippit murder?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. No. I happened to be off on Saturday, and I didn't go back\r\ndown. The boss didn't call me, so I stayed home.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about Sunday?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Same thing. In fact, I didn't even hear about the other\r\nthing until way late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any other information that you can think of,\r\nwhether I have asked it or not, that might be in any way relevant here?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. The only other thing I can remember that I did down there,\r\nwas when the shooting on Officer Tippit came in, I released half a\r\ndozen men to go to Oak Cliff to help with that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Inspector, is there anything else that you can think of,\r\nwhether I have asked it or not, that is in any way relevant here?\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. I can't think of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sir, we certainly appreciate your cooperation in coming down\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nYou have a right, if you would like, after this report is typewritten,\r\nto read it and sign it before it is sent to us, or you can waive the\r\nreading of it and have it sent to us directly.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make a bit of difference to us.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Whichever you prefer. It doesn't make any difference to me.\r\n\r\nI would like to read it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why don't we say you read it and sign it, and it will be\r\nsent to us.\r\n\r\nMr. SAWYER. Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF GERALD DALTON HENSLEE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Gerald Dalton Henslee was taken at 4 p.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sergeant, do you want to stand and raise your right hand,\r\nplease, to be sworn.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you please state your name.\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Gerald Dalton Henslee.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. A police officer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For what police department?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. City of Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long have you been a police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. 16 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are a sergeant now?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Sergeant.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do before you became a police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I was a student in SMU.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At SMU?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Prior to that time?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I was a dance instructor at the Arthur Murray Dance Studio.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And prior to that?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I was in the United States Army.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Honorable discharge, sir?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. 40.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Married?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sergeant, what were your duties on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I was supervising the radio dispatcher's office at the\r\nDallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you just describe your duties there as to what they\r\nincluded?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Well, in this instance, I was not only supervising the\r\nchannel 1 radio and the incoming radio calls, but was the police\r\ndispatcher for channel 2, covering the special event of the arrival of\r\nthe President of the United States, President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were your hours of work that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. My assigned hours?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. 6:30 until 2 p.m. 6:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you stay on after that?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. I stayed until about 5:30, as I recall, approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mentioned channel 2. How many channels do you have?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Two channels.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was channel 2 being used for the motorcade that day?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am going to hand you what has been marked Sawyer\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, and ask you to state if you know what this is?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes. This is a transcript of the radio log of that date.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For what channel?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Channel 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Covering from?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. From 10:25 a.m., until 1:53 p.m.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now I notice on the covering page it says that: \"The\r\nfollowing was recorded on channel 2, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. This report\r\nincludes information prior to the arrival of the President's plane,\r\nprogress of the motorcade, the shooting, and the escort to Parkland\r\nHospital. Also included are events concerning the shooting of Officer\r\nTippit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you attempted to cover all calls that occurred that day\r\nor just the calls pertaining to the subject matter that is included in\r\nthe covering paragraph.\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Pertaining to the subject matter, to the covering\r\nparagraph only.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, I hand you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition\r\nExhibit B, and ask you to state if you know what this is?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is Sawyer Deposition Exhibit B?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That is a transmission pertaining to the shooting of\r\nPresident Kennedy and Officer Tippit on channel 1.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, I notice times on Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A\r\nand B. Does this mean a time according to your police clock there when\r\nan event happened?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For instance, on Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A, I see until\r\n12:40 p.m., a number of conversations. Then the next one is 12:43 p.m.\r\nDoes that mean that all the conversations took place between 12:40 and\r\n12:43 p.m.?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. They took place in the order in which they are listed here?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Right. There were so many, we couldn't get the time in\r\nafter each transmission.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who prepared Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A and B, if you know?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Well, I am pretty sure these are the ones I prepared. They\r\nare copies of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know from what source they were prepared?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. They were prepared from the tapes on the channel 1. We\r\nhave a tape on channel 1, and we have a record on channel 2. Two\r\nseparate tape records, but they are prepared from those records and\r\ntapes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Under your supervision?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I notice numbers here. For instance, I see on Sawyer\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, the No. 531 often appears. Would that be your\r\ncall number?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. This designates the radio dispatcher.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then I see the number here, No. 1 sometimes appears. Who is\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That is the number assigned to Chief J. E. Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I see a No. 9. Who is No. 9?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That is the number assigned to Inspector J. H. Sawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Different numbers are assigned to different people?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If an officer is patrolling a district, does he have the\r\nnumber assigned to a district if he is not a high officer in the\r\nDepartment?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For instance, I see the No. 78 here. Does that appear to be\r\nthe number of J. D. Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. On that particular day it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, anything else you can think of, Sergeant, that\r\nmight be relevant to the investigation into the assassination of the\r\nPresident or the shooting of Officer Tippit?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. No. The only thing I have is what I observed over the\r\npolice radio that day. That is all the knowledge I have at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, sir; we thank you very much for your cooperation.\r\n\r\nOne other thing, you have the right to read this deposition and sign it\r\nbefore it goes into Washington, or else you can waive the reading and\r\nhave it go directly to Washington.\r\n\r\nDo you have any preference?\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. Yes, I would like to read it before I sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is all right. It makes no difference to us. And again,\r\nwe thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. HENSLEE. What else can I do for you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. SHELLEY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of William H. Shelley was taken at 4:10 p.m., on April\r\n7, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\n(Witness complying.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give here today\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Sit down and state your name and your address.\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. William Hoyt (spelling) Shelley, 126 South Tatum, Dallas\r\n11.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were\r\nborn and----\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I was born at Gunter, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your education?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. High school.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What have you been doing since then?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I worked in defense plants a little bit during the war and\r\nstarted working at the Texas School Book Depository October 29, 1945.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. (After leaving room for last answer, Mr. Ball returns.) Did\r\nyou tell her all about yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. You wanted to know when I was born.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told us that, and you had your high school education?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work have you done since then?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I've told her.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you worked at Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. She already has it, October 29, 1945.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. October 29, 1945--steady since that date?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In November 1963, what was your job down there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, I am manager of the miscellaneous department and\r\nhave been for several years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is your immediate superior?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Roy S. Truly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his job?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He is superintendent of the place.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He worked for me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work did he do for you?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He did good work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He did good work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Order filling.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As an order filler did he have access to any more than one\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many floors?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Just about any of them outside the offices.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there certain floors that he worked more upon which he\r\nworked more frequently than other floors?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. The first floor is where all the order filling is done;\r\nthe 5th, 6th, 7th floor are used for storage and when they need stock\r\non the first floor anybody goes up and gets it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So he would work mostly on the first floor and sometimes on\r\n5, 6, and 7, is that what you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever talk to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Not too much; he wasn't too talkative. If I had something\r\nI wanted him to do, I would tell him and he usually did it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. His work was satisfactory?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November 1963, did you see him come to work\r\nthat morning?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, he was at work when I got there already filling orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him from time to time during that day?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I am sure I did. I do remember seeing him when I came down\r\nto eat lunch about 10 to 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where had you been working?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I had been on the sixth floor with the boys laying that\r\nfloor that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you go down and eat lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. It was around 10 'til.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, I started eating.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you start eating it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. In my office next to Mr. Truly's and I ate part of it\r\nwhich I do usually and finish up later on in the day but I went outside\r\nthen to the front.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why did you go to the front?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Oh, several people were out there waiting to watch the\r\nmotorcade and I went out to join them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And who was out there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, there was Lloyd Viles of McGraw-Hill, Sarah Stanton,\r\nshe's with Texas School Book, and Wesley Frazier and Billy Lovelady\r\njoined us shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were standing where?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Just outside the glass doors there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be on the top landing of the entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the motorcade pass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, I heard something sounded like it was a firecracker\r\nand a slight pause and then two more a little bit closer together.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I didn't think anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did it sound like to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Sounded like a miniature cannon or baby giant firecracker,\r\nwasn't real loud.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What happened; what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I didn't do anything for a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What seemed to be the direction or source of the sound?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Sounded like it came from the west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It sounded like it came from the west?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Gloria Calvary from South-Western Publishing Co. ran\r\nback up there crying and said \"The President has been shot\" and Billy\r\nLovelady and myself took off across the street to that little, old\r\nisland and we stopped there for a minute.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Across the street, you mean directly south?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, slightly to the right, you know where the light is\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. That little, old side street runs in front of our building\r\nand Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It dead ends?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. There's concrete between the two streets.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Elm Street dead ends there just beyond the building, doesn't\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, that's also Elm that goes under the triple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is Elm that goes under the triple underpass?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went to the concrete between the two Elm Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, where they split.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went out there and then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, officers started running down to the railroad yards\r\nand Billy and I walked down that way.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you get down that way; what course did you take?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. We walked down the middle of the little street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The dead-end street?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Truly, Mr. Truly and an officer go into the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yeah, we saw them right at the front of the building while\r\nwe were on the island.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. While you were out there before you walked to the railroad\r\nyards?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have any idea how long it was from the time you heard\r\nthose three sounds or three noises until you saw Truly and Baker going\r\ninto the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. It would have to be 3 or 4 minutes I would say because\r\nthis girl that ran back up there was down near where the car was when\r\nthe President was hit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She ran back up to the door and you had still remained\r\nstanding there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Going to watch the rest of the parade were you?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The Vice President hadn't gone by, had he, by your place?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I don't know. I didn't recognize him. I did recognize Mr.\r\nKennedy and his suntan I had been hearing about.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to see Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. We ran out on the island while some of the people that\r\nwere out watching it from our building were walking back and we turned\r\naround and we saw an officer and Truly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see them go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No; we didn't watch that long but they were at the first\r\nstep like they were fixin' to go in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they moving at the time, walking or running?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Well, they were moving, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were they running?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. That, I couldn't swear to; there were so many people\r\naround.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you and Billy Lovelady do?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. We walked on down to the first railroad track there on\r\nthe dead-end street and stood there and watched them searching cars\r\ndown there in the parking lots for a little while and then we came in\r\nthrough our parking lot at the west end.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the west end?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; and then in the side door into the shipping room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you came into the shipping room did you see anybody?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I saw Eddie Piper.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He was coming back from where he was watching the\r\nmotorcade in the southwest corner of the shipping room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of the first floor of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who else did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. That's all we saw immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see Vickie Adams?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I saw her that day but I don't remember where I saw her.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't remember whether you saw her when you came back?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. It was after we entered the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think you did see her after you entered the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; I thought it was on the fourth floor awhile\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did the police come into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; they started coming in pretty fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go with them any place?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; Mr. Truly left me guarding the elevator, not to let\r\nanybody up and down the elevator or stairway and some plainclothesmen\r\ncame in; I don't know whether they were Secret Service or FBI or what\r\nbut they wanted me to take them upstairs, so we went up and started\r\nsearching the various floors.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go up on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you there when they found anything up there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I was, I believe I was on the sixth floor when they found\r\nthe gun but we were searching all parts of that floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you find any chicken bones up there or see any?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, I went up later on that day; I believe after we had\r\ngotten back from City Hall with someone, I don't remember who it was,\r\none of the officers and they got them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They did what?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. They got the bones.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were they?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. They were on the third--yeah, it would be the third window\r\nfrom the southeast corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were they in a sack?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Laying on a sack.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Laying on a sack.\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; with a coke bottle sitting in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any other chicken bones anyplace around there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's the only ones?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. That's all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody eating fried chicken on that floor that\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. At one time I think I said I did but Charles Givens was\r\nthe guy that was eating and he was further on over toward the west\r\nside and he was eating a sandwich so he says.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now you say that you thought that you had seen someone had\r\neaten fried chicken that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I thought I had; those colored boys are always eating\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you think you did or do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I asked Charles Givens whether it was him that was eating\r\nand he said it was a sandwich.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that before you went down for lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; it was pretty early in the morning, about 9:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. It was two-thirds across the building toward the west\r\nbecause I didn't put plywood over there and he didn't get too far from\r\nwhere we were actually working.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After you heard these noises you said sounded like\r\nfirecrackers this girl came up and said the President was shot?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were still standing there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There was still some time lapse from the time you heard the\r\nnoise like a firecracker and she came up?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went out across Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, to the divider.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Between the two Elm Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The one street dead ends and the other street that goes on\r\ndown under the viaduct?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you run out to the point or walk out?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I believe we trotted out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay very long?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Oh, it wasn't very long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Maybe a minute or two.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that's the place you saw Truly and Baker, you say, going\r\ninto the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went down the Elm Street that dead ends to the first\r\nrailroad track?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's about what distance?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Approximately 100 yards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you trot, run or walk?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. We were walking but it was a pretty fast walk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay there any length of time?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Not very long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long would you say?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I wouldn't say over a minute or minute and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went back to the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you trot or run back to the building?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. We just walked back; took our good, old easy time more or\r\nless.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you went into the west end?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Vickie Adams after you came into the building and\r\ndid you see her on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I sure don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't.\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Oswald use a clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On which he kept his orders?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is it a clipboard you gave him to use or one----\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. It's one he picked up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Picked up where?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Just laying around.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There are clipboards that the order fillers use there?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yeah, some of them are on bakelite and some we just use a\r\nclip and maybe a piece of cardboard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he use the same one at all times?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; as far as I know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now at a later time do you remember a clipboard being found?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know who found it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Frankie Kaiser.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did he find it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He found it on the sixth floor in the corner of the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he show you the place?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Point it out to you?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; so I invited Mr. Pinkston----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. who?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Pinkston of the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he come out and get the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; he got it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But Frankie Kaiser pointed it out to you, did he?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you called the FBI and pointed it out to him?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He was down there at the time and I told him about it and\r\nhe and Frankie and I went up and got it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what date?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; that, I sure couldn't tell you. It was the\r\nfollowing week though, I am pretty sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean after the 22d, the following, you say, the 22d of\r\nNovember?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you examine that clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you examine it to see whether or not there was on the\r\nclipboard any orders?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Unfilled orders?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; there were some invoices on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you able to identify those invoices and state to whom\r\nthey had been assigned to fill?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. They were Scott, Foresman invoices.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Scott, Foresman invoices?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir; and he filled mostly Scott, Foresman orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is \"he\"?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oswald filled mostly Scott, Foresman orders?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is Foresman [spelling]?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Foresman [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there any other order filler who filled Scott, Foresman\r\ninvoices?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Any of the other boys would if they ran out of other\r\npublishers' orders. When I get those orders, I sort them according to\r\npublishers and during rush season like that, usually, have one guy\r\nsticking as close to one publisher as he can because skipping back and\r\nforth you have different codes and everything and it is confusing to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So, in the morning would you have assigned all Scott,\r\nForesman to Oswald on that Friday morning?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He already had the orders and was working when I got there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He had?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who would determine what orders they would get?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. When we run out of orders they get to one of the boxes and\r\nget orders for Scott, Foresman. He had been trained for Scott, Foresman.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would orders be assigned the day before?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; we don't definitely assign them to anyone. The\r\nboys know what they can fill best and as long as they are putting the\r\nwork out----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I want to know how a man working on Scott, Foresman--suppose\r\nOswald came to work on Friday morning, tell me what routine he would\r\nfollow, where he would get the orders he was to fill.\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. He would go over to the order desk and get them out of a\r\nbox marked Scott, Foresman.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They would have Scott, Foresman on it?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is he the only one that in the morning when he came to work\r\nwould get the orders out of the box marked Scott, Foresman?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; if there wasn't any orders in any of the other\r\nboxes any other order filler would take them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know whether or not he was filling Scott, Foresman\r\norders that day?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; not for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know whether anybody else was filling Scott, Foresman\r\norders that day?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I am sure they were; that's our biggest publishers;\r\nthere's more of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you believe others besides Oswald were filling Scott,\r\nForesman orders that day?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Probably were.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there any way you can determine what order filler had that\r\nclipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir; it's one that looked like the one he had used.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It did look like the one he had used?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There were how many unfilled orders on that clipboard when it\r\nwas found?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Two or three, best I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you keep a list of them?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody make a list of them?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Not unless Mr. Pinkston did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Pinkston of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes; he called in about the thing and in a little while he\r\nreleased it and said go ahead and fill the orders which we did because\r\nthey were several days old.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean those orders that were on that clipboard had never\r\nbeen filled?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So you went ahead and filled them?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you spell his name--Pinkston?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I don't know how to spell it. Mr. Pinkston is all I know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Pinkston, okay. I think that's all, Mr. Shelley. Thanks very\r\nmuch. This will be written up and you can come down and read it and\r\nsign it or we can waive signature; which would you rather do?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I suppose it doesn't make any difference. What are the\r\nothers doing?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Some waived, some insist on reading it; which would you\r\nrather do?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. I would kind of like to see it for curiosity.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Come down and sign it, all right. Where was the clipboard\r\nfound?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. On the sixth floor in the far corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which corner?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. By the stairway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be the northwest?\r\n\r\nMr. SHELLEY. Northwest, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, fine. Thank you very much, Mr. Shelley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF NAT A. PINKSTON\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Nat A. Pinkston was taken at 12:10 p.m., on April 9,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. State your name, please.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Nat A. Pinkston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I'm a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you had your deposition taken before this proceeding?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your address is what?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. My residence address is 2106 Van Cleave Drive, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how long have you been a Special Agent for the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Be 24 years next month.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are assigned to what office?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you did not receive a letter from the Commission asking\r\nyou to testify, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were asked to come over here by Mr. Shanklin?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At my request, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Well, I----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anyway, you were asked to come over here by Mr. Shanklin and\r\nhe advised you that your deposition would be taken at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The deposition taken in the course of an investigation by\r\nthe Commission to investigate the facts concerning the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the assassination of President Kennedy, and I am a staff\r\nofficer. My name is Joseph A. Ball. I am authorized to administer the\r\noath to you and to ask you certain questions concerning some matters\r\nwhich you do have knowledge of.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are willing to testify, are you not?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In the course of your investigation, were you called to the\r\nTexas School Book Depository sometimes around the 2d of December 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And who asked you to come down there?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I was instructed by one of my supervisors to conduct an\r\ninvestigation there on that date.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On that date?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see a fellow by the name of Frankie Kaiser?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Roy Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they tell you when you came down there?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. To the best of my recollection I was there waiting to see\r\nMr. Truly. He was somewhere else in the building, and I was waiting for\r\nhim on the occasion in question. Frankie Kaiser came down the stairs\r\nand said that he had found something on the sixth floor. I didn't--I\r\nthen accompanied him back to the sixth floor where he pointed out on\r\nthe floor near the entrance to the stair well, a clipboard with some\r\norders on it, and--pardon me a second, do you want me to testify to\r\nwhat Kaiser told me, which is hearsay----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is all right, but Kaiser told you that when you were\r\ndownstairs, that something--didn't he? When he was--did Kaiser come\r\ndownstairs?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes; Kaiser came downstairs and took me back upstairs\r\nwith him and pointed out the clipboard which he had left on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say he had left it there?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. He had seen it there and did not bother it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. He did not put it there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see. Kaiser told you and you went upstairs and Kaiser\r\npointed out the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First, the location of the clipboard.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. The clipboard was generally in the northwest corner of\r\nthe sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. It was on the\r\nfloor behind the books, against the wall of the stair well.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There were some book cartons in front of it, were there?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did Frankie Kaiser say something? That is hearsay, but I\r\nwould like to hear what it was.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. He told me this clipboard was the one that he had made,\r\nand had given to Oswald when Oswald went to work at the School Book\r\nDepository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you examine the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it have anybody's name on it?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. It had quite a bit of scribbling on it, and I\r\nbelieve--well, I am not in a position to say right now exactly what it\r\nhad on it other than some orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It did have some orders on it?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you examine the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me the date of the orders and the general\r\ndescription of the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Three orders on this clipboard. Each order was dated\r\nNovember 22d. The first was an order from Mrs. Hazel Carroll of the\r\nReading Clinic, SMU, for one Parliamentary Procedure at $1.40. Was\r\npublished by Scott, Foresman & Co.\r\n\r\nAnd this invoice bore No. 2454. The second one was an order from Dallas\r\nIndependent School District from Mr. M. J. Morton, purchasing agent, at\r\nthe School Administration Building, 3700 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Tex., for\r\n10 ERS, Basic Reading Skills, for high schools, revised, at $1.12, or\r\ntotal of $11.20. Published by Scott, Foresman & Co.\r\n\r\nThe Invoice was No. 6057.\r\n\r\nThe third order was an order to be sent to Mr. M. K. Baker, Junior High\r\nSchool, Reynosa, New Mex., for one TE Basic Reading Skills. J. H. S.\r\nuse. No charge. Sent at the request of Miss Mary Williams. Publisher;\r\nScott, Foresman & Co., invoice 8291.\r\n\r\nEach of these orders, as I say, were dated November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do when you--with the orders after you made\r\nthese notations?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I turned them over to Mr. Truly. He desired to fill the\r\norders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do with the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I returned the clipboard to my office and made an exhibit\r\nof it, as I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is it still an exhibit? It is an FBI exhibit?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In the possession of the FBI?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I haven't seen it since then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you try to determine if you still have that as an\r\nexhibit in your office, or in Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nNow, this will be written up and will be submitted to you for your\r\nsignature, or you can waive your signature.\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. I would like to----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. See it and read it?\r\n\r\nMr. PINKSTON. See it and read it and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You will be notified to come to this office and read it and\r\nsign it.\r\n\r\n(After the conclusion of the deposition and at 1 o'clock, p.m., on the\r\nsame day as the taking of the deposition, Mr. Nat A. Pinkston appeared\r\nbefore me, Iris Leonard, stating that he wished the following statement\r\nto be incorporated with his deposition: \"After reviewing my records, I\r\nam now able to state definitely that after examining the clipboard and\r\nthe orders thereon, I left them at the Texas School Book Depository\r\nwith Mr. Truly. The clipboard was picked up by another FBI agent at a\r\nlater time and was made an exhibit.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF BILLY NOLAN LOVELADY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Billy Nolan Lovelady was taken at 3:50 p.m., on April\r\n7, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you please stand, hold up your right hand and be sworn?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. State your name, please.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Billy Nolan Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You received a letter from the Commission, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You know the purpose of the investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me something about yourself, where you were born\r\nand what your education was and your experience, in general?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I was born at Myrtle Springs, Tex., 1937, February\r\n19, and lived there for about 20 years until I went into the service\r\nand I did nursery work and that's about all there is, farm work down\r\nthere and nursery and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you go to work for Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. December 16, 1961, I believe it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work did you do there?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, they hired me when I went there as a truck driver,\r\ndrove truck until another job as stockman was open, taking care of the\r\nstock that comes in, see that it's put in the right place.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which one of the buildings do you work in?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. At the one at 411 Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22, 1963, where were you working?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. At that morning, you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I was working on the sixth floor putting--we was putting\r\ndown that flooring.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who were you working with?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, there was Bonnie Ray Williams and Danny Arce and\r\nSlim, Charles Givens; we call him Slim, and let me see, well Mr.\r\nShelley would come up every once in while, check on us. He wasn't\r\nworkin' with us but he would come up see how we gettin' along.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's Mr. Shelley?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Mr. Bill Shelley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his position with Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. He would be under Mr. R. S. Truly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is he a foreman?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I guess you would call it that. He takes care of most\r\nthings down there, paperwork and stuff like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well just to work with him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever talk to him?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I never did carry on any long conversations or\r\nanything like that, maybe, you know, \"Hello,\" or I asked him a few\r\ntimes how his little baby was getting along; he told me it was doing\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did Oswald work in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, he had access to all the building just like I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All floors?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. All floors.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Any floor?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Any floor; I mean he didn't have no business in the\r\noffice. I mean, or to if, say, like Mr. Truly would say \"Okay, Lee, go\r\nup and give me a certain something from the office,\" he could go up\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he work on one floor more than any other?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No; I wouldn't say because there's different publishers\r\non each order and he has to go to different floors to get books.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Oswald ever eat lunch with you?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. He ate two or three times in that little domino room, but\r\nnot by himself, with the rest of the boys.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him come to work that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him carry a sack or anything in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No, sir; just lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he usually carry his lunch or did he buy his lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Most of the time he had fruit and stuff like that, grapes\r\nand raisins, stuff like that I noticed a few times he had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you quit work that day or knock off for lunch\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Same time, 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A little before 12?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, we came down at 10 minutes til to wash up and get\r\nready for it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you come down the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who did you go down with?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Let me see, I think it was Bonnie Ray Williams on the\r\nside I was; I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you having a race with the other boys?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir; sure was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything or hear anything of Oswald on the way\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes; he was on the opposite side of the elevator I was\r\non. I heard him holler to one of the boys to stop, he wanted the\r\nelevator. They said, \"No; we're going down to lunch,\" and closed the\r\ngate I was on and come down and got ready to watch the President come\r\nby or got ready to go to lunch, and that's the last I heard of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were on the west elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oswald was standing in front of the east elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. East, on back, the elevator back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No; I didn't; I just heard his voice because--where those\r\nslats are in back of the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him again that day?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you went down and washed up; what did\r\nyou do?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I went over and got my lunch and went upstairs and\r\ngot a coke and come on back down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Upstairs on what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. That's on the second floor; so, I started going to the\r\ndomino room where I generally went in to set down and eat and nobody\r\nwas there and I happened to look on the outside and Mr. Shelley was\r\nstanding outside with Miss Sarah Stanton, I believe her name is, and I\r\nsaid, \"Well, I'll go out there and talk with them, sit down and eat my\r\nlunch out there, set on the steps,\" so I went out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You ate your lunch on the steps?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was with you?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Bill Shelley and Sarah Stanton, and right behind me----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was that last name?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Stanton.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the first name?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Bill Shelley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Stanton's first name?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Miss Sarah Stanton.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay on the steps?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you there when the President's motorcade went by?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anything?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir; sure did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I thought it was firecrackers or somebody celebrating\r\nthe arrival of the President. It didn't occur to me at first what\r\nhad happened until this Gloria came running up to us and told us the\r\nPresident had been shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was this girl?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Gloria Calvary.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Gloria Calvary?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where does she work?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Southwestern Publishing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was the direction of the sound?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right there around that concrete little deal on that\r\nknoll.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's where it sounded to you?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir; to my right. I was standing as you are going\r\ndown the steps, I was standing on the right, sounded like it was in\r\nthat area.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the underpass area?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Between the underpass and the building right on that\r\nknoll.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have got a picture here, Commission Exhibit 369. Are you on\r\nthat picture?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take a pen or pencil and mark an arrow where you are.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Where I thought the shots are?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; you in the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Oh, here (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Draw an arrow down to that; do it in the dark. You got an\r\narrow in the dark and one in the white pointing toward you. Where were\r\nyou when the picture was taken?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right there at the entrance of the building standing on\r\nthe top of the step, would be here (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were standing on which step?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. It would be your top level.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The top step you were standing there?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, when Gloria came up you were standing near Mr. Shelley?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When Gloria came up and said the President had been shot,\r\nGloria Calvary, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I asked who told her. She said he had been shot so\r\nwe asked her was she for certain or just had she seen the shot hit him\r\nor--she said yes, she had been right close to it to see and she had\r\nsaw the blood and knew he had been hit but didn't know how serious it\r\nwas and so the crowd had started towards the railroad tracks back, you\r\nknow, behind our building there and we run towards that little, old\r\nisland and kind of down there in that little street. We went as far as\r\nthe first tracks and everybody was hollering and crying and policemen\r\nstarted running out that way and we said we better get back into the\r\nbuilding, so we went back into the west entrance on the back dock had\r\nthat low ramp and went into the back dock back inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First of all, let's get you to tell us whom you left the\r\nsteps with.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Mr. Shelley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Shelley and you went down how far?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I would say a good 75, between 75 to 100 yards to\r\nthe first tracks. See how those tracks goes----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went down the dead end on Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And down to the first tracks?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything there?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No sir; well, just people running.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. And hollerin.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to go down there?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I don't know, because everybody was running from that way\r\nand naturally, I guess----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They were running from that way or toward that way?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Toward that way; everybody thought it was coming from\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By the time you left the steps had Mr. Truly entered the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. As we left the steps I would say we were at least 15,\r\nmaybe 25, steps away from the building. I looked back and I saw him and\r\nthe policeman running into the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many steps?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Twenty, 25.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Steps away and you looked back and saw him enter the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you came back. How long did you stay around the railroad\r\ntracks?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Oh, just a minute, maybe minute and a half.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Came back right through that part where Mr. Campbell,\r\nMr. Truly, and Mr. Shelley park their cars and I came back inside the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And enter from the rear?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir; sure did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard the shots. And how long after that was it before\r\nGloria Calvary came up?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Oh, approximately 3 minutes, I would say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Three minutes is a long time.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, it's--I say approximately; I can't say because I\r\ndon't have a watch; it could.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had people started to run?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Well, I couldn't say because she came up to us and we was\r\ntalking to her, wasn't looking that direction at that time, but when we\r\ncame off the steps--see, that entrance, you have a blind side when you\r\ngo down the steps.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right after you talked to Gloria, did you leave the steps and\r\ngo toward the tracks?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you run or walk?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Medium trotting or fast walk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. A fast walk?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to turn around and see Truly and the\r\npoliceman go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Somebody hollered and I looked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You turned around and looked?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After you ran to the railroad tracks you came back and went\r\nin the back door of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go in through the docks, the wide open door or did\r\nyou go in the ordinary small door?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. You know where we park our trucks--that door; we have a\r\nlittle door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is where you went in, that little door?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be the north end of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. That would be the west end, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is it the one right off Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. No; you are thinking about another dock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I am?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes; we have two.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have a dock on the west side and one on the north side\r\nof the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. East, and well, it would be east and west but you enter\r\nit from the south side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, the south side----\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Elm Street is that little dead-end street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's south.\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I drive my truck here (indicating) but we came in from\r\nthis direction; that would have to be west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You came into the building from the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Through that, those raised-up doors.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Through the raised-up doors?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Through that double door that we in the morning when we\r\nget there we raised. There's a fire door and they have two wooden doors\r\nbetween it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You came in through the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who did you see in the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I saw a girl but I wouldn't swear to it it's Vickie.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is Vickie?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. The girl that works for Scott, Foresman.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is her full name?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I wouldn't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Vickie Adams?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I believe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you say it was Vickie you saw?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I couldn't swear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was the girl?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I don't remember what place she was but I remember\r\nseeing a girl and she was talking to Bill or saw Bill or something,\r\nthen I went over and asked one of the guys what time it was and to see\r\nif we should continue working or what.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any other people on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Oh, yes; by that time there were more; a few of the guys\r\nhad come in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you stayed on the first door then?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I would say 30 minutes. And one of the policemen asked me\r\nwould I take them up on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you take them up there?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes, sir; I sure did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mr. Lovelady, your testimony will be written up and it can be\r\nsubmitted to you for your signature if you wish and you can make any\r\nchanges, or you can waive signature and we will make this your final----\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. I want this to be the final one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right; you waive signature?\r\n\r\nMr. LOVELADY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF FRANKIE KAISER\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Frankie Kaiser was taken at 2:30 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A.

What time do you go to work down there?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Eight o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What date did you go to work for them?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was August 24, 1962.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go to school?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Texas--Texarkana, Ark.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you born there?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, sir; I was born in Omaha, Nebr.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then you went to school in Texarkana, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what did you do after you got out of school?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I never finished.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I went to the tenth grade and quit and went in the service\r\nand went in for 6 months in the National Guards and come out and then\r\ncame to Dallas and started to work and I worked for Morrises.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You worked for whom?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Morris Warehouse.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I worked there for about 3 years and then I started to work\r\nover there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You started to work over at the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes--then I got married.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did--what kind of work do you do at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Drive a truck--fill orders--just about anything that needs\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever know a fellow by the name of Lee Oswald that\r\nworked there?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Not personally--I would know him when I would see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you work in the same building with him?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Same building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when the President's parade went by?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. At the Baylor Dental College.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. At the Baylor Dental College.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Sir, you weren't anywhere near the School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, sir; I was off Thursday and Friday with abscessed\r\ntooth. I was sitting in the chair and when I got off, we was out in the\r\nlobby watching it on TV down at the dental college there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you go back to work?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was the following Monday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be the 25th, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir; I believe so--the 25th.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, one day you found a clipboard, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes; it was about a week later. I went upstairs, you see,\r\nthe corner I found it in--we keep a certain teacher's edition of\r\nCatholic handbooks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I didn't quite hear that--Catholic what?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. We keep our teacher's edition of Catholic \"Think and Do\"\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I didn't quite hear that--Catholic what?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. We keep our teacher's edition of Catholic books--separated.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You do?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir; and I went up there to get a teacher's edition.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. On the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what part of the sixth floor is this Catholic edition\r\nlocated?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was in that corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And in what corner is that?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Let's see----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Without saying north or south, was it near the elevator? Or\r\nthe stairway?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, it was right in front of the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was it with reference to the stairway?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was right next to the stairway--right in the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right in the corner next to the stairway, is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what day did you find it, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I couldn't tell you. It was about a week or a week and a\r\nhalf, somewhere in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, this statement you gave to the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation on the 2d of December 1963, says you talked to an agent\r\nnamed Pinkston; do you remember that?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Well, I got my boss and the FBI to go upstairs and I showed\r\nit to them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you saw the clipboard----\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I went downstairs and got my boss.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. William H. Shelley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. This FBI was standing there with me--he was standing there\r\nthen and I told him I had a clipboard laying up there with the orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you think it would have been around December 2?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I couldn't tell you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was within a week after you went back to work, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. To my best knowledge--yes, sir--somewhere in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to find the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I was over there looking for the Catholic\r\nedition--teacher's edition.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you see the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was just laying there in the plain open--and just the\r\nplain open boxes--you see, we've got a pretty good space back there and\r\nI just noticed it laying over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Laying on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, it was laying on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How close was it to the wall?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was about--oh--I would say, just guessing, about 5 or 6\r\ninches, something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the wall and on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Laying on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were there any boxes between the wall and the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, not between the wall and the clipboard--there wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there boxes between the stairway and the clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, you see, here's--let me see just a second--here's the\r\nstairs right here, and we went down this way and here's the stairs this\r\nway going up and here's the--and it was laying right in here by the\r\ncards--there are about four or five cards, I guess, running in front of\r\nit--just laying between the part you go down and the part you go up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean laying between the stairway up and the stairway down?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, right there in the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you examine that clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I didn't touch it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you later touch it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir; they got me to look at it later on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see it had some orders on it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were the orders dated?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were they dated?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I couldn't tell you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Take a look at this statement which you gave to Mr. Pinkston\r\nthat day and read it to yourself and see if it refreshes your memory in\r\nany way?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. (Read statement referred to.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you read that?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does that refresh your memory now as to the orders on the\r\nclipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I didn't know the date on the orders--I knew that there was\r\nsome orders on there--I seen the orders on the clipboard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you examine them to determine the date on them?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Did I examine those orders? No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't examine the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, sir; I just went down and got my boss and then they\r\ntook it down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you make any notes of the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I didn't, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of either the names on the orders or the date of the orders?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, sir; now, my boss may have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all. Did you fill the orders, then, yourself?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, sir; not them, I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You turned these over to your boss?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. You see, I went down and got them and they went down and\r\ngot them and they handled them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all, Mr. Kaiser, and thanks very much for coming up.\r\n\r\nThis will be written up and you can come down and read it over and sign\r\nit if you wish, or you can waive your signature, if you want to, and we\r\ncan send it on without a signature.\r\n\r\nNow, we will mark these pictures we've been talking about here in your\r\ndeposition as Kaiser Exhibits Nos. A, B, C.\r\n\r\n(Marked by reporter as Kaiser Exhibits Nos. A, B, C, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Anything else I can do, let me know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you want to waive your signature to it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, I'll waive it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Fine. That's okay.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF FRANKIE KAISER RESUMED\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Frankie Kaiser was taken at 3:40 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Frankie, we have already taken your deposition and I just\r\nwanted to ask you a few more questions and you are still under oath.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, Frankie, that clipboard you found describe it--what was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was made out of paper and tape and a little piece of\r\npasteboard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who made it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Well, right after I started there--it had been a long time\r\nago.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how was it you weren't using it on this day?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. You see, when he first started there----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is \"he\"?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Lee--when he first started to work there he got my\r\nclipboard and started using it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you give it to him to use?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No, he just picked it up and started using it and I just\r\nwent and made me another one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You recognized that clipboard when you saw it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, because my name was all over it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your name was on it, too?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You put your name \"Frankie Kaiser\" on it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. You see, it don't do no good to get a clipboard around\r\nhere--everybody is always running off with it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's the reason you put your name on it?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. He come up and got it and started using it and I just let\r\nhim keep it and made me another one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, here is a picture which is marked in a group of pictures\r\nas No. 36, but which I will mark as Exhibit A to your deposition.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as Kaiser Exhibit A, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does this show the place where the clipboard was found, or do\r\nyou know?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It wasn't found there--it was found on the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Behind these cartons--between there and the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Behind which cartons?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Right in here (indicating).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which cartons--it was found behind--are the cartons in the\r\npicture--it wasn't found where it is circled there?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It wasn't found where it circled--there--it was found on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Put a big \"X\" on the carton behind which it was found.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I'll put it on this one--it was found between that and the\r\nwall. (Witness placed \"X\" on the pictures requested by Counsel Ball.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have marked an \"X\" on the carton--between that carton and\r\nthe wall the clipboard was found.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, between these row of cartons right over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you later find clothing?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. I just found the coat there--I didn't even know it was his\r\nuntil somebody told me it was. I thought they were kidding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Commission Exhibit 163--do you recognize that blue\r\njacket?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. That's the one I found.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you find it--tell me first.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. It was in the window sill.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In what room?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. In the domino room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, I show you a picture, No. 17, this is marked--does this\r\nshow the window?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Right down in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is a jacket showing in that window, is that where the\r\njacket was found?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes, sir; but it was laying behind this in the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It wasn't found in the position of the jacket shown in the\r\npicture?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. No; it sure wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But was it the same window?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the window sill is shown there too?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes; it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I show you a picture which is marked Exhibit 18, does this\r\nshow the place where the jacket was found?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Right over in here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where--put an \"X\" there--it's in the window sill?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Right.\r\n\r\n(Marked diagram with an \"X\".)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is an Exhibit 17, which shows the corner of the domino\r\nroom and the window and it is marked as Exhibit B and the picture\r\nmarked No. 18, which shows the window sill, bearing an \"X\" placed there\r\nby the witness, and is marked as Exhibit \"C\". Will you initial that \"C\"\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. (Initialed instrument as requested.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's \"FK\".\r\n\r\nI believe we are through, now, Frankie, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. That's all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You'll waive this signature too?\r\n\r\nMr. KAISER. Yes.\r\n\r\n(Instruments marked by the reporter as Kaiser Exhibits B and C, for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF CHARLES DOUGLAS GIVENS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Charles Douglas Givens was taken at 9 a.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you stand and raise your right hand? Do you solemnly\r\nswear that the testimony you are about to give, will be the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN.

No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you born, Mr. Givens?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Kemp, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you lived in Texas most of your life?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. All my life except I was in the Armed Forces during World\r\nWar II, in the Navy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long were you in the Navy?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. About 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me backtrack a little. Did you go to high school before\r\nyou went in the Navy?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you get through school?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Twelfth grade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you get through the 12th?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got up to the 12th grade?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I went to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Doing what?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. SMU.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. SMU.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. SMU?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do out there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I worked in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Oh, about 2 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I went in the service.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went in the service for a couple of years?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do with most of your time in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I was in the Steward Mate Branch.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you honorably discharged?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do when you got out of the service?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I went back to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At SMU?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I worked at Central Lumber Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Doing what there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I was a truck helper; helper on the truck.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were helper on a truck?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Delivering lumber; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Oh, about a year and a half, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. One time I got into a little difficulty. Got in a little\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got in a little trouble?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you were not working for a while?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how long was that?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. About 13 months.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I came back and I worked for a construction company,\r\nand then after that I got this job down here at the depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At the School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long have you worked there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Off and on about 6 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there any period of time that you haven't worked there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What happened then?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I just, you know, sometimes I had some days to layoff\r\nduring the slack season, like it is now, and when it is rush season he\r\ncalls you back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So it was just a question of being laid off during the slack\r\nseason?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you do down there at the Texas Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I filled orders and stacked books, and you know,\r\ndon't have any special job.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On what floors do you generally work most of all?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I work on the first floor most of the time, like we\r\nfill orders. We work out of the stock downstairs. We go upstairs. We\r\nhave stock on three floors, fifth, sixth, and seventh.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, do you fill orders for any particular publisher more\r\nthan another, so that you might be on the fifth floor, or the sixth\r\nfloor more than the seventh, or do you just spend as much time on any\r\none of those top floors as you do on any other top floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what you were doing on the 22d of November 1963,\r\nalso?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What were you doing on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. We were fixing the floor, putting down some plywood on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What floor would this have been on?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Sixth.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What part of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. We were working on the west end.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, do you remember what time you got to work that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; I got to work around about a quarter to eight.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go when you got to work?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I went in a little lunchroom that we have downstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what you call the domino room?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You carry your lunch with you?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You put your lunch there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you wear a jacket to work that day?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I wore a raincoat, I believe. It was misting that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hang up your coat in that room, too?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you know Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I knew of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you ever talked with him at all?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I talked to him once in a while. I mean, just like\r\nabout filling orders or something like that. Sometimes I check and he\r\nwas filling orders and he make a mistake, and I call him and get the\r\nbook right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember any conversation you ever had with him? What\r\nyou said and what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, he was a fellow that kept pretty much to himself. He\r\nnever had too much to say.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever say anything to you, what a nice day, or about\r\nhis family, or baseball, or anything?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Ever talk to you about any politics?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you talked to him about correcting an order, what did\r\nyou say and what did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I just tell him he had the wrong book.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What would he say?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. He said, \"Okay,\" and got the record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you call him, Lee or Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Called him Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did he call you?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, he never called me anything. I never heard him call\r\nme anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he make mistakes often?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, not too often.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got to work on the morning of November 22, did you\r\nsee him at all there or not?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. 22d? That was on Friday, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Friday; that is the day the President came by.\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, I saw him that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see him first?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I first saw him on the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time was that?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, about 8:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, let me ask you this. You got to work at a quarter to 8?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do between a quarter of 8 and 8:30? Where were\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I went upstairs. We went to work at 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him come into the domino room at all?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Not that morning, no, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you leave the domino room to go up to the sixth\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At 8 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you don't feel he came in the domino room before 8\r\no'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; not that morning he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How did you get up to the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. On the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The east or the west one? The west one is the one that would\r\nbe nearest the railroad tracks, and the east one would be nearer the\r\nHouston Street.\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. We went up on the east one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any particular reason why you took the east one rather than\r\nthe west one?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I don't know whether you call it a particular reason,\r\nbut on the west, you have double gates on that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the west elevator on the first floor when you took the\r\neast elevator up?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. It was that morning, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was that morning around 8 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, where did you see him at 8:30 o'clock first?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I came back down to use the rest room.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. He was over there in the bin filling orders.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was over in the bin filling orders?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; they had some bins there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk to him at all?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you say hello, Lee?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I didn't say anything to him. I just looked at him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what he was wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I believe it was kind of a greenish looking shirt and\r\npants was about the same color as his shirt, practically the same thing\r\nhe wore all the time he worked there. He never changed clothes the\r\nwhole time he worked there, and he would wear a grey looking jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. You saw him at 8:30 on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, we went back upstairs and started to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went back up to the sixth floor to continue laying the\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you see Lee Harvey Oswald next?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Next?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, it was about a quarter till 12, we were on our way\r\ndownstairs, and we passed him, and he was standing at the gate on the\r\nfifth floor.\r\n\r\nI came downstairs, and I discovered I left my cigarettes in my jacket\r\npocket upstairs, and I took the elevator back upstairs to get my jacket\r\nwith my cigarettes in it. When I got back upstairs, he was on the sixth\r\nfloor in that vicinity, coming from that way.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Coming from what way?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Toward the window up front where the shots were fired from.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Just a second, where did you go? Where were you when you saw\r\nhim on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I had went and got my jacket and was on my way back to the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, just a second. I am going to get a plan of the\r\nsixth floor, if I have one, and try and have you point that out to me.\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, I don't seem to have a sixth floor plan here, but\r\nperhaps we can use another plan here to help us.\r\n\r\nHere is a diagram of the front of the building. This is the Elm Street\r\nside, and you can see the arrow pointing north.\r\n\r\nThis perhaps would be a diagram of the third floor. You notice that\r\nthere are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven sets of windows,\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On the Elm Street side, seven pairs of windows?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You notice the two freight elevators toward the rear. Now\r\ndid you see--when you first saw him on the sixth floor there, were you\r\nstanding near any of these windows?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir. I was over here by the elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are pointing your finger to a spot which would be\r\nsomewhat to the east of the east elevator, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At a spot which is about on the same line as what I call the\r\nsouth side of the east elevator, and about as far east of the front\r\npart of that elevator as the distance from the front of the elevator to\r\nthe back of the east elevator, is that about right?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were standing at that point, and where did you see Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I was along here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you are pointing at a spot you say along in here?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be near the east wall of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can see a scale here that is from 0 to 20 feet. Well, it\r\nwould be about 30 to 40 feet north of the south wall of that building,\r\nis that right?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And around 10 feet or so away from the east wall, is that\r\nabout right?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That is about right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, did you notice whether or not there were any cartons\r\nstacked up around the southeast corner of that sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I didn't pay any attention about any being stacked,\r\nbecause we had taken all that stock from that side of the building and\r\nran it down that side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had taken stock down from the west part of the sixth\r\nfloor where you were working and put it there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; ran it down the side right in front of the window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he between that stock and the window, or was he on the\r\nother side of the window?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. He was between the stock and the window, coming towards the\r\nelevators.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Coming towards the elevators?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see all of his body or not?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; he had his clipboard in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He had his clipboard in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that kind of an aisleway over there right next to the\r\neast wall that he was walking along, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; they have aisles.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, was there stock in back of him as well as in front\r\nof him? Were you where you had stacked it up, or not, or don't you\r\nremember?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, it was already some books stacked there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were there books stacked between where you saw him and the\r\nwindow itself?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, he was walking with his clipboard from that\r\nsoutheast corner?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see him walking? What direction did you see\r\nhim walking in?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. He was coming towards the elevators.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the Elm Street side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So that would be walking in a northerly direction?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you said that he had a clipboard in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; he had his board with his orders on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the orders on the board?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, yes, sir; he had it in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he have any books in his hand that he was carrying?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever fill orders in November on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether or not there were any books or book\r\ncartons over in that corner from which he might have been filling\r\norders?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, yes, sir; it was possible.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was possible?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you watch where he walked to?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, no, sir; I didn't pay much attention. I was\r\ngetting ready to get on the elevator, and I say, \"Boy, are you going\r\ndownstairs?\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did he say to you?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I say, \"It's near lunch time.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"No, sir. When you get downstairs, close the gate to the\r\nelevator.\"\r\n\r\nThat meant the elevator on the west side, you can pull both gates down\r\nand it will come up by itself.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What else did he say?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you say to that? Did you say you would close the\r\nelevator gate, or not say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I said, \"Okay,\" and got on the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What elevator did you take down?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I taken this one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The east elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. The east elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not when you got down to the first\r\nfloor, the west elevator was there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; it wasn't, because I looked over there to close\r\nthe gate and it wasn't there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It wasn't there when you got down to the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; it wasn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know where it was?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What time was this?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I would say it was about 5 minutes to 12, then\r\nbecause it was----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what did you do when you got down there on the first\r\nfloor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. When I got down to the first floor Harold Norman, James\r\nJarman and myself, we stood over by the window, and then we said we was\r\ngoing outside and watch the parade, so we walked out and we stood there\r\na while, and then I said, \"I believe I will walk up to the parking lot.\"\r\n\r\nI had a friend that worked on the parking lot, right on Elm and Record.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Elm and Record Streets?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Elm and Record Streets; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be one block to the east of the corner of Elm and\r\nHouston?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then, what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I stood around over there and went up on the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What corner?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Up on Main and Record. That is where I watched the\r\nPresident pass right there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who else was there with you that you knew?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. James and Edward Shields.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that the same person, James Edward?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Edward Shields and James.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Two other people?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You watched the motorcade together?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do after you watched the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. We turned and started back down to the parking lot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Then when we heard the shots, by the time we got along in\r\nfront, right across in front of the Record Building, then we heard the\r\nshots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I want to backtrack a minute before we come to the shots.\r\nWhen did you eat lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. When did I eat lunch? I ate lunch after. Let's see, no; I\r\nate lunch before I went up there, because I stood outside and ate my\r\nsandwich standing out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You ate your lunch outside?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir. Standing in front of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In front of what building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Texas School Book.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever eat any lunch inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; I eat inside the building all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On November 22, did you eat inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you said you saw Lee Oswald on the sixth floor around\r\n11:55?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see Lee Oswald anywhere else in the building between\r\n11:55 and the time you left the building?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him in the domino room at all around anywhere\r\nbetween 11:30 and 12 or 12:30?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him reading the newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No; not that day. I did--he generally sit in there every\r\nmorning. He would come to work and sit in there and read the paper, the\r\nnext day paper, like if the day was Tuesday, he would read Monday's\r\npaper in the morning when he would come to work, but he didn't that\r\nmorning because he didn't go in the domino room that morning. I didn't\r\nsee him in the domino room that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How do you know it was the previous day paper that he read?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Because he would be sitting there and I would look at him,\r\nwhen he got through and got up to go to work, I would get it and look\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it be a News or Times Herald?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, they bring Dallas Morning News around in the morning.\r\nFellows bring it to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean he would read someone else's newspaper that\r\nsomebody else brought to work?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever know him to buy his own newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I never saw him buy one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who generally brought the newspaper there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, Harold Norman would generally bring one and James\r\nJarman would generally bring one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you say you left the sixth floor. Well, you said you\r\nleft it first to go--did you go down with the other employees on the\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time was that now?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That was about a quarter--I said about a quarter to 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was on that elevator, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That was Bonnie Ray Williams, and Billy Lovelady, and Danny\r\nand myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That was Danny Arce?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; a Spanish boy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you say you got down there and you say you wanted your\r\ncigarettes so you went back up?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What elevator did you go down on?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I came down on the east elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What elevator did you take back up?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. The east elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That day had you eaten any chicken at all, or anything on\r\nthe sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you eaten any chicken or left a pop bottle on any\r\nprevious days on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go immediately to your jacket when you went back up\r\nto the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; I went straight and picked up my jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was your jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. It was on the west side of the building where we were\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, there are seven pairs of windows. Was it on the south\r\nwall of the building? Was it near any one of those windows on the south\r\nwall, or was it more to the center of the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. It was more to the corner on the west side. I would say\r\nalong about the second window going.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say the corner, do you mean the corner by the\r\nstairs or the southwest corner?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Southwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have shown the southwest corner?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir; along about here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have pointed to a spot which appears to be\r\napproximately, oh, 25 feet north, and about 10 feet east of the\r\nsouthwest corner of the sixth floor. Would that be about right?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have pointed to a spot on this floor plan here. When you\r\nwalked from the east elevator to pick up your jacket, did you see Lee\r\nOswald there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him anywhere on the sixth floor when you were\r\nwalking off the elevator to pick up your jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I didn't see him until I got back along here,\r\nabout in front of the elevator, fixing to get on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you were walking to the first spot, which we will\r\ndescribe as somewhat east of the east elevator, were you standing or\r\nabout to get on the elevator, or what?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; I was fixing to get on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were fixing to get on? The elevator was still there\r\nwhere you left it when you came up?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you were starting to get on the elevator or were turning\r\nto get on it, you saw Lee Oswald walking with his clipboard?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, was he walking in a diagonal direction directly toward\r\nyou and the elevator, or was he walking more in a direction parallel to\r\nthe east wall here?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I would say yes, sir; he was going like this.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was going?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Coming down the aisle.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Coming down the aisle straight?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else in his hand other than a clipboard? Did he\r\nhave a pencil in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got off the elevator, as you were coming back up to\r\nget your shirt, did you have any occasion as you were walking out of\r\nthe elevator to look to see if there was anyone else on the floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, no, sir; I wasn't thinking of that. I just happened\r\nto glance around as I was on my way back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you glance around when you got off the elevator, do you\r\nremember?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, no, sir. I just walked off and turned and went right\r\nover there and picked my jacket up and started back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look over in the southeast corner before as you were\r\ngetting off the elevator?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I kind of glanced that way when I turned to go around\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone over there at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Not at that time, no, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember how high the books were by the southeast\r\ncorner on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I would say about 10 feet from the window. In the\r\naisle we had one pretty good stack of books there, one large stack.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would they have been as tall as you?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If a man would have been standing up there, would you have\r\nbeen able to see him?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; I wouldn't unless he moved down towards the north\r\nend of the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did anyone else use any of the elevators while you were up\r\non the sixth floor getting your cigarettes?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Not that I know of; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever tell anyone that you saw Lee Oswald reading a\r\nnewspaper in the domino room around 11:50, 10 minutes to 12 on that\r\nmorning on November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever observe Lee Oswald getting the newspaper in the\r\ndomino room shortly before lunch on days other than November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Not before lunch. It would be right at lunch time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Right at lunch time?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir. We always ate in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would Oswald always eat in there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you first went downstairs from the sixth floor to the\r\nfirst floor with the other men on those two elevators, you took two\r\nelevators, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; we took two down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you racing the elevators?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who won?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, the east elevator beat the other one down, because it\r\nstopped quicker, but it had to adjust itself.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got down to the first floor before\r\nyou went back up to the sixth floor again?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, I got a drink of water and reached for my cigarettes\r\nand I thought about I left them in my jacket pocket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to the rest room at all before you went back up\r\nto the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir. Yes, sir, I believe I did. I went in and washed my\r\nhands, I sure did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else before you went back up to the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; that was it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now the first time when you left the sixth floor with these\r\nother men to take the two elevators down, did you at any time look over\r\nto the southeast corner of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, no, sir; I didn't pay any attention the first time I\r\nwas coming down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you laying the new floor that morning? What\r\nportion of the sixth floor would it be?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. West side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How much of the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, we were working, I would say, about 10 feet from Elm\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, you were pointing to right over this point here?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, looking at the scale, it would be about 10 feet from\r\nthe--it would be more than 10 feet. Here is the scale.\r\n\r\nThis would be 20 feet, so it would be more than 20 feet from Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. About 20 feet, maybe so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you think it was closer to 10 feet than 20 feet from the\r\nElm Street side of the west part of the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I believe it was somewhere in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How close was it to the west wall on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, we were, oh, I would say about 20 feet out from the\r\nwall, we had laid.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did anyone else ever comment to you as having seen Oswald on\r\nthe sixth floor that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, is there anything else you can think of that\r\nhappened that morning up to the time you heard the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir. Everything was all right until that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you heard them?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, we broke and ran down that way, and by the time we\r\ngot to the corner down there of Houston and Elm, everybody was running,\r\ngoing toward the underpass over there by the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd we asked--I asked someone--some white fellow there, \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Somebody shot the President.\" Like that. So I stood there\r\nfor a while, and I went over to try to get to the building after they\r\nfound out the shots came from there, and when I went over to try to get\r\nback in the officer at the door would't let me in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you tell him you worked there?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes; but he still wouldn't let me in. He told me he\r\nwouldn't let no one in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This was the front of Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes. So I goes back over to the parking lot and I wait\r\nuntil I seen Junior.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that Jarman?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes. They were on their way home, and they told me that\r\nthey let them all go home for the evening, and I said, \"I'd better go\r\nback and get my hat and coat.\"\r\n\r\nSo I started over there to pick up my hat and coat, and Officer Dawson\r\nsaw me and he called me and asked me was my name Charles Givens, and I\r\nsaid, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"We want you to go downtown and make a statement.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he puts me in the car and takes me down to the city hall and I made\r\na statement to Will Fritz down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see Lee Oswald at any time after the time you\r\nsaw him carrying the clipboard on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir. The next time I saw him was on television.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else you can think of, whether I have\r\nasked it or not, that in any way is relevant to the assassination?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of about Lee Oswald, whether I\r\nhave asked it or not, that might in any way be helpful?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir. Other than he is just a peculiar fellow. He is\r\njust a loner. Don't have much to say to anybody. Stayed by himself most\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever notice any one person there he was more\r\nfriendly with than the other?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Well, this boy he rode with.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Frazier?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir. Every once in a while I would see him talking to\r\nhim. Bonnie Ray told me--I never saw him, but Bonnie Ray told me he\r\ntalked to he and Danny sometimes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Not that I know of; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir; that is about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, Mr. Givens, we surely appreciate your cooperation in\r\ncoming down here.\r\n\r\nNow you and I didn't talk about this at all until we started taking\r\nthis deposition, did we?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You walked into the room and you raised your right hand and\r\nwe started taking your testimony. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have I ever met you before?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. I don't believe so. I don't believe I have.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have an opportunity to come back here and read this and\r\nsign it if you want, or else you can just waive signing and have the\r\ncourt reporter send it directly to Washington. Do you want to come back\r\nand read and sign it or do you want to just have the court reporter\r\njust send it to Washington?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Would it be necessary to come back?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No, sir; it is not. You can waive it if you desire to do it.\r\nDo you want to waive it?\r\n\r\nMr. GIVENS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, thank you. We will see you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF TROY EUGENE WEST\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Troy Eugene West was taken at 10:30 a.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. West, would you raise your right hand, please.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You want to sit down now, please. Will you please state your\r\nname for the record? Your name is Troy Eugene West?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Troy Eugene West.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old are you, Mr. West?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I was born in 1907. That would be 57, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you born in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You go to school at all in Texas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you get through school?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I went to the seventh grade.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well; I had to come out of school and go to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You started working then?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you started working? Where did you work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. On the farm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On the farm?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. On the farm, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay on the farm?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Oh, I stayed on the farm until way up after I got grown. I\r\nwas way up past--I guess I was about 24.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you left the the farm, then what did you do when you\r\nleft the farm?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I came to town after I left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; little town at Mexia, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay in town there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I lived there for about 7 years, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were in town for 7 years, and generally what did you do\r\nwhen you were in town?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I worked the express all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. For any particular company?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I was trying to think of the man's name.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You can't remember it right now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I just can't remember it right now. Been quite a little while.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, do you remember what you did after you got through\r\ndoing that? After 6 or 7 years, then where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I came to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do in Dallas, generally?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I worked around just different places until I started\r\nto work for the company where I am now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you start working for them?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I have been with them now about 16 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been with them 16 or 17 years? What company is that?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you still working for them now?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you do for the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I am a mail wrapper.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are a mail wrapper?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I wrap mail all the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you doing that on November 22d of 1963, too? Were you a\r\nmail wrapper at that time back in last November?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to work on November 22, 1963? That was a Friday,\r\nthe day the President was assassinated.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes; I went to work that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What time did you get to work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, we always got to work--we were supposed to be there at\r\n8 in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got there at 8 that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes. I always, most of the time I got there a little early.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what time you got to work that particular\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. It was about 10 minutes to 8. I always be 5 or 10 minutes\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go when you got to work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, when I first got to work I always made coffee in the\r\nmorning at the store. That is the first thing I do in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you make the coffee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you make coffee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, it is down on the first floor in the same department\r\nwhere I wrap mail at.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, I have a first floor map here of the School Book\r\nDepository. Here is Elm Street and here is the front entrance.\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. Truly's office, and here is Mr. Shelley's office.\r\n\r\nThere is the stairway down to the basement, and there are the elevators\r\nand the back stairway. There are the toilets there. About where would\r\nyou wrap mail there? Here is the domino room and the shower.\r\n\r\nYou are looking here, that is north Elm Street runs this way and\r\nHouston Street runs that way. It is shown on that diagram.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, my place was in the west side of the other building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it near the stairway.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No; it wasn't close to the stairway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it closer to the Elm Street side of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was it close to? The west side is the side near the\r\nrailroad tracks and the triple underpass. Is that what you think is the\r\nwest side?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; that is what I would call the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, now, the northwest part is by the stairway, and the\r\nsouthwest part would be toward the corner near Elm Street. Do you mean\r\ntoward the Elm or more toward the wooden dock in the back?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, it was about, I would say, middleways between Elm and\r\nthe dock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, there are a couple of overhead doors on that west\r\nside, aren't there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You see where it is marked on the first floor diagram,\r\noverhead door and overhead door? Two doorways here on the west side?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then was it near either one of those doorways?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, it was near this one, pretty close to this one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was close to what I would call a doorway, approximately\r\nin the middle side of the west wall of the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is where you wrapped the mail?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is where you have the coffee machine?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; I have it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is where you went when you got to work that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you first go to the domino room and leave your lunch or\r\nhang up your coat or anything?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir. I just always go right there first. Sometime I pull\r\nmy coat off and lay it over on the table and go right on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long did you stay about making coffee when you got\r\nthere? How long did you stay around that place when you first got there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, let's see, it didn't take me too long. I mean, you\r\nknow, to make the coffee. After I got it made, I went right on and went\r\nright on at my work wrapping mail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you stay in that general area all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you stay in that general location all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. That was my, all my work was right there on the first floor.\r\nI never did---\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see Lee Harvey Oswald that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes; I had been seeing him every morning, you know. He would\r\ncome to work. Excepting the morning, I didn't see him that morning at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you generally see him when he first came to work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Most of the time I see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see him when he first came to work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, he would come in and probably I would be on my way back\r\nto the rest room, probably to get water in my percolator, or maybe wash\r\nthe cups or something, and I would see him when he would come in, and I\r\nwould speak and go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you say, and what did Lee Harvey Oswald say?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I would just say to him, \"Good morning,\" and he said, \"Good\r\nmorning,\" to me, and he was going right on, and I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever stop and get a cup of coffee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I never did see him stop and get any. I don't know whether he\r\ndrink coffee or not. He never did stop and get any.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you would see him, where would he be walking or working\r\nwhen he first came to work in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. He would be order filler, and naturally, they have bins, all\r\nthose bins down there made for stock, and he would be working around in\r\nthere sometime.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him when you walked into work, or did you see\r\nhim after he started working?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I would notice him times after he done started working.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You didn't generally see him walking into work, did you, or\r\ndid you?\r\n\r\nGenerally, when you would first see him, would he be just walking into\r\nwork?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Be just coming in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What route would he take when he normally came to work? Do\r\nyou know what doorway? Did he walk through the front or the back?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, it is through the back door. He would come in the side\r\ndoor next to the dock on the northeast side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what route would he take when he walked in?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, he would come right in, and a lot of times I would be\r\nmostly, or be passing him, and he would come right in and probably I'd\r\ngo right on, and I never would see him no more than that he would be on\r\nthat work, or whatever.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When he came in, for instance, did he go right to an\r\nelevator to go upstairs, or did he go over to the domino room, or down\r\nto the basement, or where would he go when he would first come in?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. He would go and pull off his jacket or coat or whatever he\r\nhad on, and go on to work there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, where would he put his coat when he took it off?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Sometimes he would hang it up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Pretty close to the elevator, or something, or lots of times\r\nhe would just lay it down on something there in the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him take his jacket into the domino room to\r\nhang it up?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No; I never did see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He would either lay his jacket or hang it up by the\r\nelevator, or lay it on these boxes where he was working, is that what\r\nyour testimony is?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; he would lay it either close, hang it up on the\r\nelevator, or either lay it down.\r\n\r\nA lot of times, he would just pull it off and lay it down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would he ever take his shirt off and put it down there and\r\njust work in a T-shirt?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I don't believe I ever seen him working in just a T-shirt.\r\nHe worked in his shirt all right, but I never did see him work in a\r\nT-shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him carrying his lunch inside?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I never did see him with any lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On the morning of November 22, did you happen to see Buell\r\nWesley Frazier? Do you remember Frazier who worked down there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you happen to see him come in that morning on November\r\n22, that Friday, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, lots of times I seen him that day, but now I didn't see\r\nhim when he came in, because I had got busy at working and I might have\r\nprobably had been in, you know, a good while before I saw him. I didn't\r\nsee when he came.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, I believe you earlier testified you never saw Oswald on\r\nNovember 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I didn't see him that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you generally at your spot in the west part of the\r\nfirst floor there that you are talking about by the mailing place?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were there many days when you would ever see him working\r\ndown there in the morning near you?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir. I had generally been seeing him nearly every\r\nmorning, excepting that morning I didn't see him at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw him every morning except that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Practically every morning except then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you quit for lunch that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, we always quit at 12 o'clock in the day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that when you quit on November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I went in and washed my hands and face and then got\r\nready to put my coffee on. I always make coffee at 12. Make it in the\r\nmorning, and then I make it about 12, between 12 and 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do? Did you put your coffee on?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the west part of the first floor where you generally work?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I went to get my lunch to eat a bite.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you get your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I always kept my lunch right there close by my machine,\r\nby my wrapping machine that I use all the time, that I always kept my\r\nlunch. I have a little place underneath and I keep it there all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you the only one that wraps the books for mailing, or\r\nwraps them up for mailing?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, no, sir; I am not the only one, but mine is that way\r\njust every day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You do it all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes; I do that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you the only one that does it all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I am the only one that is steady, wraps mail all the time,\r\nalthough I have help, you know, when it gets stacked.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Lee Harvey Oswald ever help you wrap mail?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No sir; he never did.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not he ever borrowed or used any\r\nwrapping paper for himself?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't know?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him around these wrapper rolls or wrapper\r\nroll machines, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I never noticed him being around.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are they paper machines with the rolls of wrapping paper?\r\nYou have some gum there too, for taping it? When you wrap it, would you\r\ntape it with some tape?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I never noticed him being around.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you do that? Did you put tape on the wrapping paper when\r\nit was being shipped?\r\n\r\nWhen you wrap the books up with wrapping paper, did you have any gum\r\ntape that you put on it?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I had a machine that I placed it on the machine and\r\ntied it with, and the machine tied it with a string.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. With string?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Didn't you have any gummed tape by your machine?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Sir?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you have any kind of a tape, sticky tape that you would\r\nput on the paper to keep it together, or was that somewhere else?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Oh, yes, sir; I used some of that wide tape.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that sticky tape?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To seal the package with?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; that's right.\r\n\r\nAnd then I tie it, put it on the machine and then tie it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is yours the only place that they have the sticky tape?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, that is the only place that is supposed to be, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could other employees come and pick up some of the tape for\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; they could come get it if they wanted to use it,\r\nbut all the time it was there where it is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did other employees from time to time come and borrow some\r\nof that tape at all, or use it?\r\n\r\nWould other employees ever use any of that tape for themselves?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Not as I know of now.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If I wanted to use any of that tape, you know that tape that\r\nyou use to seal it, is there a way to make tape wet so I don't have to\r\nlick it myself with my tongue to make it wet and sticky? Or how did you\r\nget it to be sticky and stick together?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, we have those machines with the little round ball that\r\nwe fill them up with water, and so we set them up. In to--other words,\r\nI got a rack that we set them in, and so we put out tape in a machine,\r\nand whenever we pull the tape through, why then the water gets, you\r\nknow, it gets water on it as we pull it through.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If I wanted to pull the tape, pull off a piece without\r\ngetting water on it, would I just lift it up without going over the wet\r\nroller and get the tape without getting it wet?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. You would have to take it out. You would have to take it out\r\nof the machine. See, it's put on there and then run through a little\r\nclamp that holds it down, and you pull it, well, then the water, it\r\ngets water on it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is this an electrical machine or is it just kind of a little\r\napparatus for just pulling it through by hand?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, it is not electric, no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now going back to November 22, you said you quit for lunch\r\naround noon on that day on Friday, November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes. About 12 o'clock we always quit for lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember any of the men coming down the elevator that\r\nday? Bonnie Ray Williams or James Jarman, Jr., or Danny Arce, or any\r\none else coming down that morning? Charlie Givens?\r\n\r\nDo you remember them coming down the elevator, or don't you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, after you quit for lunch, you made the coffee then?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you make the coffee?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I made the coffee right there close to the wrapping mail\r\ntable where I wrap mail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I sit down to eat my lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I had just, after I made coffee, I just had started to\r\neat my lunch because I was a little hungry--I didn't eat anything that\r\nmorning before I went to work--and I had started to eat my lunch.\r\n\r\nBut before I got through, well, all of this was, I mean, the police and\r\nthings was coming in, and I was just spellbound. I just didn't know\r\nwhat was the matter. So I didn't get through eating. I had to eat about\r\nhalf my lunch, and that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear any shots fired?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I didn't hear a one. Didn't hear a one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone else on the first floor while you were\r\neating your lunch? Anyone else at all did you see on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. It wasn't anybody. I didn't see anybody around at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At any time while you were making coffee or eating your\r\nlunch, did you see anyone else on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I didn't see.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was the first person you saw on the first floor after\r\nyou--while you were eating your lunch? Someone came in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes; before I got through. The officers and things were\r\ncoming in the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was the first person or persons that you saw coming\r\nthrough there while you were eating your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, that was police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A police officer?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone else?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I guess it was a bunch of them, I guess, FBI men, and just a\r\ncrowd of them coming in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see Roy Truly coming in at all that time? Do you\r\nknow Mr. Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; that is the boss, the superintendent.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him, do you remember, while you were eating\r\nyour lunch, come in the building?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Yes, sir; I think he came in with the police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he one of the first people in, or did other people come\r\nin ahead of him, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Really, I just don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is okay if you don't remember. That is all I want you\r\nto say if you don't remember.\r\n\r\nDid you hear anyone yelling to let the elevator loose or anything like\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. I can't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you working when you were eating your lunch? Were you\r\nfacing the elevator or not when you were eating your lunch? Were you\r\nfacing any of the elevators back there?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I was always--I mean I would always be with my back\r\nkind of, you know, towards the elevators and facing the front side over\r\non the side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The Elm Street side?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Toward Elm Street side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you don't know whether anyone was using the elevators?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether anyone was going up and down the stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know anything else about what happened on November\r\n22, that might be helpful or relevant here?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I don't really.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you ever on the second floor on November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I never did hardly ever leave the first floor. That\r\nis just I stayed there where all my work was, and I just stayed there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On November 22, did you ever leave the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. No, sir; I never did leave the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that you can think of, whether I have asked it\r\nor not?\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I don't know anything else. I know of nothing else.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we thank you very much for coming down here, Mr. West.\r\nIf you want, you can come back down again and read your deposition and\r\nsign it, or else you can just waive coming down here. You don't have to\r\ncome down. You can tell the court reporter to send it directly to us,\r\nif you want to.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. You mean when I get ready to sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you do not have to sign it if you don't want to. You can\r\njust tell the court reporter to type it up and send it directly to us,\r\nor you can tell the court reporter you would like to read it and sign\r\nit before she sends it to us in Washington.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to sign it. Or if you want to sign it, you can come back\r\nand sign it, whichever you want to do.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I think--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you want to come down here again and read it and sign it,\r\nor do you want to waive?\r\n\r\nYou can waive and tell the court reporter that she can just send it\r\nafter she types it up, directly to us in Washington without your\r\nreading it and signing it.\r\n\r\nMr. WEST. Well, I think that is what I will do, just have it waived and\r\nsend it on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, that is fine.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DANNY G. ARCE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Danny G.

Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were\r\nborn and where you went to school?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I was born here in Dallas and I went to Stephen F. Foster\r\nElementary school and Alex W. Spence Junior High and Crozier Tech.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, I quit school and found a job and worked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you find a job?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. The first job, well, you don't want----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; just in general.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Oh, I worked as a cook, short order cook and busboy, and\r\njust odd jobs at this Rubenstein place on Hall--Rubenstein and Sons. I\r\nhaven't had too many jobs.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is Rubenstein and Son, a restaurant?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No; kind of an oyster place; they pack them and send them\r\nout, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What else have you done?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. That's about all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you go to work for the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I started in September--September, I believe, the 6th,\r\nSeptember 6th.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of what year?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You received a letter from the Commission asking you to\r\nappear here, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You understand the purpose of the investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To determine the facts surrounding the assassination of the\r\nPresident, President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You started to work in September 1963, this last September?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes; last September.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work were you employed to do?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Order filler.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What building did you work in?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. At the warehouse.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At Houston and Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No; that's on----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which is this?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. That's the one behind it; directly behind the Texas School\r\nBook Depository at Elm and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You worked there most of the time as an order filler?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever work over at the building at 411 Elm?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir; they were short of help up there and they sent me\r\nand the other boy down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is the other boy?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Bonnie Ray Williams.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They sent you out to do what?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Help lay out a floor on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What date did they send you down there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Sir, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. October?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I know I had been there about 4 weeks when all that happened;\r\nI believe 4 or 5 weeks. I am not too sure about that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean 4 or 5 weeks before November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you laying floor at that time?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir; we laid floor on the fifth and then we were on the\r\nsixth when this happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever meet a fellow named Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, he worked with us and he didn't associate with us too\r\nmuch. He was kind of quiet. He didn't like to talk too much to us or\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say he worked with you; did he work laying floors?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, he was an order filler; he just worked the same place.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, quite a few times.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Ever see him on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever eat lunch with him?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. We all eat lunch together in this little domino room. We play\r\ndominoes and eat our lunch. He might walk in and lay around with us and\r\nhe would walk out. He didn't stay in there too long. I guess he didn't\r\nlike crowds.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November, what time did you go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. We start at eight but I believe I was a little late.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went to work on what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Sixth.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you work there all morning?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you get off work?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. That day?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At noon for your lunch hour or your lunch period?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. What time we left down for lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. We usually leave down about 5 to 12, something around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you go down stairs?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. By the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have sort of a race that day, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me about it.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, me and Bonnie Ray and, I am not too sure, I believe it\r\nwas Billy Lovelady, were on the same elevator, and Charles Givens and\r\nthe other guys were on the other one and we were racing down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which elevator were you on?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. We have two of them that go up, the same deal and I was on\r\nthe one facing east. There's an east and a west elevator and I was in\r\nthe one facing east.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Lee Oswald or hear him speak on the way down?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, he was up there and I believe someone asked if he\r\nwanted to go down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was there--on what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. That's what I'm not too sure; I believe he was on five or the\r\nsixth floor. I am not too sure but we were going down and I believe he\r\nwas on the fifth; I am not too sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. He said \"You all close the door on the elevator, I will be\r\ndown,\" or somethin'. I didn't pay too much attention. He said to leave\r\nthe elevator come down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him around there after that?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, I didn't see him around after that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. In that little domino room there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go after that?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I went outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With whom?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. With Billy Lovelady and Mr. Shelley and I was out there with\r\nJunior.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who is Junior?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I don't know his real name; I just know him by Junior.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was Bonnie Ray Williams ever out there with you?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, he stayed upstairs with Hank. Junior stayed up there but\r\nhe was down a little while and I guess he went upstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about Givens?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. He was down there with Shields, I guess--I mean Melvin--no,\r\nCarl, that's who he was with.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about Jack Dougherty?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. He was on all floors; I couldn't tell you where he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he outside?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, he was eating lunch; me and Jack Dougherty, same time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Dougherty ate his lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go outdoors after lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I don't know; I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who went outdoors with you?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Bill Shelley and Billy Lovelady; Carl was out there and\r\nCharles Givens.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You stood there how long before the parade came along?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I am not too sure; it was about 10 minutes, somewhere around\r\nthere. I am not too sure about that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see the President go by?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, I did. I seen him when he turned the corner and when he\r\nwent down that underpass thing and I heard them shots and I couldn't\r\nsee anything. There was a lot of people.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you standing when you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I was standing in front of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nI was on that grassy area part in front.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were not on the sidewalk?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, I was on the sidewalk, then I walked up to the grass to\r\nget a higher view and still couldn't see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear shots?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you make out the direction of the sound?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, I thought they came from the railroad tracks to the\r\nwest of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you were on the grass, were you south where you were?\r\nWhere were you with reference to the entrance to the Texas School Book\r\nDepository?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I was down to the west side, a little more to the west.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you west of the building itself?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were not in front of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I was directly in front, but then I walked a few steps down\r\nto the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you with reference to the west wall of the\r\nbuilding?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Oh, I was way far from it. I was across the street, I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you mean \"across the street\"?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, there's a little sidewalk right across the street and\r\nthere's some grass and things up there and that's where I was at. I\r\ncouldn't tell you exactly where I was, see, it's hard to explain.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you say you were not in front of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, not directly, not in front; I was across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you west of the west wall of the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, I was, well the building----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I understand but you were to the south of the building. You\r\nhad to be south of the building, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, I was south but I was, well, I guess you could say I\r\nwas in front of the building but not directly in front, well, I don't\r\nknow how to explain it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was standing with you?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, I walked away from the other guys because they were all\r\nin front of the building and I went across the street to get a closer\r\nview.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You walked which direction?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I just--right across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Right across Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The part of Elm that dead ends there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You crossed that and went on to the grassy part?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, it sounded to you that the shots came from what\r\ndirection?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. From the tracks on the west deal.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you look back at the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, I didn't think they came from there. I just looked\r\ndirectly to the railroad tracks and all the people started running up\r\nthere and I just ran along with them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go up to the railroad tracks?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything up there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, and they told us go back there and I went back inside the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go then?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Back inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you stay in there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Oh, about 15 minutes and they took us down to city hall to\r\nmake statements out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you made out your statement?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir; to the Police Department.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, just I minute, let's see----\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I helped this old man, this gentleman in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw an old man?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Right in front of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Right, you know, it was before it happened; I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long before the President went by?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I don't know. I think it was about 10 minutes, some place\r\naround there, 15 minutes; I'm not too sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about the old man; what was noticeable about him?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Well, he said he had kidney trouble, could I direct him to\r\nthe men's room and I said I would and I helped him up the steps and\r\nwalked him into the restroom and I opened the door for him and that's\r\nwhen I went inside to eat my lunch and then I seen him walk out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him talk to anyone in there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No; he went straight out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he in a car?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah, after I went outside I seen him driving out in a black\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He drove away?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him again?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, never seen him again.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just I minute, I want to show you a picture. I show you\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 369. I show you this picture. See this man in\r\nthis picture?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Recognize him?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, that's Billy Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just to identify it clearly, the man on the steps--well, you\r\nsee the man on the steps, do you not?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He is a white man, isn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you see his picture just above the picture of two colored\r\npeople, is that correct; would you describe it like that?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I am not going to mark this purposely because other witnesses\r\nhave to see it.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say that is Billy Lovelady?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, that is Billy Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, there is only one face that is clearly shown within the\r\nentrance-way of the Texas School Book Depository Building, isn't there?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And only one face of a person who is standing on the steps of\r\nthe Depository Building entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that one man you see there----\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes, that's Billy Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you came to work that morning, Danny----\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was Oswald there at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I believe I seen him once that morning on the first floor,\r\nsome place around there. I'm not too sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But did you see him go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him have in his possession any paper bag or\r\nsack that day?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. No, sir; I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This will be written up and you will have an opportunity to\r\nread it and sign it if you wish or you can waive signature. Which do\r\nyou wish? If you waive signature, you don't have to come back. Which do\r\nyou prefer? Do either one.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I don't understand too well.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She writes this up. Then if you wish, you can come in, read\r\nit over and, if there are any changes to be made, you make them and you\r\nswear to it before this young lady, who is a notary public, or you can\r\nwaive signature and we will send it on to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. I guess you all could send it on to the Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you waive signature?\r\n\r\nMr. ARCE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thanks very much for coming in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JOE R. MOLINA\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Joe R. Molina was taken at 4:50 p.m., on April 7,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you rise and raise your right hand, Mr. Molina?\r\n\r\n(Witness complying.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give\r\nwill be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help\r\nyou God?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Joe R. Molina.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your address?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. 4306 Brown.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me something about yourself; where were you born?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I was born here in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was your education?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I went to Crozier Tech High School and I finished\r\nafter I came back from the service and at that time my intention was to\r\ngo to college but I got married and instead went to business college.\r\nThen later on after attending about 5 months business college, I had\r\nto find a job because my wife was expecting a baby, consequently, I\r\nstarted working on-the-job training at the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what date?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I started working in February of 1947.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you been working there?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. 16 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 16 years?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you wrote the Commission a letter asking to testify,\r\ndidn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you happen to do that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I called in. I didn't know whether I was going to be\r\ncalled or not and they told me, you know, that I should write a letter\r\nand ask the Commission, you know. (Letter marked Molina Exhibit A.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You wanted to be heard, is that right, before the Commission?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have something particularly you wanted to tell us?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, on November 23d following the assassination, I was\r\npaid a visit by the local police department at 1:30 in the morning and\r\nthey sort of wanted to tie me up with this case in some way or another\r\nand they thought that I was implicated.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What makes you think they thought you were implicated?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, they were looking for something. I don't know what it\r\nwas they were looking for in the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They came to your house here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. That's right, woke up my wife and children; scared my wife\r\nhalf to death.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they search the house?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they have a search warrant?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I don't know whether they did or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they tell you what they were looking for?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, they asked me questions whether I knew different\r\npersons that belong to the G.I. Forum----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To what?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. G.I. Forum, this club I belonged to here in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you spell that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. G.I. F-o-r-u-m [spelling].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. G.I. F-o-r-u-m [spelling] in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was it that asked you that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I think it was Mr. Garroway did most of the\r\nquestioning and police Lieutenant Revill, I believe--yeah, that was his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they ask you?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. They asked me if I knew certain persons that had come\r\ninto the forum when it was first initiated and if I was acquainted\r\nwith them and if I associated with them, so forth and so on. I said\r\nmy activities were limited to the club. I didn't have any social, you\r\nknow, I wasn't intimate with them but merely a club that was started. I\r\nwas asked by my pastor to go see about this particular club which I did\r\nand consequently, the club met at the church auditorium after it was\r\nfounded and one of the parish priests was a chaplain.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it a Catholic, Roman Catholic organization?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. The G.I. Forum?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No; the forum is a veterans' club.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What else happened?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, after the police came, they didn't know whether--they\r\nwere undecided what to do, whether they would take me in for\r\nquestioning or not and so they decided evidently, since I told\r\nthem--they asked me if they could take a look around. I said \"Sure, I\r\ndon't have anything to hide, look around\". They looked around and did\r\na lot of searching and my wife started to get back in bed. She didn't\r\nknow that was going on. She thought they just want to question me and\r\nthey told her she had to get out of bed and go into the living room\r\nand the kids were in the back room. I only have two bedrooms and the\r\nkids were sleeping out there. They woke up the kids; they were looking\r\nin their room, so they started questioning the kids, too. They started\r\nto ask me questions and ask the kids about it. In other words, to\r\ncorroborate our statements. I didn't know at the time they were doing\r\nit but later on found out. They couldn't find anything. I knew they\r\nwouldn't find anything. I didn't know what they were looking for in\r\nthe first place. They decided to bring me down to the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment for questioning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go down to the police department?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, they asked me if I would go down the next morning\r\nand I said yes, I would go down the next morning. I would rather go\r\ndown the next morning than now. It was already past 2, so the next\r\nmorning my wife drove me down. I got there about 11. My wife drove me\r\ndown and I got there about 10:30. The place was full of television\r\npeople and reporters swarming all over the place and they told me to\r\nwait in the room there and then I went into Chief Gannaway's office\r\nor whatever his name is. He said I was supposed to be questioned by\r\nMr. Fritz down there but that he wanted to talk to me after they\r\nquestioned me up there because they wanted to know more about the G.I.\r\nForum so I said \"I will come back when they get through questioning\r\nme.\" So I went up there and they told me to wait in an office and so I\r\nwaited there for about 30, 40 minutes and, oh, must have been longer\r\nthan that, they finally questioned me and they put me in a room and\r\nthere was a man from the FBI or Secret Service, I don't recall which\r\none it was. He was sitting on my right and there was a fellow from\r\nthe Dallas Police Department taking a statement and a fellow from the\r\nFBI introduced himself, said I'm so and so, show me his badge and so\r\nforth. The other fellow didn't say who he was or anything, just sat\r\nthere and so then they told me to wait there in that room and I did. I\r\nwas there for about 45 minutes and then the fellow came back from the\r\nFBI, said \"My God, are you still in here?\" I said \"Yes,\" he said \"How\r\nlong you been here?\" Here it was about 2 or 3 o'clock. I said \"I have\r\nbeen here since about 11; I haven't eaten lunch or haven't had a drink\r\nof water\". You know, I was just there and which he told this fellow,\r\nsaid \"Can't you let him go; he has been here. He has already given his\r\ntestimony statement, whatever he is going to give; you should let him\r\ngo.\" This fellow said \"No, he got to wait in there\" so I had to go\r\nback in there; about 10 or 15 minutes later, they came back and I went\r\nup to the office of Lieutenant Revill and he started asking a lot of\r\nquestions about the G.I. Forum, did I know such and such fellow--some\r\nI knew, they had been in the club. Naturally, I knew them though we\r\nweren't intimate friends, some were, some weren't. Then he gave me a\r\nbunch of names, I imagine they were in their so-called subversive files\r\nthat they claim they have; of course, I didn't know a lot of them. In\r\nfact, I didn't know most of them. I knew some of the names. I didn't\r\nknow some of the names they mentioned are kept in their files or not.\r\nAnyhow, they asked me--I had to--they didn't ask me--I had to just ask\r\nto sign a statement I belonged to the forum and certain members were\r\ncharter members of the forum and I said yes, I would sign it. I didn't\r\nsee anything wrong with it so I signed it and they told me I could go\r\nhome. It was 4:30 or 5 and they asked me if I had a ride home and I\r\nsaid no. They said \"Well, we'll give you a ride home, so one of the\r\nofficers there, plainclothes man, drove me home. When I got home, of\r\ncourse, there were about three or four cars at the house. My wife was\r\nall shook up and she said \"My God\" she said \"Don't you know what they\r\nbeen saying about you?\" I said \"No, I don't know what they are saying\r\nabout me.\" She said \"Don't you know you been on TV and the news media\r\nacross the nation saying you are on the so-called list with the Dallas\r\nPolice Department claiming that you associate with persons of\"--see\r\nif I can quote it right--I was known to associate with persons of\r\nsubversive background.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was on TV?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who put that on TV?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. It was a statement made by Chief Curry.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. By whom?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Chief Curry and I says \"No, I didn't know anything about\r\nit. I was just being questioned.\" They said \"Well, did you tell them\r\nto release your name?\" I said \"I don't know who gave my name out, gave\r\nout the information.\" So, they were very concerned because at first,\r\nI didn't think it was--I figured they would make a retraction and\r\nI would be cleared, so forth and so on and nothing came out on the\r\nradio and nothing was said and I called the Police Department and told\r\nthem I wanted to talk to Chief Curry and they said he was busy. I was\r\ntalking to, I think someone, fellow named King. He answered the phone\r\nand he said any retraction has to come from Chief Curry. I called the\r\nAssociated Press which released the statement to the news media and\r\nthey wouldn't give me any satisfaction. They told me I would have to\r\nget in touch with some fellow in New York or something like that, so\r\nthat was--I couldn't get any satisfaction. I was accused of something I\r\ndidn't know anything about.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they ever give you a retraction?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now----\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. And, consequently, well, that happened on November 23d;\r\nmy boss was very upset about it. He said that the vice president of\r\nthe company, Mr. Campbell, they didn't say anything to me, they didn't\r\ncome to me and say \"Joe, we will stand by you, we don't believe it.\"\r\nNothing was said for about 10 days so I went in and told them, I said,\r\n\"You don't have to be afraid, I'm going to get this thing cleared. I\r\nam going to find somebody to clear me of this.\" They said \"You better\r\ndo it very fast because the president is very upset about it and we\r\nhave been getting a lot of calls and several people calling in and\r\nsaying he hires subversives\" and so forth and so on. I saw one letter\r\ndid say that. It came to them from some fellow said he wasn't going to\r\ndo business with that book firm because they hired Communists. I knew\r\nthey were probably under pressure. Well, on December 13, they called\r\nme in and said they wanted to talk with me and they told me that due\r\nto automation I was going to have to be replaced. That happened in\r\nDecember 13, about 3 weeks afterwards so I told them I said \"I don't\r\nreally think that's the reason why you're letting me go, it's probably\r\nbecause of this other thing.\" He said \"No, we got automation here, we\r\nare taking too much business in so we have to let you go.\" No news was\r\never given to me there was no machines for replacement, nothing, so I\r\nsaid--well, I didn't leave until December 30 and got all the routine\r\nwork I had been assigned was gradually shifted to another person. I was\r\nthere doing nothing. I finally left December 30 and I have received\r\na letter from a friend in California saying my name was in the paper\r\nstating that I had been labeled as a communist and I got a call from\r\nFlorida, from a good friend of mine saying they labeled me a communist\r\nand saying I was a friend of Oswald's.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know him?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No; I had seen him there in the building. I had seen him\r\nbut never talked with him or been introduced.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where are you working now?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I am working over here--that's another thing. I couldn't\r\nfind a job. Who is going to hire me? So I called this friend of mine\r\nhe belonged to the Dads Club where I go to church, Holy Trinity. His\r\nname is Mr. Redman, vice president at Neuhoff's. I called him about a\r\njob and he said \"No, I don't have anything in your line of work.\" I\r\nhappened to mention to him I used to do credit union work and at that\r\ntime they happened to be looking for a man and that's the reason I\r\nfound this particular job.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are working at Neuhoff's Employees Credit Union?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are you a bookkeeper; is that what you usually do is\r\nbookkeeping?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pursue it any further; did you file any actions of\r\nany sort?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I have an attorney that is working towards something.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went to work what date----\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I went to work in February 1947.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For the Texas School Book Depository at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes; at that time they were located at 2210 Pacific.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, November 22, 1963, the place you worked was in the\r\nsecond floor of this School Book Depository Building?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go out on the street to see the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes; I was standing on the front steps.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. With whom?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Right next left of me was Mr. Williams and close to there\r\nwas Mrs. Sanders.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Pauline Sanders?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Roy Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes; he was standing with Mr. Campbell; they were going out\r\nto lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They were in front of you were they?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw the President's car pass?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anything after that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I heard the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where--what was the source of the sound?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Sort of like it reverberated, sort of kind of came from the\r\nwest side; that was the first impression I got. Of course, the first\r\nshot was fired then there was an interval between the first and second\r\nlonger than the second and third.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I just stood there, everybody was running and I\r\ndidn't know what to do actually, because what could I do. I was just\r\nshocked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, this fellow come to me--Mr. Williams said, somebody\r\nsaid, somebody was shooting at the President, somebody, I don't\r\nknow who it was. There was some shooting, you know, and this fellow\r\nsaid \"What can anybody gain by that\"; he just shook his head and I\r\njust stood there and shook my head. I didn't want to think what was\r\nhappening, you know, but I wanted to find out so I went down to where\r\nthe grassy slope is, you know, and I was trying to gather pieces of\r\nconversation of the people that had been close by there and somebody\r\nsaid \"Well, the President has been shot and I think they shot somebody\r\nelse\", something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Mr. Truly go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you saw him go into the building?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I was right in the entrance.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see a police officer with him?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I didn't see a police officer. I don't recall seeing a\r\npolice officer but I did see him go inside.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see a white-helmeted police officer any time there in\r\nthe entrance?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, of course, there might have been one after they\r\nsecured the building, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No, I mean when Truly went in; did you see Truly actually go\r\ninto the building?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I saw him go in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you standing?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Right at the front door; right at the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Outside the front door?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, outside the front door I was standing; the door was\r\nright behind me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you standing on the steps?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, on the uppermost step.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You actually saw Truly go in?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yeah.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were still standing there?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long was it after you heard the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Oh, I would venture to say maybe 20 or 30 seconds\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had somebody come up and said the President was shot before\r\nyou saw Truly go in?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know a girl named Gloria Calvary?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Gloria come up?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Yes, she came. I was in the lobby standing there and she\r\ncame in with this other girl.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did she say?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. She said \"Oh, my God, Joe, he's been shot.\" They were both\r\nhorrified. I said \"Are you sure he was shot?\" She said \"Oh, Joe, I'm\r\nsure. I saw his hair fly up and I'm sure he was shot\" something to that\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You left the building that day about what time and went home?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Oh, it must have been around, I would say, I would say it\r\nwas about 2, maybe a little before that, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I had seen him in the building, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever speak to him?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No; I never spoke to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him at all on November 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I never did see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any strangers in the building on that day\r\nNovember 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. No; like I stated before, I came in at--to work at 7 in the\r\nmorning because I had a key and I was on the second floor all the time,\r\nnever did leave except maybe to go to the restroom, something like\r\nthat. Then I ate my lunch, took my lunch and ate it and went downstairs\r\nabout 12:15.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Okay, thanks very much, Mr. Molina. This will be written up\r\nfor your signature if you wish; you can come in and sign it or you can\r\nwaive your signature, whichever you wish. If you wish to sign it, this\r\nyoung lady will notify you when it is typed and you can come in, read\r\nit, and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I just wanted to state in the record that I want to deny\r\nany accusations if there is any doubt in anybody's mind.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; there is nobody I ever heard has accused you of anything.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. I know there's a fella that I talk with that belongs to the\r\nor had worked with the FBI that knows my position in this thing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I never heard anybody accuse you of any wrongdoing in\r\nconnection with this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. In fact, Bill Lowery worked with the FBI.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't have to worry about that; no one is accusing you of\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Except the local people here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you want to sign it or do you want to waive your\r\nsignature; how do you feel about it? It's your option; you can do\r\neither way.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Well, I would like to.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. See it and sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. See it and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She will notify you then. She will tell you when to come in.\r\n\r\nMr. MOLINA. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF JACK EDWIN DOUGHERTY\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Jack Edwin Dougherty was taken at 10:50 a.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A.

What kind of work did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, of course, a year or so, you might say--just work\r\nin grocery stores until I was 19 and volunteered for the Armed Services\r\nin October--October 24, 1942.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long were you in the service?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. 2 years, 1 month, 17 days, to be exact.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you were discharged from the Service, then, after the\r\nWar, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do during the service--during your period in the\r\nservice?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, you might say just about a little bit of\r\neverything, from guard duty to----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have any active service?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, no--I volunteered for active service, but they\r\nsaid you couldn't very well volunteer--you have to be drafted, so they\r\nsaid, they told me at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever leave the United States during the War?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY.

Or to the South Seas?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You stayed in this country all the time?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you ever have any difficulty with your speech?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never had any?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever have any difficulty in the Army with any medical\r\ntreatment or anything of that sort?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. None at all?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after you got out of the Army?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, jobs were pretty scarce about the time I got out\r\nof the service, so I just went from place to place and applied and put\r\nmy application in, so I started over here at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository and put my application in there and I got it through the\r\nSuburban Employment Agency, and I been working there ever since.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that was when--in 1940, was it, you started to work at\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. September 17, 1940.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 1940 what?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Let's see, I have been with them 11 years--that would\r\nbe----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be 1952, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--that's 1952.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. 1952?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; that's right, to be exact.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do between the time you got out of the service\r\nand 1952?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I didn't do anything to be frank with you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You stayed at home?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you live with your father and mother?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you ever been married?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you still live with your father and mother?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what kind of work have you been doing at the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository in the last few years?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh--shipping clerk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what kind of work is that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, that's when they bring the orders from on the\r\nsecond floor, and in other words, you fill them from the--they are\r\norders, I guess you would call them orders, to fill from there, and\r\noutside of doing little odd jobs besides that--that's it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know a fellow named Lee Harvey Oswald that worked at\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I'll be frank with you, Mr. Ball, I don't believe\r\nnobody knew him too well. You might say he wouldn't have too much to\r\nsay to anybody. He just stayed all to hisself, and I'll be frank with\r\nyou, I just flat didn't know him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on November 22, 1963, that's the day the President was\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I got there--it was after 7 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you usually get there in the morning at 7 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why do you get there at 7 instead of 8, when the rest of the\r\nmen get there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, you might say, I have a little--extra chores to do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You do that--you get there at 7 all the time, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, I've been doing it for 11 years.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's what Mr. Truly told me, that you get there real early.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you did get there about 7 that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's see, Mr. Dougherty, you said that you have some extra\r\nchores--what are those extra chores?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I have to see to it that the water system is pumped up.\r\nIn other words, the air pressure is up to where--up to 40 pounds so\r\nthat if it isn't pumped up, the alarm goes off, and the ADT runs that\r\nalarm system, and we immediately call Mr. Truly and of course they call\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the ADT?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's that--I don't know too much about it--it has\r\nsomething to do with the alarm system they have got down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean the pressure, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that a fire-alarm system?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--you could call it that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what else do you do there early in the morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, let's see, I have to check and see that there is\r\nno leaks in the building, that the pipes are not leaking somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Anything else you do?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No; I believe that just about covers it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time do you usually go to lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, usually about 12 o'clock or 12 noon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you carry your lunch most of the time from home?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where do you usually eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, they have got what they call a domino room in\r\nthere and I usually eat it in there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You usually eat your lunch in the domino room?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how long do you take for lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, from 12 to 12:45.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Forty-five minutes?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you always take a full hour?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; I usually do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, do you remember the day of November 22, 1963; you do,\r\ndon't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The day that the President was shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember what time you went to work that day?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--let's see--it was 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you go to work that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, that particular morning--let's see, we didn't go\r\nback.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; I mean, what time did you go to work the first thing in\r\nthe morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It was 8 o'clock when we were actually started to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you get to the building?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. At a quarter to 7.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At a quarter to 7?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told the FBI officers that you got there about 7 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I mean, inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--when I got inside the building it was 7 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You parked your car?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I don't have a car--I have to ride the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Oswald come to work that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--when he first come into the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came in the door?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him come in the door?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; I saw him when he first come in the door--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have anything in his hands or arms?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, not that I could see of.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time of day was that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That was 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was about 8 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What door did he come in?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, he came in the back door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you then?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I was--sitting on top of the wrapping table.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, do you remember that you gave a statement to the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation and to a man by the name of Ellington, or a Mr.\r\nAnderton, the day after--the 23d of November?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--I talked to so many of them--it is kind of hard to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And there is a statement that they took when they talked to\r\nyou and in it you said, \"I recall vaguely, having seen Lee Oswald, when\r\nhe came to work at about 8 a.m. today.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I did--that morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That seems to be dated the 22d day of November 1963.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The full statement is, \"I am employed by the Texas School\r\nBook Depository, 411 Elm Street, Dallas, as an order filler, and reside\r\nat 1827 South Marsalis Street, Dallas, Tex.\"\r\n\r\nDid you tell them that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. \"I started to work today, 11-22-63, at about 7 a.m. o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nDid you tell them that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The statement says, \"I recall vaguely having seen Lee Oswald,\r\nwhen he came to work at about 8 a.m. today.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, is that a very definite impression that you saw him that\r\nmorning when he came to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, oh--it's like this--I'll try to explain it to you\r\nthis way--you see, I was sitting on the wrapping table and when he came\r\nin the door, I just caught him out of the corner of my eye--that's the\r\nreason why I said it that way.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he come in with anybody?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was alone?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; he was alone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recall him having anything in his hand?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I didn't see anything, if he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pay enough attention to him, you think, that you\r\nwould remember whether he did or didn't?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I believe I can--yes, sir--I'll put it this way; I\r\ndidn't see anything in his hands at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, your memory is definite on that, is it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, you would say positively he had nothing in\r\nhis hands?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I would say that--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or, are you guessing?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw him come in the door?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The back door on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It was in the back door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, that back door is the door that opens onto what? That\r\nback door would be the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it opens where?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. On the back dock--on the back dock side over there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That would be what direction from the first floor--what wall\r\nof the first floor--north?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, let's see, to be frank with you--I don't know\r\nwhich one it would be.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there only one back door?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; there is only one back door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him again that morning?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; just one more time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That was on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time of day?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It was about 11 o'clock--that was the last time I saw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was he doing up there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, as far as I could tell, he was getting some\r\nstock--as far as I could tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were you doing there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I was getting some stock also.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were there some other workmen up there at the time?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Not that I know of.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, do you remember Shelley, Dan Arce, Bonnie Williams,\r\nBill Lovelady, and Charlie Givens who were working up there that\r\nmorning--laying floor on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, yes; they were laying floor--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were they there at the time you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, yes, sir; they were there--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the same time you saw Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir; just about that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And how long were you on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, just long enough to get some stock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you go then?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I went to the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I went to the fifth floor to get some stock also\r\non the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Then, just about that time--I thought I heard----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wait a minute--did you go to lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I went back downstairs to eat lunch--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, it was 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you talked to the FBI men, I've got a statement here\r\ndated the 19th of December 1963, a statement from Special Agent William\r\nO. Johnson, and he reports that you told him that you saw Lee Harvey\r\nOswald at approximately 8 a.m. when he, Oswald, arrived.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That you saw Oswald again at approximately 11 a.m. on the\r\nsixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But you didn't see him again after that, is that your\r\ntestimony?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the truth?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it also says, this report from Mr. Johnson, states that\r\nyou told him that just prior to 12 noon you and five other men were\r\nworking on the sixth floor. Were you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes; we were working on the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What were you doing?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I was getting some stock off of the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You weren't helping the men lay floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go down to lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. The first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you get down there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well--used the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go down alone or with someone?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I went down alone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. In the domino room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what time did you go back to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, at 12:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know that the President was going to pass in a\r\nmotorcade that noon?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, they said something about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you intend to go out and watch him?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I would have loved to have went out and watched\r\nhim but the steps were so crowded--there was no way in the world I\r\ncould get out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you take a look at it--did you go out and take a look at\r\nit, or didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well--no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you were on the first floor in the domino room when you\r\nfinished your lunch, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you stay there any length of time after you finished\r\nyour lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir--just a short length of time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, then, I went back to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where did you go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Let me see--oh, up to the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go to the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, it was about 12:40--it was about 12:40.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you heard any shots before that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes--I heard one--it sounded like a backfire.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when you heard that shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I was on the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were on the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, when you left your lunch, did you go to the fifth floor\r\nor the sixth floor to go back to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I went on the fifth floor when I was getting ready to go\r\ndown to eat lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; and then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, at that time--I was about 10 feet away----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Wait a minute--did you hear the shots before or after you had\r\nyour lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Before--before I ate my lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard shots before you ate your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Let's see--yes, I believe I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now, you remember having your lunch, do you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember after you had your lunch, you went back to\r\nwork that day?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you talked on the day this accident happened, on the\r\n22d of November 1963, in a statement made to the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation and, Mr. Dougherty, you told them you went down to the\r\nfirst floor to eat your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that you went back to work?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you told him on the 19th day of December, Mr. Johnson,\r\nthat you went back to work on the sixth floor, and as soon as you\r\narrived on the sixth floor, you went down to the fifth floor to get\r\nsome stock?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And while you were on the fifth floor, you heard a loud noise?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right--it sounded like a car backfiring.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you hear more than one loud explosion or noise?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No; that was the only one I heard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You only heard one?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where did it sound like it came from?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It sounded like it came from overhead somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From overhead?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you get to the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were on the fifth floor when you heard this, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which elevator did you take?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, you see, there's one on this side and one on this\r\nside--the one on this side is the one I took.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now, \"The one on this side and the one on this side,\"\r\ndoesn't mean much when it's written down.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I know it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me whether it was the east side or the west side\r\nelevator?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. East side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is it the one that you punch a button on?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or the one that you use a control on?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It's the one you push a button on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The one you push a button on?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I believe that is the west side, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, I believe it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, that's the one you took up?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you take that--to what floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I took it up to the sixth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, when I got through getting stock off of the sixth\r\nfloor, I came back down to the fifth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do on the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I got some stock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what happened then?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, then immediately I heard a loud noise--it sounded\r\nlike a car backfiring, and I came back down to the first floor, and I\r\nasked Eddie Piper, I said, \"Piper, what was that?\" I says, \"Has the\r\nPresident been shot?\" He said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't say--did you say, \"Has the President been\r\nshot?\"--you told the FBI agent that you went down to the first floor\r\nand you saw a man named Eddie Piper and asked him if he heard a loud\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I asked him that too.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Piper said he had heard three loud noises and told you\r\nthat somebody had just shot the President; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who mentioned the fact that the President had been shot\r\nfirst--you or Eddie Piper?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Eddie Piper.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say anything to Piper about the President being shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you talked to Eddie Piper, did you know that the\r\nPresident had been shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir; I didn't know that at the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When is the first time you heard that the President had been\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. When Eddie told me that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Eddie told you that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told Mr. Johnson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nthat when you were on the fifth floor, you heard a loud noise and it\r\nappeared to have come from within the building, but you couldn't tell\r\nwhere--you told him that on the 19th; did you tell him that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the day that this happened, on the 22d of November, you\r\ntold the FBI agents Ellington and Anderton that you heard \"a loud\r\nexplosion which sounded like a rifle shot coming from the next floor\r\nabove me.\"\r\n\r\nNow, did you tell them that it sounded like a rifle shot, coming from\r\nthe next floor above you, or didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well; I believe I told them it sounded like a car\r\nbackfiring.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, did you tell them it sounded like it was from the floor\r\nabove you, or didn't you tell them that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did not tell them that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did it sound like it came from the floor above you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, at the time it did--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me this--when you heard that explosion or whatever\r\nit was--that loud noise, where were you on the fifth floor--tell me\r\nexactly where you were?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I was about 10 feet from the west elevator--the\r\nwest side of the elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's the elevator that uses the push button; is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what were you doing?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I was getting some stock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what did you do then?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I came on back downstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you come downstairs?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I used that push button elevator on the west side.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear Mr. Truly yell anything up the elevator shaft?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I didn't hear anybody yell.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or, did you see Mr. Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, when the FBI men--I imagine it was who it was--he\r\nshowed me his credentials, but he asked me who the manager was, and I\r\ntold him, \"Mr. Truly.\" He told me to go find him. Well, I didn't know\r\nwhere he was so I started from the first floor and just started looking\r\nfor him, and by the time I got to the sixth floor, they had found a gun\r\nand shells.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you went up to the sixth floor, it was after they found\r\nthe shotgun and shells?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, sir; and I found out later he was on the fourth\r\nfloor, which I didn't find.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see a gun around there?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir; I sure didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see anybody with a gun in the place?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any strangers in the building that day?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see Lee Oswald carry any sort of large package?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, I didn't, but some of the fellows said they did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who said that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, Bill Shelley, he told me that he thought he saw\r\nhim carrying a fairly good-sized package.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did Shelley tell you that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, it was--the day after it happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are you sure you were on the fifth floor when you heard the\r\nshots?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes, I'm positive.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see any other employee on the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir; I didn't see nobody--there wasn't nobody on the\r\nfifth floor at all--it was just myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told me that just before you heard the shots, you had\r\nbeen on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then you went down to the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody on the sixth floor when you were there,\r\nbefore you went to the fifth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Oh, yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, there was Bill Shelley, Billy Lovelady----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was in the morning, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That wasn't after lunch, was it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After lunch, did you ever see them on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you hear this shot either before or after lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. It was before lunch--it was before lunch.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think it was before lunch you heard the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. I believe it was--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you were alone, were you?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all I have to ask you, and this will be written up and\r\nif you would like to come down and read it and sign it, you can, or you\r\ncan waive your signature.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want to do?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, whatever you want to do--it doesn't make any\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you like to come down and read it over and sign it?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. Well, if you've got time I'll sign it now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, we have to write it up--this has to be written up and\r\nit will be so that you can read it. This young lady will notify you and\r\nyou can come down and read it over and sign it.\r\n\r\nWill you do that?\r\n\r\nMr. DOUGHERTY. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL.

Have you been janitor ever since you were employed?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever know a fellow named Lee Oswald, that worked\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir; I know of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You knew of him?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know him personally?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL.

If he did, I didn't ever hear him. He mumbled something and\r\nhe would just keep walking.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November 1963, you remember that day, don't you?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time did you go to work that day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was your usual time to go to work?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL.

Did you ever see him again that day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. You mean all day--the rest of the day?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that the last time you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Just at 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you at 12 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Down on the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Well, I said to him--\"It's about lunch time. I believe I'll\r\ngo have lunch.\" So, he says, \"Yeah\"--he mumbled something--I don't know\r\nwhether he said he was going up or going out, so I got my sandwich off\r\nof the radiator and went on back to the first window of the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The first window on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, not the first window--but on the first floor about the\r\nsecond window on the first floor. I was intending to sit there so I\r\ncould see the parade because the street was so crowded with people--I\r\ndidn't see anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said you sat at the second window--that would be what\r\nwindow from the corner?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Well, from the front door, you know where the front door\r\nis--going back right down Elm, it's the second window from the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say you sat down there?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you sit on?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. On a box.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you see out the window?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, I could see out the window but I couldn't see\r\nanything--too many people.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you eat your lunch there?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you when the President's motorcade went by?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Now, I don't know--I was sitting there, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When the President went by, where were you sitting?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Probably sitting there in the same place.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you move from there from the time you had your lunch\r\nuntil the President went by?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, I moved--when there was a shot, I moved.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When there was a shot you moved?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the time you had your lunch until the shot, did you move?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were at that window all of the time?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. All the time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever go up on the sixth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you there at any time that day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you above the first floor that day up to the time of the\r\nshot?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Before the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. At 11 o'clock I went to the fourth floor to pick up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You went to the fourth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, at 11 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you worked there for how long?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I would just take about 10 or 15 minutes to pick up--not\r\nquite that long, to pick up the mail and stuff in the fourth floor\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I came back down to the third floor and picked up and from\r\nthere to the second and picked up and on to the first floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that what you usually did--was pick up?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir; every day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you do that every day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You pick up mail?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You pick up mail from what offices?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. From--what the name of the office is?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The different offices?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Oh, I pick up mail first--on the fourth floor is Scott\r\nPharmacy, and I come down on the third floor and I pick up there in\r\nthe hall, you know, they have a hallway there and they put it out on\r\nthe table--the packages and the mail, and I pick it up there unless\r\nthey've got a name on the boards to see them in the office and then I\r\ngo in the office. That's on the third floor. I come down on the second\r\nfloor and I pick up for Southwestern. I goes in the office and that's\r\nthe only office I go in there at Southwestern. Like I say--unless there\r\nis anything on the board that says see Lon Cunningham, and then I go\r\nin there. That's on the second floor, and from there back down to the\r\nfirst floor, and I unloads on the table on the first floor and that's\r\nwhen I'm through--I don't go back no more.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You do that every day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At a certain time?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At what time?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. At 11 and 3.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, that day, November 22, 1963, you picked up the mail on\r\nthe fourth floor at 11 did you?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then came to the third?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then to the second?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what time did you come to the first floor?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Well, it was close to--around about--it must have been about\r\n11:30--about 11:30 when I came back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you leave the first floor from then on until lunch time,\r\nfrom 11:30 until 12?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time was it that you spoke to Oswald and said you\r\nthought you would have your lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Just about 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And do you remember exactly what he said?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir; I don't remember exactly. All I remember him was\r\nmuttering out something--I didn't know whether he said he was going up\r\nor going out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He said something like that?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes--something like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see what he did?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see where he went?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told me that you went to the window?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is the second window to the right?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of the front door--that would be looking toward Elm Street,\r\nis that right?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And were you sitting there when you heard the shot?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me what you heard?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I heard one shot, and then the next shot went off--the one\r\nthat shot him and I got on up and went on back, back where they make\r\ncoffee at the end of the counter where I could see what happened and\r\nbefore I could get there, the third shot went off, and I seen the\r\npeople all running and in a few minutes someone came in the building,\r\nand I looked up and it was the bossman and a policeman or someone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say you heard one shot--you heard two shots and you got\r\nup and then what happened, where did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I came out to the end of the counter where they make coffee\r\nthere by the stand.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said you did it so you could see out better?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir; I did it to see what time it was--when all this\r\nhappened--to see what time it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time was it?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. It was about between 12:30--between 12:27 and\r\n12:30--something like that, as near as I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you tell where the shots were coming from?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir--I couldn't, not for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The direction?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir; I couldn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you look out the window later?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No more--no, sir; I didn't go back to any window.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mentioned you saw Truly?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I don't know whether it was a policeman or FBI or who it\r\nwas, but another fellow was with him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And where were you?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Standing right there where they make coffee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they do?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. He ran in and yelled, \"Where is the elevator?\" And I said,\r\n\"I don't know, sir, Mr. Truly.\"\r\n\r\nThey taken off and went on up the stairway and that's all I know about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you at any time go above the fourth floor on that date?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you at any time go that day up above the fourth floor?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No--no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never did--either before or after the shots?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, that day, you went over to the sheriff's office and made\r\na statement, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir--no, sir; not that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you the next day?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go to the sheriff's department?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. I went to the county--yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you tell them at any time that you saw Lee about 12\r\no'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that Lee said, \"I'm going up to eat?\"\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. He said either \"up\" or \"out\"--that's the way I reported it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's what you told them?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on that day, did you tell them that the shots that you\r\nheard seemed to come from inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did tell them that?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that your best impression then?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes; they seemed like they did come from the building, you\r\nknow, by the vibration of that window--it seemed like nobody had shot\r\nin the window from the outside--it might have been coming from the\r\nbuilding--is what I figured.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told them that day that you thought it came from inside\r\nthe building?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From inside the building?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, this statement you made to the sheriff's department,\r\nI'll show it to you--that's a copy there and is that your signature?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Yes; that's my signature.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. We'll attach that as Exhibit A to your deposition.\r\n\r\n(Instrument marked by the reporter as \"Piper Exhibit No. A,\" for\r\nidentification.)\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This deposition will be written up and you can come down here\r\nand look it over and sign it, if you wish.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or, you can waive your signature, just as you wish. Do you\r\nhave any choice--which had you rather do?\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Well, what is supposed to be done--I don't really quite\r\nunderstand?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You can do it either way. You see, we are going to write it\r\nup--this young lady will write it up and if you want to come down and\r\nsign it, you can come down and sign it, or you don't need to sign it.\r\nYou can waive your signature and we will send it on as it is written\r\nup. It is up to you which you would rather do.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Well, I can sign it, but I don't know when I am supposed to\r\ncome back to sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you will be notified.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. All right. I'll do that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, she will call you and ask you to come back and\r\nsign it.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. All right, I'll come back and sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMr. PIPER. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MISS VICTORIA ELIZABETH ADAMS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Miss Victoria Elizabeth Adams was taken at 2:15 p.m.,\r\non April 7, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office\r\nBuilding, Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin,\r\nassistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you want to stand and raise your right hand, please. Do\r\nyou solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nPresident's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy shall\r\nbe the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\r\nGod?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Would you please state your name?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Victoria Elizabeth Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you known as Vickie Adams?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where do you live?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. 4906 Wenonah, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I am employed as an office survey representative.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By whom?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Scott Foresman Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where do you work?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. On the fourth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. 411 Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is at the corner of Elm and Houston?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That is correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I might ask how old are you?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Twenty-three.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you born originally? In Texas?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. San Francisco, Calif.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you go to school in San Francisco?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I attended part of my grammar school and high school in San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you graduated from high school?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. In San Francisco, that's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Following that I entered the Ursaline Order in St. Mary's,\r\nOhio, and I left there as a novice in 1961.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do from there?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went to Atlanta, Ga. and taught school at the Immaculate\r\nHeart of Mary School. And following that I came to Dallas and was\r\nemployed by the Holiday Inn Central during the summer months, and I\r\nobtained a teaching position at St. Monica's School here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And you taught at St. Monica for some period of time?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes; for 1 year.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went to work for Scott Foresman?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went to work for Scott Foresman.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you at work on November 22, 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you aware of the fact that the President's motorcade\r\nwas going to go right by your building?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How did you learn of this information?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Through newspaper media and also conversation.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember when you first read about it in the papers?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir; I don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it have been before November 22d?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when the motorcade passed?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I was at the----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you inside or outside the building?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I was inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Fourth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you watch the motorcade through a window?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sometimes that is kind of complicated to try and pick out\r\nwhich window if you are counting from the right or left, so I am going\r\nto count from the east side of the building to the west side of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nNow the windows are separate windows, but they are kind of in pairs, so\r\nto speak. Were you standing on the first pair of windows, either one of\r\nthose two windows?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Counting from the east side, were you standing in the second\r\npair of windows?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the east side, were you standing in the third pair, of\r\neither of those windows?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now of that third pair, from the east side, would it have\r\nbeen the east window or the west window?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. The west window.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So another way, if you don't count in pairs, but count in\r\nsingle units from the east side, you would have been in the sixth\r\nwindow from your left as you were facing out the window, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you standing with anyone?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. With whom?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I was standing with Sandra Styles, Elsie Dorman, and\r\nDorothy May Garner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Will you state what you saw, what you did, and what you\r\nheard?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I watched the motorcade come down Main, as it turned from\r\nMain onto Houston, and watched it proceed around the corner on Elm, and\r\napparently somebody in the crowd called to the late President, because\r\nhe and his wife both turned abruptly and faced the building, so we had\r\na very good view of both of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was their car as you got this good view, had it come\r\ndirectly opposite your window? Had it come to that point on Elm, or\r\nnot, if you can remember?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I believe it was prior, just a second or so prior to that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. And from our vantage point we were able to see what the\r\nPresident's wife was wearing, the roses in the car, and things that\r\nwould attract women's attention. Then we heard--then we were obstructed\r\nfrom the view.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By what?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. A tree. And we heard a shot, and it was a pause, and then a\r\nsecond shot, and then a third shot.\r\n\r\nIt sounded like a firecracker or a cannon at a football game, it seemed\r\nas if it came from the right below rather than from the left above.\r\nPossibly because of the report.\r\n\r\nAnd after the third shot, following that, the third shot, I went to the\r\nback of the building down the back stairs, and encountered Bill Shelley\r\nand Bill Lovelady on the first floor on the way out to the Houston\r\nStreet dock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say on the way out to the Houston Street dock, you\r\nmean now you were on the way out?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. While I was on the way out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was anyone going along with you?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir; Sandra Styles.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sometime after the third shot, and I don't want to get into\r\nthe actual period of time yet, you went back into the stockroom which\r\nwould be to the north of where your offices are located on the fourth\r\nfloor, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir; that's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got into the stockroom, where did you go?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went to the back stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are there any other stairs that lead down from the fourth\r\nfloor other than those back stairs in the rear of the stockroom?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Those stairs would be in the northwest corner of the\r\nbuilding, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You took those stairs. Were you walking or running as you\r\nwent down the stairs?\r\n\r\nMiss. ADAMS. I was running. We were running.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of shoes did you have on?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Three-inch heels.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had heels. Now, as you were running down the stairs, did\r\nyou encounter anyone?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Not during the actual running down the stairs; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After you left the Scott Foresman office and went into the\r\nstockroom, did you see anyone until you got to the stairs on the fourth\r\nfloor other than the person you were with?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Outside of our office employees; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would these office employees that you might have seen, all\r\nbe women?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you got to the stairs and you started going down the\r\nstairs. You went from the fourth floor to the third floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anyone on the stairs then?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. As you got to the stairs on the fourth\r\nfloor, did you notice whether or not the elevator was running?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. The elevator was not moving.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How do you know it was not moving on some other floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Because the cables move when the elevator is moved, and\r\nthis is evidenced because of a wooden grate.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By that you mean a wooden door with slats in it that you\r\nhave to lift up to get on the elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look to see if the elevator was moving?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. It was not; no, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was not moving?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you happen to see where the elevator might have been\r\nlocated?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you got to the third door, did you take a look at the\r\nelevator again at all, or not, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I can't recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you got off the stairs on the third floor, did you see\r\nanyone on the third floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you immediately went to the stairs going down from the\r\nthird to the second?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As you ran down the stairs, did you see anyone on the stairs?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. You got down to the second floor. Did you see\r\nanyone by the second floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you immediately turn and run and keep on running down\r\nthe stairs towards the first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got to the bottom of the first floor, did you see\r\nanyone there as you entered the first floor from the stairway?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who did you see?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Mr. Bill Shelley and Billy Lovelady.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see them on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Well, this is the stairs, and this is the Houston Street\r\ndock that I went out. They were approximately in this position here,\r\nso I don't know how you would describe that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are looking now at a first floor plan or diagram of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository, and you have pointed to a position where\r\nyou encountered Bill Lovelady and Mr. Bill Shelley?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It would be slightly east of the front of the east elevator,\r\nand probably as far south as the length of the elevator, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I have a document here called Commission's Exhibit No.\r\n496, which includes a diagram of the first door, and there is a No. 7\r\nand a circle on it, and I have pointed to a place marked No. 7 on the\r\ndiagram. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That is approximate.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Between the time you got off the stairs and the time you got\r\nto this point when you say you encountered them, which was somewhat to\r\nthe south and a little bit east of the front of the east elevator, did\r\nyou see any other employees there?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Any other people prior to the time you saw them?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you were running down the stairs on your trip down\r\nthe stairs, did you hear anyone using the stairs?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear anyone calling for an elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the foreman, Roy Truly? Did you see the\r\nsuperintendent of the warehouse, Roy S. Truly?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir; I did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about any motorcycle police officers?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now what did you do after you encountered Mr. Shelley and\r\nMr. Lovelady?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I said I believed the President was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what they said?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I proceeded out to the Houston Street dock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be on this same diagram? It is marked Houston\r\nStreet dock, and you went through what would be the north door, which\r\nis towards the rear of the first floor, is that correct?\r\n\r\nAnd down some stairs towards the rear of the dock?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you go from there?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I proceeded--which way is east and west?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. East is here. East is towards Houston, and west is towards\r\nthe railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nYou went east or west? Towards the railroad tracks or towards Houston\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went west towards the tracks.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far west did you go?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went approximately 2 yards within the tracks and there\r\nwas an officer standing there, and he said, \"Get back to the building.\"\r\nAnd I said, \"But I work here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"That is tough, get back.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Well, was the President shot?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"I don't know. Go back.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"All right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went back, only I went southwest.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, did you come back by way of the street, or did you\r\ncome back the same entrance you went out?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went back in through the front entrance, through the\r\nfront of the building?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Well, I didn't go back in right away.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nThere is a street that would be a continuation of Elm Street that\r\ngoes in front of the building, and Elm Street itself angles into the\r\nfreeway. Did you go back either of those streets?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir. I went by the one directly in front of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got there?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. When I got there, I happened to look around and noticed\r\nseveral of the employees, and I noticed Joe Molina, for one, was\r\nstanding in front of the building, and also Avery Davis, who works with\r\nme, and I said, \"What do you think has happened?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she said, \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I want to find out.\" I think the President is shot.\r\n\r\nThere was a motorcycle that was parked on the corner of Houston and Elm\r\ndirectly in front of the east end of the building, and I paused there\r\nto listen to the report on the police radio, and they said that shots\r\nhad been fired which apparently came either from the second floor or\r\nthe fourth floor window, and so I panicked, as I was at the only open\r\nwindow on the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did they say second floor or second floor from the top?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. It said second floor. So then I decided maybe I had better\r\ngo back into the building, and going up the stairs----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now at this time when you went back into the building, were\r\nthere any policemen standing in front of the building keeping people\r\nout?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. There was an officer on the stairs itself, and he was\r\nprohibiting people from entering the building, that is correct. But I\r\ntold him I worked there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he let you come back in?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Following that, I pushed the button for the passenger\r\nelevator, but the power had been cut off on the elevator, so I took the\r\nstairs to the second floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You then went all the way back to the northwest corner of\r\nthe building and took the same set of stairs you had previously taken\r\nto come down, or did you take the stairs by the passenger elevator?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. By the passenger elevator.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do those stairs go above floor 2?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the second floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went into the Texas School Book Depository office and\r\njust listened for a few minutes to the people that were congregating\r\nthere, and decided there wasn't anything interesting going on, and went\r\nout and walked around the hall to the freight elevator meaning the one\r\non the northwest corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would it have been the west or the east? The one nearest the\r\nstairs or the other one?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes; the one nearest the stairs.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I went into the elevator which was stopped on the second\r\nfloor, with two men who were dressed in suit and hats, and I assumed\r\nthey were plainclothesmen.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I tried to get the elevator to go to the fourth floor, but\r\nit wasn't operating, so the gentlemen lifted the elevator gate and we\r\nwent out and ran up the stairs to the fourth floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went back to the Scott Foresman Company offices?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now trying to reconstruct your actions insofar as the time\r\nsequence, which we haven't done, what is your best estimate of the time\r\nbetween the time the shots were fired and the time you got back to the\r\nbuilding? How much time elapsed? If you have any estimate. Maybe you\r\ndon't have one.\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I would estimate not more than 5 minutes elapsed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any particular reason why you make this estimation?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir; going down the stairs toward the back, I was\r\nrunning. I ran to the railroad tracks. I moved quickly to the front of\r\nthe building, paused briefly to talk to someone, listened only to the\r\nreport of the windows from which the shot supposedly was fired, and\r\nreturned to the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long do you think it was between the time the shots were\r\nfired and the time you left the window to start toward the stairway?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Between 15 and 30 seconds, estimated, approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long do you think it was, or do you think it took you to\r\nget from the window to the top of the fourth floor stairs?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I don't think I can answer that question accurately,\r\nbecause the time approximation, without a stopwatch, would be difficult.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long do you think it took you to get from the window to\r\nthe bottom of the stairs on the first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I would say no longer than a minute at the most.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you think that from the time you left the window on the\r\nfourth floor until the time you got to the stairs at the bottom of the\r\nfirst floor, was approximately 1 minute?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, approximately.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As I understand your testimony previously, you saw neither\r\nRoy Truly nor any motorcycle police officer at any time?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You heard no one else running down the stairs?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got to the first floor did you immediately proceed\r\nto this point where you say you encountered Mr. Shelley and Mr.\r\nLovelady?\r\n\r\nWell, you showed me on a diagram of the first floor that there was a\r\nplace which was south and somewhat east of the front part of the east\r\nelevator that you encountered Truly and Lovelady?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I saw them there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I mean; you saw them?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would that have been a matter of seconds after you got to\r\nthe bottom of the first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Definitely.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Less than 30 seconds?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know, or did you know Lee Harvey Oswald either by\r\nsight or by name?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I didn't know Lee Harvey Oswald, per se. I didn't know his\r\nname. I recognized him after I saw him on television, as having been\r\nwith some men, but I had no dealing with him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By that, you mean having been employed with some men by the\r\nTexas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. During the trip down the stairs on the way down did you ever\r\nencounter Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there any other information that you can think of that\r\nmight be relevant to anything connected with the assassination?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. At the time I left the building on the Houston Street dock,\r\nthere was an officer standing about 2 yards from the curb, and about\r\nfrom the curb across the street from the Texas School Depository,\r\nand about 4 yards from the corner of Houston and Elm, and when we\r\nwere running out the dock, going around the building, the officer was\r\nstanding there, and he didn't encounter us or ask us what we were doing\r\nor where we were going, and I don't know if that is pertinent.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No one stopped you from getting out of the building when you\r\nleft?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is helpful information. Is there any other information\r\nthat you have that could be relevant?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. There was a man that was standing on the corner of Houston\r\nand Elm asking questions there. He was dressed in a suit and a hat, and\r\nwhen I encountered Avery Davis going down, we asked who he was, because\r\nhe was questioning people as if he were a police officer, and we\r\nnoticed him take a colored boy away on a motorcycle, and this man was\r\nasking questions very efficaciously, and we said, \"I guess he is maybe\r\na reporter,\" and later on on television, there was a man that looked\r\nvery similar to him, and he was identified as Ruby.\r\n\r\nAnd on questioning some police officer, they said they had witnesses\r\nto the fact that he was in the Dallas Morning News at the time. And I\r\ndon't know whether that is relevant or what.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is all right, we want to get that information down. Was\r\nthis before you got back in the front door of the building that you saw\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir; while I was standing by the motorcycles.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That is all, I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Miss Adams, you have the opportunity if you would like, to\r\nread this deposition and sign it before it goes to Washington, or you\r\ncan waive the signing of it and just let the court reporter send it\r\ndirectly to us. Do you have any preference?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. I think I will let you use your own discretion.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It doesn't make any difference to us. If it doesn't make any\r\ndifference, we can waive it and you won't have to make another trip\r\ndown here.\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. That is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We want to thank you for your cooperation. We know that it\r\nhas taken time on your part. Would you also thank your employer?\r\n\r\nMiss ADAMS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF GENEVA L. HINE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Geneva L. Hine was taken at 2:45 p.m., on April 7,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Please stand up and hold up your right hand. Do you solemnly\r\nswear the testimony you will give the Commission will be the truth, the\r\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Geneva L. Hine.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where do you live.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. 2305 Oakdale Road in Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me something about yourself; where you were born\r\nand raised, and educated and what kind of work you have done.\r\n\r\nMiss. HINE. I was born and raised in Martinsville, Ind., and I\r\ngraduated from elementary and junior high and high school at that same\r\ntown. I attended the Ball State Teachers' College in Muncie, Ind.,\r\nand I attended Metropolitan Bible Institute in Suffern, N.Y., and I\r\nreceived my Bachelor of Science theology degree from Assembly of God\r\nCollege in Waxahachie, Tex.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do after that?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Oh, I have always worked as a one-girl office girl until the\r\njob I have now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you go to work at the Texas School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. In December 1956.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work do you do there?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I have the credit desk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, in November, November 22, 1963, where was your desk; in\r\nwhat part of the building?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. My desk was on the second floor, the inside wall just along\r\nby the corridor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you spend most of your time at your desk?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. At that time?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; at that time.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; the girls were gone and they wanted to go out and\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I mean did you spend most of your time in your work--it was a\r\ndesk job?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes; that's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go in the other floors of the building any?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; as my duties necessitated I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever know a fellow named Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you first meet him?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I never met him to know his name but I saw him every day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did you see him?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Downstairs in the warehouse or stockroom whichever you want\r\nto call it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The first floor?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him on any other floors?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I saw him on the second floor about noontime\r\nalmost every day. He would come in and ask for change, for a dime or\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him use any part of the second floor?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him spend the dime to buy anything with it?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; the coke machine isn't in our room and I wouldn't\r\nhave seen it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is the coke machine?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Out in the little lunchroom back of our office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever speak to Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever speak to you?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He never replied to you?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you say he was unfriendly?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I would.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him smile or laugh?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of an expression did he have on his face most of\r\nthe time?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I describe it as being stoic.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's a pretty good description if he doesn't smile.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. It was just----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever mention this to any of the people around there\r\nabout Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I mentioned it to Mr. Shelley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you tell him?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. One day I said to Mr. Shelley, \"Who is that queer duck you\r\nhave working down here\" and I said that just as a matter of slang\r\nbecause I've known Mr. Shelley for a long time and I was just talking\r\nto him, you see, and usually, all the boys that work down there speak\r\nto me because I have to go down there to pick up the little \"comp\" or\r\ngift slips on my desk. Every time I went by him I would speak to him,\r\nsay \"Good morning\" and he would never catch or meet my gaze so I just\r\nmade that remark to Mr. Shelley because I had spoken to him so many\r\ntimes and he never answered.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did Shelley say?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. He said that was just his way.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November 1963, did you know that there was to\r\nbe a motorcade or parade come by your building?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you find that out?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Sir, I don't remember. I probably heard over the news but I\r\ncannot remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were just aware of the fact?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes; I knew it and the girls were discussing it in the\r\noffice that morning. Many of them, probably six, had not seen the\r\nPresident close. You see, I had seen him on two different occasions\r\nand I had been very close to him and so they were lamenting that they\r\ncouldn't go out so I spoke up and said \"I will be glad to answer the\r\ntelephone so you girls may go out and see the motorcade\" and I had\r\npreviously answered the telephone when we were in the other building\r\nbefore we moved in this building, so they were delighted and I thought\r\nnothing about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they all go out?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; everyone went out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anyone left in the office part of the building on\r\nthat second floor office?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Only Mr. Williams and myself and he stayed with me because\r\nhe was working on his desk until he thought that the motorcade was\r\nabout there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then he went out?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. When he thought it was about there he said \"I think I will\r\ngo out for 5 minutes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is his name?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Otis N. Williams.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He works in the office, too?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have to change your desk over to another desk?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; to the middle desk on the front row.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there a switchboard?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; we have a telephone with three incoming lines, then\r\nwe have the warehouse line and we have an intercom system.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't have a switchboard?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Not now; we did in the other building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you alone then at this time?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you stay at your desk?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I was alone until the lights all went out and the\r\nphones became dead because the motorcade was coming near us and no one\r\nwas calling so I got up and thought I could see it from the east window\r\nin our office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go to the window?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you look out?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you see?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I saw the escort car come first up the middle of Houston\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Going north on Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; going north on Houston Street. I saw it turn left\r\nand I saw the President's car coming and I saw the President and saw\r\nhim waving his hand in greeting up in the air and I saw his wife and I\r\nsaw him turn the corner and after he turned the corner I looked and I\r\nsaw the next car coming just at the instant I saw the next car coming\r\nup was when I heard the shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many did you hear?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Three.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you tell where the shots were coming from?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; they came from inside the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Because the building vibrated from the result of the\r\nexplosion coming in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It appeared to you that the shots came from the building?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you know they were shots at the time?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; they sounded almost like cannon shots they were so\r\nterrific.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is when you were at the window, is that right?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; that is when I was at the window, because the\r\nnext car, you see, was coming up and turning and I looked. Of course\r\nI looked when I heard the shots. I just stood there and saw people\r\nrunning to the east up Elm Street. I saw people running; I saw people\r\nfalling down, you know, lying down on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was on Houston Street?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; Elm.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You could see--could you see any part of Elm?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. East, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You could see east on Elm?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I could see east on Elm. I saw them run across\r\neast on Elm away from where his car had gone and my first thought was\r\nif I could only see what happened, so I went out our front door into\r\nthe foyer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean the front door to the office?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That opens on----\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. The foyer, little hall, and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Steps lead down?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; but there is a door before the steps and the\r\nelevator is to my left and I went past the hall that goes to my right\r\nand I knocked on the door of Lyons and Carnahan; that's a publishing\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do then?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I tried the door, sir, and it was locked and I couldn't get\r\nin and I called, \"Lee, please let me in,\" because she's the girl that\r\nhad that office, Mrs. Lee Watley, and she didn't answer. I don't know\r\nif she was there or not, then I left her door. I retraced my steps back\r\nto where the hall turns to my left and went down it to Southwestern\r\nPublishing Co.'s door and I tried their door and the reason for this\r\nwas because those windows face out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On to Elm?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes; and on to the triple underpass.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I see.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. And there was a girl in there talking on the telephone and I\r\ncould hear her but she didn't answer the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the door locked?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was which company?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Southwestern Publishing Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you call to her?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. I called and called and shook the door and she didn't answer\r\nme because she was talking on the telephone; I could hear her. They\r\nhave a little curtain up and I could see her form through the curtains.\r\nI could see her talking and I knew that's what she was doing and then I\r\nturned and went through the back hall and came through the back door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Of your office, the second floor office?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes; and I went straight up to the desk because the\r\ntelephones were beginning to wink; outside calls were beginning to come\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they did come in rapidly?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. They did come in rapidly.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When you came back in did you see Mrs. Reid?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; I don't believe there was a soul in the office when\r\nI came back in right then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see anybody else go in through there?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; after I answered the telephone then there was about\r\nfour or five people that came in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anybody in that room when you came back in and went\r\nto the telephone?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Mrs. Reid come back in?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; I think I felt sure that I did. I thought that\r\nthere were five or six that came in together. I thought she was one of\r\nthose.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Reid told us she came in alone and when she came in she\r\ndidn't see anybody there.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Well, it could be that she did, sir. I was talking on the\r\nphones and then came the policemen and then came the press. Everybody\r\nwas wanting an outside line and then our vice president came in and he\r\nsaid \"The next one that was clear, I have to have it\" and so I was busy\r\nwith the phone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. From the time you walked into the room you became immediately\r\nbusy with the phone?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir; sure was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see Oswald come in?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. My back would have been to the door he was supposed to have\r\ncome in at.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you facing the door he is supposed to have left by?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you recall seeing him?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you have any definite recollection of Mrs. Reid coming in?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. No, sir; I only saw four or five people that came by and\r\nthey all came and were all talking about how terrible it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember their names?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who were they?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Mr. Williams, Mr. Molina (spelling), Miss Martha Reid, Mrs.\r\nReid, Mrs. Sarah Stanton, and Mr. Campbell; that's all I recall, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Miss Hine, this will be written up and it will be submitted\r\nfor your signature if you wish, or you can waive signature right now;\r\nwhich do you prefer? Do you have any choice?\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Well, I would prefer to see it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Prefer to see it, all right, then this young lady will inform\r\nyou to come down, read it, look it over and sign it.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thanks very much for coming in.\r\n\r\nMiss HINE. You are very welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MISS DORIS BURNS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Miss Doris Burns was taken at 3:20 p.m., on April 7,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Please stand up and hold up your right hand and be sworn.\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. (complying).\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give will be the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your name, please?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Doris Burns.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your address?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. 2617 Shelby, Dallas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your occupation?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I am a correspondent for the Macmillan Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is your office?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. In the Texas School Book Depository Building on the third\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me something about yourself, where you were born\r\nand what your education is, and what your business occupation has been.\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Well, I was born in Tyler, Tex., and I graduated from high\r\nschool here in Dallas and I worked many years for lawyers here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Well, I was just a legal secretary and worked for Vanette\r\nHosiery Mills, secretary to the president. They are not here any more,\r\nI don't think. After that I worked for a geologist.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Most of your work has been secretarial, has it?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes, but at Macmillan I mostly compose my own letters.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you go to work for Macmillan?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. April 19, 1955. Am I too fast?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She can write as fast as you talk.\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. That's wonderful.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Go right ahead.\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Let's see, I've forgotten what else you wanted to know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, first of all, you went to work in 1955?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is the office of the Macmillan Co.?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Well, at that time it was on Ross and Akard; now----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was it in November 1963?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. At Elm and Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What part of the building?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. On the third floor, room 301.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are there any windows in those offices?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes; they have some windows; they face the west, I guess\r\nyou would say. They don't overlook the route of the President's----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do they or do they not overlook Elm Street?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. They do not overlook Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They overlook the railroad yards, do they?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On November 22d, what were you doing that day?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I was listening to the radio as I worked.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About noon, did you go to lunch?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Well, I had lunch at the office and then I didn't intend\r\nto go see the President, didn't have any desire to but I left about--I\r\ndon't remember the exact time but, anyway, when I left they said on the\r\nradio that he--that the motorcade was coming up, I believe it was Cedar\r\nSprings; anyway, he hadn't been away from the airport long and that\r\nhe was going about 5 miles an hour so everybody could see him. Well,\r\nthinking he was going that slowly, I thought I had plenty of time, so I\r\nwalked up to Sanger's.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To where?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Sanger's.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where is that?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. It's about four blocks up Elm Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which way on Elm--east?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. East; you see, we are down at the extreme west end of the\r\nstreet; nothing else down there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I bought some Kleenex and came back, and everybody was out\r\non the steps to look, but I didn't stop. I went on back to the office.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the third floor?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was anybody in the office?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes; Mrs. Case hadn't ever gone out. She was there. I\r\nbelieve she was the only one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I listened to the radio, and by that time they said that\r\nhe was on Main and turning at Houston or Main by the courthouse, so\r\nsince he was that close, I thought, well, I guess I will go look out\r\nthe window. I didn't care enough to go downstairs, but I thought I will\r\ngo look out the window. So I thought I would have plenty of time, if\r\nhe was just coming around Main Street, that I could still get around\r\nthere, so I went around to American Book Co., which is the office\r\nclosest to us that had a window looking out on Elm. There was nobody in\r\nthere, so then I started down the hall to Allyn and Bacon. As I went\r\ndown this hall towards the windows that looked out on Houston Street,\r\nI heard a shot, but I didn't think much about it. I didn't, of course,\r\nknow it was a shot because when you hear tires backfire and all, they\r\nall sound alike to me, so I didn't think a thing about that.\r\n\r\nI went around to Allyn and Bacon, and Mr. Wilson, the manager, was at\r\nthe window looking out. He was the only one in there, so I asked him\r\nif I could look out the window with him. About that time he said \"Oh,\r\nmy God, there's been a shooting.\" I still didn't think anybody, of\r\ncourse, had been killed, just thought somebody had shot in the air or\r\nsomething, so I said \"Has the President already passed? And he said\r\n\"Yes,\" so I looked out and that big bus that had the press in it, had\r\nthe word \"Press\" or whatever it was on the bus, was passing, so I said\r\n\"Well, I guess I have missed the President then,\" and I started on back\r\nout of the office and I just said as I left, \"Well, I hope nobody got\r\nhurt.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You heard how many shots?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. One.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just one?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. It must have been the last one because I didn't hear any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have any idea where it was coming from?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Well, it just sounded as though it was back of me. You see,\r\nI was going towards Houston Street. I was facing east and it sounded to\r\nme as if it came toward my back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were in the building?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes; I was in the building.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Walking down the hall?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Walking down the hall going towards Allyn and Bacon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what happened after that?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I came on back and listened to the radio some more and in a\r\nfew minutes, why, they told it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever know Lee Harvey Oswald?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I rode on the elevator with him one time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. But I didn't know who he was--about a week before.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never talked to him?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I never talked to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who were you with at the time this happened?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. The Macmillan Co.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who was in the office with you?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Mrs. Case, but I couldn't see her.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. She was in the same office?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I have a private office. She was around the corner where\r\nher office is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Case?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you hear anybody running down the stairs at any time?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. Yes, but I didn't know----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. It was after that; I went to the restroom.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long after?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I imagine maybe it was 25 minutes. I imagine it was the\r\npoliceman or somebody; of course, I don't know who it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I think that's all, Miss Burns. This will be written up and\r\nyou can sign it; you can read it and sign it or you can waive your\r\nsignature if you wish and you won't have to come back here. Which would\r\nyou rather do?\r\n\r\nMiss BURNS. I can waive signature if that is all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Fine, thank you very much, Miss Burns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MARY E. BLEDSOE\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mary E. Bledsoe was taken at 9:30 a.m., on April 2,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball,\r\nDavid W. Belin, and Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the\r\nPresident's Commission. Mrs. Mary E. Bledsoe was accompanied by her\r\nattorney, Miss Melody June Douthit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you\r\nare about to give before this Commission will be the truth, the whole\r\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I do.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. State your name, please.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Mary E. Bledsoe.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And your residence?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. 621 North Marsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Bledsoe, you received a letter from the counsel for the\r\nCommission asking you to be here today, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you received that what date? March 26, or was it March 27?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. When? This first time?\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. No, back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I mean the letter your attorney just showed me. Seventeenth\r\nof March?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you have come down here in response to that letter,\r\nhaven't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are here appearing with your attorney, who is present\r\nat this time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You've been asked to give testimony in this matter which\r\nconcerns an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy,\r\nand certain facts which you have, which I believe that you knew of, and\r\nwe are going to ask you questions about it. That is the general subject\r\nof the investigation.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are willing to testify, are you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And give us as much help as you can?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is your--you have given us your address, haven't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me something, briefly, about your past life?\r\nWhere you were born and what your education was and what your\r\noccupation has been?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I was born in the country. Town of about 12 miles from\r\nCorsicanna, Tex. My father was a doctor down there, and I was a second\r\nchild; I have a brother older than I am. And then I moved to Ennis,\r\nand then come to Dallas and lived here until I was a little girl, 4 or\r\n5 years old, then I went back down to Ennis and my father practiced\r\nmedicine in Ennis, Tex., and then about--I married then when I was 17,\r\nand then I moved around quite a little while I was married, but--and\r\nthen my husband and I, we had trouble, and I divorced him in--oh, about\r\nin 1925, and I raised my two children by myself, and I have been in the\r\nplace where I live 24 years, and over on the back, I was--I have been\r\nhere 43 years in the neighborhood, and I raised both of my boys, and\r\nthey are grown.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your occupation has been that of a housewife?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes. Well, I had rented rooms, but I had some money my\r\nfather had given me. I had some money from him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your present address, you rent rooms, do you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I do, now. I have just started in September again.\r\nMy son left home, you see, and I started----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was September of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How large a house is that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it is all on one floor. And I have four bedrooms,\r\nbut I rent three.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In September of 1963, you were living there alone, were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; my son was living there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he left?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you rent rooms before your son left your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, let's see, now, oh, yes; uh-huh, in September I----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Except his bedroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he left you rented another bedroom, did you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well yes; I am trying to. Haven't got it rented.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you ever rent a room in your home to Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me about the first time that you ever saw him.\r\nWhat the date was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. The first time I ever saw him or heard of him, I was in\r\nthe backyard doing a lot of yardwork. I come around the house and he\r\nwas standing on the porch, and he said, \"Do you have a room for rent?\"\r\n\r\nI had a \"for rent\" sign out. I said, \"Yes\" and he said, \"May I see it?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I wanted--\"Yes\"; and then I was trying to size him up to get in\r\nthat room, and--in the house, and I said, \"Are you married?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Yes; I am married. I just want this for a short time. My\r\nwife lives at Irving.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then we got inside the house and he had a thing where\r\nthis--pictures of his wife and baby, and he said he was in the Marine\r\nCorps, and I tried to be nice to him, and so, he paid me $7, and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then did he tell you what his name was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. His name was Oswald, and he put it on this thing, and my\r\nson took it and sold it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said he put it on this thing?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. This right here.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is, \"this thing\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Mary, why don't you pull up your chair and be comfortable\r\nwhile you are doing this. Now, you are all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you have a calendar here?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That is my calendar.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is the calendar for December 1963, and I notice it has\r\ndates and names and dates. Is that the way you keep books on your rooms?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; but I don't now. I did then, because I just had\r\nstarted. The first one I got was in September.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. September of 1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He put his name on the calendar?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, got it in September. He got it, my son sold it for\r\n$5, and I didn't even know that he tore that out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, let me see here in this calendar. It runs from January\r\n1963, to December of 1963, but October of 1963, has been torn out?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh. And he said his name was Lee Oswald was what his\r\nname was, and I said, \"Well, I can't think of that name Oswald, I will\r\ncall you Lee.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he put it down on the 4th. Just rented for a week, you see, the 7th.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You said the 4th?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On the 7th.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 7th of October? That is the first day you ever saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Ever saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 7th of October you rented the room to him, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And is that the date that he put his name on the calendar?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; that is the day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He paid you $7?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. $7 in money.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the rental?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. For one room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. For one room for 1 week?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did he move into the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Right then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have his things?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Had his things on his hand and had his bag, but after he\r\npaid my $7 he went out--I don't know, I think this YMCA, but I am not\r\nsupposed to know where, and brought back another bag, and then he said,\r\n\"Well, where is the grocery store?\"\r\n\r\nWell, I said, \"It is down that way,\" but I didn't want him to use the\r\nkitchen, so, he said, \"I'm going to get some milk,\" and so, I didn't\r\nlike that much, but I didn't say anything about it because I wanted to\r\nget along with him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me ask you some questions before we commence the grocery\r\nstore part of it.\r\n\r\nWhen you first saw him, did he have his luggage with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he have with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. A bag.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you describe the bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't remember where--seemed like it was a kind of a\r\nduffelbag.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The kind the men in the service put their clothes in?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; and had some on his arm, these coathangers, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had some things on a coathanger?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And had a clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. A clock, wrapped up.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What color was this duffelbag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I think it was blue.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the only bag he had with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, he went off to town and got another one.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then he went off to town and brought another bag back, would\r\nyou describe that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, I didn't pay any attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it leather or----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Could you give me any idea of the size of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it was big. About like that [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About like that, you mean, oh, 3 feet long, 2 feet, 2-1/2?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; about like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. As well as I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About 2 feet long? Was it brown?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I just couldn't remember. I didn't pay any attention to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember the color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember him carrying it into the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I remember he went in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. But, I didn't pay any attention. He rented the room, and\r\nI didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he carry it by a handle, or in his arms?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I guess he carried it by a handle, but I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He brought two bags into this room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; wasn't but one when he come in, but next time he\r\nwent off----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He brought another one back?\r\n\r\nHow did he come out there, do you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know. I don't know whether he come here--he come\r\nand just knocked on the door. I was in the backyard.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After he moved, after he put his bags in his room, did he\r\nleave?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he said----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I mean, did he leave to go downtown to get the other bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh, and come back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him leave?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The time he went to get the other bag, did you see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know what kind of transportation he had?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I guess I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see him drive up in a car?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, always took a bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I saw--one time he stopped over there across the\r\nstreet and get the bus that is the only time I didn't--I didn't watch\r\nwhat he did. Of course, I had no idea he was the kind of man he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say that he asked you where the grocery store was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that when he came back with this second bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; uh-huh, I got him something to eat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to him anything about his using your\r\nrefrigerator?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. One question. Ask her how long he was gone and you will\r\nknow how far he went. That is what I wanted to know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he left to get this second bag, how long was he gone?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, not over an hour. About an hour. It wasn't a\r\nlong--I wondered then where he went, but it wasn't none of my business.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say now not over an hour. Do you think it might have been\r\nless than an hour?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I believe less than an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How much less?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I'd say 40 minutes, anyway, at most.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This was in the afternoon, was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; started at 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At 3 o'clock he came to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then he came back the second time with the second bag\r\nbefore 4, did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I'm sure he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you talk to him any about the use of the refrigerator?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, he said he was going to put something in there, and\r\nI said--I didn't have anything to say, and I hemmed-and-hawed, I said,\r\n\"Well, no; I don't have a very big refrigerator.\"\r\n\r\nWell, he said, \"I won't use it after this time.\" He was very, very\r\ncongenial.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go down to the grocery store?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he buy?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He bought some peanut butter and some sardines, and some\r\nbananas and put it all in his room, except the milk, and he ate there,\r\nate in his room. I didn't like that either.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was there how many days?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He was there 5 days, just 5 days.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was there--what day of the week was the day that he came?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Monday and Tuesday he stayed home and went to bed, and\r\nstayed--I didn't pay any attention to him----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Monday night he stayed home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; after he went to the grocery store.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about Tuesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Tuesday he went out at 9:30 and come home at 2:30. He was\r\nlooking for a job, and called on the phone, wanted different ones, and\r\nI got the book, and papers, and tried to look for him a job, because he\r\nwas a nice looking boy, and wanted a job.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, he went out at 9-9:30 in the morning and came back at\r\n2:30?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Let's see. 1:30. I have my nap then, and it kind of\r\ninterfered, but I didn't say anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say you have a what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I have a nap then.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You take a nap in the afternoon?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I had a stroke, you see.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And it interfered with your nap when he came back?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; but I didn't say anything then, but then the next\r\nday----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let's finish Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. All right. That's all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go out again after he came home at 1:30?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Stayed in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. All the time, and stayed there that night, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All the time? What about Wednesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He left about 9 o'clock, and went off dressed. Had a\r\nwhite shirt and white tie and white--white trousers, and looked very\r\nnice. Went off Monday about 2 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Wednesday. Then he got back at 1:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me see, he left at 9?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Come back at 1:30?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did he go out again that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; but then he talked to somebody on the phone, and\r\ntalked in a foreign language.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean when? Wednesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On Wednesday, I guess it was Wednesday, but I am sure\r\nit must have been Wednesday. I was in my room, and the telephone is\r\nover there [indicating], and I didn't like that, somebody talking in a\r\nforeign language and, so I told my girl friend, I said, \"I don't like\r\nanybody talking in a foreign language.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time of day did he call on the phone and talk in a\r\nforeign language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He come home at 1:30 and talked about 2 or 2:30, talked\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go out again that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; went to bed.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Went to bed that night and stayed there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And I didn't fix his room either, that is why I didn't\r\nsee his luggage. I didn't go in his room at all because they take care\r\nof their own rooms.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about Thursday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Thursday, he went out at 10 o'clock or 10:30, and I was\r\nout in the yard, and he come out and I said, \"Oh. I thought you had\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, he didn't go, but he came home a little bit early,\r\nand after I said he got into my nap, he come home at 2 o'clock, or\r\n2:30, you see, and didn't leave until 10.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you tell him that he interfered with your nap?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What day did you tell him that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I told him that, I guess must have been Thursday.\r\nThursday and then he----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean Thursday morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, then Thursday morning is when he left a little later\r\nthan usual?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you told him that he had interfered with your nap before\r\nthat day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I think it was--it must have been--no; it was that\r\nday. It was after I had that call. I didn't like that and he never said\r\na word, and then I interviewed him when he first came in and thought he\r\nwas all right, and he never spoke--I had one boy on the back. He never\r\nsaw him and he would run to the bathroom and go to the icebox and get\r\nsome ice, and didn't like that. Went too much to the icebox, but----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, now----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That was a Thursday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he went away on Thursday, then had you told him prior to\r\nthat time that when he came in at 1:30, in the afternoon, he interfered\r\nwith your nap?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you think you might have told him that on Wednesday or\r\nTuesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't tell him until after I had that call.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When was the call?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And who called you on Wednesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He called somebody, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean the day that he called someone and spoke in a\r\nforeign language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After that, you told him----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That he interfered with your nap?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh. I didn't like it, and the next day he fussed with\r\nsomebody on the phone, I don't know whether it was his wife or who it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was Thursday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About what time of day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. About 2 o'clock or 2:30 when he come home here and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go out again that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Stayed in all day?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Stayed in all day, and it was Friday he stayed in his\r\nroom all day. Didn't eat. Ate what he had in his room. Stayed in his\r\nroom all day long.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you next see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Been--then Saturday, he started out and had his bag.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Started out with his luggage?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Saturday morning he started out with his bag and----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which bag did he take?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it the duffelbag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Like you see the servicemen carrying?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I guess it was. I didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This was Saturday morning about what time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. About 10 o'clock, or 9:30 and I thought he was going to\r\nmove and I--\"Oh--\" I said, \"You are going to move?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"No; I am just going for the weekend.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I said, \"Well, I don't know.\" But he said, \"And I want my room\r\ncleaned and clean sheets put on the bed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Well, I will after you move because you are going to move.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nI says, \"Because I am not going to rent to you any more.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Not going to what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Not going to rent to you any more, He said, \"Give me back\r\nmy money.\" Now, $2.\r\n\r\nI said, \"Well, I don't have it.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he left Saturday morning and, in the meantime. I think his wife was\r\ngoing to have a baby----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you know that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I found--I read it in the papers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he ever tell you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, no; he didn't ever tell me. Didn't tell me anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You told him you weren't going to rent to him any more on\r\nthat Saturday morning about 10 o'clock. At that time did he have his\r\nbag? Was he carrying a bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; going out with it again. Going out to Irving.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How did you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, said he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He told you he was going to Irving?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; said he was going to Irving.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he tell you he was going to Irving for any purpose?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; just said he was going to Irving. No; he didn't tell\r\nme anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why did you tell him you wouldn't rent to him any more?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Because I didn't like him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't like his attitude. He was just kind of like\r\nthis, you know, just big shot, you know, and I didn't have anything to\r\nsay to him, and--but, I didn't like him. There was just something about\r\nhim I didn't like or want him--just wasn't the kind of person I wanted.\r\nJust didn't want him around me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he left on Saturday morning do you know by what\r\ntransportation he took?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is there a bus stop near your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Right in front of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him take the bus.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him wait for the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I just saw him go out the door. Didn't pay any\r\nattention. And when he left I said--oh, he was going to come back\r\nand get his things Saturday. He took it out and said, \"Well, it is 2\r\ndollars,\" and I--\"Well, I don't have it, so, he went off.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, wait a minute. Did he say he would come back and get\r\nthe things Saturday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he didn't say a thing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, wait a minute. Saturday morning you told him you\r\nwouldn't rent to him again. What did he say about getting his money\r\nback?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, he said, \"Well, give me my money back and I will\r\nmove now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I don't have it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Didn't say anything and went on out the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there anything said about whether he would come to get\r\nhis clothes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; not a thing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he come back Saturday night?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did he come back?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Monday morning.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And from Saturday morning until Monday morning you didn't see\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time Monday morning did he come back?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Between 8 and 9, 9 and 10. I mean.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came back did he have anything with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have his bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; didn't say a word to him. He--I didn't say a word to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came back did he have anything in his hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you see him leave?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he take with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He had that bag.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. The bag, you see, he had two.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. But, I never noticed it. I don't know what kind it was or\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he left, he had one bag when he left?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. One bag.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know whether it was the duffelbag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I couldn't say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember what color it was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; just navy blue. I don't know which one he carried, or\r\nwhat they were or what. I didn't pay any attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't know whether both bags were navy blue, or different\r\ncolors?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You know one was navy blue?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he left, did he say anything to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or did you say anything to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No. I said, \"Good luck.\" You know, I thought to myself,\r\n\"That's good riddance,\" and I looked in his room and it was all right,\r\nand nothing was disturbed.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had he cleaned it up?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it was dirty.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he leave anything around the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; somehow I saw a map. I believe he left that map.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What map?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. A map of Dallas where he could get around to get some\r\nplaces, jobs.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do with that map?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Throwed it in the garbage.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Threw it away?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it a map, kind of a map put out by the service stations?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; one of those kinds. I just threw it away and cleaned\r\nup the room. Just threw it away.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did the map have any markings on it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You know--do you know what the markings were?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; didn't pay any attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did you ever see him again?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I thought. \"Well, he is gone,\" and forgot it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But, before you go into that, I notice you have been reading\r\nfrom some notes before you.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, because I forget what I have to say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you make those notes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. What day did I make them?\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. When Mr. Sorrels and I were talking about her going to\r\nWashington, he made the suggestion that she put all the things down\r\non paper because she might forget something, and I said, \"Mary, you\r\nput everything on a piece of paper so that you can remember it and you\r\nwon't forget anything, you know, what happened,\" and that's when she\r\nstarted making notes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You have made the notes in the last week?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. At my suggestion and Mr. Sorrels.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't make any notes during the week he was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Your address, make sure that we have this. The address where\r\nyou were living on the 7th of October was 621 Marsalis--North Marsalis,\r\nDallas, Tex.?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That's right. Marsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are still living there, aren't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the foreign language that you heard Oswald using over the\r\ntelephone on this Wednesday afternoon, do you know what the language\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are you familiar with the Spanish language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I am not. Not familiar with any of them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All you know it was not English?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But, you can't tell what language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you make a guess?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I have no idea. I do, because the girl is Spanish,\r\nbut I don't know whether he called her or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What girl is Spanish?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I mean--his wife was Russian.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Russian.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, when did you see Oswald again?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I went down to the parade. Oh, when was the parade?\r\nThe 22d of--the next--22d of February--when was the parade?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The 22d of November the President came to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And I first got off at Neiman's and I--the parade didn't\r\ncome on, and I kept walking on up, and walked in front of Titche's\r\nover on that side there, and I saw the parade there. He passed--I saw\r\nthe President, oh, I was happy I got to see him. And--so then I got on\r\nacross and went over to the Athletic Club, and caught the bus.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What bus did you catch?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I don't remember whether it was the Marsalis or the\r\nRomana.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Both go by your house, do they? What was the last one?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. The Marsalis.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What was the second name?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Romana.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And both go west on Elm?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Right--so, I got on the bus, and while it was awfully\r\ncrowded there----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean crowded on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there many people on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How many people on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, about 10.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what was the location on Elm where you boarded this bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. At the Athletic Club.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What cross street is that, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. St. Paul.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. St. Paul? You got on at St. Paul? St. Paul and Elm?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the bus was going in what direction?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. West.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, now, tell me what happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy--I figured it\r\nout. Let's see. I don't know for sure. Oswald got on. He looks like a\r\nmaniac. His sleeve was out here [indicating]. His shirt was undone.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are indicating a sleeve of a shirt?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was unraveled?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Was a hole in it, hole, and he was dirty, and I didn't\r\nlook at him. I didn't want to know I even seen him, and I just looked\r\noff, and then about that time the motorman said the President had been\r\nshot, and I sit--when I go to town I sit this way on the bus. The\r\nmotorman is right there [indicating], and I sit right there so that I\r\ncan get off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean--where do you sit with reference to the motorman,\r\none seat or two seats behind him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't--the motorman is here, and I sit across in the\r\nseat across the way.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on this day when you boarded the bus, is that the seat\r\nyou took?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I always did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would that be the first seat on the right-hand side?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First seat on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Side seat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oh, it is a side seat? Was that side seat so that you were\r\nfacing the motorman?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When Oswald got on, you then weren't facing him, were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; but I saw that it was him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How close did he pass to you as he boarded the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Just in front of me. Just like this [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just a matter of a foot or two?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he got on the bus, did he say anything to the motorman?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, the motorman? I think--I don't know. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where did he sit?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He sat about halfway back down.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On what side?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On the same side I was on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Same side? Did you look at him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he look at you as he went by? Did he look at you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know. I didn't look at him. That is--I was\r\njust--he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so distorted.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have a hat on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what color shirt did he have on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He had a brown shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And unraveled?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Hole in his sleeve right here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which is the elbow of the sleeve? That is, you pointed to the\r\nelbow?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it is.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And that would be which elbow, right or left elbow?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have anything on. Was the shirt open or was it\r\nbuttoned?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; all the buttons torn off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he have on underneath that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know the color of any undershirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Notice the color of his pants?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, they were gray, and they were all ragged in here\r\n[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Around where?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. At the seam.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At the waist?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. At the waist, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was the shirt tucked beneath the belt in his pants, or\r\noutside the belt?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he had it in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had it tucked in?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it was tucked in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. So, that the belt of the pants was outside the shirt?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you say the motorman said something?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Motorman said, \"Well, the President has been shot,\" and\r\nI say--so, and the woman over--we all got to talking about four of us\r\nsitting around talking, and Oswald was sitting back there, and one of\r\nthem said, \"Hope they don't shoot us,\" and I said, \"I don't believe\r\nthat--it is--I don't believe it. Somebody just said that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was too crowded, you see, and Oswald had got off.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far had he been on the bus before he got off? Until the\r\ntime he got on until the time he got off?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. About three or four blocks.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say anything to the motorman when he got off?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. They say he did, but I don't remember him saying anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever see the motorman give him a transfer?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't pay any attention but I believe he did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, what do you mean he--you believe he did? Did you\r\nremember seeing him get on or are you telling me something you read in\r\nthe newspapers?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't remember. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you pay any attention at that time as to whether he did,\r\nor did not get a transfer?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, did you look at him as he got off the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I sure didn't. I didn't want to know him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you think you got enough of a glimpse of him to be able\r\nto recognize him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think you might be mistaken?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't look very carefully, did you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I just glanced at him, and then looked the other way\r\nand I hoped he didn't see me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, are there two exits from the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The middle of the bus, and front of the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which exit did he leave?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Front.\r\n\r\nMrs. BALL. By the motorman?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh, by the motorman.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody else get off at that time when he got off?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, not then, but there was a lady sitting right across,\r\nshe wanted to go to the train station.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. To the what station?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Train station, and she was worried about trying to get\r\noff, you know, trying to get there, and then we were hearing her,\r\nand I said, \"Well, why don't you walk over there. It's just a little\r\nways.\" Because the crowd was so bad we still didn't know the President\r\nhad been killed, and finally she got off, but I think it was--it was\r\nbefore--I mean after Oswald did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did she ask for a transfer?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; she had the man give her one, because she caught the\r\nbus before she got to the train station.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I saw her.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You saw her catch another bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. She got on when we did. She rode a block.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did anybody get off when the lady got off? Anybody that was\r\ngoing to the train station?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there traffic? Was the traffic heavy?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, it was awful in the city, and then they had roped off\r\nthat around where the President was killed, shot, and we were the first\r\ncar that come around there, and then all of us were talking about the\r\nman, and we were looking up to see where he was shot and looking--and\r\nthen they had one man and taking him, already got him in jail, and we\r\ngot--\"Well, I am glad they found him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were looking up at where?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. At where the boy was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean the Texas Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. School Book Depository?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh, because we were right four blocks from there, you\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me the location of the bus with reference to a\r\ncross street on Elm where Oswald got off?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I can't, because they have changed that street, so,\r\nthey have torn down things and I don't go to town very much now and so\r\nI don't----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was it in the middle of the block, or at a regular bus stop?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, they said it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I want to know what you remember.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember whether it was a regular bus stop or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did Oswald get on at a regular bus stop?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any particular attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember anyone knocking on the door, and as a result,\r\nthe motorman opened the front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't remember that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are not able to say whether Oswald got on at a regular\r\nbus stop, or at a point between blocks?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you are not able to tell us whether he got off at regular\r\nbus stops, or between?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, had the bus gone as far as Lamar Street, when Oswald got\r\noff?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes. No; I think before we got to Lamar Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Close to Lamar?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, close.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How close?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I couldn't say.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Within a half block, or block?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; within a block.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. About a block from Lamar, you think?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was approaching Lamar, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you first notify the police that you believe you'd\r\nseen Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. When I got home, first thing I did I went next door\r\nand told them the President had been shot, and so she turned on the\r\nradio and I went in and called my son and said the President had\r\nbeen shot, and he said, \"Why, he has got killed.\" Well, I turned on\r\nthe radio--television--and we heard ambulances and going around and\r\nthem, and so, I didn't pay any attention. I wanted to hear about the\r\nPresident and there was a little boy came in that room in the back and\r\nhe turned it on, and we listened and hear about Mr. Tippen [sic] being\r\nshot, and it didn't dawn on me, and I said--told his name as Oswald.\r\nI don't--didn't mean anything to me, so, I wanted to hear about the\r\nPresident, only one I was interested in, so, he went on back to work\r\nand they kept talking about this boy Oswald and had on a brown shirt,\r\nand all of a sudden, well, I declare, I believe that this was this boy,\r\nand his name was Oswald--that is--give me his right name, you know, and\r\nso, about an hour my son came home, and I told him, and he immediately\r\ncalled the police and told them, because we wanted to do all we could,\r\nand so, I went down the next night. He took me down, and I made a\r\nstatement to them, what kind of--Secret Service man or something down\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. At the police station.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Uh-huh. Now, did you ever see Oswald in a lineup?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they ever show you pictures?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; showed me pictures of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But didn't show you Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Never did see Oswald after he was arrested?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Not after he got off the bus; no.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But, you looked at the pictures of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Showed you the pictures of Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. The man down at the police station, he had a picture of\r\nhim with a gun, and said, \"Do you recognize him?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Yes; it is Oswald.\" That is the one that I remember him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you know the name of the man who showed you the picture of\r\nthe man with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I am so bad about names.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there one man or more than one man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, about a dozen.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oh, a dozen men?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. There sure was a lot of them. Two Secret Service men, and\r\ntwo to do this, and oh, I had interviewed about 9 or 10 or 12, plenty\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, I have got a piece of clothing here, which is marked----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Commission Exhibit 150.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This is a shirt----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That is it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What do you mean by \"that is it?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Because they brought it out to the house and showed it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I know. What do you mean by \"this is it?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, because I can recognize it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Recognize it as what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, sir; see there?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes. You tell me what do you see here? What permits you to\r\nrecognize it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I recognize--first thing I notice the elbow is out and\r\nthen I saw--when the man brought it out and let me see it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No, I am talking about--I am showing you this shirt now, and\r\nyou said, \"That is it.\" You mean--What do you mean by \"that is it\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That is the one he had out there that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who had it out there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Some Secret Service man.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He brought it out. Now, I am--you have seen this shirt then\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was brought out by the Secret Service man and shown to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen the shirt before that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he had it on, though.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who had it on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oswald had it on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oswald had it on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, what is there about the shirt that makes you believe\r\nthat this is the shirt that Oswald had on when he was on the bus? What\r\nis there about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, let's see the front of it. Yes. See all this\r\n[indicating]? I remember that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me what you see there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I saw the--no; not so much that. It was done after--that\r\nis the part I recognize more than anything.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are pointing to a hole in the right elbow?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about the color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I--What do you mean?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. When he had it on?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Before he was shot? Yes; I remember it being brown.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You remember the shirt being brown.\r\n\r\nWas it this color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; it was that color.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In other words, when you remember that you have seen\r\nsomething before----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. In order to convince me that you did see it before you've got\r\nto tell me what there is about it that is the same, you see. Now, you\r\ntry to convince me, or tell me why it is that you believe that this is\r\nthe shirt that Oswald had on when you saw him on the bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I would say it was. That hole----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mostly the hole in the right sleeve?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What about the color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I remember the color.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is a similar color, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; same color.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Same color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think that is the shirt?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; it is the shirt.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen him wear this shirt before, when he was\r\naround your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. First time you ever saw the shirt was when you saw him on the\r\nbus?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have two exhibits here. One Commission Exhibit 157. Exhibit\r\n157, and Commission 156, both pants. Have you ever seen either one of\r\nthose before?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Now, is that long pants?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes; this is 157.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, that is not the ones he had on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That is not?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it was ragged up at the top.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. This other pair of pants, 156, does that look like any of the\r\npants he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That must have been it, but seemed like it was ragged up\r\nat the top.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But, you think 156 may have been the pair of pants he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You think 157--don't pay any attention to the fact that it is\r\ncut up--does 157 look anything like the pants he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't think so?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I have no more questions to ask you now, Mrs. Bledsoe, but\r\nMr. Jenner will ask you some questions.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I will get up here close so you will hear me all right.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I would like to go back to the day that he came to your\r\nhome on the 7th of October?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You were out in your backyard?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And did he come back there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have a bell on your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He knocked at the door and you heard him knock at the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And I went around the front.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your home is all at one level?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So, you walked through your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I went through the yard and come around from the back\r\nto the front yard.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you saw a young man at the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How was that young man dressed on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't remember what he had on. Didn't pay any\r\nattention. He was clean and that's all you see, but I didn't know what\r\ncolor the pants were and what kind of shirt it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, did he have a suit on or sportscoat, or just his\r\nshirt?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Just the shirt. It was hot weather. October.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you recall--did he have a tie on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The shirt, that was open at the front?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes, it wasn't those short shirts. I don't know what kind\r\nit was. I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And this was a Monday morning.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Monday afternoon. Did he have a hat on?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he--did he have any luggage?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; had one bag, I don't know whether it was a duffel or\r\nwhat, but then he went on and got another one.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, if you will permit me to stay with what he had when\r\nyou first saw him----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You call on your recollection and tell me all you can tell\r\nme about the bag he had at that time, its size, its shape. In another\r\nconnection, Mrs. Bledsoe, it is prior events that are important to us.\r\nIf we can possibly find out or get as accurate a description as you can\r\ngive us. Sit there relaxed and tell us what you remember about this\r\nbag, what size it was; what shape it was; whether it was hard; whether\r\nit was soft, what color it was.\r\n\r\nWas it zippered? How was it fastened?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know whether it was zippered or not. But seems to\r\nme like it was, though.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just start from the beginning and tell us what you remember\r\nabout the bag that he had when you first saw him at the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it was just a blue--like a canvas bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Canvas?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And, I don't know whether it was zippered or not.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't recall a zippered sort of bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't even look. It was about that long, I guess\r\n[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You are indicating about 26 inches?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About that long.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Then, he had some things on his back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you mind if we stuck with the bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, it was 26 inches long and you think it was canvas,\r\nand you think it was blue in color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What was its shape? Was it a round sort of soft kind of bag\r\nor was it--did it have firm, stiff sides? Was it rectangular?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I couldn't say. Couldn't say. Didn't pay any\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your recollection does serve you that it was not what we\r\nwould call a suitcase?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; looked like an inexpensive bag of some kind.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your memory doesn't serve you that there was any sort\r\nof zipper thing, and you do seem to have a reasonably firm recollection\r\nthat the color of it was blue?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did it have a handle on it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When he picked it up----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, that is----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I was trying to get an idea, and well--I have a coat here,\r\nand using it for purposes of illustration, when he picked up the bag by\r\nthe handles did the bag sag, or was it firm?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any attention. Didn't pay a bit of attention.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, I notice from your testimony that he also had, on this\r\noccasion, at this time, in addition to the canvas bag, blue in color,\r\nhe had some things over his arm, or over his shoulder?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On a coathanger.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He had some articles of clothing?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On coathangers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On coathangers?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And were those draped back over the shoulder or arm, or was\r\nhe holding them by the hooks or hooks on the hangers?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I think he had them on coathangers, just--I guess--I\r\ndon't know--he was standing there. I don't have no idea.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just how he was carrying them, you are uncertain, but you\r\nare certain that he had articles of clothing on hangers?\r\n\r\nMr. BLEDSOE. On coathangers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were--would they be wooden coathangers or the metal?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Metal ones.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. The type you get when you send clothes to the cleaners and\r\nthey come back on these wire, metal hangers, what--was that the type?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I imagine. I couldn't tell. Now, I--no; I didn't\r\npay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your recollection serves you now that there were hangers,\r\nbut you cannot recall whether they were the wire type or whether they\r\nwere wooden?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. When he left, he just carried them off. I never did look\r\nat his clothes at all.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You impress me as a lady that wouldn't be fussing around?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't care enough about it. All I wanted him to do was\r\nrent the room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, you had a discussion, and you rented the room to him\r\nfor $7 for that week?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he paid you then and there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In cash?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; and I gave him a receipt on this book.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, he then left your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say anything about why he was leaving?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He went to the grocery store. No, no; first he went to\r\nget his other bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say then?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Didn't say anything.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you come to know that he went to get another bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He didn't say--he just went off.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He just turned around without any leave taking?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; because he was not a man to talk, you know, what\r\nI got out of him, I had to get it out of him, because it was hard\r\nto--because I wanted to see what kind of a person he was, and it was\r\nhard to get, you know, to judge him in such a short time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you completed the transaction about his renting the\r\nroom and you got your $7, he paid it to you, so it was agreed he had\r\nthe room for a week, did he go in and look at the room before he paid\r\nyou the $7?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He was in the room, and I was at the door, and he looked\r\nat it and I said, $7, so, he took it and give me the money all in ones,\r\n$7.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Seven $1 bills?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Seven $1 bills, and then he come over to my room and\r\nI--he wrote it down, and it is a good thing I had him write it, because\r\nI am kind of nervous, and I don't write so well, see, and he put it\r\ndown on that, and that--and so, that is--this is in September, but\r\nanyway----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes; I appreciate that.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. October----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Let me ask her this question about that bag, if it was\r\npuffed out, or approximately what shape it was, also, as to any further\r\nconversation that she had as to his background, how much she knows. If\r\nyou are interested. You might not be.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Mr. Robert Davis of the attorney general's office of Texas\r\nhas come in, and I am not seeking to press you, but we have some\r\nproblems of the highest degree of exactitude that we can obtain. And at\r\nthe risk of boring you, I would like to go back to that bag again.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, that; I didn't pay much attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When you first saw him at the door at your front of your\r\nhome, he had the bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it resting on the porch, or was he standing before the\r\ndoor with bag in hand when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I come around the house, you see, and I don't know. I\r\ndidn't pay--I don't know, couldn't tell you whether he was carrying it\r\nor what, but he did have these things on his shoulder, on his hangers.\r\nIt--maybe had it sitting down, I don't know. I guess he did. I didn't\r\npay any attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And at that point you were asking why he was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he asked me if I had a room for rent.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And I said, \"Yes,\" and I thought, \"Well, are you\r\nmarried?\" And he said, \"Yes,\" and----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You asked?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You inquired of him as to his history?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did you inquire of him, and what did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I wanted to find out something about him, and he\r\nsaid, \"Well, I just want the room for a week or two, because I am going\r\nto get a job and then I will have my wife here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He told you at that time and informed you that he was\r\nunemployed?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he would be seeking work?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he said that he was going to bring his wife?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And--when and if he obtained employment?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And so, that give me a lead, something to talk about, and\r\nI said, \"Well, what kind of work do you do?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do electronics,\" he said, and I said, \"Well, there is some good\r\njobs because you are young, and you can get a good job a young man like\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then went on. Then something about him being in the Marines, and I\r\nsaid, \"Well, that is wonderful. My son was in the Navy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd talking about him, you know, just getting to know him, and--but,\r\n\"here is a picture of my wife, and picture of the girl, and the baby.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Oh, she has got a baby, hasn't she?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd everything he said, I had to pull it out of him to talk about\r\nsomething for him to say what it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But, he volunteered the picture of his wife and child?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; he did that. Showed me that picture.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was that an ordinary snapshot picture?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh. It was in his billfold.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Took it out of his billfold?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, sir; it was in the billfold. Just showed it in the\r\nbillfold.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. I have a billfold here. Was it this type?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it was something else. Don't seem like it was like\r\nthat. Seemed like it opened this other way, I----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. This?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I think it was like that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he carry it in his trouser pocket, coat pocket?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any attention where he had it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What other inquiries did you make of him to become better\r\nacquainted and find out about him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He said he had been in the Marines and I thought that was\r\na pretty good recommendation, and I said, \"Well, you won't have any\r\ntrouble at all getting any job.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, the next morning I was helping him looking for a job.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, pardon me, if you will just stick to while you're at\r\nthe door now.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Just one interruption, but find out if this conversation\r\ntook place at the door, or after he got in the room.\r\n\r\nThey are in this room, you see.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You went inside the house almost immediately?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When he first made an inquiry?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you took him to show him the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And your inquiries were--with respect to his history were\r\nin the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he showed you the picture while you were in the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I think so.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And I take it, am I correct, when you went into the room he\r\nhad that bag, and he had the articles of clothing?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And had them with him, didn't leave them on the porch?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he do with the bag when he entered the room? Did\r\nhe put it down on the floor?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Didn't pay any attention? What did he do with the articles\r\nof clothing on the hangers?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I wasn't paying any attention to it. I guess he hung them\r\nup. Just a young boy, and I was trying to see if he was clean, and if\r\nhe was very intelligent, and he was going to go to work, so, I didn't\r\nhave too much to work on. Told me he had a nice wife, so, I didn't have\r\nanything to say.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When your son was in the Navy, did he have a duffelbag?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No. Now, it was so long ago--it was--I don't know whether\r\nhe did. I don't think he did. He didn't. He was an instructor at TI.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he stationed here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, TI. Treasure Island.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oh, Treasure Island. How long did this discussion with him\r\nin the room take?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, I guess 10 minutes because those--he was--you know,\r\nold people, they want to get you out of the way. They don't want to\r\nlisten to you, but I wanted to find out, so, I think I maybe asked him\r\ntoo many questions, but I wanted him to say something to me and he said\r\nsomething about his--I said, \"Do you have a family here,\" and he said,\r\n\"Yes, my family lives here.\"\r\n\r\nWell, he wouldn't say his mother or anything, and I didn't ask him\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Well----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. All right.\r\n\r\n(Discussion off the record.)\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you notice anything in addition to the hangers with\r\nrespect to these clothes? Were the articles of clothing enclosed in any\r\nkind of a bag or paper, plastic, or otherwise?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, just on hangers.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just on hangers.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. But I didn't pay any attention to what kind of--I think\r\nmaybe a coat. I don't know what it was, a sweater or something.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you see how many articles of clothing were there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, about four.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And none of them was enclosed in any kind of a container,\r\nplastic or otherwise?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was he pleasant during all of the conversation you had with\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Was the first day. Next day didn't talk any more. I\r\ndidn't talk to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. As soon as he--recalling to mind that he paid you the $7.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did any further conversation take place after he paid you\r\nthe $7?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; that is when he asked where the grocery store was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. What else?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, he didn't say anything about going to get the rest\r\nof his things. I think that he must have been--said that after he came\r\nback with the other bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Must have said what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Where was the grocery store, after he come back and got\r\nthe other----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So, your recollection presently serves you that he paid you\r\nthe $7 and no further conversation took place?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He turned and left the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I--he was--I was in the room, I just walked out.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You walked out after the transaction, financially, was\r\ncomplete?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I went and he paid--he had already paid me but I wanted\r\nhim to put his name on here.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On your register?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. On this [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He did that----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. In your presence?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; in the living room.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your recollection was that he wrote the words \"Lee Oswald\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then did he leave your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Without saying anything to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he was gone--did he return?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; within about 40 minutes, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And he was gone about 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And got the rest of his things.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When he returned did you see him before he entered your\r\nhome?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you have a recollection of having seen him before he\r\nentered his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you become aware of the fact he had returned?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I must have heard him, or he might have come in and\r\nput his milk in the icebox.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, he didn't get the milk, as far as I recall, until\r\nyou'd advised him where the grocery store was.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was after he had returned from the----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. From the----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. After this 40-minute interval? I am just sticking for the\r\nmoment to the time that he returned to your home after 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He had put his name in your register and in your presence,\r\nin the living room, and turned and left your home and returned in 40\r\nminutes; now, is that right? It's that point that I am concentrating\r\non. When did you become aware that he had returned on that occasion and\r\nhow?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I don't know--I guess he come and put the things in\r\nthe icebox. I don't even remember where I was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see. So, that you didn't see him return to your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't see him come in.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Didn't see him come in?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you didn't know what he had with him at that point?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. To the best of your ability where was he in your home when\r\nyou became aware of his presence on his return after that 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I must have been in the kitchen and he came back there\r\nand put the milk in, I guess.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he have milk with him after he returned that 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, not the 40 minutes. That was the bag.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. See, this is what I'm trying to concentrate on for\r\nthe moment, before you get the milk. And I am trying to take it\r\nsequentially. He paid the $7 and signed the register in your living\r\nroom?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And without any further words to you he turned and left\r\nyour home, is that accurate?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; that's about right.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He returned in 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, sticking right to that point, when did you become\r\naware of the fact that he was then back in your home, that is, at that\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That he--he hadn't gotten the milk yet?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; this is when he first returned.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I don't know. I was just around the house. I didn't\r\npay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So, I take it, then, when he made that first trip back, you\r\ndidn't see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't know what he had with him on that occasion?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I guess he had the bag, didn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I want to stick with what you knew at that instant of time.\r\nWhat you found out afterwards, I'll go into that in a moment.\r\n\r\nYou didn't see him return?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You don't know what he had with him when he returned?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At that instance, because you didn't see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But, you were aware; now, you became aware of the fact that\r\nhe did return?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have a conversation with him at that point?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. When did you become aware and I gather from your earlier\r\ntestimony you became aware that he had brought that into your home, or\r\nthere was in your home some additional luggage. When you first saw him\r\nhe had this soft canvas bag, or canvas bag, whether it was soft or not\r\nthat is uncertain.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And then you became aware later that day that there was\r\nanother piece of luggage, and, am I correct about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Now, I think he said he was going to get some more. He\r\nwas going to get some more and he had some boots, too, in his hand.\r\nI--maybe he brought those the last time. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What kind of boots?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, they looked like they were about up to here\r\n[indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Up to the knee?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; about there [indicating].\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Oh,----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. There.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just a little above the ankle?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About 3 inches above the ankle?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know what they used them for.\r\n\r\nMrs. JENNER. Were they cowboy boots.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it wasn't cowboy boots.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Were they canvas, leather, or rubber?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; just leather.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Heavy-soled?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Heavy-soled.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Heavy-soled. Rubber soles?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, no; leather.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Any hobnails in them?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Hard heel or flat heel? I mean, flat sole and heel?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, they had a heel, too. I remember them having that. He\r\nmust have brought those in when he brought those the last time.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do not recall his having the boots at the time you\r\nfirst--at the first time you talked to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't believe he did.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But, you became aware of the boots afterward?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. At, or about, or after the time he returned from this\r\n40-minute absence?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And was it at the time you noticed the boots, did you also\r\nnotice that he had additional items of luggage?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, he went to get the luggage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he say that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't know whether he did or not. I know he--I\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you have a thought in mind when he left after he paid\r\nyou the $7 and signed your register that he was going somewhere to\r\nobtain additional articles of clothing?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I thought that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You thought that? He didn't say anything to you about that,\r\nhowever?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he didn't say anything. Didn't talk much.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is clear in your mind that he just turned around after\r\nyou finished the transaction and left and returned in 40 minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I thought he said he had to get some groceries, but maybe\r\nthat was after he got the luggage, I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You had become aware that afternoon that he had additional\r\narticles of luggage?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Come in about 3, about 4 he got the rest of the luggage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, this additional article of luggage, would you describe\r\nit, as compared with----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Please. As compared with this canvas bag, blue in color,\r\nthat you just told me about?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't pay no attention to it at all. It was just a\r\npiece of luggage.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, was it a----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What I would call a suitcase or what you might call a\r\nsuitcase?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it wasn't a regular suitcase, but just something\r\ninexpensive, just something the boys have, and I didn't pay any\r\nattention to him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it hard-sided?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it was a--you know, it was weak, you know.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Uh-huh. It was weak. Was it strong enough so that it had a\r\nrectangular shape?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You know what I mean by suitcase?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. It is reasonably firm and hard, and has a handle on it?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; it wasn't that way. One of those inexpensive kind of\r\nthings, but I don't know whether it was canvas or what.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was it firmer in shape than the canvas bag you have\r\ndescribed to me that he had earlier?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No. Well, I think it was chuck full.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You know it was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh. It was, I remember. I don't----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Do you remember the color?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No. One of them was blue, and I don't know which one or\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I see.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Let me ask her something.\r\n\r\nMary, would it help you to remember this if you would just begin, you\r\nwere out in the yard, and you went around and interviewed this man\r\nthere, did you stand in the yard, or go in your room and talk? Did he\r\nput up his things then before he came across the hall to talk to you?\r\nWhen did he ask you about groceries? After he signed your register\r\ndid he go back in his room and hang his clothes up, or what happened?\r\nWould it help if you just sit here idly without anybody asking you\r\nquestions and see? Did you go back out in the yard after he paid you\r\nthe money, and while he was gone--if you can, just retrace your steps\r\nwithout anybody interrupting you. Could you begin and go again out in\r\nthe yard, and went around and saw this man here, and he told you he\r\nwanted to rent a room, whether you stood on the porch and talked to\r\nhim, or whether he brought his things and you went on and showed him\r\nthe room? How far is the room from where your front door was? If you go\r\ndown a hall, how far? Did you go over there and talk to him and make\r\narrangements about the rent of the room? Did he hang up his clothes\r\nwhile he was in the room?\r\n\r\nDid he--if you can just trace your steps and give it to him. I ask you\r\nto do that, and I know it is confusing, but that's all he wants.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I am getting tired.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All he wants is the truth, and I thought maybe you might,\r\nfor the sake of the record, you know----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I would have--we have said most everything.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. I know it, but just do it one more time. The man was\r\nstanding at your front door----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I am getting tired, because I have had a stroke, you see.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you go back out in the yard?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I stayed in.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did he leave your house twice? Now, you said he went and\r\ngot a bag and brought it back?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; he did, brought back the bag.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Then he went back again?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. How long was he--all I want to know is just, if you can\r\njust tell that in your own words without any questions. Could you just\r\ndo that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I'd rather they asked, because----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. I know, but it is hard for them to ask these particular\r\nquestions, because they don't know exactly what happened. All they want\r\nto do is to say that you were in the room with him, and put this little\r\nbag down and hung up his clothes, and came across the hall and signed\r\nthe register, see.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, that's all. I don't know whether he put his clothes\r\nand what in the other room. I don't know whether he put his bag----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Was there a closet in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Well, were you with him when he put the clothes in the\r\ncloset, or did you go on across the hall and leave him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, no; I didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you leave his presence--Mary, pardon me, I am\r\nnot--this is not for the record.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. No; that's fine, leave it on the record.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right. When the man was on your front porch.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. He had a blue bag in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. And you don't know whether it was round or bulging, you\r\njust don't know?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You don't know whether it had a long strap or a little\r\nhandle, do you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I think it had a handle.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. But, it wasn't one you sling over your shoulder?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, can you go ahead?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Clothes were sort of hanging over here [indicating].\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Uh-huh. Not covered or anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You couldn't tell anybody about what color the clothes\r\nwere, could you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you stand in the yard and talk to the young man? Or\r\nimmediately go into the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I immediately--I was talking to him, but I had to\r\ngo in immediately, because he wanted to see the room.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right. How far is it, Mrs. Bledsoe, from where you\r\nmet this man at the front door until you showed him the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it is about 25 foot, and all that time I had to\r\nsize him up, you see.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You were talking to him as you went down the hall?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes; getting----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Is that where you learned that he was married, as you\r\nwere walking down the hall?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he told me he was married before we went in the house.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, then, when you got to the room, did you both\r\nwalk inside the room, or stand in the door and talk?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I stood in the door, and he went in and looked at it and\r\ntook it.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did he keep his clothes?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I didn't pay any attention.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. When he was talking to you, you don't know what he did,\r\njust stood and talked to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you leave his presence before he came into your room\r\nand signed the register?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Now, that, Melody----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Were you with him? And took him into the room, and----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Says, \"I'll take the room.\"\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you leave him in the room and you go on across to\r\nyour room? How far is your room from where you rented his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Right next to it. No; he came on in, he came on back\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. He never left your presence from the time you went in\r\nthis room until he came over here?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, did he put his things in your room--or bring\r\nthem with him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he left them in the room.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, you don't know where he put them?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; didn't pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Is there a closet in that room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You don't remember whether he hung his clothes in the\r\ncloset?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. But, he left and came over where you were and signed your\r\nregister, and then did he go back into his room or go down the hall and\r\nleave the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, went back in his room.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right. You don't know how long he stayed in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Now, before he left your room, did he tell you anything\r\nabout going and getting additional luggage, or did you know when he\r\nwas leaving the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I didn't know. He said he was going to get some\r\ngroceries but it might have been that he said that he was going, I\r\ndon't know. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Was it when he signed the register that he asked you\r\nabout the grocery store, or later?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Later.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right. Then you were in your room when he went back\r\nin his room. Did you see him leave his room and go out of the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Then where did you go?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Lord have mercy. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did you go back out in the yard?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't think I went into the yard. I was fooling\r\naround the house.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, how far from your room is your kitchen?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, Lord. It is a long ways. It is clear across the\r\nliving room and dining room and the kitchen is right there [indicating].\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, but your room is right next to the room you\r\nrented to this man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. When did you have knowledge that he was back in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, when--I guess when he brought these--brought the\r\nmilk in.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. How could he go to the grocery store and get milk unless\r\nhe had already asked you where the grocery store was?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I guess he did, he had already.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Okay, then, it was on his return from getting the bag\r\nthat he asked you about the grocery store, is that right? Or do you\r\nremember?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, yes; it wasn't anything said about this when he\r\nrented--about eating. Just--he just rented the room, and not to eat in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Now when you had some kind of knowledge, as you just\r\nsaid, could you hear him back in his room, or could you see him back in\r\nhis room after he left the first time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I heard him.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did he come in and talk to you before he left your house\r\nthe second time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; he never did talk to me at all. He didn't talk.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. The only conversation you had with this Mrs.--with this\r\nMr. Oswald was when he came and rented the room and signed the register?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And what I got out of him. That's all I could get.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Now; did you get any information out of him after he\r\nsigned the register?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, the next day.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. I am talking about this one day.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; didn't get much.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Then all of your conversation that you had this Monday\r\nthat he rented that room took place at one time, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Now, he came back, and for some reason you knew he was in\r\nthere. When did he leave your house the second time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. When he went to get the groceries.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Well, when?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Was he--when he went to leave, did he come in and say,\r\n\"I'm going to get some groceries.\" Did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You evidently told him about the grocery store the first\r\ntime when he signed the register and your conversation with him--\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't either.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Well, you just said you had one conversation with him,\r\nand you had no other conversation with him. Now, just remember these\r\nfacts that you had no conversation with him after he paid you the money\r\nand signed the register.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I wouldn't say, because I don't know what he did. I\r\ndon't remember.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. All right, how long after--when he brought his bag back\r\nand put it in this room, how long did he stay in that room until he\r\nleft to go to the grocery store, if that is where he went?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Was that the first when he went and got the other bag?\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, 20 or 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did he go and use the telephone, or just stay in his room\r\nall that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No, didn't use the phone until--I think he used it after.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Did he use your telephone on Monday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. After the, yes; after he got everything settled, I think\r\nhe did. Two or three times every day. Called his wife, supposed to be.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. You don't know who he called?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I don't know who he called.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. But, you don't know anything at all about when you gave\r\nhim this information about the grocery store? We are just trying to get\r\nthe order here in which this happened, Mrs. Bledsoe, is all, if you can\r\njust remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, Lord.\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. That is the reason I asked you if you could, to write\r\nthese things down.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. I am sorry, but I thought in--I might help you.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he make a telephone call after he became settled?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the 8th of October?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I wouldn't say for sure, but I guess he did, because he\r\ncalled his wife, supposedly--supposed to have been all the time, but in\r\nthe morning he called some people about jobs.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Because he talked on the phone and talked gruff, talked\r\ngruff to those on the phone, and talked about a job. I heard that.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Then, one of the occasions when the gentleman interviewed\r\nyou--were Secret Service and FBI people--there is a notation that you\r\nrecalled that on Monday afternoon that he did call his wife?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, does that refresh your recollection, that he did call\r\nher the same day that he moved in here on----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I guess he did, uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And, were you aware of the fact that he was using the\r\ntelephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Oh, I told him he could use the phone to get him a job\r\nand call his wife.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And were you aware of any occasion on Monday when you had\r\nyour own mental conception that he was actually talking with his wife?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, it didn't--I wasn't interested at all. He--I\r\nwasn't--I didn't think about it at all. When I got interested is when\r\nhe called, talking in that foreign language.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, the first time you heard him talking in the foreign\r\nlanguage was when?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. As well as I can guess, it was a Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Wednesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Wednesday afternoon, but he came on----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, so you assume that the other calls he made on Monday,\r\nsince he did not, I take it, did not speak in a foreign language, or\r\nyou didn't hear him speak in a foreign language on Monday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And you didn't hear him do so on Tuesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. First time you heard him to do that was Wednesday?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well----\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. Ask her if she ever heard him talk to anybody on the\r\ntelephone in English. That is what----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Well, I have assumed that you did hear him talk with people\r\non the telephone using the English language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, was about jobs, about getting a job. He called\r\npeople to get jobs, and then he would become almost mad, and sometimes\r\nhe was mad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I don't know, but he was mad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. About what?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. About what they were talking about. He would get in a bad\r\nhumor, and then the day he made that call, he----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which call?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. That call.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Wednesday? The call in which he spoke in a foreign language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. He was real mad.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. He was angry with the person to whom he was speaking over\r\nthe telephone?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. But, you couldn't understand what he was saying?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. So, you don't know whether he was angry with the person, or\r\nangry with someone else and explaining it to the person on the phone\r\nabout something in anger?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I know he talked in a--he talked in a, I guess it was a\r\nforeign language, and I don't know what it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Just sounded irritated?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was there ever an occasion when you saw him in possession,\r\neither in his room, or carrying a long object wrapped in paper or a\r\nblanket or----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or something as long as 45 inches long?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Seven or eight inches wide?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Didn't have anything like that with him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Anything that you thought could be curtain rods or----\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Or shades that are on the spring, did he ever have any\r\npackage that looked as though that sort of thing might be contained in\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You saw nothing of that nature in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Now, would you describe the room? Was it tastefully\r\ndecorated or--shades, curtains? There was no need for him to have\r\nany--bring anything in to decorate that room, was there?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did he do so?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Brought nothing in of that nature?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. And there was no discussion with you on that subject?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You do have a distinct recollection, do you, that he was\r\nthere on Friday, that would be the 11th, I think?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Friday. That is the day that he stayed in his room all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Stayed in his room all day long?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Just went to the bathroom and came back.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. That was Friday, October 11?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Uh-huh.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. On the 12th, that would be Saturday the 12th of October,\r\ndid he receive any phone calls?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Would you tell me about that?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I think he called somebody--somebody called him,\r\nand I judged it was his wife.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you answer the phone, or did he?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; my son answered.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Your son answered the phone?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. And he called him to the phone, and seemed like that she\r\nwas going to have a child and----\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you gather this from what you heard him say?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. From what they said.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. From his end of the conversation?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. From him, and then I thought he was going to move, and\r\nyou see, I was tickled to death, so, then said, \"Well, I will meet\r\nher,\" or, said that he would meet her, said he would go to the hospital\r\nand meet her, see, but he didn't never get to it, I judged that is what\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You heard enough of the conversation that you have the\r\nrecollection that he said something about his wife possibly having to\r\ngo to the hospital?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. For the delivery of her child?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Was this the first time you had any knowledge that his wife\r\nwas with child?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Did you say anything about that to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. No; I didn't mention it. I never did mention about that\r\nman talking to him either, because it wasn't any of my business.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. Which man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. This man who called and talked to him in the foreign\r\nlanguage. I never did see him.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. How did you know it was a man?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Well, I just judged that it was.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You heard his end of the conversation? He was talking in a\r\nforeign language?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. You assumed from that that whoever was on the other line\r\nwas likewise talking in a foreign language, and you assumed a man,\r\nthough you didn't know?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I don't know, so, I didn't say that, because I don't\r\nknow, but I never did say anything about it.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. I believe that's about all I have.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. What time is it? I'm tired.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It is 5 minutes until 11.\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. I guess he is going to ask something, too, and I will be\r\nup here at 12.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Mrs. Bledsoe, this deposition will be written up by the\r\nreporter, and you can take it and look it over if you wish and change\r\nit in any way and sign it, or if you wish to waive the signature we\r\nwill have it written up and send it to the Commission as it is.\r\n\r\nDo you have any preference that way? Do you want her to waive the\r\nsignature?\r\n\r\nMiss DOUTHIT. I think she can waive it. I don't see any reason for her\r\nto sign it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then can we, on the advice of your attorney, will you waive\r\nthe signature?\r\n\r\nMrs. BLEDSOE. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Fine. You will know that you won't be bothered any more then.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, Mrs. Bledsoe.\r\n\r\nMr. JENNER. We do want you to know that we appreciate your coming in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF WILLIAM W. WHALEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of William W. Whaley was taken at 1:50 p.m., on April 8,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant\r\ncounsel of the President's Commission.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you want to stand and raise your right hand.\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be\r\nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I do, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you state your name, please.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. William W. Whaley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You live in Dallas, Mr. Whaley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You previously testified before the Commission in\r\nWashington, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now before you came to Washington, did you and I ever meet?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Your face is familiar, sir. I still can't tell you whether\r\nI knew you here, or in Washington, or where?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You refresh my memory.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I will try to refresh your memory here. When did you come to\r\nWashington, approximately?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, it's been about 2 or 3 weeks ago, sir. I don't\r\nremember the exact date.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You testified before the President's Commission on the\r\nAssassination of President Kennedy in Washington, did you not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now Mr. Ball and I were with you earlier today over the noon\r\nhour, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That's correct, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Ball and I saw you in Washington, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Now I don't know if that is correct or not, but your face\r\nis very familiar.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You think you have seen me before?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It might have been in Washington when you were there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; it could have been.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Whaley, today at noon there were six people including\r\nyourself that got in the car to travel that route that you drove a\r\npassenger on November 22, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. One of them is sitting here in this room, Dr. Goldberg, over\r\nthere. Do you see him?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you and I got in the car, and then Secret Service Agent\r\nJohn Joe Hewlett. We drove in his car and he was the driver, wasn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then there was Mr. Joe Ball, Joseph A. Ball, and then a Mr.\r\nDavis, this tall light-haired person?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Davis is from the attorney general's office in Texas.\r\n\r\nNow what is the fact as to whether or not we went to the Greyhound Bus\r\nDepot here in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you point out the place where you said you picked up\r\nthis passenger?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We had a stopwatch, didn't we?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you directed us to take a certain route, is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That's correct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was the route from the Greyhound Bus Depot that you\r\ndirected us?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. On the right from the Greyhound and Lamar to Jackson; right\r\non Jackson and left at Austin and right at Wood.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Then left on Houston, which is the approach to the viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do when you got to Houston?\r\n\r\nYou turned left?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I said west to Houston.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you go?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You go on the approach past the Union Terminal and up the\r\nramp which is called the Houston Street viaduct.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. You run into Zangs Boulevard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far on Zangs?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. To Beckley. Beckley crosses it. We got to the intersection\r\nof Zangs and Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did we go about the speed you drove that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Almost. Going across the viaduct is just about the speed,\r\nbut he slowed down going up Zangs Boulevard. He slowed down a little\r\nslower than I was going.\r\n\r\nMy normal rate of speed, I don't remember the exact speed I was\r\ntraveling, but I assume it was normal, because that is the way I travel\r\nall the time when traffic is clear enough.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your normal rate of speed would be a little bit faster than\r\nthe rate that he took?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir. In other words, not enough to make over half a\r\nminute difference in the timing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was traffic clearer on that particular day of November 22?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It was extra clear, for some reason. That street was clear\r\nexcept when I hit Beckley. When I hit Beckley, there was cars turning\r\nto the left, and I had to stop for the light.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When we got to Beckley at noon today, or shortly thereafter,\r\nthe traffic light was green, but you told us you had stopped, so we\r\nwaited through the red light, did we not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then he turned on Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Heading south?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when this man that you picked up on November 22 got into\r\nyour cab, where did he say he wanted to go?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. To the 500 block of North Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I will take you back to November 22.\r\n\r\nYou turned south on Beckley and then where did you go as you turned\r\nsouth on Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I went right up on Beckley headed toward the 500 block.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. When I got to Beckley almost to the intersection of Beckley\r\nand Neely, he said, \"This will do right here,\" and I pulled up to the\r\ncurb.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that the 500 block of North Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; that was the 700 block.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You let him out not at the 500 block but the 700 block of\r\nNorth Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you crossed Neely Street yet when you let him off?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far north of Neely street did you let the man off?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. About 20 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you went down to the police station to identify this\r\nman?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw a lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what number he was in the lineup at all?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. There was four of them, sir, and from the right to the\r\nleft, he was No. 3.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Starting from the right to the left, from his right or your\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. From your right, sir, which would have been his left. There\r\nwere numbers above their heads, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mr. Whaley, what number did you say the man was in the\r\nlineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the right or from your right?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. From my left.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No. 2?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. They brought out four of them and stood them up there, and\r\nhe was under No. 2. I mentioned he was the third one that come out.\r\nThere were four and all handcuffed together.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you sign an affidavit for the Dallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I will hand you a document which I am calling Whaley\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, and ask you to say if your signature appears on\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; that is my signature.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now I notice in the statement there it says that you\r\ntraveled Wood Street to Houston Street, turned left and went over the\r\nviaduct to Zangs Boulevard. You see that statement there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"Traveled Zangs to Beckley and turned left and traveled on\r\nBeckley until I reached the 500 block of North Beckley. When I got in\r\nthe 500 block of North Beckley he said this will do and I stopped.\"\r\n\r\nNow is that what you told them on that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; that is what I told them on that day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, was that the fact that you drove until you reached the\r\n500 block, or not?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir, I didn't drive until I reached the 500 block. I\r\ndrove until I reached Beckley and Neely. If you would be in my place\r\nwhen they took me down there, when they had to force their way through\r\nthe reporters to get me in the office, they wrote that up, and I signed\r\nit, because I told them that the man said he wanted to go to the 500\r\nblock of North Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now in here it says, \"The No. 3 man who I now\r\nknow is Lee Harvey Oswald was the man who I carried from the Greyhound\r\nBus Station * * *\"\r\n\r\nWas this the No. 3 or the No. 2 man?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I signed that statement before they carried me down to see\r\nthe lineup. I signed this statement, and then they carried me down to\r\nthe lineup at 2:30 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You signed this affidavit before you saw the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, now, let's get this straight. You are getting me\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, I will put it this way. There was an FBI reporter, FBI\r\ninterviewer with you?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes, sir; there was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And there was an interview with the Dallas Police Department?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes. And Bill Alexander from the district attorney's office\r\nwas there, also.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, the last sentence.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Let me tell you how they fixed this up. They had me in the\r\noffice saying that. They were writing it out on paper, and they wrote\r\nit out on paper, and this officer, Leavelle, I think that is his name,\r\nbefore he finished and before I signed he wanted me to go with him to\r\nthe lineup, so I went to the lineup, and I come back and he asked me\r\nwhich one it was, which number it was, and I identified the man, and we\r\nwent back up in the office again, and then they had me sign this. That\r\nis as near as I can remember.\r\n\r\nMy recollection for that afternoon in that office was very disturbed\r\nbecause everytime they would open the door, some flash camera would\r\nflash in your face and everybody coming in and out and asking you\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean reporters?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I made this statement more to Bill Alexander, because I\r\ntried to talk to him more. Everybody was trying to talk to me at once.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you saw the statement the first time, did you see the\r\nstatement before you went down to see the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No; I didn't see the statement. I don't think I did. I am\r\nnot for sure.\r\n\r\nI think I signed it after I came back. It was on paper. They were\r\nwriting it up on paper.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. They were writing?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Before I left there, I signed this typewritten, because\r\nthey had to get, a stenographer typed it up. I had to wait.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But was this before or after you saw the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. After she typed it up. It was after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was after?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is when I signed it, after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, when you signed it--what I want to know is, before you\r\nwent down, had they already put on there a statement that the man you\r\nsaw was the No. 3 man in the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't remember that. I don't remember whether it said\r\nthree or two, or what.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did they have any statements on there before you went down\r\nto the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I never saw what they had in there. It was all written out\r\nby hand. The statement I saw, I think, was this one, and that could be\r\nwriting. I might not even seen this one yet. I signed my name because\r\nthey said that is what I said.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, Mr. Whaley----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I know, sir, but I don't think you can understand what I\r\nhad to put up with that afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean with the press?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; with everything.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, I do understand, sir, and I appreciate that you were\r\nunder a great deal of pressure at that time, and I want to try and\r\nget at the actual facts, and that is why we asked you to come back to\r\ntestify again, because we wanted to know basically whether or not the\r\nman that you drove in the cab got off in the 500 block or the 700 block.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The man I drove in the cab got off where I told you he got\r\noff, this morning.\r\n\r\nI picked him up, and I showed you where I picked him up, and the trip\r\nruns 95 cents on the meter. He gave me a dollar and got off and he\r\nnever spoke a word to me, except he wanted to go to 500 North Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember a woman coming up to the cab?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; I remember that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What happened then?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The lady, I don't remember whether she was very old, but\r\nshe was middle-aged. She bent down and stuck in and said, \"Can I have\r\nthis cab?\" And he cracked the door open like he was going to get out. I\r\nthought he was going to let her have it.\r\n\r\nI told her there would be another one, and she said, \"Would you please\r\ncall me one.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he say anything to the woman, that you can remember?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. When she wanted to know if she could have the cab, I don't\r\nknow, but I got a faint hunch he did tell her she could have this one,\r\nor something like that. What it was, I was watching my left-hand side.\r\nI wanted to pull out when the light changed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when you saw a lineup down at the police station----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He didn't have on the same clothes. He had on a white\r\nT-shirt and black pants, and that is all he had on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember now whether the man that you saw there was\r\nthe No. 2 or the No. 3 man?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I will admit he was No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No. 2 from your left, or from your right?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. He was the third man out in the line of four as they walked\r\nout in a line. They put the first man out on the right, and the last\r\none on my left, and as near as I can remember, he was No. 2, but it was\r\nthe man I hauled.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It says here the No. 3.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, I am not trying to mix nobody up. I'm giving it to\r\nyou the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Your memory right now is that it was the No. 2 man?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is the way it is right now. I don't think it will\r\nchange again.\r\n\r\nBut on that afternoon, all I saw was the man that I hauled up there,\r\nand they asked me which number he was, and I said No. 2. I am almost\r\nsure I did, but I couldn't get up to swear to it that I did, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Just one more minute, if you would, please?\r\n\r\nMr. Whaley, earlier in your testimony here you said that Lee Harvey\r\nOswald was No. 3. Do you remember saying that?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; but I meant that he was the third one out when\r\nthey walked out with him. I said from my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From your right he was No. 3?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What number was over his head?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, they--when they walked over the line and they stopped\r\nhim, No. 2 was over his head, but he was pulling on both of the other\r\nmen on each side and arguing with this detective, so he didn't stay\r\nunder any certain number.\r\n\r\nHe was moving like that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see him later on television?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You never did see his picture in the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I saw his picture in the paper the next morning, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would have been Sunday morning, the 24th?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I guess it was, if you say it was, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I don't want to----\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't want to get you mixed up and get your whole\r\ninvestigation mixed up through my ignorance, but a good defense\r\nattorney could take me apart. I get confused. I try to tell you exactly\r\nwhat happened, to the best of my ability, when they brought Oswald out\r\nin the lineup of four. He was the third man out. I don't know which way\r\nthey count them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We don't want you to be concerned about affecting the\r\ninvestigation one way or the other by what you say. What we want you to\r\nsay is tell us what you know, to the best of your recollection.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That is exactly what I am doing, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. What day of the week did you take this\r\ncab passenger, on a Friday or Saturday?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I would have to see my trip sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You don't remember?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it the day of the motorcade?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The day of the President's parade, yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, was it that day that you went down to the police\r\nstation to see the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it the next day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The next day you went down to the Dallas Police Station and\r\nsaw a lineup of how many people?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Four people.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. These men came out and there were numbers above their heads?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. The numbers were stationary. Looked through a black silk\r\nscreen at them. In other words, they were very dim, the numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see as the number over the man that you\r\nidentified as having been in your cab that day?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see a picture of that man in the paper at any time?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Saturday morning, sir; following the event on Friday.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw his picture in the paper?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that the same man that you identified as No. 2 in the\r\nlineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever see his picture in the paper again?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; I take that back, sir. I saw the picture in the\r\npaper when they had, when Ruby killed him at the time between the two\r\ndetectives.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the man in connection with the Ruby matter with the two\r\ndetectives, did it have his name in the paper as Lee Harvey Oswald? Was\r\nhis name in the paper then when you saw his picture?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, I don't think they had it that way. I think they just\r\nhad it Oswald. I am not sure what they had under it. I am not for sure,\r\nbut I did see the picture.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that the same man you carried in your cab on Friday?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that the man you identified at the police station?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It is your best recollection, if I understand it, that this\r\nwas the No. 2 man in the lineup?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That's right, sir. That was from the left now. No. 2 from\r\nmy left. I was facing him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Right. I mean correct. Now, your affidavit which is Whaley's\r\nDeposition Exhibit A, the last sentence says, \"The No. 3 man who I now\r\nknow as Lee Harvey Oswald was the man who I carried from the Greyhound\r\nbus station to the 500 block of North Beckley.\" Now you say it was the\r\nNo. 2 man from your left, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. From my left. No. 3 from my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about whether or not you carried him to the 500 block\r\nof North Beckley. Did you carry him there?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir. That is where he asked me. That is where I put on\r\nmy trip sheet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had it on the trip sheet the 500 block of North Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you put it on your trip sheet, before or after you\r\nlet him out?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. After, sir; a good while after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, see, sometimes when you are busy you make three or\r\nfour trips before you ever write one up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why didn't you put it on your trip sheet for 700 instead of\r\n500 North Beckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Because that is what he told me and that is what I remember\r\nwhen I wrote the trip up. I imagine there were hundreds of trip sheets,\r\nbecause people get off before they get where they are going. But I\r\nremember the thing that way.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you first ascertain or start thinking about it that\r\nit was the 700 block of North Beckley where you let him off?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Well, when the FBI man got in my cab and he wanted to go\r\nover the route.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When was this?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. I don't know the exact date, sir, but it was the next week.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In the next week you told the FBI that it was the 700 block?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; I don't recall. I know I took him to where I let\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You did?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever tell anyone it was the 700 block of North\r\nBeckley?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir. I left it said just like I had it on my trip\r\nsheet. Nobody else asked me about it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When we went out there today, when we started the stopwatch\r\nfrom the Greyhound bus station to the 700 block of North Beckley, do\r\nyou know about how many minutes that was on the stop watch?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. A little more than 5 minutes, between 5 and 6 minutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would your trip that day, on November 22, have been longer\r\nor shorter, or about the same time as the trip we took today?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It would be approximately the same time, sir, give or take\r\na few seconds, not minutes. Because the man drove just about as near to\r\nmy driving as possible. We made every light that I made, and we stopped\r\non the lights that I stopped on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let the record show that the stopwatch was 5 minutes and\r\n30 seconds from the commencement of the ride to the end of the ride,\r\nand let the record further show that Dr. Goldberg and Mr. Robert Davis\r\nfrom the Texas attorney general's office and I walked back from the\r\npoint where the Deponent Whaley told us he let the passenger off at the\r\nresidence at 1026 North Beckley, and that this walk took 5 minutes and\r\n45 seconds.\r\n\r\nAnd let the record further show that after visiting the rooming house\r\nat 1026 North Beckley--that is what I call the \"long way around\r\nroute,\"--was walked from 1026 North Beckley to the scene of the Tippit\r\nshooting, which took 17 minutes and 45 seconds at an average walking\r\npace, and this route would be to take Beckley to 10th Street and then\r\nturn on 10th Street toward Patton, and this is not the most direct\r\nroute. Rather, the most direct route would be to take Beckley to Davis\r\nStreet and then turn left or east on Davis, walking a short block to\r\nCrawford, and taking Crawford to 10th, and then 10th east to Patton, or\r\ntaking Davis Street directly to Patton, and taking Patton down to East\r\n10th, and that the more direct nature of the later route appears from\r\nthe map which I believe is Commission's Exhibit No. 371, which is the\r\nDallas street map.\r\n\r\nMr. Whaley, is there anything else that you care to add, or can you add\r\nanything else that might be helpful in this investigation?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. No, sir; I can't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. We sure appreciate all your help and taking the time to go\r\nover the route today.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Thank you. I still would like to know where I knew you\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Sir, I don't know. Now, Mr. Whaley, if you like, you can\r\ncome back and read this deposition after it is typed, and sign it\r\nbefore you mail it to Washington, or you can waive the signing of it.\r\nYou have a right to read it and sign it before it goes, or you can\r\nwaive the reading of it and send it directly to us in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Does it make any difference?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It does not make any difference.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. It will all be what you said and what she took down?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What you said?\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. Yes, sir; and what I said?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. WHALEY. That will be all right. I will waive the signing of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. EARLENE ROBERTS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mrs. Earlene Roberts was taken at 4:10 p.m., on April\r\n8, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and\r\nSamuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr.\r\nAlfred Goldberg was present.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Would you stand and take the oath?\r\n\r\nDo you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the\r\nCommission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth, so help you God?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Will you state your name, please?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Mrs. Earlene Roberts.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what is your address?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. 5000 Tremont, now.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You used to live at 1026 North Beckley, didn't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; I did.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Tell me something about yourself, Mrs. Roberts, where you\r\nwere born and where you have lived?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I was born in Nashville, Tenn., and my mother and father\r\nmoved to Tyler, Tex., and I was raised there and married a Dallas man.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you go to school in Tyler?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How far through school did you go?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. To my sorrows, I got married in the ninth grade.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did--you got married in the ninth grade?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you get married in Dallas or in Tyler?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. In Tyler.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have some children?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; to my sorrows--I couldn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did you do in Tyler then--until you came to Dallas?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I was a PBX operator at the Hotel Blackstone. That's\r\nwhere I met my husband.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long have you lived here?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Since 1938.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of work have you done?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, until he passed away--I didn't work for I didn't\r\nhave to. He made me a good living, but since that time I have\r\nbeen--well, just, I guess you would call it practical nursing or\r\nhousekeeping and now I am with an elderly couple--he has cancer--the\r\nsame kind that Sam Rayburn had and he's taken with leukemia.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's at the address you have just given us?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, you know Mrs. Johnson, don't you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; I knew her very muchly so.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did you work for her?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, this last time I was there around 13 months--that\r\nwas the third time I had went back.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When did you start working for her?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I started working for her in 1949 the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you worked for her three times altogether?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; I got sick the first time--I'm a diabetic and wasn't\r\nable to do the work and one day she called me again and wanted to know\r\nif I would do it and I went back and stayed again and I went in a coma\r\nand had to leave, and the reason why I left this time, she cut me down\r\nso low and the work was too heavy--I wasn't able to do the work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean she cut you down on your money?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, yes; and I can't pay my doctor bill and buy my\r\nmedicine at that price.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean, she didn't pay you enough--that's the reason you\r\nquit?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That's the reason why I quit--the work was too heavy and\r\nI wasn't able to do it and not enough pay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you were working there in October and November of last\r\nfall--1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; to my sorrows.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why to your sorrows?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, he was registered as O. H. Lee and I come to find\r\nout he was Oswald and I wish I had never known it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, they put me through the third degree.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Who did?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. The FBI, Secret Service, Mr. Will Fritz' men and Bill\r\nDecker's.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. They did?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Every time I would walk out on the front porch somebody\r\nwas standing with a camera on me--they had me scared to death.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When is the first time you ever saw Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. The day he came in and rented the room--the 14th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever heard of the man before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, and he didn't register as Oswald--he registered as O.\r\nH. Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he sign his name?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. O. H. Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he sign his own name that way?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. O. H. Lee--that's what he was registered as.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you rent it to him, or did Mrs. Johnson?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I rented the room to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You did?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. She talked to him, and she had to go back to the work and\r\nthat was what I was supposed to do--I rented the rooms--she didn't know\r\nwhat vacancies she had.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you have \"room for rent\" sign out in the front?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What time of day did he come in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, it was in the early afternoon--I imagine between 1\r\nand 2 o'clock when he came in and looked at the room; and he rented it\r\nand paid for it; and then left, and went and got his things and I don't\r\nknow--it must have been around 5 or 6 o'clock when he come back in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say he went and got his things--what did he have with him\r\nat first when he came there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Just a little satchel bag and some clothes on a hanger.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What kind of a satchel bag?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. One of them little zip kinds.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What color was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. It was just--don't ask me that for I can't answer that.\r\nIt was just a dark bag is all I know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did he stay that first time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oswald?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I mean before he went away to get his clothes, when he first\r\ncame in--you say he rented a room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He rented the room and paid me $8 for it and he said,\r\n\"I'll go get my things and I will be back.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say where he was going to get them?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, he didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he leave?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; he left.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have a car he was riding in?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't know--I didn't see it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he take a bus?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't know?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, I don't. I don't remember--you know in a place like\r\nthat--when you rent a room--I didn't pay no attention.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And he came back about what time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, I imagine around 5 o'clock, maybe.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he have with him at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That little zipper satchel bag and some clothes on a\r\nhanger.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. The first time he came to see you he had a zipper satchel\r\nbag?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; he didn't have nothing when he first come in and\r\nrented the room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He didn't have anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--he just came in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Oh, when he came back he had the zipper satchel and the\r\nclothes on the hanger, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--he rented the room and paid for it and said, \"I'll\r\ngo get my things.\" That's when he went and come back with his little\r\nsatchel bag and some clothes on a hanger, which was a very few.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did he have anything to say when he came back?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he tell you where he had been?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he stay there that night?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever talk to him about anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; because he wouldn't talk.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say \"Hello\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or, \"Goodby\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Or anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He wouldn't say nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever speak to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, yes--I would say, \"Good afternoon,\" and he would\r\njust maybe look at me--give me a dirty look and keep walking and go on\r\nto his room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he watch television?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--in a way--but all he did ever watch the television\r\nwas if someone in the other rooms had it on, maybe he would come and\r\nstand at the back of the couch--not over 5 minutes and go to his room\r\nand shut the door and never say a word.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he go out any at night?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he stay home every night?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes--he stayed home every night--I didn't ever know of\r\nhim going out. If he did, he left after I went to bed and I never knew\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was he gone any weekends?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He would leave on Friday nights--he did say this much--he\r\nsaid, \"Now, over weekends I will be out of town.\" He didn't say what\r\ntown. He said, \"I will be going out of town visiting friends.\" He would\r\nleave Friday morning for work and he wouldn't come back any more until\r\nMonday afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, was one weekend when he didn't come back on Monday?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; there was one weekend that he didn't go out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which one was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Now, as far as--you know what?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that the weekend?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I think--now, if I had the books, I could tell you.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Which books?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. The books that are over there on North Beckley. I believe\r\nit was on the weekend before--when was President Kennedy shot?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 22d of November.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. What day was that--that was on Friday, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was on a Friday.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, it was on the weekend before that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What happened--what was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He didn't go nowhere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He stayed in all weekend, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, sir; and then that first Thursday, he got up\r\nThursday and left for work and he didn't come back no more until\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He left on Thursday and didn't come home on Thursday night?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He didn't spend Thursday night there and that was\r\nunusual, because he would always leave on Friday. That's the best I\r\ncan do. He was just the type of person you just don't know--and I just\r\nthought he didn't like people and he would mix with nobody and he\r\nwouldn't say nothing. The only time he would ever say anything was when\r\nhis rent was due and he was never behind.\r\n\r\nI'll tell you when it was--it was when he didn't come back on Monday,\r\nyou know, there was a holiday that people took off work.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was Armistice Day.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That he said, \"I have a long weekend.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He didn't come back on that Monday?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, he didn't come back until the next day. He said he\r\nhad a long weekend.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was after his long weekend he came back on a Tuesday\r\nthat week?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember the day the President was shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; I remember it--who would forget that?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And the police officers came out there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember what they said?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, it was Will Fritz' men--it was plainclothesmen and\r\nI was at the back doing something and Mr. Johnson answered the door and\r\nthey identified themselves and then he called me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did they say?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, they asked him if there was a Harvey Lee Oswald\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What did he say?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. And he says, \"I don't know, I'll have to call the\r\nhousekeeper,\" and he called me and I went and got the books and I said,\r\n\"No; there's no one here by that name,\" and they tried to make me\r\nremember and I couldn't, and Mrs. Johnson come in in the meantime and\r\nthere wasn't nobody there by that name, and Mrs. Johnson said, \"Mrs.\r\nRoberts, don't you have him?\" And, I said, \"No; we don't, for here is\r\nmy book and there is nobody there by that name.\" We checked it back a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you didn't have that name--you didn't ever know his name\r\nwas Lee Oswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--he registered as O. H. Lee and they were asking for\r\nHarvey Lee Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say that you saw Lee Oswald--you say he didn't come home\r\nThursday night that week?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He didn't come home on Thursday night that week.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And Friday was the day the President was shot? Had you seen\r\nhim at any time that Friday before the officers came up and knocked on\r\nyour door?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Hadn't he been home?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, let's see--that was the day.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was on a Friday----\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Wait a minute, let me think of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's on a Friday.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I had better back up a minute--he came home that Friday\r\nin an unusual hurry.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And about what time was this?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, it was after President Kennedy had been shot and I\r\nhad a friend that said, \"Roberts, President Kennedy has been shot,\" and\r\nI said, \"Oh, no.\" She said, \"Turn on your television,\" and I said \"What\r\nare you trying to do, pull my leg?\" And she said, \"Well, go turn it\r\non.\" I went and turned it on and I was trying to clear it up--I could\r\nhear them talking but I couldn't get the picture and he come in and\r\nI just looked up and I said, \"Oh, you are in a hurry.\" He never said\r\na thing, not nothing. He went on to his room and stayed about 3 or 4\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. As he came in, did you say anything else except, \"You are in\r\na hurry\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say anything about the President being shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You were working with the television?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I was trying to clear it up to see what was happening and\r\ntry to find out about President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Why did you say to this man as he came in, \"You are in a\r\nhurry,\"--why did you say that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, he just never has come in and he was walking\r\nunusually fast and he just hadn't been that way and I just looked up\r\nand I said, \"Oh, you are in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean he was walking faster than he usually was?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came in the door, what did he do?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He just walked in--he didn't look around at me--he didn't\r\nsay nothing and went on to his room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he run?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He wasn't running, but he was walking pretty fast--he was\r\nall but running.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, what happened after that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He went to his room and he was in his shirt sleeves but\r\nI couldn't tell you whether it was a long-sleeved shirt or what color\r\nit was or nothing, and he got a jacket and put it on--it was kind of a\r\nzipper jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen him wear that jacket before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I can't say I did--if I did, I don't remember it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came in he was in a shirt?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He was in his shirt sleeves.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What color was his shirt? Do you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't remember. I didn't pay that much attention for I\r\nwas interested in the television trying to get it fixed.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen that shirt before or seen him wear it--the\r\nshirt, or do you know?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't remember--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You say he put on a separate jacket?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. A jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. I'll show you this jacket which is Commission Exhibit\r\n162--have you ever seen this jacket before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, maybe I have, but I don't remember it. It seems\r\nlike the one he put on was darker than that. Now, I won't be sure,\r\nbecause I really don't know, but is that a zipper jacket?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes--it has a zipper down the front.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, maybe it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was a zippered jacket, was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; it was a zipper jacket. How come me to remember it,\r\nhe was zipping it up as he went out the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He was zipping it up as he went out the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, when you saw him, did you see any part of his belt?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There is some suspicion that when he left there he might have\r\nhad a pistol or a revolver in his belt; did you see anything like that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; I sure didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, I show you Commission Exhibit No. 150--it is a\r\nshirt--have you seen that before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, maybe I have. Now, that looks kind of like the dark\r\nshirt that he had on.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, when Oswald came in, he was in a shirt--does this shirt\r\nlook anything like the shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. It was a dark shirt he had on--I think it was a dark one,\r\nbut whether it was long sleeve or short sleeve or what--I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Does the color of this shirt which I show you here,\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 150, look anything like the shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I'm sorry, I just don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You are not able to testify as to that--to tell us that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Can you tell me what time it was approximately that Oswald\r\ncame in?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Now, it must have been around 1 o'clock, or maybe\r\na little after, because it was after President Kennedy had been\r\nshot--what time I wouldn't want to say because----\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. How long did he stay in the room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, maybe not over 3 or 4 minutes--just long enough, I\r\nguess, to go in there and get a jacket and put it on and he went out\r\nzipping it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You recall he went out zipping it--was he running or walking?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He was walking fast--he was making tracks pretty fast.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say anything to you as he went out?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you say anything to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Probably wouldn't have gotten no answer.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. What is the only thing you said to him from the time he came\r\nin the house until he left?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. \"You sure are in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that all?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That was all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That's all you said to him?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That's all I said to him.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he say anything to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Nothing.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He didn't say nothing--he wouldn't say nothing--period.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have the same colored pants on when he left, or do you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. What?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did he have the same colored pants on when he came in as when\r\nhe went out?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Now, I wouldn't say that because I don't remember--I\r\ndidn't pay that much attention. I didn't mean to be hateful, but I\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, did it appear to you he had on the same pants or\r\ndifferent pants from the time he came in and when he went out?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, I just didn't pay that much attention. All I\r\nremember--he was zipping up a coat and I was trying to find out about\r\nPresident Kennedy--I was still trying to find out about President\r\nKennedy--they was broadcasting it then--I was more interested in that.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen a gun in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever cleaned up his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; I cleaned his rooms, but I didn't see no gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever go through any of his effects?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, no.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There was a little wooden commode or closet in there, wasn't\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. There was a chifforobe--yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever look in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir; I sure didn't--that's against the rules--to\r\nransack their things.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there any drawers or anything in there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; there was drawers in that chifforobe and he also had\r\na vanity dresser with four drawers.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever look inside of that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. After he left the house and at sometime later in the\r\nafternoon, these police officers came out, did they?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And they asked you if there was a man named Lee Oswald there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you told them \"No\"?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then what happened after that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, he was trying to make us understand that--I had two\r\nnew men and they told me--Mrs. Johnson told me, \"Go get your keys and\r\nlet them see in\" I had gone to the back and they still had the TV on,\r\nand they was broadcasting about Kennedy.\r\n\r\nJust as I unlocked the doors Fritz' men, two of them had walked in and\r\nshe come running in and said, \"Oh, Roberts, come here quick. This is\r\nthis fellow Lee in this little room next to yours,\" and they flashed\r\nhim on television, is how come us to know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then you knew it was the man?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; and I come in there and she said, \"Wait,\" and then\r\nagain they flashed him back on and I said, \"Yes, that's him--that's O.\r\nH. Lee right here in this room.\" And it was just a little wall there\r\nbetween him and I.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. That was the first you knew who it was?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, because he was registered as O. H. Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever know he had a gun in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; I sure did not.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever appear on a television interview with Mr. or\r\nMrs. Johnson--either one?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, no; they was on and would be on and then they had\r\nme on twice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On television?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. On television.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I was in the living room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And they brought their cameras into the living room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. They brought their cameras into the living room and took\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were you alone?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, I was then, because they was questioning me. They\r\nasked Mr. and Mrs. Johnson not to be in there at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Then, they questioned you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you ever have an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Johnson\r\nbeing there?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, yes; one time, and then they would question them\r\nseparate from me.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was there any one time when they questioned all three of you\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes--one time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Just one time--were you ever on television when you and Mrs.\r\nJohnson were on it alone together?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. She and Mr. Johnson would be together and then I would be\r\nat the back when they put them on television, and then they had me on\r\ntwo different times and I was alone. They taken me when I was standing\r\nand showed them where it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on television did they ever ask you if Oswald had a gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You don't remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did they ever ask you if you knew whether Oswald had a gun in\r\nhis room or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes; they asked me and I told them \"No\"--for I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You didn't know whether he had a gun in there or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never saw one?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you tell them that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I sure did--I didn't know he had a gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And when he was zipping up his jacket, his belt was covered?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Was it covered--well--I don't know. I just couldn't\r\nanswer you--I don't know--I don't remember it. I couldn't any more tell\r\nyou than the man in the moon whether or not the man's belt was covered\r\nor uncovered. All I know he was zipping his coat.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me ask you another question: Did you ever talk to a\r\nreporter from a French newspaper?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. A French newspaper?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, there was people in there from about everywhere,\r\nbut I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. There was some French newspaperman who claims he interviewed\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. French?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you remember any French newspapermen interviewing you?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, I don't remember, but there were people in there from\r\nsomewhere but I don't remember where they were from.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald before the\r\nFriday when the police came out?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you had, of course, thought his name was what?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. O. H. Lee.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He had paid you, had he?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He always paid on time.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you made a record of it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, after these police officers came out of there, did you\r\nsee a gun holster in his room after they had searched it?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes--there was one of them little outfits--a little\r\nholster and they taken it out and where they got it--I don't know, but\r\nit was in the room. They had it in their hands, one of the men was\r\nholding it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever seen that before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No; I hadn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Let me ask you something about his habits again--how early\r\nwould he leave his room in the morning?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, he would leave around 7 o'clock, maybe between 6:30\r\nand 7.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And what time would he come back?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, he would get home about maybe 5--something around 5\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And with the exception of the weekends that he spent away,\r\nwas he home every night or was he out at night?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He was always home at night--he never went out.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, on one holiday that occurred on Monday--he didn't come\r\nin?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, he didn't come in that Monday.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Was that the only Monday he didn't come in?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. That was the only Monday he didn't come in.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He paid on Monday?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He paid on Monday and that was the only time he didn't\r\npay on Monday and he wasn't there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. He paid on what day of the week that week?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Tuesday--when he came in home.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. But the weekend before November 22d, he was there all\r\nweekend, was he?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, I also will ask you whether or not you ever heard of a\r\nfellow by the name of Ruby--did you ever hear of a fellow by the name\r\nof Jack Ruby?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had you ever heard his name before he was accused of shooting\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never even heard his name?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You never even heard his name?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--I never heard his name.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And had never seen him?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did a police car pass the house there and honked?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When was that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. He came in the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. When he came in the house?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. When he came in the house and went to his room, you know\r\nhow the sidewalk runs?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Right direct in front of that door--there was a police\r\ncar stopped and honked. I had worked for some policemen and sometimes\r\nthey come by and tell me something that maybe their wives would want me\r\nto know, and I thought it was them, and I just glanced out and saw the\r\nnumber, and I said, \"Oh, that's not their car,\" for I knew their car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You mean, it was not the car of the policemen you knew?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. It wasn't the police car I knew, because their number was\r\n170 and it wasn't 170 and I ignored it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And who was in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't know--I didn't pay any attention to it after I\r\nnoticed it wasn't them--I didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was it parked?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. It was parked in front of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. At 1026 North Beckley?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. And then they just eased on--the way it is--it was the\r\nthird house off of Zangs and they just went on around the corner that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Went around what corner?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Went around the corner off of Beckley on Zangs.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Going which way--toward town or away from town?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Toward town.\r\n\r\nDr. GOLDBERG. Which way was the car facing?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. It was facing north.\r\n\r\nDr. GOLDBERG. Towards Zangs?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Towards Zangs--for I was the third house right off of\r\nZangs on Beckley.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did this police car stop directly in front of your house?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes--it stopped directly in front of my house and it just\r\n\"tip-tip\" and that's the way Officer Alexander and Charles Burnely\r\nwould do when they stopped, and I went to the door and looked and saw\r\nit wasn't their number.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Where was Oswald when this happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. In his room.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was after he had come in his room?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Had that police car ever stopped there before?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I don't know--I don't remember ever seeing it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Have you ever seen it since?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No--I didn't pay that much attention--I just saw it\r\nwasn't the police car that I knew and had worked for so, I forgot about\r\nit. I seen it at the time, but I don't remember now what it was.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you report the number of the car to anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I think I did--I'm not sure, because I--at that\r\nparticular time I remembered it.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. You remembered the number of the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I think it was--106, it seems to me like it was 106, but\r\nI do know what theirs was--it was 170 and it wasn't their car.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. It was not 170?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. The people I worked for was 170.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Did you report that number to anyone, did you report this\r\nincident to anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, I told the FBI and the Secret Service both when they\r\nwas out there.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And did you tell them the number of the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. I'm not sure--I believe I did--I'm not sure. I think I\r\ndid because--there was so much happened then until my brains was in a\r\nwhirl.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. On the 29th of November, Special Agents Will Griffin and\r\nJames Kennedy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed you\r\nand you told them that \"after Oswald had entered his room about 1 p.m.\r\non November 22, 1963, you looked out the front window and saw police\r\ncar No. 207.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. No. 107.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Is that the number?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes--I remembered it. I don't know where I got that\r\n106--207. Anyway, I knew it wasn't 170.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And you say that there were two uniformed policemen in the\r\ncar?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes, and it was in a black car. It wasn't an accident\r\nsquad car at all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Were there two uniformed policemen in the car?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And one of the officers sounded the horn?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Just kind of a \"tit-tit\"--twice.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. And then drove on to Beckley toward Zangs Boulevard, is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes. I thought there was a number, but I couldn't\r\nremember it but I did know the number of their car--I could tell that.\r\nI want you to understand that I have been put through the third degree\r\nand it's hard to remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Are there any other questions?\r\n\r\nDr. GOLDBERG. No, that's all.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Now, Mrs. Roberts, this deposition will be written up and you\r\ncan read it if you want to and you can sign it, or you can waive the\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, you know, I can't see too good how to read. I'm\r\ncompletely blind in my right eye.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Do you want to waive your signature? And then you won't have\r\nto come back down here.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right, you waive it then?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Yes.\r\n\r\nDo you want me to sign it now?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. No; we couldn't, because this young lady has to write it up\r\nand it will be a couple of weeks before it will be ready.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Well, will you want me to come back or how?\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Well, you can waive your signature and you won't have to come\r\nback to do that--do you want to do that?\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. Okay, it will be all right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. All right. The Secret Service will take you home now.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BALL. Thank you for coming.\r\n\r\nMrs. ROBERTS. All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF DOMINGO BENAVIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Domingo Benavides was taken at 2:30 p.m., on April 2,\r\n1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,\r\nBryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W.

That is, as a mechanic?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How long have you been working for Dootch now?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, off and on about 3 years. During this time I went\r\nback to Merchants Delivery and worked there and then I worked for\r\nSouthern Delivery, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now when was the last time you went back to Dootch Motors?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It's been a year ago.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have been working for them ever since?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Taking you back to November 22, 1963, anything unusual\r\nhappen that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. On the 22d?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 22d of November 1963?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. This would be embarrassing. Was that the day of the\r\nAssassination of the President?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I was thinking it was the 24th. Well, nothing except it\r\nseemed like a pretty nice day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what day of the week it was?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember the day that the President was assassinated?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember that he was assassinated in Dallas?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Oh, yes; I remember this.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That day you had lunch, were you at work that day?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You had lunch?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I had lunch. And then this man had stalled this car in\r\nthe middle of the street and asked me if I would fix it. Something was\r\nwrong with the carburetor, or pump that had broken in it, and I went\r\naround to the parts house to get the parts for it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where had the man's car stopped in the middle of the street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, on Patton Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Patton and what?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Between Jefferson and 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A car stopped in the middle of the street between----\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Jefferson and Tenth.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time of day was this?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I imagine it was about 1 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You imagine it was about 1 o'clock?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It was after lunch. I had already eaten. It was after I\r\nhad lunch and I had eaten around 12, somewhere around 12 o'clock.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do? You were going to get a carburetor part, so\r\nwhat did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I was in a rush and I ran off and forgot the number of\r\nthe carburetor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You forgot the number of the carburetor?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I circled back. I left down the alley.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which alley is this?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The one directly between 10th and Patton and Jefferson\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It runs parallel to 10th and Jefferson and it runs, the\r\nalley would run east of Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. The alley runs right behind Dootch Motors there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of vehicle were you driving?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. 1958 pickup truck Chevrolet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, what route did you take? Were you headed east or\r\nwest in the alley?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. East.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. To what?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. To Denver street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which is the next street over from Patton?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. First street east of Patton, then where?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I turned right, which is east on 10th. Wait. Denver\r\nwould be north, I imagine. I turned from the alley north on Denver.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. And east on 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you turned east on----\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The parts house sets on Marsalis and 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Marsalis and 10th?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes; so I got almost up to the parts house and I thought\r\nabout the number, so I was going to go back and get the number off the\r\ncarburetor. I turned in a drive and turned around and started back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On what street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. On 10th Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On East 10th?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I was going west on 10th Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I got almost up to the corner when I seen the\r\npoliceman. I first seen the car stop up there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, you say you got almost to a corner. What corner was\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. At Denver and 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You almost got up to Denver and 10th heading west on 10th\r\nStreet when you saw something?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I saw this police car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw a police car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the police car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It was sitting about 4 or 5 feet from the curb and down\r\nabout 2 houses from the corner of Patton Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Was it between Patton and Denver?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. On what side of East 10th, north or south?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. On the south side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What direction was it headed?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It was headed east.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see then?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I then pulled on up and I seen this officer standing by\r\nthe door. The door was open to the car, and I was pretty close to him,\r\nand I seen Oswald, or the man that shot him, standing on the other side\r\nof the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Did you see the officer as he was getting out of\r\nthe car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; I seen as he was, well, he had his hand on the door\r\nand kind of in a hurry to get out, it seemed like.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had he already gotten out of the car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He had already gotten around.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did you see the other man?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The other man was standing to the right side of the\r\ncar, riders side of the car, and was standing right in front of the\r\nwindshield on the right front fender. And then I heard the shot.\r\nActually I wasn't looking for anything like that, so I heard the shot,\r\nand I just turned into the curb. Looked around to miss a car, I think.\r\n\r\nAnd then I pulled up to the curb, hitting the curb, and I ducked down,\r\nand then I heard two more shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear all told?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I heard three shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You heard three shots?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when your vehicle stopped?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. About 15 foot, just directly across the street and maybe\r\na car length away from the police car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you have been a car length to the east or a car length\r\nto the west of the police car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. East of the front side of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So your vehicle wouldn't have quite gotten up to where the\r\npolice car was?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; it didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How fast were you going when you watched the policeman\r\ngetting out of his car?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Oh, I imagine not maybe 25 miles an hour. I never did\r\npay much attention to it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say you stopped the car right away? Your vehicle, I mean?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir. I just didn't exactly stop because--I just\r\npulled it into the curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you say you heard a shot and you then ducked?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes. No; I heard the shot before I pulled in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Oh, I see. You heard the shot and pulled in and then what?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I ducked down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what happened?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I heard the other two shots and I looked up and the\r\npoliceman was in, he seemed like he kind of stumbled and fell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see the policeman as he fell?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What else did you see?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I seen the man turn and walk back to the sidewalk\r\nand go on the sidewalk and he walked maybe 5 foot and then kind of\r\nstalled. He didn't exactly stop. And he threw one shell and must have\r\ntook five or six more steps and threw the other shell up, and then he\r\nkind of stepped up to a pretty good trot going around the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw the man going around the corner headed in what\r\ndirection on what street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. On Patton Street. He was going south.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was going south on Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes; do you know Dootch Motors?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do I know Dootch Motors?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he on the east or the west side of Patton as he was\r\ngoing?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. On the east side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw him going on the east?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you see him go down Patton?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Just as far as the house would let the view go. In other\r\nwords, as soon as he went past the house, I couldn't see him any more.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, the first time that you saw him, what was his position?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He was standing, the first time I saw him. The man that\r\nshot him?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He was standing like I say, on the center in front of\r\nthe windshield, right directly on the right front fender of the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was not moving when you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; he wasn't moving then.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, after you saw him turn around the corner, what\r\ndid you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. After that, I set there for just a few minutes to kind\r\nof, I thought he went in back of the house or something. At the time, I\r\nthought maybe he might have lived in there and I didn't want to get out\r\nand rush right up. He might start shooting again.\r\n\r\nThat is when I got out of the truck and walked over to the policeman,\r\nand he was lying there and he had, looked like a big clot of blood\r\ncoming out of his head, and his eyes were sunk back in his head, and\r\njust kind of made me feel real funny. I guess I was really scared.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the policeman say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The policeman, I believe was dead when he hit the\r\nground, because he didn't put his hand out or nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the policeman as he fell, as you saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I saw him as he was falling. The door was about half\r\nway open, and he was right in front of the door, and just about in\r\nfront of the fender. I would say he was between the door and the front\r\nheadlight, about middleway when he started to fall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you notice where the gun of the policeman was?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The gun was in his hand and he was partially lying on\r\nhis gun in his right hand. He was partially lying on his gun and on his\r\nhand, too.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then I don't know if I opened the car door back further\r\nthan what it was or not, but anyway, I went in and pulled the radio\r\nand I mashed the button and told them that an officer had been shot,\r\nand I didn't get an answer, so I said it again, and this guy asked me\r\nwhereabouts all of a sudden, and I said, on 10th Street. I couldn't\r\nremember where it was at at the time.\r\n\r\nSo I looked up and I seen this number and I said 410 East 10th Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw a number on the house then?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Then he started to--then I don't know what he said; but\r\nI put the radio back. I mean, the microphone back up, and this other\r\nguy was standing there, so I got up out of the car, and I don't know, I\r\nwasn't sure if he heard me, and the other guy sat down in the car.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There was another passerby that stopped?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was he, do you know?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I couldn't tell you. I don't know who he was.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he driving a car or walking?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I don't know. He was just standing there whenever I\r\nlooked up. He was standing at the door of the car, and I don't know\r\nwhat he said to the officer or the phone, but the officer told him to\r\nkeep the line clear, or something, and stay off the phone, or something\r\nlike that. That he already knew about it.\r\n\r\nSo then I turned and walked off. I never did assist him after that at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. At the time I walked out, I guess I was scared, so I\r\nstarted across the street--alley between the two houses to my mother's\r\nhouse, and I got in the yard and I said I'd better go back, or just\r\ncaught myself until I got over there, I guess, so I went back around\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you went back, what did you do?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, was there anything up to that time that you saw there or\r\nthat you did that you haven't related here that you can think of right\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well. I started--I seen him throw the shells and I\r\nstarted to stop and pick them up, and I thought I'd better not so when\r\nI came back, after I had gotten back, I picked up the shells.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, you said you saw the man with the gun throw\r\nthe shells?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, did you see the man empty his gun?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That is what he was doing. He took one out and threw it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember in which hand he was holding his gun?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; I sure don't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember if he was trying to put anything in the gun\r\nalso?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes. As he turned the corner he was putting another\r\nshell in his gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw him?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I mean, he was acting like. I didn't see him actually\r\nput a shell in his gun, but he acted like he was trying to reload it.\r\n\r\nMaybe he was trying to take out another shell, but he could have been\r\nreloading it or something.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you now, I would like to have you relate again\r\nthe action of the man with the gun as you saw him now.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. As I saw him, I really--I mean really got a good view of\r\nthe man after the bullets were fired, he had just turned. He was just\r\nturning away.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he was pointing toward the officer, and he had just\r\nturned away to his left, and then he started. There was a big tree, and\r\nit seemed like he started back going to the curb of the street and into\r\nthe sidewalk, and then he turned and went down the sidewalk to, well,\r\nuntil he got in front of the corner house, and then he turned to the\r\nleft there and went on down Patton Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When he got in front of the corner, when you say he turned\r\nto his left, did he cut across the yard of the house, or did he go\r\nclear to the corner and turn off?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. There is a big bush and he catty-cornered across the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He kitty-cornered across the yard?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes. In other words, he didn't go all the way on the\r\nsidewalk. He just cut across the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he when you saw him throwing shells? Had he\r\nalready started across the yard?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, sir. He had just got back to the sidewalk when he\r\nthrew the first one and when he threw the second one, he had already\r\ncut back into the yard. He just sort of cut across.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you saw him throw two shells?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw where he threw the shells?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you later go back in that area and try and find the\r\nshells?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes. Well, right after that I went back and I knew\r\nexactly where they was at, and I went over and picked up one in my\r\nhand, not thinking and I dropped it, that maybe they want fingerprints\r\noff it, so I took out an empty pack of cigarettes I had and picked them\r\nup with a little stick and put them in this cigarette package; a chrome\r\nlooking shell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A chrome looking shell?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how long did it take you to locate the shells once you\r\nstarted looking for them?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Just a minute. I mean not very long at all. Just walked\r\ndirectly to them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw where he had thrown them?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. One of them went down inside of a bush, and the other\r\none was by the bush.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him after he turned the corner of the house?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know whether or not he threw any--you said you heard\r\nthree shots. Do you know whether or not he threw other shells there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look at all there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; I didn't bother to look there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him when he cut across the yard? Did he go\r\nbetween the bushes to get to the sidewalk on Patton Street, or do you\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Between the house and the bush; yes, sir. He had to cut\r\nacross the yard, because there was a big bush on the corner there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of about the man after you saw\r\nhim? What was he wearing? What did he look like?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, he was kind of, well, just about your size.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About my size? I am standing up.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. You are about 5' 10\"?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am between 5' 10\" and 5' 11\". Closer to 5' 11\", I believe.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I would say he was about your size, and he had a\r\nlight-beige jacket, and was lightweight.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did it have buttons or a zipper, or do you remember?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It seemed like it was a zipper-type jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What color was the trousers?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. They were dark.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what kind of shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It was dark in color, but I don't remember exactly what\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he average weight, slender, or heavy?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I would say he was average weight.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What color hair did he have?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Oh, dark. I mean not dark.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Black hair?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No. Not black or brown, just kind of a----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. My color hair?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say he is my size, my weight, and my color hair?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He kind of looks like--well, his hair was a little bit\r\ncurlier.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else about him that looked like me.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, that is all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about his skin? Was he fair complexioned or dark\r\ncomplexioned?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He wasn't dark.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Average complexion?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; a little bit darker than average.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. My complexion?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I wouldn't say that any more. I would say he is about\r\nyour complexion, sir. Of course he looked, his skin looked a little bit\r\nruddier than mine.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. His skin looked ruddier than mine?\r\n\r\nI might say for the record, that I was not in Dallas on November 22,\r\n1963.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, just your size.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he look like me?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; your face, not your face, but just your size.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Okay, well, I thank you. I was flying from St. Louis to Des\r\nMoines, Iowa, at about this time.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I remember the back of his head seemed like his hairline\r\nwas sort of--looked like his hairline sort of went square instead of\r\ntapered off, and he looked like he needed a haircut for about 2 weeks,\r\nbut his hair didn't taper off, it kind of went down and squared off and\r\nmade his head look flat in back.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you put these two shells that you found in this\r\ncigarette package, what did you do with them?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I gave them to an officer.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That came out to the scene shortly after?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember the name of the officer?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, sir; I didn't even ask him. I just told him that\r\nthis was the shells that he had fired, and I handed them to him. Seemed\r\nlike he was a young guy, maybe 24.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How old would you say the man that you saw with gun was?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I figured he was around 25.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When the officers came out there, did you tell them what you\r\nhad seen?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I left right after. I give the shells to the officer. I\r\nturned around and went back and we returned to work.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what happened? Did the officers ever get in touch with\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Later on that evening, about 4 o'clock, there was two\r\nofficers came by and asked for me, Mr. Callaway asked me--I had told\r\nthem that I had seen the officer, and the reporters were there and I\r\nwas trying to hide from the reporters because they will just bother you\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nThen I found out that they thought this was the guy that killed the\r\nPresident. At the time I didn't know the President was dead or he\r\nhad been shot. So I was just trying to hide from the reporters and\r\neverything, and these two officers came around and asked me if I'd seen\r\nhim, and I told him yes, and told them what I had seen, and they asked\r\nme if I could identify him, and I said I don't think I could.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was sure, I wasn't sure that I could or not. I wasn't\r\ngoing to say I could identify and go down and couldn't have.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he ever take you to the police station and ask you if\r\nyou could identify him?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; they didn't.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You used the name Oswald. How did you know this man was\r\nOswald?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. From the pictures I had seen. It looked like a guy,\r\nresembled the guy. That was the reason I figured it was Oswald.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were they newspaper pictures or television pictures, or\r\nboth, or neither?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, television pictures and newspaper pictures. The\r\nthing lasted about a month, I believe, it seemed like.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I showed--I believe they showed pictures of him every\r\nday for a long time there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you talk to anyone at all there that witnessed what was\r\ngoing on?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; sure didn't. There was people that asked me what\r\nhappened, came up in the crowd there and asked me what happened, and I\r\nsaid just the policeman got shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You talked to Ted Callaway, did you?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; afterward. You know, I told your--I told him, he\r\nasked me when we went, when Ted Callaway got around there, he opened\r\nthe car door and picked up the phone and called in and told them there\r\nwas an officer that had been killed. But the officer on the other side\r\nof the radio told him to hang up the phone to keep the lines clear, or\r\nsomething of that sort.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped out and ran around and he asked me did I see what\r\nhappened, and I said yes. And he said let's chase him, and I said no.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Why did you say \"No\"?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, he was reaching down and getting the gun out of\r\nthe policeman's hand, and I didn't think he should bother to go like\r\nthat. So he then turned around and went to the cab that was sitting on\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This cab?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes. There was a cab sitting--oh, there isn't a sidewalk\r\non Patton Street. I mean there is sidewalks, but not a curb, and this\r\ncab had pulled in there by the stop sign.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Which way was the cab headed on Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It was headed north on Patton Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it on the south side of 10th or the north side of 10th\r\nwhen it was parked there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It would be on the south side of 10th.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it on the east side of Patton or the west?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. It would be on the east side of Patton.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How close to the sidewalk on East 10th would the front part\r\nof the cab have been?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. The front part of the cab was, I would say, maybe 5 or 6\r\nfeet from the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. From the corner?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He was sort of, if it had been a curb there, he would be\r\nup on the curb.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. And so Ted then got in the taxicab and the taxicab came\r\nto a halt and he asked me which way he went. I told him he went down\r\nPatton Street toward the office, and come to find out later Ted had\r\nalready seen him go by there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Ted tell you later he had seen him go by?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes; then we had a colored porter that said he had seen\r\nhim go by.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this be Sam Guinyard?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Ted say whether or not he had gone down to the police\r\nstation to try to identify the man?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. After that--After I left that evening, I took off kind\r\nof early because I was so shookup that I couldn't work, and so when I\r\nsay early, I usually work to 9 or 10 or 11 o'clock, at night. So I'd\r\ntaken off early and the next day the kid told me that he went down\r\nthere. I think it was the next day, or the day after.\r\n\r\nWell, it was the next day he told me that they went down and identified\r\nhim as the guy that came by the carlot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Ted told you the next day at work that he had gone down and\r\nidentified him?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes; I don't know if Ted told me, but somebody told me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Ted worked at Dootch Motors at the same time?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What does he do there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. General manager.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Used-car place?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am going to go down and get some clothing and see if you\r\ncan identify it and I will be back in 1 minute.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Okay.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am handing you a jacket which has been marked as\r\n\"Commission's Exhibit 163,\" and ask you to state whether this bears any\r\nsimilarity to the jacket you saw this man with the gun wearing?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I would say this looks just like it. Looks like he had\r\nlaundried it, but it looks like it was a newer coat than that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I am handing you what has been marked \"Commission's Exhibit\r\n150,\" and see if this looks anything like the shirt that he had on?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I think the shirt looked darker than that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The shirt was darker?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I couldn't tell at the time because he had the jacket on\r\nthere. That was a waist-type jacket, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Yes; anything else you can think of.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Not offhand, except later on, I don't know if I seen\r\nit on television but I believe I seen it on television where they was\r\narresting him, the policeman from the theater. But it didn't seem like\r\nhe had a jacket on there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When he was being arrested you say he didn't have a jacket\r\non? Now at the time you saw him, did he have a jacket on?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. He had a jacket on and it looked like that jacket there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; I guess that is all I can think of right now.\r\n\r\nI think there was another car that was in front of me, a red Ford, I\r\nbelieve. I didn't know the man, but I guess he was about 25 or 30, and\r\nhe pulled over. I didn't never see him get out of his car, but when he\r\nheard the scare, I guess he was about six cars from them, and he pulled\r\nover, and I don't know if he came back there or not.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That would be all. I think if anybody had seen anything\r\nreally closeup, that he must have fired just as they got past him, and\r\nthey must have seen him standing there, because he was right directly\r\nin front of me. And whenever you see a squad car parked like that, you\r\nthink something is wrong. At least that is what comes to my mind.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That is all I can think of right now that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That is all I can think of right now that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You and I never met before today, did we, except that one\r\nday when we were around to see Ted Callaway and he introduced you at\r\nDootch Motors and we chatted for 3 or 4 minutes there?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes; you and two other men.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Today when we met, you came up here and what is the facts as\r\nto whether I asked you before the court reporter was able to get here\r\nto just relate to me what happened, or did I start questioning you or\r\ntry to tell you things as I saw them?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. So; you just asked me what happened and I described to\r\nyou what happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything you said before the court reporter got\r\nhere that is different in anyway that you said after the court reporter\r\nstarted taking your testimony?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Maybe now only in the change of time, or I imagine I\r\nadded a little bit since she was here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything that would be at variance with what you\r\ntold me before the court reporter got here?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Well, I don't understand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What I mean is, is there anything that you said before the\r\ncourt reporter got here that you haven't included after the court\r\nreporter got here?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything you have said in front of the court reporter\r\nthat has been different insofar as being a fact which is opposite or\r\ndifferent in anyway from what you told me before?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Different in wording but----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But are the facts different?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. No; I don't believe the facts are different.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you have a right, if you want to, to come back and\r\nread the deposition and sign it, or you can just rely on the court\r\nreporter's accuracy and waive the signing of it. Do you want to waive\r\nit or not?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. I would like to read it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Maybe I could add something I didn't add.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, I will ask the court reporter to try and get in\r\ntouch with you.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. 3112 June Drive.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. She can reach you at Dootch Motors?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Dootch Motors.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is the address?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. 501 East Jefferson.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You did get notice of the taking of this deposition here\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are here voluntarily appearing in front of the\r\nCommission?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, we surely appreciate all of the cooperation you have\r\nshown here, sir, and if there is anything else that you think is\r\nimportant, we would appreciate your getting in touch with us.\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That is the reason I wanted to read this, in case I\r\nmight have left out something.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you please thank whoever is the general manager at\r\nDootch Motors for letting you come here and appear before us?\r\n\r\nMr. BENAVIDES. That is Mr. Harris.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF MRS. CHARLIE VIRGINIA DAVIS\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mrs. Charlie Virginia Davis was taken at 9 a.m., on\r\nApril 2, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney. 301 Post Office\r\nBuilding, Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W.

Well, after I got married we moved to Dallas and we lived\r\nthere ever since.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got married, you moved to Dallas.

Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know what cross-street runs at 10th there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Patton.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. 10th and Patton?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What kind of house did you live in? Was it a brick or frame\r\nhome?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was a frame apartment house.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was a frame apartment house.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. A frame apartment house. You and your husband lived in one\r\napartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. And my sister and her husband lived in another one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. There were two apartments there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. On the bottom floor.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What is your sister's name?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know what her husband's name is?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Troy Lee Davis.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Taking you back to the afternoon of November 22, do you\r\nremember anything out of the ordinary that happened on that date?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, the boy that was known as Lee Harvey Oswald shot J.\r\nD. Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, now, did you see him shoot J. D. Tippit?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No; we didn't see. Yes; we heard the shot. He had already\r\nshot him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say you heard a shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where were you when you heard the shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I was over at my sister-in-law's.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Her apartment?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where in her apartment were you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I was in the living room.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were in the living room?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes. We was lying down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were lying down in the living room on the sofa bed, or\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It is a bed against the wall and a sofa.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who was lying down?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, Jeanette was lying on the bed. I was lying on the\r\ncouch, and Annette and James Lee were lying on the other bed.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are these other people children of your sister's?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how old are those children?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. James will be 6 and then Annette is 5.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now as you were lying down, what did you see or hear?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We just heard a shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How many shots did you hear?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We heard the first one and then we thought maybe someone\r\nhad a blowout like a tire or something and we didn't get up to see.\r\nThen we heard the second shot and that is when we ran to the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, now, does that mean that you heard two shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Are you sure there were not more than two, or are you sure\r\nthat you heard two?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We just heard two.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, Mrs. Markham was trying to say----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Markham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you know what her first name is?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir. I just know her by Mrs. Markham.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you ever known her before?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How did you know it was Mrs. Markham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, it said in the paper that it was Mrs. Markham, and\r\nmy sister-in-law said it was Mrs. Markham. My sister-in-law knows Mrs.\r\nMarkham.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you heard the shots. You heard, you say, the second shot\r\nand then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We was already up. We ran to the door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By we, who do you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Jeanette and I.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You went to which door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be the front of the house facing East 10th Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Mrs. Markham was standing at the tree.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. If we can picture the street intersection, was she standing\r\nin the middle of the street or on the sidewalk?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She was on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Let me ask you this. Your house would be located at the\r\nsoutheast corner of the intersection, is that where it is, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would she be standing on a corner that would be right across\r\n10th Street but on the same side of Patton, or across Would it be\r\ncatty-cornered or would it be across 10th Street but on the other side?\r\nMaybe we can draw it here on a little paper.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I don't remember it too good.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now I have drawn on a piece of paper here a street\r\nintersection and this is Patton and here is 400 East 10th, which would\r\nbe your house. Do you want to mark here where you think you saw Mrs.\r\nMarkham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, she was standing on the sidewalk right here. Do you\r\nwant to put an \"X\" there?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Please put an \"X\" there.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. (Marks \"X\".)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I'm going to call that Virginia Davis Deposition, Exhibit 1.\r\nWhat was Mrs. Markham saying, or did you hear her say anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We heard her say \"He shot him. He is dead. Call the police.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was she saying this in a soft or loud voice?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She was screaming it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anything else as you heard her screaming?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we saw Oswald. We didn't know it was Oswald at the\r\ntime. We saw that boy cut across the lawn emptying the shells out of\r\nthe gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, you saw a boy. Do you know how old he was?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He didn't look like he was over 20.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what color hair he had?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Let's see, the best I recall, he had sort of light brown.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Light brown hair?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he tall or short or average height?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was about average height.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Fat, thin, or average weight?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Slim.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Slim.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He had on a light-brown-tan jacket.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what color his trousers were?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I think they were black. Brown jacket and trousers.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The trousers were black?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what kind of shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; I don't recall that.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the jacket open or closed up?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was open.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But you don't remember what kind of shirt he had on?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he look at you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; not that I remember. I don't think so.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And where was he when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was cutting across our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In what direction was he walking?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was walking----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Away from Patton or towards Patton?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Towards Patton.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you first saw him, had he gotten up to your yard yet or\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; he was cutting over across our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was cutting across your walk that leads up to the front\r\ndoor?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far from the main sidewalk on East 10th was he?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was about 3 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About 3 feet or so?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; when I first saw him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then he was cutting across your sidewalk about 3 feet away\r\nfrom the main sidewalk?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then did you see him--how long did you see him? Where did\r\nyou see him go?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw him go around the corner of our house.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How far did you see him go?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, when he disappeared around that corner, that is the\r\nlast we saw of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him go through any bushes by your house or not?\r\nOr didn't you see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean you didn't see him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw him when he cut across our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he when you last saw him? He was--was he still in\r\nyour yard, or was he on the sidewalk on Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was still in our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We already called the police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You called the police before you saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. When Mrs. Markham was standing across the street hollering,\r\nshe told us to call the police, so Jeanette and I went in there, and\r\nJeanette called the police and we went back and he was cutting across\r\nour yard, and we gave him time to go on because we were afraid he might\r\nshoot us.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you call the police before or after you saw him cut\r\nacross your yard?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, to your--to the best of your recollection,\r\nyou heard the shots, you ran outside, you saw Mrs. Markham--did you see\r\nanything else when you saw Mrs. Markham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; we just saw a police car sitting on the side of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the police car parked?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was parked between the hedge that marks the apartment\r\nhouse where he lives in and the house next door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it on your side of East 10th or the other side of the\r\nstreet?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was on our side, the same side that we lived on.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it headed as you looked to the police car, towards your\r\nright or towards your left?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any police officer in a police car when you\r\nfirst saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When your sister went to call the police, did you go with\r\nher, or did you stay by the front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I went with her.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you hear your sister do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, she called the police and told whoever answered the\r\nphone that there had been a murder out in front of our house, to come\r\nquick.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did she do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She hung up and then we went back to the front door and\r\ntold the two kids to stay indoors.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Then we went out in the front yard and right down to the\r\npolice car and that is when we saw the policeman lying on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the policeman lying?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was lying just, well, he was half between the front end\r\nof his car and, well, his head was lying toward the front end of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he on the driver's side of the front or on the other\r\nside?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was on the driver's side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, now, as I understand your testimony, after you\r\nmade the call, you went out to the front yard, is that it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You then went out to see the policeman in the street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you went out in the front yard, were you in the front\r\nyard when the man was going by there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; he had already gone when we went outside.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He had already gone when you went outside?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I thought you said that when you went outside you went on\r\nthe sidewalk?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. See, all the people had already--see, he was already gone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had he gone by at that time?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. By the time we got back from off the phone, he had already\r\ngone. He had already disappeared behind the corner of our house.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him going in front of your house before you\r\ncalled on the phone?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes. When we heard the second shot, we ran to the front\r\ndoor, and that is when we saw the boy cutting across the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, let me see if I understand your statement now. You\r\nwent to the front door after you heard the second shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the front door? Did you open\r\nthe front door, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; we just looked through the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You looked through the front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was there a screen door on it or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was a screen door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you looking through the screen door, or was the screen\r\ndoor partially open, if you remember.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was closed. We was looking through it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were looking through the screen door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were you in front of your sister-in-law, or was she in front\r\nof you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She was in front of me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You were both looking through the screen door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see when you looked through the screen door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw a boy walking, cutting across our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was he when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was about 3 feet from the sidewalk. Not the one that\r\ncomes up to our front door, but the other sidewalk.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was about 3 feet from the front sidewalk on East 10th?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had he come up to your sidewalk yet that comes up from East\r\n10th to your front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, he had already. He was about half on the concrete, I\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was half on that concrete?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you watch this man do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We watched him unload the shells out of his gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What hand was he holding this gun in?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. In the right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was holding the gun in his right hand, if you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What was he doing with his left hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was emptying the shells in his left hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was the gun broken open, so to speak? In other words. I\r\ndon't know if you have ever seen a capgun. When you want to load the\r\ncapgun, you have to kind of break it apart on a hinge.\r\n\r\nWas the gun broken apart like that, or was the barrel straight?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was like the real gun, little one.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What do you mean it was just like?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was just as best as I can remember, it was a little\r\npistol, and he was emptying the shells. Where the shell was coming out,\r\nhe was emptying the shells into his left hand.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see what he did with the shells when he emptied them\r\ninto his left hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. After we, well, he was dropping them on the ground because\r\nwe found two.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You said that you found two? Did you see him drop them on\r\nthe ground or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No; we didn't see him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You just saw him emptying shells in his hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You didn't actually see what he did with them when he got\r\nthem in his hand, did you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head no?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you see the man do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, he just cut across. He disappeared from behind the\r\ncorner of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Going toward what street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, going toward Jefferson Street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. He was headed on Patton in the direction toward Jefferson?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see him actually get to Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; he was already around the corner.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw him go around the corner of your home?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do or see then?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we just went out, because we had already called the\r\npolice, notified them, and we went out in the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You notified the police. Let me ask you this. Did you notify\r\nthe police before or after you saw the boy with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Let's see, I think it was before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you say before, what do you mean?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, before we saw the boy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before you saw the boy you notified the police?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, let me try and reconstruct your actions then. You\r\nheard the shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You ran to the door?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see when you got to the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we just saw, you know, the police car parked down\r\nthere and we wondered what was going on, so we heard Mrs. Markham\r\nacross the street calling.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, she told us to call the police, well, so went to the\r\nhouse. We was already in the house, and we went to the phone and called\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Then we went back to the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw the boy cutting across the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do or see?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. After he disappeared around the corner we ran out in the\r\nfront yard and down to see what had happened.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then is that when you saw the policeman?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I saw the policeman lying on the street.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Did you see or do anything else? Did you see\r\nanyone else that you know come up to the policeman?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No sir; there was a lot of people around there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember about what time of day this was?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I wouldn't say for sure. But it was about 1:30, between\r\n1:30 and 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, after this, did police come out there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; they was already there.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. By the time you got out there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we just stood out there and watched. You know, tried\r\nto see how it all happened. But we saw part of it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We stood out there until after the ambulance had come and\r\npicked him up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. And we stood out there and talked to this woman who told us\r\nthat President Kennedy was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. This woman had told us that President Kennedy was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. When the police cars was circling all the blocks, about\r\nfour or five blocks to see if they could find the boy, and we stayed\r\nout there all that time to see if they would locate him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, did you tell the police, that you had seen anyone\r\nwith a gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir; we told them that we saw a boy carrying a gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, that was----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you ever go down to the police station or identify him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir; we had to identify him in the lineup.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What day was that? This same day or another day?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Same day.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About what time of the day was it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was probably about 5:30.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Who went down with you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, let's see, my sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That would be Barbara Jeanette Davis?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir; and her husband Troy Lee and myself.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the police station?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We stayed there until this detective, some man walked up to\r\nus and led us to this dark room.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before they led you to the dark room, did he show you any\r\npictures of anyone?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you seen any pictures on television of anyone that might\r\nbe the man you saw walking with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you watched television at all?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No; we didn't watch television.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had you seen any newspapers that afternoon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; we didn't get the newspapers until that following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you went with the detective to a dark room?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the dark room?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He told us to sit down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. And then these five boys, or men walked up on this\r\nplatform, and he was No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say he was No. 2. Who was No. 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The boy that shot Tippit.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean the man--did you see him shoot Tippit? Or you mean\r\nthe man you saw with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The man I saw carrying the gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was he white or a Negro man?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was white.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Were all the men in the lineup white men or some Negroes?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. All of them were white.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Could you describe any other people in the lineup as to\r\nwhether they might be fat or thin or short or tall?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, one of them was sort, well, he was tall and slim.\r\nAnd then the other one there, he was sort of chubby and he was short.\r\nThen this other one, he was about the same height as the other one,\r\nthe last one I told you about, short and chubby. And the other one was\r\nabout--medium tall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now you identified someone in that lineup?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear your sister-in-law identify him first, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; I identified him first.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was your sister when you identified him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She was sitting right next to me.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. How did you identify him? Did you yell that this is the man\r\nI saw?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No; I just leaned over and told the detective it was No. 2.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was the detective? Was he to your right or to your\r\nleft?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Let's see, to my right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where was your sister, to your right or to your left?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. As she was to your right, so you leaned over to the\r\ndetective and told the detective it was No. 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else that you can think of that happened that day?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Later did you ever see a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald on\r\ntelevision?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you first see it on television?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. When they was bringing him out of the jail out here.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. When they were bringing him out of the jail.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean Sunday when he got shot?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did this look, could you tell whether this was the same man\r\nyou saw running with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I wouldn't say for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You mean from seeing his picture on television?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the man you identified as No. 2? Would you say\r\nfor sure that he was the man you saw running with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I would say that was him for sure.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What you are saying is that you couldn't necessarily tell\r\nfrom the television picture?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir. Our television was blurred anyway, so we couldn't\r\nhardly tell.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember that you signed a statement when you were\r\ndown at the Dallas Police Department at all, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Virginia Davis\r\nDeposition, Exhibit 2, and ask you to state if this is your signature\r\non here?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would you read the contents of your deposition Exhibit 2,\r\nand I will ask you if there is anything there that is inaccurate.\r\n\r\n(Reads statement.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have read Exhibit 2?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything in that statement that is inaccurate in\r\nany way?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is that what you told the police of Dallas on November 22,\r\n1963?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now on this statement it says that you heard a shot and then\r\nanother shot and ran to the side door at Patton Street. Was that the\r\nside door or front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"I saw the boy cutting across our yard and he\r\nwas unloading his gun.\" Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"We walked outside and a woman was hollering,\r\n'He's dead, he's dead, he's shot.'\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"This woman told Jeanette to call the police\r\nand she did.\" Is that what happened?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It says, \"I saw the officer that had been shot lying on 10th\r\nStreet after Jeanette had called the police.\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now it says, \"Jeanette found a empty shell that the man had\r\nunloaded and gave it to the police.\" Did you see Jeanette find that\r\nshell?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes. I was right along behind her.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Where did she find it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She found it beside, well, the apartment was facing this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Facing Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir. And we was already outside. We thought maybe we\r\ncould find some evidence for the police. So we went through the hedge,\r\nand by my front door of the apartment where we live, right there in the\r\ngrass where he dropped them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Had the police started to search around your house yet when\r\nthey found it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; they already started to search.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Would this have been to the side of the house or the corner\r\nof the house that you found, that Jeanette found that shell?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was by the side.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This would have been by the side of the house that is next\r\nto Patton Street?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About how far from the front of the house would it be?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was about 5 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About 5 feet. You saw Jeanette find the shell? You saw her\r\npick it up from the ground?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What color was it, do you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The best I can recall, it was gray, one of these----\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The best you can recall, it was gray?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did Jeanette do with it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She gave it to some detective.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see her find any other shells?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I found one after Jeanette, after all the police had gone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When did you find yours?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was about 10 minutes after all the police had gone.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that before or after you went down to the police station?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. About when before?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, I would say it was about 2:30, or 4.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Mrs. Davis, when did you say you found this other shell?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was about 4.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see or know of anyone else finding any other shell?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what you did with your shell when you found\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, before I picked it up, this boy told me that was\r\nwalking along with us helping us find, see if we could find anything\r\nfor evidence, he told me the police would get me if I picked it up by\r\nmy fingers, and take fingerprints, and I got scared and ran to the\r\nhouse and got a Kleenex tissue and brought back outside and wrapped the\r\nshell in.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do with it when you wrapped the shell up?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Jeanette took it and put it in her apartment up on the\r\nmantle-board.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Then about 5:30 the same day the police called and wanted\r\nus to come down and identify him in the lineup.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do with the shell?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I gave it to the police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you give it to him at your house or down at the police\r\nstation?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. They come and picked us up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You gave it to the officer that came to pick you up?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember what his name was, or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now in your statement, Virginia Davis Deposition Exhibit 2,\r\nnow you state that, \"Jeanette found an empty shell that the man had\r\nunloaded and gave it to the police. After the police had left I found a\r\nempty shell in our yard.\" Is this the same shell you gave to Detective\r\nDhority? Does the name Detective Dhority sound familiar to you now, or\r\ndon't you remember?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I never did hear the detective called.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I didn't hear the detective's name called.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say, \"The man that was unloading the gun was the same\r\nman that I saw tonight as No. 2 man in a lineup.\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mrs. Davis, on this statement, Virginia Davis\r\nDeposition Exhibit 2, it states that \"We heard a shot and then another\r\nshot and ran to side door at Patton Street.\" You say that should have\r\nbeen the front door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That was supposed to be the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say, \"I saw the boy cutting across our yard and he was\r\nunloading his gun. We walked outside and a woman was hollering, 'he's\r\ndead, he's, he's shot'.\" \"This woman told Jeanette to call the police\r\nand she did.\" Now according to this statement, you saw the man cutting\r\nacross your yard before you called the police?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now this statement is wrong, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It is your testimony now, as I understand it, that you went\r\nback in the house and you called the police, and then you went back\r\noutside the house and saw the boy cutting across the yard?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. That is your statement now?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now I hand you what is Deposition Exhibit 3, and ask you to\r\nstate if your signature appears on Deposition Exhibit 3?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This appears to be an affidavit dated December 1, 1963, and\r\nI would like you to read the statement if you would.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. (Reads statement.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You have now had an opportunity to read over Virginia Davis\r\nDeposition Exhibit 3, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything on that statement that is not accurate?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. As I recall, this is all right on that statement.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I recall that is all right on that statement.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything on that statement that is not accurate, to\r\nthe best of your knowledge?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head no?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Not that I recall.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, in this statement it says that you and your\r\nsister-in-law were lying on the bed with the two children when you\r\nheard a loud bang, and immediately following the first report there was\r\nanother loud bang and you jumped up and ran to the front door? Is that\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"When we got to the door and went out on the\r\nporch, I saw a man who I later that day identified at the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment.\" Is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, according to this statement, you saw the man when you\r\nfirst got to the door and went out on the porch? Now, did you see him\r\nthen, or did you see him----\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw him cut across after he had shot the policeman. We\r\nsaw him cut across our yard, and that is the last we saw of him.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Well, now, you actually didn't see him shoot the policeman,\r\ndid you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw----just saw the man with the gun?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I just saw the man with the gun cutting across the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After you heard some shots?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. After I heard the two shots.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, about how soon after you heard the two shots did you\r\nget to the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we didn't even put on our shoes. We just run to the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was it a matter of seconds or a matter of minutes?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. A matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got there, you opened the door, and what did you\r\nsee?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw this boy or man cut across the yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, and he had a revolver in his hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In his right hand or left hand?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. In his right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. This statement goes on to say that \"The man had a revolver\r\nin his left hand and was shaking the shells out of it into his right\r\nhand.\" Is that right or wrong?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Wrong.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was the other way around?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was the other way around.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got to the door and you opened the door, and what did\r\nyou see now?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw this boy cut across our yard unloading the shells\r\nout of his gun.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Mrs. Markham, this woman, was standing across the street\r\nhollering to us to call the police. So we went back in there and called\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right. Now, this statement says, goes on to say, \"This\r\nman was coming across the yard and was almost to the walk which leads\r\ndirectly to the porch and is in a direct line with the front door.\"\r\n\r\nIs that where the man was when you first saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"The man had a revolver in his left hand and was shaking the\r\nshells out of it into his right hand.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was the other way, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. But you say \"The man had a revolver in his left hand and was\r\nshaking the shells out of it into his right hand. As the man passed\r\ndirectly in front of us, he looked up for a second or so and then\r\ncontinued on across the yard to Patton Street in a normal walk.\" Was he\r\nwalking or running when you saw him?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. He was walking.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did he look up at you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIS. Pardon?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, you just remember kind of seeing him from a side\r\nview?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"At about this time, a woman directly across the\r\nintersection from our house yelled out, 'He's dead, he's dead, he shot\r\nhim.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"The man glanced up at the woman and kept on walking.\" Did\r\nyou see the man glance up at Mrs. Markham when she was yelling?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; we saw when he looked over at Mrs. Markham.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see Mrs. Markham do anything when he looked at her?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No; she was over there just hollering and screaming.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see her raise her hand to her face in any way?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir. She raised both her hands to her face.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw her do that?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see her do anything else?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You say, \"He walked around the corner of the house that\r\nfaces Patton Street and out of sight.\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"Barbara Davis and I returned to the house where she called\r\nthe police.\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. According to the statement then, it says that your sister\r\nBarbara Jeanette called the police after you saw the man, is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"After she called the police, we went back out on the porch\r\nbut by then the man we had seen with the gun was no longer in sight.\"\r\n\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"When the police arrived we searched the area\r\non the side of the house that faces Patton Street, and Barbara found a\r\ngunshell that had been fired.\" It that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That's right.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. \"After the police left we again searched the area and I\r\nagain found a gunshell that had been fired. I later turned this shell\r\nover to the Dallas Police Department.\" Is that right?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then it says, \"I have been given an opportunity to make\r\nadditions and corrections on this statement, and it is true to the best\r\nof my knowledge and belief.\"\r\n\r\nDid they give you an opportunity to make additions and corrections on\r\nthe statement?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. They did not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did they read the statement back to you?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Not that I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. They may have but you don't remember.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. May have but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mrs. Davis, you and I never talked about this matter\r\nuntil the court reporter started taking your testimony, have we?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I never met you before, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Have you ever talked with any person in connection with the\r\nPresident's Commission before we started taking your testimony here?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I want to be certain that we get this time sequence correct\r\nas to when you saw the man with the gun and when the police were\r\ncalled, so I am just going to ask you to sit for about 30 seconds and\r\njust think as to just what did happen, and then just tell the court\r\nreporter in your own words just what did happen there.\r\n\r\n(Three minutes of silence.)\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now, Mrs. Davis, you may not be able to remember just what\r\nexactly the time sequence was. You have been sitting here about 3\r\nminutes, and if you don't remember what the time sequence was, why I\r\nwould like to have you so state. But if you do remember--or do you want\r\nmore time to think about it?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, the best I can remember, it was before that we saw\r\nthe boy cut across the yard that we called the police, the best that I\r\ncan remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. In other words, it is your testimony, as I understand it\r\nnow, that you heard the shot, and then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We heard the second shot and we ran to the front door.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you see?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw this boy cut across the yard, and we had seen this\r\nwoman was coming home from work, she had on a uniform, that was Mrs.\r\nMarkham--we didn't know it was at the time, but she saw all that happen.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What did you do when you got to the door?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We saw the boy cut across our yard.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. At the time you got to the door, did you also see Mrs.\r\nMarkham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see both at approximately the same time? I will ask\r\nyou whom did you see first, Mrs. Markham, or the boy cutting across the\r\nyard?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The boy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You saw the boy first?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That is who we saw first.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then you saw Mrs. Markham second?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the boy say anything?\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did Mrs. Markham say anything?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, when she got across the other street, 10th, she\r\nhollered, \"He's dead, he's dead, he shot him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did she say?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. She was screaming. I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Then what did you do?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Well, we called the police. Notified them.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. So you called the police after you saw the boy?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. After we saw the boy.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. And Mrs. Markham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head yes. Is that your testimony, to\r\nthe best of your recollection?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. That is my testimony.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. I want to ask you again, did you call the police before or\r\nafter you saw the boy?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. It was after.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was after?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir; after, the best that I can remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. The best you can remember, you called the police before or\r\nafter you saw the boy?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Before or after?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. After.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. After you saw the boy, you went back in the house and called\r\nthe police?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Is there anything else that you can think of that we haven't\r\ntalked about that might be helpful in this investigation?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see any ambulance come up to where Officer Tippit\r\nwas?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; I saw the ambulance.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You got there before the ambulance, did you not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes; we got there before.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did the ambulance get there first or the police get there\r\nfirst?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The ambulance got there first.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see anyone making any calls over Tippit's radio?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got to Tippit's car, did you take a look at that\r\npolice car?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. We didn't touch it.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you look at it? Did you notice whether its windows were\r\nrolled up or rolled down?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. The one on his side was rolled down.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. What about the one on the passenger side of the front seat,\r\ndid you notice that?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Rolled up.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Was that rolled up?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. When you got there?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head yes.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Now the front window has kind of a little window in it.\r\nDo you know that little tiny part of the front window that opens and\r\ncloses?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Do you remember whether that one on the front seat by the\r\nright side of the front seat was open or not?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. It was not open? Or you don't----\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. I don't remember.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you hear anyone make any statements that they had seen\r\nanything other than Mrs. Markham?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Did you see a taxicab parked anywhere in the vicinity?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. You are nodding your head no.\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. Anything else you can think of?\r\n\r\nMrs. DAVIS. No, sir; I think I have told it all.\r\n\r\nMr. BELIN. All right, Mrs. Davis, we want to thank you very much for\r\ntaking the time and the effort to come here. I know that this whole\r\nepisode has taken time on your part, and we certainly appreciate your\r\ncooperation with the President's Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nMisspellings in quoted evidence not changed; misspellings that could be\r\ndue to mispronunciations were not changed.\r\n\r\nSome simple typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.\r\n\r\nOccasional uses of \"Mr.\" for \"Mrs.\" and of \"Mrs.\" for \"Mr.\" corrected.\r\n\r\nDubious repeated words, (e.g., \"What took place by way of of\r\nconversation?\") retained.\r\n\r\nSeveral unbalanced quotation marks not remedied.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be question marks not changed.\r\n\r\nOccasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be\r\nperiods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at\r\nthe end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at\r\nthe beginning of a line).
