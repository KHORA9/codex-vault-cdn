Without\r\nstrength--and by strength I mean health, vitality, and a general sense\r\nof physical well-being--life is but a gloomy business. Wealth, talent,\r\nambition, the love and affection of friends, the pleasure derived\r\nfrom doing good to those about one, all these things may afford some\r\nconsolation for being deprived of life’s chief blessing, but they\r\ncan never make up for it. “But,” I am constantly being asked, “it is\r\nall very well for you to say this, and everyone of sense agrees with\r\nyou; the point is, can we obtain this much-prized blessing?” In the\r\nvast majority of cases I can say unhesitatingly “Yes.” You can all\r\nbe strong, all enjoy the heritage which was intended for you. Not\r\nall to the same extent, perhaps. Those who are afflicted with some\r\nhereditary disease, who may have unsound organs handed down to them,\r\ncannot reasonably expect to get such results as their more fortunate\r\nbrethren. Still, even they need not despair; even if their condition\r\nbe such as to put out of the question any such thing as athletics,\r\nthey can, at all events, attain to such a condition as will permit of\r\ntheir enjoying life, and render them fit to carry on their work without\r\ndifficulty. And after all, those who wish to be strong for this reason\r\nare innumerable. It is only the young and vigorous who desire to excel\r\nin athletic pastimes, but the middle-aged and elderly, the delicate\r\nwomen and young children, who yearn for health are countless. I claim\r\nthat by carefully following out my system, as set out in the following\r\npages, and fully illustrated in the Anatomical Chart at the end of the\r\nvolume, these results may be attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is nearly two years since the first edition of “Strength and How\r\nto Obtain it” was published, and its success has been very gratifying\r\nto me. It plainly demonstrates that the people of my adopted country\r\nare gradually beginning to understand and appreciate what is meant\r\nby “physical culture,” and that my ideas are steadily taking root in\r\nproductive ground. I am, therefore, encouraged to bring out a new\r\nedition of the book, which, I trust, will be an improvement upon its\r\npredecessor. Several chapters have been added and a few inaccuracies\r\nand ambiguities remedied, and I trust the book in its new form will\r\nfind favour with my readers. I wish to draw particular attention to\r\nchapters V. and VIII., in which I refer to “My ‘Grip’ Dumb-bell” and\r\nto “Physical Culture for Women.” There are various other additions to\r\nwhich I need not refer here. Sufficient to say that during the past\r\neighteen months I have learned much, and that so far as lies in my\r\npower I have endeavoured to give the benefit of such knowledge as I\r\nhave acquired to all who believe with me that the cultivation of the\r\nbody is a sacred and imperative duty.\r\n\r\n  EUGEN SANDOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n                    MY SYSTEM OF PHYSICAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STRENGTH\r\n\r\n                                  AND\r\n\r\n                           HOW TO OBTAIN IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCONCERNING PHYSICAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is curious to me to look back a year or two and to reflect upon the\r\nchange in public opinion upon this subject which has taken place in\r\nso short a time. When I first began to preach the “gospel of health\r\nand strength” the general tendency was to make fun of me. Some people\r\ncalled me a fool; others, a charlatan. Very few indeed took the\r\ntrouble to see whether there was anything in my theories, and to test\r\nfor themselves their truth or falsity. That was, so to speak, only\r\nyesterday; what an alteration, and an alteration for the better, is to\r\nbe observed to-day. I shall not be accused of undue egotism if I say\r\nthat my ideas have “caught on.” All over the country, among the young,\r\n“physical culture” is now the rage, and that it is no mere passing\r\nfancy is proved by the fact that those who are no longer in their first\r\nyouth are its equally devoted, though possibly less feverish, disciples.\r\n\r\n“And what is physical culture?” is naturally the question which arises\r\nto the lips of those to whom the subject is still unfamiliar. Let me\r\nbegin by saying what it _is not_. To begin with, to suppose, as many\r\npeople do suppose, that athletics and physical culture are the same\r\nthing is quite a mistaken notion. Then is physical culture opposed to\r\nathletics? Certainly not. Cricket and football and rowing and swimming,\r\nand, indeed, all forms of manly sport and exercise, are admirable\r\nthings in their way, but they are not physical culture. A part of it,\r\nif you like; but physical culture is something far wider in its scope,\r\ninfinitely loftier in its ideals.\r\n\r\nWhat was the ideal of the Greeks? They were ardent athletes, but their\r\npastimes were only regarded as a means to an end. The Greeks regarded\r\nthe culture of the body as a sacred duty; their aim was to bring it to\r\nthe highest possible state of power and beauty, and we know how they\r\nsucceeded. Surely what they succeeded in doing cannot be impossible for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nDoes the reader now begin to get a clearer idea of what is meant\r\nby physical culture? As I have previously said, it is to the body\r\nwhat culture, in the accepted sense of the word, is to the mind. To\r\nconstantly and persistently cultivate the whole of the body so that at\r\nlast it shall be capable of anything that sound organs and perfectly\r\ndeveloped muscles can accomplish--that is physical culture. The\r\nproduction, in short, of an absolutely perfect body--that is physical\r\nculture. To undo the evil for which civilization, and all the drawbacks\r\nit has brought in its train, have been responsible in making man regard\r\nhis body lightly--that is the aim of physical culture. I think I am\r\njustified in saying that while it embraces every variety of athletics\r\nit goes very much further.\r\n\r\nPossibly there are people who will refuse to admit that this aim is\r\nin itself a desirable one. They may say that the sound body is only\r\nvaluable in so far as it enables the sound mind to perform its work.\r\nThis I regard as nonsensical cant. I absolutely and strenuously refuse\r\nto allow for an instant that the cultivation of the body is, _per se_,\r\na comparatively valueless thing. On the contrary, I maintain that he\r\nwho neglects his body--and not to cultivate it _is_ to neglect it--is\r\nguilty of the worst sin; for he sins against Nature. I take my stand\r\nupon this then--that the care of the body is in itself an absolutely\r\ngood thing, and its neglect is no more to be excused than is the\r\nneglect of the opportunities of mental advancement which have been\r\nplaced in a man’s way. I am quite aware that it takes a very long time\r\nto thoroughly free ourselves from the trammels of old-established\r\nprejudice. I am quite prepared to hear of some worthy folk gravely\r\nshaking their heads and deprecating any great amount of attention being\r\npaid to the body as likely to engender undue vanity and self-esteem. I\r\ndo not think that is likely to be so, but even if it should be the case\r\nI do not hold it to be such a grievous matter. If a man has striven his\r\nutmost to make the best of himself a certain amount of pride in the\r\nfact may well be forgiven him. Or, at all events, we can look upon his\r\nfailing with the eye of charity.\r\n\r\n       ———————————————\r\n\r\nI do not think I can conclude this chapter better than by reprinting\r\nsome remarks on the subject which I wrote in the first number of\r\n“Physical Culture,” my monthly magazine. The article was carefully\r\nthought out, and I do not think there is any need for me to add to it.\r\n“For after all, why should not a man feel some pride in a healthy and\r\nwell-cared-for body? Though I contend that it in itself is emphatically\r\na good thing, that is not to say the effects of physical culture are\r\nconfined to the body. In bringing the body to its highest pitch of\r\nperfection, various moral qualities, the value of which it would be\r\ndifficult to over-estimate, must necessarily be brought into play. The\r\nfirst essential to success is the power of concentrating the will upon\r\nthe work. Muscles are not developed by muscular action alone. Physical\r\nexertion, however arduous and long continued, will not make a man\r\nstrong, or the day labourer and the blacksmith would be the strongest\r\nof men. Mechanical and desultory exertion will never materially\r\nincrease a man’s strength. He must first learn the great secret, which\r\nought to be no secret at all. He must use his mind. He may not be able\r\nto add a cubit to his stature, but by taking thought a man can most\r\nassuredly increase the size of his muscles, strengthen all his organs,\r\nand add to his general vitality. But he must put his mind, as well as\r\nhis muscles, into the work. And by exercise and practice the will-power\r\nis greatly increased, until, in course of time, the whole organism\r\nis so absolutely under its control that the muscles can be kept in\r\nperfect condition even without what, in ordinary language, is called\r\n“exercise.” That is to say, that without violent exertion, but merely\r\nby the exertion of the will, the muscles can be exercised almost to\r\nany extent. Can it for a moment be supposed that this cultivation of\r\nthe will-power is not of great value to an individual, no matter what\r\nsort of task or work he may be engaged in? Is it not largely by the\r\nexercise of will-power that most things are achieved? Take two men of\r\nequal talents; give them equal opportunities; but let one’s will-power\r\nand power of concentration be relatively much greater than his\r\nfellow’s. Then set them to perform the same task. Which will succeed\r\nbest? No person endowed with ordinary intelligence can be in doubt for\r\na moment. Will-power is a mighty factor--perhaps the mightiest--in\r\nall that goes to make up the sum of human success or failure. But the\r\nstrengthening of will--though perhaps the chief--is not by a long way\r\nthe only benefit which physical culture confers. The man who means to\r\nmake his body as nearly perfect as possible must perforce cultivate\r\nhabits of self-control and of temperance. Not the temperance which\r\nconsists of rigidly abstaining from all the ‘pleasant vices,’ but the\r\n_real_ temperance which teaches a man to say ‘No,’ which teaches him to\r\nindulge in all that is conducive to happiness without being in danger\r\nof that overstepping of the boundary line which leads to misery. The\r\nman who has cultivated his body has also cultivated self-respect. He\r\nhas learned the virtue and the happiness of rigid personal cleanliness;\r\nhis views of life are sane and wholesome. Respecting himself he learns\r\nto respect others. He is gentle, and only uses his powers against his\r\nfellowmen when called upon to do so in the defence of the oppressed\r\nand helpless. It is your weakling who is generally a bully and a\r\ntyrant. To take a few men who are exceptionally endowed by Nature, to\r\nmake them extraordinarily strong, and to then train them to perform\r\nparticular feats, is not a thing very difficult of accomplishment.\r\nBut that is not the aim of physical culture. Its ultimate object is\r\nto raise the average standard of the race as a whole. That is, no\r\ndoubt, a stupendous task, and one which it may take many lifetimes to\r\naccomplish. But everything must have its beginning, and unless we set\r\nabout improving the physique of the present generation, we cannot hope\r\nto benefit those who come after us. Healthier and more perfect men and\r\nwomen will beget children with better constitutions and more free from\r\nhereditary taint. They in their turn, if the principles and the duty\r\nof physical culture are early instilled into them, will grow up more\r\nperfect types of men and women than were their mothers and fathers.\r\nSo the happy progression will go on, until, who knows, if in the days\r\nto come there will not be a race of mortals walking this earth of\r\nours even surpassing those who, according to the old myth, were the\r\noffspring of the union of the sons of the gods with the daughters of\r\nmen! That is, perhaps, an almost impossible ideal, but it is well to\r\nset one’s ideals high. Surely what has been done for the horse and the\r\ndog cannot be impossible of accomplishment in the case of man. At all\r\nevents, it is worth trying.”\r\n\r\nTo wind up this chapter with a word of encouragement to those who come\r\nquite fresh to the subject; to those who in taking up Physical Culture\r\nare venturing into what is to them unexplored territory--“Read, think,\r\nand work. Do not be disheartened because your progress at first seems\r\nslow; nothing worth having is to be won without labour. I can only\r\ntell you what to do, only point out to you the right road. The rest\r\nlies with yourself. I should be the sorriest humbug if I endeavoured\r\nto make you believe otherwise, and you would be the simplest of fools\r\nif you _did_ believe me. There is no royal road to success, and a very\r\nbad thing would it be if there were. For your reward lies not so much\r\nin the accomplishment as in the effort and struggle, and all the good\r\nqualities which they bring out.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already remarked upon the satisfactory progress which the\r\nsystem has made during the last few years. It is probably well-known\r\nthat my system has practically been adopted in the Army; although the\r\nmethod adopted in the Army gymnasia is not absolutely identical with\r\nthat which I advocate, it is obviously based upon the same principles.\r\nPeople may be interested to hear that since I opened my first school,\r\nsome eighteen months ago, amongst my pupils have been a great number\r\nof gentlemen, who, desirous of adopting the Army as a career, have\r\nbeen unable to do so through not coming up to the physical standpoint\r\nrequired. In many cases they have actually been rejected on this\r\naccount; in others they have been fearful that such might be their\r\nfate, and have come to me in order to avoid it. Some have not been\r\nheavy enough for their height; others lacking in chest measurement,\r\nand so on. Now let my system be judged by the results. _In not a\r\nsingle instance have I failed to do what is necessary._ That may stand\r\nby itself without any further comment from me. However, as a further\r\nproof of the efficacy of the system, I may say that I have put an\r\n_inch_ on the _height_ of a young fellow in _three weeks_! This may\r\nsound incredible, but it is an absolute fact. The majority of these\r\ngentlemen, whom I have helped to pass the Army “medical,” have written\r\nme appreciative letters, and though for obvious reasons I cannot\r\npublish them, I shall be happy to show them to any reader who may care\r\nto call at the St. James’-street school. That the value of the system\r\nis fully recognised in the Army is demonstrated by the letter from\r\nColonel Fox, late inspector of the Army Gymnasia, which appears in this\r\nbook. Amongst the civilian public the system is spreading rapidly;\r\nprivate individuals are taking it up and working steadily in their own\r\nhomes, whilst in a great number of gymnasia throughout the country,\r\nclasses are being formed to carry it out. In connection with this, it\r\nis highly diverting to notice that various individuals who are never\r\ntired of denouncing me and all my works, have set up as “professors”\r\nof physical culture, and are actually teaching my system! Of course\r\nthey would be loth to admit this, and would assert that it is a system\r\nof their own. All I can say is that by a strange coincidence nearly\r\nevery one of these systems which I have examined is based upon the same\r\nprinciples as my own. Now that I have made mention of those who try to\r\ngain notoriety by attacking my system, I cannot refrain from commenting\r\nupon certain statements which, having been widely circulated, may tend\r\nto do the system injury. The subject is, I think, worthy of a short\r\nchapter to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE STUPIDITY OF ENVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statement to which I refer is this--that though by my system a man\r\nmay increase the size of his muscles, add to his bodily strength, and\r\nimprove his physique, he does so at the expense of his vital organs.\r\nThis statement has been freely bandied about by those who ought to\r\nbe above such petty and stupid malice; men, who, professing to teach\r\nphysical culture, are mostly quite ignorant of the very rudiments of\r\nthe subject. Their reasons for such utterances are not far to seek;\r\nthey are envious of the success which has attended the years of hard\r\nwork and endeavour I have gone through, and regard me as a rival to\r\ndamage whom everything is justifiable. One or two have even gone so far\r\nas to say that I myself am anything but sound, that my heart is in a\r\nvery bad condition, and that there is every probability of my “going\r\nover to the majority” at a very early age.\r\n\r\nLet me nail these outrageous lies to the counter once and for all.\r\nSome who repeat them doubtless do so in good faith; let them listen\r\nand amend their ways. For those who circulated them, well knowing them\r\nto be false, I have no words in which to express my contempt. Fair and\r\nsquare opposition I can face; but a lie, however groundless, once sent\r\non its journey is difficult to overtake.\r\n\r\nNow for my refutation. First, amongst my pupils have been many who,\r\nprior to coming to me, had been rejected as unsound by Life Insurance\r\nCompanies; well, they have got their policies safely locked up now.\r\nSome had weak hearts, some poor lungs, others were generally unfit.\r\nThey came to me, generally, for two or three months, applied again,\r\nand were accepted. Those who doubt my word can, as in the case of the\r\nArmy lads, see the proofs for themselves. Is that good enough, or does\r\n“our friend, the enemy,” require any further demonstration that, far\r\nfrom injuring the vital organs, in many cases my system is enormously\r\nbeneficial to those who are delicate. If so, here it is. They say _I_\r\nam unsound; very well, here is an answer for them.\r\n\r\nSome months ago I was insured for a large sum in the Norwich Union\r\nLife Insurance Company; I was accepted in the _highest class_, and\r\nthe doctor who saw me expressed great surprise at the soundness of my\r\nheart, the strength of my lungs, and in fact at the fine condition of\r\nall my organs. Surely these envious people show little ingenuity in\r\ninventing falsehoods which can be so easily disproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW TO EXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commencing the system of exercises described and illustrated by\r\nthe anatomical chart, there are certain questions which every student\r\nnaturally asks himself.\r\n\r\nProbably the very first of these questions is, “What part of the day\r\nought I to devote to these exercises?”\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question must depend on the pupil himself--on his\r\nleisure and on his inclination. Some persons find the early morning the\r\nbest and most convenient time; others prefer the afternoon; and a third\r\nclass, again, find that they feel best, and have the most leisure, at\r\nnight. I do not, therefore, lay down a hard and fast rule of time. The\r\ngolden rule is to select such part of the day as suits you best, always\r\navoiding exercise immediately after meals. If possible, let two hours\r\nelapse between a meal and exercise. Moreover, do not exercise just\r\nbefore going to bed if you find it has a tendency to keep you awake.\r\nMany of my pupils find that they sleep much better after exercise; but\r\nthere are some upon whom it has a reverse effect.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the pupil should always exercise stripped to the waist;\r\nif he wear a singlet it should be cut well away round the arms, so as\r\nto allow of free play for the muscles around the shoulder. It is also\r\ndesirable to exercise before a looking-glass, for then the movements of\r\nthe various muscles can be followed, and to see the muscles at work,\r\nand to mark their steady development, is itself a help and a pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn performing the exercises the pupil should bend the knees slightly\r\nand keep the muscles of the thighs tense; the legs will thus share in\r\nthe benefit of all the movements.\r\n\r\nWhat I wish to impress on delicate pupils is the desirability of\r\nprogress by degrees. Many men before beginning my system of physical\r\ntraining have been so weak that doctors have thought little of the\r\nprospect of saving their lives, yet to-day they are amongst the\r\nstrongest. They have progressed gradually, always being careful not\r\nto undertake too much, and thus to adapt the exercises to their own\r\nindividual requirements. It may be mentioned also that the old, as\r\nwell as the young, may derive great benefits from my system, though\r\nall who are over the age of fifty should moderate the exercises on the\r\nlines suggested in the table of ages for pupils between fifteen and\r\nseventeen. My exercises will also be found of considerable benefit to\r\npersons who suffer from obesity.\r\n\r\nPupils must not be discouraged because, after the first few days’\r\ntraining, they may feel stiff. It sometimes happens that a young man or\r\nwoman, or perhaps a middle-aged one, sets out on the course of training\r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm. After the first two or three days the\r\nenthusiasm, perhaps, wears off. Then comes a period of stiffness, and\r\nthe pupil is inclined to think that he cannot be bothered to proceed\r\nwith the course. To such pupils, I would say, in all earnestness,\r\n“Don’t be overcome by apparent difficulties; if you wish to succeed,\r\ngo forward; never draw back.” This stiffness, moreover, becomes a very\r\npleasant feeling. You soon grow to like it; personally, indeed, it may\r\nbe said that it is one of the most agreeable sensations I have ever had.\r\n\r\nFrequently pupils ask me how long it should take them to get strong.\r\nThe answer again depends on themselves, not only on their physical\r\nconstitution, but also on the amount of will power they put into their\r\nexercises. As I have said already, it is the brain that developers the\r\nmuscles. Brain will do as much as dumb-bells, even more. For example,\r\nwhen you are sitting down reading, practise contracting your muscles.\r\nDo this every time you are sitting down leisurely, and by contracting\r\nthem harder and harder each time, you will find that it will have\r\nthe same effect as the use of dumb-bells or any more vigorous form of\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nIt is very advisable for all pupils to get into the habit of constantly\r\npractising this muscle-contraction. In itself it is an admirable\r\nexercise, but it is perhaps even more valuable owing to the fact that\r\nit improves the will power and helps to establish that connection\r\nbetween the brain and the muscles which is the basis of strength and\r\n“condition.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that throughout my exercises I make a point of\r\nalternate movements. By this means one arm, or, as the case may be,\r\none set of muscles, is given a momentary rest whilst the other is\r\nin motion, and thus freer circulation is gained than by performing\r\nthe movements simultaneously and the strain upon the heart and lungs\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nAnother question which pupils are constantly asking me is whether it\r\nis right for them to perspire after the exercises. The answer to this\r\nquestion is that it depends on the constitution of the pupil. If you\r\nperspire, it does you good; if you do not it shows that your condition\r\nis sound already. Of course it will be understood that I am answering\r\nin this, as in other questions, for general cases. There are always\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nAgain, “What,” it is asked, “are the general benefits of the Sandow\r\nsystem of physical training?”\r\n\r\nThe benefits are not, of course, confined to the visible muscular\r\ndevelopment. The inner organs of the body also share them. The\r\nliver and kidneys are kept in good order, the heart and nerves are\r\nstrengthened, the brain and energy are braced up. The body, in fact,\r\nlike a child, wants to be educated, and only through a series of\r\nexercises can this education be given. By its aid the whole body is\r\ndeveloped and, as will be seen, pupils who have conscientiously worked\r\nat my system testify freely to the good results obtained, not only in\r\nthe direction of vastly increasing their muscular strength, but of\r\nraising the standard of their vitality and general health.\r\n\r\nFor the beginner the most difficult part of my system is so fully to\r\nconcentrate his mind on his muscles as to get them absolutely under\r\ncontrol. It will be found, however, that this control comes by degrees.\r\nThe brain sends a message to the muscles; the nerves receive it, and\r\npass it on to them. With regard to the will power that is exerted it\r\nshould be remembered that whilst the effect of weight lifting is to\r\ncontract the muscles, the same effect is produced by merely contracting\r\nthe muscles without lifting the weight.\r\n\r\nThis question of “will power” has, I am aware, troubled a good many\r\nof my pupils. The majority find it difficult to “put all they know”\r\ninto movements with small dumb-bells, and consequently are apt to be\r\ndisappointed at the results of their work. Not infrequently I have\r\nreceived a letter stating that the writer is doing the exercises an\r\nimmense number of times, occupying several hours a day--three or\r\nfour or even more!--and yet does not find that there is very much\r\nimprovement. The reason is obvious; he is simply “going through” the\r\nmotions and not really working at them. On the other hand, here and\r\nthere, I come across a man possessing an amount of will power out of\r\nall proportion to his strength. The consequence is that he soon gets\r\nexhausted, and either cannot get through his exercises or only does so\r\nat the cost of becoming thoroughly done up and jaded. The great rule\r\nthat progress in the direction of the exertion of will power should be\r\ngradual and ever continuing, is one that many people confess they are\r\nunable to carry out.\r\n\r\nNow I have for long been perplexed to find a means of remedying this,\r\nand at last I think I have discovered a method whereby the amount of\r\nwill-power exerted by the pupil can be regulated. In the next chapter\r\nparticulars are given of my new “Grip” Dumb-bell, which I think ought\r\nto prove a veritable godsend to all, and especially to those to whom\r\nreference has just been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMY “GRIP” DUMB-BELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appliance is very simple and may be described in a few words. It\r\nconsists of a dumb-bell made in two halves separated about an inch\r\nand a half from one another, the intervening space being occupied by\r\na small steel spring. When exercising, the spring is compressed by\r\ngripping the bells and bringing the two halves close together, in which\r\nposition they are kept until the exercise is over. The springs can be\r\nof any strength, and consequently the power necessary to keep the two\r\nhalves together can be varied to any extent.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this arrangement are obvious. Whether he will or\r\nno, the pupil _must grip_ the bells hard, and as the strength of the\r\nsprings are known he can regulate his progress to a nicety as he grows\r\nstronger. There is also another point in connection with the new\r\ndevice to which I want to draw particular attention. It will often\r\nhappen that a pupil who is exercising will feel “a bit off-colour” one\r\nday, and consequently less inclined to exercise, or he may be worried\r\nand perplexed by his business affairs to a degree which lenders it\r\nalmost impossible for him to concentrate his mind solely upon the\r\nwork. The natural consequence of either of these two conditions is\r\nthat unless he possess very uncommon will power, if he is exercising\r\nwith ordinary bells, he only does so in a desultory and half-hearted\r\nmanner, and benefits little thereby. Now this is impossible with the\r\n“grip” bell--however preoccupied and worried the pupil may be he\r\nhas a definite point upon which to concentrate his mind; he _must_\r\nexert a certain amount of force in gripping the bells to keep the two\r\nhalves together, and consequently _must_ put out a certain amount of\r\nwill-power.\r\n\r\nOf course there is no reason why in using the “grip” dumb-bells, only\r\nthe grip necessary to keep the two halves together should be exerted.\r\nOn the contrary, as with ordinary bells, a man may, and should put “all\r\nhe knows” into the work; the special point and the great merit about\r\nthe former is that with them the amount of power exerted can never fall\r\nbelow a known and easily regulated _minimum_.\r\n\r\nThe pupil who possesses these bells will find that instead of having\r\nto be continually buying heavier dumb-bells, one pair will suffice him\r\nfor all time. All that it will be necessary for him to do will be to\r\npurchase, at a small expense, new springs from time to time. All pupils\r\nare advised to use the dumb-bell, upon the merits of which I need not\r\nfurther enlarge. As will have been seen, this is not a mechanical\r\ndevice which will render unnecessary the employment of will-power; that\r\nwould be opposed to all my theories and teaching. On the contrary it\r\nwill aid in developing will-power, as it will stimulate the pupil to\r\nput it forth, and guide him how to use it in the proper direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC COLD BATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sometimes accused of being a bit of a faddist about the use of the\r\ncold bath, and possibly the heading of this chapter may give strength\r\nto that opinion. But its exhilarating and health-giving effects really\r\njustify the use of the adjective. The longer I live, and the greater my\r\nexperience, the more am I convinced of its virtues. Let me advise every\r\npupil after exercising, while the body is still hot, to take a cold\r\nbath. It does not matter how much he may be perspiring; the cold bath\r\nwill prove exceedingly beneficial. He must be careful, however, not to\r\ntake his bath if he is out of breath. The exercises will, no doubt,\r\nquicken the heart’s action; but in from three to five minutes after the\r\nseries is completed, the heart should be beating normally again. For\r\npersons who suffer from weak heart I should not advise a cold bath.\r\nAs a general rule there is no need to ask the question, “Is my heart\r\nweak?” For if it is weak you should know it beyond a doubt. After every\r\nlittle exertion, though the assertion may appear paradoxical, you will\r\nfeel it beating in your head.\r\n\r\nIn advising cold baths, I speak, of course, for persons in the\r\nenjoyment of ordinary health. The bath should be begun in the summer\r\nand continued every morning throughout the year. In the winter, if the\r\nroom is cold, light the gas and close the window. If your hair is not\r\ninjuriously affected by cold water--and in many cases, I believe, cold\r\nwater will be found to strengthen it--begin, as you stand over the\r\nbath, by splashing the water five and twenty times over your head. In\r\nany case, if you are averse to wetting the hair, be careful to begin by\r\nsponging the temples and nape of the neck. Next, whilst still standing\r\nover the bath, splash the water fifteen times against the chest and\r\nten times against the heart. Then jump into the bath, going right down\r\nunder the water. In the summer you may remain in the water from ten to\r\nfifteen seconds, but in the winter let it be just a jump in and out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent rub down with towels is popularly supposed to produce\r\nhalf the benefits that result from a cold bath. I have no hesitation\r\nin saying that this is a great mistake. Let me explain the reason: As\r\nyou get out of the bath you rub down first one part of the body and\r\nthen the other, and thus, whilst the one part is being warmed by the\r\nfriction, the other is getting cold. Many people who take cold baths\r\nin this way complain of touches of rheumatism, and the whole trouble\r\narises, I believe, from different parts of the body being alternately\r\nwarmed and chilled.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the risk of this ill-effect my advice is this:\r\nDo not spend any time over rubbing yourself down. If you do not like\r\nthe idea of getting into your clothes wet, just take the water off the\r\nbody as quickly as you possibly can with a dry towel, jump into your\r\nclothes, and let Nature restore your circulation in her own way. You\r\nwill get quite as warm by this method as by vigorously rubbing down,\r\nwith the added advantage that the heat of the body will be more evenly\r\ndistributed. If, owing to poor health or other exceptional causes, the\r\ncirculation is not fully and promptly restored, walk briskly up and\r\ndown the room. If you should still feel cold in any part of the body\r\nprobably the bath is not suited to your constitution, and in that case\r\nit is not advised. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, however, the\r\ncold bath, taken as I have described, will have nothing but the most\r\nbeneficial effects; and, if taken every morning throughout the year,\r\nit is the surest preventive that I know against catching cold. On the\r\nother hand, irregularity is liable to produce cold. In short, having\r\nonce begun the cold bath, make a rule, summer and winter, never to\r\nleave it off.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find the very best form of the cold bath is to get\r\ninto your clothes after it without drying the body at all. For the\r\nfirst moment or two the sensation may not be perfectly agreeable, but\r\nafterwards you feel better and warmer for adopting this method. The\r\ndamp is carried away through the clothes and no particle of wet is left.\r\n\r\nFor pupils who have not the convenience of a bathroom a cold sponging\r\ndown may be recommended as a substitute. In this case let two towels\r\nbe taken and soaked with water. Rub the front of the body down with\r\none, and the back with the other. This method prevents the towel\r\nfrom absorbing the heat from the body, and the cold sponging is thus\r\ndistributed evenly over its surface. Afterwards dry the body quickly as\r\nbefore, letting no time be lost in getting into your clothes.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked whether in the event of exercising at night it\r\nis advisable to take a cold bath afterwards. My reply is:—“certainly.”\r\n_Always_ have a cold bath or sponge down after exercising. It will\r\nmake you feel “as fresh as paint,” improve your appetite, and make\r\nthe skin clean and firm, and be generally conducive to happiness and\r\ngood health. Some people tell me that a cold bath immediately before\r\nretiring keeps them awake; if that be so, I should advise them to\r\nexercise earlier in the day. But the exercise and the cold bath ought\r\nto be regarded as inseparable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CULTURE FOR THE MIDDLE-AGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary for me to say that the benefits to be obtained\r\nby conscientiously working upon my system are by no means confined to\r\nthe young and vigorous. On the contrary, it is particularly suitable\r\nfor the middle-aged, who are all too apt to suffer from the effects of\r\nthe period of physical indolence which has succeeded their youthful\r\nactivity. To such, the system should prove invaluable. It is quite\r\na false notion to suppose that when once youth is passed exercise\r\nis no longer necessary. _So long as life lasts, if an individual\r\nwants to keep healthy, exercise is just as necessary as food._ It is\r\nthrough neglecting to recognise this that so many men become aged\r\nbefore their time. When a man begins to get into middle life he has\r\na natural tendency to “take things easy.” He lives more luxuriously,\r\ndevotes more time to the pleasures, of the table, and exerts himself\r\nas little as possible. Is it anything to wonder at that his health\r\nsuffers, that he grows fat and flabby, and that his digestive apparatus\r\nquickly gets out of gear? If in his youth he has been an athlete the\r\nmore will his changed mode of life tell upon him; it is indeed better\r\nnever to have exercised at all than to exercise for a few years and\r\nthen drop it entirely. It is for this reason we hear of the health\r\nof so many athletes failing them at a comparatively early age. And\r\nthis failure is, as a rule, erroneously ascribed to the effects upon\r\ntheir constitution of their early efforts. Once and again errors in\r\n“training” may be responsible for poor health in middle-age, but in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred the complete cessation from active\r\nbodily work, combined with the greater indulgence which naturally\r\nfollows, is alone responsible.\r\n\r\nOf course, while it is advisable that the middle-aged man should\r\nexercise regularly, I must warn him not to do too much. He must\r\nremember that what is perfectly safe and prudent at five-and-twenty may\r\nbe rash and hazardous at fifty; in short, that he, while exercising\r\nconsistently and steadily, must be careful not to over-tax his powers.\r\nIf he bears this in mind he will find that the discomforts and ailments\r\nwhich he has perhaps got to regard as natural to his time of life are\r\nquickly banished, and that, in spite of his grey beard and thinning\r\nhair, it is still “good to be alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CULTURE FOR WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly anxious to remove the impression, which has, I fear,\r\ngained ground, that my system is not a thing for women. Now-a-days,\r\nwhen women have practically freed themselves from the antiquated\r\nideas of a generation or so ago, there ought to be small difficulty\r\nin convincing them that to make the best of themselves, in a physical\r\nsense, is just as imperative a duty for them as for their brothers.\r\nWomen go in for all sorts of sports and pastimes to-day; they bicycle,\r\nrow, play tennis and hockey, and not infrequently display no small\r\ndegree of excellence in sports which have hitherto been regarded as\r\n“for men only.” This is a hopeful sign, but I am not at all sure that\r\nin many cases it is not more provocative of harm than good. Women\r\nare possessed of a great amount of nervous energy, and, unless their\r\nbodies and organs are gradually and systematically trained to bear\r\nexertion and fatigue, they are likely to attempt performances which\r\nare quite beyond their physical power, although, buoyed up as they are\r\nby a fund of nervous energy and mental exhilaration, they may observe\r\nno ill-effects at the time. This is one reason why it is so advisable\r\nfor women to commence by working upon my system, which is so mild and\r\ngradual that they can pursue it without any risks, and, while daily\r\ngrowing stronger and healthier, be scarcely conscious that they are\r\nmaking any effort whatever.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that there is a very wide-spread notion that\r\nexercise tends to coarsen and render a woman unbeautiful, but that is\r\nabsolutely false. Were there any truth in it I should indeed despair\r\nof converting my fair readers to my way of thinking, for truly it is\r\nwoman’s mission to look beautiful. But the idea is absurd; Nature,\r\nwhich intended woman to look lovely, also intended her to be healthy;\r\nindeed, the two are practically synonymous. Of course, improper,\r\nviolent and one-sided exercise will naturally result in making a\r\nwoman clumsy, heavy, and ungraceful, but proper exercise, having for\r\nits object symmetrical and perfect development, will have an exactly\r\ncontrary effect. Curiously enough, the visible effect of proper\r\nexercise upon a woman’s muscles is not precisely the same as upon those\r\nof a man. Regular and gradually progressive exercise will not make a\r\nwoman’s muscles prominent, but will cause them to grow firm and round\r\nand impart to the outline of the figure those graceful contours which\r\nare so universally admired. Without well-conditioned muscle the most\r\nbeautifully proportioned woman in the world will look comparatively\r\nshapeless and flabby; her muscles are not required to show up as in\r\nthe case of a man’s, but they must be there all the same as a solid\r\nfoundation for the overlying flesh. Take a woman’s arm, for instance;\r\nif it has been duly exercised and developed, it is easy enough to see\r\nthat its shapeliness and good modelling are due to the muscles; white\r\nand soft though the skin may be, you can tell at a glance that it is\r\nfirm and elastic to the touch. On the other hand, the arm of the woman\r\nwho has never exercised the muscles, betrays the fact unmistakably;\r\nit may be plump and round, but its lines are lacking in beauty, its\r\nmovements in grace; and so with the figure generally.\r\n\r\n       ———————————————\r\n\r\nThe effects of my system are very rapidly noticeable. It reduces the\r\nsize of the waist, makes the limbs round, the figure pliant, the walk\r\nand carriage graceful and easy. For those women who are doomed to a\r\nmore or less sedentary life it works wonders, and those whose means and\r\noccupation permit of their indulging in a healthier outdoor life will\r\nfind it a splendid preparation for their favourite pastimes.\r\n\r\nJust a word with regard to complexion. A fine skin and a good healthy\r\ncolour are the best proofs of the possession of good health. Indeed,\r\nwithout health a good skin and complexion are out of the question; and\r\nwhere is the woman who does not desire to possess both? She is indeed\r\nrare. Therefore, to those women who, while they do not set a high\r\nenough value upon health and strength for their own sakes, yet desire\r\nto be fair to look upon, I say the two things must inevitably go hand\r\nin hand. Whether your prime object be to obtain beauty or health does\r\nnot matter; by working upon my system you will obtain both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TABLES OF AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the following tables pupils of all ages will be able to see at a\r\nglance how many times the movements of each exercise illustrated by the\r\nanatomical chart should be practised daily.\r\n\r\nIt should be clearly understood that the tables are only intended as\r\na guide, and that they are not intended to arbitrarily fix the amount\r\nof work which the pupil should do. It is an absolute impossibility to\r\nlay down rules which will suit every individual case, and consequently\r\npupils must, after taking the table as a basis, use their own\r\ndiscretion as to how they shall vary them. The great thing to bear\r\nin mind is to proceed very gradually; while exercising, put “all you\r\nknow” into the work, but don’t attempt to do too much. Exercise until\r\nthe muscles ache, but never go on to the point of feeling thoroughly\r\n“blown” and exhausted. A quarter of an hour’s conscientious work is\r\nbetter than an hour spent in “going through the motions” in a desultory\r\nfashion. Pupils who are in any difficulty and wish for special guidance\r\nare advised to go in for the 2s. 6d. course of instruction by post\r\nwhich is given in connection with “Physical Culture,” full particulars\r\nof which are given in this book. As I have already said, I should\r\nadvise all pupils to use the “Grip” dumb-bell; then, instead of buying\r\na heavier pair of dumb-bells after the exercises are being done a\r\ncertain number of times, all that will be necessary will be to use\r\na stronger spring. I do not advise pupils to keep on with the same\r\nweight bells or the same spring too long; when the exercises are done\r\na very great number of times the work becomes monotonous and there is\r\na natural tendency to do it in a mechanical manner. Roughly speaking,\r\nwhen it takes much over half-an-hour to get through the whole series it\r\nis desirable to begin again with heavier bells or springs.\r\n\r\nParents who desire to see their little ones grow into well-developed\r\nmen and women may be advised to buy their babies light wooden\r\ndumb-bells as playthings. The exercises themselves, of course, should\r\nnot be attempted until the child has reached the age of six or seven.\r\nParents especially would do well to remember, as has already been said,\r\nthat the tables are only intended as a guide, and they should exercise\r\ntheir own discretion with regard to the weight of bells used by their\r\nchildren, and the number of times the exercises should be done. In some\r\ncases a girl or boy of ten years may be so delicate as to have no more\r\nstrength than a more sturdy child two or three years younger; in such\r\ncases the table for the younger child should be adhered to. From that\r\nage onwards be guided in the amount of practice by the tables. In order\r\nthat every reader may understand the exercises easily, the leading\r\nmuscles only are mentioned in the chart.\r\n\r\nPupils should guard against over-exertion; and, above all things,\r\nshould not exercise violently. It will be found convenient to let each\r\narm (not both arms) move once in a second. Thus, for example, the time\r\nof ten movements with each arm of the first exercise would be twenty\r\nseconds. As a general rule, this time will be found to give just the\r\nexercise that is needed. Faster movements are not recommended for\r\neither young or old. Be careful also not to jerk the movements. Always\r\nexercise easily and gracefully, and when contracting the muscles take\r\ncare _not to hold the breath_. Many pupils are inclined to do this\r\nunconsciously when bringing their minds to bear upon the muscles, but\r\nit is quite wrong, and the tendency must be striven against until it is\r\novercome. In one or two exercises, as will be seen on the chart, there\r\nare special instructions with regard to the breath; in all the others\r\nthe breathing should be perfectly natural.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE 1.\r\n\r\n                      FOR CHILDREN OF BOTH SEXES\r\n                  BETWEEN THE AGES OF SEVEN AND TEN.\r\n\r\n                 (_Using one pound dumb-bells only._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the _maximum_ has been reached, the child should _continue_ to use\r\nthe same weight bells and the same spring in the “Grip” dumb-bell until\r\nit arrives at the age at which it can follow Table No. 2, and so on\r\nwith the other tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Increase\r\n     No. of            No. of                     of Movements.\r\n    Exercise.

The heaviest bells used, however, should not\r\nexceed 10lbs.\r\n\r\nI am aware that in the former edition of the book I placed 20lbs. as\r\nthe limit, but the experience gained in my schools has taught me that\r\nfor the _majority_ of men this is far too heavy. It is always better\r\nto use bells too light than too heavy; the latter are liable to cause\r\nstrains and other injuries.\r\n\r\n   No. of            No. of             Increase\r\n  Exercise.

It came through no seeking of my own, after\r\nmy defeat of Samson. I accepted it partly because the offers seemed\r\ntoo good to be thrown away, and partly because they enabled me to\r\ngratify a wish to see something of the world. My ambition, however, was\r\nalways to form and build up a system for the service of others, rather\r\nthan exhibit merely the results of that system in my own person. That\r\nambition, I hope, is to be realised, for I have founded several schools\r\nof training for men, women, and children of both sexes, and in the\r\ncourse of time, I intend to establish branches in every important town.\r\n\r\nThe schools are conducted entirely on my own system of physical\r\nculture. Instruction is given by specially qualified teachers, and\r\nevery exercise is lucidly described and clearly demonstrated. The\r\npupils have every opportunity of developing their bodies to the highest\r\nextent, and from time to time I personally examine them.\r\n\r\nThe instructors employed in the school have been specially trained\r\nfor their work by me, so that the pupils have the benefit of my best\r\ninformation, and of thus learning the whole of my system exactly. In\r\naddition to the classes for men, women, and children, arrangements are\r\nmade for giving private lessons when required.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Mr. Warwick Brookes, jun., is the best pupil I have\r\never had. For the past six years he has followed my system thoroughly,\r\nand the results have been remarkable. When I first met him he was\r\nexceedingly delicate. He could only walk with the aid of crutches.\r\nGradually, however, he began to improve, and under my personal\r\nsupervision, by the help of my system, his strength has so increased\r\nthat to-day he is like a new man.\r\n\r\nBy means of the schools I hope to do something to substantially aid the\r\nphysical development of this and succeeding generations. Letters from\r\npast pupils testify to the great benefits which can be derived from\r\ncareful training under my system, and if the training has the further\r\nadvantage of individual instruction those benefits should be increased\r\neven more than by studying this book.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant ambition to hope by one’s efforts to leave the world\r\njust a little better here and there than one found it; and that has\r\nalways been and is my ambition. My pupils can help me to realise it.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I intend opening schools in every large town in the\r\ncountry; at present schools are open at the following addresses:—\r\n\r\n         {32, St. James’s Street, S.W.\r\n         {115A, Ebury Street, S.W.\r\n  LONDON {Walbrook, City, E.C.\r\n         {Tottenham Court Road, W.\r\n         {Crystal Palace, S.E.\r\n\r\n  MANCHESTER:—Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION BY CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of my departments has shown a more gratifying development than has\r\nthe correspondence department. Letters pour in from all parts of the\r\nworld asking for advice and instruction in such numbers that I have\r\nbeen obliged to organise a special system and department for dealing\r\nwith the enquiries of my many friends, who, owing to their living at a\r\ndistance and to other reasons, cannot attend the schools personally.\r\n\r\nEvery week many letters reach me from the Colonies alone--from India,\r\nCanada, Australia, South Africa--even from distant Klondike--and\r\nfrom one and all I have received flattering testimonials as to the\r\nbenefits they have derived from following my instructions. This is an\r\nexample:--Mr. Dunbar, of Queensland, writes:—\r\n\r\n “Dear Mr. Sandow,\r\n\r\n “I cannot express my gratitude for the wonderful benefit I have\r\n derived from your three months’ course of instruction. Previous to\r\n practising your system I was a chronic dyspeptic, and owing to my\r\n sedentary occupation, for many years I had not known what it was\r\n to feel the natural exhilaration and energy of a healthy man. Now\r\n I honestly believe that there is not a healthier man in the whole\r\n Colony.”\r\n\r\nOne pleasing feature of this undertaking is the steady increase in the\r\nnumber of applications from ladies. This department has already become\r\nthe most important part of my work, and anyone wishing to keep in touch\r\nwith my system of Physical Culture can do so by forwarding to me their\r\nmeasurements, sex, age, and occupation. In the case of any physical\r\npeculiarity, or organic weakness, a doctor should be consulted, and\r\nthe result of his examination stated in the letter of communication. A\r\nform is inserted at the end of this book as a guide to those wishing to\r\napply. These forms are dealt with by myself and each case receives my\r\nindividual consideration and instruction, and is signed by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSANDOW’S CHART OF MEASUREMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure will show pupils how to take their own measurements. They\r\nare advised to keep a careful record of these month by month, so\r\nthey can see how they are progressing. The chest should be measured\r\nboth with the lungs full of air and empty, as well as in its normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n                    _Date when training commenced._\r\n\r\n  .....................................................\r\n\r\n                    _Date on completion of course._\r\n\r\n  .....................................................\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Measurements then._      _Measurements now._\r\n\r\n  _Age_\r\n  _Weight_\r\n  _Height_\r\n  _Neck_\r\n  _Chest Contracted_\r\n  _Chest Expanded_\r\n  _Upper Right Arm_\r\n  _Upper Left Arm_\r\n  _Forearm, Right_\r\n  _Forearm, Left_\r\n  _Waist_\r\n  _Thigh, Right_\r\n  _Thigh, Left_\r\n  _Calf, Right_\r\n  _Calf, Left_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing the positions of measurement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMBINED DEVELOPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter considerable experience and exhaustive experiments with rubber\r\nmachines, I have succeeded in inventing one which allows of a\r\ncombination of dumb-bell and rubber exercises.\r\n\r\nExclusive rubber exercise has not the effect of producing hard, firm,\r\nand supple muscles, therefore I have patented the detachable dumb-bell\r\nhandles, which are simplicity itself.\r\n\r\nThis developer can be so regulated as to prove equally beneficial to a\r\nweak man as to myself.\r\n\r\nFrom an economic point of view it stands alone, as at a small outlay a\r\nDeveloper can be purchased, which is sufficient for a whole family, and\r\nconstitutes an entire athletic outfit.\r\n\r\nThe detachable rubbers and handles allow of the machine to be fixed up\r\nto any tension, so that as one becomes stronger, one has ample scope\r\nfor gradually increasing one’s strength. The fatal drawback to the\r\nordinary rubber exerciser is that it only proves beneficial up to a\r\ncertain point, and then it is not sufficient to carry one any further.\r\nConsequently one has to make another outlay in purchasing a heavier\r\nmachine. My Developer has been designed to obviate this, as it can be\r\nregulated up to any strength.\r\n\r\nThe machine is simply made and easily fixed, causing no damage to the\r\ndoor or wall to which it is attached. There being no pulleys, no oiling\r\nis required, and there is no friction to wear out the covering of the\r\ncords. Thus the Developer is very durable.\r\n\r\nCharts, illustrating Chest Expander, Dumb-bell and Developer exercises,\r\ntogether with a pair of nickel-plated dumb-bells, are given free with\r\neach machine. The dumb-bells being detachable can be used separately\r\nfor the exercises as prescribed in this book. The exercises are\r\nspecially arranged by myself, introducing several of the movements in\r\nmy system of development which cannot be properly executed on any other\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIn the charts are included special exercises for strengthening the\r\nlegs; many pupils have found this very beneficial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The above illustration shows the Developer as a Rubber\r\nExerciser, Chest Expander, and Dumb-bells.]\r\n\r\nThe great value of the Developer lies in the fact that it serves to\r\nrender the muscles pliable, and the whole body flexible and supple.\r\nCertain movements with it, too, are difficult to perform satisfactorily\r\nwith dumb-bells alone. I recommend pupils to use the dumb-bells\r\nand complete Developer alternately; by this means I find the most\r\nsatisfactory results are obtained. Exercise with the rubber Developer\r\naffords a welcome change from work with the dumb-bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHEAVY WEIGHT-LIFTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose in this book to give anything beyond general\r\ndirections for lifting heavy weights. You can become thoroughly strong\r\nand enjoy perfect health by means of the series of exercises already\r\ndescribed. Heavy weight-lifting requires personal instruction; that\r\ninstruction will be given to those who may desire it at my schools.\r\nUnder qualified instructors it may be pursued without the risk of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, it may be observed that to lift heavy weights it is\r\ndesirable first to see what weight can be used without undue strain.\r\nSlowly raise this weight from your shoulder over your head, or, if from\r\nthe ground, raise it somewhat more quickly. See how many times you are\r\nable to raise the weight first selected, and when you can perform the\r\nexercise with comparative ease, raising it, say, ten times, up to 80\r\nlbs., six times from 80 to 100, and afterwards three times, increase\r\nthe weight for the next day’s exercise by five pounds. Continue this\r\nincrease as you grow more capable, remembering always to bring the left\r\nhand into play as well as the right; at the same time, though it should\r\nnot be neglected, avoid overtaxing the left side.\r\n\r\nThe great thing to remember is to go slowly. Avoid anything like\r\nspasmodic efforts, and endeavour before trying a lift to thoroughly\r\nthink out the different movements. Weight-lifting should never be\r\npractised in a confined space or where the weight cannot be readily\r\ndropped. To attempt to hold on to a weight after the balance has been\r\nlost may result in serious strains and other injuries; the pupil should\r\npractice dropping a weight from any position safely and gracefully.\r\nIf the pupil bear these few hints in mind he will come to no harm,\r\nbut, as I have said, weight-lifting is best left alone until it can be\r\npractised under the personal supervision of an experienced instructor.\r\n\r\n       ———————————————\r\n\r\n                          A PLEASING TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written me by Colonel Fox, late Her Majesty’s\r\nInspector of Army Gymnasia, a gentleman to whom I am very greatly\r\nindebted for the interest he has taken for years past in my work and\r\nfor the zeal he has shown in getting the system introduced into the\r\nBritish Army:—\r\n\r\n                                        The Gymnasium. Aldershot.\r\n                                             29th July, 1893.\r\n\r\n Dear Mr. Sandow,\r\n\r\n I am in receipt of your letter from New York which reached me on the\r\n 23rd instant, and am very glad to hear of your success in America.\r\n The book you speak of as being about to be published should also be\r\n very successful, and ought to do much towards making your system of\r\n physical development widely known.[1] Since your last visit to us here\r\n my Staff Instructors and non-commissioned officers under training have\r\n been energetically practicing the light dumb-bell exercises you so\r\n kindly showed them.\r\n\r\n I am convinced that your series of exercises are excellent and most\r\n carefully thought out, with a comprehensive view to the development of\r\n the body as a _whole_. Any man honestly following out your clear and\r\n simple instructions could not fail to enormously and rapidly improve\r\n his physique.\r\n\r\n It is almost superfluous for me to add that you yourself, in _propria\r\n persona_, are the best possible advertisement of the merits of your\r\n system of training and developing of the human body.\r\n\r\n Any individual gifted with a fair amount of determination,\r\n is absolutely certain to develop his physical powers at an\r\n extraordinarily rapid rate and with the most happy results to his\r\n general health and mental powers and activity, by following with\r\n intelligence your system. As you very rightly say, it is only by\r\n bringing the brain to bear upon our exercises that we can hope to\r\n produce the best results with the shortest possible expenditure of\r\n time.\r\n\r\n The absence of expensive and cumbrous apparatus is no small\r\n recommendation of your system, and you are thoroughly in the right\r\n when you assert that lasting muscular development, and consequent\r\n strength, can be best produced by the constant and energetic use of\r\n light dumb-bells, employed in a sound and scientific manner.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, yours very truly,\r\n  (Signed) G. M. Fox, Lieut.-Colonel,\r\n  H.M. Inspector of Gymnasia in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n Professor Eugen Sandow, New York, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n[1] The book referred to is the large one which was published some\r\nyears ago, and which is now out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF PUPILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages will be found a selection from many thousands\r\nof letters which have been addressed to me by pupils who have already\r\nprofited from my system of Physical Culture. Attention is specially\r\ndirected to the measurements before and after training, showing the\r\nactual progress made in muscular development.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VACHWEN,\r\n  MARLBOROUGH ROAD,\r\n  WATFORD,\r\n  _March 11th, 1899_.\r\n\r\n  MR. SANDOW.\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n _I have just completed a course of lessons at your “School of Physical\r\n Culture,” from which I have derived untold benefit. Through the\r\n greater part of last year I was so ill that for some time it was\r\n feared I might go into consumption. I was medically treated, and at\r\n length permitted by my doctor to try what your exercises would do._\r\n\r\n _I entered your School with weak heart, weak lungs, digestion sadly\r\n impaired. After three lessons, with persistent home work, I began very\r\n slowly to gain strength and an appetite, and now, at the end of my\r\n course, I am quite a new creature--full of vitality and energy._\r\n\r\n _The upper part of the lung, which was the chief cause of my trouble,\r\n is quite healed and healthy. I never know now what it is to feel pain\r\n and tightness in the bronchial tubes, from which I constantly suffered\r\n in the past. My digestive organs too are quite well._\r\n\r\n I have gained in weight                          7 lbs.\r\n   ”       ”   round the neck 1 in.\r\n   ”       ”   in the chest (contracted)          3½ ins.\r\n   ”       ”     ”      ”   (expanded)            4  ins.\r\n   ”       ”     ”    forearm                     2½ ins.\r\n   ”       ”     ”    upper arm                   2½ ins.\r\n   ”       ”    in lung capacity                 100 cbc. ins.\r\n\r\n _I should be quite pleased to be of use to you at any time in\r\n recommending to weak ones, who may be timid to commence the work, the\r\n immense benefit to be derived from it, by my own personal experience.\r\n I should like also to mention the very kind and careful treatment\r\n I have received both from your Manager, Mr. Clease, and the Class\r\n Instructor.

The result is far beyond my\r\n expectations. I am nineteen years of age and small of stature, being\r\n only five feet in height and seven stone in weight, yet, without\r\n exaggeration, I can say that my strength and muscular development\r\n would do credit to a man six feet high._\r\n\r\n _I have gained this solely by your system and cannot praise it too\r\n highly._\r\n\r\n _Another great advantage over other systems is the small outlay\r\n required, as I have obtained for a few shillings all that is necessary\r\n to train with, whereas if I had trained under another system I should\r\n have had to have made a much larger outlay for apparatus._\r\n\r\n _I enclose a list stating what I have gained in strength and muscle\r\n since I started training._\r\n\r\n _It will always be a great pleasure to me to answer any questions\r\n concerning your system, likewise interview anyone who might be\r\n desirous of seeing me._\r\n\r\n  _I remain,\r\n  Yours truly_,\r\n  THOS.

In what\r\n measure I have succeeded can best be seen by comparison of my original\r\n efforts and my present attainments, of which I also forward a list.\r\n Although they are as yet nothing to boast about or sufficiently\r\n great to be handed down to posterity, they are the result of close\r\n application to the system Mr. Sandow originated, and by means of\r\n which, in a few years, I hope to attain the culmination of human\r\n strength, and, if possible, to rival that of Sandow himself, for I am\r\n a firm believer in starting with an almost unattainable ideal, then\r\n gradually coming within measurable distance of it, and eventually,\r\n perhaps, to reach it. To do this will require the exercise of many\r\n mental qualities, determination, perseverance, and endurance. I\r\n suppose there are many young men like myself in whom Mr. Sandow has\r\n awakened a latent ambition to muscular prowess, and in doing so I\r\n state without any hesitation that he alone has done as much good for\r\n the country as any man of the present century._\r\n\r\n _I can only conclude with expressing my deep gratitude to Mr. Sandow\r\n for the splendid facilities he has offered to those who wish to be\r\n classed as nature’s men (which is indeed the duty of man), and in\r\n doing so I am but echoing the sentiments of many of his pupils._\r\n\r\n  _I have the honour to be,\r\n  Faithfully yours_,\r\n\r\n  JOHN D.

Therefore it is with more than ordinary\r\npleasure that I write this letter to say that with your system of\r\nPhysical Culture this extremely satisfactory result is to be obtained._\r\n\r\n _When first I joined your school some four or five months ago I was\r\n a very fair average specimen of a young Englishman (and our national\r\n thews and sinews are by no means to be despised), but owing, in a\r\n great measure, I suppose, to my city life, I had run a little to seed,\r\n and more than once had required the aid of doctors and tonics. The\r\n advice of the former invariably ended with the same formula, “take\r\n more exercise.”_\r\n\r\n _I was quite ready to agree with them, as during my holidays in the\r\n country, when I was exercising in one form or another nearly the whole\r\n day, I felt quite a different man and as fit as possible._\r\n\r\n _But work in the city is a little difficult to reconcile with plenty\r\n of exercise. Some time previously Mr. Sandow had opened his school\r\n for Physical Culture, and having often admired him and his feats from\r\n afar, I resolved to go to him._\r\n\r\n _I am a business man, and from a business point of view I never did a\r\n better stroke of business in my life._\r\n\r\n _I am a mortal being, and speaking from a human point of view I never\r\n in my life came to a happier conclusion than when I resolved to become\r\n a pupil of the School of Physical Culture. I have increased in girth\r\n and weight without scarcely a superfluous ounce of flesh._\r\n\r\n _My working capabilities and staying powers are all doubled, and what\r\n before was an effort has now become a pleasure. Indigestion, torpid\r\n lassitudes, rasped nerves, and jaded appetite, are to me now unknown\r\n quantities._\r\n\r\n _With splendid appetite, long peaceful nights, and wondrous powers\r\n of vigour and vitality, I can face the world and with a deep sense\r\n of gratitude say, this is what Mr. Sandow and his system of Physical\r\n Culture have done for me._\r\n\r\n _Yours sincerely_, ROLAND HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n _P.S.--I may add I am a pupil at the St. James’s Street School._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST.

I hardly think\r\n that actual figures as to measurements and weight-lifting, give any\r\n adequate idea of the general benefits received by anyone who takes up\r\n Physical Culture thoroughly and puts his back into it._\r\n\r\n _If figures are any guide to you, however, I may quote the following,\r\n which were all taken at your School in Ebury Street._\r\n\r\n _My lung capacity has increased from 283 to 417 cubic inches, my chest\r\n expansion from 39½ to 42¼, thigh from 20½ to 22⅝, and calf from 13⅞ to\r\n 15¼._\r\n\r\n _In weight-lifting I can raise 125 lbs. from the ground with my right\r\n hand above head by means of the body-press, instead of 60 lbs. With\r\n two hands I can jerk 165 lbs. instead of 85 lbs., and I can hold out\r\n at arm’s length with my right hand 45 lbs. instead of 20 lbs._\r\n\r\n _Your system has so generally benefited my whole physique, however,\r\n that I consider my health has improved to an extent far beyond any\r\n actual increase in figures._\r\n\r\n _One of the grandest benefits of Physical Culture is, to my mind, the\r\n increase of will power and general concentration, which can never be\r\n measured in any actual way, but which is bound to appear in after\r\n life, in short becomes an integral part of his character._\r\n\r\n  _Yours truly_,\r\n  CLAUDE BARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  26, GORDON MANSIONS, W.C.,\r\n  _March 21st, 1899_.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. SANDOW,\r\n\r\n _I am glad to be able to say a few words about your system of Physical\r\n Culture. I write feelingly, for I can scarcely express how grateful I\r\n am for what it has done for me. A few years back I became unpleasantly\r\n conscious that a careless disregard for my health was beginning to\r\n unfavourably affect my work before the British public. Notwithstanding\r\n the indulgence shown me by audiences in all the musical centres, I\r\n could not disguise from myself the unpalatable fact that, as a result\r\n of neglecting a cold and getting generally “run down,” my singing\r\n voice was becoming seriously impaired. And so it remained until chance\r\n led me to your school of Physical Culture, and to renew the active\r\n bodily exercise which I had dropped for so long. The result was\r\n eminently satisfactory; I was soon once more able to fulfil my public\r\n engagements with reasonable satisfaction to myself and, I trust, some\r\n pleasure to my audiences. I entirely attribute the return of my powers\r\n to the course I went through on your system._\r\n\r\n _Actors and singers do not need great muscular strength, but they\r\n do most emphatically require health, and, of course, health and\r\n reasonable development go together. No man is such a slave to his\r\n physical condition as the actor or lyric artist. However great his\r\n talent, he cannot give expression to it if the machine be out of\r\n repair; his physical health is obviously his most valuable asset. For\r\n this reason alone I am sure that every member of my profession would\r\n be well advised to get into the way of devoting a few minutes every\r\n day to your exercises. The lyric artist especially would find his\r\n voice improve, his spirits be more exuberant, and his general vitality\r\n at a very much higher level. In addition he would in most cases\r\n discover in a very short time that his figure and limbs were so much\r\n improved that his former expenditure upon lambs-wool tights, padding,\r\n &c., would be entirely obviated._\r\n\r\n _I am_,\r\n  _Yours very faithfully_,\r\n  ALEC MARSH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTINUS SIEVEKING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART II.\r\n\r\n                 INCIDENTS OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandow at the age of ten.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               INCIDENTS\r\n                                 OF MY\r\n                         PROFESSIONAL CAREER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMY CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, as some may think, to be born strong in order\r\nto become strong. Unlike the poet, who, we are told, has to be born\r\na poet, the strong man can make himself. As a child, I was myself\r\nexceedingly delicate. More than once, indeed, my life was despaired\r\nof. Until I was in my tenth year I scarcely knew what strength was.\r\nThen it happened that I saw it in bronze and stone. My father took me\r\nwith him to Italy, and in the art galleries of Rome and Florence I was\r\nstruck with admiration for the finely developed forms of the sculptured\r\nfigures of the athletes of old. I remember asking my father if people\r\nwere as well developed in these modern times. He pointed out that they\r\nwere not, and explained that these were the figures of men who lived\r\nwhen might was right, when men’s own arms were their weapons, and often\r\ntheir lives depended upon their physical strength. Moreover, they knew\r\nnothing of the modern luxuries of civilization, and, besides their\r\ntraining and exercise, their muscles, in the ordinary course of daily\r\nlife, were always being brought prominently into play.\r\n\r\nThe memory of these muscular figures were ever present, and when we\r\nreturned home to Konigsberg I wanted to become strong like them. But\r\nthough I used to try my strength and attend the gymnasium, nothing came\r\nof my desire for some years.\r\n\r\nSo until I was eighteen I remained delicate. At that age I began to\r\nstudy anatomy. It was thus I ascertained the best means of developing\r\nthe body, and invented the system of giving each individual muscle\r\na movement, and of so arranging the form of the exercises that when\r\nsome muscles are brought into play others are relaxed and left without\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen minutes every day was the average time devoted to special\r\nexercise at this period. It may be useful to remark here that no\r\nparticular form of diet was adopted. I ate and drank in the ordinary\r\nway. It may be said at once that I have no belief in special diet; I\r\nhave always eaten and drunk that which my fancy dictated, but I have\r\nalways taken care to avoid anything in the nature of excess. There is\r\nno better guide to good living than moderation. That is a fact I am\r\nalways anxious to impress upon my pupils. Let them be moderate in all\r\nthings, and they need fear no interruption in gaining strength by my\r\nsystem of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The author]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW I CAME TO LONDON AND DEFEATED SAMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years of my life between eighteen and twenty-one may be passed\r\nover with the remark that they saw a steady gain of strength and some\r\noccasional performances as an amateur athlete and wrestler.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 I made the acquaintance of Aubrey Hunt, the artist, who was\r\nthen at Venice. One of the most charming views in the neighbourhood was\r\nto be gained from the grounds of my villa near Ledo. Naturally Mr. Hunt\r\nwished to paint it, and it was a pleasure to be able to afford him the\r\nfacility. One result of our acquaintance was that Mr. Hunt painted me\r\nin the character of a gladiator in the Coliseum at Rome. This picture,\r\nwhich I prize very highly, is to be seen in the reception room at my\r\nSt. James’ Street school. I am told that it is a very striking likeness.\r\n\r\nIt was from Mr. Hunt that I learned that Samson was offering, at the\r\nRoyal Aquarium in London, £100 to the person who could perform the\r\nfeats of his pupil, Cyclops, and £1,000 to anyone who could beat his\r\nown. Mr. Hunt suggested that I should accept the challenge, and it was\r\nmy original intention to come to London with him. It was ultimately\r\ndecided, however, that I should start without delay, and the journey to\r\nEngland was made on the same day that I first heard of the challenge.\r\n\r\nArriving in London at six o’clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Attila,\r\na friend whom I had previously met at Brussels, to ask him to act as\r\ninterpreter, for at that time I was unable to speak English. Mr. Attila\r\nnot only promised his services, but gave me fresh hope by expressing\r\nhis assurance that everything that Samson and his pupil could do I\r\ncould accomplish easily.\r\n\r\nWe determined that the challenge should be accepted that night. With\r\nMr. Albert Fleming to act as agent, we went at once to the Aquarium.\r\nWhen Samson appeared on the stage he gave the usual challenge.\r\nApparently to his surprise, Mr. Fleming accepted it, asking him if he\r\nhad the £100 at hand. Samson replied that there would be no difficulty\r\nabout the money, but Mr. Fleming insisted on seeing it, and the note\r\nwas accordingly produced. Samson was then asked if he had the £1,000\r\nready, and he promised that it would be forthcoming in the event of the\r\ndefeat of his pupil.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary arrangements having been completed, and the note for\r\n£100 handed to Captain Molesworth, the manager of the Aquarium, I\r\nwalked up to the stage. Seeing me in evening dress, the audience were\r\nunable to realise that I stood the slightest chance of defeating the\r\nstrong man and his pupil. They even shouted to Samson not to heed me,\r\nbut to get on with his performance. It seemed evident to them that I\r\nwas unequal to the task that had been undertaken, and Samson himself\r\nburst out laughing when he saw me. The coolness and indifference of\r\nthis first reception in London were not, perhaps, unnatural, for\r\nin evening dress there was nothing, as everyone said at the time,\r\nspecially remarkable about my appearance. But when I took off my\r\ncoat, and the people could see the muscular development, the tone of\r\nindifference changed immediately to surprise and curiosity. Samson and\r\nCyclops themselves shared the general astonishment, though they did not\r\nallow their surprise to be shown for more than a moment, Samson being\r\nheard to remark, “We will beat him, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe first feat which Cyclops performed was to lift over his head two\r\nweights of 56 lbs. each, lowering them with arms fully extended. This\r\nperformance I repeated. Cyclops next took the bar bell, weighing 240\r\nlbs., and with two hands lifted it from the ground over his head.\r\nWhen the audience saw that for the second time the same feat could\r\nbe accomplished with ease they began to cheer; and I repeated the\r\nperformance, after Cyclops, using only one hand.\r\n\r\nAll this time Samson, anxious of the issue, kept asking me in asides in\r\nFrench to let him know my history. As, however, he did not, or would\r\nnot, speak in German, he had to remain in ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe performance proceeded, and now Cyclops took with one hand a\r\ndumb-bell weighing 210lbs., and extending it at arm’s length, bent down\r\nand raised over his head with the other a second dumb-bell, of 100lbs.\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nWhen I repeated this feat, it was thought that the challenge had\r\nbeen won, for this was the end of the performance for which it was\r\nunderstood it was offered. Mr. Fleming, accordingly, asked for the\r\n£100, but Samson refused, saying that the whole performance would have\r\nto be repeated and continued until one of the two competitors gave in.\r\nNothing less would satisfy him as to which of the two was the stronger.\r\nOn this point the audience disagreed, and called on him to hand over\r\nthe money. Appeal was made to Captain Molesworth, who addressing the\r\naudience, promised to see fair play. He could not agree, he said, with\r\nMr. Samson that it was fair that the performance should be continued\r\nuntil one of them dropped from sheer exhaustion, but he suggested that\r\nCyclops should introduce two fresh feats, and that if I could repeat\r\nthem the money should be mine without further question.\r\n\r\nAlthough the audience still maintained that the challenge had been won,\r\nI expressed, through my interpreter, perfect willingness to perform not\r\ntwo only, but twenty more feats, should Cyclops wish to try them.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two extra feats was then taken: Cyclops lying on his\r\nback, raised a weight of 240 lbs. with two men sitting on it, and when\r\nthe men jumped off he himself stood up, raising the weight with him.\r\nThis performance I also repeated.\r\n\r\nNow came the final effort. At the side of the stage stood a great\r\nstone, weighing, I should think, about 500 lbs. On this stone were\r\nsecured the two 56lb. weights. Two chairs were brought, and Cyclops,\r\nstanding on them, in order to get a position above the stone and its\r\nweights, raised the whole load with his middle finger some four inches\r\nabove the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen this performance had been repeated by me, Samson acknowledged\r\nthat that part of the challenge relating to Cyclops had been won, and\r\noffered to hand over the £100.\r\n\r\nMy interpreter then explained that I had not come to London to win\r\nmerely the £100; I had come for the greater sum, the £1,000, in fact,\r\nwhich had been offered to any person who should defeat Samson himself.\r\n\r\nSamson, who was clearly surprised at the issue, replied that he was\r\nnot prepared to meet me that night, and though the public disapproved\r\nof the postponement, it was eventually decided with Captain Molesworth\r\nthat the test should be made on the following Saturday evening.\r\n\r\nThe eventful evening which was to decide the issue between us fell on\r\nthe 2nd of November, 1889. Never, it was said, had the Royal Aquarium\r\nbeen so densely crowded. The people began to arrive as early as two\r\no’clock in the afternoon. When I reached the building, in company with\r\nCaptain Molesworth, Mr. Attila, and Mr. Fleming, twenty minutes before\r\nthe hour announced for the challenge to be taken up, it was literally\r\nimpossible to get through the crowd.\r\n\r\nHere, at the very outset, was a difficulty of a new and an unexpected\r\ncharacter. What was to be done? To try to get through the enormous\r\nthrong in twenty minutes was obviously hopeless. Willing as the crowd\r\nmight be to let us pass it was beyond their power to make way for us.\r\nWe determined, therefore, to go to the stage door, and here a further\r\ndifficulty presented itself. We could not gain admission; no one would\r\nopen the heavy door. The man behind had received the strictest orders\r\nto prevent anyone from entering. In vain did Captain Molesworth implore\r\nhim to let us through, explaining who we were. The man was obdurate.\r\nHe said that he was very sorry, but he failed to recognise Captain\r\nMolesworth’s voice, and he could not disobey explicit instructions.\r\n\r\nAll the time the precious minutes were flying, and the hour when\r\nthe challenge was to be met had actually arrived. It was, indeed, an\r\nanxious and a trying moment. We heard afterwards that when the hour of\r\nthe challenge came and Samson saw that I was not there, he strutted up\r\nand down the stage, exclaiming: “Ah! see, he does not come! I thought\r\nhe would not meet me. I will give him five minutes, nay, ten minutes\r\nmore.” He took out his watch, the minutes were speeding, and still\r\nSamson stood alone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, resolved not to be baffled by this absurd mischance, it was\r\ndetermined that, as fair words would not open the door, strength should\r\nsmash it open. A blow well directed, and the door was burst from its\r\nhinges. The man inside was slightly injured by this rough method, but a\r\nten pound note served to solace Ins feelings, and to heal his wounds.\r\nAnd we--well, we just managed to save the challenge by the space of\r\nhalf-a-minute.\r\n\r\nThe Marquís of Queensberry and Lord de Clifford were appointed judges,\r\nand they examined closely all the bars, bells, weights, and chains\r\nthat were to be used in the performance. Samson first desired that I\r\nshould follow him in some juggling feat with a water bottle, but the\r\njudges decided that this was not in the order of the performance. Only\r\nsuch tests of actual strength as Samson was in the habit of displaying\r\ncould now be allowed. Samson, abiding by this decision, took a large\r\niron bar and bent it over his calf, his arms, and his neck, just as, in\r\na similar way, by striking it on the muscles of the arm, one may bend\r\na poker. The thing is little more than a trick. Of course, muscle is\r\nessential to its successful performance; for if you have no muscle you\r\nwill hit the bone, with the danger of breaking it. Such a performance,\r\nalthough there is a certain knack in doing it gracefully, and with\r\nease, was not difficult to follow.\r\n\r\nSamson next took a wire cable, winding it round his chest, under his\r\narms, and then breaking it. This feat, which is performed by inflating\r\nthe lungs and at the same time contracting the muscles of the chest, I\r\nwas also able to repeat.\r\n\r\nBy the third item in the display it seemed that Samson desired to\r\nleave the issue of the challenge in doubt, for it consisted in snapping\r\na chain which encircled his arm. This armlet, which fitted Samson\r\nwell enough, was too small for me. Fortunately I was prepared for the\r\nemergency. I had ascertained where the chain was bought, and had got\r\nthe same firm to make me an armlet of exactly the same strength, of\r\na size suitable to my larger development. When I produced it, Samson\r\nat first refused to be satisfied that it would be a fair test, but a\r\nrepresentative of the firm who made it stood up in the auditorium and\r\nassured the public that it was of the same strength as that of the\r\nchain made for Samson. The judges examined it, together with the paper\r\nwhich testified to the equality of strength, and decided that the test\r\nwould be perfectly fair and that the performance was to continue. I\r\nplaced the chain on my arm and broke it.\r\n\r\nSamson was still dissatisfied, and I made the offer that if either he\r\nor his pupil, Cyclops, could repeat my performance with a dumb-bell\r\nwhich I had at hand, we would declare the result a draw, and he could\r\nkeep his £1,000. The dumb-bell, which was then brought on to the stage,\r\nweighed 280lbs. With one hand I lifted it up, then laid down, and\r\nfinally stood up with it. After that feat I fastened some chains round\r\nmy arms, then took a dumb-bell weighing 220lbs., raised it to my chest\r\nand burst the chains before releasing it.\r\n\r\n“I have had enough of this,” now exclaimed Samson. “It’s all humbug, I\r\ndon’t call this fair play at all.”\r\n\r\nThe judges, however, were sufficiently satisfied, and Mr. Fleming asked\r\nfor the £1,000. The reply was that it should be paid in the morning,\r\nbut it remains to be added that I never received that £1,000. It was\r\nstated that Samson had taken his money away, and in the end I agreed to\r\naccept £350 from the management of the Aquarium in settlement of the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nWhen we left the Aquarium after the contest the great crowd followed\r\nus cheering, and the four-wheeled cab into which we got, was lifted up\r\nby these enthusiasts. The crowd cheered us all the way to my rooms in\r\nLeicester-square; newspaper men poured in to interview me; and though\r\nI had then no intention of giving performances in public, I was induced\r\nto accept one of numerous offers, of £150 a week, made by a syndicate\r\nof the members of the Lyric Club, and I commenced an engagement at the\r\nAlhambra, giving Mr. Attila £30 a week to assist me.\r\n\r\nI spent three months at the Alhambra, and three months in the\r\nprovinces, and entered into engagements for some years to come.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably ask if special means were adopted during this\r\nand succeeding engagements to maintain my strength. The answer is very\r\nsimple: The performance itself provides the necessary amount of daily\r\ntraining. I eat, drink, smoke, and sleep quite in the ordinary way,\r\ntaking care to observe in all things that guiding rule of moderation to\r\nwhich reference is made in the preceding chapter. I only practice, in\r\norder that grace and perfection may be attained, when some new feat is\r\nintroduced. Personally it may be added, I find that the best time for a\r\nperformance is about three hours after a meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nI MEET GOLIATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first engagement in London and the provinces, I\r\nwent to Germany for a holiday. Driving out one day at Aachen, I met\r\na veritable giant. He was a quarryman, and he was engaged in loading\r\nstones. So huge and extraordinary was his appearance that my horse\r\npositively shied at him.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, this tremendous fellow: his head as huge and\r\ngrotesque as that of any pantomime mask, with a nose the size of an\r\nordinary fist. As for his own fist, it would have made more than three\r\nof mine, and when a five-shilling piece was placed beneath the ball of\r\nhis finger, believe me, it was impossible to see it. So large were his\r\nboots that not only could I get both my feet into one, but I could turn\r\nentirely round inside. And yet, strangely enough, despite his immense\r\nlimbs and body, he was not an extraordinarily tall man. A little more\r\nthan six feet; six feet two-and-a-half inches, in fact, was his height.\r\nHis chest measurement was about eighty inches and his weight 400lbs. He\r\nwas not a fat man in proportion to his size. Quite the contrary. He was\r\nbony and muscular.\r\n\r\nThe thought occurred to me as soon as I saw him that to give him a\r\npart in a performance as a modern Goliath would be, from a popular\r\npoint of view, eminently attractive. I asked him what wages he was\r\nearning. “Five marks a day,” he replied. It appeared that he was given\r\nnearly double the pay of an ordinary labourer because he could lift\r\nheavier weights and load the carts more quickly. I told him that if he\r\nliked to accept an engagement with me I would give him twenty marks\r\na day, whether he worked or not. A German mark, as everyone knows,\r\nis equivalent to an English shilling. The giant quarry man could\r\nscarcely credit such good fortune, and eventually it was agreed that\r\nhe should come to my house to talk the proposal over, and have his\r\nstrength tested. When he came it was found that he could do nothing\r\nmore than lift heavy weights from the floor. He had never put himself\r\ninto training, and his exceptional proportions, which, under different\r\ncircumstances, might have been turned to good account, were of no\r\nspecial use to him. However, it was settled that he should come with\r\nme, and I brought him to England.\r\n\r\nWell do I remember our arrival at Charing Cross. The huge size of\r\nGoliath, whose real name, by the way, was Karl Westphal, attracted\r\nthe most pronounced attention. It was impossible to think of taking\r\na cab, for no cab would have held him, even if he had been able to\r\nget inside it. There was, therefore, nothing for it but to walk to\r\nmy chambers, which were then in Rupert-street, Piccadilly. Thousands\r\nof people followed us the whole way, and Rupert-street was blocked.\r\nA giant, when you have got him, is rather like a white elephant. He\r\nis a rare creature, but it is difficult to know what to do with him.\r\nIt would have been clearly unwise to let him go into the streets, and\r\naccordingly he had to be kept indoors. For seven or eight weeks I tried\r\nto train him, but he proved an idle fellow, and it became evident that\r\nnothing much could be done with him.\r\n\r\nI had an engagement at that time at the Royal Music Hall, and a\r\nperformance was arranged in which Goliath had to surprise me, lumbering\r\nafter me across the stage, and trying to hold me in his grip.\r\n\r\nWe wrestled together, and it was his business to make himself the\r\nvictor. Then, in order to finish me, he took a cannon, weighing\r\n400lbs., and placing it on his broad shoulders, prepared to fire. In\r\na moment or so I returned with the clubs. It was now the turn of the\r\ngiant to show alarm, and gradually he had to retire, with the cannon\r\nstill on his back, into a frame of refuge. I at once climbed to the\r\ntop, and getting into a position above my antagonist, I lifted him,\r\nhis refuge, and his cannon, with one finger, a few inches off the\r\nground. During this part of the performance we fired the cannon, and\r\nthe whole display was brought to a conclusion by placing my arm through\r\na leathern belt which girt his waist, and carrying him at arm’s length\r\noff the stage.\r\n\r\nWhat became of him after he left me I never heard. The last report was\r\nthat he had carried off his own landlady, and that the two had started\r\nsome sort of show together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA PRESENTATION UNDER CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my engagement at the Royal came a holiday in Paris. It was there\r\nI met a very dear school friend, whom I had not seen since I was about\r\nten years of age. My friend’s father was at this time German Consul at\r\nParis. The incident which followed our meeting will be better explained\r\nby prefacing the story with the statement that as boys we were great\r\nbilliard players. We were continually playing at each other’s houses,\r\nand, though we were such mere lads, we could even beat our fathers at\r\nthe game. Nothing, therefore, was more natural than that, when we met,\r\nmy friend should ask me if I was still a good player. As a matter of\r\nfact I was not in practice, but that did not deter us from deciding to\r\ntry our skill. So we went to a room which he selected, and started a\r\ngame. He did not know then that I had made my strength a profession; he\r\nwas rather under the impression that I had followed my father’s desire\r\nand studied medicine. However, the game began, and, as we talked a\r\ngood deal over old times and spoke in German and played rather slowly,\r\nI suppose we unconsciously annoyed a party of Frenchmen. At any rate\r\nthey made unfriendly remarks, and before we had finished our game\r\nthey marked on the slate that they had engaged the table. Wishing to\r\nplay again, we were not disposed to give it up to people whose manner\r\nwas obviously offensive. As our right to continue was disputed, the\r\nattendant was called, and it was pointed out that, according to the\r\nregulations of the establishment, we were perfectly within our rights\r\nin playing a second game. So we played on, and whilst we were joking\r\nand laughing about old times they, it seems, thought we were making fun\r\nof their discomfiture.\r\n\r\nWhen the game was finished we ordered two steaks, which were served\r\nat a table behind the players. We were still laughing over old times\r\nwhen one of the party came up, saying angrily, “I’ve had enough of your\r\nlaughter; if you don’t stop be sure I’ll make you.”\r\n\r\nI told him that I was very sorry that my mood offended him, and if I\r\ncould not laugh at our own personal jokes I should be sorrier still.\r\nIt was added that I did not wish to interfere with him, and it was\r\nsuggested also that he should attend to his own game and leave us alone.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he wished to pick a quarrel. Nor would hot words\r\nsuffice him. Vowing that he must give me something to remember him\r\nby, he struck me across the face. Beneath this fresh insult I tried\r\nto remain quite calm, telling my assailant that it would be certainly\r\nbetter for him to take himself off and leave me alone. But at such\r\ntimes, when the temper is quick, good advice is not heeded; moreover,\r\nhe probably thought he had to deal with some one of poor spirit.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been in his mind the facts are plain: finding that\r\nI took one blow calmly he struck me another and called me coward. My\r\nfriend, who had hitherto kept quiet, now attempted to interfere, but I\r\nheld him down, nearly wrenching his wrist round. The force which was\r\nexerted must have given him an idea of the strength that was ready to\r\nbe used if it were needed, for looking first at his wrist and then at\r\nme, he exclaimed in English, “Why don’t you knock the fellow down?”\r\n\r\n“So you speak English,” said the Frenchmen, “Why don’t you get up\r\nand fight me?” With these words he struck me fiercely on the nose.\r\nThe blood streamed down my clothes, which were spoilt besides by the\r\ngravy that was splashed on them in the disturbance from the dishes. My\r\nappearance must have been deplorable, and as I was that morning wearing\r\na new suit, I lost my patience with the man. I walked slowly towards\r\nhim, and with a quick grip of his neck and knees, I picked him up,\r\nknocked his head and knees together, and banged him down in the centre\r\nof the table. The table broke through, and he fell to the ground. You\r\ncan imagine, I daresay, the scene of wreckage and consternation--the\r\nsmashed table, the man dazed, lying in a heap on the floor, his friends\r\naround him open-mouthed with amazement. In the midst of this scene I\r\nsat down with my friend and smoked a cigar.\r\n\r\nA gendarme was fetched. He entered the room and wanted to arrest me.\r\nThe proprietor caught hold of him, saying, “Be careful, he is an\r\nawful man, he will kill you. You must have some assistance.” Four\r\nmore gendarmes were summoned, and, refusing to take me in a cab, they\r\nmarched me along to the police station. Some of the friends of the\r\nman who was hurt accompanied us and explained to the authorities that\r\nthe regrettable affair was not my fault. They were sorry at what had\r\nhappened, and I was liberated on bail.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they took their injured comrade to the hospital. He was still\r\nunconscious, and in that condition he remained a day and a half. Being\r\nsincerely sorry for the injury I had caused, I called at the hospital\r\nand asked to see him, but he refused.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he recovered, which was not for some weeks, I left Paris to\r\nreturn to London to fulfil an engagement at the Tivoli.\r\n\r\nOne night, whilst I was performing there, the porter brought me a\r\nmessage asking if I would step up to see a gentleman and a party of\r\nfriends in a private box. When I went up I seemed to recognise the\r\nface of the person who wished to see me, but I could not recall where\r\nI had seen it before. The party invited me to take wine with them, and\r\nnothing would satisfy them but my consent to be their guest at supper.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the hotel, my host said: “I perceive, Mr. Sandow, you\r\nhave only pretended that you know me. You do not really recall my\r\nidentity.”\r\n\r\nIt had to be confessed that he was right.\r\n\r\n“If you really knew me,” he proceeded, “you would probably not speak to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked. “I speak to you because I seem to like you, surely\r\nthat is sufficient.”\r\n\r\n“We will see,” he added; “I have come a long way to see you. I have\r\ncome from Paris. I am an amateur in your own line, performing feats of\r\nstrength myself. Of all my friends I have the reputation of being the\r\nstrongest. Having read of your performances in the French and English\r\npapers, I was determined to come to London to see you. I saw the whole\r\nprogramme at the Tivoli to-night, waiting impatiently for your display.\r\nWhen you stepped on to the stage I nearly dropped to the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Why!” I asked, growing curious.\r\n\r\nTears stood in his eyes, as he exclaimed earnestly, “Will you promise\r\nto forgive me, promise me that or I cannot tell you.”\r\n\r\nI told him that I did not know what I had to forgive, but at any rate I\r\npromised to forgive him in advance.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he went on, “if I had known you were Mr. Sandow I would never\r\nhave struck you that blow in Paris;” and then in enthusiastic French\r\nfashion he clung hold of me and kissed me on the cheek--on the cheek\r\nthat he had previously smacked--before all the people.\r\n\r\nOf course, why had I been so blind? This was my assailant of the French\r\nbilliard room. All, however, was now forgiven and forgotten, and as a\r\ntoken of our good understanding he presented me with a handsome gold\r\nwatch. To-day we are the greatest friends, and, whenever I go to Paris,\r\nI stay with him. He is a French Count, but for obvious reasons, not the\r\nleast being that he is my friend, despite the hard knocks which came of\r\nour first meeting, it would not be fair to disclose his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time there were many strong men. Each hall in London could\r\nboast of at least one. It was also a great weight lifting period.\r\nWhen I lifted my heaviest bell, 280lbs., the other strong men put out\r\na placard stating that they were lifting 300lbs. By the time I had\r\npractised sufficiently to raise the weights I was lifting from 280lbs.\r\nto 300lbs., they came out with the statement that they were lifting\r\n320lbs., and so their little game went on.\r\n\r\nFor my part I was determined to introduce a novelty. Henceforth, there\r\nshould be actually living weights. I started, therefore, at the Tivoli\r\nwith a new display, lifting a horse at arm’s length above my head, and\r\nmarching with it to musical accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a display with human dumb-bells. Taking a long\r\nbar with a large ball at each end, I placed in each ball a man, and\r\nI raised bar, balls, and men, slowly over the head. After putting\r\nthem down the balls opened and the men rolled out. This performance I\r\naccomplished in order to equal the feat of lifting 300lbs. dead weight.\r\n\r\nFurther, I lifted, and supported on my chest, a grand pianoforte, with\r\nan orchestra of eight performers on top of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThere was still a fourth feat which I performed, knowing that no one\r\ncould equal it, and that was to turn a somersault whilst holding a\r\nweight of 56lbs. in each hand.\r\n\r\nThese performances I repeated in the provinces. During this tour I had\r\nthe pleasure of visiting not only many of the chief cities of England,\r\nbut also Edinburgh and Glasgow. Who can fail to be deeply impressed\r\nby the grandeur and magnificence of the scenery of Scotland? Certainly\r\nI was not proof against it. Never have I visited a more beautiful city\r\nthan Edinburgh, and the Scottish people themselves I found exceedingly\r\nkind and agreeable. Since then, I have been to Ireland, and can testify\r\nthat its people are as frank, generous, and warm-hearted, as they are\r\nalways represented to be. Certainly, some of the happiest days of my\r\nlife were those spent in the Emerald Isle.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first provincial tour I returned to London to fulfil\r\nan engagement at the Palace Theatre. Here I introduced another novelty.\r\nIn place of the orchestra I held three horses on my chest. These\r\nanimals stood on a plank, one at each side and the third in the centre,\r\nholding the balance in a game of see-saw. Included in this performance\r\nwas the feat in which a Horse Guardsman on his horse rode over me, thus\r\ncompleting at that time the chapter of living weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON THE “ELBE”: BOUND FOR NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the year of the Chicago Exhibition, when I entered into a\r\ncontract for an engagement in America, with Messrs Abbey, Scheffel, and\r\nGrau.\r\n\r\nAn old friend and famous pianist, Martinus Sieveking, whom I knew\r\nyears before in Belgium and Holland, accompanied me to the New World.\r\nSieveking was a brilliant artist, but as a man he was exceedingly weak\r\nand delicate. He had no powers of endurance, and it was difficult for\r\nhim to remain at the piano long at a time.\r\n\r\n“If I had only your strength,” he used to say, “I think I might become\r\nalmost the greatest player in the world.”\r\n\r\nI suggested that he should come with me as my guest to America,\r\nguaranteeing that in nine months or a year, under my personal\r\nsupervision and training, he would grow so strong that his best friends\r\nwould scarcely recognise him.\r\n\r\nAgreeing to come, he travelled with me all through America. The result\r\nof my system and supervision was that his strength grew marvellously.\r\nWithin the year, weak as he was at the start, he became the strongest\r\nof all my pupils, and the most redoubtable amateur I have ever met. The\r\nportrait, which is printed on an earlier page will speak for itself\r\nwhen you remember that a year before it was taken the sitter had a\r\ngaunt, slim, delicate figure, with narrow chest, sloping shoulders, and\r\nno muscles worth speaking about.\r\n\r\nBut I am going ahead too fast. Let us revert for a moment to our\r\ndeparture from England. We sailed on the Elbe, the vessel that was\r\nafterwards wrecked. There was a good deal of bustle in getting on\r\nboard, and some curiosity, I suppose, amongst the passengers, when\r\nthey saw the sailors straining beneath the weight of my luggage and\r\napparatus, and got to know that a strong man was to sail with them.\r\nWith the captain and the first engineer I became very friendly, giving\r\nthem, during the voyage, lessons in my system.\r\n\r\nSomehow I used to feel that the ship we were on was a doomed vessel.\r\nI am not ordinarily superstitious, and it is not necessary to attempt\r\nto account for the feeling, but do what I would I could not shake off\r\nthe dread impression that one day that ship would go down. I became so\r\nfriendly with the engineer, whom I used to visit in his own cabin, that\r\nI advised him to give up his appointment and go to sea no more.\r\n\r\nSome time after that, whilst I was in America, the world was startled\r\nby the news of the Elbe’s disaster. My friend, the engineer, was\r\namongst the few who were saved. He wrote me a letter telling me of\r\nthe tidings. This letter touched me very deeply, and, seeing that it\r\ncontains a story of singular bravery, it may not be inappropriate if I\r\nintroduce here so much of it as I remember.\r\n\r\nHaving commented on the strange fulfilment of my prediction, he\r\ndescribed how, when the boat was going down, the captain lashed\r\nhimself to the bridge, saying he would never leave his ship. From the\r\nengineer’s boat they called to him to come on, but he would not stir.\r\nThen they sent back the pilot, but still to no purpose. By the faint\r\nglimmer of a lantern he pencilled a note which he asked might be sent,\r\nif the bearer should be saved, with his heart’s love to his dear wife\r\nand children. For the last time the pilot left the ship, and as the\r\nboat bore away from its now fast sinking sides the captain from the\r\nbridge, immovable from the post of duty, waved his long farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMY FIRST HOUR IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst experiences are occasionally curious. You shall hear one of mine.\r\n\r\nAlthough the day we reached New York was the hottest that had ever been\r\nknown in that great country of wonderful records, no heat, however\r\nextreme, could detract from the glories of New York Harbour, certainly\r\nthe finest harbour I have ever seen. Numerous people, including, of\r\ncourse, the ubiquitous newspaper men, came on board to welcome me,\r\nbands were playing, and there was a gay and busy time generally.\r\n\r\nHaving landed, I entered a cab. Everyone, I suppose, has a vivid\r\nrecollection of his first cab in America. The independence of the\r\nAmerican cab-driver is sublime. It is something too great for words.\r\nYou can only draw a long breath--and admire it. The particular\r\njourney which I was undertaking would have been in England something\r\nconsiderably less than a shilling fare. Hoping to be generous I\r\nproffered the driver an equivalent in English money to two shillings.\r\nTo my surprise he said, “I guess, Colonel, that’s for myself; your fare\r\nis four dollars”--just eight times as much as I had offered. Of course,\r\nI could not argue with the man. He knew better than I, and there was\r\nnothing for it but to pay promptly what he demanded. Moreover, in\r\nAmerica, it must be remembered, they charge, not for the drive, but for\r\nthe cab.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbey, who met me on the boat, accompanied me to the hotel at\r\nwhich I was to stay. At the office his attention was called away for\r\na moment, and I was left to the tender mercies of the bell boy, a\r\nnigger, who was asked to show me the rooms.\r\n\r\n“Come along, sir,” the boy drawled. And along I went, making my first\r\nacquaintance with an American elevator, in which we were shot up\r\nheavenwards.\r\n\r\n“How high are we?” I asked, as we got out.\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is the sixteenth floor,” replied the boy, in an off-hand\r\nmanner, “you can see if you look down.” I did look down. By Jove, the\r\ndepth down that staircase was tremendous.\r\n\r\nHaving selected my apartments, the boy coolly stood beside me in my own\r\nroom rolling a cigarette and lighting it in my presence. This action\r\nseemed a little impudent, but it was nothing to that which was to come.\r\nRemarking that I desired to wash, I also asked the boy if he would\r\nclean my boots.\r\n\r\n“Clean your boots?” he exclaimed, in blank astonishment, “we don’t do\r\nthat in America, we (speaking of course for himself and the niggers\r\nlike him) don’t clean boots here.”\r\n\r\n“Who then,” I asked, “does clean them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you must go down stairs for that.” And with these words he\r\nreclined on my sofa, rolled another cigarette, and calmly smiled at me.\r\n\r\nThis was really too much for white flesh and blood to bear. I said to\r\nhim sharply, “Look here, young man; I may be a stranger in this country\r\nand ignorant of some of its ways, but I know enough of Americans to be\r\nquite sure that it is not right for you to conduct yourself in this\r\nway. If you don’t promptly clear off I will report you!”\r\n\r\nBut the boy was not easily to be moved. Instead of taking himself off\r\nhe squared up and wanted to fight me. So I just took hold of that boy,\r\nand testing his jacket and trousers to be sure that they would bear the\r\nstrain, I swung him over the sixteenth floor staircase. And there for a\r\nfew moments I held him, just to give him a view of the depth, which was\r\nso tremendous.\r\n\r\nMy word, didn’t that boy shout and scream! I assured him that he\r\nwas quite safe in my hand so long as it was closed, but if he ever\r\nattempted his impertinences again I would bring him to the same spot\r\nand open it. And I reminded him that a drop through sixteen floors\r\nwould not be good even for nigger boys who smoked cigarettes in private\r\nrooms and affected to be indignant at the suggestion that they should\r\nclean a visitor’s boots.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s cries drew a small crowd, including Martinus Sieveking and\r\nthe manager of the hotel. The manager fully agreed with the warning\r\nI gave the boy, and was profuse in his apologies, saying that such\r\nconduct from a bell boy was unprecedented.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN TOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight after my arrival in New York I commenced an engagement at\r\nthe Casino, and after each performance, whilst I was still stripped to\r\nthe waist, I gave lecture on anatomy and my system of physical culture\r\nin my dressing-room. These lectures were attended by many of the most\r\nnotable people in America, the crowded audiences including several\r\nladies. I demonstrated how each feat was accomplished, and let the\r\npeople feel for themselves my muscles, to prove that whilst, when they\r\nwere relaxed they were as soft as butter, when contracted they were as\r\nhard as steel.\r\n\r\nI repeated at the Casino the performances that I had been giving at the\r\nPalace Theatre in London. As my engagement lengthened I grew better\r\nacquainted with the American people, whom, let it frankly be admitted,\r\nI liked immensely. They are wonderfully nice fellows, these Americans.\r\nThe only fault that is to be found with them is the too generous\r\nlength to which their hospitality is liable to go in the direction of\r\ncock-tails. They like to give you a bath of cock-tails, and if a bath\r\nshould not suffice, they would think nothing of making a river for\r\nyou. For a moderate drinker like myself, their generosity is a little\r\nembarrassing, but as the point was emphasised that I could never have\r\nthe assurance to say that I had been to America without tasting a\r\ncock-tail, I at last yielded to their persuasions, and, judging from\r\nthe samples of Manhattan, Martini, and Oyster, which I tried, I am\r\nhound to confess that these drinks are exceedingly nice and that there\r\nis little to beat them. Another striking feature of life in America\r\nis to be found in the trotting horses. They are simply marvellous\r\ncreatures, moving with the ease and almost with the speed of a railway\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nFrom New York I went to Boston, where my system of physical training\r\nbecame very fashionable; and after the Boston visit came Chicago, Mr.\r\nSieveking always accompanying me.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Chicago I went to the Trocadero, where I was to\r\nappear, and inquired for the manager. A tall slim fellow made his\r\nappearance in answer to the inquiry, and for some minutes a game of\r\ncross purposes ensued. For whilst I was not sure whether he really was\r\nthe manager, he doubted whether I was the strong man whom he expected.\r\nAt last, however, I ascertained that he was Mr. Ziegfeld, or at least\r\nMr. Ziegfeld’s son, and he was assured that I was Sandow. He showed me\r\nround the theatre, which was a tremendous place, with accommodation for\r\nfully six thousand people. It had been originally an armoury, and was\r\nused more for concerts than variety entertainments. Mr. Ziegfeld had\r\ntaken it because his other theatre, two days before the opening of the\r\nexhibition, was burned down. At the time of my arrival it was proving\r\ntoo big, but, as good luck would have it, such was the popularity of my\r\nperformances, the building, despite its huge size, was filled nightly.\r\n\r\nIn the exhibition grounds one morning shortly after my arrival, Mr.\r\nZiegfeld suggested that I should drive round in one of the hand wagons.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” I said, “it would never do for a strong man to be\r\npushed round like that, what would the people say?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they don’t know you yet,” replied Mr. Ziegfeld, “you get in and\r\ntry it.”\r\n\r\nIt was no use for me to chaff him by saying that these wagons were\r\nmore suitable for idle fellows of his slim proportions, for inside he\r\nwould have me get. Who of all people in the world should come to push\r\nme round but an unfortunate hunchback! The result was that next morning\r\nthe papers came out with illustrations of the ludicrous scene, with\r\nthe heading “The strong man too strong to walk.”\r\n\r\nAt the termination of the World’s Fair, Mr. Ziegfeld proposed that\r\nI should prolong my tour. I accepted his suggestion, engaged him as\r\nmy manager, and he booked a tour for me, including all the principal\r\ncities. Throughout this tour I offered at each performance ten thousand\r\ndollars to any person who could duplicate my feats of strength or even\r\ndo anything that could be said reasonably to approach them.\r\n\r\nAt St. Louis, one of the greatest beer brewing districts in the world,\r\nthe challenge, I was informed, was to be accepted. The youth who was\r\nprepared to meet me, explained that he was somewhat too stiff to\r\naccomplish all my feats, and I accordingly promised that if he could\r\nrepeat one of them, that was to lift with one hand over his head my\r\nheaviest dumb-bell weighing 300lbs., I would consent to give him the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for him to take up the challenge, he grew alarmed\r\nat the prospect. In answer to my manager’s announcement from the stage\r\nthat we were ready for him, and that the money had been duly deposited,\r\nhe stood up in the auditorium to remark that the challenge was made\r\nonly as an advertisement, he did not believe in it, and he refused to\r\ncome to the stage. With these words he rushed out of the building. His\r\nfriends, who had a good deal of faith in his physical powers, rushed\r\nafter him, and succeeded in bringing him back. In order further to\r\nencourage his drooping spirits my manager offered him the ten thousand\r\ndollars if he would lift the weight over his head with both hands.\r\nBut still he did not like to attempt the task he had before rashly\r\nundertaken. We then reduced the conditions still further, promising\r\nthat if he would lift the weight with two hands even as high as his\r\nshoulders we would still give him the money. His friends now chaffed\r\nand now rallied him, and at last he put his strength to the test; but\r\nlo, this vaunted strong man was a very weak man, for so far from being\r\nable to raise the weight to his shoulders, he succeeded scarcely in\r\nmoving it from the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMY LION FIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest, certainly the most thrilling, of all my\r\nexperiences is that which I am about to relate. It is the story of my\r\nlion fight in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nI was performing in that western city at the time of the mid-winter\r\nfair, which followed the Chicago Exhibition. In connection with\r\nthis fair Colonel Bone was exhibiting a great menagerie. One day he\r\nadvertised a fight to the death between a lion and a bear. A tremendous\r\ntent, with accommodation for twenty thousand people, was erected for\r\nthe occasion. Thousands and thousands of persons had bought tickets,\r\nwhen the police issued an order forbidding the performance, and the\r\nproposed spectacle had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe thought occurred to me that I should take the bear’s place, and\r\nmeasure my strength against the king of the forests. Of course there\r\nis always between the unarmed man and the beast this disadvantage,\r\nthat the beast has natural weapons in his teeth and claws, whilst a\r\nman has nothing to help him in the fight. This lion, moreover, was a\r\nparticularly furious animal. Only a week before he made a meal of his\r\nkeeper. I have met many lions in various places, and this beast was\r\ncertainly the largest and finest of them all. I was fully prepared to\r\nmeet him as he was, provided I could have an equivalent for his claws\r\nin a short dagger or some similar weapon; but the law in America, as\r\nin England, is rightly very stern against cruelty to animals, and the\r\ndagger, of course, could not be allowed. If I desired to meet the beast\r\nthe only way was to fight him as I would box a man, completely unarmed.\r\nAs there is no law to prevent cruelty to men, there was no objection\r\nto this method, though Colonel Bone, as well as my own friends,\r\ninsisted that if there was to be a fight it must be a struggle between\r\nbrute strength and human strength. In short, mittens would have to be\r\nplaced on the lion’s feet to prevent him from tearing me to pieces with\r\nhis claws, and a muzzle would have to be placed over his head. Even\r\nwith these precautions I was advised not to proceed with the contest.\r\n“With his strength,” said Colonel Bone, “he’ll knock your head off.”\r\nBut, personally, I had no fear, I was only anxious for the contest to\r\nbegin. The engagement was accordingly made, and “A lion fight with\r\nSandow” was boldly advertised. The announcement sent a thrill through\r\nthe cities for hundreds of miles around, and in order fully to be\r\nequipped for a performance which would be bound to attract thousands\r\nand thousands of people, I decided to rehearse my fight with the lion\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, preparations were made, and with much difficulty the lion\r\nwas mittened and muzzled. It took several men with lassos and chains\r\nsome hours to perform this operation, for not only had they to guard\r\nagainst the animal’s overpowering strength, but they had to proceed\r\ncautiously in order not to injure him. A great cage, measuring seventy\r\nfeet across, was brought round, and into it Colonel Bone, one of the\r\nmost experienced of lion tamers, let the animal enter. Few people were\r\npresent, but amongst them was my manager, that tall, slim, great,\r\nlittle Ziegfeld, with a face white as snow. There is no doubt that Mr.\r\nZiegfeld and the small company felt the position acutely, for, though\r\npersonally I had confidence in myself--and confidence of victory is\r\nalways half a battle won--yet those around were by no means sure of the\r\nissue, and there was some fear that my first fight with a lion might be\r\nmy last.\r\n\r\nHowever, my purpose being fixed, I entered the cage, unarmed and\r\nstripped to the waist. The lion, with fury in his eyes, crouched down\r\nready to spring. Having read a good deal of the methods of the lion I\r\nwas not unprepared for this form of attack. As he made his last strain\r\nfor a tremendous leap I stepped sharply to the side and he missed his\r\nmark. Turning quickly before he had time fully to recover, I caught\r\nhim round the throat with my left arm, and round the middle with my\r\nright. By this means, though his weight was 530lbs., I lifted him as\r\nhigh as my shoulder, gave him a good hug to assure him that it was\r\nnecessary to respect me, and tossed him on to the floor.\r\n\r\nThus outdone at his first attempt, the lion roared with rage. Rushing\r\nfiercely towards me he raised his huge paw to strike a heavy blow at my\r\nhead. For the moment, feeling the swish of the lion’s paw as it passed\r\nmy face, I really thought that Colonel Bone’s remark that he would\r\nknock my head off would prove true. Luckily I dodged my head just in\r\ntime, and got a good grip round the lion’s body, with my chest touching\r\nhis and his feet over my shoulders. Now came the tussle; the more I\r\nhugged him the more he scratched and tore, and, though his feet were\r\nmittened, he tore through my tights and parts of my skin. But I had got\r\nhim as in a vice, and his efforts to get away were fruitless. Choosing\r\nan opportune moment, I flung him off me, Colonel Bone and my manager\r\nshouting to me to come out of the cage, as I had done enough, and the\r\nlion’s rage was unbounded.\r\n\r\nI was determined, however, before I left to try just one other feat.\r\nMoving away from the lion, I stood with my back towards him, thus\r\ninviting him to jump on me. I had not to wait many moments. He sprang\r\nright on my back. Throwing up my arms I gripped his head, then caught\r\nhim firmly by the neck, and in one motion, shot him clean over my\r\nown head to the ground before me. Colonel Bone rushed into the cage,\r\nsnapping two revolvers to keep the lion off, and I came out, my legs\r\ntorn, my neck bleeding, and with scratches all over my body; but I felt\r\nthat I had mastered that lion, and that I should have little difficulty\r\nin mastering him again at the performance that was to be given next day\r\nin public.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour for the fight came, the huge tent which held twenty\r\nthousand people was literally packed in every part. The cage with the\r\nlion was outside, and whilst he was being mittened and muzzled he\r\nbecame so furious that he broke two iron chains that bound him, and\r\ngot loose. The people shrieked, the very men who a moment before had\r\nbeen boasting of their bravery, were the first to fly, and there was a\r\ngeneral stampede. But the moment the lion saw my eyes fixed fearlessly\r\nand firmly on him he seemed paralysed. Colonel Bone came up and pulled\r\nout his revolver, telling me not to take my eyes off him, as I had him\r\nin my power. Whilst we both remained motionless, the cage was brought\r\nnear his head, and by a dexterous movement I had him over on his back,\r\nand once more he was a prisoner. The keepers tried again to mitten him,\r\nand after a great struggle they succeeded.\r\n\r\nThen came the scene in the arena. The lion appeared first, and as I\r\nentered the whole place shook with cheers and applause. Through the\r\nwhole of that vast assembly ran a thrill of great excitement, and\r\nphotographers were there ready to take instantaneous pictures of the\r\nvarious positions of the fight with the lion. But no sooner did I enter\r\nthe cage than the animal cowered down. He knew that I was his master:\r\nand he refused to fight. Feeling that the audience would be sadly\r\ndisappointed, I tried to goad him on, but nothing would move him. Most\r\nbeasts are cowards at heart, and this lion having met his match at the\r\nrehearsal, refused to budge.\r\n\r\nAt last I caught hold of his tail and twisted it. This was the only\r\nthing that moved him. As he made a bound towards me I dodged, swung\r\nround and picked him up, and then tossed him down. The fight lasted\r\nscarcely two minutes. The lion, recognising that my strength was too\r\nmuch for him, would fight no more. Though I lifted him up and walked\r\nround the arena with him on my shoulders he remained as firm as a rock\r\nand as quiet as a lamb. The fierce fight at the rehearsal had subdued\r\nhis courage. He was clearly conquered. I was afraid that my audience\r\nwould be disappointed with the comparative tameness of the proceedings,\r\nbut, on the contrary, everyone seemed thoroughly satisfied, and “the\r\nlion fight with Sandow” was long the talk of the day in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFURTHER INCIDENTS OF THE TOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of my engagement in San Francisco I organised my own\r\ncompany for a holiday tour in California. What a lovely country is\r\nthat; a country of perpetual summer and blue sky, of bright flowers\r\nand delicious breezes. Well do I remember our arrival in Los Angeles.\r\nThousands and thousands of people came to meet our coach, the children\r\nsmothering us with roses as though it were some battle of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, there were rough journeys in America as well as\r\npleasant ones. On the way to Omaha, for example, we had an experience\r\nof the wilds. At the small villages at which the train stopped it\r\nseemed to be the custom to adjourn for the fifteen or twenty minutes to\r\nthe gambling dens that adjoin the stations. Gambling has never had any\r\nattraction for me personally, but “In Rome one does as Rome does;” and\r\nso in America. Accordingly, we visited one of these gambling houses.\r\nThere is no question about the gambling. You play with dice. Everything\r\nis conducted at lightning speed, and before you know where you are high\r\nstakes have been lost or won--usually, it may be said, they are lost.\r\nIn our case we started, in the few minutes at our disposal, by winning\r\na good deal. Then we lost, and we left that place with our pockets\r\npractically empty. I had lost three hundred dollars, another lost four\r\nhundred, and a third eight hundred.\r\n\r\nDuring the next part of the journey we heard that there was another\r\ngambling house at the station at which we should stop on our way. It\r\nwas in connection, we understood, with that at which we had just lost\r\nour money, and no doubt the manager would be informed by telegram of\r\nthe easy manner in which we had been duped, in order to be prepared\r\nfor our arrival. But we were determined to be even with those gambling\r\nhouse keepers. We agreed at the start not to risk more than five\r\ndollars, and if we won we would depart with our winnings before the\r\nluck, as in the last case, set in against us. For once expectations\r\nwere realised. Precisely the same thing happened. At the beginning we\r\nhad all the luck; we not only recovered what we had previously lost,\r\nbut each of us had a few hundred dollars to the good. Then of a sudden\r\nour luck began to turn. That was the signal. There was six or seven\r\nminutes to spare before the train started, and the manager and his\r\nfriends said “You have lots of time, gentlemen, they will tell you when\r\nthe train’s ready.” Much to their astonishment, however, we insisted on\r\nleaving, and as we walked out with our pockets fairly full the faces\r\nof those men were a study. I think on this occasion we had turned the\r\ntables successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMY DOG SULTAN. END OF THE TOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the tour I will introduce, with the reader’s\r\npermission, my dog Sultan, the holder of seventeen first prizes. This\r\ndog, a handsome boar-hound, standing about thirty-four inches high at\r\nthe shoulders and weighing some two hundred pounds, had been presented\r\nto me as a puppy by Prince Bismarck. Though I have never specially\r\ntrained him, the dog has remarkable intelligence. My companion\r\nthroughout my tour in America, he used to jump into the luggage van\r\nat every journey’s end to find my trunks, and those that were not\r\ntoo heavy for him to lift, he would bring out of the van. A similar\r\nperformance would be repeated when we reached the hotel. Sultan would\r\nhimself carry a good deal of the luggage upstairs, taking it up piece\r\nby piece, and disdaining the assistance of the niggers who would\r\nsometimes offer to give him help. Not unnaturally, he became a great\r\nfavourite wherever we went, and, though it was against the regulations,\r\nthe hotel managers would allow us to have him in our rooms. He would\r\nnever go out without carrying a satchel containing his chain and\r\nmuzzle, a box of pills, two brushes, a tooth brush, a comb, and a few\r\npieces of flannel, which were used for rubbing him down and keeping his\r\ncoat in careful condition. He seemed to know perfectly each of these\r\ncontents, and if one was ever missing he would not be satisfied until\r\nit was found or replaced.\r\n\r\nSultan can carry me very easily. Once in America I sprained my foot.\r\nI happened to be staying at the time at about the only hotel in the\r\ncountry which is not furnished with elevators. My rooms were on the\r\nsecond floor, and that faithful and devoted creature would carry me up\r\nand down stairs before and after each performance, for I was still able\r\nto fulfil my engagements despite the sprain.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar thing about Sultan that, though he will not hurt you,\r\nyet if you enter a room whilst he is in it alone he will never let you\r\nleave until someone has attended to you. As a thief catcher, he is, for\r\nthis reason, unequalled. On one occasion, as you shall hear, during my\r\nAmerican tour, he saved my watch--that watch which was presented to me\r\nby my friend the French count. Whilst I am at the theatre I usually\r\nleave my coat and vest hanging on the wall of my dressing-room, Sultan\r\nbeing left in charge. One night we missed for more than an hour one of\r\nthe stage assistants. When I returned to my dressing-room I was unable\r\nfor the moment to enter. Sultan, it appeared, was blocking the door.\r\nPushing it open I found the missing assistant at the other end of the\r\nroom in a state of some uneasiness. I asked him what he was doing,\r\nand he explained that he had come to see if he could offer me any\r\nassistance. Having entered the room, the dog would not let him move,\r\nand altogether he made out such a piteous tale that I sent him off with\r\nhalf-a-dollar. When, however, I came to look at my things I found that\r\nmy watch, instead of being where I left it, in my vest pocket, was\r\nlying on the table, together with some money which had been taken from\r\nmy pockets. It was then clear that the man’s real object in entering\r\nmy room was not that of assistance, but of robbery. I called him back,\r\nverified my suspicions, and had him immediately discharged. For that\r\nnight’s work we treated Sultan to a special steak for his supper.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately was not the only adventure which I had with this\r\nwatch of which I was so proud. My friend’s gift seemed to be doomed.\r\nWhilst we were at Omaha there was a ball given in the city, and Mrs.\r\nSandow and I were invited to be present. As we should be late in\r\nreturning I told my valet to give Sultan his walk and then to take the\r\ndog home with him for the night. We reached home about half-past two\r\nin the morning, and being tired we went straight to bed. It may be\r\nexplained that our bedroom stood behind the drawing-room, from which\r\nit was entered. Beyond the bedroom was the bathroom, in which I hung my\r\nclothes, leaving my watch and chain in my vest pocket.\r\n\r\nI felt that night, as I felt on the “Elbe,” that something was going\r\nto happen. Owing to this feeling I took the precaution to lock the\r\ndrawing-room door. No one could enter the bedroom without coming\r\nthrough the drawing-room first. We felt, therefore, reasonably secure.\r\nIn addition to my watch and chain, there was Mrs. Sandow’s jewellery,\r\nwhich she had worn at the ball, whilst, amongst other special things, I\r\nhad five twenty dollar pieces, which I had bought because of their rare\r\ndates. These gold pieces I left in my clothes in the bathroom; Mrs.\r\nSandow’s jewellery remained in a drawer in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nThrough the night we slept without disturbance. In the morning the\r\nservant who came to look after our clothes noticed that my watch chain\r\nhad been broken and that my watch was missing. The five twenty dollar\r\npieces were also gone, but Mrs. Sandow’s jewellery was untouched.\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to how she got into the room, the girl said that the door\r\nwas open. Someone had evidently broken into our rooms whilst we slept\r\nand had worked so quietly that they had not disturbed us.\r\n\r\nA detective was called, and it was ascertained that shortly after we\r\nreturned from the ball two well dressed men entered the hotel and\r\nasked for rooms on the first floor. It was then between two and three\r\no’clock. Before five o’clock they left. The detective remarked that\r\nabout that hour two men answering the description that was given had\r\nbeen seen to enter a train, and he thought he would be able to succeed\r\nin tracing them. I told him that if he brought my watch back he should\r\nbe well rewarded.\r\n\r\nWhen the rooms were examined it was found that the door had been\r\nopened by means of an instrument which was pushed through the keyhole\r\nto turn the key. The gas had been half turned on during the night,\r\nand no doubt they saw my watch-chain shining in the uncertain light,\r\nand decided to take those things that they could lay their hands on\r\nmost easily without fear of waking us. It might have been supposed\r\nto be risky work to rob a strong man; but, on the other hand, it was\r\nfound afterwards that the burglar was a desperate fellow, who had just\r\ncompleted nineteen years’ penal servitude for shooting a man who was\r\nunfortunate enough to wake up whilst he was rifling his room.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the two men were arrested. Four of the twenty-dollar\r\npieces were found on them, but the watch was still missing. The men\r\nwere taken before the police authorities, but on the ground that the\r\ncase was not fully proved they were dismissed. After this decision,\r\nthe detective came to me to ask what the watch was worth. Five hundred\r\npounds I told him, in actual money, but for me it had a priceless\r\nvalue, and not for five thousand pounds would I willingly part with it.\r\n\r\n“Seeing that it is worth so much,” he said, “I will try to get it for\r\nyou if you will promise to give me £800.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment I realised the situation; at any rate I felt justified\r\nin believing that this so-called detective was in league with the\r\nburglars, who had themselves owned in court that they knew where the\r\nwatch was, though they refused flatly to give the information. Feeling\r\ndisgusted with a man who could thus play so false and mean a game I\r\ntook him by his neck and trousers and sent him flying through the door.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this I have never seen anything of my watch. It is,\r\nno doubt, lost to me for ever. If I had had my dog with me that night\r\nit would never have been stolen, for no burglar would have got past\r\nSultan, however clever he might be at picking locks.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout my tour I offered medals to those of my pupils who were\r\nable to show the highest developments under my system of physical\r\ntraining. Thousands of applications were received, and the amount of my\r\ncorrespondence was enormous. In the end I arranged a meeting, at which\r\nthe pupils stripped for my personal examination, and there the awards\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\nI received also several challenges during my tour. These challenges\r\nwere frequently made after I had left a city, and as it came to\r\nbe clear that those who made them merely sought advertisement by\r\nassociating their names with mine, I deposited ten thousand dollars\r\nwith the “New York Herald” on the understanding that anyone who\r\nseriously meant business should also make a deposit as a guarantee\r\nof his good faith. If he duplicated my feats of strength the money\r\nwould be his. But though this sum was deposited for about nine months\r\nI never received an answer. No one ever attempted to win that ten\r\nthousand dollars and I have the original cheque, made out to James\r\nGordon-Bennett, to this day. I have had it framed and preserve it as a\r\nmemento.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my first tour in America I returned to England, engaged\r\nfresh talent for my company, and invented and practised some new feats\r\nof strength, including that which I have entitled the Roman horse\r\nexercise, and that in which two people drive over me with a horse and\r\nchariot. Afterwards I paid a short return visit to America, to fulfil\r\ncertain engagements, and then came back again to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMY PERFORMANCE AT THE PRESENT TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be useful, as a record, to indicate briefly the nature of the\r\nsalient features of my recent performance at the London Pavilion, and\r\nsince in the provinces.\r\n\r\nTo begin with there is a tableau, arranged for the purpose of showing\r\nmuscular repose, with all the muscles relaxed; muscular tension, with\r\nall the muscles as firm as steel; the abdominal muscles; the biceps,\r\nmuscles of the inside of the upper arm; the triceps, muscles of the\r\nback of the upper arm; the deltoid, muscles of the shoulders; the\r\ntrapezius muscle, which raises the shoulders; the muscles of the back;\r\nthe action and uses of different muscles; and the chest expansion, from\r\n48ins. normal to 62ins.\r\n\r\nThe tableau curtains are drawn, and the scene changes to the arena.\r\nResting with my neck on one trestle and my heels on another, I hold\r\na 56lb. weight in each hand at arms’ length and support four men\r\nsimultaneously on my body. For the performance of this feat it may be\r\nmentioned that exceptionally strong neck and abdominal muscles are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nTaking a pack of ordinary playing cards I tear them first in half,\r\nthen in four parts, and finally into eighths. Next I tear two packs,\r\nand finally three packs, each pack containing the ordinary number of\r\nfifty-two cards. The feat of tearing in half one pack of cards was\r\noriginally shown to me by the late Emperor of Russia. My reputation as\r\nan amateur had reached his Imperial Majesty, who paid me the honour of\r\ncommanding my presence. During that interview his Majesty, as a test of\r\nhis own manual strength, took a pack of cards and tore it, as I have\r\nsaid, in halves. He had never tried more than the one pack, but as is\r\napparent I have succeeded with three, the torn cards being distributed\r\neach evening amongst the audience.\r\n\r\nAnother feat is performed lying prone on the ground. From this position\r\nI lift with one hand a Roman chariot, rising upright with it and\r\nafterwards lying down again. This feat brings the whole of the muscles\r\ninto play.\r\n\r\nI also introduce my Roman horse exercise. Sitting on a horse and so\r\nbending my back as to throw my head over the animal’s tail I raise at\r\narms’ length heavy weights from the ground. Next I pick up two men,\r\none after the other, raising them over my head and seating them in the\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feat consists of lifting a man from a prone\r\nposition on the ground to the horse’s back, using one hand only.\r\n\r\nAs a concluding feat, I support on my chest a bridge weighing 800 lbs.\r\nOver this bridge two persons drive a horse and chariot, making a total\r\nweight of about 3,200 lbs.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, I conclude my performance by lifting with one hand\r\nat arm’s length a platform upon which rests an ordinary piano, with a\r\nman seated playing upon it. Having lifted it, I march off the stage\r\nwith the lot, the musician playing a lively tune as we go.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to enumerate all my feats here; of course my\r\nperformance has been varied from time to time. But a number of other\r\nfeats have been referred to in the body of the book.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting, perhaps, to add that I have recently composed\r\na musical march, entitled “Marche des Athlètes,” as well as a waltz,\r\n“Sandowia” and other pieces, which musicians have been kind enough to\r\ncommend for their brightness and originality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMY MEASUREMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to the previous chapter it may be stated here, in\r\nanswer to many inquiries, that my own measurements, etc., at the\r\npresent time are as set forth below. The first edition of the book\r\nwas written rather hurriedly, and consequently one or two trifling\r\ninaccuracies crept in. These are now corrected:—\r\n\r\n  Age                32 years.\r\n  Weight             14 stone 6lbs.\r\n  Height             5 feet 9¼ inches.\r\n  Neck               18    inches.\r\n  Chest              48       ”\r\n  Chest expanded     62       ”\r\n  Waist              30       ”\r\n  Hips               42       ”\r\n  Thigh              26       ”\r\n  Knee               14       ”\r\n  Calf               18       ”\r\n  Ankle               8½      ”\r\n  Upper arm          19½      ”\r\n  Forearm            16½      ”\r\n  Wrist               7½      ”\r\n\r\nMy strength, it may be added, is steadily increasing. If some one had\r\ntold me two years ago that I should be able to perform the feats of\r\nstrength that I now accomplish I would not have believed it. I feel\r\nsure, moreover, that in the natural course of things, my strength will\r\ncontinue to increase. With careful training the bodily strength ought\r\nto increase steadily until the forty-fifth year is reached.\r\n\r\nThe above appeared in the first edition. Pupils will be glad to hear\r\nthat my belief has been fully justified, and that even since the book\r\nwas first published, some eighteen months ago, there has been a very\r\nmaterial increase in my strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE THEORY\r\n                                  OF\r\n                          PHYSICAL EDUCATION\r\n                                  IN\r\n                          ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n                                  BY\r\n                          THOMAS CHESTERTON,\r\n\r\n_Organizing Teacher of Physical Education to the London School Board_.\r\n\r\n           LATE CHIEF INSTRUCTOR AT THE ALDERSHOT GYMNASIUM.\r\n\r\n      _Author of Manual of Drill & Physical Exercises, &c., &c._\r\n\r\nFirst-Class (Advanced) Certificates for Physiology and Hygiene from the\r\n                 Science Department, South Kensington.\r\n\r\n        _Founder of the British College of Physical Education._\r\n\r\n                            ———————————————\r\n\r\n                           WITH A PREFACE BY\r\n\r\n                         COLONEL G.

In prescribing\r\nexercises for my pupils I am compelled to trust entirely to them as\r\nto the amount of will-power used whilst exercising. They may work\r\nenergetically or slovenly according to their condition, but how they\r\nwork is beyond my knowledge or control.\r\n\r\nHow to combat this has long engaged my attention, and after long\r\nyears of study and experiment I have at last discovered a Dumb-bell\r\nwhich absolutely compels the pupil to throw the necessary amount of\r\nwill-power into his work.\r\n\r\nThis appliance is very simple, and cannot go out of order. It consists\r\nof a Dumb-bell made in two halves, separated about 1½ inches from one\r\nanother, the intervening space being occupied by small steel springs,\r\nwhich may be of any strength.\r\n\r\nWhen exercising, the springs are compressed by gripping the Bells, and\r\nbringing the two halves close together, in which position they are kept\r\nuntil the exercise is over.\r\n\r\nThe pupil who possesses these Bells will find that instead of having\r\nto be continually buying heavier Dumb-bells, one pair will suffice him\r\nfor all time. All that it will be necessary for him to do will be to\r\npurchase, at a small expense, new springs from time to time. All pupils\r\nare advised to use the “Grip” Dumb-bell upon the merits of which I need\r\nnot enlarge.\r\n\r\nI have always taught that muscle is developed by will-power, not by\r\nmechanical movement, and the simple principle of this latest invention\r\nis, by calling forth a continual exercise of will-power to obtain\r\nresults impossible with any previous Dumb-bell.\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  _Eugen Sandow_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDOW’S SCHOOLS OF PHYSICAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n_Central Offices_—=Sandow Hall, Savoy Corner, Victoria Embankment, W.C.=\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON ESTABLISHMENTS:\r\n\r\n =32, St. James’s Street, London, S.W.=--Chief West End School.

The\r\n mystery with which it deals is almost an unsolvable puzzle, and the\r\n writing is far and above what we have been accustomed to in this sort\r\n of book. It is rumoured that a dramatised version will shortly be seen\r\n on the London boards, and we are glad of it, for a novel which lends\r\n itself better to adaptation to the stage we have never seen.”—_Man of\r\n the World._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “HOUSE” ON SPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work consists of 41 Articles, written by members of the Stock\r\nExchange on the branch of Sport with which they have particularly\r\nidentified themselves. For full list of contents see next page.\r\n\r\nThe work makes a handsome large octavo volume of 470 pages, printed\r\non Art Paper and profusely illustrated by over 230 Half-Tone Process\r\nBlocks reproduced from photographs and drawings, many having been\r\nspecially taken and designed for the work, the photographs of all the\r\nAuthors being included.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece is a beautifully printed photogravure of “A Group,”\r\nconsisting of “Persimmon” in Egerton House Paddocks, with Watts up,\r\ndressed in the Royal Colours, H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, and his\r\ntrainer, Richard Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe profit derived from the sale of the book will be in aid of “THE\r\nREFEREE” CHILDREN’S DINNER FUND; already a cheque for (£1000) ONE\r\nTHOUSAND POUNDS has been forwarded to the Fund and acknowledged in the\r\ncolumns of _The Referee_, on January 15th, 1899.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness The Prince of Wales has accepted a copy of the work\r\nand graciously expressed his appreciation of same.\r\n\r\nThe book can be obtained from all Booksellers or from the Publishers.\r\n\r\nPRICE 21/-NETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE PRESS SAYS.\r\n\r\nFrom the TIMES, January, 1899.\r\n\r\n Not the members of the House of Commons but those of the Stock\r\n Exchange are responsible for the collection of articles upon sports\r\n and pastimes and the collection of records published under the title\r\n THE “HOUSE” ON SPORT and edited by Mr. W. A. Morgan. Of its success\r\n the names of the contributors are almost a certain guarantee, for\r\n the greater number of them are, or have been in their day, among the\r\n most celebrated exponents of the sports and pastimes upon which they\r\n discourse. It is impossible to name all the writers, but a selection\r\n will serve the purpose of showing the authority and experience\r\n with which these gentlemen write. Mr. W. M. Chinnery treats of\r\n Athletic Sports and Athletes--his achievements on the running path\r\n in the ’sixties were great. Mr. B. J. Angle, a veteran enthusiast,\r\n contributes a very interesting article on “The Noble Art,” in which\r\n will be found not only the records of the prowess of fighters of old\r\n time but also the keen criticism of an expert upon the modern style\r\n of boxing as compared with the old time method. * * * Of Cricket,\r\n Messrs. Gregor MacGregor and C. Carlos Clarke write; and of Cycling\r\n Mr. G. Lacy Hillier, acknowledged to be the highest authority, gives\r\n the history, to which he adds useful suggestions. * * * The various\r\n epochs of Rugby Football fall into the hands of Messrs. W. Maclagan,\r\n G. L. Jeffery, and A. Spurling, and Mr. S. Mure Fergusson has a useful\r\n little essay on Golf. Still one well-known name follows another until\r\n the reader begins to think that the Stock Exchange is the very home\r\n of sport. * * * The articles likely to attract the greatest share of\r\n attention are those dealing with Metropolitan and University Rowing\r\n and on Sculling. Mr. Morgan had, no doubt, plenty of talent to choose\r\n from. But to have been able to collect in one volume the views of\r\n Messrs. S. Le Blanc Smith, F. I. Pitman, S. D. Muttlebury, Reginald\r\n P. P. Rowe, and Guy Nickalls is a real triumph. That which they do\r\n not know of oarsmanship is not worth knowing. * * * Many articles\r\n have been passed over of necessity, but enough has been written to\r\n show that this is a pleasant and useful book, the work of men who\r\n speak from experience; it is generously illustrated, mainly with good\r\n reproductions of photographs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “HOUSE” ON SPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n        PAGE\r\n\r\n  ARCHERY      By F.
