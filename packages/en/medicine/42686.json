J. CLAY, M.A. AND SONS,\r\n  AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title and contents-table of this volume will show sufficiently its\r\nscope, and a glance at the references in the several chapters will show\r\nits sources. But it may be convenient to premise a few general remarks\r\nunder each of those heads. The date 664 A.D. has been chosen as a\r\nstarting-point, for the reason that it is the year of the first pestilence\r\nin Britain recorded on contemporary or almost contemporary authority, that\r\nof Beda’s ‘Ecclesiastical History.’ The other limit of the volume, the\r\nextinction of plague in 1665-66, marks the end of a long era of epidemic\r\nsickness, which differed much in character from the era next following. At\r\nor near the Restoration we come, as it were, to the opening of a new seal\r\nor the outpouring of another vial. The history proceeds thenceforth on\r\nother lines and comes largely from sources of another kind; allowing for a\r\nlittle overlapping about the middle of the seventeenth century, it might\r\nbe continued from 1666 almost without reference to what had gone before.\r\nThe history is confined to Great Britain and Ireland, except in Chapter\r\nXI. which is occupied with the first Colonies and the early voyages,\r\nexcepting also certain sections of other chapters, where the history has\r\nto trace the antecedents of some great epidemic sickness on a foreign\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the work have been the ordinary first-hand sources of\r\nEnglish history in general. In the medieval period these include the\r\nmonastic histories, chronicles, lives, or the like (partly in the editions\r\nof Gale, Savile, Twysden, and Hearne, and of the English Historical\r\nSociety, but chiefly in the great series edited for the Master of the\r\nRolls), the older printed collections of State documents, and, for the\r\nBlack Death, the recently published researches upon the rolls of manor\r\ncourts and upon other records. From near the beginning of the Tudor\r\nperiod, the Calendars of State Papers (Domestic, Foreign, and Colonial),\r\nbecome an invaluable source of information for the epidemiologist just as\r\nfor other historians. Also the Reports of the Historical Manuscripts\r\nCommission, together with its Calendars of private collections of papers,\r\nhave yielded a good many facts. Many exact data, relating more\r\nparticularly to local outbreaks of plague, have been found in the county,\r\nborough, and parish histories, which are of very unequal value for the\r\npurpose and are often sadly to seek in the matter of an index. The\r\nmiscellaneous sources drawn upon have been very numerous, perhaps more\r\nnumerous, from the nature of the subject, than in most other branches of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMedical books proper are hardly available for a history of English\r\nepidemics until the Elizabethan period, and they do not begin to be really\r\nimportant for the purpose until shortly before the date at which the\r\npresent history ends. These have been carefully sought for, most of the\r\nknown books having been met with and examined closely for illustrative\r\nfacts. In the latter part of the seventeenth century the best English\r\nwriters on medicine occupied themselves largely with the epidemics of\r\ntheir own time, and the British school of epidemiology, which took a\r\ndistinguished start with Willis, Sydenham and Morton, was worthily\r\ncontinued by many writers throughout the eighteenth century; so that the\r\nhistory subsequent to the period here treated of becomes more and more\r\ndependent upon medical sources, and of more special interest to the\r\nprofession itself.\r\n\r\nReference has been made not unfrequently to manuscripts; of which the more\r\nimportant that have been used (for the first time) are a treatise on the\r\nSweating Sickness of 1485 by a contemporary physician in London, two\r\noriginal London plague-bills of the reign of Henry VIII., and a valuable\r\nset of tables of the weekly burials and christenings in London for five\r\nyears (almost complete) from 1578 to 1583, among the Cecil papers--these\r\nlast by kind permission of the Marquis of Salisbury.\r\n\r\nCollecting materials for a British epidemiology from these various sources\r\nis not an easy task; had it been so, it would hardly have been left to be\r\ndone, or, so far as one knows, even attempted, for the first time at so\r\nlate a period. Where the sources of information are so dispersed and\r\ncasual it is inevitable that some things should have been overlooked: be\r\nthe omissions few or many, they would certainly have been more but for\r\nsuggestions and assistance kindly given from time to time by various\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe materials being collected, it remained to consider how best to use\r\nthem. The existing national epidemiologies, such as that of Italy by\r\nProfessor Corradi or the older ‘Epidemiologia Española’ of Villalba, are\r\nin the form of Annals. But it seemed practicable, without sacrificing a\r\nsingle item of the chronology, to construct from the greater events of\r\nsickness in the national annals a systematic history that should touch and\r\nconnect with the general history at many points and make a volume\r\nsupplementary to the same. Such has been the attempt; and in estimating\r\nthe measure of its success it may be kept in mind that it is the first of\r\nthe kind, British or foreign, in its own department. The author can hardly\r\nhope to have altogether escaped errors in touching upon the general\r\nhistory of the country over so long a period; but he has endeavoured to go\r\nas little as possible outside his proper province and to avoid making\r\ngratuitous reflections upon historical characters and events. The greater\r\nepidemic diseases have, however, been discussed freely--from the\r\nscientific side or from the point of view of their theory.\r\n\r\nIt remains to acknowledge the liberality of the Syndics of the Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press in the matter of publication, and the friendly interest\r\ntaken in the work by their Chairman, the Master of Peterhouse.\r\n\r\n_November,

The period of Antiquity may be taken as concluded by the fourth\r\nChristian century, or by the fifth or by the sixth; the Modern period may\r\nbe made to commence in the fourteenth, or in the fifteenth or in the\r\nsixteenth. The historian Hallam includes a thousand years in the medieval\r\nperiod, from the invasion of France by Clovis to the invasion of Italy by\r\nCharles VIII. in 1494. We begin, he says, in darkness and calamity, and we\r\nbreak off as the morning breathes upon us and the twilight reddens into\r\nthe lustre of day. To the epidemiologist the medieval period is rounded\r\nmore definitely. At the one end comes the great plague in the reign of\r\nJustinian, and at the other end the Black Death. Those are the two\r\ngreatest pestilences in recorded history; each has no parallel except in\r\nthe other. They were in the march of events, and should not be fixed upon\r\nas doing more than their share in shaping the course of history. But no\r\nsingle thing stands out more clearly as the stroke of fate in bringing the\r\nancient civilization to an end than the vast depopulation and solitude\r\nmade by the plague which came with the corn-ships from Egypt to Byzantium\r\nin the year 543; and nothing marks so definitely the emergence of Europe\r\nfrom the middle period of stagnation as the other depopulation and social\r\nupheaval made by the plague which came in the overland track of Genoese\r\nand Venetian traders from China in the year 1347. While many other\r\ninfluences were in the air to determine the oncoming and the offgoing of\r\nthe middle darkness, those two world-wide pestilences were singular in\r\ntheir respective effects: of the one, we may say that it turned the key of\r\nthe medieval prison-house; and of the other, that it unlocked the door\r\nafter eight hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death and its after-effects will occupy a large part of this\r\nwork, so that what has just been said of it will not stand as a bare\r\nassertion. But the plague in the reign of Justinian hardly touches British\r\nhistory, and must be left with a brief reference. Gibbon was not\r\ninsensible of the part that it played in the great drama of his history.\r\n“There was,” he says, “a visible decrease of the human species, which has\r\nnever been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the globe.” After\r\nvainly trying to construe the arithmetic of Procopius, who was a witness\r\nof the calamity at Byzantium, he agrees to strike off one or more ciphers,\r\nand adopts as an estimate “not wholly inadmissible,” a mortality of one\r\nhundred millions. The effects of that depopulation, in part due to war,\r\nare not followed in the history. So far as Gibbon’s method could go, the\r\nplague came for him into the same group of phenomena as comets and\r\nearthquakes; it was part of the stage scenery amidst which the drama of\r\nemperors, pontiffs, generals, eunuchs, Theodoras, and adventurers\r\nproceeded. Even of the comets and earthquakes, he remarks that they were\r\nsubject to physical laws; and it was from no want of scientific spirit\r\nthat he omitted to show how a plague of such magnitude had a place in the\r\nphysical order, and not less in the moral order.\r\n\r\nA new science of epidemiology has sprung up since the time of Gibbon, who\r\nhad to depend on the writings of Mead, a busy and not very profound Court\r\nphysician. More particularly the Egyptian origin of the plague of the\r\nsixth century, and its significance, have been elucidated by the brilliant\r\ntheory of Pariset, of which some account will be given at the end of the\r\nchapter on the Black Death. For the present, we are concerned with it only\r\nin so far as it may have a bearing upon the pestilences of Britain. The\r\nplague of the sixth century made the greatest impression, naturally, upon\r\nthe oldest civilized countries of Europe; but it extended also to the\r\noutlying provinces of the empire, and to the countries of the barbarians.\r\nIt was the same disease as the Black Death of the fourteenth century, the\r\nbubo-plague; and it spread from country to country, and lasted from\r\ngeneration to generation, as that more familiar infection is known to have\r\ndone[1].\r\n\r\nRenewals of it are heard of in one part of Europe or another until the end\r\nof the sixth century, when its continuity is lost. But it is clear that\r\nthe seeds of pestilence were not wanting in Rome and elsewhere in the\r\ncenturies following. Thus, about the year 668, the English\r\narchbishop-elect, Vighard, having gone to Rome to get his election\r\nconfirmed by the Pope Vitalianus, was shortly after his arrival cut off by\r\npestilence, with almost all who had gone with him[2]. Twelve years after,\r\nin 680, there was another severe pestilence in the months of July, August\r\nand September, causing a great mortality at Rome, and such panic at Pavia\r\nthat the inhabitants fled to the mountains[3]. In 746 a pestilence is said\r\nto have advanced from Sicily and Calabria, and to have made such\r\ndevastation in Rome that there were houses without a single inhabitant\r\nleft[4]. The common name for all such epidemics is _pestis_ or\r\n_pestilentia_ or _magna mortalitas_, so that it is open to contend that\r\nsome other type than bubo-plague, such as fever or flux, may have been at\r\nleast a part of them; but no type of infection has ever been so mortal as\r\nthe bubo-plague, and a mortality that is distinguished by a chronicler as\r\ncausing panic and devastation was presumably of that type.\r\n\r\n\r\nPestilence in England and Ireland in the Seventh Century.\r\n\r\nIt is more than a century after the first great wave of pestilence had\r\npassed over Europe in the reign of Justinian, before we hear of a great\r\nplague in England and Ireland. Dr Willan, the one English writer on\r\nmedicine who has turned his erudition to that period, conjectures that the\r\ninfection must have come to this country from the continent at an earlier\r\ndate. From the year 597, he says, the progress of conversion to the\r\nChristian religion “led to such frequent intercourse with Italy, France\r\nand Belgium, that the epidemical and contagious disease prevailing on the\r\ncontinent at the close of the sixth century must necessarily be\r\ncommunicated from time to time through the Heptarchy[5].” Until we come to\r\nthe _Ecclesiastical History_ of Beda, the only authorities are the Irish\r\nannals; and in them, the first undoubted entry of a great plague\r\ncorresponds in date with that of Beda’s history, the year 664. It is true,\r\nindeed, that the Irish annals, or the later recensions of them, carry the\r\nname that was given to the plague of 664 (_pestis ictericia_ or _buide\r\nconnaill_) back to an alleged mortality in 543, or 548, and make the\r\nlatter the “first _buide connaill_”; but the obituary of saints on that\r\noccasion is merely what might have occurred in the ordinary way, and it is\r\nprobable, from the form of entry, that it was really the rumour of the\r\ngreat plague at Byzantium and elsewhere in 543 and subsequent years that\r\nhad reached the Irish annalist[6].\r\n\r\nThe plague of 664 is the only epidemic in early British annals that can be\r\nregarded as a plague of the same nature, and on the same great scale, as\r\nthe devastation of the continent of Europe more than a century earlier,\r\nwhether it be taken to be a late offshoot of that or not. The English\r\npestilence of 664 is the same that was fabled long after in prose and\r\nverse as the great plague “of Cadwallader’s time.” It left a mark on the\r\ntraditions of England, which may be taken as an index of its reality and\r\nits severity; and with it the history of epidemics in Britain may be said\r\nto begin. It was still sufficiently recent to have been narrated by\r\neyewitnesses to Beda, whose _Ecclesiastical History_ is the one authentic\r\nsource, besides the entry in the Irish annals, of our information\r\nconcerning it.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence broke out suddenly in the year 664, and after\r\n“depopulating” the southern parts of England, seized upon the province of\r\nNorthumbria, where it raged for a long time far and wide, destroying an\r\nimmense multitude of people[7]. In another passage Beda says that the same\r\nmortality occurred also among the East Saxons, and he appears to connect\r\ntherewith their lapse to paganism[8].\r\n\r\nThe epidemic is said to have entered Ireland at the beginning of August,\r\nbut whether in 664 or 665 is not clear. According to one of those vague\r\nestimates which we shall find again in connexion with the Black Death, the\r\nmortality in Ireland was so vast that only a third part of the people were\r\nleft alive. The Irish annals do, however, contain a long list of notables\r\nwho died in the pestilence[9].\r\n\r\nBeda follows his general reference to the plague by a story of the\r\nmonastery of Rathmelsigi, identified with Melfont in Meath, which he\r\nheard many years after from the chief actor in it. Egbert, an English\r\nyouth of noble birth, had gone to Ireland to lead the monastic life, like\r\nmany more of his countrymen of the same rank or of the middle class. The\r\nplague in his monastery had been so severe that all the monks either were\r\ndead of it or had fled before it, save himself and another, who were both\r\nlying sick of the disease. Egbert’s companion died; and he himself, having\r\nvowed to lead a life of austerity if he were spared, survived to give\r\neffect to his vow and died in the year 729 with a great name for sanctity\r\nat the age of ninety.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 664 is said, perhaps on constructive evidence[10], to have\r\ncontinued in England and Ireland for twenty years; and there are several\r\nstories told by Beda of incidents in monasteries which show, at least,\r\nthat outbreaks of a fatal infection occurred here or there as late as 685.\r\nSeveral of these relate to the new monastery of Barking in Essex, founded\r\nfor monks and nuns by a bishop of London in 676. First we have a story\r\nrelating to many deaths on the male side of the house[11], and then two\r\nstories in which a child of three and certain nuns figure as dying of the\r\npestilence[12]. Another story appears to relate to the plague in a\r\nmonastery on the Sussex coast, seemingly Selsea[13]. Still another, in\r\nwhich Beda himself is supposed to have played a part, is told of the\r\nmonastery of Jarrow, the date of it being deducible from the context as\r\nthe year 685.\r\n\r\nOf the two Northumbrian monasteries founded by Benedict, that of Wearmouth\r\nlost several of its monks by the plague, as well as its abbot Easterwine,\r\nwho is otherwise known to have died in March, 685. The other monastery of\r\nJarrow, of which Ceolfrith was abbot, was even more reduced by the\r\npestilence. All who could read, or preach, or say the antiphonies and\r\nresponses were cut off, excepting the abbot and one little boy whom\r\nCeolfrith had brought up and taught. For a week the abbot conducted the\r\nshortened services by himself, after which he was joined by the voice of\r\nthe boy; and these two carried on the work until others had been\r\ninstructed. Beda, who is known to have been a pupil of Ceolfrith’s at\r\nJarrow, would then have been about twelve years old, and would correspond\r\nto the boy in the story[14].\r\n\r\nThe nature of these plagues, beginning with the great invasion of 664, can\r\nonly be guessed. They have the look of having been due to some poison in\r\nthe soil, running hither and thither, as the Black Death did seven\r\ncenturies after, and remaining in the country to break out afresh, not\r\nuniversally as at first, but here and there, as in monasteries. The\r\nhypothesis of a late extension to England and Ireland of the great\r\nEuropean invasion of bubo-plague in 543, would suit the facts so far as we\r\nknow them. The one medical detail which has been preserved, on doubtful\r\nauthority, that the disease was a _pestis ictericia_, marked by yellowness\r\nof the skin, and colloquially known in the Irish language as _buide\r\nconnaill_, is not incompatible with the hypothesis of bubo-plague, and is\r\notherwise unintelligible[15].\r\n\r\nFor the next seven centuries, the pestilences of Britain are mainly the\r\nresults of famine and are therefore of indigenous origin. So strongly is\r\nthe type of famine-pestilence impressed upon the epidemic history of\r\nmedieval England that the chroniclers and romancists are unable to\r\ndissociate famine from their ideas of pestilence in general. Thus Higden,\r\nin his reference to the outbreak of the Justinian plague at\r\nConstantinople, associates it with famine alone[16]; and the metrical\r\nromancist, Robert of Brunne, who had the great English famine of 1315-16\r\nfresh in his memory, describes circumstantially the plague of 664 or the\r\nplague of Cadwallader’s time, as a famine-pestilence, his details being\r\ntaken in part from the account given by Simeon of Durham of the harrying\r\nof Yorkshire by William the Conqueror, and in part, doubtless, from his\r\nown recent experience of a great English famine[17]. But before we come to\r\nthese typical famine-pestilences of Britain, which fill the medieval\r\ninterval between the foreign invasion of plague in Beda’s time and the\r\nforeign invasion of 1348, it remains to dispose in this place of those\r\noutbreaks on English soil which do not bear the marks of famine-sickness,\r\nbut, on the other hand, the marks of a virulent infection arising at\r\nparticular spots probably from a tainted soil. These have to be collected\r\nfrom casual notices in the most unlikely corners of monastic chronicles;\r\nbut it is just the casual nature of the references that makes them\r\ncredible, and leads one to suppose that the recorded instances are only\r\nsamples of epidemics not altogether rare in the medieval life of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Epidemics not connected with Famine.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these is mentioned in the annals of the priory of Christ\r\nChurch, Canterbury. In the year 829, all the monks save five are said to\r\nhave died of pestilence, so that the monastery was left almost desolate.\r\nThe archbishop Ceolnoth, who was also the abbot of the monastery, filled\r\nup the vacancies with secular clerks, and he is said to have done so with\r\nthe consent of the five monks “that did outlive the plague.” The incident\r\ncomes into the Canterbury MS. of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle[18] under the\r\nyear 870, in connexion with the death of Ceolnoth and the action of his\r\nsuccessor in expelling the seculars and completing the original number of\r\nregulars. So far as the records inform us, that great mortality within the\r\npriory of Christ Church two centuries after it was founded by Augustine,\r\nwas an isolated event; the nearest general epidemic to it in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle was a great mortality of man and beast about the\r\nyear 897 following the Danish invasion which Alfred at length repelled.\r\n\r\nThat such deadly intramural epidemics in monasteries were not impossible\r\nis conclusively proved by the authentic particulars of a sudden and severe\r\nmortality among the rich monks of Croyland at a much more recent\r\ndate--between the years 1304 and 1315. In the appendix to the chronicle of\r\nRamsey Abbey[19] there is printed a letter from Simon, abbot of Croyland,\r\nwithout date but falling between the years above given, addressed to his\r\nneighbours the abbots of Ramsey, Peterborough and Thorney, and the prior\r\nof Spalding. The letter is to ask their prayers on the occasion of the\r\nsudden death of thirteen of the monks of Croyland and the sickness of\r\nothers; that large number of the brethren had been cut off within fifteen\r\ndays--“potius violenter rapti quam fataliter resoluti[20].” The letter is\r\nwritten from Daddington, whither abbot Simon had doubtless gone to escape\r\nthe infection.\r\n\r\nThese are two instances of deadly epidemics within the walls of English\r\nmonasteries. In the plague-years 664-685, and long after in the Black\r\nDeath, the mortalities among the monks were of the same degree, only there\r\nwas an easy explanation of them, in one if not in both cases, as being\r\npart of an imported infection universally diffused in English soil. What\r\nthe nature of the occasional outbreaks in earlier times may have been, we\r\ncan only guess: something almost as deadly, we may say, as the plague\r\nitself, and equally sudden. The experience was not peculiar to England. An\r\nincident at Rome almost identical with that of Vighard in 668 is related\r\nin a letter sent home in 1188, by Honorius the prior of Canterbury, who\r\nhad gone with others of the abbey on a mission to Rome to obtain judgment\r\nin a dispute between the archbishop and the abbey, that the whole of his\r\nfollowing was stricken with sickness and that five were dead. John de\r\nBremble, who being also abroad was ordered to go to the help of the prior,\r\nwrote home to the abbey that when he reached Rome only one of the brethren\r\nwas alive, and he in great danger, and that the first thing he had to do\r\non his arrival was to attend the cook’s funeral[21].\r\n\r\nThere is no clue to the type of these fatal outbreaks of sickness within\r\nmonastic communities. One naturally thinks of a soil-poison fermenting\r\nwithin and around the monastery walls, and striking down the inmates by a\r\ncommon influence as if at one blow. There are in the medieval history\r\nprevious to the Black Death a few instances of local pestilences among the\r\ncommon people also, which differ from the ordinary famine-sicknesses of\r\nthe time. The most significant of these is a story told by William of\r\nNewburgh at the end of his chronicle and probably dating from the\r\ncorresponding period, about the year 1196[22]. For several years there had\r\nbeen, as we shall see, famine and fever in England; but the particular\r\nincident does not relate to the famine, although it may join on to it. It\r\nis the story of a ghost walking, and it comes from the village of Annan on\r\nthe Solway, having been related to the monk of Newburgh in Yorkshire by\r\none who had been an actor in it. A man who had fled from Yorkshire and\r\ntaken refuge in the village under the castle of Annan, was killed in a\r\nquarrel about the woman whom he had married, and was buried without the\r\nrites of the church. His unquiet ghost walked, and his corpse tainted the\r\nair of the village; pestilence was in every house, so that the place which\r\nhad been populous looked as if deserted, those who escaped the plague\r\nhaving fled. William of Newburgh’s informant had been in the midst of\r\nthese calamities, and had taken a lead in mitigating them; he had gone to\r\ncertain wise men living “in sacra dominica quae Palmarum dicitur,” and\r\nhaving taken counsel with them, he addressed the people: “Let us dig up\r\nthat pestilence and let us burn it with fire” (_effodiamus pestem illam et\r\ncomburamus igni_). Two young men were, accordingly, induced to set about\r\nthe task. They had not far to dig: “repente cadaver non multa humo egesta\r\nnudaverunt, enormi corpulentia distentum, facie rubenti turgentique supra\r\nmodum.”\r\n\r\nThe story, like others of the kind with a mixture of legend in them, is\r\nmore symbolical than real. The wise men of Annan may have been in error in\r\ntracing the plague of their village to a single corpse, but they were\r\nprobably on the right lines of causation. It is curious to observe in\r\nanother chronicler of the same period, Ralph of Coggeshall in Essex, and\r\nin a part of his chronicle which relates to the last years of Richard I.,\r\nand first years of John, a comment upon the action of Pope Innocent III.\r\n(about 1200 A.D.) in interdicting all Christian rites save baptism by the\r\nclergy in France: “O how horrible ... to refuse the Christian rite of\r\nburial to the bodies of the dead, so that they infected the air by their\r\nfoetor and struck horror into the souls of the living by their ghastly\r\nlooks[23].” The same pope’s interdict of decent burial and of other\r\nclerical rites extended to England in 1208, the famous Interdict of the\r\nreign of John. It was the papal method of checkmating the kingdoms of this\r\nworld; that it was subversive of traditional decency and immemorial\r\nsanitary precaution was a small matter beside the assertion of the\r\nauthority of Peter.\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, taught by experience or misled by fancy, the medieval\r\nworld firmly believed that the formal and elaborate disposal of the dead\r\nhad a sanitary aspect as well as a pious. The infection of the air, of\r\nwhich we shall hear much more in connexion with the plague, was a current\r\nnotion in England for several centuries before the Black Death. Especially\r\ndoes the dread of it find expression where corpses were unburied after a\r\nbattle, massacre, or calamity of nature. The exertions made in these\r\ncircumstances to bury the dead, even when all pious and domestic feeling\r\nwas hardened to the barest thought of self-preservation, are explained in\r\nset terms as instigated by the fear of breeding a pestilence. The instinct\r\nis as wide as human nature, and there is clear evidence in our own early\r\nwriters that its sanitary meaning was recognised. One such instance may be\r\nquoted from the St Albans annalist of the time of John and first years of\r\nHenry III.[24] In the year 1234, an unusually savage raid was made by the\r\nWelsh as far as Shrewsbury; they laid waste the country by fire and sword;\r\nwayfarers were horrified at the sight of naked and unburied corpses\r\nwithout number by the road sides, preyed on by ravenous beasts and birds;\r\nthe foetor of so much corruption infected the air on all sides, so that\r\neven the dead slew the living. The chronicler’s language, “quod etiam\r\nhomines sanos mortui peremerunt,” is marked by the perspicacity or\r\ncorrectness which distinguishes him. When the bubo-plague came to be\r\ndomesticated in English soil more than a century later, the disposal of\r\nthe dead became a sanitary question of obvious importance. But even in the\r\ncenturies before the Black Death, and most of all in the times when the\r\ntraditional practices of decent burial were interdicted by Popes or turned\r\nto mercenary purposes by clergy[25], we shall perhaps not err in looking\r\nfor one, at least, of the causes of localised outbreaks of pestilence in\r\nthe tainting of the soil and the air by the corruption of corpses\r\ninsufficiently buried and coffined.\r\n\r\nThere still remains, before we come to famine-sickness as the common type\r\nof pestilence in medieval England, to discover from the records any\r\nevidence of pestilence due to war and invasion. The domestic history from\r\nfirst to last is singularly free from such calamities. The whole history\r\nof Mohammedan conquest and occupation is a history of infection following\r\nin the train of war; and in Western Europe, at least from the invasion of\r\nItaly by Charles VIII., when the medieval period (according to Hallam)\r\ncloses, the sieges, battles, and campaigns are constantly associated with\r\nepidemic sickness among the people as well as among the troops. There is\r\nonly one period in the history of England, that of the civil wars of the\r\nParliament and the Royalists, in which the people had a real taste of the\r\ncommon continental experience. The civil wars of York and Lancaster, as we\r\nshall see, touched the common people little, and appear to have bred no\r\nepidemics.\r\n\r\nApart from civil war, there were invasions, by the Welsh and Scots on the\r\nwestern and northern marches, and by the Danes. One instance of pestilence\r\nfollowing a Welsh raid in the thirteenth century has been given from Roger\r\nof Wendover. A single instance is recorded in the history of the Danish\r\ninvasions. It has been preserved by several independent chroniclers, with\r\nsome variation in details; and it appears to have been distinguished by so\r\nmuch notice for the reason that it illustrates the magnanimity, sanctity,\r\nand miraculous power of St Elphege, archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1010 (or 1011 according to some), the Danes had stormed\r\nCanterbury, burnt the fair city, massacred the inhabitants, or carried\r\nthem captive to their ships at Sandwich. The archbishop Elphege was put\r\non board a small vessel and taken (doubtless by the inland channel which\r\nwas then open from the Stour to the Thames) to Greenwich, where he was\r\nimprisoned for seven months[26]. A council had assembled in London for the\r\npurpose of raising forty thousand pounds to buy off the invaders.\r\nAccording to the account used by Higden[27], Elphege refused to sanction\r\nthe payment of a ransom of three thousand pounds for his own person: he\r\nwas accordingly taken from prison, and on the 13th of the Calends of May,\r\n1010, was stoned to death by the Danes disappointed of his ransom.\r\nTherefore a pestilence fell upon the invaders, a _dolor viscerum_, which\r\ndestroyed them by tens and twenties so that a large number perished. The\r\nearlier narrative of William of Malmesbury[28] is diversified by the\r\nintroduction of a miracle, and is otherwise more circumstantial. While the\r\narchbishop was held in durance, a deadly sickness broke out among the\r\nDanes, affecting them in troops (_catervatim_), and proving so rapid in\r\nits effects that death ensued before they could feel pain. The stench of\r\ntheir unburied bodies so infected the air as to bring a plague upon those\r\nof them who had remained well. As the survivors were thrown into a panic,\r\n“sine numero, sine modo,” Elphege appeared upon the scene, and having\r\nadministered to them the consecrated bread, restored them to health and\r\nput an end to the plague.\r\n\r\nDisregarding what is fabulous, we may take these narratives to establish\r\nthe fact that a swift and fatal pestilence did break out among the Danes\r\nin Kent. It had consisted probably of the same forms of camp sickness,\r\nincluding dysentery (as the name _dolor viscerum_ implies), which have\r\noccurred in later times. It is the only instance of the kind recorded in\r\nthe early history.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedieval Famine-pestilences.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are all the instances of pestilence in early English\r\nhistory, unconnected with famine, that have been collected in a search\r\nthrough the most likely sources. The history of English epidemics,\r\nprevious to the Black Death, is almost wholly a history of famine\r\nsicknesses; and the list of such famines with attendant sickness, without\r\nmentioning the years of mere scarcity, is a considerable one.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF FAMINE-PESTILENCES IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  Year            Character                       Authority\r\n\r\n  679     Three years’ famine in Sussex    Beda, _Hist.

A history of epidemics is necessarily a morbid history. In\r\nthis chapter of it, we search out the lean years, saying nothing of the\r\nfat years; and by exclusively dwelling upon the dark side we may form an\r\nentirely wrong opinion of the comforts or hardships, prosperity or\r\nadversity, of these remote times. English writers of the earliest period,\r\nwhen they use generalities, are loud in praise of the advantages of their\r\nown island; until we come to the fourteenth century poem of ‘The Vision of\r\nPiers the Ploughman’ we should hardly suspect, from their usual strain,\r\nthat England was other than an earthly paradise, and every village an\r\nAuburn, “where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain.” There is a\r\npoem preserved in Higden’s _Polychronicon_ by one Henricus, who is almost\r\ncertainly Henry archdeacon of Huntingdon in the time of Henry I., although\r\nthe poem is not included among the archdeacon’s extant verse. The subject\r\nis ‘De Praerogativis Angliae,’ and the period, be it remarked, is one of\r\nthe early Norman reigns, when the heel of the conquering race is supposed\r\nto have been upon the neck of the English. Yet this poem contains the\r\nfamous boast of ‘Merry England,’ and much else that is the reverse of\r\nunhappy:--\r\n\r\n  “Anglia terra ferax et fertilis angulus orbis.\r\n   Anglia plena jocis, gens libera, digna jocari;\r\n   Libera gens, cui libera mens et libera lingua;\r\n   Sed lingua melior liberiorque manus.\r\n   Anglia terrarum decus et flos finitimarum,\r\n   Est contenta sui fertilitate boni.\r\n   Externas gentes consumptis rebus egentes,\r\n   Quando fames laedit, recreat et reficit.\r\n   Commoda terra satis mirandae fertilitatis\r\n   Prosperitate viget, cum bona pacis habet[29].”\r\n\r\nOr, to take another distich, apparently by Alfred of Beverley,\r\n\r\n  “Insula praedives, quae toto non eget orbe,\r\n   Et cujus totus indiget orbis ope.”\r\n\r\nOr, in Higden’s own fourteenth century words, after quoting these earlier\r\nestimates: “Prae ceteris gulae dedita, in victu et vestitu multum\r\nsumptuosa[30].”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there is a medieval proverbial saying which places\r\nEngland in a light strangely at variance with this native boast of\r\nfertility, plenty, and abundance overflowing to the famished peoples\r\nabroad: “Tres plagae tribus regionibus appropriari solent, Anglorum fames,\r\nGallorum ignis, Normannorum lepra”--three afflictions proper to three\r\ncountries, famine to England, St Anthony’s fire to France, leprosy to\r\nNormandy[31]. Whatever the “lepra Normannorum” may refer to, there is no\r\ndoubt that St Anthony’s fire, or ergotism from the use of bread containing\r\nthe grains of spurred rye, was a frequent scourge of some parts of France;\r\nand, in common repute abroad, famine seems to have been equally\r\ncharacteristic of England. Perhaps the explanation of England’s evil name\r\nfor famines is that there were three great English famines in the medieval\r\nhistory, before the Black Death, separated by generations, no doubt, but\r\nyet of such magnitude and attended by so disgraceful circumstances that\r\nthe rumour of them must have spread to foreign countries and made England\r\na by-word among the nations. These were the famines of 1194-96, 1257-59,\r\nand 1315-16. Of the first we have a tolerably full account by William of\r\nNewburgh, who saw it in Yorkshire; of the second we have many particulars\r\nand generalities by Matthew Paris of St Albans, who died towards the end\r\nof it; and of the third we have an account by one of his successors as\r\nhistoriographer at St Albans, John Trokelowe. All other references to\r\nfamine in England are meagre beside the narratives of these competent\r\nobservers, although there were probably two or three famines in the Norman\r\nperiod equally worthy of the historian’s pen. For the comprehension of\r\nEnglish famine-pestilences in general, we ought to take the best recorded\r\nfirst; but it will be on the whole more convenient to observe the\r\nchronological order, and to introduce, as occasion offers, some\r\ngeneralities on the types of disease which famine induced, the extent of\r\nthe mortalities, and the conditions of English agriculture and food-supply\r\nwhich made possible occasional famines of such magnitude.\r\n\r\nFrom the great plague “of Cadwallader’s time,” which corresponds in\r\nhistory to the foreign invasion of pestilence in 664, until nearly the end\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon rule, there is little recorded of famines and\r\nconsequent epidemic sickness. It does not follow that the period was one\r\nof plenty and prosperity for the people at large. The Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle is at no period detailed or circumstantial on the subject of\r\nfamines and pestilences; and although the entries become more numerous in\r\nthe last hundred years before the Chronicle came to an end in 1137, their\r\npaucity in the earlier period probably means no more than the imperfection\r\nof the record. Some of the generalities of Malthus might be applied to\r\nhelp the imagination over a period of history which we might otherwise be\r\ndisposed to view as the Golden Age. One of these, originally written for\r\nthe South Sea Islands, is applicable to all romantic pictures of “rude\r\nplenty,” such as the picture of the Anglo-Saxon household in _Ivanhoe_. It\r\nhas been remarked of Scott as a novelist that he always feeds everyone\r\nwell; but the picture, grateful to the imagination though it be, is\r\nprobably an illusion. “In a state of society,” says Malthus, “where the\r\nlives of the inferior order of the people seem to be considered by their\r\nsuperiors as of little or no value, it is evident that we are very liable\r\nto be deceived with regard to the appearances of abundance”; and again:\r\n“We may safely pronounce that among the shepherds of the North of Europe,\r\nwar and famine were the principal checks that kept the population down to\r\nthe level of their scanty means of subsistence.” The history of English\r\nagriculture is known with some degree of accuracy from the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and it is a history of prices becoming steadier and crops more\r\ncertain. It is not to be supposed that tillage was more advanced before\r\nthe Conquest than after it. On the other hand the probabilities are that\r\nEngland had steadily emerged from a pastoral state. It would be unfair to\r\njudge of the state of rural England at any time by the state of Wales in\r\nthe twelfth century, as it is described by Giraldus Cambrensis, or by the\r\ncondition of Ireland as described from the same traveller’s observations.\r\nBut in the absence of any concrete view of primitive England itself, the\r\npicture of the two neighbouring provinces may be introduced here.\r\n\r\nIreland, says Giraldus, closely following Beda, is a fertile land\r\nneglected; it had no agriculture, industries or arts; its inhabitants were\r\nrude and inhospitable, leading a purely pastoral life, and living more\r\nupon milk than upon meat. At the same time there was little sickness; the\r\nisland had little need of physicians; you will hardly ever find people ill\r\nunless they be at the extremity of death; between continuous good health\r\nand final dissolution there was no middle term. The excessive number of\r\nchildren born blind, or deaf, or deformed, he ascribes to incestuous\r\nunions and other sexual laxities[32].\r\n\r\nThe picture of Wales is that of a not less primitive society[33]. The\r\nWelsh do not congregate in towns, or in villages, or in fortified places,\r\nbut live solitary in the woods; they build no sumptuous houses of stone\r\nand lime, but only ozier booths, sufficient for the year, which they run\r\nup with little labour or cost. They have neither orchards nor gardens, and\r\nlittle else than pasture land. They partake of a sober meal in the\r\nevening, and if there should be little or nothing to eat at the close of\r\nday, they wait patiently until the next evening. They do not use\r\ntable-cloths nor towels; they are more natural than neat (_naturae magis\r\nstudent quam nitori_). They lie down to sleep in their day clothes, all in\r\none room, with a coarse covering drawn over them, their feet to the fire,\r\nlying close to keep each other warm, and when they are sore on one side\r\nfrom lying on the hard floor, they turn over to the other. There are no\r\nbeggars among this nation. It is of interest, from the point of view of\r\nthe “positive checks” of Malthus, to note that Giraldus more than hints at\r\nthe practice of a grosser form of immorality than he had charged the Irish\r\nwith. Spinning and weaving were of course not unknown, for the hard and\r\nrough blanket mentioned above was a native product. By the time that\r\nHigden wrote (about 1340), he has to record a considerable advance in the\r\ncivilization of Wales. Having used the description of Giraldus, he adds:\r\n“They now acquire property, apply themselves to agriculture, and live in\r\ntowns[34].” But in the reign of Henry II., it was found easy to bring the\r\nrebellious Welsh to terms by stopping the supplies of corn from England,\r\nupon which they were largely dependent[35].\r\n\r\nOf the condition of Scotland in the twelfth century we have no such sketch\r\nas Giraldus has left for Wales and Ireland. Uncivilized compared with\r\nEngland, the northern part of the island must certainly have been, if we\r\nmay trust the indignant references by Simeon of Durham and Henry of\r\nHuntingdon to the savage practices of the Scots who swarmed over the\r\nborder, with or without their king to lead them, or the remark by William\r\nof Malmesbury concerning the Scots who went on the Crusade leaving behind\r\nthem the insects of their native country.\r\n\r\nGiraldus intended to have written an itinerary or topography of England\r\nalso, but his purpose does not appear to have been fulfilled. Higden, his\r\nimmediate successor in that kind of writing a century and a half later, is\r\ncontent, in his section on England, to reproduce the generalities of\r\nearlier authors from Pliny downwards. Of these, we have already quoted the\r\n‘Prerogatives of England’ by Henry of Huntingdon, from which one might\r\ninfer that the British Isles, under the Norman yoke, were the Islands of\r\nthe Blest. On the other hand, the impression made by the details of the\r\nDomesday survey upon a historian of the soundest judgment, Hallam, is an\r\nimpression of poor cultivation and scanty sustenance. “There cannot be a\r\nmore striking proof,” he says, “of the low condition of English\r\nagriculture in the eleventh century than is exhibited in Domesday book.\r\nThough almost all England had been partially cultivated, and we find\r\nnearly the same manors, except in the north, which exist at present, yet\r\nthe value and extent of cultivated ground are inconceivably small. With\r\nevery allowance for the inaccuracies and partialities of those by whom\r\nthat famous survey was completed, we are lost in amazement at the constant\r\nrecurrence of two or three carucates in demesne, with folkland occupied by\r\nten or a dozen villeins, valued all together at forty shillings, as the\r\nreturn of a manor which now would yield a competent income to a\r\ngentleman[36].”\r\n\r\n    Whether, the population at the Domesday survey were nearer two\r\n    millions than one, the people were almost wholly on the land. Of the\r\n    size of the chief towns, as the Normans found them, we may form a not\r\n    incorrect estimate from the Domesday enumeration of houses held of the\r\n    king or of other superiors[37]. London, Winchester and Bristol do not\r\n    come at all into the survey. Besides these, the towns of the first\r\n    rank are Norwich, York, Lincoln, Thetford, Colchester, Ipswich,\r\n    Gloucester, Oxford, Cambridge, and Exeter.\r\n\r\n    Norwich had 1320 burgesses in the time of Edward the Confessor; in the\r\n    borough were 665 English burgesses rendering custom, and 480 bordarii\r\n    rendering none on account of their poverty; there were also more than\r\n    one hundred French households. Lincoln had 970 inhabited houses in\r\n    King Edward’s time, of which 200 were waste at the survey. Thetford\r\n    had 943 burgesses before the Conquest, and at the survey 720, with 224\r\n    houses vacant. York was so desolated just before the survey that it is\r\n    not easy to estimate its ordinary population; but it may be put at\r\n    about 1200 houses. Gloucester had 612 burgesses. Oxford seems to have\r\n    had about 800 houses; and for Cambridge we find an enumeration of the\r\n    houses in nine of the ten wards of the town in King Edward’s time, the\r\n    total being about 400. Colchester appears to have had some 700 houses,\r\n    Ipswich 538 burgesses, with 328 houses “waste” so far as tax was\r\n    concerned. Exeter had 300 king’s houses, and an uncertain number more.\r\n    Next in importance come such places as Southampton, Wallingford,\r\n    Northampton, Leicester, Warwick, Shrewsbury, Nottingham, Coventry,\r\n    Derby, Canterbury, Yarmouth, Rochester, Dover, Sandwich (about 400\r\n    houses), and Sudbury. In a third class may be placed towns like\r\n    Dorchester, Ilchester, Bridport, Wareham, Shaftesbury, Bath,\r\n    Chichester, Lewes, Guildford, Hythe, Romney, Pevensey, Windsor, Bath,\r\n    Chester, Worcester, Hereford, Huntingdon, Stamford, Grantham,\r\n    Hertford, St Albans, Torchesey, Maldon, each with from 100 to 200\r\n    burgesses. Dover and Sandwich each supplied twenty ships, with crews\r\n    of twenty-four men, for King Edward’s service during fifteen days of\r\n    the year. In Hereford there were six smiths, each rendering one penny\r\n    a year for his forge, and making 120 nails of the king’s iron. Many of\r\n    these houses were exceedingly small, with a frontage of seven feet;\r\n    the poorest class were mere sheds, built in the ditch against the\r\n    town wall, as at York and Canterbury.\r\n\r\nIt would be within the mark to say that less than one-tenth of the\r\npopulation of England was urban in any distinctive sense of the term.\r\nAfter London, Norwich, York, and Lincoln, there were probably no towns\r\nwith five thousand inhabitants. There were, of course, the simpler forms\r\nof industries, and there was a certain amount of commerce from the Thames,\r\nthe East Coast, and the Channel ports. The fertile soil of England\r\ndoubtless sustained abundance of fruit trees and produced corn to the\r\nmeasure of perhaps four or six times the seed. There were flocks of sheep,\r\nyielding more wool than the country used, herds of swine and of cattle.\r\nThe exports of wool, hides, iron, lead, and white metal gave occasion to\r\nthe importation of commodities and luxuries from Flanders, Normandy, and\r\nGascony. If there was “rude plenty” in England, it was for a sparse\r\npopulation, and it was dependent upon the clemency of the skies. A bad\r\nseason brought scarcity and murrain, and two bad seasons in succession\r\nbrought famine and pestilence.\r\n\r\nOf the general state of health we may form some idea from the Anglo-Saxon\r\nleechdoms, or collections of remedies, charms and divinations, supposed to\r\ndate from the eleventh century[38]. The maladies to which the English\r\npeople were liable in these early times correspond on the whole to the\r\neveryday diseases of our own age. There were then, as now, cancers and\r\nconsumptions, scrofula or “kernels,” the gout and the stone, the falling\r\nsickness and St Vitus’ dance, apoplexies and palsies, jaundice, dropsies\r\nand fluxes, quinsies and anginas, sore eyes and putrid mouth, carbuncles,\r\nboils and wildfire, agues, rheums and coughs. Maladies peculiar to women\r\noccupy a chief place, and there is evidence that hysteria, the outcome of\r\nhardships, entered largely into the forms of sickness, as it did in the\r\ntime of Sydenham. Among the curiosities of the nosology may be mentioned\r\nwrist-drop, doubtless from working in lead. One great chapter in disease,\r\nthe sickness and mortality of infants and children, is almost a complete\r\nblank. It ought doubtless to have been the greatest chapter of all. The\r\npopulation remained small, for one reason among others, that the children\r\nwould be difficult to rear. There is no direct evidence; but we may infer\r\nfrom analogous circumstances, that the inexpansive population meant an\r\nenormous infant mortality. The sounds which fell on the ear of Æneas as he\r\ncrossed the threshold of the nether world may be taken as prophetic, like\r\nso much else in Virgil, of the experience of the Middle Ages:\r\n\r\n  “Continuo auditae voces, vagitus et ingens\r\n   Infantumque animae flentes, in limine primo:\r\n   Quos dulcis vitae exsortes, et ab ubere raptos,\r\n   Abstulit atra dies, et funere mersit acerbo.”\r\n\r\nWe come, then, to the chronology of famine-pestilences, and first in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon period. The years from 664 to 685 are occupied, as we have\r\nseen, by a great plague, probably the bubo-plague, which returned in 1348\r\nas the Black Death, affecting, like the latter, the whole of England and\r\nIreland on its first appearance, and afterwards particular monasteries,\r\nsuch as Barking and Jarrow. But it is clear that famine-sickness was also\r\nan incident of the same years. The metrical romancist of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, Robert of Brunne, was probably mistaken in tracing the great\r\nplague of “Cadwaladre’s time” to famine in the first instance; there is no\r\nsuch suggestion in the authentic history of Beda. But that historian does\r\nmake a clear reference to famine in Sussex about the year 679[39].\r\nDescribing the conversion of Sussex to Christianity by Wilfrid, he says\r\nthat the province had been afflicted with famine owing to three seasons of\r\ndrought, that the people were dying of hunger, and that often forty or\r\nfifty together, “inedia macerati,” would proceed to the edge of the Sussex\r\ncliffs, and, joining hands, throw themselves into the sea. But on the very\r\nday when the people accepted the Christian baptism, there fell a\r\nplenteous rain, the earth flourished anew, and a glad and fruitful season\r\nensued[40].\r\n\r\nThe anarchy in Northumbria which followed the death of Beda (in 735), with\r\nthe decline of piety and learning in the northern monasteries, is said to\r\nhave led to famine and plague[41]. It is not until the year 793 that an\r\nentry of famine and mortality occurs in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It is\r\nin keeping with the disappointing nature of all these early records that\r\nSimeon of Durham and Roger of Howden, the two compilers who had access to\r\nlost records, are more particular in enumerating the portents that\r\npreceded the calamity than in describing its actual circumstances. Then a\r\nwhole century elapses (but for a vague entry under the year 822) until we\r\ncome to the three calamitous years, with 897 as the centre, which followed\r\nAlfred’s famous resistance to the Danes. In that mortality, many of the\r\nchief thanes died, and there was a murrain of cattle, with a scarcity of\r\nfood in Ireland. Two generations pass before the chronicle contains\r\nanother entry of the kind: in 962 there was a great mortality, and the\r\n“great fever” was in London. At no long intervals there are two more\r\nfamines, in 976 and 986. That of 986 (or 987) would appear to have been\r\nsevere; the church plate at Winchester was melted for the benefit of the\r\nstarving[42], and there was “a fever of men and a murrain of cattle[43].”\r\nAfter the expulsion of the Danes in 1005, says Henry of Huntingdon, there\r\nwas such desolation of famine as no one remembered. Then in 1010 or 1011\r\ncomes the incident of St Elphege, already given. From 1036 to 1049 we find\r\nmention of four, or perhaps five, famines, those of the years 1046 and\r\n1049 being marked by a great mortality of men and murrain of cattle.\r\n\r\nExcept in Yorkshire, the Norman Conquest had no immediate effects upon the\r\npeople of England in the way of famine and pestilence. From the last great\r\nmortality of 1049, a period of nearly forty years elapses until we come to\r\nthe great pestilence and sharp famine in the last year of the Conqueror’s\r\nreign (1086-7). The harrying of Yorkshire, however, is too important a\r\nlocal incident to be passed over in this history. Of these ruthless\r\nhorrors in the autumn of 1069 we have some particulars from the pen of\r\nSimeon of Durham, who has contemporary authority. There was such hunger,\r\nhe says, that men ate the flesh of their own kind, of horses, of dogs, and\r\nof cats. Others sold themselves into perpetual slavery in order that they\r\nmight be able to sustain their miserable lives on any terms (like the\r\nChinese in later times). Others setting out in exile from their country\r\nperished before their journey was ended. It was horrible to look into the\r\nhouses and farmyards, or by the wayside, and see the human corpses\r\ndissolved in corruption and crawling with worms. There was no one to bury\r\nthem, for all were gone, either in flight or dead by the sword and famine.\r\nThe country was one wide solitude, and remained so for nine years. Between\r\nYork and Durham no one dwelt, and travellers went in great fear of wild\r\nbeasts and of robbers[44]. William of Malmesbury says that the city of\r\nYork was so wasted by fire that an old inhabitant would not have\r\nrecognized it; and that the country was still waste for sixty miles at the\r\ntime of his writing (1125)[45]. In the Domesday survey we find that there\r\nwere 540 houses so waste that they paid nothing, 400 houses “not\r\ninhabited,” of which the better sort pay one penny and others less, and\r\nonly 50 inhabited houses paying full dues.\r\n\r\nThe same local chronicler who has left particulars of the devastation of\r\n1069-70, has given also a picture of the siege of Durham by Malcolm\r\nCanmore in 1091, which may serve to realize for us what a medieval siege\r\nwas, and what the Scots marches had to endure for intervals during several\r\ncenturies:--\r\n\r\n    Malcolm advancing drives the Northumbrians before him, some into the\r\n    woods and hills, others into the city of Durham; for there have they\r\n    always a sure refuge. Thither they drive their whole flocks and herds\r\n    and carry their furniture, so that there is hardly room within the\r\n    town for so great a crowd. Malcolm arrives and invests the city. It\r\n    was not easy for one to go outside, and the sheep and cattle could not\r\n    be driven to pasture: the churchyard was filled with them, and the\r\n    church itself was scarcely kept clear of them. Mixed with the cattle,\r\n    a crowd of women and children surrounded the church, so that the\r\n    voices of the choristers were drowned by the clamour. The heat of\r\n    summer adds to the miseries of famine. Every-where throughout the town\r\n    were the sounds of grief, ‘et plurima mortis imago,’ as in the sack of\r\n    Troy. The siege is raised by the miraculous intervention of St\r\n    Cuthbert[46].\r\n\r\nThe wasting of Yorkshire by William and the five incursions of the Scots\r\ninto Northumberland and Durham in the reign of Malcolm Canmore had the\r\neffect of reducing a large part of the soil of England to a comparatively\r\nunproductive state. The effacement of farms (and churches) in Hampshire,\r\nfor the planting of the New Forest, had the same effect in a minor degree.\r\nThe rigorous enforcement of the forest laws in the interests of the Norman\r\nnobles must have served also to remove one considerable source of the\r\nmeans of subsistence from the people. Whether these things, together with\r\nthe general oppression of the poor, contributed much or little to what\r\nfollowed, it is the fact that the long period from the last two years of\r\nWilliam to the welcomed advent of Henry II. to the throne in 1154, is\r\nfilled with a record of famines, pestilences, and other national\r\nmisfortunes such as no other period of English history shows.\r\n\r\nThe first general famine and pestilence under Norman rule was in the years\r\n1086 and 1087, the last of the Conqueror’s reign. It is probable from the\r\nentries in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that the aggravation (for which we\r\nmust always look in order to explain a historical famine and pestilence)\r\nwas due to two bad harvests in succession. The year 1086 was “heavy,\r\ntoilsome and sorrowful,” through failure of the corn and fruit crops owing\r\nto an inclement season, and through murrain of cattle[47]. Some form of\r\nsickness appears to have been prevalent between that harvest and the next.\r\nAlmost every other man, says the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, was stricken with\r\nfever, and that so sharply that many died of it. “Alas! how miserable and\r\nhow rueful a time was then! when the wretched men lay driven almost to\r\ndeath, and afterwards came the sharp famine and destroyed them quite.” It\r\nis probably a careless gloss upon that, by a historian of the next\r\ngeneration[48], when he says that “a promiscuous fever destroyed more than\r\nhalf the people,” and that famine, coming after, destroyed those whom the\r\nfever had spared[49]. But there can be no question that this was one of\r\nthose great periodic conjunctions of famine and fever (λιμὸν ὁμοῦ καὶ\r\nλοιμόν), of which we shall find fuller details in the chronicles of the\r\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It is easy to understand\r\nthat England, with all her wealth of fruits and corn in a good season, had\r\nno reserve for the poor at least, and sometimes not even for the rich, to\r\nget through two or more bad seasons with. How much the corn crop in those\r\ndays depended on the season is clear from the entry in the chronicle two\r\nyears after (1089), that reaping was still in progress at Martinmas (11\r\nNovember) and even later. Fields cultivated to yield an average of only\r\nfour or six times the seed were, of course, more at the mercy of the\r\nseasons than the highly cultivated corn-land of our own time.\r\n\r\nThe next famine with pestilence in England, seven years later, or in the\r\nseventh year of William Rufus, introduces us to a new set of\r\nconsiderations. It was the time when the exactions of tribute for the\r\nking’s wars in Normandy, or for the satisfaction of his greed and that of\r\nhis court, were severely felt both by the church and the people. England,\r\nsays one[50], was suffocated and unable to breathe. Both clergy and\r\nlaity, says another[51], were in such misery that they were weary of life.\r\nBut the most remarkable phraseology is that of William of Malmesbury, the\r\nchief historian of the period, who seldom descends from the region of high\r\npolitical and ecclesiastical affairs to take notice of such things as\r\nfamine and pestilence. In the 7th year of Rufus, he says, “agriculture\r\nfailed” on account of the tributes which the king had decreed from his\r\nposition in Normandy. The fields running to waste, a famine followed, and\r\nthat in turn was succeeded by a mortality so general that the dying were\r\nleft untended and the dead unburied[52]. The phrase about the lack of\r\ncultivation is a significant and not incredible statement, which places\r\nthe England of Rufus in the same light as certain belated feudal parts of\r\nIndia within recent memory.\r\n\r\n    In the villages of Gujerat, when the festival comes round early in\r\n    May, the chief of a village collects the cultivators and tells them\r\n    that it is time for them to commence work. They say: “No! the\r\n    assessment was too heavy last year, you lay too many taxes upon us.”\r\n    However, after much higgling, and presents made to the more important\r\n    men, a day is fixed for cultivation to begin, and the clearing and\r\n    manuring of the fields proceeds as before[53]. But while Gujerat was\r\n    still possessed by hundreds of petty feudal chiefs under the Mahratta\r\n    rule, previous to the establishment of the British Agency in 1821, the\r\n    exactions of tribute by the Baroda government were so extreme, and\r\n    enforced by so violent means[54], that cultivation was almost\r\n    neglected; the towns and villages swarmed with idlers, who subsisted\r\n    upon milk and ghee from their cows, while indolence and inactivity\r\n    affected the whole community[55]. A dreadful famine had “raged with\r\n    destructive fury” over Gujerat and Kattiwar for more than one year\r\n    about 1812-13-14, which was followed, not by a contagious fever, but\r\n    by the true bubo-plague.\r\n\r\nIf the English historian’s language, “agricultura defecit,” with\r\nreference to the tribute exacted by Rufus, have that fitness which we have\r\nreason to expect from him,--Higden varies it to “ita ut agricultura\r\ncessaret et fames succederet,”--then the famine and mortality about the\r\nyears 1094-5 were due to no less remarkable a cause than a refusal to\r\ncultivate the land. It is not to be supposed that the incubus of excessive\r\ntribute passed away with the accession of Henry I. The Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle repeats the complaint of heavy taxation in connexion with bad\r\nharvests and murrains in 1103, 1105 and 1110[56]. Severe winters, or\r\nautumn floods, with murrains and scarcity, are recorded also for the years\r\n1111, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1124 and 1125, the famine of 1125 having been\r\nattended with a mortality, and having been sufficiently great and general\r\nto be mentioned by several chroniclers[57]. In the midst of these years of\r\nscarcity and its effects upon the population, there occurs one singular\r\nentry of another kind in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, under the year 1112:\r\n“This was a very good year, and very abundant in wood and in field; but it\r\nwas a very sad and sorrowful one, through a most destructive\r\npestilence[58].” Under the year 1130, the annalist of the Welsh monastery\r\nof Margan, who is specially attentive to domestic events, records a\r\nmurrain of cattle all over England, which lasted several years so that\r\nscarcely one township escaped the pest, the pigsties becoming suddenly\r\nempty, and whole meadows swept of their cattle. It is to the same murrain\r\nthat the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle refers under the year 1131: in towns where\r\nthere had been ten or twelve ploughs going there was not one left, and the\r\nman who had 200 or 300 swine had not one left; after that died the\r\ndomestic fowls.\r\n\r\nThese things happened from time to time in the comparatively prosperous\r\nreign of Henry I. But with the death of Henry in 1135, there began a state\r\nof misery and lawlessness lasting almost to the accession of Henry II. in\r\n1154, beside which the former state of England was spoken of as “most\r\nflourishing[59].” Besides the barbarities of the Scots and the Welsh on\r\nthe northern and western marches[60], there were the civil wars of the\r\nfactions of King Stephen and the Empress Maud, and the cruelties and\r\npredations of the unruly nobles under the walls of a thousand newly-built\r\nstrongholds. A graphic account of the condition of England remains to us\r\nfrom the pen of an eyewitness, the observant author of the _Gesta\r\nStephani_[61]. Under the year 1143 he writes that there was most dire\r\nfamine in all England; the people ate the flesh of dogs and horses or the\r\nraw garbage of herbs and roots. The people in crowds pined and died, or\r\nanother part entered on a sorrowful exile with their whole families. One\r\nmight see houses of great name standing nearly empty, the residents of\r\neither sex and of every age being dead. As autumn drew near and the fields\r\nwhitened for the harvest, there was no one to reap them, for the\r\ncultivators were cut off by the pestilent hunger which had come between.\r\nTo these home troubles was added the presence of a multitude of barbarous\r\nadventurers, without bowels of pity and compassion, who had flocked to the\r\ncountry for military service. The occasion was one of those which cause\r\nthe archdeacon of Huntingdon to break out into his elegiac verse:\r\n\r\n  “Ecce Stygis facies, consimilisque lues[62].”\r\n\r\n“And in those days,” says another, “there was no king in Israel[63].” The\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle, which comes to an end in this scene of universal\r\ngloom, describes how one might go a day’s journey and never find a man\r\nsitting in a town, or the land tilled, and how men who once were rich had\r\nto go begging their bread, concluding with the words, “And they said\r\nopenly that Christ and His saints slept.”\r\n\r\nAmong the penances of Henry II. after the murder of Becket, there is\r\nrecorded his charity in feeding during a dearth ten thousand persons daily\r\nfrom the first of April, 1171, until the harvest[64]. But, apart from a\r\nreference to a flux among the troops in Ireland in 1172, from errors of\r\ndiet[65], the long reign of Henry II. is marked by only one record of\r\ngeneral pestilence. It is recorded by the best contemporary writer,\r\nBenedict of Peterborough, and it is the first instance in which the number\r\nof burials in a day (perhaps at Peterborough) is given. In the year 1175,\r\nhe says, there was in England and the adjacent regions a pestilential\r\nmortality of men, such that on many days seven or eight corpses were\r\ncarried out to be buried. And immediately upon that pestilential mortality\r\nthere followed a dire famine[66]. It is to be observed that the famine is\r\nexplicitly stated to have come after the pestilence, just as in the great\r\nmortality of 1087; and, as in the latter case, it may be that a hard\r\nwinter, with scarcity of food, brought a general sickness, and that the\r\nscarcity had been raised to famine point by a second bad harvest. The\r\nentry in the chronicle of Melrose for 1173 may refer to Scotland only: a\r\nbad kind of cough, unheard of before, affected almost everyone far and\r\nwide, whereof, “or from which pest,” many died. This is perhaps the only\r\nspecial reference to “tussis” as epidemic until the influenzas of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe comparative freedom of the long reign of Henry II. from famines and\r\nnational distress probably arose as much from good government as from the\r\nclemency of the seasons. The country was growing rich by foreign trade. In\r\n1190 the two leading Jews of York, Joyce and Benedict, were occupying\r\nresidences in the heart of the town like royal palaces in size and in the\r\nsumptuousness of their furniture. The same historian, William of\r\nNewburgh, who records the king’s protection of these envied capitalists,\r\nmentions also his protection of “the poor, the widows and the orphans,”\r\nand his liberal charities. That the king’s protection of his poorer\r\nsubjects was not unneeded, would be obvious if we could trust the\r\nextraordinary account of the keen traders of London which is put by\r\nRichard of Devizes into the mouth of a hostile witness[67]. The peoples of\r\nall nations, it appears, flocked to London, each nationality contributing\r\nto the morals of the capital its proper vices and manners. There was no\r\nrighteous person in London, no, not one; there were more thieves in London\r\nthan in all France[68]. In the entirely different account, of the same\r\ndate, by an enthusiastic Londoner, the monk Fitz-Stephen, the only\r\n“plagues” of London are said to be “the immoderate drinking of fools and\r\nthe frequency of fires.” The city and suburbs had one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six small parish churches, besides thirteen greater conventual\r\nchurches; and it was a model to all the world for religious observances.\r\n“Nearly all the bishops, abbots, and magnates of England are, as it were,\r\ncitizens and freemen of London; having there their own splendid houses, to\r\nwhich they resort, where they spend largely when summoned to great\r\ncouncils by the king or by their metropolitan, or drawn thither by their\r\nown private affairs[69].” The archdeacon of London, of the same date,\r\nPeter of Blois, in a letter to the pope, Innocent III., concerning the\r\nextent of his duties and the smallness of his stipend, gives the parish\r\nchurches in the city at one hundred and twenty, and the population at\r\nforty thousand[70]. The Germans who came in the train of Richard I. on\r\nhis return to England in 1194, after his release from the hands of the\r\nemperor, were amazed at the display of wealth and finery which the\r\nLondoners made to welcome back the king; if the emperor had known the\r\nriches of England, they said, he would have demanded a heavier ransom[71].\r\nThe ransom, all the same, required a second, or even a third levy before\r\nit was raised, owing, it was said, to peculation; and the ecclesiastics,\r\nwho held a large part of the soil, appear to have had so little in hand to\r\npay their share that they had to pledge the gold and silver vessels of the\r\naltar[72].\r\n\r\nThe year of Richard’s accession, 1189, is given by the annalist of the\r\nWelsh monastery of Margan, as a year of severe famine and of a mortality\r\nof men. Probably it was a local famine, and it may well have been the same\r\nin which Giraldus Cambrensis says that he himself saw crowds of poor\r\npeople coming day after day to the gates of the monastery of Margan, so\r\nthat the brethren took counsel and sent a ship to Bristol for corn[73].\r\nThe great and general famine with pestilence in Richard’s time was in the\r\nyears 1193, 1194, 1195, 1196 and 1197, and it appears to have been felt in\r\nFrance, in the basin of the Danube, and over all Europe, as well as in\r\nEngland. Of the pestilence which came with it in England we have an\r\nexceptionally full account from the pen of William of Newburgh. The\r\nmonastery in which William wrote his history was situated among woods by\r\nthe side of a stream under the Hambledon hills in Yorkshire, on the road\r\nbetween York and the mouth of the Tees; so that when he says of this\r\nfamine and pestilence, “we speak what we do know, and testify what we have\r\nseen,” he may be taken as recording the experience of a sufficiently\r\ntypical region of rural England.\r\n\r\nHis narrative of the pestilence[74] is given under the year 1196, which\r\nwas the fourth year of the scarcity or famine: After the crowds of poor\r\nhad been dying on all sides of want, a most savage plague ensued, as if\r\nfrom air corrupted by dead bodies of the poor. This pestilence showed but\r\nlittle respect even for those who had abundance of food; and as to those\r\nwho were in want, it put an end to their long agony of hunger. The disease\r\ncrept about everywhere, always of one type, namely that of an acute fever.\r\nDay after day it seized so many, and finished so many more, so that there\r\nwere scarcely to be found any to give heed to the sick or to bury the\r\ndead. The usual rites of burial were omitted, except in the case of some\r\nnobler or richer person; at whatever hour anyone died the body was\r\nforthwith committed to the earth, and in many places great trenches were\r\nmade if the number of corpses was too great to afford time for burying\r\nthem one by one. And as so many were dying every day, even those who were\r\nin health fell into low spirits, and went about with pale faces,\r\nthemselves the living picture of death. In the monasteries alone was this\r\npestilence comparatively unfelt. After it had raged on all sides for five\r\nor six months, it subsided when the winter cold came.\r\n\r\nThose lean years were doubtless followed by seven fat years; for it is not\r\nuntil 1203, the fourth year of John, that we again meet with the records\r\nof famine and pestilence. From various monasteries, from Waverley in\r\nSussex, Tewkesbury in Gloucester and Margan in Glamorgan, we have the same\r\ntestimony--“fames magna et mortalitas,” “fames valida, et saeva mortalitas\r\nmultitudinem pauperum extinguit,” “maxima fames.” The monks of Waverley\r\nhad to leave their own house and disperse themselves through various\r\nmonasteries. Two years after, 1205, there came so hard a season that the\r\nwinter-sown seed was almost killed by frost. The Thames was crossed on the\r\nice, and there was no ploughing for many weeks. An Essex annalist says\r\nthere was a famine, and quotes the famine prices: a quarter of wheat was\r\nsold for a pound in many parts of England, although in Henry II.’s time it\r\nwas often as low as twelve pence; a quarter of beans ten shillings; a\r\nquarter of oats forty pence, which used to be four pence[75]. The annalist\r\nat Margan enters also the year 1210 as a sickly one throughout\r\nEngland[76].\r\n\r\nWe are now come to the period when we can read the succession of these\r\nevents in the domestic life of the people from the more trustworthy\r\nrecords of the St Albans school of historians. Of the scarcity and\r\nsickness among the poor in 1234 we have some suggestive particulars by\r\nRoger of Wendover[77], and for the series of famines and epidemics from\r\n1257 to 1259 we have a comparatively full account by his famous successor\r\nin the office of historiographer to the abbey, Matthew Paris[78]. The next\r\nSt Albans _scriptorius_, Rishanger[79], notes the kind of harvest every\r\nyear from 1259 to 1305, and for only one of those years after the scarcity\r\nof 1259 was past, namely the year 1294, does he speak of the people dying\r\nof hunger. His successor, John Trokelowe[80], carries on the annals to\r\n1323, and gives us some particulars, not without diagnostic value, of the\r\ngreat famine-sickness of 1315-16, and of the succession of dear years of\r\nwhich the epidemic was an incident. It is on these contemporary accounts\r\nby the St Albans school, together with the record for the year 1196 by\r\nWilliam of Newburgh, that our knowledge of the famine-pestilences of\r\nEngland must be based.\r\n\r\nWith the harvest of 1259 begins the tabulation of agricultural prices from\r\nfarm-bailiffs’ accounts, by Professor Thorold Rogers, a work of vast\r\nlabour in which the economic history of the English people is written in\r\nindubitable characters, and by means of which we are enabled to check the\r\nmore general and often rhetorical statements of the contemporary\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nAlthough the history of the last year or two of John and of the earlier\r\nyears of Henry III. is full of turbulence and rapine, yet we hear of no\r\ngeneral distress among the cultivators of the soil. The contemporary\r\nauthority, Roger of Wendover, has no entry of the kind until 1234,\r\nexcepting a single note under the year 1222, that wheat rose to twelve\r\nshillings the quarter. We hear of king John and his following as\r\nplundering the rich churchmen and laymen all the way from St Albans to\r\nNottingham, of William Longspée, earl of Salisbury, carrying on the same\r\npractices in the counties of Essex, Middlesex, Hertford, Cambridge and\r\nHuntingdon, of the spoliation of the Isle of Ely, and of the occupation of\r\ntowns and villages in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk by Louis, Dauphin of\r\nFrance, the king-elect, or broken reed, on whom the Barons of Magna Charta\r\nthought for a time to lean[81]. But the whole of that period, and of the\r\nyears following until 1234, is absolutely free from any record of\r\nwide-spread distress among the lower class. We are reminded of the\r\nobservation by Philip de Comines, with the civil wars of York and\r\nLancaster in his mind, a saying which is doubtless true of all the\r\nstruggles in England for the settlement of the respective claims of king\r\nand aristocracy: “England has this peculiar grace,” says the French\r\nstatesman, “that neither the country, nor the people, nor the houses are\r\nwasted or demolished; but the calamities and misfortunes of the war fall\r\nonly upon the soldiers and especially the nobility, of whom they are more\r\nthan ordinarily jealous: for nothing is perfect in this world.” That\r\ncannot apply of course to the barbarous incursions of the Scots and the\r\nWelsh; for the northern marches were often reduced to desolation during a\r\nperiod of three hundred years after the Conquest and were never more\r\ndesolate than in the reign of Richard II.; while the marches of Wales were\r\nsubject to not less ruthless spoliations until the concessions to the\r\nWelsh by Edward I. Nor is the immunity of the peasantry from the troubles\r\nof civil war to be taken as absolute; for we find under the year 1264,\r\nwhen Simon de Montfort was in the field against the king, an explicit\r\nstatement that the small peasantry were plundered even to the poor\r\nfurniture of their cottages. But on the whole we may take it that the\r\nparalysing effect of civil war seldom reached to the English lower classes\r\nin the medieval period, that the tenour of their lives was seldom\r\ndisturbed except by famine or plague, and that kings and nobles were left\r\nto fight it out among themselves.\r\n\r\nWe become aware, however, from the time of the Great Charter, and during\r\nthe steady growth of the country’s prosperity, of a widening chasm between\r\nthe rich and the poor within the ranks of the commons themselves, and that\r\ntoo, not only in the centres of trade (as we shall see), but also in\r\ncountry districts. The claims of feudal service did not prevent some among\r\nthe villagers from adding house to house, and field to field, thereby\r\nmarking in every parish the interval between the thriving and comfortable\r\nand a residuum of _pauperes_ composed of the less capable or the less\r\nfortunate. A curious story, told by Roger of Wendover of the village of\r\nAbbotsley near St Neots, will serve as an illustration of a fact which we\r\nmight be otherwise well assured of from first principles[82].\r\n\r\nThe year 1234 was the third of a succession of lean years. So sharp was\r\nthe famine before the harvest of that year, that crowds of the poor went\r\nto the fields in the month of July, and plucked the unripe ears of corn,\r\nrubbing them in their hands and eating the raw grain. The St Albans monk\r\nis full of indignation against the prevailing spirit of avarice which\r\nreduced some of the people to that sad necessity: Alms had everywhere gone\r\nout of fashion; the rich, abounding in all manner of temporal goods, were\r\nso smitten with blind greed that they suffered Christian men, made in the\r\nimage of God, to die for want of food. Some, indeed, were so impious as to\r\nsay that their wealth was due to their own industry, and not to the gift\r\nof God. Of that mind seem to have been the more prosperous cultivators of\r\nthe village of Abbotsley “who looked on the needy with an eye of\r\nsuspicion[83].”\r\n\r\n    The following story is told of them. Seeing the poor making free with\r\n    their corn in the ear, they assembled in the parish church on a Sunday\r\n    in August, and assailed the parson with their clamours, demanding that\r\n    he would forthwith pronounce the ban of the Church upon those who\r\n    helped themselves to the ears of corn. The parson, notwithstanding a\r\n    well-known precedent in the Gospels, was about to yield to their\r\n    insistence, when a man of religion and piety rose in the congregation\r\n    and adjured the priest, in the name of God and all His saints, to\r\n    refrain from the sentence, adding that those who were in need were\r\n    welcome to help themselves to his own corn. The others, however,\r\n    insisted, and the parson was just beginning to ban the pilferers, when\r\n    a thunderstorm suddenly burst, with hail and torrents of rain. When\r\n    the storm had passed, the peasants went out to find their crops\r\n    destroyed,--all but that one simple and just man who found his corn\r\n    untouched.\r\n\r\nWe have only to recall the minute subdivisions of the common field, or\r\nfields, of the parish into half-acre strips separated by balks of turf,\r\nand the fact that no two half-acres of the same cultivator lay together,\r\nto realize how nice must have been the discrimination[84].\r\n\r\nBut the moral of the story is obvious. It is an appeal to the teaching and\r\nthe sanction of the Gospels, against the rooted belief of the natural man\r\nthat he owes what he has to his own industry and thrift, and that it is no\r\nbusiness of his to part with his goods for the sustenance of a helpless\r\nand improvident class.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of avarice, according to Wendover, permeated all classes at\r\nthis period, from high ecclesiastics downwards. Walter, archbishop of\r\nYork, had his granaries full of corn during the scarcity, some of it five\r\nyears old. When the peasants on his manors asked to be supplied from these\r\nstores in the summer of 1234, the archbishop instructed his bailiffs to\r\ngive out the old corn on condition of getting new for it when the harvest\r\nwas over. It need not be told at length how the archbishop’s barns at\r\nRipon were found on examination to be infested with vermin, how the corn\r\nhad turned mouldy and rotten, and how the whole of it had to be destroyed\r\nby fire[85]. Of the same import are the raids upon the barns of the alien\r\nor Italian clergy in 1228, in the diocese of Winchester and elsewhere, and\r\nthe ostentatious distribution by the raiders of doles to the poor[86].\r\n\r\nThe somewhat parallel course of public morality in the centres of trade,\r\nor, as Wendover would call it, the prevalence of avarice, demands a brief\r\nnotice for our purpose.\r\n\r\nIn every state of society, there will of course be rich and poor. But a\r\nclass of _pauperes_ seems to emerge more distinctly in the life of England\r\nfrom about the beginning of the thirteenth century. The period corresponds\r\nto the appearance on the scene of St Francis and his friars. Doubtless St\r\nFrancis was inspired by a true sense of what the time needed, even if it\r\nbe open to contend that his ministrations of charity brought out,\r\nconsolidated, and kept alive a helpless class who would have been less\r\nheard of if they had been left to the tender mercies of economic\r\nprinciples. The mission of the friars was not merely to the poor; it was\r\nalso to the rich, whether of the church or of the world, “to soften the\r\nhardness of their hearts by the oil of preaching[87].” It was one of these\r\ninterpositions, ever needed and never wanting, to reduce the inequalities\r\nof the human lot, not by preaching down-right theoretical communism, but,\r\nmore by force of rhetoric than of logic, to extort from the strong some\r\nconcessions to the weak, to mitigate the severity of the struggle for\r\nexistence, and to bring the respectable vices of greed and sharp practice\r\nto the bar of conscience.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1196 there is the significant incident, in the city of London,\r\nof the rising of the poorer class and the middling class, headed by\r\nFitzosbert Longbeard, himself one of the privileged citizens, against an\r\nassessment in which the class represented by the mayor and aldermen were\r\nalleged to have been very tender of their own interests[88]. Longbeard was\r\nhailed as “the friend of the poor,” and, having lost his life in their\r\ncause (whether in the street before Bow Church, or on a gallows at Tyburn,\r\nor at the Smithfield elms, the narratives are not agreed), he is\r\ncelebrated by the sympathetic Matthew Paris as “the martyr of the\r\npoor[89].” That historian continues, after the manner of his predecessor\r\nWendover, to speak of Londoners as on the one hand the “mediocres,\r\npopulares et plebei,” and on the other hand the “divites.” In 1258 the\r\nlatter class overreached themselves: they were caught in actual vulgar\r\npeculation of money raised by assessment for repairing the city walls;\r\nsome of them were thrown into prison and only escaped death through the\r\nroyal clemency at the instance of the notorious pluralist John Mansel, and\r\non making restitution of their plunder; but one of them, the mayor, never\r\nrecovered the blow to his respectability, and died soon after of\r\ngrief[90]. Whether it meant a wide-spread spirit of petty fraud, or some\r\nunadjusted change in value, the young king in 1228, during a journey from\r\nYork to London, took occasion along his route to destroy the “false\r\nmeasures” of corn, ale and wine, to substitute more ample measures, and to\r\nincrease the weight of the loaf.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity or famine of 1234, to which the Abbotsley incident belongs,\r\nwas accompanied, says the St Albans annalist, by a mortality which raged\r\ncruelly everywhere. On the other hand the annalist of Tewkesbury may be\r\ncredited when he says that, although the year was one of scarcity, corn\r\nbeing at eight shillings, yet “by the grace of God the poor were better\r\nsustained than in other years[91].”\r\n\r\nThere was an epidemic in 1247, but it is not clear whether it was due to\r\nfamine. Although Higden, quoting from some unknown record, says that there\r\nwas dearth in England in that year, wheat being at twelve shillings the\r\nquarter, yet he does not mention sickness at all; and Matthew Paris, who\r\nwas then living, is explicit that the harvest of 1247 was an abundant one,\r\nand that the mortality did not begin until September of that year. There\r\ndoes appear, however, to have been a sharp famine in Wales; and it is\r\nrecorded that the bishop of Norwich, “about the year 1245,” in a time of\r\ngreat dearth, sold all his plate and distributed it to the poor[92]. All\r\nthat we know of this epidemic is the statement of Matthew Paris, that it\r\nbegan in September and lasted for three months; and that as many as nine\r\nor ten bodies were buried in one day in the single churchyard of St\r\nPeter’s at Saint Albans[93].\r\n\r\nMatthew Paris notes the quality of the harvest and the prices of grain\r\nevery year, and his successor Rishanger continues the practice. The prices\r\nnoted appear, from comparison with those tabulated by Thorold Rogers from\r\nactual accounts, to have been the lowest market rates of the year. The\r\nharvest of 1248 was plentiful, and wheat sold at two shillings and\r\nsixpence a quarter. In 1249 and 1250 it was at two shillings, oats being\r\nat one shilling. But those years of exceptional abundance were followed at\r\nno long interval by a series of years of scarcity or famine, which brought\r\npestilential sickness of the severest kind.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity or famine in the years 1256-59 was all the more acutely felt\r\nowing to the dearth of money in the country. The burden of the history of\r\nMatthew Paris before he comes to the famine is that England had been\r\nemptied of treasure by the exactions of king and pope. Henry III. was\r\nunder some not quite intelligible obligation of money to his brother, the\r\nearl of Cornwall. The English earl was a candidate for the Imperial crown,\r\nand had got so far towards the dignity of emperor as to have been made\r\nking of the Germans. It was English money that went to pay his German\r\ntroops, and to further his cause with the electoral princes; but the\r\ncirculating coin of England does not appear to have sufficed for these and\r\ndomestic purposes also. The harvest of 1256 had been spoiled by wet, and\r\nthe weather of the spring of 1257 was wretched in the extreme. All England\r\nwas in a state of marsh and mud, and the roads were impassable. Many sowed\r\ntheir fields over again; but the autumn proved as wet as the rest of the\r\nyear. “Whatever had been sown in winter, whatever had germinated in\r\nspring, whatever the summer had brought forward--all was drowned in the\r\nfloods of autumn.” The want of coins in circulation caused unheard-of\r\npoverty. At the end of the year the fields lay untilled, and a multitude\r\nof people were dead of famine. At Christmas wheat rose to ten shillings a\r\nquarter. But the year 1257 appears to have had “lethal fevers” before the\r\nloss of the harvest of that year could be felt. Not to mention other\r\nplaces, says the St Albans historian, there was at St Edmundsbury in the\r\ndog-days so great a mortality that more than two thousand bodies were\r\nburied in its spacious cemetery[94].\r\n\r\nThe full effects of the famine were not felt until the spring of 1258. So\r\ngreat was the pinch in London from the failure of the crops and the want\r\nof money that fifteen thousand[95] are said to have died of famine, and of\r\na grievous and wide-spread pestilence that broke out about the feast of\r\nthe Trinity (19 May).\r\n\r\nThe earl of Cornwall (and king of Germany) who had relieved the country of\r\na great part of its circulating coin, took the opportunity to buy up corn\r\nin Germany and Holland for the supply of the London market. Fifty great\r\nships, says Matthew Paris, arrived in the Thames laden with wheat, barley,\r\nand other grain. Not three English counties had produced as much as was\r\nimported. The corn was for such as could buy it; but the king interposed\r\nwith an edict that, whereas greed was to be discouraged, no one was to buy\r\nthe foreign corn in order to store it up and trade in it. Those who had no\r\nmoney, we are expressly told, died of hunger, even after the arrival of\r\nthe ships; and even men of good position went about with faces pinched by\r\nhunger, and passed sleepless nights sighing for bread. No one had seen\r\nsuch famine and misery, although many would have remembered corn at higher\r\nprices. The price quoted about this stage of the narrative, although not\r\nwith special reference to the foreign wheat, is nine shillings the\r\nquarter. Elsewhere the price is said to have mounted up to fifteen\r\nshillings, which may have been the rate before the foreign supply came in.\r\nBut such was the scarceness of money, we are told, that if the price of\r\nthe quarter of wheat had been less, there would hardly have been found\r\nanyone to buy it. Even those who were wont to succour the miserable were\r\nnow reduced to perish along with them. It is difficult to believe that the\r\nhistorian has not given way to the temptations of rhetoric, and it is\r\npleasing to be able to give the following complement to his picture. After\r\nsome 15,000 had died in London, mostly of the poorer sort, one might hear\r\na crier making proclamation to the starving multitude to go to a\r\ndistribution of bread by this or that nobleman, at such and such a place,\r\nmentioning the name of the benefactor and the place of dole.\r\n\r\nIn other passages, which may be taken as picturing the state of matters in\r\nthe country, the historian says that the bodies of the starved were found\r\nswollen and livid, lying five or six together in pig-sties, or on\r\ndungheaps, or in the mud of farmyards. The dying were refused shelter and\r\nsuccour for fear of contagion, and scarcely anyone would go near the dead\r\nto bury them. Where many corpses were found together, they were buried in\r\ncapacious trenches in the churchyards.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the harvest of 1258. After a bleak and late spring the\r\ncrops had come forward well under excessive heat in summer, and the\r\nharvest was an unusually abundant, although a late one. Rains set in\r\nbefore the corn could be cut, and at the feast of All Saints (1 November)\r\nthe heavy crops had rotted until the fields were like so many dungheaps.\r\nOnly in some places was any attempt made to carry the harvest home, and\r\nthen it was so spoiled as to be hardly worth the trouble. Even the mouldy\r\ngrain sold as high as sixteen shillings a quarter. The famishing people\r\nresorted to various shifts, selling their cattle and reducing their\r\nhouseholds. How the country got through the winter, we are not told.\r\nMatthew Paris himself died early in 1259, and the annalist who added a few\r\npages to the _Chronica Majora_ after his death, merely mentions that the\r\ncorn, the oil and the wine turned corrupt, and that as the sun entered\r\nCancer a pestilence and mortality of men began unexpectedly, in which many\r\ndied. Among others Fulk, the bishop of London, died of pestilence in the\r\nspring of 1259; and, to say nothing of many other places, at Paris\r\n----thousand (the number is left blank) were buried.\r\n\r\nThe vagueness of the last statement reminds us that we are now deprived of\r\nthe comparatively safe guidance of Matthew Paris. His successor in the\r\noffice of annalist at St Albans, Rishanger, is much less trustworthy. He\r\nsums up the year 1259 in a paragraph which repeats exactly the facts of\r\nthe notorious year 1258, and probably applies to that alone; for the year\r\n1260 his summary is that it was more severe, more cruel and more terrible\r\nto all living things than the year before, the pestilence and famine being\r\nintolerable. There is, however, no confirmation of that in the authentic\r\nprices of the year collected by Thorold Rogers. Parcels of wheat of the\r\nharvest of 1259 were sold at about five and six shillings, and of the\r\nharvest of 1260 at from three shillings and sixpence to six shillings. For\r\na number of years, corresponding to the Barons’ war and the war in Wales,\r\nthe price is moderate or low, the figures of extant bailiffs’ accounts\r\nagreeing on the whole with Rishanger’s summary statements about the\r\nrespective harvests[96]. The years from 1271 to 1273 were dear years, and\r\nfor the first of the series we find a doubtful record by the Yorkshire\r\ncontinuator of William of Newburgh that there was “a great famine and\r\npestilence in England and Ireland[97].” The harvest of 1288 was so\r\nabundant that the price of wheat in the bailiffs’ accounts is mostly about\r\ntwo shillings, ranging from sixteen pence to four and eightpence.\r\nRishanger’s prices for the year are sufficiently near the mark: in some\r\nplaces wheat sold at twenty pence the quarter, in others at sixteen pence,\r\nand in others at twelve pence. From that extremely low point, a rise\r\nbegins which culminates in 1294. The chronicler’s statement for 1289, that\r\nin London the bushel of wheat rose from threepence to two shillings, is\r\nnot borne out by the bailiffs’ accounts, which show a range of from two\r\nshillings and eightpence to six shillings the quarter. But these accounts\r\nconfirm the statement that the years following were dear years, and that\r\n1294 was a year of famine prices, wheat having touched fourteen shillings\r\nat Cambridge, in July. Rishanger’s two notes are that the poor perished of\r\nhunger, and that the poor died of hunger on all sides, afflicted with a\r\nlooseness (_lienteria_)[98]. The two years following are also given as\r\nhard for the poor, but not as years of famine or sickness; the country was\r\nat the same time heavily taxed for the expenses of the war which Edward I.\r\nwas waging against the Scots. Ordinary prosperity attends the cultivators\r\nof the soil until the end of Rishanger’s chronicle in 1305; and from the\r\nbeginning of Trokelowe’s in 1307, the year of Edward II.’s accession,\r\nthere is nothing for our purpose until we come to the great famine of\r\n1315[99].\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that prices were high in every year from 1309 until\r\nthat famine, with the single exception of the harvest of 1311. At the\r\nmeeting of Parliament in London before Easter in 1315, the dearth was a\r\nsubject of deliberation, and a King’s writ was issued attempting to fix\r\nthe prices at which fat oxen, cows, sheep, pigs, geese, fowls, capons,\r\nchickens, pigeons and eggs should be sold on demand, subject to\r\nconfiscation if the sale were refused. The statute was ineffective (it was\r\nrepealed the year after), and provisions became dearer than ever. The\r\nquarter of wheat, beans and peas sold for twenty shillings, of oats for\r\nten shillings, and of salt for thirty-five. When the king stopped at St\r\nAlbans at the feast of St Lawrence, says Trokelowe, it was hardly possible\r\nto buy bread for the use of his household. The scarcity was most felt from\r\nthe month of May until the harvest. With the new crop, ruined as it was by\r\nrains and floods, the scarcity lessened somewhat, but not before many had\r\nfelt the pinch of hunger, and others were seen (as the St Albans annalist\r\nsays he saw them) lying squalid and dead in the villages and by the\r\nroad-sides. At Midsummer, 1316, wheat rose to thirty shillings, and after\r\nthat as high as forty shillings (the highest price found by Thorold Rogers\r\nis twenty-six shillings and eightpence at Leatherhead in July). The\r\nvarious forms of famine-sickness are mentioned:--dysentery from corrupt\r\nfood, affecting nearly everyone, an acute fever which killed many, or a\r\nputrid sore throat (_pestis gutturuosa_). To show the extremities to which\r\nEngland was reduced, Trokelowe specially inserts the following: Ordinary\r\nflesh was not to be had, but horse-flesh was eaten, fat dogs were stolen\r\nto eat, and it was rumoured abroad that in many places both men and women\r\nsecretly ate the flesh of their own children, or of the children of\r\nothers. But the detail which Trokelowe justly thinks posterity will be\r\nmost horrified to read, is that prisoners in gaols set upon the thieves\r\nnewly brought in and devoured them alive.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the same famine and pestilence that we find worked into the\r\nmetrical romance of Robert of Brunne (1338), under the guise of the plague\r\n‘in Cadwaladre’s time,’ that is, the pestilence recorded by Beda for the\r\nyear 664. The Lincolnshire romancist must have seen the famine and\r\npestilence of 1315-16, for he was then in the prime of life, and probably\r\nhe transferred his own experiences of famine and pestilence to the remote\r\nepisode of the seventh century, to which he devotes thirty-eight lines of\r\nhis romance. In Cadwaladre’s time the corn fails and there is great\r\nhunger. A man may go for three days before he can buy any food in burgh,\r\nor in city, or in upland; he may indeed catch wild creatures, or fishes,\r\nor gather leaves and roots. Worse still, a plague comes, from rotten air\r\nand wicked winds, so that hale men fall down suddenly and die; gentle and\r\nbondmen all go, hardly any are left to till the land, the living cannot\r\nbury the dead, those who try fall dead in the grave. Men leave house and\r\nland, and few are left in the country. Eleven years does Britain lie waste\r\nwith but few folk to till the land[100].\r\n\r\nAfter the famine of 1315-16, the third and last of the great and, one may\r\nsay, disgraceful famines which gave rise to the by-word “Anglorum fames,”\r\nprices continued at their ordinary level for several years. But from 1320\r\nto 1323 they again came to a height. To that period probably belongs a\r\nmortality which is entered, in a chronicle of the next century[101], under\r\nthe year 1325. On the contemporary authority of Higden we know that, in\r\n1322, the king went to Scotland about the feast of St Peter ad Vincula,\r\n“and though he met not with resistance, lost many of his own by famine and\r\ndisease.” After that period of scarcity comes a long succession of cheap\r\nyears, covering the interval to the next great event in the annals of\r\npestilence that concerns us, the arrival of the Black Death in the autumn\r\nof 1348. With that great event the history of English epidemics enters\r\nupon a new chapter. There were, of course, years of dearth and scarcity in\r\nthe centuries following, but there were no great famine-pestilences like\r\nthose of 1196, 1258 and 1315.\r\n\r\nThe period of the great famines ought not to be left without another\r\nreference to the widening gulf between the rich and the poor, and the\r\nkeenness of traders which led them sometimes to incur the restraints of\r\ngovernment and the punishments of justice.\r\n\r\nOn 26 March, 1269, was issued one of those ordinances against\r\nforestalling, of which many more followed for several centuries: no\r\ncitizen to go outside the city of London, either by road or river, to meet\r\nvictuals coming to market. In the 7th year of Edward I., clipping or\r\ndebasing the coinage was carried on so systematically that nearly three\r\nhundred persons, mostly of the Hebrew race, were drawn and hanged for it.\r\nIn the 11th year of Edward I. (1283) a statute had been directed against\r\ncheating by bakers and millers. Meanwhile the nobility retaliated by\r\nplundering the traders and merchants at Boston fair, and the king settled\r\nthe account with these marauding nobles by hanging them. A statute of\r\n1316, the second year of the famine, to fix the price of ale, has an\r\ninterest on account of its motive--“ne frumentum ulterius per potum\r\nconsumeretur.” The proportion of the corn of the country turned into malt,\r\nor the amount diverted from bread to beer, may be guessed from the fact\r\nthat in London, for which the beer ordinance was first made, there were in\r\n1309, brewhouses to the number of 1334, and taverns to the number of\r\n354[102]. In the very year of great famine, 1316, an ordinance was issued\r\n(in French, dated from King’s Langley) against extravagant\r\nhousekeeping[103]. In the year of great scarcity and mortality, 1322,\r\nthere was such a crowd for a funeral dole at Blackfriars (for the soul of\r\nHenry Fingret) that fifty-five persons, children and adults, were crushed\r\nto death in the scramble[104]. At the same time the prior of Christ\r\nChurch, Canterbury, was sitting down to dinners of seventeen dishes, the\r\ncellarer had thirty-eight servants under him, the chamberlain and sacrist\r\nhad large numbers of people employed as tailors, furriers, launderers and\r\nthe like, and the servants and equipages of the one hundred and forty\r\nbrethren were numerous and splendid[105]. The monasteries, on which the\r\nrelief of the poor mostly depended, have been thus characterized:\r\n\r\n    “From the end of the twelfth century until the Reformation,” says\r\n    Bishop Stubbs, “from the days of Hubert Walter to those of Wolsey, the\r\n    monasteries remained magnificent hostelries: their churches were\r\n    splendid chapels for noble patrons; their inhabitants were bachelor\r\n    country gentlemen, more polished and charitable, but little more\r\n    learned or more pure in life than their lay neighbours; their estates\r\n    were well managed, and enjoyed great advantages and exemptions; they\r\n    were, in fact, an element of peace in a nation that delighted in war.\r\n    But, with a few noble exceptions, there was nothing in the system that\r\n    did spiritual service[106].”\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said, at this period, of the profession most\r\ndirectly concerned with sickness, epidemic or other, namely the medical.\r\nWe become aware of its existence on rare occasions: as in the account of\r\nthe death of William the Conqueror at Rouen on 9 September, 1087, of the\r\nillness and death of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, on 13 July, 1205,\r\nat one of his manors on a journey to Rochester[107], or in the reference\r\nby William of Newburgh, to the noted Jewish physician of King’s Lynn,\r\nwhose honourable repute among the citizens for skill and modesty did not\r\nsave him from the murderous fanaticism against his race in 1190[108], or\r\nin occasional letters of the time[109]. There were doubtless benevolent\r\nmen among the practitioners of medicine, then as now; but the profession\r\nhas never been one in which individuals could rise conspicuously above the\r\nlevel of their age, and the moral standard of those centuries was a poor\r\none. It is not surprising, then, that John of Salisbury, indulging a taste\r\nfor epigram, should have characterized the profession of medicine in the\r\ntwelfth century as follows: “They have only two maxims which they never\r\nviolate, ‘Never mind the poor; never refuse money from the rich’[110].”\r\n\r\nThe one English physician whose writings have come down to us from the\r\nperiod that we are still engaged with, is John of Gaddesden. There is\r\nevery reason to think that he was practising at the time of the famine and\r\npestilence of 1315-16; but it is not from his bulky treatise on medicine\r\nthat we learn the nosological types of the epidemic maladies of those\r\nyears. Some account of his _Rosa Anglica_ will be found in the chapter on\r\nSmallpox; it must suffice to say here that he was a verbalist compiler\r\nfrom other books, themselves not altogether original, and that, according\r\nto Dr Freind, he displays no great knowledge of his profession.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing strange, therefore, that Gaddesden throws no light upon the\r\nfamine-pestilences of England, such as those of 1315-16, which he lived\r\nthrough. Dysentery and lientery, he treats of almost in the very words of\r\nGilbertus Anglicus; but those maladies might have been among the dwellers\r\nin another planet, so far as native experience comes in. He reproduces\r\nwhole chapters from his predecessors, on _synochus_ and _synocha_, without\r\na hint that England ever witnessed such scenes of hunger-typhus as the St\r\nAlbans chroniclers have recorded for us from their own observation. The\r\nreference by Trokelowe to the prevalence of _pestis gutturuosa_ in 1316,\r\nis one that a medical writer of the time might well have amplified; but\r\nGaddesden missed the opportunity of perhaps anticipating Fothergill’s\r\ndescription of putrid sore-throat by more than four hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemics of St Anthony’s Fire, or Ergotism.\r\n\r\nOne form of epidemic malady, intimately connected with bad harvests and a\r\npoor state of agriculture, namely Ergotism, from the mixture of poisoned\r\ngrains in the rye or other corn, is conspicuously missed from English\r\nrecords of the medieval period, although it plays a great part in the\r\nhistory of French epidemics of the Middle Ages, under such names as _ignis\r\nsacer_, _ignis S. Antonii_, or _ignis infernalis_. According to the\r\nproverbial saying already quoted, France was as notorious for _ignis_ as\r\nEngland for famine, and Normandy for lepra: “Tres plagae tribus regionibus\r\nappropriari solent, Anglorum fames, Gallorum ignis, Normannorum\r\nlepra[111].” The malady was of a nature to attract notice and excite pity;\r\nit is entered by chroniclers, and is a frequent topic in French legends of\r\nthe Saints. Its occurrence in epidemic form can be traced in France, with\r\na degree of probability, as far back as 857 (perhaps to 590); six great\r\noutbreaks are recorded in the tenth century, seven in the eleventh, ten in\r\nthe twelfth, and three in the thirteenth, the medieval series ending with\r\none in the year 1373. The estimates of mortality in the several epidemics\r\nof ergotism over a larger or smaller area of France, range as high as\r\n40,000, and 14,000, which numbers may be taken to be the roughest of\r\nguesses; but in later times upwards of 500 deaths from ergotism have been\r\naccurately counted in a single outbreak within a limited district. The\r\nepidemics have been observed in particular seasons, sometimes twenty years\r\nor more elapsing without the disease being seen; they have occurred also\r\nin particular provinces--in the basin of the Loire, in Lorraine, and,\r\nsince the close of the medieval period, especially in the Sologne. The\r\ndisease has usually been traced to a spoiled rye crop; but there is\r\nundoubted evidence from the more recent period that a poison with\r\ncorresponding effects can be produced in some other cereals, even in wheat\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn a field of rye, especially after a wet sowing or a wet season of\r\ngrowth, a certain proportion of the heads bear long brown or purple corns,\r\none or more upon a head, projecting in the shape of a cock’s spur, whence\r\nthe French name of ergot. The spur appears to be, and probably is, an\r\novergrown grain of rye; it is grooved like a rye-corn, occupies the place\r\nof the corn between the two chaff-coverings, and contains an abundant\r\nwhitish meal. Microscopic research has detected in or upon the spurred rye\r\nthe filaments of a minute parasitic mould; so that it is to the invasion\r\nby a parasite that we may trace the enormous overgrowth of one or more\r\ngrains on an ear, and it is probably to the ferment-action of the fungus\r\nthat we should ascribe the poisonous properties of the meal. The\r\nproportion of all the stalks in a field so affected will vary\r\nconsiderably, as well as the proportion of grains on each affected head of\r\ncorn[112]. Rye affected with ergot is apt to be a poor crop at any rate;\r\none or more spurred corns on a head tend to keep the rest of the grains\r\nsmall or unfilled; and if there be many stalks in the field so affected,\r\nthe spurred grain will bulk considerably in the whole yield. When the\r\ndiseased grains are ground to meal along with the healthy grains, the meal\r\nand the bread will contain an appreciable quantity of the poison of ergot;\r\nand if rye-bread were the staple food, there would be a great risk, after\r\nan unusually bad harvest, of an outbreak of the remarkable constitutional\r\neffects of ergotism. Rye-bread with much ergot in it may be rather blacker\r\nthan usual; but it is said to have no peculiar taste.\r\n\r\nIt is almost exclusively among the peasantry that symptoms of ergotism\r\nhave been seen, and among children particularly. The attack usually began\r\nwith intense pains in the legs or feet, causing the victims to writhe and\r\nscream. A fire seemed to burn between the flesh and the bones, and, at a\r\nlater stage, even in the bowels, the surface of the body being all the\r\nwhile cold as ice. Sometimes the skin of affected limbs became livid or\r\nblack; now and then large blebs or blisters arose upon it, as in bad kinds\r\nof erysipelas. Gangrene or sloughing of the extremities followed; a foot\r\nor a hand fell off, or the flesh of a whole limb was destroyed down to the\r\nbones, by a process which began in the deeper textures. The spontaneous\r\nseparation of a gangrenous hand or foot was on the whole a good sign for\r\nthe recovery of the patient. Such was the _ignis sacer_, or _ignis S.\r\nAntonii_ which figures prominently, I am told, in the French legends of\r\nthe Saints, and of which epidemics are recorded in the French medieval\r\nchronicles. Corresponding effects of ergotism may or may not have occurred\r\nduring the medieval period in other countries of Europe where rye was\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing is, that when we do begin in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries to obtain evidence of agrarian epidemics in Germany,\r\nSweden and Russia, which have eventually come to be identified, in the\r\nlight of more recent knowledge, with ergotism, the type of the disease is\r\ndifferent, not perhaps fundamentally or in the ultimate pathological\r\nanalysis, but at all events different as being a functional disorder of\r\nthe nervous system, instead of a disorder, on nervous lines, affecting the\r\nnutrition of parts and their structural integrity. This newer form,\r\ndistinctive of Germany and north-eastern Europe, was known by the name of\r\nKriebelkrankheit, from the creeping or itching sensations in the limbs at\r\nthe beginning of it; these heightened sensibilities often amounted to\r\nacute pain, as in the beginning of the gangrenous form also; but the\r\naffection of the sensory nerves, instead of leading to a breakdown in the\r\nnutrition of the parts and to gangrene, was followed by disorder of the\r\nmotor nerves,--by spasms of the hands and arms, feet and legs, very often\r\npassing into contractures of the joints which no force could unbend, and\r\nin some cases passing into periodic convulsive fits of the whole body like\r\nepilepsy, whence the name of convulsive ergotism[113].\r\n\r\nSide by side with these German, Swedish and Russian outbreaks of\r\nconvulsive ergotism, or Kriebelkrankheit (called by Linnaeus in Sweden by\r\nthe Latin name _raphania_), there had been a renewal or continuance of the\r\nmedieval epidemics in France, notably in the Sologne; but the French\r\nergotism has retained its old type of _ignis_ or gangrene. It was not\r\nuntil the eighteenth century that the learned world became clear as to the\r\nconnexion between either of those forms of disease among the peasantry and\r\na damaged rye-crop, although the country people themselves, and the\r\nobservant medical practitioners of the affected districts, had put this\r\nand that together long before. Thus, as late as 1672-75, there were\r\ncommunications made to the Paris Academy of Medicine[114] by observers in\r\nthe Sologne and especially around Montargis, in which ergot of rye is\r\nclearly described, as well as the associated symptoms of gangrenous\r\ndisease in the peasantry; but the connexion between the two was still\r\nregarded as open to doubt, and as a question that could only be settled by\r\nexperiment; while there is not a hint given that these modern outbreaks\r\nwere of the same nature as the notorious medieval _ignis sacer_. According\r\nto Häser, it was not until the French essay of Read (Strasbourg, 1771)\r\nthat the identity of the old _ignis_ with the modern gangrenous ergotism\r\nwas pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe result of the modern study of outbreaks of ergotism, including the\r\nminute record of individual cases, has been to show that there is no hard\r\nand fast line between the gangrenous and convulsive forms, that the French\r\nepidemics, although on the whole marked by the phenomena of gangrene, have\r\nnot been wanting in functional nervous symptoms, and that the German or\r\nnorthern outbreaks have often been of a mixed type. Thus, in the French\r\naccounts of 1676, “malign fevers accompanied with drowsiness and raving,”\r\nare mentioned along with “the gangrene in the arms but mostly in the legs,\r\nwhich ordinarily are corrupted first.”\r\n\r\nAgain, the observations of Th. O. Heusinger[115] on an outbreak near\r\nMarburg in 1855-56, led him decidedly to conclude for the essential\r\nsameness of _ignis_ and Kriebelkrankheit, and for the existence of a\r\nmiddle type, although undoubtedly the sensory and motor disorders,\r\nincluding hyperaesthesia, pain and anaesthesia on the one hand, and\r\ncontractures of the joints, choreic movements and convulsions on the\r\nother, were more distinctive of the epidemics of ergotism on German or\r\nnorthern European soil.\r\n\r\nThus far the foreign experience of ergotism, both medieval and modern, and\r\nof its several types. We shall now be in a position to examine the English\r\nrecords for indications of the same effects of damaged grain.\r\n\r\nIn the English medieval chronicles an occasional reference may be found to\r\n_ignis_ or wild fire. The reference to wild fire in Derbyshire in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 1049, probably means some\r\nmeteorological phenomenon, elsewhere called _ignis sylvaticus_: “Eac þ\r\nwilde fyr on Deorbyscire micel yfel dyde[116].” Whatever the _ignis\r\nsylvaticus_ or _ignis aereus_ was, which destroyed houses as well as\r\ncrops, there appears to be no warrant for the conclusion of C. F.\r\nHeusinger that it was the same as the _ignis sacer_ of the French\r\npeasantry[117]. An undoubted reference to _ignis infernalis_ as a human\r\nmalady occurs in the _Topography of Ireland_ by Giraldus Cambrensis: a\r\ncertain archer who had ravished a woman at St Fechin’s mill at Fore was\r\novertaken by swift vengeance, “igne infernali in membro percussus, usque\r\nin ipsum corpus statim exarsit, et nocte eadem exspiravit.” Taking the\r\nincident as legendary, and the diagnosis as valueless, we may still\r\nconclude that the name, at least, of _ignis infernalis_ was familiar to\r\nEnglish writers. But in all the accounts of English famines and\r\nwide-spread sicknesses in the medieval period which have been extracted\r\nfrom the nearest contemporary authorities, I have found no mention of any\r\ndisease that might correspond to ergotism[118].\r\n\r\nThe first undoubted instance of ergotism in England belongs to the\r\neighteenth century. On or about the 10th of January, 1762, a peasant’s\r\nfamily (father, mother, and six children) of Wattisham in Suffolk, were\r\nattacked almost simultaneously with the symptoms of gangrenous ergotism,\r\nseveral of them eventually losing portions of their limbs. The disease\r\nbegan with intense pain in the legs, and contractures of the hands and\r\nfeet. It was proved that they had not been using rye flour; but their\r\nbread for a short time before had been made exclusively from damaged\r\nwheat, grown in the neighbourhood and kept apart from the farmer’s good\r\ncorn so as not to spoil his sample. It had been sent to the mill just\r\nbefore Christmas, and had been used by some others besides the family who\r\ndeveloped the symptoms of ergotism[119].\r\n\r\nIn that authentic instance of ergotism (although not from rye), there was\r\none symptom, the contractures of the hands and feet, which is distinctive\r\nof the convulsive form; so that the English type may be said to have been\r\na mixture of the French form and of the form special to the north-eastern\r\ncountries of Europe. With that instance as a type, let us now inquire\r\nwhether any epidemics in England at earlier periods may not be brought\r\nunder the head of ergotism. It is to be kept in mind that none of the\r\nmedieval outbreaks were called by their present name, or traced to their\r\ntrue source, until centuries after; so that our task is, not to search the\r\nrecords for the name of ergotism, but to scrutinize any anomalous outbreak\r\nof disease, or any outbreak distinguished in the chronicles by some\r\nunusual mark, with a view to discovering whether it suits the hypothesis\r\nof ergotism. I shall have to speak of three such outbreaks in the\r\nfourteenth century, and of one in Lancashire and Cheshire in 1702[120].\r\n\r\nThe first of these is given by Knighton for a period and a locality that\r\nmay have been within his own cognizance. In the summer of 1340 there\r\nhappened in England generally, but especially in the county of Leicester,\r\na certain deplorable and enormous infirmity. It was marked by paroxysms or\r\nfits, attended by intolerable suffering; while the fit lasted, the victims\r\nemitted a noise like the barking of dogs. A “great pestilence,” or perhaps\r\na great mortality, is said to have ensued[121]. In that record the salient\r\npoints are, firstly the wide or epidemic incidence of the malady, at all\r\nevents in Leicestershire, which was Knighton’s own county; secondly the\r\nparoxysmal nature of the attacks, and the strange noises emitted\r\ntherewith; thirdly the intolerable suffering (_poena_) that attended each\r\nfit (_passio_). Except for the clear indication of pain, one might think\r\nof the strange hysterical outbreaks, extending, by a kind of psychical\r\ncontagion, to whole communities, which were observed about the same period\r\nin some parts of the continent of Europe. But of these medieval\r\npsychopathies, as they are called, there is hardly any trace in England.\r\nThe Flagellants came over from Zealand to London in 1349, and gave\r\nexhibitions at St Paul’s, but that pseudo-religious mania does not appear\r\nto have taken hold among the English. The epidemic recorded by Knighton\r\nhad probably a more material cause. To illustrate the somewhat meagre\r\nreference by Knighton to the strange epidemic of 1340, I shall proceed at\r\nonce to the remarkable outbreak in Lancashire and Cheshire in 1702, which\r\nwas clearly not a psychopathy or hysterical outbreak, and yet had a\r\nseemingly hysterical element in it. An account of it was sent to the Royal\r\nSociety by Dr Charles Leigh “of Lancashire[122].”\r\n\r\n    “We have this year [1702] had an epidemical fever, attended with very\r\n    surprising symptoms. In the beginning, the patient was frequently\r\n    attacked with the colica ventriculi; convulsions in various parts,\r\n    sometimes violent vomitings, and a dysentery; the jaundice, and in\r\n    many of them, a suppression of urine; and what urine was made was\r\n    highly saturated with choler. About the state of the distemper, large\r\n    purple spots appeared, and on each side of ’em two large blisters,\r\n    which continued three or four days: these blisters were so placed\r\n    about the spots that they might in some measure be term’d satellites\r\n    or tenders: of these there were in many four different eruptions. But\r\n    the most remarkable instance I saw in the fever was in a poor boy of\r\n    Lymm in Cheshire, one John Pownel, about 13 years of age, who was\r\n    affected with the following symptoms:--\r\n\r\n    “Upon the crisis or turn of the fever, he was seized with an aphonia,\r\n    and was speechless six weeks [? days], with the following convulsions:\r\n    the distemper infested the nerves of both arms and legs which produced\r\n    the Chorea Sancti Viti, or St Vitus’s dance; and the legs sometimes\r\n    were both so contracted that no person could reduce them to their\r\n    natural position. Besides these, he had most terrible symptoms, which\r\n    began in the following manner: [description of convulsions follows]\r\n    ... and then he barked in all the usual notes of a dog, sometimes\r\n    snarling, barking, and at the last howling like an hound. After this\r\n    the nerves of the mandibles were convulsed, and then the jaws clashed\r\n    together with that violence that several of his teeth were beaten out,\r\n    and then at several times there came a great foam from his mouth....\r\n    These symptoms were so amazing that several persons about him believed\r\n    he was possessed. I told them there was no ground for such\r\n    suppositions, but that the distemper was natural, and a species of an\r\n    epilepsy, and by the effects I convinced them of the truth of it; for\r\n    in a week’s time I recovered the boy his speech, his senses returned,\r\n    his convulsions vanished, and the boy is now very cheerful. There have\r\n    been other persons in this country much after the same manner.”\r\n\r\nThis epidemic of 1702 in Lancashire and Cheshire was recorded as something\r\nunusual. It had certain intestinal symptoms such as colic, which may well\r\nhave followed the use of poisoned food and are indeed described among the\r\nsymptoms of ergotism; there were also convulsions, large purple spots with\r\nblisters coming and going on the skin near them, and, in the single case\r\nthat is given with details, there were contractures of the legs “so that\r\nno person could reduce them to their natural position,” and a continuance\r\nfor several days of painful epileptiform fits attended with noises like\r\nthe barking of a dog, or the hissing of a goose, “all which different\r\nsounds (I take it) proceed from the different contractions of the lungs\r\nvariously forcing out the air.” The remarkable case of the boy, certified\r\nby several witnesses, is expressly given as one belonging to the general\r\nepidemic of the locality, others having been affected “much after the same\r\nmanner.” Whatever suggestion there may be of ergotism in these\r\nparticulars, nothing is said of gangrene of the limbs, although the livid\r\nspots and blisters are part of the symptoms of gangrenous ergotism, just\r\nas the convulsions and contractures are of convulsive ergotism. In the\r\nSuffolk cases of 1762 there were both contractures of the limbs and\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nKnighton’s mention of the barking noises emitted by the sufferers of 1340\r\nhas suggested to Nichols, the author of the _History of\r\nLeicestershire_[123], a comparison of them with the cases investigated by\r\nDr Freind in the year 1700, at the village of Blackthorn in Oxfordshire.\r\nHaving heard a great rumour in the summer of that year that certain girls\r\nat that Oxfordshire village were taken with frequent barkings like dogs,\r\nDr Freind made a journey to the place to investigate the cases[124].\r\n\r\n    He found that this _pestis_ or plague had invaded two families in the\r\n    village, on terms of close intimacy with each other. Two or three\r\n    girls in each family are specially referred to: they were seized at\r\n    intervals of a few hours with spasms of the neck and mouth, attended\r\n    by vociferous cries; the spasmodic movements increased to a climax,\r\n    when the victims sank exhausted. The fits had kept occurring for\r\n    several weeks, and had appeared in the second family at a considerable\r\n    interval after the first. The symptoms, said Freind, were those that\r\n    had been described by Seidelius--distortion of the mouth, indecorous\r\n    working of the tongue, and noises emitted like barking. He found\r\n    nothing in the girls’ symptoms that could not be referred to a form of\r\n    St Vitus’ dance or to hysteria, in which maladies, laughter, howling\r\n    and beating of the breast are occasionally seen as well as the\r\n    spasmodic working of the neck and limbs.\r\n\r\nThe question remains whether the cases of 1700 in the Oxfordshire village,\r\nassuming Dr Freind’s reading of them to be correct, were as illustrative\r\nof the outbreak of 1340 as the cases of 1702 in Lancashire and Cheshire,\r\nwhich were probably too numerous and too much complicated with symptoms\r\nof material toxic disorder to be explained as hysterical. There is,\r\nindeed, a larger question raised, whether the so-called psychopathies of\r\nthe medieval and more recent periods may not have had a beginning, at\r\nleast, in some toxic property of the staple food. The imagination readily\r\nfixes upon such symptoms as foaming at the mouth and barking noises,\r\nexalts these phenomena over deeper symptoms that a physician might have\r\ndetected, and finds a simple explanation of the whole complex seizure as\r\ndemoniac possession or, in modern phrase, as a psychopathy. Without\r\nquestioning the subjective or imitative nature of many outbreaks which\r\nhave been set down to hysteria, it may be well to use some discrimination\r\nbefore we exclude altogether an element of material poisoning such as\r\nergot in the staple food, more especially in the case of the wide-spread\r\nhysterical epidemics of Sweden, a country subject to ergotism also[125].\r\n\r\nThese eighteenth-century instances have been brought in to illustrate\r\nKnighton’s account of the epidemic of 1340. The next strange outbreak of\r\nthe fourteenth century is recorded by the St Albans historian\r\n(“Walsingham”) under a year between 1361 and 1365, probably the year 1362.\r\nLike so many more of the medieval records of epidemic sickness, it is a\r\nmeagre and confused statement: “Numbers died of the disease of lethargy,\r\nprophesying troubles to many; many women also died by the flux; and there\r\nwas a general murrain of cattle[126].” Along with that enigmatical entry,\r\nwe may take the last of the kind that here concerns us. At Cambridge, in\r\n1389, there occurred an epidemic of “phrensy;” it is described as “a great\r\nand formidable pestilence, which arose suddenly, and in which men were\r\nattacked all at once by the disease of phrensy of the mind, dying without\r\nthe _viaticum_, and in a state of unconsciousness[127].” The names of\r\nphrensy and lethargy occur in the manuscript medical treatises of the time\r\nin the chapters upon diseases of the brain and nerves[128]; strictly they\r\nare names of symptoms, and not of forms or types of disease, and they may\r\nbe used loosely of various morbid states which have little in common. A\r\nlethargy would in some cases be a name for coma in fever, or for a\r\nparalytic stroke; a phrensy might be actual mania, or it might be the\r\ndelirium of plague or typhus fever. The “lethargy” of 1362 is alleged of a\r\nnumber of people as if in an epidemic, whatever the singular phrase\r\n“prophetantes infortunia multis” may mean; and the “phrensy of the mind”\r\nof which many died suddenly at Cambridge in 1389, does not look as if it\r\nhad been a symptom of plague or pestilential fever. The judicious reader\r\nwill make what he can of these disappointingly meagre details. But for his\r\nguidance it may be added that the French accounts of ergotism in 1676 give\r\none of the poisonous effects as being “to cause sometimes malign fevers\r\naccompanied with drowsiness and raving,” which terms might stand for\r\nlethargy and phrensy; also that it has not always been easy, in an\r\nepidemic among the peasantry after a bad harvest, to distinguish the cases\r\nof ergotism from the cases of typhus, the contractures of the limbs, which\r\nseem so special to ergotism, having been described also for undoubted\r\ncases of typhus[129].\r\n\r\nWhether these anomalous epidemics in medieval England were instances of\r\nconvulsive ergotism or not, the English records are on the whole wanting\r\nin the evidence of such wide-spread and frequent disasters from a poisoned\r\nharvest as distinguish the French annals of the same period. One reason of\r\nour immunity may have been that the grain was better grown; another reason\r\ncertainly is that rye was a comparatively rare crop in England, wheaten\r\nbread being preferred, although bread made from beans and barley was not\r\nuncommon. Thorold Rogers says: “Rye was scantily cultivated. An occasional\r\ncrop on many estates, it is habitually sown in few. It is regularly sown\r\nin Cambridgeshire and some other of the eastern counties. As the period\r\nbefore us passes on [1259-1400], it becomes still more rare, and as will\r\nbe seen below, some of the later years of this enquiry contain no entries\r\nof its purchase and sale[130].” But it is clear from the entries in\r\nchronicles, more particularly about the very period of the fourteenth\r\ncentury to which the three epidemics suggestive of ergotism belong, that\r\nthe English peasantry suffered from the poisonous effects of damaged food,\r\neven if they suffered little from spurred rye. Thus, under the year 1383,\r\nin the history known as Walsingham’s, there is an unmistakeable reference\r\nto many fatalities, as well as serious maladies, caused by the eating of\r\ndamaged fruit[131]. Again, under 1391, it is stated that this was “a hard\r\nand difficult year for the poor owing to a dearth of fruits, which had now\r\nlasted two years; whence it happened that at the time of the nuts and\r\napples, many of the poor died of dysentery brought on by eating them; and\r\nthe pestilence would have been worse had it not been for the laudable\r\ndiligence of the Mayor of London, who caused corn to be brought to London\r\nfrom over sea[132].”\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneralities on Medieval Famines in England.\r\n\r\nSumming up the English famine-pestilences of the medieval period, we find\r\nthat they included the usual forms of such sickness--spotted fever of the\r\nnature of typhus, dysentery, lientery or looseness (such as has often\r\nsubsequently accompanied typhus or famine-fever in Ireland), and putrid\r\nsore-throat. That some of these effects were due to spoiled grain and\r\nfruits, as well as to absolute want, we may reasonably conclude; for\r\nexample the harvest of 1258 rotted on the ground, and yet the mouldy corn\r\nwas sold at famine prices. With all those records of famines and their\r\nattendant sicknesses in England, it is significant that there is little\r\nindication of ergotism. The immunity of England from ergotism, with such a\r\nrecord of famines as the annals show, can only have been because little\r\nrye was grown and little black bread eaten. The standard of living would\r\nappear to have been higher among the English peasantry than among the\r\nFrench. A bad harvest, still more two bad harvests in succession, made\r\nthem feel the pinch of famine more acutely, perhaps, than if they had\r\naccommodated themselves to the more sober level of rye bread. Hence the\r\nsomewhat paradoxical but doubtless true saying of the Middle\r\nAges--“Anglorum fames, Francorum ignis.” The saying really means, not that\r\nEngland was a poor country, which would be an absurd repute for foreigners\r\nto have fixed upon her; but that the English were subject to alternating\r\nperiods of abundance and scarcity, of surfeit and starvation. The earliest\r\nEnglish work which deals fully and concretely with the social condition of\r\nthe country is the fourteenth-century poem of “The Vision of Piers the\r\nPloughman.” A few passages from that poem will be of use as throwing light\r\nupon the famines of England, before we finally leave the period of which\r\nthey are characteristic.\r\n\r\nLangland’s poem describes the social state of England in peculiar\r\ncircumstances, namely, after the upheaval and dislocation of the Great\r\nMortality of 1349; and in that respect it has an interest for our subject\r\nwhich comes into a later chapter. But in so far as it illustrates the\r\nalternating periods of abundance and scarcity, the vision of medieval\r\nEngland concerns us here before we quit the subject of famine-pestilences.\r\nThe average industrious ploughman, represented by Piers himself, fares but\r\nsoberly until Lammas comes round[133]:--\r\n\r\n  “I have no penny, quod Piers, pullets for to buy,\r\n   Ne neither geese nor pigs, but two green cheeses,\r\n   A few cruddes and cream, and an haver-cake,\r\n   And two loaves of beans and bran ybake for my fauntis.\r\n   And yet I say, by my soul, I have no salt bacon,\r\n   Nor no cookeney, by Christ, collops for to maken.\r\n   And I have percil and porettes and many kole-plantes,\r\n   And eke a cow and a calf, and a cart-mare\r\n   To draw afield my dung the while the drought lasteth.\r\n   And by this lyflode me mot live till lammas time;\r\n   And by that I hope to have harvest in my croft;\r\n   And then may I digte thy dinner as me dear liketh.”\r\n\r\nSome are worse off than the ploughman in the slack time before the\r\nharvest:\r\n\r\n  “All the poor people tho pesecoddes fetched,\r\n   Beans and baken apples they brought in their lappes,\r\n   Chibolles and chervelles and ripe cherries many,\r\n   And proferred Piers this present to plead with Hunger.\r\n   All Hunger ate in haste, and axed after more.\r\n   Then poor folk for fear fed Hunger eagerlie,\r\n   With green poret and pesen, to poison Hunger they thought.\r\n   By that it nighed near harvest, new corn came to chipping.\r\n   Then was folk fain, and fed Hunger with the best,\r\n   With good ale, as glutton taught, and gerte Hunger go sleep.\r\n   And though would waster not work but wandren about,\r\n   Ne no beggar eat bread that beans in were,\r\n   But of cocket or clerematyn or else of clean wheat:\r\n   Ne no halfpenny ale in none wise drink,\r\n   But of the best and of the brownest that in burgh is to sell.\r\n   Labourers that have no land to live on, but their hands,\r\n   Deigned nought to dine a-day night-old wortes.\r\n   May no penny ale them pay ne no piece of bacon,\r\n   But if it be fresh flesh other fish fried other bake.”\r\n\r\nThe waster being now in his season of plenty falls to abusing the Statute\r\nof Labourers:\r\n\r\n  “And then cursed he the king and all his council after,\r\n   Such laws to loke, labourers to grieve.\r\n   But whiles Hunger was their master there would none of them chide,\r\n   Nor strive against _his_ statute, so sternly he looked.\r\n   And I warn you, workmen, wynneth while ye mowe,\r\n   For Hunger hitherward hasteth him fast.\r\n   He shall awake with water wasters to chasten.\r\n   Ere five year be fulfilled such famine shall arise\r\n   Through floods and through foul weathers fruits shall fail.\r\n   And so said Saturn, and sent you to warn ...\r\n   Then shall death withdraw and dearth be justice,\r\n   And Daw the dyker die for hunger,\r\n   But if God of his goodness grant us a truce.”\r\n\r\nHe proposes to feed the lazy wasters on beans:\r\n\r\n  “And gif the groomes grudge, bid them go swynk,\r\n   And he shall sup the sweeter when he hath deserved.”\r\n\r\nThe ploughman asks Hunger the reason why both himself and his servants are\r\nunable to work:\r\n\r\n  “I wot well, quod Hunger, what sickness you aileth.\r\n   Ye have maunged over much, and that maketh you groan ...\r\n   Let not sir Surfeit sitten at thy board ...\r\n   And gif thy diet be thus, I dare lay mine ears\r\n   That Physic shall his furred hoods for his food sell,\r\n   And his cloak of calabre with all the knaps of gold,\r\n   And be fain, by my faith, his physic to let,\r\n   And learn to labour with land, for lyflode is sweet:\r\n   For murtherers are many leeches, Lord them amend!\r\n   They do men kill through their drinks, or destiny it would.\r\n   By Saint Poul, quod Piers, these aren profitable words.”\r\n\r\nIn another place, Hawkin the minstrel confesses to gluttony:\r\n\r\n  “And more meat ate and drank than nature might digest,\r\n   And caught sickness some time for my surfeits oft.”\r\n\r\nA liking for the best of food, and plenty of it, when it was to be had,\r\nhas clearly been an English trait from the earliest times. Conversely\r\nthrift does not appear to have been a virtue or a grace of the labouring\r\nclass in England. Thus a bad harvest brought wide-spread scarcity, and two\r\nbad harvests brought famine and famine-pestilences. The contrasts were\r\nsharp because the standard of living was high. And although three, at\r\nleast, of the English famines were disgraceful to so rich a country, and\r\nwere probably the occasion of the foreign reproach of “Anglorum fames;”\r\nyet the significant fact remains that the disease of the European\r\npeasantry, which is the truest index of an inferior diet, namely ergotism,\r\nhas little or no place in our annals of sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLEPROSY IN MEDIEVAL BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of leprosy in Britain can hardly be the history of leprosy\r\nalone, but of that disease along with others which were either mistaken\r\nfor it or conveniently and euphemistically included under it. That there\r\nwas leprosy in the country is undoubted; but it is just as certain that\r\nthere was _lues venerea_; that the latter as a primary lesion led an\r\nanonymous existence or was called _lepra_ or _morphaea_ if it were called\r\nanything; that the remote effects of the lues were not known as such,\r\nbeing taken for detached or original outcomes of the disordered humours\r\nand therefore in the same general class as leprous manifestations; and\r\nthat the popular and clerical notions of leprosy were too superstitious\r\nand inexact, even if the diagnostic intention had been more resolute than\r\nit was, to permit of any clear separation of the leprous from the\r\nsyphilitic, to say nothing of their separation from the poor victims of\r\nlupus and cancer of the face, of scrofulous running sores, or of neglected\r\nskin-eruptions more repulsive to the eye than serious in their nature. I\r\nshall give some proof of each of those assertions--as an essential\r\npreliminary to any correct handling of the historical records of British\r\nleprosy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeprosy in Medieval Medical Treatises.\r\n\r\nThe picture given of true leprosy in the medieval treatises on medicine is\r\nunmistakeable. There are two systematic writers about the year 1300 who\r\nhave left a better account of it than the Arabian authors from whom they\r\nmostly copied. While the writers in question have transferred whole\r\nchapters unaltered from Avicenna, Rhazes and Theodoric, they have improved\r\nupon their models in the stock chapter ‘De Lepra.’ It so happens that\r\nthose two writers, Bernard Gordonio and Gilbertus Anglicus, bear names\r\nwhich have been taken to indicate British nationality, and the picture of\r\nleprosy by the latter has actually been adduced as a contemporary account\r\nof the disease observed in England[134]. Gordonio was a professor at\r\nMontpellier, and his experience and scholarship are purely foreign. The\r\ncircumstances of Gilbert the Englishman are not so well known; but it is\r\ntolerably certain that he was not, as often assumed, the Gilbert Langley,\r\nGilbert de l’Aigle, or Gilbertus de Aquila, who was physician to Hubert,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury († 13 July, 1205)[135], having been a pupil at\r\nSalerno in the time of Aegidius of Corbeil (about 1180). The treatise of\r\nGilbertus Anglicus bears internal evidence of a later century and school;\r\nit is distinguished by method and comprehensiveness, and is almost exactly\r\non the lines of the _Lilium Medicinae_ by Gordonio, whose date at\r\nMontpellier is known with some exactness to have been from 1285 to about\r\n1307. Future research may perhaps discover where Gilbert taught or was\r\ntaught; meanwhile we may safely assume that his scholarship and system\r\nwere of a foreign colour. The medical writer of that time in England was\r\nJohn of Gaddesden, mentioned in the end of the foregoing chapter; he is\r\nthe merest plagiary, and the one or two original remarks in his chapter\r\n‘De Lepra’ would almost justify the epithet of “fatuous” which Guy de\r\nChauliac applied to him.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot appeal to Gilbertus Anglicus for native English\r\nexperience any more than we can to his _alter ego_, Gordonio, yet we may\r\nassume that the picture of leprosy which they give might have been\r\nsketched in England as well as in Italy or in Provence. The conditions\r\nwere practically uniform throughout Christendom; the true leprosy of any\r\none part of medieval Europe is the true leprosy of the whole.\r\n\r\nGilbert’s picture[136], as we have said, is unmistakeable, and the same\r\nmight be said of Bernard’s[137]--the eyebrows falling bare and getting\r\nknotted with uneven tuberosities, the nose and other features becoming\r\nthick, coarse and lumpy, the face losing its mobility or play of\r\nexpression, the raucous voice, the loss of sensibility in the hands, and\r\nthe ultimate break-up or _naufragium_ of the leprous growths into foul\r\nrunning sores. The enumeration of nervous symptoms, which are now\r\nrecognised to be fundamental in the pathology of leprosy, shows that\r\nGilbert went below the surface. Among the “signa leprae generalia” he\r\nmentions such forms of hyperaesthesia as _formicatio_ (the creeping of\r\nants), and the feeling of “needles and pins;” and, in the way of\r\nanaesthesia, he speaks of the loss of sensibility from the little finger\r\nto the elbow, as well as in the exposed parts where the blanched spots or\r\nthickenings come--the forehead, cheeks, eyebrows, to which he adds the\r\ntongue. Gilbert’s whole chapter ‘De Lepra’ is an obvious improvement upon\r\nthe corresponding one in Avicenna, who says that _lepra_ is a cancer of\r\nthe whole body, cancer being the _lepra_ of a single member, and is\r\nprobably confusing lupus with leprosy when he describes the cartilages of\r\nthe nose as corroded in the latter, and the nostrils destroyed by the same\r\nkind of _naufragium_ as the fingers and toes. All students of the history\r\nor clinical characters of leprosy, from Guy de Chauliac, who wrote about\r\n1350, down to Hensler and Sprengel, have recognised in Gilbert’s and\r\nBernard’s account of it the marks of first-hand observation; so that we\r\nmay take it, without farther debate, that leprosy, as correctly diagnosed,\r\nwas a disease of Europe and of Britain in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nHaving got so far, we come next to a region of almost inextricable\r\nconfusion, a region of secrecy and mystification, as well as of real\r\ncontemporary ignorance. We may best approach it by one or two passages\r\nfrom Gilbert and Gordonio themselves. The systematic handling of _lepra_\r\nin their writings is one thing, and their more concrete remarks on its\r\nconditions of origin, its occasions, or circumstances are another. What\r\nare we to make of this kind of leprosy?--“In hoc genere, causa est\r\naccessus ad mulierem ad quam accessit prius leprosus; et corrumpit\r\nvelocius vir sanus quam mulier a leproso.... Et penetrant [venena] in\r\nnervos calidos et arterias et venas viriles, et inficiunt spiritus et\r\nbubones, et hoc velocius si mulier,” etc. Or to quote Gilbert again: “Ex\r\naccessu ad mulieres, diximus superius, lepram in plerisque generari post\r\ncoitûs leprosos[138].” Or in Gordonio: “Et provenit [lepra] etiam ex nimia\r\nconfibulatione cum leprosis, et ex coitu cum leprosa, et qui jacuit cum\r\nmuliere cum qua jacuit leprosus[139].” That these circumstances of\r\ncontracting _lepra_ were not mere verbal theorizings inspired by the\r\npathology of the day and capable of being now set aside, is obvious from a\r\n_historia_ or case which Gordonio introduces into his text. “I shall tell\r\nwhat happened,” he says; and then proceeds to the following relation:[140]\r\n\r\n“Quaedam comtissa venit leprosa ad Montem Pessulanum [Montpellier], et\r\nerat in fine in cura mea; et quidam Baccalarius in medicina ministrabat\r\nei, et jacuit cum ea, et impregnavit eam, et perfectissime leprosus factus\r\nest.” Happy is he therefore, he adds, who learns caution from the risks of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHere we have sufficient evidence, from the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, of a disease being called _lepra_ which does not conform to the\r\nconditions of leprosy as we now understand them. The same confusion\r\nbetween leprosy and the _lues venerea_ prevailed through the whole\r\nmedieval period. Thus, in the single known instance of a severe edict\r\nagainst lepers in England, the order of Edward III. to the mayor and\r\nsheriffs of London in 1346[141], the reasons for driving lepers out of the\r\nCity are given,--among others, because they communicate their disease “by\r\ncarnal intercourse with women in stews and other secret places,” and by\r\ntheir polluted breath. It was pointed out long ago by Beckett in his\r\npaper on the antiquity of the _lues venerea_[142], that the polluted\r\nbreath was characteristic of the latter, but not of leprosy. Of course the\r\npollution of their breath might have meant no more than the theoretical\r\nreasoning of the books (as in Gilbert, where the breath of lepers, as well\r\nas the mere sight of them, is said to give the disease, p. 337), but the\r\nbreath was probably obnoxious in a more real way, just as we know, from\r\nGordonio’s case at Montpellier, that the other alleged source of “leprous”\r\ncontagion was no mere theoretical deduction. As the medieval period came\r\nto an end the leper-houses (in France) were found to contain a\r\nmiscellaneous gathering of cases generically called leprous; and about the\r\nsame time, the year 1488, an edict of the same purport as Edward III.’s\r\nLondon one of 1346, was issued by the provost of Paris against _les\r\nlépreux_ of that city. The year 1488 is so near the epidemic outburst of\r\nthe _morbus Gallicus_ during the French campaigns on Italian soil in\r\n1494-95, that the historian has not hesitated to set down that sudden\r\nreappearance of leprous contagion, in a proclamation of the State, to a\r\nreal prevalence already in Paris of the contagious malady which was to be\r\nheard of to the farthest corners of Europe a few years after[143].\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in producing evidence from medieval English records\r\nof the prevalence of _lues venerea_, which was not concealed under the\r\neuphemistic or mistaken diagnosis of leprosy. Instances of a very bad\r\nkind, authenticated with the names of the individuals, are given in\r\nGascoigne’s _Liber Veritatum_, under the date of 1433[144].\r\n\r\nIn the medieval text-books of Avicenna, Gilbert and others, there are\r\ninvariably paragraphs on _pustulae et apostemata virgae_. In the only\r\noriginal English medical work of those times, by John Ardern, who was\r\npractising at Newark from 1349 to 1370, and came afterwards to London,\r\nappearances are described which can mean nothing else than\r\ncondylomata[145]. From a manuscript prescription-book of the medieval\r\nperiod, in the British Museum, I have collected some receipts (or their\r\nheadings) which relate, as an index of later date prefixed to the MS.\r\nsays, to “the pox of old[146].”\r\n\r\nSome have refused to see in such cases any real correspondence with the\r\nmodern forms of syphilis because only local effects are described and no\r\nconstitutional consequences traced. But no one in those times thought of a\r\nprimary focus of infection with its remoter effects at large, in the case\r\nof any disease whatsoever. Even in the great epidemic of syphilis at the\r\nend of the fifteenth century, the sequence of primary and secondary\r\n(tertiaries were unheard of until long after), was not at first\r\nunderstood; the eruption of the skin, which was compared to a bad kind of\r\nvariola, the imposthumes of the head and of the bones elsewhere, together\r\nwith all other constitutional or general symptoms, were traced, in good\r\nfaith, to a disordered liver, an organ which was chosen on theoretical\r\ngrounds as the _minera morbi_ or laboratory of the disease[147]. The\r\ncircumstances of the great epidemic were, of course, special, but they\r\nwere not altogether new. No medieval miracle could have been more of a\r\nsuspension of the order of nature than that _luxuria_, _immunditia_, and\r\n_foeditas_, with their attendant _corruptio membrorum_, should have been\r\nfree from those consequences, in the individual and in the community,\r\nwhich are more familiar in our own not less clean-living days merely\r\nbecause the sequence of events is better understood. That such vices\r\nabounded in the medieval world we have sufficient evidence. They were\r\nnotorious among the Norman conquerors of England, especially notorious in\r\nthe reign of William Rufus[148]; hence, perhaps, the significance of the\r\nphrase _lepra Normannorum_. That particular vice which amounts to a felony\r\nwas the subject of the sixth charge (unproved) in the indictment of the\r\norder of the Templars before the Pope Clement V. in 1307. Effects on the\r\npublic health traceable to such causes, for the most part _sub rosa_, have\r\nbeen often felt in the history of nations, from the Biblical episode of\r\nBaal-peor down to modern times. The evidence is written at large in the\r\nworks of Astruc, Hensler and Rosenbaum. We are here concerned with a much\r\nsmaller matter, namely, any evidence from England which may throw light\r\nupon the classes of cases that were called leprous if they were called by\r\na name at all.\r\n\r\nUnder the year 1258, Matthew Paris introduces a singular paragraph, which\r\nis headed, “The Bishop of Hereford smitten with polypus.” The bishop, a\r\nProvençal, had made himself obnoxious by his treacherous conduct as the\r\nagent of Henry III. at the Holy See in the matter of the English subsidies\r\nto the pope. Accordingly it was by the justice of God that he was deformed\r\nby a most disgraceful disease, to wit, _morphea_, or again, “morphea\r\npolipo, vel quadam specie leprae[149].” According to the medical teaching\r\nof the time, as we find it in Gilbertus Anglicus, _morphaea_ was an\r\ninfection producing a change in the natural colour of the skin; it was\r\nconfined to the skin, whereas _lepra_ was in the flesh also; the former\r\nwas curable, the latter incurable; _morphaea_ might be white, red, or\r\nblack[150]. The account of _morphaea_ by Gordonio is somewhat fuller. All\r\nthings, he says, that are causes of _lepra_ are causes of _morphaea_; so\r\nthat what is in the flesh _lepra_ is _morphaea_ in the skin. It was a\r\npatchy discoloration of the skin, reddish, yellowish, whitish, dusky, or\r\nblack, producing _terribilis aspectus_; curable if recent, incurable if of\r\nlong standing; curable also if of moderate extent, but difficult to cure\r\nif of great extent[151]. In this description by Gordonio a modern French\r\nwriter on leprosy[152] discovers the classical characters of the syphilis\r\nof our own day: “not one sign is wanting.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt the medical writers drew a distinction between _morphaea_ and\r\n_lepra_, as we have seen in quoting Gilbert and Gordonio. Gaddesden, also,\r\nwho mostly copies them, interpolates here an original remark. No one\r\nshould be adjudged leprous, he says, and separated from his fellows,\r\nmerely because the “figure and form” (the stock phrase) of the face are\r\ncorrupted: the disease might be “scabies foeda,” or if in the feet, it\r\nmight be “cancer.” Nodosities or tubercles should not be taken to mean\r\nleprosy, unless they are confirmed (inveterate) in the face[153]. But how\r\nuncertain are these diagnostic indications, as between _lepra_ and\r\n_morphaea_, _lepra_ and “scabies foeda,” _lepra_ and “cancer in pedibus!”\r\nIf there were any object in calling the disease by one name rather than\r\nanother, it is clear that the same disease might be called by a euphemism\r\nin one case and by a term meant to be opprobrious in another. Although\r\nleprosy was not in general a disease that anyone might wish to be credited\r\nwith, yet there were circumstances when the diagnosis of leprosy had its\r\nadvantages. It was of use to a beggar or tramp to be called a leper: he\r\nwould excite more pity, he might get admission to a hospital, and he might\r\nsolicit alms, under royal privilege, although begging in ordinary was\r\npunishable. It is conceivable also that the diagnosis of leprosy was a\r\nconvenient one for men in conspicuous positions in Church and State. It is\r\nmost improbable that the “lepra Normannorum” was all leprosy; it is absurd\r\nto suppose that leprosy became common in Europe because returning\r\nCrusaders introduced it from the East, as if leprosy could be “introduced”\r\nin any such way; and it is not easy to arrive at certitude, that all the\r\ncases of leprosy in princes and other high-placed personages (Baldwin IV.\r\nof Jerusalem who died at the age of twenty-five,[154] Robert the Bruce of\r\nScotland,[155] and Henry IV. of England[156]) were cases that would now be\r\ndiagnosed leprous.\r\n\r\nInstances may be quoted to show that the name of leper was flung about\r\nsomewhat at random. Thus, in an edict issued by Henry II., during the\r\nabsence of Becket abroad for the settlement of his quarrel with the king,\r\nit was decreed that anyone who brought into the country documents relating\r\nto the threatened papal interdict should have his feet cut off if he were\r\na regular cleric, his eyes put out if a secular clerk, should be hanged if\r\na layman, and be burned if a _leprosus_--that is to say, a beggar or\r\ncommon tramp. Again, in the charges brought for Henry III. against the\r\npowerful minister Hubert de Burg in 1239, one item is that he had\r\nprevented the marriage of our lord the king with a certain noble lady by\r\nrepresenting to the latter and to her guardian that the king was “a\r\nsquinter, and a fool, and a good-for-nothing, and that he had a kind of\r\nleprosy, and was a deceiver, and a perjurer, and more of a craven than any\r\nwoman[157]” etc.\r\n\r\nThere is also a curious instance of the term leprous being applied to the\r\nScots, evidently in the sense in which William of Malmesbury, and many\r\nmore after him, twitted that nation with their cutaneous infirmities. When\r\nthe Black Death of 1348-9 had reached the northern counties of England,\r\nthe Scots took advantage of their prostrate state to gather in the forest\r\nof Selkirk for an invasion, exulting in the “foul death of England.”\r\nKnighton says that the plague reached them there, that five thousand of\r\nthem died, and that their rout was completed by the English falling upon\r\nthem[158]. But the other contemporary chronicler of the Black Death,\r\nGeoffrey le Baker[159], tells the story with a curious difference. The\r\nScots, he says, swearing by the foul death of the English, passed from the\r\nextreme of exultation to that of grief; the sword of God’s wrath was\r\nlifted from the English and fell in its fury upon the Scots, “et [Scotos]\r\nper lepram, nec minus quam Anglicos per apostemata et pustulos, mactavit.”\r\nThe _apostemata_ and _pustuli_ were indeed the buboes, boils and\r\ncarbuncles of the plague, correctly named; but what was the _lepra_ of the\r\nScots? It was probably a vague term of abuse; but, if the clerk of Osney\r\nattached any meaning to it, it is clear that he saw nothing improbable in\r\na disease called _lepra_ springing up suddenly and spreading among a body\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that _lepra_ was a term used in a generic sense because\r\nof a real uncertainty of diagnosis, or because there was some advantage to\r\nbe got from being called _leprosus_, or because it was flung about at\r\nrandom. But there is still another reason for the inexact use of the terms\r\n_lepra_ and _leprosus_ in the medieval period, namely, the dominant\r\ninfluence of religious tradition. The heritage or accretion of religious\r\nsentiment not only perverted the correct use of the name, but led to\r\nregulations and proscriptions which were out of place even for the real\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biblical Associations of Leprosy.\r\n\r\nAmong the synonyms for _leprosi_ we find the terms “pauperes Christi,\r\nvidelicet Lazares,” the name of “Christ’s poor” being given to lepers by\r\nAelred in the twelfth century and by Matthew Paris in the thirteenth. The\r\nassociation of ideas with Lazarus is a good sample of the want of\r\ndiscrimination in all that pertains to medieval leprosy. The Lazarus of St\r\nLuke’s Gospel, who was laid at the rich man’s gate full of sores, is a\r\nrepresentative person, existing only in parable. On the other hand, the\r\nLazarus of St John’s Gospel, Lazarus of Bethany, the brother of Martha and\r\nMary, the man of many friends, is both a historical personage and a saint\r\nin the calendar. But there is nothing to show that he was a leper. He had\r\na remarkable experience of restoration to the light of day, and it was\r\nprobably on account of an episode in his life that made so much talk that\r\nhe received posthumously the name of Lazarus, or “helped of God[160].” The\r\nname of the man in the parable is also generic, just as generic as that\r\nof his contrast Dives is; but specifically there was nothing in common\r\nbetween the one Lazarus and the other. Yet St Lazarus specially named as\r\nthe brother of Martha and Mary (as in the charter of the leper-house at\r\nSherburn) became the patron of lepers. The ascription to Lazarus of\r\nBethany of the malady of Lazarus in the parable has done much for the\r\nprestige of the latter’s disease; in the medieval world it brought all\r\npersons full of sores within a nimbus of sanctity, as being in a special\r\nsense “pauperes Christi,” the successors at once of him whom Jesus loved\r\nand of “Lazarus ulcerosus.” Doubtless the lepers deserved all the charity\r\nthat they got; but we shall not easily understand the interest\r\nexceptionally taken in them, amidst abounding suffering and wretchedness\r\nin other forms, unless we keep in mind that they somehow came to be\r\nregarded as Christ’s poor.\r\n\r\nNext to the image of Lazarus, or rather the composite image of the two\r\nLazaruses, the picture of leprosy that filled the imagination was that of\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of Leviticus. That picture is even\r\nmore composite than the other, and for leprosy in the strict sense it is\r\nabsolutely misleading. The word translated “leprosy” is a generic term for\r\nvarious communicable maladies, most of which were curable within a\r\ndefinite period, sometimes no longer than a week. It rested with the skill\r\nof the priesthood to discriminate between the forms of communicable\r\ndisease, and to prescribe the appropriate ceremonial treatment for each;\r\nthe people had one common name for them all, and beyond that they were in\r\nthe hands of their priests, who knew quite well what they were about. The\r\nChristian Church dealt with all those archaic institutions of an Eastern\r\npeople in a child-like spirit of verbal or literal interpretation,\r\ndoubtless finding the greater part of them a meaningless jargon. But some\r\nverses would touch the imagination and call up a real and vivid picture,\r\nsuch verses, for example, as the following:\r\n\r\n    “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and\r\n    his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and\r\n    shall cry, Unclean, unclean. All the days wherein the plague shall be\r\n    in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean; he shall dwell alone;\r\n    without the camp shall his habitation be.”\r\n\r\nEven in that comparatively plain direction, the obvious suggestion that\r\nthe unclean person would not always be unclean, and that there was a term\r\nto his stay outside the camp, would go for little in reading the\r\nscripture. The medieval religious world took those parts of the Jewish\r\nteaching that appealed to their apprehension, and applied them to the\r\ncircumstances of their own time with as much of zeal as the common sense\r\nof the community would permit. We have clear evidence of the effect of the\r\nLevitical teaching about “leprosy” upon English practice in the ordinances\r\nof the St Albans leper hospital of St Julian, which will be given in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medieval Religious Sentiment towards Lepers.\r\n\r\nSeveral incidents told of lepers by the chroniclers bring out that\r\nexaggerated religious view of the disease. Roger of Howden has preserved\r\nthe following mythical story of Edward the Confessor. Proceeding one day\r\nfrom his palace to the Abbey Church in pomp and state, he passed with his\r\ntrain of nobles and ecclesiastics through a street in which sat a leper\r\nfull of sores. The courtiers were about to drive the wretched man out from\r\nthe royal presence, when the king ordered them to let him sit where he\r\nwas. The leper, waxing bold after this concession, addressed the king, “I\r\nadjure thee by the living God to take me on thy shoulders and bring me\r\ninto the church;” whereupon the king bowed his head and took the leper\r\nupon his shoulders. And as the king went, he prayed that God would give\r\nhealth to the leper; and his prayer was heard, and the leper was made\r\nwhole from that very hour, praising and glorifying God[161].\r\n\r\nIt is not the miraculous ending of this incident that need surprise us\r\nmost; for the Royal touch by which the Confessor wrought his numerous\r\ncures of the blind and the halt and the scrofulous, continued to be\r\nexercised, with unabated virtue, down to the eighteenth century, and came\r\nat length to be supervised by Court surgeons who were fellows of the Royal\r\nSociety. It is the humility of a crowned head in the presence of a leper\r\nthat marks an old-world kind of religious sentiment. The nearest approach\r\nto it in our time is the feet-washing of the poor by the empress at Vienna\r\non Corpus Christi day.\r\n\r\nA similar story, with a truer touch of nature in it, is told of Matilda,\r\nqueen of Henry I.; and it happens to be related on so good authority that\r\nwe may believe every word of it. Matilda was a Saxon princess, daughter of\r\nMargaret the Atheling, the queen of Malcolm Canmore. The other actor in\r\nthe story was her brother David, afterwards king of Scots and, like his\r\nmother, honoured as a saint of the Church. The narrator is Aelred, abbot\r\nof Rievaulx, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, celebrated for his Latin\r\nstyle and his care for Saxon history. The abbot was a friend of St David,\r\nwhose virtues he celebrates at length; the incident of queen Matilda and\r\nthe lepers was one that he often heard from David’s own lips (quod ex ore\r\nsaepe Davidis regis audivi). The princess Matilda, taking more after her\r\nmother than her father, had been brought up in an English convent under\r\nher aunt, the abbess of it. When it came to a marriage between her and\r\nHenry I., an alliance which was meant to reconcile the Saxons to Norman\r\nrule, the question arose in the mind of Anselm whether the princess\r\nMatilda had not actually taken the veil, and whether he could legally\r\nmarry her to the king. Questioned as to the fact, the princess made answer\r\nthat she had indeed worn the veil in public, but only as a protection from\r\nthe licentious insolence of the Norman nobles. She had no liking for the\r\ngreat match arranged for her, and consented unwillingly although the king\r\nwas enamoured of her. Such was her humility that Aelred designates her\r\n“the Esther of our times.” The marriage was on the 15th of November, 1100;\r\nand in the next year, according to the usual date given, the young queen\r\nsought relief and effusion for her religious instincts by founding the\r\nleper hospital of St Giles in the Fields, “with a chapel and a sufficient\r\nedifice.” Matthew Paris, a century and a half after, saw it standing as\r\nqueen Matilda had built it, and made a sketch of it in colours on the\r\nmargin of his page, still remaining to us in a library at Cambridge, with\r\nthe description, “Memoriale Matild. Regine.”\r\n\r\nThe story which her brother David told to the abbot of Rievaulx is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    When he was serving as a youth at the English Court, one evening he\r\n    was with his companions in his lodging, when the queen called him into\r\n    her chamber. He found the place full of lepers, and the queen standing\r\n    in the midst, with her robe laid aside and a towel girt round her.\r\n    Having filled a basin with water, she proceeded to wash the feet of\r\n    the lepers and to wipe them with the towel, and then taking them in\r\n    both her hands, she kissed them with devotion. To whom her brother:\r\n    “What dost thou, my lady? Certes if the king were to know this, never\r\n    would he deign to kiss with his lips that mouth of thine polluted with\r\n    the soil of leprous feet.” But she answered with a smile: “Who does\r\n    not know that the feet of an Eternal King are to be preferred to the\r\n    lips of a mortal king? See, then, dearest brother, wherefore I have\r\n    called thee, that thou mayest learn by my example to do so also. Take\r\n    the basin, and do what thou hast seen me do.” “At this,” said David,\r\n    narrating to the abbot, “I was sore afraid, and answered that I could\r\n    on no account endure it. For as yet I did not know the Lord, nor had\r\n    His Spirit been revealed to me. And as she proceeded with her task, I\r\n    laughed--_mea culpa_--and returned to my comrades[162].”\r\n\r\nThe example of his sister, however, was not lost upon him; for when he\r\nacquired the earldom and manor of Huntingdon, and so became an opulent\r\nEnglish noble, he founded a leper-hospital there. Aelred sees him in\r\nAbraham’s bosom with Lazarus.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of all this devotion to lepers is shown in the name which\r\nAelred applies to them--_pauperes Christi_. In washing their feet the\r\npious Matilda was in effect washing the feet of an Eternal King; and that,\r\nin her estimation, was better than kissing the lips of a mortal king.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Life of St Hugh of Lincoln we see the good bishop moved to\r\ntreat the leprous poor with a sort of attention which they can hardly have\r\nneeded or expected, merely because they were, as his biographer says, the\r\nsuccessors of _Lazarus ulcerosus_, and the special _protegés_ of Jesus.\r\nNot a few, says the biographer, were kept in seclusion owing to that\r\ndisease, both men and women. Bishop Hugh would take up his abode among\r\nthem and speak to them words of good cheer, promising them the flowers of\r\nParadise and an immortal crown. Having sent the women lepers out of the\r\nway, he would go round among the men to kiss them, and when he came to one\r\nwho was more atrociously marked by the disease than another, he would hold\r\nhim in a longer and more gracious embrace. It was too much for the\r\nbishop’s biographer: “Spare, good Jesus, the unhappy soul of him who\r\nrelates these things”--horrified, as he says he was, at seeing the\r\n“swollen and livid faces, deformed and sanious, with the eyelids everted,\r\nthe eyeballs dug out, and the lips wasted away, faces which it were\r\nimpossible to touch close or even to behold afar off[163]”. But these\r\nhorrible disfigurements of the face are by no means the distinctive marks\r\nof leprosy. The dragging down of the eyelids is an effect of leprosy but\r\nas likely to happen in lupus or rodent ulcer. The loss of the eyeball may\r\nbe a leprous sign, or perhaps from tumour. The wasting of the lips is a\r\ncharacteristic feature of lupus, after it has scarred, or if there be an\r\nactual loss of substance, of epithelial cancer; in leprosy, on the other\r\nhand, the lips, as well as other prominent folds of the face, undergo\r\nthickening, and will probably remain thickened to the end. The sufferers\r\nwho excited the compassion of St Hugh must have merited it; only they were\r\nnot all lepers, nor probably the majority of them[164].\r\n\r\nTwo leper-stories are told to the honour of St Francis of Assisi. Seeing\r\none day a friar of his order named James the Simple, consorting on the way\r\nto church with a leper from the hospital under his care, St Francis\r\nrebuked the friar for allowing the leper to be at large. While he thus\r\nadmonished the friar, he thought that he observed the leper to blush, and\r\nwas stricken with a sudden remorse that he should have said anything to\r\nhurt the wretched man’s feelings. Having confessed and taken counsel, he\r\nresolved, by way of penance, to sit beside the leper at table and to eat\r\nwith him out of the same dish, a penance all the greater, says the\r\nbiographer, that the leper was covered all over with offensive sores and\r\nthat the blood and sanies trickled down his fingers as he dipped them in\r\nthe dish. The other story is a more pleasing one. There was a certain\r\nleper among those cared for by the friars, who would appear from the\r\ndescription of him to have been one of the class of truculent impostors,\r\nmade all the worse by the morbid consideration with which his disease, or\r\nsupposed disease, was regarded. One of his complaints was that no one\r\nwould wash him; whereupon St Francis, having ordered a friar to bring a\r\nbasin of perfumed water, proceeded to wash the leper with his own\r\nhands[165].\r\n\r\nThese four tales, all of them told of saints except that of Matilda--she\r\nsomehow missed being canonised along with her mother St Margaret and her\r\nbrother St David--will serve to show what a halo of morbid exaggeration\r\nsurrounded the idea of leprosy in the medieval religious mind. We live in\r\na time of saner and better-proportioned sentiment; but the critical\r\nspirit, which has set so much else in a sober light, has spared the\r\nmedieval tradition of leprosy. Not only so, but our more graphic writers\r\nhave put that disease into the medieval foreground as if it had been the\r\ncommonest affliction of the time. We are taught to see the figures of\r\nlepers in their grey or russet gowns flitting everywhere through the\r\nscene; the air of those remote times is as if filled with the dull\r\ncreaking of St Lazarus’s rattle. Our business here is to apply to the\r\nquestion of leprosy in medieval Britain the same kind of scrutiny which\r\nhas been applied to the question of famines and famine-fevers, and remains\r\nto be applied next in order to the great question of plague--the kind of\r\nscrutiny which no historian would be excused from if his business were\r\nwith politics, or campaigns, or economics, or manners and customs. The\r\nbest available evidence for our purpose is the history of the\r\nleper-houses, to which we shall now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Leper-houses.\r\n\r\nThe English charitable foundations, or hospitals of all kinds previous to\r\nthe dissolution of the monasteries, including almshouses, infirmaries,\r\nMaisons Dieu and lazar-houses, amount to five hundred and nine in the\r\nindex of Bishop Tanner’s _Notitia Monastica_. In the 1830 edition of the\r\n_Monasticon Anglicanum_, the latest recension of those immense volumes of\r\nantiquarian research, there are one hundred and four such foundations\r\ngiven, for which the original charters, or confirming charters, or reports\r\nof inquisitions, are known; and, besides these, there are about three\r\nhundred and sixty given in the section on “Additional Hospitals,” the\r\nexistence and circumstances of which rest upon such evidence as casual\r\nmention in old documents, or entries in monastery annals, or surviving\r\nnames and traditions of the locality. Our task is to discover, if we can,\r\nwhat share of this charitable provision in medieval England, embracing at\r\nleast four hundred and sixty houses, was intended for the class of\r\n_leprosi_; what indications there are of the sort of patients reckoned\r\n_leprosi_; how many sick inmates the leper-houses had, absolutely as well\r\nas in proportion to their clerical staff; and how far those refuges were\r\nin request among the people, either from a natural desire to find a refuge\r\nor from the social pressure upon them to keep themselves out of the way.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the endowed hospitals of medieval England were in no\r\nexclusive sense leper-hospitals, but a general provision, under religious\r\ndiscipline, for the infirm and sick poor, for infirm and ailing monks and\r\nclergy, and here or there for decayed gentlefolk. The earliest of them\r\nthat is known, St Peter’s and St Leonard’s hospital at York, founded in\r\n936 by king Athelstane, and enlarged more especially on its religious side\r\nby king Stephen, was a great establishment for the relief of the poor,\r\nwith no reference to leprosy; it provided for no fewer than two hundred\r\nand six bedesmen, and was served by a master, thirteen brethren, four\r\nseculars, eight sisters, thirty choristers and six servitors. When\r\nLanfranc, the first Norman archbishop of Canterbury, set about organising\r\nthe charitable relief of his see in 1084, he endowed two hospitals, one\r\nfor the sick and infirm poor in general, and the other for _leprosi_[166].\r\nThe former, St John Baptist’s hospital, was at the north gate, a\r\ncommodious house of stone, for poor, infirm, lame or blind men and women.\r\nThe latter was the hospital of Herbaldown, an erection of timber, in the\r\nwoods of Blean about a mile from the west gate, for persons _regia\r\nvaletudine fluentibus_ (?), who are styled _leprosi_ in a confirming\r\ncharter of Henry II.[167] The charge of both these houses was given to the\r\nnew priory of St Gregory, over against St John Baptist’s hospital, endowed\r\nwith tithes for secular clergy. The leper-house at Herbaldown was divided\r\nbetween men and women; but in a later reign (Henry II.) a hospital\r\nentirely for women (twenty-five leprous sisters) was founded at\r\nTannington, outside Canterbury, with a master, prioress and three priests.\r\nThere was still a third hospital at Canterbury, St Lawrence’s, founded\r\nabout 1137, for the relief of leprous monks or for the poor parents and\r\nrelations of the monks of St Augustine’s.\r\n\r\nLondon had two endowed leper-hospitals under ecclesiastical government, as\r\nwell as certain spitals or refuges of comparatively late date. The\r\nhospital and chapel of St Giles in the Fields was founded, as we have\r\nseen, by Matilda, queen of Henry I., in 1101, and was commonly known for\r\nlong after as Matilda’s hospital. It was built for forty _leprosi_, who\r\nmay or may not all have lived in it; and it was supported in part by the\r\nvoluntary contributions of the citizens collected by a proctor. Its staff\r\nwas at first exceptionally small for the number of patients,--a chaplain,\r\na clerk and a messenger; but as its endowments increased several other\r\nclerics and some matrons were added. By a king’s charter of 1208 (10th\r\nJohn), it was to receive sixty shillings annually. It is next heard of, in\r\nthe Rolls of Parliament, in connexion with a petition of 1314-15 (8 Ed.\r\nII.), by the terms of which, and of the reply to it, we can see that there\r\nwere then some lepers in the hospital but also patients of another kind.\r\nIt is mentioned by Wendover, under the year 1222, as the scene of a trial\r\nof strength between the citizens and the _comprovinciales extra urbem\r\npositos_[168]: at that date it stood well in the country, probably near to\r\nwhere the church of St Giles now stands at the end of old High Holborn.\r\nThe drawing of the hospital on the margin of Matthew Paris’s manuscript\r\nshows it as a house of stone, with a tower at the east end and a smaller\r\none over the west porch, and with a chapel and a hall, but probably no\r\ndormitories for forty lepers[169].\r\n\r\nThe other endowed leper-house of the metropolis was the hospital of St\r\nJames, in the fields beyond Westminster. It was of ancient date, and\r\nprovided for fourteen female patients, who came somehow to be called the\r\n_leprosae puellae_[170], although youth is by no means specially\r\nassociated with leprosy. This house grew rich, and supported eight\r\nbrethren for the religious services of the sixteen patients[171].\r\n\r\nIt is usual to enumerate five, and sometimes six, other leper-hospitals,\r\nin the outskirts of London--at Kingsland or Hackney, in Kent Street,\r\nSouthwark (the Lock), at Highgate, at Mile End, at Knightsbridge and at\r\nHammersmith. But the earliest of these were founded in the reign of Edward\r\nIII. (about 1346) at a time when the old ecclesiastical leper-houses were\r\nnearly empty of lepers. It would be misleading to include them among the\r\nmedieval leper-houses proper, and I shall refer to them in a later part of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nThe example of archbishop Lanfranc at Canterbury and of queen Matilda in\r\nLondon was soon followed by other founders and benefactors. The movement\r\nin favour of lepers--there was probably too real an occasion for it to\r\ncall it a craze--gained much from the appearance on the scene of the\r\nKnights of the Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem. Those knights were the\r\nmost sentimental of the orders of chivalry, and probably not more\r\nreputable than the Templars or the main body of the Hospitallers from\r\nwhich they branched off. If we may judge of them by modern instances, they\r\nwanted to do some great thing, and to do it in the most theatrical way,\r\nwith everybody looking on. What real services they may have rendered to\r\nthe sick poor, leprous or other, there is little to show. The\r\nhead-quarters of the order were at Jerusalem, the Grand Master and the\r\nKnights there being all _leprosi_--doubtless in a liberal sense of the\r\nterm. We should be doing them no injustice if we take them to have been\r\nCrusaders so badly hit by their vices or their misfortunes as to be marked\r\noff into a separate order by a natural line. However, many others enlisted\r\nunder the banner of St Lazarus who were not _leprosi_; these established\r\nthemselves in various countries of Europe, acquired many manors and built\r\nfine houses[172]. In England their chief house was at Burton in\r\nLeicestershire; it was not by any means a great leper-hospital, but a\r\nCommandery or Preceptory for eight whole knights, with some provision for\r\nan uncertain number of poor brethren--the real Lazaruses who, like their\r\nprototype, would receive the crumbs from the high table. The house of\r\nBurton Lazars gradually swallowed up the lands of leper-hospitals\r\nelsewhere, as these passed into desuetude, and at the valuation of Henry\r\nVIII. it headed the list with an annual rental of £250. Their\r\nestablishment in England dates from the early part of the twelfth century,\r\nand although the house at Burton appears to have been their only\r\nconsiderable possession, they are said, on vague evidence, to have\r\nenlisted many knights from England, and, curiously enough, still more from\r\nScotland. A letter is extant by the celebrated schoolman, John of\r\nSalisbury, afterwards bishop of Chartres, written in the reign of Henry\r\nII. to a bishop of Salisbury, from which it would appear that the “Fratres\r\nHospitales” were regarded with jealousy and dislike by the clerical\r\nprofession; “rapiunt ut distribuant,” says the writer, as if there were\r\nsomething at once forced and forcible in their charities[173].\r\n\r\nCoincidently with the appearance in England of the Knights of St Lazarus,\r\nwe find the monasteries, and sometimes private benefactors among the\r\nnobility, beginning to make provision for lepers, either along with other\r\ndeserving poor or in houses apart. After the hospitals at Canterbury and\r\nLondon (as well as an eleventh-century foundation at Northampton, which\r\nmay or may not have been originally destined for _leprosi_), come the two\r\nleper-houses founded by the great abbey of St Albans. As these were\r\nprobably as good instances as can be found, their history is worth\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nIn the time of abbot Gregory (1119 to 1146), the hospital and church of St\r\nJulian was built on the London road, for six poor brethren (_Lazares_ or\r\n_pauperes Christi_) governed by a master and four chaplains. The\r\nmastership of St Julian’s is twice mentioned in the abbey chronicles as a\r\nvaluable piece of preferment. In 1254 the lands of the hospital were so\r\nheavily taxed, for the king and the pope, that the _miselli_, according to\r\nMatthew Paris, had barely the necessaries of life. But a century after,\r\nin 1350, the revenues were too large for its needs, and new statutes were\r\nmade; the accommodation of its six beds was by no means in request, the\r\nnumber of inmates being never more than three, sometimes only two, and\r\noccasionally only one[174]. The fate of the other leper-house of St Albans\r\nabbey, that of St Mary de Pratis for women, is not less instructive. The\r\ndate of its foundation is not known, but in 1254 it had a church and a\r\nhospital occupied by _misellae_[175]. A century later we hear of the house\r\nbeing shared between illiterate sisters and nuns. The former are not\r\ncalled lepers, but simply poor sisters; whatever they were, the nuns and\r\nthey did not get on comfortably together, and the abbot restored harmony\r\nby turning the hospital into a nunnery pure and simple[176]. Similar was\r\nthe history of one of the richest foundations of the kind, that of Mayden\r\nBradley in Wiltshire. It was originally endowed shortly before or shortly\r\nafter the accession of Henry II. (1135) by a noble family for an unstated\r\nnumber of poor women, generally assumed to have been _leprosae_, and for\r\nan unstated number of regular and secular clerics to perform the religious\r\noffices and manage the property. It had not existed long, however, when\r\nthe bishop of Salisbury, in 1190, got the charter altered so as to assign\r\nthe revenues to eight canons and--poor sisters, and so it continued until\r\nthe valuation of Henry VIII., when it was found to be of considerable\r\nwealth. In like manner the hospital of St James, at Tannington near\r\nCanterbury, founded in the reign of Henry II. for twenty-five “leprous\r\nsisters,” was found, in the reign of Edward III. (1344), to contain no\r\nlepers, its “corrodies” being much sought after by needy gentlewomen[177].\r\n\r\nAnother foundation of Henry II.’s reign was the leper-hospital of St Mary\r\nMagdalen at Sponne, outside the walls of Coventry. It was founded by an\r\nEarl of Chester, who, having a certain leprous knight in his household,\r\ngave in pure alms for the health of his soul and the souls of his\r\nancestors his chapel at Sponne with the site thereof, and half a carucate\r\nof land for the maintenance of such lepers as should happen to be in the\r\ntown of Coventry. There was one priest to celebrate, and with him were\r\nwont to be also certain brethren or sisters together with the lepers,\r\npraying to God for the good estate of all their benefactors. “But clear it\r\nis,” says Dugdale, “that the monks shortly after appropriated it to their\r\nown use.” However, they were in time dispossessed by the Crown, to which\r\nthe hospital belonged until the 14th of Edward IV[178].\r\n\r\nOne of the most typical as well as earliest foundations was the hospital\r\nof the Holy Innocents at Lincoln, endowed by Henry I. We owe our knowledge\r\nof its charter to an inquisition of Edward III. It was intended for ten\r\n_leprosi_, who were to be of the outcasts (_de ejectibus_) of the city of\r\nLincoln, the presentation to be in the king’s gift or in that of the mayor\r\nor other good men of the city, and the administration of it by a master or\r\nwarden, two chaplains and one clerk. In the space of two centuries from\r\nits foundation the character of its inmates had gradually changed. Edward\r\nIII.’s commissioners found nine poor brethren or sisters in it; only one\r\nof them was _leprosus_, and he had obtained admission by a golden key;\r\nalso the seven poor women had got in _per viam pecuniam_. In Henry VI.’s\r\ntime provision was made for the possibility of lepers still requiring its\r\nshelter--_quod absit_, as the new charter said.\r\n\r\nIn the same reign (end of Henry I.) the hospital of St Peter was founded\r\nat Bury St Edmunds by abbot Anselm, for priests and others when they grew\r\nold and infirm, leprous or diseased. The other hospital at Bury, St\r\nSaviour’s, had no explicit reference to leprosy at all. It was founded by\r\nthe famous abbot Samson about 1184, for a warden, twelve chaplain-priests,\r\nsix clerks, twelve poor gentlemen, and twelve poor women. About a hundred\r\nyears later the poor sisters had to go, in order to make room for old and\r\ninfirm priests.\r\n\r\nSometime before his death in 1139, Thurstan, archbishop of York, founded a\r\nhospital at Ripon for the relief of “all the lepers in Richmondshire;” the\r\nprovision was for eighteen patients, a chaplain and sisters. At an\r\nuncertain date afterwards the house was found to contain a master, two or\r\nthree chaplains and some brethren, who are not styled _leprosi_; and from\r\nthe inquisition of Edward III. we learn that its original destination had\r\nbeen for the relief as much of the poor as the leprous (_tam pauperum quam\r\nleprosorum_), and that there was no leprous person in it at the date of\r\nthe inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe mixed character of hospitals commonly reckoned leper-hospitals is\r\nshown by several other instances. St Mary Magdalene’s at Lynn (1145)\r\nprovided for a prior and twelve brethren or sisters, nine of whom were to\r\nbe whole and three leprous. St Leonard’s at Lancaster (time of king John)\r\nwas endowed for a master, a chaplain, and nine poor persons, three of them\r\nto be leprous. St Bartholomew’s at Oxford provided for a master, a clerk,\r\ntwo whole brethren and six infirm or leprous brethren; but the infirm or\r\nleprous brethren had all been changed into whole brethren by the time of\r\nEdward III[179]. So again the Normans’ spital at Norwich was found to be\r\nsheltering “seven whole sisters and seven half-sisters.”\r\n\r\nThe leper-hospital at Stourbridge, near Cambridge, was founded for lepers\r\nby king John, the one king in English history who cared greatly about his\r\nleprous subjects. It was committed to the charge of the burgesses of\r\nCambridge, but it was shortly after seized by Hugo de Norwold, bishop of\r\nEly, and within little more than fifty years from its foundation (7 Ed.\r\nI.) it was found that the bishop of Ely of that day was using it for some\r\npurposes of his own, but “was keeping no lepers in it, as he ought, and as\r\nthe custom had been[180].”\r\n\r\nThe ostentatious patronage of lepers by king John, of which something more\r\nmight be said, was preceded by a more important interposition on their\r\nbehalf by the third Council of the Lateran in 1179 (Alexander III.). The\r\nposition of _leprosi_ in the community had clearly become anomalous, and\r\none of the decrees of the Council was directed to setting it right.\r\nLepers, who were “unable to live with sound persons, or to attend church\r\nwith them, or to get buried in the same churchyard, or to have the\r\nministrations of the proper priest,” were enjoined to have their own\r\npresbytery, church, and churchyard, and their lands were to be exempt from\r\ntithe[181]. Within two or three years of that decree, in or near 1181, we\r\nfind a bishop of Durham, Hugh de Puiset, endowing the greatest of all the\r\nEnglish leper-hospitals, at Sherburn, a mile or more outside the city of\r\nDurham. The bishop was a noted instance of the worldly ecclesiastic of his\r\ntime. He was accused by the king of misappropriating money left by the\r\narchbishop of York, and his defence was that he had spent it on the blind,\r\nthe deaf, the dumb, the leprous, and such like deserving objects[182].\r\nWilliam of Newburgh has left us his opinion of the bishop’s charity: it\r\nwas a noble hospital lavishly provided for, “but with largess not quite\r\nhonestly come by” (_sed tamen ex parte minus honesta largitione_[183]).\r\nThe hospital of bishop Hugh, dedicated to the Saviour, the Blessed Virgin,\r\nSt Lazarus, and his sisters Mary and Martha, still exists as Christ’s\r\nHospital, a quadrangular building enclosing about an acre in a sunny\r\nvalley to the south of the city, with a fine chapel, a great hall (of\r\nwhich the ancient raftered roof existed into the present century), a\r\nmaster’s lodge, and a low range of buildings on the west side of the\r\nsquare for the poor brethren, with their own modest hall in the middle of\r\nit. The original foundation was certainly on a princely scale, as things\r\nthen went: it was for five “convents” of lepers, including in all\r\nsixty-five persons of both sexes, with a steward or guardian to be their\r\nown proper representative or protector, three priests, four attendant\r\nclerks, and a prior and prioress. We hear nothing more of the hospital for\r\na century and a half, during which time it had doubtless been filled by a\r\nsuccession of poor brethren, or sick poor brethren, but whether leprous\r\nbrethren, or even mainly leprous, may well be doubted after the recorded\r\nexperiences of Ripon, Lincoln and Stourbridge. Its charter was confirmed\r\nby bishop Kellaw about 1311-1316; and in an ordinance of 1349 we still\r\nread, but not without a feeling of something forced and unreal, of the\r\nhospital ministering to the hunger, the thirst, the nakedness of the\r\nleprous, and to the other wants and miseries by which they are incessantly\r\nafflicted. But within ninety years of that time (1434) the real state of\r\nthe case becomes apparent; the poor brethren had been neglected, and the\r\nestates so mismanaged or alienated to other uses, that new statutes were\r\nmade reducing the number of inmates to thirteen poor brethren and two\r\nlepers, the latter being thrown in, “if they can be found in these parts,”\r\nin order to preserve the memory of the original foundation[184].\r\n\r\nTo these samples, which are also the chief instances of English\r\nleper-hospitals, may be added two or three more to bring out another side\r\nof the matter. In the cases already given, it has been seen that the\r\nprovision for the clerical staff was either a very liberal one at first or\r\nbecame so in course of time. The hospitals, whether leprous or other, were\r\nfor the most part dependencies of the abbeys, affording occupation and\r\nresidence to so many more monks, just as if they had been “cells” of the\r\nabbey. The enormous disproportion of the clerical staff to the inmates of\r\nhospitals (not, however, leprous) is seen in the instances of St Giles’s\r\nat Norwich, St Saviour’s at Bury and St Cross at Winchester. The provision\r\nwas about six for the poor and half-a-dozen for the monks. But even the\r\npurely nosocomial part of these charities was in not a few instances for\r\nthe immediate relief of the monasteries themselves. St Bartholomew’s at\r\nChatham, one of the earliest foundations usually counted among the\r\nleper-hospitals, was for sick or infirm monks. The hospital at\r\nBasingstoke, endowed by Merton College, Oxford, was for incurably sick\r\nfellows and scholars of Merton itself. The leper-hospital at Ilford in\r\nEssex was founded about 1180 by the rich abbey of Barking, for the leprous\r\ntenants and servants of the abbey, the provision being for a secular\r\nmaster, a leprous master, thirteen leprous brethren, two chaplains and a\r\nclerk. St Lawrence’s at Canterbury (1137) was for leprous monks or for the\r\npoor parents and relations of monks. St Peter’s at Bury St Edmunds,\r\nfounded by abbot Anselm in the reign of Henry I., was for priests and\r\nothers when they grew old, infirm, leprous, or diseased.\r\n\r\nThe instances which have been detailed in the last few pages, perhaps not\r\nwithout risk of tediousness, have not been chosen to give a colour to the\r\nview of medieval leprosy; they are a fair sample of the whole, and they\r\ninclude nearly all those leper-hospitals of which the charters or other\r\nauthentic records are known[185]. It is possible by using every verbal\r\nreference to leprosy that may be found in connexion with all the five\r\nhundred or more medieval English hospitals in Bishop Tanner’s _Notitia\r\nMonastica_ or in Dugdale’s _Monasticon_, to make out a list of over a\r\nhundred leper-hospitals of one kind or another. But there are probably not\r\nthirty of them for which the special destination of the charity is known\r\nfrom charters or inquisitions; and even these, as we have seen, were not\r\nall purely for lepers or even mainly for lepers. As to the rest of the\r\nlist of one hundred, the connexion with leprosy is of the vaguest kind.\r\nThus, four out of the five hospitals in Cornwall are called lazar-houses\r\nor leper-hospitals, but they were so called merely on the authority of\r\nantiquaries subsequent to the sixteenth century. The same criticism\r\napplies almost equally to the eight so-called leper-hospitals, out of a\r\ntotal of fourteen medieval hospitals of all kinds, in Devonshire. It is\r\nclear that “lazar-house” became an even more widely generic term than the\r\nterms _lepra_ and _leprosus_ themselves[186].\r\n\r\nThus our doubts as to the amount of true leprosy that once existed in\r\nEngland, and was provided for in the access of chivalrous sentiment that\r\ncame upon Christendom in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, tend to\r\nmultiply in a compound ratio. We doubt whether many of the so-called\r\nleper-houses or lazar-houses in the list of one hundred, more or less,\r\nthat may be compiled from the _Monasticon_, were not ordinary refuges for\r\nthe sick and infirm poor, like the three or four hundred other religious\r\ncharities of the country. We know that, in some instances of\r\nleper-hospitals with authentic charters, the provision for the leprous was\r\nin the proportion of one to three or four of non-leprous inmates. We know\r\nthat as early as the end of the thirteenth century the _leprosi_ were\r\ndisappearing or getting displaced even from hospitals where the intentions\r\nof the founder were explicit. And lastly we doubt the homogeneity of the\r\ndisease called _lepra_ and of the class called _leprosi_.\r\n\r\nAs to the foundations of a later age they were no longer under\r\necclesiastical management, and they seem to have been mostly rude shelters\r\non the outskirts of the larger towns. In 1316 a burgess of Rochester, who\r\nhad sat in Parliament, left a house in Eastgate to be called St\r\nKatharine’s Spital, “for poor men of the city, leprous or otherwise\r\ndiseased, impotent and poor”--or, in other words, a common almshouse. The\r\nremarkable ordinance of Edward III. in 1346, for the expulsion of lepers\r\nfrom London, seems to have been the occasion of the founding of two\r\nso-called lazar-houses, one in Kent Street, Southwark, called “the\r\nLoke[187],” and the other at Hackney or Kingsland. These are the only two\r\nmentioned in the subsequent orders to the porters of the City Gates in\r\n1375; and as late as the reign of Henry VI. they are the only two, besides\r\nthe ancient Matilda’s Hospital in St Giles’s Fields, to which bequests\r\nwere made in the will of Ralph Holland, merchant taylor[188]. Another of\r\nthe suburban leper-spitals was founded at Highgate by a citizen in\r\n1468[189], and it is not until the reign of Henry VIII. that we hear of\r\nthe spitals at Mile End, Knightsbridge and Hammersmith[190]. By that time\r\nleprosy had ceased to be heard of in England; but another disease,\r\nsyphilis, had become exceedingly common; and it is known that those\r\nspitals, together with the older leper-hospitals, were used for the poorer\r\nvictims of that disease. Stow is unable to give the exact date of any of\r\nthese foundations except that at Highgate. He assumes that the others were\r\nall built on the occasion of the ordinance of 20 Edward III.; but it is\r\nprobable that only two of them, the Lock and the Kingsland or Hackney\r\nspital were built at that time[191].\r\n\r\nAn early instance of a leper-spital or refuge apparently without\r\necclesiastical discipline is mentioned in a charter roll of 1207-8, in\r\nwhich king John grants to the leprosi of Bristol a croft outside the\r\nLaffard gate, whereon to reside under the king’s protection and to beg\r\nwith impunity. On the roads leading to Norwich there were four such\r\nshelters, outside the gates of St Mary Magdalene, St Bennet, St Giles and\r\nSt Stephen respectively; these houses were each under a keeper, and were\r\nsupported by the alms of the townsfolk or of travellers; only one of the\r\nfour is alleged to have had a chapel attached. The date of these is\r\nunknown, but they were probably late. On the roads leading from Lynn,\r\nthere were three such erections, at Cowgate, Letchhythe and West Lynn,\r\nwhich are first mentioned in a will of 1432. These non-religious and\r\nunendowed leper-spitals were probably rude erections on the outskirts of\r\nthe town, at the door of which, or on the roadside near, one or more\r\nlepers would sit and beg. The liberty of soliciting alms was one of their\r\nprivileges, only they were not allowed to carry their importunity too far;\r\nhence the ordinance of most countries that the lepers were not to enter\r\nmills and bake-houses; and hence some ordinances of the Scots parliament\r\nlimiting the excursions of the leper folk. One of the most considerable\r\nprivileges to lepers was granted to the lepers of Shrewsbury in 1204 by\r\nking John, who did not lose the chance of earning a cheap reputation for\r\nChristian charity by his ostentatious patronage of the _pauperes Christi_:\r\nthey were entitled to take a handful of corn or flour from all sacks\r\nexposed in Shrewsbury market.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeper-houses in Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nMost of the leper-spitals of Scotland would appear to have been of the\r\npoorest kind, unendowed and unprovided with priests. The richest\r\nfoundation for lepers in Scotland was at Kingcase, near Prestwick in\r\nAyrshire, endowed with lands and consisting of a hospital of eight beds.\r\nOne or more leper-hospitals were built by the rich abbeys on the Tweed (at\r\nAldcambus in Berwickshire and probably at another place). Another great\r\necclesiastical centre in Scotland, Elgin, had a leper-house at Rothfan,\r\nwith accommodation for seven lepers, a chaplain, and a servant. After\r\nthese, the Scots leper-houses may be taken to have been mere refuges, in\r\nwhich the lepers supported themselves by begging. One such secular\r\nhospital was in the Gorbals of Glasgow, founded in 1350. Liberton, near\r\nEdinburgh, is supposed to mean Leper-town, and to have been a resort of\r\nthe sick on account of its medicinal spring. The hospital at Greenside,\r\nthen outside Edinburgh, was built in 1589. There was a leper-spital\r\noutside the Gallow-gate of Aberdeen, on a road which still bears the name\r\nof the Spital. Similar shelters may be inferred to have existed at Perth,\r\nStirling, Linlithgow and other places. James IV., in his journeys, used to\r\ndistribute small sums to the sick folk in the “grandgore” (syphilis), to\r\nthe poor folk, and to the lipper-folk, “at the town end[192].”\r\n\r\nThere were some leper-hospitals in Ireland, but it is not easy to\r\ndistinguish them in every case from general hospitals for the sick poor.\r\nThus the hospital built by the monks of Innisfallen in 869 is merely\r\ncalled _nosocomium_, although it is usually reckoned an early foundation\r\nfor lepers in Ireland. A hospital at Waterford was “confirmed to the poor”\r\nby the Benedictines in 1185. St Stephen’s in Dublin (1344) is specially\r\nnamed as the residence of the “poor lepers of the city” in a deed of gift\r\nabout 1360-70; a locality of the city called Leper-hill was perhaps the\r\nsite of another refuge. Lepers also may have been the occupants of the\r\nhospitals at Kilbrixy in Westmeath (St Bridget’s), of St Mary Magdalene’s\r\nat Wexford (previous to 1408), of the house at “Hospital,” Lismore (1467),\r\nat Downpatrick, at Kilclief in county Down, at Cloyne, and of one or more\r\nof four old hospitals in or near Cork. The hospital at Galway, built “for\r\nthe poor of the town” about 1543, was not a leper-house, nor is there\r\nreason to take the old hospital at Dungarvan as a foundation specially for\r\nlepers[193].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prejudice against Lepers.\r\n\r\nIt will have been inferred, from many particulars given, that the\r\nsegregation of lepers in the Middle Ages was far from complete, and that\r\nmany ministered to them without fear and without risk. The same hospital\r\nreceived both _leprosi_ and others, the hospitals were served by staffs of\r\nchaplains, clerks and sometimes women attendants; and yet nothing is\r\nanywhere said of contagion being feared or of the disease spreading by\r\ncontagion. The experience of these medieval hospitals was doubtless the\r\nsame as in the West Indies and other parts of the world in our own day.\r\nIt is true that the medical writers pronounce the disease to be\r\ncontagious, _ut docet Avicenna_; but the public would seem to have been\r\nunaware of that, and they certainly lost nothing by their ignorance of the\r\nmedical dogma, which, in the text-books, is merely the result of a\r\nconcatenation of verbalist arguments. At the same time it is clear that\r\nthere was a certain amount of segregation of the leprous. The inmates of\r\nthe hospital at Lincoln are significantly described as “de ejectibus” of\r\nthe city. The third Lateran Council based one of its decrees upon what\r\nmust have been a common experience, namely, that lepers were unable to mix\r\nfreely with others, and that they were objected to in the same church, and\r\neven as corpses in the same churchyard. There are some particular\r\nindications of that feeling to be gathered from the chroniclers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable histories is that of a high ecclesiastic in the\r\npre-Norman period. In the year 1044, Aelfward, bishop of London, being\r\nstricken with leprosy (_lepra perfusus_) sought an asylum in the monastery\r\nof Evesham, of which he was the prior. The monks may have had more than\r\none reason for not welcoming back their prior; at all events they declined\r\nto let him stay, so that he repaired to the abbey of Ramsey, where he had\r\npassed his noviciate and been shorn a monk. He carried off with him from\r\nEvesham certain valuables and relics; and his old comrades at Ramsey,\r\nundeterred by his leprosy or counter-attracted by his treasures, took him\r\nin and kept him until his death. The incident can hardly be legendary for\r\nit is related in the annals of Ramsey Abbey by one who wrote within a\r\nhundred years of the event[194].\r\n\r\nAnother case, which may also be accepted as authentic, is given by Eadmer\r\nin his _Life of Anselm_. Among the penitents who sought counsel and\r\nconsolation of Anselm while he was still abbot of Bec in Normandy, with a\r\ngreat name for sanctity, was a certain powerful noble from the marches of\r\nFlanders. He had been stricken with leprosy in his body, and his grief was\r\nall the greater that he saw himself despised beneath his hereditary rank,\r\nand shunned by his peers _pro obscenitate tanti mali_[195].\r\n\r\nBesides such notable cases, we find more evidence in the ordinances of the\r\nhospital of St Julian at St Albans, which have been preserved more\r\ncompletely than those of any other leper-house. Forasmuch as the disease\r\nof leprosy is of all infirmities held the most in contempt, the\r\nunfortunate person who is about to be received into the St Albans house is\r\ndirected to work himself up into a state of the most factitious\r\nmelancholy; he is reminded, not only of the passage in Leviticus about\r\n“Unclean, unclean!”, but also of the blessed Job, who was himself a leper\r\n(in the 14th century his boils became identified with the plague, and in\r\nthe end of the 15th century the patriarch was claimed as an early victim\r\nof the _lues venerea_); and further of the verse in the 53rd of Isaiah:\r\n“Et nos putavimus eum leprosum, percussum a Deo, et humiliatum[196].” The\r\nSt Albans house, with its six beds, appears to have been carefully\r\nmanaged, and its inmates well provided for; but the unreal atmosphere of\r\nthe place had been too much for the leprous or other patients of the\r\ndistrict; for we find it on record that they could hardly be persuaded to\r\ndon its russet uniform, and submit themselves for the rest of their lives\r\nto its discipline.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question, then, that persons adjudged leprous were\r\nshunned, driven out or ostracised by public opinion, and even legislated\r\nagainst. The reality of these practices should not be confounded with a\r\nreal need for them. Least of all should they be ascribed to a general\r\nbelief in the contagiousness of the disease. In practice no one heeded the\r\nmedical dogma of leprous contagion, because no one attached any concrete\r\nmeaning to it or had any real experience of it. There was prejudice\r\nagainst lepers, partly on account of Biblical tradition, and partly\r\nbecause the “terribilis aspectus” of a leper was repulsive or uncanny.\r\nFurther, in genuine leprosy, the most wretched part of the victim’s\r\ncondition was not his appearance (which in a large proportion of cases\r\nmay present little that is noticeable to passing observation), but his\r\nunfitness for exertion, his listlessness, and depression of spirits, owing\r\nto the profound disorganisation of his nerves. A leprous member of a\r\nfamily would be a real burden to his relatives; and in a hard and cruel\r\nage he would be little better off than the stricken deer of the herd or\r\nthe winged bird of the flock. To become a beggar was his natural fate; and\r\nas a beggar he became privileged, by royal patent or by prescription,\r\nwhile beggars in ordinary were under a ban.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubted that the privilege of begging accorded to lepers was\r\nabused, and was claimed by numbers who feigned to be lepers[197]. The one\r\nsevere edict against lepers in England was the ordinance of Edward III.\r\nfor the exclusion of lepers from London in 1346; it is clear, however,\r\nfrom the text of the ordinance that the occasion of it was not any fixed\r\npersuasion of the need for isolating leprous subjects, but some\r\nintolerable behaviour of lepers or of those who passed as such. The mayor\r\nand sheriffs are ordered to procure that all lepers should avoid the city\r\nwithin fifteen days, for the reason that persons of that class, as well by\r\nthe pollution of their breath, etc. “as by carnal intercourse with women\r\nin stews and other secret places, detestably frequenting the same, do so\r\ntaint persons who are sound, both male and female, to the great injury\r\netc.[198]” That is the old confusion which we have already noticed in\r\nBernard Gordonio and Gilbert; it is an edict against _lepra_ in its\r\ngeneric sense, and against the same class that William Clowes\r\ncharacterizes so forcibly in his book on the _morbus Gallicus_ in 1579. At\r\na date intermediate between those two, in 1488, an order was made by the\r\nprovost of Paris, that “lepers” should leave the city; but that is too\r\nlate a date for leprosy, although not too early for syphilis. On the 24th\r\nAugust, 1375, the porters of the City Gates were sworn to prevent lepers\r\nfrom entering the city, or from staying in the same, or in the suburbs\r\nthereof; and on the same date, the foreman at ‘Le Loke’ (the Lock Hospital\r\nin Southwark) and the foreman at the leper-spital of Hackney took oath\r\nthat they will not bring lepers, or know of their being brought, into the\r\ncity, but that they will inform the said porters and prevent the said\r\nlepers from entering, so far as they may[199].\r\n\r\nWhen all word of leprosy had long ceased in England the porters of the\r\nCity Gates had the same duties towards beggars in general. Thus in\r\nBullein’s _Dialogue_ of 1564, the action begins with a whining beggar from\r\nNorthumberland saying the Lord’s Prayer at the door of a citizen. The\r\ncitizen asks him, “How got you in at the gates?” whereupon it appears that\r\nthe Northumbrian had a friend at Court: “I have many countrymen in the\r\ncity,” among the rest an influential personage, the Beadle of the\r\nBeggars[200].\r\n\r\nWhile it cannot be maintained that lepers were tolerated or looked upon\r\nwith indifference, yet it was for other reasons than fear of contagion\r\nthat they were objectionable. The prejudices against them have been\r\nalready illustrated from periods as early as the eleventh century. They\r\nwere, to say the least, undesirable companions, and in certain occupations\r\nthey must have been peculiarly objectionable. Thus, on the 11th June,\r\n1372, in the city of London, John Mayn, baker, who had often times before\r\nbeen commanded by the mayor and aldermen to depart from the city, and\r\nprovide for himself some dwelling without the same, and avoid the common\r\nconversation of mankind, seeing that he the same John was smitten with the\r\nblemish of leprosy--was again ordered to depart[201]. It does not appear\r\nwhether the baker departed that time, nor is there any good diagnosis of\r\nhis leprosy; there was certainly a prejudice against him, but the occasion\r\nof it may have been nothing more than the eczematous crusts on the hands\r\nand arms, sometimes very inveterate, which men of his trade are subject\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIt is clear also from a singular case in the _Foedera_, that a false\r\naccusation of leprosy was sometimes brought against an individual, perhaps\r\nout of enmity, like an accusation of witchcraft. In 1468 a woman accused\r\nof leprosy appealed to Edward IV., who issued a chancery warrant for her\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n    The writ of 3rd July, 1468, is to the king’s physicians, “sworn to the\r\n    safe-keeping of our person,” William Hatteclyff, Roger Marschall, and\r\n    Dominic de Serego, doctors of Arts and Medicine; and the subject of\r\n    the inquisition is Johanna Nightyngale of Brentwood in Essex, who was\r\n    presumed by certain of her neighbours to be infected by the foul\r\n    contagion of _lepra_, and for whose removal from the common\r\n    intercourse of men a petition had been laid in Chancery. She had\r\n    refused to remove herself to a solitary place, _prout moris est_; the\r\n    physicians are accordingly ordered to associate with themselves\r\n    certain legal persons, to inquire whether the woman was leprous, and,\r\n    if so, to have her removed to a solitary place _honestiori modo quo\r\n    poteris_. On the 1st of November, 1468, the court of inquiry reported\r\n    that they found the woman to be in no way leprous, nor to have been.\r\n    The woman had been brought before them: they had passed in review\r\n    twenty-five or more of the commonly reputed signs of _lepra_, but they\r\n    had not found that she could be convicted of leprosy from them, or\r\n    from a sufficient number of them; again, passing in review each of the\r\n    four species of lepra (_alopecia_, _tinia_, _leonina_, and\r\n    _elephantia_) and the forty or more distinctive signs of the species\r\n    of _lepra_, they found not that the woman was marked by any of the\r\n    species of _lepra_, but that she was altogether free and immune from\r\n    every species of _lepra_[202].\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws against Lepers.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance of 21 Edward III. (1346) against the harbouring of lepers in\r\nLondon is the only one of the kind (so far as I know) in English history;\r\nthe Statutes of the realm contain no reference to lepers or leprosy from\r\nfirst to last; the references in the Rolls of Parliament are to the taxing\r\nof their houses and lands. The laws which deprived lepers of marital\r\nrights and of heirship appear to have been wholly foreign; in England,\r\nleprosy as a bar to succession was made a plea in the law courts. It\r\nappears, however, that a law against lepers was made by a Welsh king in\r\nthe tenth century[203]. It is not easy to realize the state of Welsh\r\nsociety in the tenth century; but we know enough of it in the twelfth\r\ncentury, from the description of Giraldus Cambrensis, to assert with some\r\nconfidence that “leprosy” might have meant anything--perhaps the “lepra\r\nNormannorum[204].”\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the laws and ordinances, civil and ecclesiastical, against\r\nlepers have been more numerous. In 1242 and 1269, canons of the Scots\r\nChurch were made, ordering that lepers should be separated from society in\r\naccordance with general custom. In 1283-84, the statutes of the Society of\r\nMerchants, or the Guildry, of Berwick provided that lepers should not\r\nenter the borough, and that “some gude man sall gather alms for them.” In\r\n1427 the Parliament of Perth authorised ministers and others to search the\r\nparishes for lepers[205].\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that little was made of leprosy by English legislators\r\n(rather more by the Scots), just as we have found that in the endowment of\r\ncharities, the leprous had only a small share, and that share a somewhat\r\nexaggerated one owing to the morbid sentimentality of the chivalrous\r\nperiod. The most liberal estimate of the amount of true leprosy at any\r\ntime in England would hardly place it so high as in the worst provinces of\r\nIndia at the present day. In the province of Burdwan, with a population of\r\nover two millions, which may be taken to have been nearly the population\r\nof England in the thirteenth century, there are enumerated 4604 lepers, or\r\n2·26 in every thousand inhabitants. But even with that excessive\r\nprevalence of leprosy, and with no seclusion of the lepers, a traveller\r\nmay visit the province of Burdwan, and not be aware that leprosy is\r\n“frightfully common” in it. In medieval England the village leper may have\r\nbeen about as common as the village fool; while in the larger towns or\r\ncities, such as London, Norwich, York, Bristol, and Lincoln, true lepers\r\ncan hardly have been so numerous as the friars themselves, who are\r\nsupposed to have found a large part of their occupation in ministering to\r\ntheir wants. A rigorous scepticism might be justified, by the absence of\r\nany good diagnostic evidence, in going farther than this. But the\r\nconvergence of probabilities does point to a real prevalence of leprosy in\r\nmedieval England; and those probabilities will be greatly strengthened by\r\ndiscovering in the then habits of English living a _vera causa_ for the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of Medieval Leprosy.\r\n\r\nWhat was there in the medieval manner of life to give rise to a certain\r\nnumber of cases of leprosy in all the countries of Europe? Granting that\r\nnot all who were called _leprosi_ and _leprosae_, were actually the\r\nsubjects of _lepra_ as correctly diagnosed, and that the misnomer was not\r\nunlikely to have been applied in the case of princes, nobles and great\r\necclesiastics, we have still to reckon with the apparition of leprosy\r\namong the people in medieval Europe and with its gradual extinction, an\r\nextinction that became absolute in most parts of Europe before the Modern\r\nperiod had begun.\r\n\r\nOf the “importation” of leprosy into Britain from some source outside\r\nthere can be no serious thought; the words are a meaningless phrase, which\r\nno one with a real knowledge of the conditions, nature and affinities of\r\nleprosy would care to resort to. The varying types of diseases, or their\r\nexistence at one time and absence at another, are a reflex of the\r\nvariations in the life of the people--in food and drink, wages, domestic\r\ncomfort, town life or country life, and the like. No one doubts that the\r\nbirth-rate and the death-rate have had great variations from time to time,\r\ndepending on the greater or less abundance of the means of subsistence, on\r\novercrowding, or other things; and the variation in the birth-rate and\r\ndeath-rate is only the most obvious and numerically precise of a whole\r\nseries of variations in vital phenomena, of which the successions,\r\nalternations, and novelties in the types of disease are the least simple,\r\nand least within the reach of mere notional apprehension or mere\r\nstatistical management. The apparition and vanishing of leprosy in\r\nmedieval Europe was one of those vital phenomena. It may be more easily\r\napprehended by placing beside it a simple example from our own times.\r\n\r\nThe pellagra of the North Italian peasantry (and of Roumania, Gascony and\r\nsome other limited areas) is the nearest affinity to leprosy among the\r\nspecies of disease. Strip leprosy of all its superficial and sentimental\r\ncharacters, analyse its essential phenomena, reduce its pathology to the\r\nmost correct outlines, and we shall find it a chronic constitutional\r\nmalady not far removed in type from pellagra. In both diseases there are\r\nthe early warnings in the excessive sensibility, excessive redness and\r\nchanges of colour, at certain spots of skin on or about the face or on the\r\nhands and feet. In both diseases, permanent loss of sensibility follows\r\nthe previous exaggeration, blanching of the skin will remain for good at\r\nthe spots where redness and discoloration were apt to come and go, and\r\nthese affections of the end-regions of nerves will settle, in less\r\ndefinite way, upon the nervous system at large,--the cerebro-spinal\r\nnervous system, or the organic nervous system, or both together. What\r\nmakes leprosy seem a disease in a different class from that, is the\r\nformation of nodules, or lumps, in the regions of affected skin in a\r\ncertain proportion of the cases. If leprosy were all anaesthetic leprosy,\r\nits affinities to pellagra would be more quickly perceived; it is because\r\nabout one-half of it has more or less of the tuberculated character that a\r\ndiversion is created towards another kind of pathology. But the fact that\r\nsome cases of leprosy develop nodules along the disordered nerves does not\r\nremove the disease as a whole from the class to which pellagra belongs. In\r\nboth diseases we are dealing essentially with a profound disorder of the\r\nnerves and nerve-centres, commencing in local skin-affections which come\r\nand go and at length settle, proceeding to implicate the nervous functions\r\ngenerally, impairing the efficiency of the individual, and bringing him to\r\na miserable end. The two diseases diverge each along its own path, leprosy\r\nbecoming more a hopeless disorder of the nerves of tissue-nutrition, and\r\nso taking on a structural character mainly but not exclusively, and\r\npellagra becoming more a hopeless disorder of the organic nervous system\r\n(digestion, circulation, etc.) with implication of the higher nervous\r\nfunctions, such as the senses, the intellect, and the emotions, and so\r\ntaking on a functional character mainly but not exclusively. The\r\ncorrelation of structure and function is one that goes all through\r\npathology as well as biology; and here we find it giving character to each\r\nof two chronic disorders of the nervous system, according as the\r\nstructural side or the functional side comes uppermost.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the circumstances of pellagra, and do these throw light\r\nupon the medieval prevalence of leprosy? Pellagra has been proved with the\r\nhighest attainable scientific certainty to be due to a staple diet of\r\nbread or porridge made from damaged or spoilt maize. It followed the\r\nintroduction of maize into Lombardy at an interval of two or three\r\ngenerations, and its distribution corresponds closely to the poorer kinds\r\nof maize on colder soils, and to the class of the peasantry who get the\r\nworst kind of corn or meal for their food. The cases of the disease among\r\nthe peasantry of Lombardy and some other maize-growing provinces of\r\nNorthern Italy, were about one hundred thousand when last estimated; the\r\nendowed charitable houses and lunatic asylums are full of them. The\r\nconnexion of the disease with its causes is perfectly well understood; but\r\nthe economic questions of starvation wages, of truck, of large farms with\r\nbailiffs, and of agricultural usage, have proved too much for the chambers\r\nof commerce and the Government; so that there is as yet little or no sign\r\nof the decline of pellagra in the richest provinces of Italy. This disease\r\nis not mentioned in the Bible, therefore it has no traditional vogue; it\r\nis not well suited to knight-errantry, because it is a common evil of\r\nwhole provinces; its causes are economic and social, therefore there is no\r\nready favour to be earned by systematic attempts to deal with them; and\r\nthere is absolutely no opening for heroism and self-sacrifice of the more\r\nostentatious kind. These are among the reasons why this great\r\nobject-lesson of a chronic disorder of nutrition, proceeding steadily\r\nbefore our eyes, has been so little perceived. It is in pellagra, however,\r\nthat we find the key to the ancient problem of leprosy. The two diseases\r\nare closely allied in the insidious approach of their symptoms, in their\r\nimplicating the tissue-nutrition through the nerves, or the nervous\r\nfunctions through the nutrition, in their cumulating and incurable\r\ncharacter, and in their transmissibility by inheritance. Thus\r\nnosologically allied, they may be reasonably suspected of having analogous\r\ncauses; and as we know the cause of modern pellagra to be something\r\nnoxious in the habitual diet of the people, we may look for the cause of\r\nmedieval leprosy in something of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe dietetic cause is not far to seek, and it cannot be stated better than\r\nin the following well-known passage by the philosophical Gilbert White in\r\nhis _Natural History of Selborne_[206]:--\r\n\r\n    “It must, therefore, in these days be, to a humane and thinking\r\n    person, a matter of equal wonder and satisfaction, when he\r\n    contemplates how nearly this pest is eradicated, and observes that a\r\n    leper is now [1778] a rare sight. He will, moreover, when engaged in\r\n    such a train of thought, naturally inquire for the reason. This happy\r\n    change perhaps may have originated and been continued from the much\r\n    smaller quantity of salted meat and fish now eaten in these kingdoms;\r\n    from the use of linen next the skin; from the plenty of bread; and\r\n    from the profusion of fruits, roots, legumes, and greens, so common in\r\n    every family. Three or four centuries ago, before there were any\r\n    enclosures, sown-grasses, field-turnips, or field-carrots, or hay, all\r\n    the cattle which had grown fat in summer, and were not killed for\r\n    winter use, were turned out soon after Michaelmas to shift as they\r\n    could through the dead months; so that no fresh meat could be had in\r\n    winter or spring. Hence the marvellous account of vast stores of\r\n    salted flesh found in the larder of the eldest Spencer even so late in\r\n    the spring as the 3rd of May (600 bacons, 80 carcases of beef, and 600\r\n    muttons)[207]. It was from magazines like these that the turbulent\r\n    barons supported in idleness their riotous swarms of retainers, ready\r\n    for any disorder or mischief. But agriculture is now arrived at such\r\n    pitch of perfection, that our best and fattest meats are killed in the\r\n    winter; and no man needs eat salted flesh, unless he prefers it, that\r\n    has money to buy fresh.\r\n\r\n    “One cause of this distemper might be no doubt the quantity of\r\n    wretched fresh and salt fish consumed by the commonalty at all seasons\r\n    as well as in Lent, which our poor now would hardly be persuaded to\r\n    touch.... The plenty of good wheaten bread that now is found among all\r\n    ranks of people in the south, instead of that miserable sort which\r\n    used, in old days, to be made of barley or beans, may contribute not a\r\n    little to the sweetening their blood and correcting their juices.”\r\n\r\nLet us add to this, that the meat diet of the poorer class, whether serfs\r\nor freemen, would be apt to consist of the more worthless portions, the\r\nsemi-putrid pieces in the salted sides of bacon, mutton or beef, and that\r\nbadly-cured pork was in many parts the usual kind of flesh-food; and we\r\nshall have no difficulty in finding the noxious element in the diet of the\r\nMiddle Ages, which the dietetic hypothesis of leprosy requires. Some who\r\nhave advocated that hypothesis for modern leprosy, have laid themselves\r\nopen, notwithstanding the ability and industry of their research, to\r\nplausible objections which have no bearing if the hypothesis be\r\nsufficiently safe-guarded. Leprosy, like every other _morbus miseriae_,\r\nneeds a number of things working together to produce it, its more or less\r\nuniform specific character or distinctive mark being determined by the\r\npresence of one factor in particular. The special factor should be\r\ngeneralised as much as possible, so as to cover the whole circumstances of\r\nleprosy: it is not only half-cured or semi-putrid fish[208], but\r\nhalf-cured or semi-putrid flesh of any kind. The most general expression\r\nfor leprosy is a semi-putrid or toxic character of animal food, just as\r\nfor the allied pellagra, it is a semi-putrid or toxic character of the\r\nbread or porridge. Moreover it is that noxious or unnatural thing in the\r\nfood, not once and again, or as a _bonne bouche_, but somewhat steadily\r\nfrom day to day as a chief part of the sustenance, and from year to year.\r\nAs the rain-drops wear the stones, so the poison in the daily diet tells\r\nupon the constitution. Once more, such special causes may be present in a\r\ncountry generally, among the poor of all the towns, villages and hamlets,\r\nand yet only one person here and there may show specific effects that are\r\nrecognisable as a disease to which we give a name. Unless there be present\r\nthe aiding and abetting things, the special factor will hardly make itself\r\nfelt; and if there be not the special factor, there may be some other\r\n_morbus miseriae_ but there will not be that one. These aiding things are\r\nfor the most part the usual concomitants of poverty and hardships, wearing\r\nout the nerves far more than is commonly supposed and producing in\r\nordinary an excessive amount of nervous affections among the poor. But\r\namong the poor themselves, as well as among the well-to-do, there are\r\nspecial susceptibilities in individuals and in families. One person may\r\nhave the same unwholesome surroundings as another and the same poisonous\r\nelement in his diet, but he may fall into no such train of symptoms as his\r\nleprous neighbour because he is not formed in quite the same way, because\r\nhe has “no nerves,” or is of a hardier stock, or because his unwholesome\r\nmanner of life comes out in some other form of disease (scrofula perhaps,\r\nless probably gout), or for some other reason deeply hidden in his\r\nancestry and his personal peculiarities. The chances would be always\r\nlargely against that particular combination of factors needed to make\r\nleprosy. It was a _morbus miseriae_ of the Middle Ages, but on the whole\r\nnot a very common one; and it was easily shaken off by the national life\r\nwhen the conditions changed ever so little. It was all the more easily\r\nshaken off by reason of the facilities for divorce, the prohibition of\r\nmarriage, and the monastic discipline.\r\n\r\nThe staple diet as a cause of leprosy was suspected in the Middle Ages,\r\nand by writers as ancient as Galen. It is not without significance that\r\nthe minute directions for the dieting of the lepers in the rich hospital\r\nof Sherburn, near Durham, urge special caution as to the freshness of the\r\nfish: when fresh fish was not to be had, red herrings might be\r\nsubstituted, but only if they were well cured, not putrid nor corrupt.\r\nThose directions were in accordance with the best medical teaching of the\r\ntime on the dietetics of leprosy, or on how to prevent leprosy, as it is\r\ngiven with considerable minuteness in Gordonio and Gilbert[209].\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we find a singular ordinance of the Scots Parliament at\r\nScone in 1386, or some forty years after the date of the Durham\r\nregulations: “Gif ony man brings to the market corrupt swine or salmond to\r\nbe sauld, they sall be taken by the Bailie and incontinent without ony\r\nquestion sall be sent to the lepper-folke; and gif there be na\r\nlepper-folke, they sall be destroyed alluterlie[210].” Nothing could be\r\nmore significant for the prevalence and persistence of leprosy in\r\nScotland[211]. Putrid fish and pork did actually come to market; the\r\ndangers of them as regarded the production of leprosy were unsuspected;\r\nand the lepers (genuine or mistaken) were actually directed to be fed with\r\nthem. Such food for “lepers” could only have fed the disease; and if it be\r\nthe case that genuine leprosy was met with in Edinburgh and Glasgow more\r\nthan two centuries after it ceased to be heard of in England, we need be\r\nat no loss to assign the reason why the disease was more inveterate in the\r\none country than in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most likely of the fourteenth-century English annalists to have given\r\nus a good account of the Black Death was the historian Ranulphus Higden,\r\nauthor of the _Polychronicon_, who became a monk of St Werburgh’s abbey at\r\nChester about the beginning of the century, and lived to see the\r\ndisastrous year of 1349[212]. That part of his history which relates to\r\nhis own period he brings down year by year to 1348, with less fulness of\r\ndetail in the later years, as if old age were making him brief. Under the\r\nyear 1348 he begins the subject of the great mortality, speaks of the\r\nincessant rains of the second half of the year from Midsummer to\r\nChristmas, refers to the ravages of the plague at Avignon, the then\r\necclesiastical capital of Christendom, just mentions England and Ireland,\r\nand then lets the pen fall from his hand. Higden is believed to have\r\nresumed his annals after 1352; but he was then a very old man, and the\r\nlast entries are unimportant. But the period from 1348 to 1352 is an\r\nabsolute blank. He comes to the edge of the great subject of that time, as\r\nif he had intended to deal with it comprehensively, beginning with a\r\nnotice of the previous weather, which is by no means irrelevant, and after\r\ntwo or three lines more he breaks off. Most of the monastic chronicles are\r\ninterrupted at the same point; if there is an entry at all under the year\r\n1349 it is for the most part merely the words magna mortalitas. The\r\nprevailing sense of desolation and despair comes out in the record made by\r\na friar of Kilkenny, who kept a chronicle of passing events, and escaped\r\nthe fate of his brethren in the convent only long enough to record a few\r\nparticulars of the great mortality[213]:\r\n\r\n    “And I, friar John Clyn, of the Order of Friars Minor, and of the\r\n    convent of Kilkenny, wrote in this book those notable things which\r\n    happened in my time, which I saw with my eyes, or which I learned from\r\n    persons worthy of credit. And lest things worthy of remembrance should\r\n    perish with time, and fall away from the memory of those who are to\r\n    come after us, I, seeing these many evils, and the whole world lying,\r\n    as it were, in the wicked one, among the dead waiting for death till\r\n    it come--as I have truly heard and examined, so have I reduced these\r\n    things to writing; and lest the writing should perish with the writer,\r\n    and the work fail together with the workman, I leave parchment for\r\n    continuing the work, if haply any man survive, and any of the race of\r\n    Adam escape this pestilence and continue the work which I have\r\n    commenced.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the English chronicles so directly personal as that,\r\nbut there are some facts recorded of the mortality in four of them which\r\nhave contemporary value, or almost contemporary. The best of these\r\naccounts, as a piece of history, is that of Henry Knighton, canon of\r\nLeicester[214], who acknowledges his indebtedness to Higden’s\r\n_Polychronicon_ for the events down to 1326, but after that date either\r\nwrites from his own observation or takes his facts from some unknown\r\ncontemporary source. The next in importance is Geoffrey le Baker[215], a\r\nclerk of the abbey of Osney, near Oxford, whose account of the arrival of\r\nthe Black Death in England has obtained wide currency as copied literally\r\nin the 1605 edition of Stow’s _Annals_. The third is Robert de\r\nAvesbury[216], whose _History of Edward III._ serves as a chronicle for\r\nthe city of London more particularly. The fourth is the Malmesbury monk\r\nwho wrote, about 1367, the chronicle known as the _Eulogium_[217].\r\n\r\nFrom the systematic paragraphs of those writers, and from various other\r\nincidental notices, an outline of the progress of the pestilence in\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland, may be traced. It entered English soil at a\r\nport of Dorsetshire--said in the _Eulogium_ to have been Melcombe\r\n(Weymouth)--in the beginning of August, 1348. It is said to have spread\r\nrapidly through Dorset, Devon and Somerset, almost stripping those\r\ncounties of their inhabitants, and to have reached Bristol by the 15th of\r\nAugust. The people of Gloucester in vain tried to keep out the infection\r\nby cutting off all intercourse with Bristol; from Gloucester it came to\r\nOxford, and from Oxford to London, reaching the capital at Michaelmas,\r\naccording to one account, or at All Saints (1st November) according to\r\nanother. Although the 15th of August is definitely given as the date of\r\nits arrival at Bristol from the Dorset coast, it must not be assumed that\r\nthe infection covered the ground so quickly as that in the rest of its\r\nprogresses. We have a measure of the rate of its advance south-westward\r\nthrough Devonshire to Cornwall, in a contemporary entry in the register of\r\nthe Church of Friars Minor at Bodmin[218]: confirming the independent\r\nstatements that the pestilence entered England at the beginning of August,\r\nthe register goes on to record that it reached the town of Bodmin shortly\r\nbefore Christmas, and that there died in that town about fifteen hundred\r\npersons, as estimated.\r\n\r\nThe corporation records of Bridport, a town near to the place in Dorset\r\nwhere the infection landed, show that four bailiffs held office, instead\r\nof two, in the 23rd of Edward III., _in tempore pestilentiae_; the 23rd of\r\nEdward III. would begin 25 Jan. 1349, but the municipal year would\r\nprobably have extended from September 1348, so that Bridport may have had\r\nthe infection before the end of that year[219]. It seems probable that the\r\nsmaller towns, and the villages, all over the South-west, had been\r\ninfected in the end of 1348, but somewhat later than Bristol and\r\nGloucester. The mandate of Ralph, bishop of Bath and Wells, “On\r\nconfessions in the time of the pestilence,” is dated Wynchelcomb, 4. id.\r\nJan. M.CCC.XLVIII. (10 January, 1349) and it speaks of the contagion\r\nspreading everywhere, and of many parish churches and other cures in his\r\ndiocese being left without curate and priest to visit the sick and\r\nadminister the sacraments[220].\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1348 may be taken, then, as correct for the South-west; and\r\nthere is no doubt that the infection had been severe enough in London\r\nbefore the end of that year to move the authorities to action.\r\n\r\n“Owing to the increasing severity of the sudden plague day by day at\r\nWestminster and places adjoining,” Parliament was prorogued on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1349[221]. There was a further prorogation on the 10th of March,\r\nfor the reason given that “the pestilence was continuing at Westminster,\r\nin the city of London, and in other places, more severely than before”\r\n(_gravius solito_)[222]. This agrees with Avesbury’s statement that the\r\nepidemic in London reached a height (_in tantum excrevit_) after\r\nCandlemas, 1349, and that it was over about Pentecost. One of the best\r\nproofs of the season and duration of the Black Death in London is got from\r\nthe number of wills enrolled in the Husting Court of the city in the\r\nsuccessive months. Those who died of the plague leaving wills were, of\r\ncourse, but a small fraction of the whole mortality; but the wills during\r\nsome eight months of 1349 are ten or fifteen times more numerous than in\r\nany other year before or after, excepting perhaps the year of the _pestis\r\nsecunda_, 1361. Starting from 3 in November, 1348 (none in December), the\r\nprobates rise to 18 in January, 1349, 42 in February, 41 in March, none in\r\nApril (owing to paralysis of business, doubtless), but 121 in May, 31 in\r\nJune, 51 in July, none in August and September, 18 in October, 27 in\r\nNovember, and then an ordinary average[223]. Thus it would have had a\r\nduration of some seven or eight months in the capital, with a curve of\r\nincrease, maximum intensity, and decrease, just as the great London\r\nepidemics of the same disease in the 16th and 17th centuries are known\r\nfrom the weekly bills to have had.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to have been felt at all in Norwich and other places in\r\nthe Eastern Counties until the end of March, 1349, its enormous ravages in\r\nthat part of England falling mostly in the summer. There is a definite\r\nstatement that it began at York about the feast of the Ascension, by which\r\ntime it had almost ceased in London, and that it lasted in the capital of\r\nthe northern province until the end of July. The infection almost emptied\r\nthe abbey of Meaux, in Holdernesse, of its monks, and the abbey lands of\r\ntheir tenants; and the date given in the abbey chronicle is the month of\r\nAugust, 1349. The spring and summer of that year appear to have been the\r\nseasons of the great mortality all over England, excepting perhaps in the\r\nsouthern counties where the outbreak began; even at Oxford, which is one\r\nof the towns mentioned as on the route of the pestilence from Dorsetshire\r\nto London, the mortality is entered under the year 1349, which was also\r\nthe year of its enormous prevalence among the farmers and peasants on the\r\nmanor of Winslow, in the county of Bucks.\r\n\r\nIts invasion of the mountainous country of Wales (by no means exempt from\r\nplague in the 17th century) may have been a season later--_anno sequenti_,\r\nsays Le Baker, which may mean either 1349 or 1350. In the Irish annals,\r\nthe first mention of the pestilence is under the year 1348; but it was\r\nprobably only the rumour of the mortality at Avignon and elsewhere abroad\r\nthat caused the alarm in Ireland among ecclesiastics and in gatherings of\r\nthe people. It was first seen on the shores of Dublin Bay, at Howth and\r\nDalkey, and a little farther north on the coast at Drogheda; it raged in\r\nDublin “from the beginning of August until the Nativity[224],” which may\r\nmean the year 1348, although the year 1349 is the date given for the great\r\nmortality in Ireland in later chronicles.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Scotland illustrates still farther the slow progression\r\nof the plague, and its dependence to some extent upon the season of the\r\nyear. Two English chroniclers (Le Baker and Knighton) mention that it got\r\namong the Scots assembled in the forest of Selkirk for an invasion at the\r\ntime when the mortality was greatest in the northern counties, the autumn\r\nof 1349. But the winter cold must have held it in check as regards the\r\nrest of Scotland; for it is clear from Fordoun that its great season in\r\nthat country generally was the year 1350. Thus the Black Death may be said\r\nto have extended over three seasons in the British Islands--a partial\r\nseason in the south of England in 1348, a great season all over England,\r\nin Ireland and in the south of Scotland in 1349, and a late extension to\r\nScotland generally in 1350. The experience of all Europe was similar, the\r\nMediterranean provinces receiving the infection as early as 1347, and the\r\nnorthern countries, on the Baltic and North Seas, as late as 1350.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms and Type of the Black Death.\r\n\r\nThis sweeping pestilence was part of a great wave of infection which\r\npassed over Europe from the remote East, and of which we shall trace the\r\nantecedents in the latter part of this chapter. The type and symptoms of\r\nthe disease are sufficiently well-known from foreign descriptions--by Guy\r\nde Chauliac and Raymond de Chalin, both of Avignon, by Boccaccio, and by\r\nthe Villani of Florence. It was the bubo-plague, a disease which is known\r\nto have existed in Egypt in the time of the Ptolemies, and made its first\r\ngreat incursion from that country into Europe in the reign of Justinian in\r\nthe year 543 (see Chapter I.). Its second great invasion, but from a new\r\ndirection, was the Black Death of 1347-9; and from that time it remained\r\ndomesticated in the soil of Europe for more than three hundred years as\r\n“the plague.” The first medical descriptions of it by native British\r\nwriters are comparatively late. Manuscript treatises or “ordinances” on\r\nthe plague circulated in England from the reign of Richard II., most of\r\nthem being copies of a short work of no great value by one John of\r\nBurgoyne or John of Bordeaux. There is also extant an English translation\r\nin manuscript, assigned to the 14th century (but belonging to the end of\r\nit, if not to the 15th), of a really good work on the plague by the bishop\r\nof Aarhus, in Denmark, of which I shall have more to say in the next\r\nchapter. But none of these give English experience; and the earliest of\r\nour 16th century plague-books, by Phaer, is a compilation mostly, if not\r\nentirely, from the Danish bishop’s treatise, the latter having been\r\nprinted in its English form in or near 1480. It is not until we come to\r\nthe work of Dr Gilbert Skene of Edinburgh, printed in 1568, that we find a\r\ntreatise on plague showing traces of first-hand observation and\r\nreflection. Then follow the essay of Simon Kellwaye on the London plague\r\nof 1593, and that of the well-known Elizabethan poet and physician Thomas\r\nLodge, on the plague of 1603. Thus the reign of the plague in Britain was\r\napproaching an end before the native medical profession began to write\r\nupon it. Its eventful history from its arrival in 1348 down to a\r\ncomparatively late period has to be constructed from other materials than\r\nthe records or systematic writings of the faculty.\r\n\r\nThe type of the Black Death in England is sufficiently indicated by Le\r\nBaker, who was probably living at Osney, near Oxford, when the infection\r\nbegan, and indubitably by friar Clyn of Kilkenny. Le Baker mentions the\r\n_apostemata_ or swellings in diverse parts, their sudden eruption, and\r\ntheir extreme hardness and dryness, so that hardly any fluid escaped when\r\nthey were lanced according to the usual method of treating them[225]. He\r\nspeaks also of a peculiarly fatal form, from which few or none recovered;\r\nit was characterised by “small black pustules” on the skin, probably the\r\nlivid spots or “tokens” which came to be considered the peculiar mark of\r\nthe plague, and were certainly the index of a malignant type of it, just\r\nas the corresponding haemorrhages are in pestilential fever (or typhus)\r\nand in yellow fever. The disease, he adds, was swift in doing its work:\r\none day people were in high health and the next day dead and buried.\r\nKnighton also says, with special reference to Bristol, that the attack was\r\nfatal sometimes within twelve hours, and usually within three days at the\r\nmost. The treatment, which would have been, according to all subsequent\r\nexperience, the privilege only of those who could pay for it, would appear\r\nto have consisted in lancing the risings or botches in the armpits, neck,\r\nor groins; these were the lymph-glands enlarged to the size of a walnut or\r\nof a hen’s egg, and of a livid colour,--the most striking and certain of\r\nall the plague-signs.\r\n\r\nClyn’s account of the disease, as he saw it at Kilkenny in 1349, is\r\nimportant for including one remarkable symptom on which great importance\r\nhas been laid as distinctive of the Black Death among the epidemics of\r\nbubo-plague, namely haemorrhage from the lungs: “For many died from\r\ncarbuncles, and boils, and botches which grew on the legs and under the\r\narms; others from passion of the head, as if thrown into a frenzy; others\r\nby vomiting blood[226].” It was so contagious, he says, that those who\r\ntouched the dead, or even the sick, were incontinently infected that they\r\ndied, and both penitent and confessor were borne together to the same\r\ngrave. Such was the fear and horror of it that men scarce dared exercise\r\nthe offices of pity, namely, to visit the sick and bury the dead. Clyn’s\r\nlist of symptoms includes all the most prominent features of the plague as\r\nwe shall find them described for the great epidemics of the Stuart\r\nperiod--the botches in the armpits or groins, the carbuncles, the boils\r\n(or blains), and the frenzy or delirium, as well as the special symptom of\r\nthe great mortality--vomiting of blood.\r\n\r\nOf the botch, which was the most striking sign of the plague, the\r\nfollowing description, by Woodall (1639), may be introduced here, to\r\nsupplement the more meagre accounts of the bubo-plague on its first\r\nappearance. Woodall had himself suffered from the bubo or botch on two\r\noccasions, in its comparatively safe suppurating form; his description\r\nrelates to the hard, tense, and dry botch, especially mentioned by Le\r\nBaker for 1349, and always the index of great malignity:\r\n\r\n    “But the pestilential bubo or boyle commeth ever furiously on, and as\r\n    in a rage of a Feaver, and as being in haste; sometimes it lighteth on\r\n    or near the inguen thwart, but more often lower upon the thigh,\r\n    pointing downward with one end, the upper end towards the belly being\r\n    commonly the biggest or the fullest part of the bubo, the whole thigh\r\n    being also inflamed[227].”\r\n\r\nOf this disease, says Le Baker, few of the first rank died, but of the\r\ncommon people an incalculable number, and of the clergy and the cleric\r\nclass a multitude known to God only. It was mostly the young and strong\r\nwho were cut off, the aged and weakly being commonly spared. No one dared\r\ncome near the sick, and the bodies of the dead were shunned. Both Le Baker\r\nand Knighton speak of whole villages and hamlets left desolate, and of\r\nnumbers of houses, both great and small, left empty and falling to ruin.\r\nIt was not merely one in a house that died, says friar Clyn of Kilkenny,\r\nbut commonly husband, wife, children and domestics all went the same way\r\nof death; the friar himself wrote as one _inter mortuos mortem expectans_.\r\nWithout naming the locality, Avesbury says that in a single day, twenty,\r\nforty, sixty or more corpses were buried in the same trench[228]. The\r\nstereotyped phrase in the monastic chronicles is that not more than a\r\ntenth part of the people were left alive. However, the author of the\r\n_Eulogium_, a monk of Malmesbury who brought his history down to 1366,\r\ngives a numerical estimate at the other extreme. He says that the plague\r\nentered England at Melcumbe, destroyed innumerable people in Dorset, Devon\r\nand Somerset, and, having left few alive in Bristol, proceeded northwards,\r\nleaving no city, nor town, nor hamlet, nor scarcely a house, in which it\r\ndid not cut off the greater part of the people, or the whole of them; but\r\nhe adds, somewhat inconsequently, “so that a fifth part of the men, women\r\nand children in all England were consigned to the grave[229].” These are\r\nthe vague contemporary estimates of the mortality--ranging from\r\nnine-tenths to one-fifth of the whole population. It is possible, however,\r\nto come much nearer to precision by the systematic use of documents; and\r\nin that exercise we shall now proceed, in an order from the more general\r\nto the more particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates of the Mortality.\r\n\r\nThere are two State documents the language of which favours the more\r\nmoderate kind of estimate. In a letter of the king[230], dated 1 December,\r\n1349, or after the epidemic was over, to the mayor and bailiffs of\r\nSandwich, ordering them to watch all who took ship for foreign parts so as\r\nto arrest the exit of men and money, the preamble or motive is: “Quia non\r\nmodica pars populi regni nostri Angliae praesenti Pestilentia est\r\ndefuncta.” (Forasmuch as no mean part of the people of our kingdom of\r\nEngland is dead of the present pestilence.) The Statute of Labourers, 18\r\nNovember, 1350, begins: “Quia magna pars populi, et maximé operariorum et\r\nservientium jam in ultima pestilentia est defuncta.” (Forasmuch as a great\r\npart of the people, principally of artisans and labourers, is dead in the\r\nlate pestilence.) The statute would have emphasized the loss of artizans\r\nand labourers as these were its special subjects, but the _maximé\r\noperariorum et servientium_ may be fairly taken in a literal sense to mean\r\nthat the adult and able-bodied of the working class suffered most. One of\r\nthe contemporary chronicles says that the women and children were sent to\r\ntake the places of the men in field labour[231]. It is also significant\r\nthat the “second plague” of 1361 is named by two independent chroniclers\r\nthe _pestis puerorum_, or plague of the juveniles, as if it were now their\r\nturn. The _pestis secunda_ was also notable, both in England and on the\r\nContinent, for the numbers of the nobility which it carried off, and in\r\nthat respect it was contrasted with the Black Death.\r\n\r\nNext we come to certain numerical statements as to the mortality of 1349,\r\nwhich have an air of precision. They relate to Leicester, Oxford, Bodmin,\r\nNorwich, Yarmouth and London. In Leicester, according to Knighton, who was\r\na canon there at the time or shortly after, the burials from the Black\r\nDeath were more than 700 in St Margaret’s churchyard, more than 400 in\r\nHoly Cross parish (afterwards St Martin’s), more than 380 in St Leonard’s\r\nparish, which was a small one, and in the same proportion in the other\r\nparishes, which were three or four in number, and none of them so large as\r\nthe two first named. Knighton’s round numbers for three parishes are not\r\nimprobable, considering that Leicester was a comparatively populous town\r\nat the time of the poll-tax of 1377: the numbers who paid the tax were\r\n2101, which would give, by the usual way of reckoning, a population of\r\n3939. The population of the same three parishes in 1558, or shortly after\r\nthe period when English towns were described in the statute of 32 Henry\r\nVIII. as being much decayed, would have been about 820 in St Margaret’s,\r\n800 in St Martin’s (Holy Cross), and 160 in St Leonard’s[232]. In 1712,\r\nwhen the hosiery industry had been flourishing for thirty years, the\r\npopulation of St Margaret’s was about 1900 and of St Martin’s about 1750,\r\nthe estimated population of the whole town having been 6450, or about\r\none-half more than we may assume it to have been in 1349.\r\n\r\nIn order to realise what the pestilence of 1349 meant to these parishes of\r\nLeicester, let us take the actual burials from the parish register of one\r\nof them, St Martin’s, in the comparatively mild plague years of 1610 and\r\n1611, a period when the population, as calculated from the annual averages\r\nof births and deaths, would have been from 3000 to 3500, probably less,\r\ntherefore, by some hundreds than it was in the years before the Black\r\nDeath. In 1610 there were 82 burials in St Martin’s parish, or about twice\r\nthe average of non-plague years; in 1611 there were 128 burials, or three\r\nto four times the annual average[233]. Knighton’s 400 deaths for the same\r\nparish in 1349 would mean that the ordinary burials were multiplied about\r\nten times; while his figures for two other parishes would mean a still\r\ngreater ratio of increase[234].\r\n\r\nFor Oxford the estimate is not less precise or more moderate. “’Tis\r\nreported,” says Anthony Wood, under the year 1349, “that no less than\r\nsixteen bodies in one day were carried to one churchyard[235].”\r\n\r\nThe information for Bodmin, in Cornwall, comes from William of\r\nWorcester[236] who read it, about a century after the event, in the\r\nregister of the Franciscan church in that town. The entry in the register\r\nwas doubtless made at the time, and as made by Franciscans familiar with\r\nburials it deserves some credit for approximate accuracy. The deaths are\r\nput down in round numbers at fifteen hundred, which may seem large for\r\nBodmin at that date. But the truth is that the Cornish borough was a\r\nplace of relatively greater importance then than afterwards. In the king’s\r\nwrit of 1351, for men-at-arms, in which each town was rated on the old\r\nbasis before the Black Death, Bodmin comes fourteenth in order, being\r\nrated at eight men, while such towns as Gloucester, Hereford and\r\nShrewsbury are rated at ten each. It may well have had a population of\r\nthree or four thousand, of which the numbers said to have died in the\r\ngreat mortality would be less than one-half.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most satisfactory reckoning of the dead from contemporary\r\nstatements is that which can be made for London. The disease, as we know,\r\nreached the capital at Michaelmas or All Souls (1st November), and its\r\nprevalence led to a prorogation of Parliament on the 1st of January, and\r\nagain on the 10th of March, the reason assigned for the farther\r\nprorogation being that the pestilence was raging _gravius solito_--more\r\nseverely than usual. The winter mortality must have been considerable,\r\nalthough doubtless the season of the year kept it in check, as in all\r\nsubsequent experience. But there is evidence that three more\r\nburying-places became necessary early in the year 1349. One of these, of\r\nno great extent, was on the east side of the City, in the part that is now\r\nthe Minories[237]; and two were on the north side, not far apart. Of the\r\nlatter, one formerly called Nomansland, in West Smithfield, was also of\r\nsmall extent[238]; but the other was a field of thirteen acres and a rood,\r\nwhich became in the course of years the property of the Carthusians and\r\nthe site of the Charterhouse (partly covered now by Merchant Taylors\r\nSchool). The larger burial-ground, called Manny’s cemetery after its donor\r\nsir Walter Manny, the king’s minister and high admiral, was consecrated by\r\nthe bishop of London and opened for use at Candlemas, 1349. Now comes in\r\nthe testimony of Avesbury, the only chronicler of good authority for\r\nLondon in those years. The mortality increased so much, he says (_in\r\ntantum excrevit_), that there were buried in Manny’s cemetery from the\r\nfeast of the Purification (when it was opened) until Easter more than 200\r\nin a single day (_quasi diebus singulis_), besides the burials in other\r\ncemeteries[239]. The language of the chronicler implies that the burials\r\nin the new cemetery rose to a maximum of 200 in a day. The Black Death\r\nmust have been like the great London plagues of later times in this\r\nrespect, at least, that it rose to a height, remained at its highest level\r\nfor some two, three or four weeks, and gradually declined. A maximum of\r\n200 in a day, in the cemetery which would have at that stage received\r\nnearly all the dead, would mean a plague-mortality from first to last, or\r\nan epidemic curve, not unlike that of the London plague of 1563, for which\r\nwe have the exact weekly totals[240]: the five successive weeks at the\r\nheight of that plague (Sept. 3 to Oct. 8) produced mortalities of 1454,\r\n1626, 1372, 1828 and 1262; and the epidemic throughout its whole curve of\r\nintensity from June to December caused a mortality of 17,404. If\r\nAvesbury’s figures had been at all near the mark, the Black Death in\r\nLondon would have been a twenty-thousand plague, or to make a most liberal\r\nallowance for burials in other cemeteries than Manny’s when the epidemic\r\nwas at its worst, it might have been a thirty-thousand plague. Even at the\r\nsmaller of those estimates it would have been a much more severe\r\nvisitation upon the London of Edward III. than the plague with 17,404\r\ndeaths was upon the London of the 5th of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe mortality of London in the Black Death has been usually estimated at a\r\nfar higher figure than 20,000 or 30,000. There was a brass fixed to a\r\nstone monument in the Charterhouse churchyard (Manny’s cemetery), bearing\r\nan inscription which was read there both by Stow and Camden. Stow gives\r\nthe Latin words, of which the following is a translation: “Anno Domini\r\n1349, while the great pestilence was reigning, this cemetery was\r\nconsecrated, wherein, and within the walls of the present monastery, were\r\nburied more than fifty thousand bodies of the dead, besides many more from\r\nthat time to the present, on whose souls may God have mercy. Amen.” Camden\r\nsays the number on the brass was forty thousand, but his memory had\r\nprobably misled him[241]. This has been accepted as if trustworthy,\r\napparently because it was inscribed upon a monument in the cemetery; and\r\nit has been argued that if one cemetery received 50,000 corpses in the\r\nplague, the other cemeteries and parish churchyards of London would have\r\ntogether received as many more, so that the whole mortality of London\r\nwould have been 100,000[242].\r\n\r\nBut that mode of reckoning disregards alike the scrutiny of documents and\r\nthe probabilities of the case. The inscription bears upon it that it was\r\nwritten subsequent to the erection of the Carthusian monastery, which was\r\nnot begun until 1371[243]. The round estimate of 50,000 is at least\r\ntwenty-two years later than the mortality to which it relates, and may\r\neasily have been magnified by rumour in the course of transmission. Even\r\nif it had contemporary value we should have to take it as the roughest of\r\nguesses. The latter objection applies in a measure to Avesbury’s estimate\r\nof 200 burials in a day at the height of the epidemic; but clearly it is\r\neasier to count correctly up to 200 in a day than to 50,000 in the space\r\nof three or four months. On the ground of probability, also, the number of\r\n50,000 in one cemetery (or 100,000 for all London) is wholly incredible.\r\nThe evidence to be given in the sequel shows that the mortality was about\r\none-half the population. Assuming one-half as the death-rate, that would\r\nhave brought the whole population of London in the 23rd of Edward III. up\r\nto about 200,000--a number hardly exceeded at the accession of James I.,\r\nafter a great expansion which had proceeded visibly in the Elizabethan\r\nperiod under the eyes of citizens like John Stow, had crowded the\r\nhalf-occupied space between the City gates and the bars of the Liberties,\r\nand had overflowed into the out-parishes to such an extent that\r\nproclamations from the year 1580 onwards were thought necessary for its\r\nrestraint[244].\r\n\r\nHardly any details of the Black Death in London are known, but the few\r\npersonal facts that we have are significant. Thus, in the charter of\r\nincorporation of the Company of Cutlers, granted in 1344, eight persons\r\nare named as wardens, and these are stated in a note to have been all dead\r\nfive years after, that is to say, in the year of the Black Death, 1349,\r\nalthough their deaths are not set down to the plague[245]. Again, in the\r\narticles of the Hatters’ Company, which were drawn up only a year before\r\nthe plague began (Dec. 13, 1347), six persons are named as wardens, and\r\nthese according to a note of the time were all dead before the 7th of\r\nJuly, 1350[246], the cause of mortality being again unmentioned probably\r\nbecause it was familiar knowledge to those then living. It is known also\r\nthat four wardens of the Goldsmiths’ Company died in the year of the Black\r\nDeath. These instances show that the plague, on its first arrival, carried\r\noff many more of the richer class of citizens than it did in the\r\ndisastrous epidemics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The same\r\nis shown by the number of wills, already given. Perhaps the greatest of\r\nthe victims of plague in London was Bradwardine, “doctor profundus,” the\r\nnewly-appointed archbishop of Canterbury, who died at Lambeth, with the\r\nfatal botch in the armpits, on 26 Aug. 1349, just a week after landing at\r\nDover from Avignon.\r\n\r\nThe often-quoted figures for Norwich, 57,374 deaths in the city from the\r\npestilence of 1349, are wholly incredible. They are derived from an entry\r\nin the borough records in the Gildhall[247]: “In yis yere was swiche a\r\nDethe in Norwic that there died of ye Pestilence LVII Mil III C LXXIIII\r\nbesyd Relygius and Beggars.” We should probably come much nearer the truth\r\nby reading “XVII Mil.” for “LVII Mil.” It does not appear at what time the\r\nentry was made, nor by what computation the numbers were got. Norwich was\r\ncertainly smaller than London; in the king’s writ of 1351 for men-at-arms,\r\nLondon’s quota is 100, and that of Norwich 60; the next in order being\r\nBristol’s, 20, and Lynn’s, 20. These were probably the old proportions,\r\nfixed before the Black Death, and re-issued in 1351 without regard to what\r\nhad happened meanwhile, and they correspond on the whole to the number of\r\nparishes in each city (about 120 in London and 60 in Norwich[248]).\r\nNorwich may have had from 25,000 to 30,000 people before the pestilence,\r\nbut almost certainly not more. The city must have suffered terribly in\r\n1349, for we find, by the returns in the Subsidy Roll showing the amount\r\nraised by the poll-tax of 1377 and the numbers in each county and town on\r\nwhom it was levied, that only 3952 paid the tax in Norwich, whereas 23,314\r\npaid it in London[249]. That is a very different proportion from the 60 to\r\n100, as in the writ for men-at-arms; and the difference is the index of\r\nthe decline of Norwich down to the year 1377. In that year, the\r\npopulation, by the usual reckoning from the poll-tax, would have been\r\nabout 7410; and it is conceivable that at least twice that number had died\r\nof the plague within the city during the spring and summer of 1349.\r\n\r\nThe figures given of the mortality at Yarmouth, 7052, are those inscribed\r\nupon a document or a brass that once stood in the parish church; it was\r\nseen there in the fifteenth century by William of Worcester, a squire of\r\nthe Fastolf family connected with Yarmouth, who gives the numbers as 7000,\r\ngiving also the exact dimensions of the great church itself[250]. They are\r\nadduced by the burgesses of Yarmouth in a petition of 17 Henry VII.\r\n(1502), as follows: “Buried in the parish church and churchyard of the\r\nsaid town 7052 men.” Yarmouth, like Norwich, suffered unusually from the\r\nBlack Death; in 1377, by the poll-tax reckoning, its population was about\r\n3639. It may be assumed to have lost more than half its people; but it\r\nrecovered quickly, was made a seat of the wool-staple, and threatened to\r\nrival Norwich.\r\n\r\nClyn’s statement that 14,000 died in Dublin from the beginning of August\r\nuntil Christmas may also be taken merely as illustrating the inability of\r\nearly writers to count correctly up to large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe most trustworthy figures of mortality in the Black Death which were\r\nrecorded at the time are those given for the inmates of particular\r\nmonasteries; and these are such as to give colour to the remark\r\ninterpolated in Higden’s _Polychronicon_ that “in some houses of religion,\r\nof twenty there were left but twain.”\r\n\r\nAt St Albans, the abbot Michael died of the common plague at Easter, 1349,\r\none of the first victims in the monastery. The mortality in the house\r\nincreased daily, until forty-seven monks, “eminent for religion,” and\r\nincluding the prior and sub-prior, were dead, besides those who died in\r\nlarge numbers in the various cells or dependencies of the great religious\r\nhouse[251]. At the Yorkshire abbey of Meaux, in Holdernesse, the\r\nvisitation was in August, although the epidemic in the city of York was\r\nalready over by the end of July[252]. The abbot Hugh died at Meaux on the\r\n12th of August, and five other monks were lying unburied the same day.\r\nBefore the end of August twenty-two monks and six lay-brethren had died,\r\nand when the epidemic was over there were only ten monks and lay-brethren\r\nleft alive out of a total of forty-three monks (including the abbot) and\r\nseven lay-brethren. The chronicler adds that the greater part of the\r\ntenants on the abbey lands died also[253]. In the Lincolnshire monastery\r\nof Croxton, all the monks died save the abbot and prior[254]. In the\r\nhospital of Sandon, Surrey, the master and brethren all died[255].\r\n\r\nAt Ely 28 monks survived out of 43[256]. In the Irish monasteries the\r\nmortality had been equally severe: in the Franciscan convent at Drogheda,\r\n25 friars died; in the corresponding fraternity at Dublin, 23; and in that\r\nof Kilkenny 8 down to the 6th of March[257], with probably others (Clyn\r\nhimself) afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe following mortalities have been collected for East Anglian religious\r\nhouses: At Hickling, a religious house in Norfolk, with a prior and nine\r\nor ten canons (‘Monasticon’), only one canon survived. At Heveringham in\r\nthe same county the prior and canons died to a man. At the College of St\r\nMary in the Fields, near Norwich, five of the seven prebendaries died. Of\r\nseven nunneries in Norfolk and Suffolk, five lost their prioress as well\r\nas an unknown number of nuns[258]. At the nunnery of Great Winthorp on the\r\nHill, near Stamford, all the nuns save one either died of the plague or\r\nfled from it, so that the house fell to ruin and the lands were annexed by\r\na convent near it[259].\r\n\r\nThe experience of Canterbury appears to have been altogether different,\r\nand was perhaps exceptional. In a community of some eighty monks only four\r\ndied of the plague in 1349[260]. It is known, however, that when the new\r\nabbot of St Albans halted at Canterbury on his way to Avignon after his\r\nelection at Easter, one of the two monks who accompanied him was there\r\nseized with plague and died[261].\r\n\r\nThese monastic experiences in England were the same as in other parts of\r\nEurope. At Avignon, in 1348, sixty-six Carmelite monks were found lying\r\ndead in one monastery, no one outside the walls having heard that the\r\nplague was amongst them. In the English College at Avignon the whole of\r\nthe monks are said to have died[262].\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be said of the death-rate in the great mortality of 1349\r\nis constructive or inferential, and that part of the evidence, not the\r\nleast valuable of the whole, has been worked out only within a recent\r\nperiod. The enormous thinning of the ranks of the clergy was recorded at\r\nthe time, in general terms, by Knighton, and the difficulty of supplying\r\nthe parishes with educated priests is brought to light by various things,\r\nincluding the founding of colleges for their education at Cambridge\r\n(Corpus Christi) and at Oxford (Durham College). The first to examine\r\nclosely the number of vacancies in cures after the great mortality was\r\nBlomefield in the third volume of the _History of Norfolk_ published in\r\n1741. The Institution Book of the diocese of Norwich, he says (with a\r\nreference to No. IV. of the _Lib. Instit._), shows 863 institutions to\r\nbenefices in 1349, “the clergy dying so fast that they were obliged to\r\nadmit numbers of youths, that had only devoted themselves for clerks by\r\nbeing shaven, to be rectors of parishes[263].” A more precise use of\r\nInstitution Books, but more to show how zealous the clergy had been in\r\nexposing themselves to infection than to ascertain the death-rate, was\r\nmade (1825) for the archdeaconry of Salop. It was found that twenty-nine\r\nnew presentations, after death-vacancies, had been made in the single year\r\nof 1349, the average number of death vacancies at the time having been\r\nthree in two years[264]. The first systematic attempt to deduce the\r\nmortality of 1349 from the number of benefices vacant through death was\r\nmade in 1865 by Mr Seebohm, by original researches for the diocese of York\r\nand by using Blomefield’s collections for the diocese of Norwich[265]. In\r\nthe archdeaconry of the West Riding there were 96 death vacancies in 1349,\r\nleaving only 45 parishes in which the incumbent had survived. In the East\r\nRiding 60 incumbents died out of 95 parishes. In the archdeaconry of\r\nNottingham there were deaths of priests in 65 parishes, and 61 survivals.\r\nIn the diocese of Norwich there were 527 vacancies by death or transfer,\r\nwhile in 272 benefices there was no change. Thus the statement made to the\r\npope by the bishop of Norwich, that two-thirds of the clergy had died in\r\nthe great mortality is almost exact for his own diocese as well as for the\r\ndiocese of York. These figures of mortality among the Norfolk clergy were\r\nconfirmed, with fuller details, by a later writer[266]: the 527 new\r\ninstitutions in the diocese of Norwich fall between the months of March\r\nand October--23 before the end of April; 74 in May; 39 from 30th May to\r\n10th June; 100 from 10th June to 4th July; 209 in July; and 82 more to\r\nOctober. According to another enumeration of the same author for East\r\nAnglia, upwards of 800 parishes lost their parsons from March 1349 to\r\nMarch 1350, 83 parishes having been twice vacant, and 10 three times.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the significance of these facts as regards the\r\nclergy: some two-thirds of a class composed of adult males in moderate\r\ncircumstances, and living mostly in country villages, were cut off by the\r\nplague in Norfolk and Suffolk, in Yorkshire and Shropshire, and probably\r\nall over England. That alone would suffice to show that the virus of the\r\nBlack Death permeated the soil everywhere, country and town alike. It is\r\nthis universality of incidence that chiefly distinguishes the Black Death\r\nfrom the later outbreaks of plague, which were more often in towns than in\r\nvillages or scattered houses, and were seldom in many places in the same\r\nyear. But there remains to be mentioned, lastly, evidence inferential from\r\nanother source, which shows that the incidence in the country districts\r\nwas upon the people at large. That evidence is derived from the rolls of\r\nthe manor courts.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked in one of the earliest works (1852) upon the history of an\r\nEnglish manor and of its courts, that “the real life or history of a\r\nnation is to be gathered from the humble and seemingly trivial records of\r\nthese petty local courts[267],” and so the researches of the generation\r\nfollowing have abundantly proved. Much of this curious learning lies\r\noutside the present subject and is unfamiliar to the writer, but some of\r\nit intimately concerns us, and a few general remarks appear to be called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe manor was the unit of local government as the Normans found it. The\r\nlord of the manor and the cultivators of the soil had respectively their\r\nrights and duties, with a court to exact them. There are no written\r\nrecords of manor courts extant from a period before the reign of Edward\r\nI., when justice began to be administered according to regular forms. But\r\nin the year 1279 we find written rolls of a manor court[268]. From the\r\nreign of Edward III. these rolls begin to be fairly numerous; for example,\r\nthere is extant a complete series of them for the manor of Chedzey in\r\nSomerset from 1329-30 to 1413-14. The court met twice, thrice, or four\r\ntimes in the year, and the business transacted at each sitting was\r\nengrossed by the clerk upon a long roll of parchment. The business related\r\nto fines and heriots payable to the lord by the various orders of tenants\r\non various occasions, including changes in tenancy, successions by\r\nheirship, death-duties, the marriages of daughters, the births of\r\nillegitimate children, the commission of nuisances, poaching, and all\r\nmatters of petty local government. The first court of the year has usually\r\nthe longest roll, the parchment being written on one side, perhaps to the\r\nlength of twenty or twenty-four inches; the margin bears the amount of\r\nfines opposite each entry; there are occasionally jury lists where causes\r\nhad to be tried. Of the community whose business was thus managed a notion\r\nmay be formed from the instance of the Castle Combe manor[269]: in 1340 it\r\nhad two open fields, each of about 500 acres, on its hill-slopes,\r\ncultivated by 10 freemen tenants, 15 villeins, 11 other bondsmen\r\ncultivating a half-acre each; 8 tenants of cottages with crofts, 12\r\ntenants of cottages without crofts, as well as 3 tenants of cottages in\r\nMalmesbury.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that an unusual event such as the great\r\nmortality of 1348-49 would leave its mark upon the rolls of the manor\r\ncourts; the death-vacancies, with their fines and heriots, and all entries\r\nrelating to changes in tenancy, would be unusually numerous. Accordingly\r\nwe find in the rolls for that year that there was much to record; at the\r\nfirst glance the parchments are seen to be written within and without,\r\nlike the roll in the prophet’s vision; and that is perhaps all that the\r\ninspection will show unless the student be expert in one of the most\r\ndifficult of all kinds of ancient handwriting,--most difficult because\r\nmost full of contractions and conventional forms. But by a few those\r\npalaeographic difficulties have been surmounted (doubtless at some cost of\r\nexpert labour), and the results as regards the great mortality of 1349\r\nhave been disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe manor of Winslow, in Buckinghamshire, belonging to the great abbey of\r\nSt Albans, was a large and typical one[270]. Besides the principal village\r\nit had six hamlets. At the manor courts held in 1348-9 no fewer than 153\r\nholdings are entered as changing hands from the deaths of previous\r\nholders, the tenancies being either re-granted to the single heir of the\r\ndeceased or to reversioners, or, in default of such, retained by the lord.\r\nOf the 153 deceased tenants, 28 were holders of virgates and 14 of\r\nhalf-virgates; or, in other words, there died 42 small farmers,\r\ncultivating from forty to fifteen acres each, in half-acre strips\r\nscattered all over the common fields of the manor. These 42 held twice as\r\nmuch land as all the remaining 111 together; the latter more numerous\r\nclass were the crofters, who cultivated one or more half-acre strips: they\r\nwould include the various small traders, artisans and labourers of the\r\nvillage and its hamlets; while the former class represented “the highest\r\ngrades of tenants in villenage.”\r\n\r\nOf both classes together 153 had died in the great mortality. What\r\nproportion that number bore to the whole body of tenants on the manor may\r\nbe inferred from the following: out of 43 jurymen belonging almost\r\nexclusively to the class of larger holders, who had served upon the petty\r\njury in 1346, 1347 and 1348, as many as 27 had died in 1349; so that we\r\nmay reckon three out of every five adult males to have died in the Winslow\r\ndistrict, although it would be erroneous to conclude that the same\r\nproportion of adult women had died, or of aged persons, or of infants and\r\nyoung children.\r\n\r\nAnother more varied body of evidence has been obtained from researches in\r\nthe rolls of manor courts in East Anglia[271].\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Hunstanton, in the extreme north of Norfolk, with an area\r\nof about 2000 to 2500 acres, 63 men and 15 women had been carried off in\r\ntwo months: in 31 of these instances there were only women and children to\r\nsucceed, and in 9 of the cases there were no heirs at all; the whole\r\nnumber of tenants of the manor dead in eight months was 172, of whom 74\r\nleft no heirs male, and 19 others had no blood relations left to claim the\r\ninheritance. The following is the record of the manor court of Cornard\r\nParva, a small parish in Suffolk: on 31st March, 1349, 6 women and 3 men\r\nreported dead; on 1st May, 13 men and 2 women, of whom 7 had no heirs; at\r\nthe next meeting on 3 November, 36 more deaths of tenants, of whom 13 left\r\nno heirs. At Hadeston, a hamlet of Bunwell, twelve miles from Norwich,\r\nwhich could not possibly have had 400 inhabitants, 54 men and 14 women\r\nwere carried off in six months, 24 of them without anyone to inherit. At\r\nthe manor court of Croxton, near Thetford, on 24th July, 17 deaths are\r\nreported since last court, 8 of these without heirs. At the Raynham court,\r\non the same day, 18 tenements had fallen into the lord’s hands, 8 of them\r\nabsolutely escheated, and the rest retained until the heir should appear.\r\nAt other courts, the suits set down for hearing could not be proceeded\r\nwith owing to the deaths of witnesses (e.g. 11 deaths among 16 witnesses)\r\nor of principals. The manor court rolls of Lessingham have an entry, 15th\r\nJanuary, 1350, that only thirty shillings of tallage was demanded,\r\n“because the greater part of those tenants who were wont to render tallage\r\nhad died in the previous year by reason of the deadly pestilence[272].”\r\n\r\nFurther research upon the records of the manor courts will doubtless show\r\nthat the experience of Buckinghamshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Lancashire\r\nwas not singular. From the Castle Combe rolls nothing has been extracted\r\nas to the mortality in 1348-9, except one entry (Nov. 13, 1357) that a\r\ncertain tenement was ruinous, having remained in the lord’s hands since\r\nthe time of the pestilence for want of a purchaser; but it would be unsafe\r\nto conclude that this sequestered manor of Wiltshire had not shared the\r\ncommon fate. The accounts of certain manors in Hertfordshire were headed,\r\nfor thirty years after the Black Death, with a list of those who had\r\nvacated tenancies by death in that pestilence[273]. A decayed inscription\r\ncut in the stone of the parish church of Ashwell, in the same county,\r\nrecords the great mortality of 1349 and the great tempest in January,\r\n1362[274]. The tenants of the abbey of Meaux, in the Holdernesse division\r\nof Yorkshire, were nearly all dead, as well as the monks within the\r\nmonastery walls. On the manor of Ensham, near Oxford, “there remained\r\nhardly two tenants[275].”\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects of the great mortality were not so striking as might\r\nhave been supposed. Although it fell upon town and country in one terrific\r\nblow, yet some places had recovered from it before others felt it; it was\r\nover in Bristol (so far as we know) before it came to a height in London,\r\nand nearly over in London before it began in York. The dead were\r\nexpeditiously buried in trenches; vacancies among the clergy were promptly\r\nfilled; the manor courts met and transacted business, and had their\r\nrecords engrossed for the most part in the usual clerkly style. So great a\r\ndislocation of society naturally gave rise to some irregularities:\r\nstripping the dead is reported from one district in Norfolk, fights and\r\nquarrels came into court more often than ever in 1349 and 1350, and we\r\nread of two women who each had three husbands in as many months[276].\r\nKnighton says that sheep and cattle were left to wander about untended,\r\nand that they often perished in ditches by the wayside. A murrain occurred\r\nthe same year; at one place five thousand sheep died in the pasture and\r\nwere left to putrefy[277]. The price of a horse fell from forty shillings\r\nto half a marc; a fat ox could be bought for four shillings, a cow for\r\ntwelve pence, a heifer for sixpence, a fat sheep for four pence, a stone\r\nof wool for nine pence[278]. On the other hand, when the harvest of 1349\r\nhad to be gathered, the price of labour rose enormously. According to\r\nKnighton, a reaper got eightpence a day, with his food, and a mower\r\ntwelvepence. The extant accounts tabulated by Thorold Rogers confirm the\r\ncontemporary statement: the rates for threshing the harvest of 1349 were\r\nthose of panic and compulsion, being unparalleled, whether before or\r\nafter, in the Eastern, Midland and Southern counties; the immediate effect\r\nof the scarcity of hands was to nearly double the wages of labour for the\r\ntime being. Many villeins or bondsmen took the opportunity of escaping to\r\nthe towns or to distant manors, where they could make their own terms. Of\r\nthe last kind of incident, probably a very common one, we have an instance\r\nrecorded[279]: At an inquest, some years after the Black Death, upon\r\nsundry manors near Oxford belonging to Christ Church, it was ascertained\r\nthat, “in the time of the mortality or pestilence, which was in the year\r\n1349, there remained hardly two tenants in the said manor [Ensham], and\r\nthese had wished to leave, had not brother Nicholas de Upton, then abbot\r\nof the said manor, compounded anew with them, as well as with other\r\ntenants who came in.”\r\n\r\nSo far as regards the immediate effects of the great mortality. Its\r\nafter-effects, felt within a year or two, upon the economics and morals of\r\nthe country, upon the power of the old governing class, upon the\r\ndispersion of industries and the new life of towns, upon the system of\r\nfarming, upon the development of the legal profession in London, and upon\r\nvarious other things, are a much more intricate and disputable subject,\r\nsome part of which will be dealt with in the next chapter in connexion\r\nwith the subsequent history of plague or its domestication upon the soil\r\nof England. Many things in England were noted as having happened “sithen\r\nthe Pestilence,” to quote the stock phrase of the ‘Vision of Piers the\r\nPloughman,’ and not the least of them was the frequent recurrence of\r\nplague, or a prevalence of sickness so steady that the poet compares it to\r\nthe rain coming in through a leaky roof.\r\n\r\nSome historians have doubted whether after all the Black Death made so\r\nvery much difference to the course of affairs[280]. It is perhaps\r\ninevitable that scholars, accustomed to deal only with obvious human\r\ncausation, should look with some distrust upon the large claims made, in\r\nthe way of moral and social consequences, for a phenomenon which has been\r\napt to be classed with comets and earthquakes. The sudden thinning of the\r\npopulation may indeed become a subject for economists without any regard\r\nto the causation, and irrespectively of the means by which the numbers\r\nwere reduced; and that has been the only historic interest of the great\r\nmortality hitherto. But the operation of pestilence is peculiar; the\r\nthinning of the population is not effected as if in the due course of\r\nnature; the analogy is closer with a decimating or exterminating war. The\r\ninvasion of the Black Death was part of the great human drama, just as if\r\na swarming people or a barbarous conqueror had been visibly present in it.\r\nIf things were moving in the fourteenth century towards a particular\r\nissue, as historians find in their retrospect that they were, then the\r\ncoming of a great plague was part of that movement, organically bound up\r\nwith the other forces of it, and no more arbitrary than they. Thus it\r\nbecomes of interest to trace the antecedents of the Black Death before we\r\nattempt to follow out its consequences; and it is not the less of interest\r\nto do so, that the train of events leads us as far eastwards as the soil\r\nof China, and to the incidents that attended the collapse of the greatest\r\ngovernment of the Middle Ages, the empire of the Great Khan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Antecedents of the Black Death.\r\n\r\nWhen the Black Death in its progress westwards came to Constantinople in\r\n1347, the emperor-historian, John Cantacuzenes, was present in his capital\r\nto witness the arrival of the pestilence; in his history he wrote that it\r\ncame among them from the country of the hyperborean Scythians, that is to\r\nsay, the Tartars of the Crimea. The other contemporary Byzantine\r\nhistorian, Nicephorus Gregoras, says that the pestilence began among the\r\nScythians in the Crimea and at the mouths of the Don. The Russian annals,\r\nwhich are an independent source, and likely enough to have a correct\r\ntradition, also say that the plague was God’s punishment on the people of\r\nthe Don territory and of several other localities with obsolete names,\r\nincluding the famous city of Sarai on the Volga[281]. The Chersonese, and\r\nthe country from the Don to the Volga, or from the Euxine to the Caspian,\r\nare the regions thus clearly indicated as the scene of the first outburst\r\nof the Black Death; but there was no clue to its unaccountable appearance\r\nthere, or to the connexion between its outburst on the confines of Europe\r\nand the distant home in the East which the rumour of the day vaguely\r\nassigned to it. The more definite association of the Black Death with\r\nChina dates from 1757, when the abbé Des Guignes, in his _Histoire des\r\nHuns_[282], took up the old tradition of the Arab historian, Aboel\r\nMahasin, that the plague began in Tartary, that the smell of corpses\r\nspread on every side, that the infection passed from Cathay or Tartary to\r\nthe Tartars of the Kaptchac (Crimea), and from them to Constantinople and\r\nEurope on the one hand, and to Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt and North Africa\r\non the other. He pointed out also that the overland caravan trade was a\r\nready means of transport for the infection. That which specially attracted\r\nhis attention as the historian of the Mongol power was the other statement\r\nof the Arab historian in the same context, that China had been visited by\r\nfloods so disastrous that men, beasts, and even birds perished, and that\r\nthe country was almost depopulated. Upon that hint Des Guignes collected\r\nfrom the Chinese annals of the first half of the fourteenth century a\r\nconsiderable list[283] of calamities, which had actually happened--floods\r\ncausing the loss of millions of lives, earthquakes, and the like,\r\nappending the catalogue without comment as a note to the text where he has\r\noccasion to mention the Black Death. Des Guignes’ note was reproduced\r\nverbatim by Hecker in his essay on the Black Death in 1832, and the\r\nunwonted series of phenomena in China was made the basis of certain\r\nmystical speculations as to the effect of earthquakes in causing a\r\n“progressive infection of the zones,” a perturbation of “the earth’s\r\norganism,” a “baneful commotion of the atmosphere,” or the like. In that\r\nnebulous and unsatisfactory state the old tradition of the Black Death\r\noriginating in China has remained to the present hour; the intuition of\r\nthe Peking Jesuit had merely been appropriated and set forth in his own\r\nway by the German “Naturphilosoph[284].”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1842 a clue to Des Guignes’ conjecture of a connexion\r\nbetween the importation of the Black Death and the China land-route was\r\nfound (but not followed up) in the discovery by Henschel of a Latin\r\nmanuscript in the Rhediger Library at Breslau[285]. This was a narrative\r\ncompiled by one Gabriel de Mussis, a jurist of Piacenza, who had been\r\npractising as a notary or advocate among the Genoese and Venetians trading\r\naround the shores of the Euxine and Caspian, and had been an eyewitness of\r\nthe outbreak of the plague in that region. De Mussis has no theory of the\r\norigin of the plague; he merely narrates the events as they unfolded\r\nthemselves before his own eyes; so much was he in the midst of them that\r\nhe was a passenger on board the very ship which brought the first seeds of\r\nthe Black Death direct from the Crimea to Genoa as early as the spring of\r\n1347.\r\n\r\n    The substance of this story is that the Italian merchants, who were\r\n    then settled in considerable numbers at the various termini or\r\n    entrepôts of the overland trade from China and Central Asia by the\r\n    more northern route, were harassed by the Tartar hordes; that they had\r\n    stood a siege in Tana, on the Don, but had been driven out of it, and\r\n    had sought refuge for themselves and their merchandise within the\r\n    walls of Caffa, a small fortified post on the Crimean Straits (of\r\n    Kertch), built by Genoese not long before; that Caffa was besieged in\r\n    due course by the Tartar barbarians; that the investment lasted nearly\r\n    three years; that the merchants and others, crowded into the narrow\r\n    space within the walls, were put to great straits and could hardly\r\n    breathe, being only partially relieved by the arrival of a ship with\r\n    supplies; that the plague broke out among the besieging Tartar host\r\n    and daily destroyed thousands; that the Tartars threw the pestilent\r\n    dead bodies inside the walls by their engines of siege, so that the\r\n    infection took hold of those within the fort; that the Tartars\r\n    dispersed in panic and spread the infection all over the shores of the\r\n    Euxine, Caspian and Levant; that such of the Italian traders as were\r\n    able, De Mussis himself with them, escaped from Caffa in a ship; and\r\n    that the infection appeared in Genoa in its most deadly form a day or\r\n    two after the arrival of the ship, although none of those on board\r\n    were suffering from the plague.\r\n\r\nThese are all the circumstances related by De Mussis of the beginning of\r\nthe outbreak as known to himself at first hand: the rest of his narrative\r\nis occupied with various incidents of the plague in Europe, with pious\r\nreflections, and accounts of portents. His single reference to China is as\r\nfollows: “In the Orient, about Cathay, where is the head of the world and\r\nthe beginning of the earth, horrible and fearful signs appeared; for\r\nserpents and frogs, descending in dense rains, entered the dwellings and\r\nconsumed countless numbers, wounding them by their venom and corroding\r\nthem with their teeth. In the meridian parts, about the Indies, regions\r\nwere overturned by earthquakes, and cities wasted in ruin, tongues of\r\nflame being shot forth. Fiery vapours burnt up many, and in places there\r\nwere copious rains of blood and murderous showers of stones.” De Mussis\r\nhas certainly no scientific intention; nor can it be said that any\r\nscientific use has been made of his manuscript since its discovery. For\r\nHäser, its editor, merely reproduces in his history the passage from\r\nHecker on the three overland routes between Europe and the East, without\r\nremarking on the fact that De Mussis definitely places the outbreak of the\r\nplague at the European terminus of one of them: its remote origin is\r\ninvolved in “impenetrable obscurity;” all we can say is that it came from\r\nthe East, “the cradle of the human race[286].”\r\n\r\nBut the entirely credible narrative by De Mussis of the outbreak of plague\r\nat the siege of Caffa is just the clue that was wanting to unravel the\r\nmeaning of the widespread rumour of the time, that the plague came from\r\nChina. Let us first examine somewhat closely the source of that rumour. It\r\nfinds its most definite expression in an Arabic account of the Black Death\r\nat Granada, by the famous Moorish statesman of that city,\r\nIbn-ul-Khatib[287]. Besides giving the local circumstances for Granada, he\r\nmakes various remarks on the nature of the plague, and on its mode of\r\nspreading, which are not exceeded in shrewdness and insight by the more\r\nscientific doctrines of later times. Its origin in China he repeats on the\r\nauthority of several trustworthy and far-travelled men, more particularly\r\nof his celebrated countryman Ibn-Batuta, or “the Traveller,” whose story\r\nwas that the plague arose in China from the corruption of many corpses\r\nafter a war, a famine, and a conflagration.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Ibn-Batuta, as the authority more particularly, has a\r\nspecial interest. That traveller was actually in China from 1342 to 1346.\r\nIn his book of travels[288] he tells us how on his way back (he took the\r\nEast-Indian sea-route to the Persian Gulf) he came at length to Damascus,\r\nAleppo and Cairo in the summer of 1348, and was a witness of the Black\r\nDeath at each of those places, and of the mixed religious processions at\r\nDamascus of Jews with their Hebrew Scriptures and Christians with their\r\nGospels. But he says not one word anywhere as to the origin of the plague\r\nin China, whence he was journeying homewards. He continued his journey to\r\nTangier, his birthplace, and crossed thence to Spain about the beginning\r\nof 1350. At Granada he spent some days among his countrymen, of whom he\r\nmentions in his journal four by name; but the most famous of them,\r\nIbn-ul-Khatib, he does not mention. However, here was Ibn-Batuta at\r\nGranada, a year or two after the Black Death, discoursing on all manner of\r\ntopics with the most eminent Moors of the place; and here is one of them,\r\nIbn-ul-Khatib, in an account of the Black Death at Granada, quoting the\r\nreport of Ibn-Batuta that the pestilence arose in China from the\r\ncorruption of unburied corpses. None of the other statements of an Eastern\r\norigin can compare with this in precision or in credibility; they all\r\nindeed confuse the backward extension of the plague from the Euxine\r\neastwards to Khiva, Bokhara and the like, with its original progress\r\ntowards Europe from a source still farther east. The authority of\r\nIbn-Batuta himself is not, of course, that of historian or observer;\r\nalthough he was in China during part, at least, of the national calamities\r\nwhich the Chinese Annals record, he says nothing of them, and probably\r\nwitnessed nothing of them. But the traveller was a likely person to have\r\nheard correctly the gossip of the East and to have judged of its\r\ncredibility; so that there is a satisfaction in tracing it through him.\r\n\r\nThe siege of Caffa, and the general circumstances of it, we may take as\r\nhistorical on the authority of the Italian notary who was there; but it\r\nmay be doubted whether the plague began, as he says, among the nomade\r\nhordes outside the fort. In sieges it has been not unusual for both sides\r\nto suffer from infective disease; and although it is not always easy to\r\nsay where the disease may have begun, the presumption is that it arose\r\namong those who were most crowded, most pressed by want, and most\r\ndesponding in spirit. It is, of course, not altogether inconceivable that\r\nthe Tartar besiegers of Caffa had bred a pestilential disease in their\r\ncamp; the nomades of the Cyrenaic plateau have bred bubo-plague itself\r\nmore than once in recent years in their wretched summer tents, and plague\r\nhas appeared from time to time in isolated or remote Bedouin villages on\r\nthe basaltic plateaus of Arabia. There is nothing in the nomade manner of\r\nlife adverse to pestilential products, least of all in the life of nomades\r\nencamped for a season. But such outbreaks of bubo-plague or of typhus\r\nfever have been local, sporadic, or non-diffusive. On the other hand the\r\nplague which arose at the siege of Caffa was the Black Death, one of the\r\ntwo greatest pestilences in the history of the world. Let us then see\r\nwhether there is any greater likelihood of finding inside the walls of\r\nCaffa the lurking germs of so great a pestilence. Within the walls of the\r\nGenoese trading fort were the Italian merchants driven in from all around\r\nthat region, with their merchandise--as De Mussis says, _fugientes pro\r\nsuarum tutione personarum et rerum_. Previous to their three years’ siege\r\nin Caffa they, or some of them, had stood a siege in Tana, and had\r\nretreated to the next post on the homeward route. Tana was at the\r\neastward bend of the Don, whence the road across the steppe is shortest to\r\nthe westward bend of the Volga; a little above the bend of the Volga was\r\nthe great city of Sarai--whence the caravans started on their overland\r\njourney along northern parallels, across mountain ranges and the desert of\r\nGobi, to enter China at its north-western angle, just within the end of\r\nthe Great Wall[289]. The merchandise of Sarai and Tana was the return\r\nmerchandise of China--the bales of silks and fine cloths, spices and\r\ndrugs, which had become the articles of a great commerce between China and\r\nEurope since Marco Polo first showed the way, and which continued to reach\r\nEurope by the caravan routes until about 1360: then the route was closed\r\nowing to the final overthrow of the authority of the Great Khan, which had\r\nonce secured a peaceful transit from the Yellow Sea to the Black Sea--so\r\ncompletely closed that men forgot, two hundred years after, that it had\r\never existed.\r\n\r\nDid these bales of Chinese stuffs, carried into Caffa for protection,\r\ncontain the seeds of the Black Death? There is, at least, nothing\r\nimprobable in the seeds of plague lurking in bales of goods; that mode of\r\ntransmission was afterwards recognized as highly characteristic of the\r\nplague during its Levantine days. Nor is there anything improbable in the\r\nseeds of an infection being carried thousands of miles across the deserts\r\nof Central Asia; cholera came in that way from India in 1827-8 by the\r\ncaravan-route to Cabul, Balkh, Bokhara, Khiva and the Kirghiz Steppe to\r\nOrenburg, and again in 1847 to Astrakhan; and the slow land-borne viruses\r\nof those two great epidemics exceeded in virulence the later importations\r\nof cholera by the sea route from the East. Still farther, there is nothing\r\nimprobable in the germs of plague lying latent for a long time, or in the\r\ndisease existing as a potency although not manifested in a succession of\r\ncases. The next stage of its progress, from Caffa to Genoa, illustrates\r\nthat very point; for we know that there were no cases of plague on board\r\nship, although the very atmosphere or smell of the new arrival seemed\r\nsufficient to taint the whole air of Genoa, and to carry death to every\r\npart of the city within a couple of days. And lastly the long imprisonment\r\nof a virus in bales of goods, the crowding of merchants and merchandise\r\ninto the narrow space of a walled seaport, amidst the almost inevitable\r\nsqualor and fœtor of a three years’ siege, were the very circumstances\r\nneeded to raise the potency of the assumed virus to an unusual height, to\r\ngive it a degree of virulence that would make it effective, and a power of\r\ndiffusion that would spread and continue the liberated infection after the\r\nmanner of the greatest of pestilences.\r\n\r\nThus, if we have to choose between the origin of the plague-virus among\r\nthe Tartar hordes besieging the China merchants within the walls of Caffa,\r\nand the pre-existence of that virus, for a long time latent, among the\r\ngoods or effects of the besieged, the latter hypothesis must be accorded\r\nthe advantage in probability. Accepting it, we follow the virus back to\r\nTana on the Don, from Tana to Sarai on the Volga, from Sarai by a\r\nwell-trodden route which need not be particularized[290], for many weeks’\r\njourney until we come to the soil of China. According to a dominant school\r\nof epidemiologists it is always enough to have traced a virus to a remote\r\nsource, to the “roof of the world” or to the back of the east wind, and\r\nthere to leave it, in the full assurance that there must have been\r\ncircumstances to account for its engendering there, perhaps in an equally\r\nremote past, if only we knew them. If, however, we follow the trail back\r\ndefinitely to China, it is our duty to connect it there with an actual\r\nhistory or tradition, immemorial if need be, of Chinese plague. But there\r\nis no such history or tradition to be found. We know something of the\r\nChina of Kublai Khan, fifty years before, from the book of Marco Polo; and\r\nthe only possible reference to plague there is an ambiguous statement\r\nabout “carbuncles” in a remote province, which was probably Yun-nan. Not\r\nonly so, but if we scrutinize the Chinese Annals closely, we shall find\r\nthat the thirty years preceding the Black Death were indeed marked by many\r\ngreat calamities and loss of life on a vast scale, by floods, droughts,\r\nearthquakes, famines and famine-fevers, but not by pestilence unconnected\r\nwith these; on the other hand, the thirty or forty years after the Black\r\nDeath had overrun Europe, beginning with the year 1352, are marked in the\r\nChinese Annals (as summarized in the _Imperial Encyclopædia_ of Peking,\r\n1726) by a succession of “great plagues” in various provinces of the\r\nEmpire, which are not associated with calamitous seasons, but stand alone\r\nas disease-calamities pure and simple[291]. If the Black Death connects at\r\nall with events in China, these events were natural calamities and their\r\nattendant loss of life, and not outbreaks of plague itself; for the\r\nlatter, assuming them to have been bubo-plague, were subsequent in China\r\nto the devastation of Europe by the plague.\r\n\r\nWe are left, then, to make what we can of the antecedent calamities of\r\nChina; and we may now revert to the curious rumour of the time that the\r\nrelevant thing in China was the corruption of many corpses left unburied\r\nafter inundation, war and conflagration. So far as war and conflagration\r\nare concerned they are quite subordinate; there was no war except an\r\noccasional ineffective revolt in some remote western province, and the\r\nconflagrations were minor affairs, noticed, indeed, in the Annals, but\r\nlost among the greater calamities. The floods, droughts and famines were\r\nevents of almost annual recurrence for many years before, so that no\r\nperiod in the Annals of China presents such a continuous picture of\r\nnational calamity, full as Chinese history has at all times been of\r\ndisasters of the same kind. It was the decadence of the great Mongol\r\nempire, founded by Genghiz and carried by Kublai to that marvellous height\r\nof splendour and prosperity which we read of in the book of Marco Polo.\r\nThe warlike virtues of the earlier Mongol rulers had degenerated in their\r\nsuccessors into sensual vices during the times of peace; and the history\r\nof the country, priest-ridden, tax-burdened, and ruled by women and\r\neunuchs, neglected in its thousand water-ways and in all the safeguards\r\nagainst floods and famine which wiser rulers had set up, became from year\r\nto year an illustration of the ancient Chinese maxim, that misgovernment\r\nin the palace is visited by the anger of the sky.\r\n\r\n    The following epitome of the calamities in China is taken from De\r\n    Mailla’s _Histoire générale de la Chine_. Paris, 1777, 9 vols. 4to., a\r\n    translation of the abridged official annals.\r\n\r\n    The year 1308 marks the beginning of the series of bad seasons.\r\n    Droughts in some places, floods in others, locusts and failure of the\r\n    crops, brought famine and pestilence. The people in Kiang-Hoaï were\r\n    reduced to live on wild roots and the bark of trees. In Ho-nan and\r\n    Chan-tong the fathers ate the flesh of the children. The imperial\r\n    granaries were still able to supply grain, but not nearly enough for\r\n    the people’s wants. The provinces of Kiang-si and Che-kiang were\r\n    depopulated by the plague or malignant fever which followed the\r\n    famine. The ministers sent in their resignations, which were not\r\n    accepted.\r\n\r\n    In 1313 the same events recur, including the resignations of\r\n    ministers. An epidemic carried off many in the capital, and the whole\r\n    empire was desolated by drought. At a council of ministers to devise\r\n    remedies and avert further calamities it was proposed by some to copy\r\n    the institutions of ancient empires celebrated for their virtue, and\r\n    by others to abolish the Bhuddist priesthood of Foh as the cause of\r\n    all misfortunes. The throne is now occupied by Gin-tsong, an emperor\r\n    of a serious and ascetic disposition. In 1314 he revived the old\r\n    Chinese system of competitive examinations and the distinctive dress\r\n    among the grades of mandarins, which the earlier Mongol rulers had\r\n    been able to dispense with. Next year there is a public distribution\r\n    of grain, and a check to the exactions of tax-gatherers in the\r\n    distressed districts. In 1317, it appears that the provincial\r\n    mandarins, in defiance of express orders, had neglected the laws of\r\n    Kublai with reference to the distribution of grain, although it was\r\n    dangerous to defer such public aid longer; they had failed also to\r\n    relax their rigour in collecting the taxes. One day the emperor found\r\n    at Peking a soldier in rags from a distant garrison, and discovered\r\n    that a system of embezzlement in the army clothing department had been\r\n    going on for five years. Gin-tsong is reported to have said to his\r\n    ministers, “My august predecessors have left wise laws, which I have\r\n    always had at heart to follow closely; but I see with pain that they\r\n    are neglected, and that my people are unhappy.”\r\n\r\n    In 1318 we read of a great flood in one province, of multitudes\r\n    drowned, and of a public distribution of grain. In 1320, forty of the\r\n    Censors of the Empire remonstrated against the cruel exactions of\r\n    “public leeches,” and against a practice of calumniating honest men so\r\n    as to get them out of the way. The emperor Gin-tsong died in that\r\n    year, aged thirty-three, and with his death the last serious attempt\r\n    to check the flood of corruption came to an end. In 1321 there is\r\n    drought in Ho-nan, followed by famine. In 1324 we read of droughts,\r\n    locusts, inundations and earthquakes. The emperor demanded advice of\r\n    the nobles, ministers and wise men, and received the following answer:\r\n    “While the palace of the prince is full of eunuchs, astrologers,\r\n    physicians, women, and other idle people, whose maintenance costs the\r\n    State an enormous sum, the people are plunged in extreme misery. The\r\n    empire is a family, and the emperor its father: let him listen to the\r\n    cries of the miserable.” In 1325 famine follows the disasters of the\r\n    year before; and we learn that the people were supplied from the full\r\n    granaries of the rich, who were paid, not out of the State treasury,\r\n    but by places in the mandarinate! In 1326 the tyranny and\r\n    licentiousness of the Bhuddist lamas reaches a climax, and an edict is\r\n    issued against them. The year 1327 is marked by a series of calamities\r\n    and portents--drought, locusts, ruined crops, earthquakes,\r\n    inundations. In 1330, again floods and the harvest destroyed, a cruel\r\n    famine in Hou-Kouang, millions of acres of land ruined, and 400,000\r\n    families reduced to beggary. In 1331 the harvest is worse than in the\r\n    year before--in Che-kiang there were more than 800,000 families who\r\n    did not gather a single grain of corn or rice,--and all the while\r\n    enormous taxes were ground out of universal poverty.\r\n\r\n    In 1333 begins the long and calamitous reign of Shun-ti, who came to\r\n    the throne a weak youth of thirteen. Next year the misfortunes of\r\n    China touch their highest point. Inundations ruined the crops in\r\n    Chan-tong; a drought in Che-kiang brought famine and pestilence; in\r\n    the southern provinces generally, famine and floods caused the deaths\r\n    of 2,270,000 families, or of 13,000,000 individuals. In 1336\r\n    inundations in Chan-tong ruined the harvest; in Kiang-nan and\r\n    Che-kiang the first harvest was a failure from drought, multitudes\r\n    perished of hunger, and a plague broke out. The emperor, insensible to\r\n    the misfortunes of his people, abandons himself to his pleasures. Next\r\n    year sees the first of those provincial revolts, led by obscure\r\n    Chinese peasants, which eventually overthrew the dynasty in 1368.\r\n    Floods occurred in more than one river basin, by which multitudes of\r\n    men and beasts were drowned; in the valley of the Kiang (a tributary\r\n    of the Hoang-ho) four millions perished. For several years we read of\r\n    numerous and repeated shocks of earthquakes, in 1341 of a great\r\n    famine, in 1342 of a famine so severe that human flesh was eaten, in\r\n    1343 of seven towns submerged, in 1344 of a great tract of country\r\n    inundated by the sea in consequence of an earthquake, in 1345 of\r\n    earthquakes in Pe-chili, in 1346 of earthquakes for seven days in\r\n    Chan-tong, and of a great famine in Chan-si. In 1347 earthquakes in\r\n    various provinces, and drought in Ho-tong, followed by many deaths.\r\n    The record of disasters in De Mailla’s abridged annals, and in Des\r\n    Guignes, who had clearly access to fuller narrations, comes to an end\r\n    for a time at the year 1347.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in these records there is comparatively little\r\nsaid of epidemic sickness. The references to pestilence would in no case\r\nsuggest more than the typhus fever which has been the usual attendant upon\r\nChinese famines, and has never shown the independent vitality and\r\ndiffusive properties of plague. But the minor place occupied by actual\r\npestilence in China, in the years before the Black Death in Europe, is\r\nbrought out even more clearly on comparing that period with the section of\r\nthe Chinese annals for the generation following. In the chronology of\r\nChinese epidemics drawn up by Gordon (London, 1884) from the Peking\r\n_Encyclopædia_ of 1726, there are, from 1308-1347, just the same entries\r\nof pestilence as are given above from De Mailla’s and Des Guignes’ French\r\nadaptation of the Annals. (Gordon makes the obvious mistake of attributing\r\nto pestilence the enormous loss of life which the Annals clearly assigned\r\nto floods and famines, with their attendant sickness.) But with the year\r\n1352 we enter upon a great pestilential period, as clearly marked in the\r\nhistory of China by the annual recurrence of vast epidemics as the decades\r\nbefore it were marked by the unusual frequency of floods, famines and\r\nearthquakes. Every year from 1352 to 1363, except 1355, has an entry of\r\n“great pestilence” or “great plague” (yi-li), in one province or another,\r\nalthough the old tale of floods and famines has come to an end in the\r\nAnnals. The last of the nearly continuous series of great pestilences is\r\nin 1369, when there was a great pest in Fukien, and “the dead lay in heaps\r\non the ground.” There is then a break until 1380, and after that a longer\r\nbreak until 1403. It would thus appear as if the great pestilential period\r\nof China in the fourteenth century had not coincided with the succession\r\nof disastrous seasons, but had followed the latter at a distinct interval.\r\nConversely the years of plague from 1352 to 1369 do not appear to have\r\nbeen years of inundations and bad harvests; they stand out in the\r\nchronology, by comparison, as years of plague-sickness pure and simple;\r\nand although nothing is said to indicate the type of bubo-plague, yet the\r\ndisease can hardly be assumed to have been the old famine fevers or other\r\nsickness directly due to floods and scarcity, so long as not a word is\r\nsaid of floods and famines in that context or in the Annals generally. The\r\nsuggestion is that the soil of China may not have felt the full effects of\r\nthe plague virus, originally engendered thereon, until some few years\r\nafter the same had been carried to Europe, having produced there within a\r\nshort space of time the stupendous phenomenon of the Black Death. If\r\nthere be something of a paradox in that view, it is the facts themselves\r\nthat refuse to fall into what might be thought the natural sequence.\r\n\r\nThe historian Gaubil thinks that the national Annals make the most of\r\nthese recurring calamities, having been written by the official scribes of\r\nthe next dynasty, who sought to discredit the Mongol rule as much as\r\npossible[292]; but it is not suggested that the compilers had invented the\r\nseries of disasters,--now in one province or river basin, now in another,\r\nat one time with thirteen millions of lives lost, at another with four\r\nhundred thousand families reduced to beggary, this time a drought, and\r\nnext time a flood, and in another series of years a succession of\r\ndestructive earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWe are here concerned with discovering any possible relation that these\r\ndisasters, coming one upon another almost without time for recovery, can\r\nhave had to the engendering of the plague-virus. According to the rumours\r\nof the time, it was the corruption of unburied corpses in China which\r\ncaused the Black Death; and certainly the unburied corpses were there, a\r\n_vera causa_, if that were all. Recent experiences in China make it easy\r\nfor us to construct in imagination the state of the shores of rivers after\r\nthose fatal inundations of the fourteenth century, or of the roadsides\r\nafter the recurring famines. Thus, of the famine of 1878 it is said[293]:\r\n“Coffins are not to be got for the corpses, nor can graves be prepared for\r\nthem. Their blood is a dispersed mass on the ground, their bones lie all\r\nabout.... Pestilence [it is otherwise known to have been typhus fever]\r\ncomes with the famine, and who can think of medicine for the plague or\r\ncoffins for the multitude of the dead?” Or, again, according to a memorial\r\nin the official Peking Gazette of 16 January, 1878, “the roads are lined\r\nwith corpses in such numbers as to distance all efforts for their\r\ninterment[294].”\r\n\r\nThere is much of sameness in the history of China from century to century;\r\nwhat happened in 1878, and again on a lesser scale two or three years\r\nago, must have happened on an unparalleled scale year after year during\r\nthe ill-starred period which ended about 1342; there must have been no\r\nordinary break-down in the decencies and sanitary safeguards of interment\r\nin such years as 1334, when thirteen millions (two million, two hundred\r\nand seventy thousand families) were swept away by the floods of the\r\nYang-tsi, or destroyed by hunger and disease. But we are not left\r\naltogether to the exercise of the imagination. A strangely vivid picture\r\nremains to us of a scene in China in those years, which a returning\r\nmissionary saw as in a vision. The friar Odoric, of Pordenone, had spent\r\nsix years in Northern China previous to 1327 or 1328, when he returned to\r\nItaly by one of the overland routes. The story of his travels[295] was\r\nafterwards taken down from his lips, and it is made to end with one\r\ngruesome scene, which is brought in without naming the time or the place.\r\nIt is a vision of a valley of death, invested with the same air of\r\ngenerality as in Bunyan’s allegory of the common lot.\r\n\r\n    “Another great and terrible thing I saw. For, as I went through a\r\n    certain valley which lieth by the River of Delights (_flumen\r\n    deliciarum_) I saw therein many dead corpses lying. And I heard also\r\n    therein sundry kinds of music, but chiefly nakers, which were\r\n    marvellously played upon. And so great was the noise thereof that very\r\n    great fear came upon me. Now, this valley is seven or eight miles\r\n    long; and if any unbeliever enter therein, he quitteth it never again,\r\n    but perisheth incontinently. Yet I hesitated not to go in that I might\r\n    see once for all what the matter was. And when I had gone in I saw\r\n    there, as I have said, such numbers of corpses as no one without\r\n    seeing it could deem credible. And at one side of the valley, in the\r\n    very rock, I beheld as it were the face of a man very great and\r\n    terrible, so very terrible indeed that for my exceeding great fear my\r\n    spirit seemed to die in me. Wherefore I made the sign of the Cross,\r\n    and began continually to repeat _Verbum caro factum_, but I dared not\r\n    at all come nigh that face, but kept at seven or eight paces from it.\r\n    And so I came at length to the other end of the valley, and there I\r\n    ascended a hill of sand and looked around me.”\r\n\r\nNarrated as it is of no specified place and of no one year of his journey,\r\nit may stand, and perhaps it was meant to stand, for a common experience\r\nof China in the period of Mongol decadence. Whether he left the country by\r\nthe gorges of the Yang-tsi and the Yun-nan route, or along the upper\r\nbasin of the Hoang-ho by the more usual northern route to the desert of\r\nGobi, his vision of a Valley of Corpses is equally significant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory of the Plague-Virus.\r\n\r\nThe question that remains is the connexion, in pathological theory,\r\nbetween the bubo-plague and the corruption of the unburied dead or of the\r\nimperfectly buried dead. Some such connexion was the rumour of the time,\r\nbefore any scientific theory can well have existed. Also the factor in\r\nquestion was undoubtedly there among the antecedents, if it were not even\r\nthe most conspicuous of the antecedents. But we might still be following a\r\nwandering light if we were to trust the theory of the Black Death to those\r\nempirical suggestions, striking and plausible though they be. It is not\r\nfor the Black Death only, but for the great plagues of the Mohammedan\r\nconquests, which preceded the Black Death by many centuries and also\r\nfollowed that great intercurrent wave until long after in their own strict\r\nsuccession, for the circumscribed spots of plague in various parts of Asia\r\nand Africa in our own day, and above all for the great plague of\r\nJustinian’s reign,--it is for them all that a theory of bubo-plague is\r\nneeded. A survey of the circumstances of all these plagues will either\r\nweaken or strengthen, destroy or establish, the theory that the virus of\r\nthe Black Death had arisen on the soil of China from the cadaveric poison\r\npresent in some peculiar potency, and had been carried to Europe in the\r\ncourse of that overland trade at whose terminus we first hear of its\r\nvirulence being manifested.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the origin of the plague-virus from the corruption of the\r\ndead was a common one in the sixteenth century. It was held by Ambroise\r\nParé among others, and it was elaborately worked out for the Egypt of his\r\nday by Prosper Alpinus, physician to the Venetian Consulate at Cairo\r\ntowards the end of the same century. But the most brilliant exposition of\r\nit, one of the finest exercises of diction and of reasoning that has ever\r\nissued from the profession of medicine, was that given for the origin in\r\nEgypt of the great plague of Justinian’s reign by Etienne Pariset,\r\nsecretary to the Académie de Médecine and commissioner from France to\r\nstudy the plague in Syria and Egypt in 1829[296].\r\n\r\nIn the plague-stricken Egypt of that time, overburdened with population\r\nand still awaiting the beneficent rule of Mehemet Ali, Dr Pariset had his\r\nattention forcibly directed to the same contrast between the modern and\r\nancient manner of disposing of the dead, and to the insuitability of the\r\nformer to the Delta, which had been remarked by Prosper Alpinus in 1591,\r\nand by De Maillet, French consul at Cairo, in 1735, and had been specially\r\ndwelt upon by _philosophes_ of the eighteenth century, such as\r\nMontesquieu, Volney and De Pauw. On the one hand he saw under his eyes\r\nvarious revolting things in the Delta,--brick tombs invaded by water, an\r\noccasional corpse floating at large, canals choked with the putrefying\r\nbodies of bullocks dead of a murrain, the courtyards of Coptic and Jewish\r\nhouses, and the floors of mosques, churches and monasteries filled with\r\ngenerations of the dead in their flooded vaults and catacombs. On the\r\nother hand he saw, on the slopes of the Libyan range and on the edge of\r\nthe desert beyond the reach of the inundation, the occasional openings of\r\na vast and uncounted series of rock-grottoes in which the Egyptians of the\r\npre-Christian era had carefully put away every dead body, whether of bird,\r\nor of beast, or of human kind. He was persuaded of the truth of Volney’s\r\nremark, “In a crowded population, under a hot sun, and in a soil filled\r\ndeep with water during several months of every year, the _rapid_\r\nputrefaction of bodies becomes a leaven of plague and of other\r\ndisease[297].” The remark of De Pauw, although it is not adduced, was\r\nequally to the point: “Neither men nor beasts are any longer embalmed in\r\nEgypt; but the ancient Egyptians seem to have done well in following that\r\nmode, and in keeping the mummies in the deepest recesses of excavated\r\nrocks.... Were we to note here all that those two nations [Arabs and\r\nTurks] have left undone, and everything that they ought not to have done,\r\nit would be easy to understand how a country formerly not altogether\r\nunhealthy, is now become a hotbed of the plague[298].” These\r\neighteenth-century reflections, casual and discursive after the manner of\r\nthe time, were amplified by Pariset to scientific fulness and order, and\r\nset in permanent classical form. Like De Pauw and Volney, he extolled the\r\nancient sanitary wisdom of Egypt, and excused the priestly mask of\r\nsuperstition for the implicit obedience that it secured. De Pauw had\r\npointed out that the towns most remarkable for the worship of\r\ncrocodiles,--Coptos, Arsinöe (Crocodilopolis), and Athribis,--were all\r\nsituated on canals at some distance from the Nile; the crocodiles could\r\nnever have got to them unless the canals were kept clear; according to\r\nAelian and Eusebius the crocodile was the symbol of water fit to drink; so\r\nthat the superstitious worship of the animal was in effect the motive for\r\nkeeping the canals of the Nile in repair. The priests of Egypt, says\r\nPariset, with their apparatus of fictions and emblems, sought to veil from\r\nthe profane eyes of the vulgar and of strangers the secrets of a sublime\r\nphilosophy[299]. They made things sacred so as to make them binding, so as\r\nto constrain by the force of religion, as Moses did, their disciple. They\r\nhad to reckon with the annual overflow of the Nile, with a hot sun, and a\r\ncrowded population. Suppose that all the dead animal matter, human or\r\nother, were to be incorporated with the soil under these rapid changes of\r\nsaturation and drying, of diffusion and emanation, what a mass of poison,\r\nwhat danger to the living! What foresight they showed in avoiding it, what\r\nlabour and effort, but what results! Can anyone pretend that a system so\r\nvast, so beautiful, so coherent in all its parts, had been engendered and\r\nconserved merely by an ignorant fanaticism, or that a people who had so\r\nmuch of wisdom in their actions had none in their thoughts? Looking around\r\nhim at the Egypt of the Christian and Mohammedan eras, he asks, What has\r\nbecome of that hygiene, attentive, scrupulous and enlightened, of that\r\nmarvellous police of sepulture, of that prodigious care to preserve the\r\nsoil from all admixture of putrescible matters? The ancient learning of\r\nEgypt, the wisdom taught by hard experience in remote ages and perfected\r\nin prosperous times, had gradually been overthrown, first by the Persian\r\nand Greek conquests which weakened the national spirit, then by the Roman\r\nconquest which broke it, then by the prevalence of the Christian\r\ndoctrines, and lastly by the Mohammedan domination, more hostile than all\r\nthe others to sanitary precaution.\r\n\r\nPariset’s remaining argument was that ancient Egypt, by its systematic\r\ncare in providing for a slow mouldering of human and animal bodies beyond\r\nthe reach of the inundation, had been saved from the plague; in the\r\nhistoric period there had been epidemics, but these had been of typhus or\r\nother sickness of prisons, slavery, and famines. According to Herodotus,\r\nEgypt and Libya were the two healthiest countries under the sun. But when\r\nSt Paul’s vehement argument as to the natural and the spiritual body began\r\nto make way, when men began to ask the question, “How are the dead raised\r\nup, and with what body do they come?” the ancient practice of Egypt was\r\njudged to be out of harmony with Christian doctrine. Embalming was\r\ndenounced as sinful by St Anthony, the founder of Egyptian monachism, in\r\nthe third century; and by the time that the church of North Africa had\r\nreached its point of highest influence under St Augustine, bishop of\r\nHippo, the ancient religious rites of Egypt had everywhere given place to\r\nChristian burial[300]. Bubo-plague had already been prevalent in at least\r\none disastrous epidemic in Lower Egypt at the time of the great massacres\r\nof Christians in the episcopate of Cyprian; and in the year 542 it broke\r\nout at Pelusium, one of the uncleannest spots in the Delta, spread thence\r\non the one hand along the North African coast, and on the other hand by\r\nthe corn ships to Byzantium, and grew into the disastrous world-wide\r\npestilence which has ever since been associated with the reign of\r\nJustinian.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mohammedan conquest things went from bad to worse; and from the\r\ntenth century until the year 1846, plague had been domesticated on the\r\nsoil of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Pariset was communicated by him to the Académie de Médecine\r\non 12 July, 1831, and finally published in a carefully designed and highly\r\nfinished essay in 1837. It was received with much disfavour; according to\r\nhis colleague Daremberg, the learned librarian of the Academy, nothing but\r\nits brilliant style could have saved it from being forgotten in a week. It\r\nwas vigorously opposed by Clot Bey, on behalf of Egyptian officialdom,\r\nbecause it fixed upon Egypt the stigma of holding in the soil an inherent\r\nand abiding cause of the plague[301]. Besides the general objection that\r\nit was the theorizing of a _philosophe_, exception was taken to particular\r\nparts of the argument. Thus Labat demonstrated by arithmetic that the\r\nmummied carcases of all the generations of men and animals in Egypt for\r\nthree thousand years would have required a space as large as the whole of\r\nEgypt, which should thus have become one vast ossuary. And as to the fact,\r\nhe added, embalming was the privilege of the rich, and of some sacred\r\nspecies of animals. Clot Bey asserted that the whole class of slaves were\r\nnot thought worthy of embalming. He found also, in the language used by\r\nHerodotus, evidence that the people of Egypt felt themselves to be under\r\n“the continual menace” of some great epidemic scourge and took precautions\r\naccordingly--the very ground on which Pariset based his theory. The\r\nobjection which weighed most with Daremberg was the fact that, just about\r\nthe time when Pariset had asserted the immunity of Egypt from plague in\r\nher prosperous days, evidence had been found, in the newly-discovered\r\ncollections of Oribasius, that a bubonic disease was recorded for Egypt\r\nand Libya by a Greek physician two centuries before the Christian era, and\r\nby another Greek medical writer about the beginning of our era.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to have occurred to the opponents of Pariset’s theory\r\nthat the two chief objections, first that embalming was far from general,\r\nand second that cases of plague did occur in ancient Egypt, answered each\r\nother. But, as matter of fact, it can be shown that there were cheaper\r\nforms of embalming practised for the great mass of the people. Again, it\r\nwas found by De Maillet that bodies not embalmed at all, but laid in\r\ncoarse cloths upon beds of charcoal under six or eight feet of sand at an\r\nelevation on the edge of the great plain of mummies at Memphis, and beyond\r\nthe reach of the water, were as perfectly preserved from putrid decay as\r\nif they had been embalmed, the dry air and the nitrous soil contributing\r\nto their slow and inoffensive decomposition[302]. These facts tended to\r\nsupport the notion that it was not ceremony which really determined the\r\nnational practice, but utility, into which neither art nor religion\r\nnecessarily entered. The existence also of bubonic disease in the period\r\nof the Ptolemies proved that the risk assumed in Pariset’s theory was a\r\nreal risk, the precautions having been not always sufficient to meet it.\r\n\r\nThe plague which overran the known world in Justinian’s reign (542) was,\r\naccording to this theory, the effect on a grand scale of an equally grand\r\ncause, namely, the final overthrow of a most ancient religion and national\r\nlife, which had not been built up for nothing and had a true principle\r\nconcealed beneath its superstitions. The parallelism between China and\r\nancient Egypt has been a favourite subject. In China whatever of religion\r\nthere is runs upon the Egyptian lines--reverence for the dead or worship\r\nof ancestors. The Chinese do not indeed embalm their dead, but they\r\npractise an equivalent art of preservation which may be read in almost\r\nidentical terms in the book of Marco Polo and in modern works on the\r\nsocial life of China[303]. To prevent the products of cadaveric decay from\r\npassing into the soil may be said to be the object of their practices. The\r\npains taken to secure dry burial-places are especially obvious in those\r\nparts of the country, such as the “reed lands” of the Yang-tsi, which are\r\nsubject to inundations, annual or occasional[304]. Much of the national\r\nart of Feng-shui is concerned, under the mask of divination, with these\r\ncommon-sense aims.\r\n\r\nBoth Egypt and China are liable to have their river-basins flooded at one\r\ntime and parched to dust at another. These extreme fluctuations of the\r\nground water are now known to scientific research to be the cause of\r\npeculiar and unwholesome products of putrefaction in the soil: given a\r\nsoil charged with animal matters, the risk to those living upon it is in\r\nproportion to the range of fluctuation of the ground water. If it happen\r\nas an annual thing that the pores of the ground are now full of water, now\r\nfull of air, or if these extreme alternations be a common liability, then\r\na soil with the products of animal decomposition dispersed through it will\r\nbe always unwholesome, and unwholesome on a national scale. It is often\r\nheld that even vegetables rotting on the ground are pestiferous; Ambroise\r\nParé believed that the rotting carcase of a stranded whale caused an\r\noutbreak of bubo-plague at Genoa; but human decomposition is something\r\nspecial--at least for the living of the same species[305]. Most special of\r\nall is it when its gross and crude matters pass rapidly into the ground,\r\ngetting carried hither and thither by the movements of the ground water,\r\nand giving off those half-products of oxidation which the extreme\r\nalternations from air to water, or from water to air, in the pores of the\r\nground are known to favour. There may be nothing offensive to the sense,\r\nbut the emanations from such a soil will in all probability be poisonous\r\nor pestilent. In particular circumstances of locality the permeation or\r\nleavening of the soil with the products of organic decomposition produces\r\nAsiatic cholera; in still more special circumstances the result is yellow\r\nfever; in circumstances familiar enough to ourselves the result is typhoid\r\nfever, and probably also summer diarrhœa or British cholera. These are all\r\nsoil poisons. Bubo-plague also is a soil poison; and it is claimed as\r\nspecially related to the products of _cadaveric_ decomposition, diffused\r\nat large in such a soil as soil-poisons are ordinarily engendered in.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to subject that theory of the plague to the test of facts\r\nstill further. Thus bubo-plague dogged the steps of Mohammedan conquest\r\nfrom the first century after the Hegira, now in Syria when Damascus was\r\nthe capital, now in Irak when Bagdad was the centre of Mohammedan rule,\r\nnow in Egypt when the seat of empire shifted to Grand Cairo; and, over a\r\ngreat part of the period, simultaneously in all the regions of Islam. That\r\nlong series of plague-epidemics has been recorded in Arabic annals, and\r\nhas lately been published in an abstract accessible to all, with a summary\r\nof conclusions[306].\r\n\r\nWhat are the conclusions of the learned commentator on the Arabic annals,\r\nas to the general causes of the thousand years of Mohammedan\r\nplague?--“War, with the wasting of whole nations, in disregard of all\r\nestablished rights, with plundering of towns and concentration of great\r\nmasses of men ill provided for and unregulated, who developed the seeds of\r\ncommunicable and malignant diseases. Add to these things the negligent or\r\nwholly neglected burial of those who had fallen in battle, the straits and\r\nprivations of the wounded, and the effects of a hot climate, especially in\r\nflooded and swampy tracts of country.... The kind of burial, in very\r\nshallow and often badly covered graves, which used to be practised in most\r\nEastern towns, and in part is still practised, may also have had\r\ndisastrous consequences not unfrequently.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory tested by Modern Instances.\r\n\r\nWith that general statement for the long succession of plague-epidemics in\r\nIslam during nine centuries from the Hegira, beginning with a Syrian\r\nepidemic in A.D. 628 and ending with a close succession of twelve\r\nepidemics in Egypt from 1410 to 1492, we may pass to the more detailed\r\naccounts of the conditions under which bubo-plague has been found in\r\nvarious localities, often circumscribed spots far apart and out of the\r\nway, during recent years. These spots are so varied, have so little\r\napparently in common, and are so capriciously chosen in the midst of\r\ntheir several regions of the globe, that they do not readily fall into\r\nany order or classification. What are we to make of a few spots of plague\r\namong nomade Arabs of the Cyrenaic plateau; of plague in some stricken\r\nvillages high up in the highlands of Kurdistan, or in low-lying towns such\r\nas Resht, near the shore of the Caspian, or amidst the black ooze of\r\namphibious habitations in the lower valley of Tigris and Euphrates; of\r\ntrue bubonic disease in some few Bedouin villages or small towns on the\r\nsummits of the basaltic plateaus that rise like gigantic warts from the\r\nArabian desert; of bubo-plague in Yun-nan, at or near the capital Talifoo,\r\nwhere the Mohammedan and Chinese influences have been struggling for\r\nmastery, as well as among the cabins in the rocky valleys of the Salwen;\r\nof some forty or fifty Himalayan hamlets picked out as plague-spots among\r\nthe six thousand villages of Kumaon; and of the now extinct but\r\ncomparatively recent centres of the same disease in the walled towns and\r\nwalled villages of Kutch, Kattiwar, and Marwar? And lastly what are we to\r\nmake of those cases of typhus fever with buboes which have been observed\r\nin villages of the Yusufzai valley, near Peshawur, in 1852; in the Chinese\r\ntown of Pakhoi, on the gulf of Tonking, in 1886; occasionally among the\r\nfever-cases in Burdwan since the health of that province underwent so\r\ndisastrous a change about the year 1870; and, on credible report, among\r\nthe troops in the Russo-Turkish war of 1879? It is surely unnecessary, at\r\nleast, to refute the sterile dogmatism that these are all the effects of\r\none pre-existing virus, carried, we know not how, from point to point of\r\nthe globe in an unbroken succession. It is a far cry even on a small-scale\r\nmap from Kumaon to Kutch, from Yun-nan to the Gulf of Tonking, from Resht\r\nto the Armenian highlands, from the centre of Arabia to Tripoli, and from\r\nMesopotamia to North Yemen. And what is the use of assuming that there has\r\nalways been bubo-plague in the “cradle of the human race,” and concluding\r\nthat the Black Death was one of its excursions westwards, so long as the\r\nplagues of Islam were going on from decade to decade, all through the\r\nMiddle Ages, at no great distance from Byzantium and from Western Europe?\r\nAre not Damascus, Bagdad and Grand Cairo of more account as plague-foci\r\nthan a few villages in the Himalaya or in Kattiwar, even granting that the\r\nplague may have been in the latter at an earlier date than we know? It is\r\nnot communication that connects the several seats of plague, scattered\r\nwidely in time and place; but it is community of conditions, or of the\r\ncauses and associated circumstances which breed the plague in each\r\nseparately. Let us take them in some sort of order.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable habitats of modern bubo-plague are the villages\r\non the basalt plateaus of the Arabian desert. We have information of these\r\nplague-spots from Doughty[307], who did not indeed visit Assir, the most\r\nnotorious of them, but several others more to the north and east. He\r\ndescribes the ruined villages of Mogug, Gofar, Hâyil and others, where the\r\npeople had died of plague some years before. A year of dearth preceded the\r\nplague in some, if not in all of them. The author is struck by the\r\ncarelessness of burial, or the difficulties of it in the baked soil,\r\nalthough he does not directly connect that with the epidemics. Thus, in\r\npassing the graveyard of Hâyil, one of the plague-towns, he remarks:\r\n“Aheyd was a man of much might and glory in his day; he lies a yard under\r\nthe squalid gravel in his shirt.” Of Kheybar, with vague traditions of\r\nplague, he says: “We passed through a burial-ground of black volcanic\r\nmould and salt-warp; the squalid grave heaps are marked with headstones of\r\nwild basalt. That funeral earth is chapped and ghastly, bulging over her\r\nenwombed corses, like a garden soil in spring-time which is pushed by the\r\nnew spring plants. All is horror at Kheybar!” He is led to the following\r\ngeneral remarks: “The care of sepulture was beyond measure in the\r\nreligions of antiquity, which were without humility. Under the new\r\nreligion [of Arabia] the deceased is wound in a shirt-cloth of calico, and\r\nhis corse is laid in the shallow pit of droughty earth.” Again, of Bedouin\r\nburials in general: “The deceased is buried the same day or on the morrow.\r\nThey scrape out painfully with a stick and their hands in the hard-burned\r\nsoil a shallow grave. I have seen their graves in the desert ruined by\r\nfoul hyenas, and their winding-sheets lay half above ground.”\r\n\r\nOf the best known of these Arabian plague-spots the plateau of Assir, to\r\nthe south-east of Mecca, we have the following information relating to the\r\nyears 1874-79[308]; the chief plague-locality is Namasse, the principal\r\ntown of Beny Sheir, with five other villages.\r\n\r\n    The site is on a mountain ridge too high for camels, the climate is\r\n    cold and moist, the soil fruitful, springs abundant, and no standing\r\n    water. The houses are built of stone, and stand close together. The\r\n    ground-floor of each house is used as the stable; and as the winter in\r\n    these mountains is very severe, so that water freezes, the inhabitants\r\n    live with their cattle in a horrible state of filth. According to\r\n    information from the district superintendent, there had been plague in\r\n    a few villages every two or three years for the previous thirty-five\r\n    or forty years. It has seldom extended further than five or six\r\n    leagues. The region is a mountain canton, with no trade; it is cut off\r\n    from the rest of the world. The disease is mostly attended with buboes\r\n    in the groins, armpits, and neck, but not always; sometimes petechial\r\n    spots were spoken of; in the sheikh Faïk’s own household the disease\r\n    began with rigors, and developed buboes, petechiæ, headache and\r\n    burning thirst. Dr Nury counted up in six villages, with a population\r\n    of eight hundred, cases of plague to the number of 184 (68 men, 45\r\n    women, 50 boys and 21 girls), with 155 deaths and 29 recoveries.\r\n\r\nLet us now place beside this the accounts of the plague in the mountains\r\nvillage of Kumaon[309].\r\n\r\nOf the plague-villages of Danpore and Munsharee, near the snow, we read:\r\n\r\n    “Their houses are generally built of stone, one storey high. On the\r\n    ground-floor herd the cattle; in this compartment the dung is allowed\r\n    to accumulate till such time as there is no room left for the cattle\r\n    to stand erect; it is then removed and carefully packed close around\r\n    all sides, so that the house literally stands in the centre of a\r\n    hot-bed.... In many instances we have seen it accumulated above the\r\n    level of the floor of the upper story in which the family lives.” In\r\n    that compartment, four feet high, with no window and a door of some\r\n    three feet by eighteen inches, ten or fifteen people live, lying\r\n    huddled together with the door shut. Their food is as poor as their\r\n    lodging. When plague breaks out, the family ties are rudely loosened:\r\n    those who can, flee to the jungle, leaving the stricken to their fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following is by Renny: “Fourteen died at a place in the forest\r\n    half a mile or more from Duddoli, respecting which I had the best\r\n    description yet given to me of the career of the sickness. Here were\r\n    only two houses, or long low huts, occupied by two separate families,\r\n    the heads being two brothers, sixteen souls in all. These two huts had\r\n    to contain also thirty head of cattle, large and small, at the worst\r\n    season of the year. In these two huts the Mahamurree [bubo-plague]\r\n    commenced about ten or eleven months ago, corresponding to the time it\r\n    appeared in Duddoli. At this place the sixteen residents kept together\r\n    till fourteen died, and one adult only, a man of about thirty years of\r\n    age, with his female child of six years old, survived. There was no\r\n    particular disorder among the cattle, but the outbreak of the plague\r\n    was preceded and accompanied by a great mortality among the rats in\r\n    their houses.”\r\n\r\nLet us now take the accounts, twenty-five years later, of the plague in\r\nthe same district in 1876-77[310].\r\n\r\n    Confirming the earlier statements as to the extraordinary filth of the\r\n    houses--the cattle under the same roof and the baskets of damp and\r\n    unripe grain--he directs attention specially to the disposal of the\r\n    dead. The custom of the country is to burn the body beside the most\r\n    convenient mountain stream terminating in the Ganges. But from that\r\n    good practice the people have deviated in regard to bodies dead of any\r\n    pestilence (smallpox, cholera, plague), which are buried. Of all\r\n    countries the Himalaya is least suited to the burial of the dead. For,\r\n    by reason of the rocky subsoil, it is seldom possible to dig a grave\r\n    more than two feet deep; and, as a rule, the pestilent dead are laid\r\n    in shallow trenches in the surface soil of the field nearest to the\r\n    place of death, or of the terrace facing the house, or even of the\r\n    floor of the house itself. This bad practice is begotten of fear to\r\n    handle the body, and has been long established. Such mismanagement of\r\n    the dead is sufficient to account for the continuous existence of the\r\n    active principle of plague-disease, sometimes dormant for want of\r\n    opportunity, but ever ready to affect persons suitably prepared by any\r\n    cause producing a low or bad state of health. In the houses of\r\n    families about to suffer from an outbreak of plague, rats are\r\n    sometimes found dead on the floor. Planck had seen them himself; all\r\n    that he had seen appeared to have died suddenly, as by suffocation,\r\n    their bodies being in good condition, a piece of rag sometimes\r\n    clenched in the teeth. He mentions nine villages, all of them endemic\r\n    seats of plague, in which the premonitory death of rats in the\r\n    infected houses was testified. The affected villages were not one in a\r\n    hundred of all the villages of Kumaon, and were widely scattered\r\n    throughout the northern half of the province. Even in each of those\r\n    few villages, the plague is confined to one house, or one terrace, or\r\n    one portion of the village.\r\n\r\nLet us turn next to the small spots of bubo-plague in the remote province\r\nof Yun-nan. Our information comes from members of the British and French\r\nConsular services[311].\r\n\r\n    The plague occurs in towns and villages and is the cause of much\r\n    mortality. After ravaging villages scattered about the plains, it\r\n    frequently ascends the mountains, and takes off many of the aborigines\r\n    inhabiting the high lands. What, in M. Rocher’s opinion, aggravates\r\n    the evil is the practice of not burying the bodies of those who die of\r\n    this disease. Instead of being buried, the body is placed on a bier\r\n    and exposed to the sun. As a consequence of this practice the\r\n    traveller passing the outskirts of a village where the plague is\r\n    raging is nearly choked with the nauseous smell emanating from the\r\n    exposed and rotting corpses. Burial is the usual mode of disposal,\r\n    although many of the villages are on rocky mountain sides, as in\r\n    Kumaon. The rats are first affected; as soon as they sicken, they\r\n    leave their holes in troops, and after staggering about and falling\r\n    over each other, drop down dead. Mr Baber had the same information\r\n    from a French missionary in the upper valley of the Salwen, a long,\r\n    low valley about two miles broad, walled in by immense precipices, so\r\n    hot in summer that the inhabitants go up the hill sides to live. The\r\n    approach of bubo-plague (the buboes may be as large as a hen’s or\r\n    goose’s egg) may often be known from the extraordinary behaviour of\r\n    the rats, who leave their holes and crevices and issue on to the\r\n    floors without a trace of their accustomed timidity, springing\r\n    continually upwards from their hind legs as if they were trying to\r\n    jump out of something. The rats fall dead, and then comes the turn of\r\n    the poultry, pigs, goats, etc. The good father had a theory of his own\r\n    that the plague is really a pestilential emanation slowly rising in an\r\n    equable stratum from the ground, the smallest creatures being first\r\n    engulfed. The larger plague-centre at or near the capital, Talifoo,\r\n    appears to be related to Mohammedan warfare, and possibly to the\r\n    neglect to bury the dead, which is an admitted fact, although not\r\n    connected by the narrator with the prevalence of plague.\r\n\r\nThe other Chinese plague-spot is hundreds of miles away, on the shores of\r\nthe Gulf of Tonking. The best known centre of plague is the port of\r\nPakhoi, the native quarter of which is described as peculiarly filthy. The\r\nhouses are little cleaner than the streets, the floors being saturated\r\nwith excrement, and the drains being either close to the surface or open\r\naltogether. An outbreak of plague there in 1882 is minutely described by\r\nDr Lowry[312].\r\n\r\n    It occurred in the hot weather of June (85° Fahr. day, 76° Fahr.\r\n    night); for fear of thieves the houses are carefully shut up even on\r\n    the hottest night. The epidemic caused about 400 to 500 deaths in a\r\n    population of 25,000. The disease does not spread. In nearly every\r\n    house where the disease broke out, the rats had been coming out of\r\n    their holes and dying on the floors: Dr Lowry dissected several of\r\n    them, and found the lungs congested. In the human subject, except for\r\n    the buboes, the disease resembled typhus: “anyone going to the bedside\r\n    of a patient would certainly at first think it was that disease he had\r\n    to deal with.” The same disease occurred at Lien-chow, a city twelve\r\n    miles off. Another English physician in the service of the China\r\n    Maritime Customs heard of a malady with the symptoms of plague in\r\n    certain districts of Southern Kiangsi in the autumn of 1886; but no\r\n    particulars were to be had. Typhus was prevalent, and very fatal,\r\n    every year in the towns, villages and hamlets of Northern Kiangsi.\r\n\r\n    One curious piece of evidence as to the death of rats, not associated\r\n    with plague in men, comes from a more northern province of China. In\r\n    the autumn of 1881, on the opposite side of the Yang-tsi from Nanking\r\n    and in the western suburbs of the ancient capital, the rats emerged\r\n    from holes in dwellings, jumped up, turned round, and fell dead.\r\n    Baskets and boxes filled with their bodies were cast into the canal.\r\n    “Here,” says Dr Macgowan, “was evidently a subsoil poison which\r\n    affected the animals precisely in the same way as the malaria of the\r\n    Yun-nan pest. Happily the subterranean miasm at Nanking did not affect\r\n    animals that live above ground[313].”\r\n\r\nThe evidence from Kutch, Kattiwar, and Marwar relates to the years\r\n1815-20, and 1838. In circumstances peculiar in some respects, namely, of\r\nwalled towns and stockaded villages, but the same as those already given\r\nin the matter of filth from cattle crowded into the human dwellings, we\r\nfind bubo-plague breaking out so long as the unwholesome state of things\r\nlasted under Mahratta rule and until British rule had been fairly at work.\r\nThe causes of the bubo-plague, says Whyte, were the same as of\r\ntyphus--walled and crowded towns, cattle housed with human beings, slow\r\nwasting diseases among the cattle, which were not killed for food but\r\nkept for milk and ghee. He questions whether, in shutting out their\r\nenemies, they had not shut in one far more powerful[314]. Here also we\r\nhave various independent witnesses[315] testifying to the premonitory\r\ndeath of the rats; they lay dead in all places and directions--in the\r\nstreets, houses, and hiding-places of the walls. This happened in every\r\ntown that was affected in Marwar, so that the inhabitants of any house\r\ninstantly quitted it on seeing a dead rat.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of Typhus to Bubo-plague.\r\n\r\nThe smallest and the most easily surveyed of all the recent foci of\r\nbubo-plague, is that among the Bedouin of the Cyrenaic plateau in North\r\nAfrica (port of Benghazi), a desert region corresponding to one of the\r\nmost famous corn-lands of antiquity.\r\n\r\n    There was no difference of opinion that the small outbreak of plague\r\n    in 1874 began simultaneously in the tents of Orphas and the tents of\r\n    Ferig-el-Hanan, containing together about a hundred souls[316]. These\r\n    Arabs keep cows, sheep and goats; some of them also cultivate small\r\n    patches of corn. They are subject to periodic famines, and there had\r\n    been much want among them in 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872 and 1873, attended\r\n    by epidemics of typhus, cholera and smallpox. In the winter they found\r\n    employment among the traders of Merdjé, and at the end of March, 1873,\r\n    had quitted that village to place their animals in the neighbouring\r\n    hill-pastures. The ground had been saturated, after long drought, by\r\n    the rains of the winter. Their tents are pitched in hollows which may\r\n    be filled by water in a few minutes. The encampments, like those of\r\n    the Bedouin in Arabia, are excessively filthy and are often the scene\r\n    of typhus fever. In April, 1874, the plague began, the first case\r\n    being in a child; the buboes were in the groin, armpit or neck. The\r\n    other symptoms were bilious vomiting, black vomit, haematemesis,\r\n    petechiae, anthraceous boils, pains in the head, collapse, and\r\n    delirium. A few cases were mild, but the majority grave and fatal; in\r\n    several cases there was a relapse with new buboes. The disease was\r\n    brought from the tents to the village of Merdjé, in which 270 were\r\n    attacked in a population of 310, with 100 deaths. The total known\r\n    attacks from 5 April to 24 July were 533 in a population of 734, with\r\n    208 deaths and 325 recoveries, 201 resisting the infection. The\r\n    sanitary state of the village was as bad as that of the tents: the\r\n    houses, entered by a low door, had windows not to the sun, but to the\r\n    courtyard, which is a stable choked with filth; the floors of the\r\n    houses are covered with filth. The graveyard is in the centre of the\r\n    village, beside a pool of standing water: the graves are shallow, and\r\n    the corpses are sometimes unearthed by jackals. Both in the village\r\n    and in the encampments a fall of rain was followed by a new series of\r\n    attacks. The advice of the sanitary commisioner was to make graves at\r\n    least six feet deep, and to cover them with lime.\r\n\r\nThese events in 1874 were an exact repetition of those of 1858. In both\r\nyears heavy rains followed long drought, giving promise of an abundant\r\nharvest after a period of famine. The dry years, in both instances, were\r\nattended with sickness, typhus and other; the first wet season turned the\r\nsickness to plague, that is to say, it added the complication of buboes\r\nand haemorrhagic symptoms to the characters of typhus. The meaning of that\r\nseems to be that the saturation of the ground generated a soil-poison\r\nwhere there had previously been the milder aerial poison of typhus. This\r\nview of plague, as a typhus of the soil, or a disease made so much more\r\nmalignant than typhus just because of underground fermentation of the\r\nputrescible animal matters, is borne out by the facts already given for\r\nChina and for India. The latter country furnishes other illustrations of\r\ntyphus fever becoming complicated with buboes, and so becoming something\r\nlike plague. Perhaps the best instance is the fever observed in the\r\nYusufzai valley, near Peshawur, in 1852[317].\r\n\r\n    It arose mostly in the filthy Mohammedan houses, shared by cattle and\r\n    human beings; but it invaded some of the cleaner Hindoo houses also.\r\n    The disease began in low, marshy situations, which were covered with\r\n    water after rain and heavy night dews. It was of the type of typhus,\r\n    or relapsing fever, with yellowness of the skin, bleeding from the\r\n    gums, and from the bowels, and often from the nose. One of the\r\n    observers says: “The only other concomitant affection worthy of note\r\n    is swelling of the lymphatic glands over various parts of the body;\r\n    this, however, is only met with in a very few instances.” The other\r\n    authority says: “Inflammation and suppuration of the glands in the\r\n    groin, axilla, and neck occurred in some that survived the first or\r\n    second relapse.” To this outbreak, which is removed only in degree\r\n    from the Benghazi plague, the Pakhoi plague, and the Pali plague\r\n    (Gujerat), may be added some others, about which the information is\r\n    more general. Thus, the fevers which have become notorious in Burdwan\r\n    since the health of that province changed so disastrously owing to the\r\n    damming of the ground-water, are said to have been attended now and\r\n    then with buboes. The typhus fever at Saugor in 1859 was occasionally\r\n    complicated with suppuration of the lymphatic glands: “In the Doab, as\r\n    in the subsequent gaol attack, the glands in the groin were very\r\n    rarely affected; those in the neck were more frequently affected, but\r\n    this was not a prominent feature in the disease[318].” Again, General\r\n    Loris Melikoff told the correspondent of the _Golos_ that twenty men\r\n    died in a day in the Russo-Turkish war in the winter of 1878, with\r\n    glandular swellings; everywhere there was Schmutz, Schmutz! And\r\n    lastly, in the epidemic of 1878 at Vetlianka, on the Volga, which is\r\n    reckoned among the historic occurrences of bubo-plague in Europe, the\r\n    first ten cases in November, 1878, had suppurating glands in the\r\n    axilla, did not take to bed, and recovered; there had been ordinary\r\n    typhus in the filthy fisher cottages in 1877, and there was typhus\r\n    concurrent with the disease which at length became, and was at length\r\n    recognized as, true bubo-plague in the winter of 1878-79[319].\r\n\r\nOne thing which distinguishes these recent outbreaks of plague from the\r\ngreat plague of Justinian’s reign, in part from the series of Mohammedan\r\nplagues, and from the Black Death, is that they have for the most part\r\nshown no independent vitality and no diffusive power. As in typhus fever\r\nitself (except on great occasions), they have been almost confined to\r\nthose who lived in the filthy houses, and to those who came within the\r\ninfluence of the pestilential emanations. The great plagues of the 6th and\r\n14th centuries had, on the other hand, a diffusive power which carried\r\nthem over the whole known world. The buboes of Egypt and of China became\r\nfamiliar as far as Norway and Greenland.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from diffusiveness, the conditions of recent local plagues are\r\nnot unlike those of the great historical epidemics. The very same\r\nobservation of the rats leaving their holes, which is so abundantly\r\nconfirmed from the recent plague-spots of Southern China, of Yun-nan, of\r\nKumaon, and of Gujerat, was familiar in the plague-books of London and of\r\nEdinburgh in the Elizabethan period. Of the great outbreak in 1603, Thomas\r\nLodge writes: “And when as rats, moules, and other creatures (accustomed\r\nto live underground) forsake their holes and habitations, it is a token of\r\ncorruption in the same, by reason that such sorts of creatures forsake\r\ntheir wonted places of aboade[320].” That is only one of many proofs that\r\nthe virus of plague has its habitat in the soil, although it may be\r\ncarried long distances clinging to other things. In its most diffusive\r\npotency it is a soil-poison generated, we may now say with some\r\nconfidence, out of the products of cadaveric decay[321]; in its less\r\ndiffusive but hardly less malignant potency, it is a soil-poison generated\r\nout of the filth of cattle housed with human beings, or out of domestic\r\nfilth generally, and in nearly all the known instances of such generation,\r\nassociated with, but perhaps not absolutely dependent upon, carelessness\r\nin the disposal of the dead after famine or fever; in the least malignant\r\nform, when plague is only a small part of an epidemic of typhus and with\r\nthe buboes inclined to suppurate, it appears to be still a soil-poison,\r\nand to differ from typhus itself, just because the pestilential product of\r\ndecomposing filth has been engendered in the pores of the ground, rather\r\nthan in the atmosphere of living-rooms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Black Death, which here concerns us immediately, is one of the two\r\ngreat instances of a plague-virus with vast diffusive power, enormous\r\nmomentum, and centuries of endurance. So great effects may be said to\r\npostulate adequate causes; and one must assume that the virus had been\r\nbred from cadaveric decomposition in circumstances of peculiar\r\naggravation and on some vast or national scale. The sequence of events\r\ncarries us to China; and the annals of China do furnish evidence that the\r\nassumed cause was there on a vast scale through a long period of national\r\ndisaster, while the national customs of China for the disposal of the\r\ndead, like those of ancient Egypt, point to the existence of a real risk\r\nfrom allowing the soil to be permeated at large by the crude or hasty\r\nproducts of cadaveric decomposition.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty to construct the best hypothesis we can, sparing no labour.\r\nNo one really dispenses with theory, whatever his protestations to the\r\ncontrary; those who are the loudest professors of suspended judgment are\r\nthe most likely to fall victims to some empty verbalism which hangs loose\r\nat both ends, some ill-considered piece of argument which ignores the\r\nhistorical antecedents and stops short of the concrete conclusions. It has\r\nbeen so in the case of infective diseases, and of bubo-plague in\r\nparticular. The virus of the plague, we are told, is specific; it has\r\nexisted from an unknown antiquity, and has come down in an unbroken\r\nsuccession; we can no more discover how it arose, than we can tell how the\r\nfirst man arose, or the first mollusc, or the first moss or lichen; its\r\nspecies is, indeed, of the nature of the lowest vegetable organisms.\r\n\r\nThe objection to that hypothesis of plague is that it involves a total\r\ndisregard of facts. It is a mere formula, which saves all trouble,\r\ndispenses with all historical inquiry, and appears to be adapted equally\r\nto popular apprehension and to academic ease. The bubo-plagues of history\r\nhave not, in fact, been all of the same descent; notably the Black Death\r\nwas a wave of pestilence which Mohammedan countries, accustomed as they\r\nhad been to native bubo-plagues for centuries before, recognized as an\r\ninvasion from a foreign source, as an interruption of the sequence of\r\ntheir own plagues. Again, the attempt to link in one series the various\r\nscattered and circumscribed spots of plague now or lately existing must\r\nfail disastrously the moment it is seriously attempted. The hypothesis of\r\none single source of the plague, of a species of disease arising we know\r\nnot how, beginning we know not when or where, but at all events reproduced\r\nby ordinary generation in an unbroken series of cases, _ab aevo, ab ovo_,\r\nis the merest verbalism, wanting in reality or concreteness, and dictated\r\nby the curious illusion that a species of disease, because it reproduces\r\nitself after its kind, must resemble in other respects a species of living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe diffusive power of the virus of the Black Death, which has been\r\nequalled only by that of the plague in Justinian’s reign, may seem to have\r\ndepended upon the favouring conditions that it met with. But although\r\nfavouring conditions count for much, they are not all. The Black Death\r\nraged as furiously as anywhere among the nomade Tartars who were its first\r\nvictims; the virus, as soon as it was let loose, put forth a degree of\r\nvirulence which must have been native to it, or brought with it from its\r\nplace of engendering. None the less the incidence of the Black Death in\r\nEurope had depended in part upon the preparedness of the soil. It came to\r\nEurope in the age of feudalism and of walled towns, with a cramped and\r\nunwholesome manner of life, and inhabited spots of ground choked with the\r\nwaste matters of generations. But even amidst these generally fostering\r\nconditions, there would have been more special things that determined its\r\nelection. It is a principle exemplified in all importations of disease\r\nfrom remote sources, in smallpox among the aerial contagions and in\r\nAsiatic cholera among the soil-poisons, that the conditions which favour\r\ndiffusion abroad are approximately the same amidst which the infection had\r\nbeen originally engendered. A soil-poison of foreign origin makes straight\r\nfor the most likely spots in the line of its travels; it may not, and\r\noften does not confine itself to these, but it gives them a preference.\r\nThus, if we conclude on the evidence that the bubo-plague is a soil-poison\r\nhaving a special affinity to the products of cadaveric decomposition, we\r\nshall understand why the Black Death, when it came to England, found so\r\ncongenial a soil in the monasteries, and in the homes of the clergy.\r\nWithin the monastery walls, under the floor of the chapel or cloisters,\r\nwere buried not only generations of monks, but often the bodies of\r\nprinces, of notables of the surrounding country, and of great\r\necclesiastics. In every parish the house of the priest would have stood\r\nclose to the church and the churchyard. One has to figure the virus of the\r\nBlack Death not so much as carried by individuals from place to place in\r\ntheir persons, or in their clothes and effects, but rather as a leaven\r\nwhich had passed into the ground, spreading hither and thither therein as\r\nif by polarizing the adjacent particles of the soil, and that not\r\ninstantaneously like a physical force, but so gradually as to occupy a\r\nwhole twelvemonth between Dorset and Yorkshire. Sooner or later it reached\r\nto every corner of the land, manifesting its presence wherever there were\r\npeople resident. Such universality in the soil of England, we have reason\r\nto think, it had. But it appears to have put forth its greatest power in\r\nthe walled town, in the monastery, and in the neighbourhood of the village\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nENGLAND AFTER THE BLACK DEATH, WITH THE EPIDEMICS TO THE TUDOR PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great mortality came to an end everywhere in England by Michaelmas,\r\n1349. The pestilence had lasted some fourteen months, from its first\r\nappearance on the Dorset coast at the beginning of August, 1348, until its\r\nsubsidence in the northern counties in the autumn of 1349. It came to an\r\nend, as all devastating epidemics do, through having spent its force,\r\nexhausted its pabulum, run through all the susceptible subjects. A\r\nletter-writer of Charles I.’s reign has put into colloquial language the\r\ncorresponding reason for a pause in the ravages of the plague towards the\r\nend of its stay in London: “And I think the only reason why the plague is\r\nsomewhat slackened is because the place is dead already, and no bodie left\r\nin it worth the killing[322].” The exhausted state of the country, and of\r\nall Europe, is not easy for us to realize. Petrarch, a witness of the\r\nBlack Death in Italy, foresaw the incredulity of after ages, or their\r\ninability to image the state of things--the empty houses, the abandoned\r\ntowns, the squalid country, the fields crowded with the dead, the vast and\r\ndreadful solitude over the whole world. If you inquire of historians, he\r\ncontinues, they are silent; if you consult the physicians, they are at\r\ntheir wits’ end; if you question the philosophers, they shrug their\r\nshoulders, wrinkle their brows, and lay the finger on the lip. Is it\r\npossible that posterity can believe these things? For we who have seen\r\nthem can hardly believe them[323].\r\n\r\nThe blow fell upon every country of Europe within a period of two or three\r\nyears; and it must have paralysed all trade and industry, war and\r\npolitics, for the time being. Edward III.’s wars in France, which had\r\nresulted in the victory of Crecy in 1346 and the conquest of Calais in\r\n1347, had been suspended by a truce, which was renewed from time to time.\r\nThus, in the very midst of the pestilence, on the 2nd of May, 1349, the\r\nenvoys of the English and French kings, “in their tents between Calais and\r\nGuines,” agreed upon a form of treaty continuing the truce until\r\nPentecost, 1350[324]. In the last days of 1349, Edward III. in person,\r\nwith a small force, was able to repel an attack upon his new possession of\r\nCalais[325]. It was in the year after the Black Death (1350) according to\r\nboth Stow and Selden, that Edward III. held a great feast at Windsor, to\r\nwhich his heralds invited knights from abroad, to celebrate the\r\ninstitution of the Order of the Garter, the statutes of the Order having\r\nbeen drawn up the year before. What is styled “the necessary defence of\r\nthe realm,” was a chief subject of concern throughout the year 1350. On\r\nthe 12th February an order was made to the sheriffs of counties for a\r\nsupply of so many arrows from each[326]. On the 20th March the mayors and\r\nbailiffs of 110 towns are ordered to provide their respective quotas of\r\nmen-at-arms--London 100, Norwich 60, Bristol 20, and so on--and to send\r\nthem to Sandwich “for the necessary defence of our realm[327].” On the 1st\r\nof May a commission was issued to engage mariners for certain ships, and\r\non the 20th May, an order for ships, pinnaces and barges.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd July and 10th August there are proclamations relating to the\r\npiratical fleet of Spanish ships, intercepting the English traders to\r\nGascony, and threatening an invasion of England[328]; the Spaniards were\r\nrouted, their ships taken, and the Channel cleared, in a famous\r\nengagement off Winchelsea, on 29th August, 1350, which the king directed\r\nin person[329]. On 15th June, three days before the first of the\r\nordinances against the Labourers, the king issued two orders to counties,\r\nto raise men “for our passage against the parts over sea”--one to the\r\nWelsh lords, and the other to the sheriffs of English counties, the\r\ndemands being in all for 4170 bowmen from England, and for 1350 men from\r\nWales[330]. Whatever these edicts may have resulted in, it was not until\r\nfour years after that the king really resumed his wars with France. On the\r\n8th September, 1355, the Black Prince sailed from Plymouth with a fleet of\r\nsome three hundred ships carrying an army of knights, men-at-arms, English\r\nbowmen and Welshmen, to the Garonne, for his famous raid across the south\r\nof France[331]. Later in the autumn the king collected at Portsmouth[332]\r\nand Sandwich, and at Calais, a force of three thousand men-at-arms, two\r\nthousand mounted bowmen, and an immense number of bowmen on foot, with\r\nwhich he took the field on the 2nd November[333]. The same summer, a fleet\r\nof forty great ships was fitted out at Rotherhithe, for a force of foot\r\nunder Henry, duke of Lancaster, to aid the king of Navarre; it sailed on\r\nthe 10th of July, but was unable to clear the Channel, and for various\r\nreasons did not proceed[334]; next year, however, the duke of Lancaster\r\ncrossed from Southampton to Normandy with a force in forty-eight\r\nships[335].\r\n\r\nThus was the war with France resumed six years after the great mortality.\r\nThe means for equipping these expeditions had been provided by loans\r\nraised on the security of the enormous subsidy which the Parliament of\r\n1353-54 was induced to vote, in the form of an export duty of fifty\r\nshillings on every sack of wool shipped to foreign countries during the\r\nnext six years. According to Avesbury’s calculation, Edward had a revenue,\r\nfrom that source, of a thousand marks a day; it was the common opinion, he\r\nsays, that more than 100,000 sacks of wool were exported in a year[336].\r\nBut another and perhaps better authority gives the annual export of wool\r\nin the middle of the fourteenth century at nearly 32,000 sacks[337].\r\n\r\n\r\nDirect effects of the Black Death.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile internal affairs were demanding the king’s attention, although\r\nthey occupy less space in the extant State papers than the warlike\r\npreparations. On the 23rd August, while the mortality was raging in the\r\nnorth, a proclamation was issued to the sheriff of Northumberland against\r\nthe migration of people to Scotland, with arms, victuals, goods and\r\nmerchandise, the pestilence not being mentioned[338]. The first State\r\npaper which relates to the recent great mortality is the king’s\r\nproclamation of 1st December, 1349, to the mayor and bailiffs of Sandwich,\r\nand of forty-eight other English ports, including London[339]. The\r\nproclamation begins:\r\n\r\n    “Forasmuch as no mean part of the people of our realm of England is\r\n    dead in the present pestilence, and the treasure of the said realm is\r\n    mostly exhausted, and (as we have learned) numbers of this our kingdom\r\n    are daily passing, or proposing to pass, to parts over sea with money\r\n    which they were able to have kept within the realm, Now we, taking\r\n    heed that if passage after this manner be tolerated, the kingdom will\r\n    in a short time be stripped both of men and of treasure, and so\r\n    therefrom grave danger may easily arise to us and to the said realm,\r\n    unless a fitting remedy be speedily appointed--do command the mayor\r\n    and bailiffs of Sandwich (and of forty-eight other ports) to stop the\r\n    passage beyond sea of them that have no mandate, especially if they be\r\n    Englishmen, excepting merchants, notaries, or the king’s envoys.”\r\n\r\nThe edict was probably directed more against the drain of treasure than\r\nagainst the emigration of people; but this not uninteresting question\r\nreally belongs to other historians, who do not appear to have dealt with\r\nit[340].\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June, 1350, the first summer after the mortality, there was\r\nissued the first proclamation, to the sheriffs of counties, on the demands\r\nof the labourers and artificers for higher wages, entitled “De magna parte\r\npopuli in ultima pestilentia defuncta, et de servientium salariis proinde\r\nmoderandis[341].” The preamble or motive is one that cannot but seem\r\nstrange to modern ideas, although it must have been correct and\r\nconventional according to feudal notions: “Forasmuch as some, having\r\nregard to the necessities of lords and to the scarcity of servants, are\r\nunwilling to serve unless they receive excessive wages, while others\r\nprefer to beg in idleness, rather than to seek their living by labour--be\r\nit therefore enacted that any man or woman, bond or free, under the age of\r\nsixty, and not living by a trade or handicraft, nor possessing private\r\nmeans, nor having land to cultivate, shall be obliged, when required, to\r\nserve any master who is willing to hire him or her at such wages as were\r\nusually paid in the locality in the year 1346, or on the average of five\r\nor six years preceding; provided that the lords of villeins or tenants\r\nshall have the preference of their labour, so that they retain no more\r\nthan shall be necessary for them.” It was strictly forbidden either to\r\noffer or to demand wages above the old rate. Another clause forbids the\r\ngiving of alms to beggars. Handicraftsmen of various kinds are also\r\nordered to be paid at the old rate. Lastly, victuallers and other traders\r\nare directed to sell their wares at reasonable prices[342]. The same\r\nordinance, with some added paragraphs, was reissued on the 18th November,\r\n1350, to the county of Suffolk and to the district of Lindsey\r\n(Lincolnshire), the latter being one of the chief sheep-grazing parts of\r\nEngland; in those two localities, it is stated in so many words, the\r\nlabourers had set at nought the ordinance of 18th June[343]. When\r\nParliament met--for the first time since the mortality--on the 9th of\r\nFebruary, 1351, it was acknowledged that the commissions to sheriffs\r\nissued by the king and his council had been ineffective, and that wages\r\nhad been at twice or thrice the old rate[344]. The Parliament, having\r\nlegislated for a number of technical matters in connexion with the\r\nenormous number of wills and successions, proceeded next to the labour\r\nquestion, and passed the famous Statute of Labourers, by which the\r\ngeneralities of the ordinance of 18th June, 1350, are replaced by an\r\nelaborate schedule of wages for harvest-time and other times[345]. One\r\nclause of the Act is specially directed against the migration of labourers\r\nto other counties. It was the ancient manorial system that was threatened\r\nmost of all by the depopulation. The surviving labourers sought work where\r\nthey could command the best wages, and at the same time could escape from\r\nthe few degrading bonds of servitude which still clung to the _nativi_ or\r\nserfs of a manor. But the Manor Court was still the unit of government,\r\nand the Act would have been inoperative except on that basis. That\r\nfundamental intention of the statute of the 9th February, 1351, comes out,\r\nnot only in the explicit clause against migrations, but also by contrast,\r\nin the special permission given to the labourers of the counties of\r\nStafford, Derby and Lancaster, to the people of Craven, and to the\r\ndwellers in the Marches of Wales and Scotland, to go about in search of\r\nwork in harvest “as they were wont to do before this time[346].”\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the depopulation had been to mobilise, as it were,\r\nthe labouring class. Many of them must have taken the road at once; for,\r\nin the first ordinance of 18th June, 1350, before the harvest of that year\r\nhad begun, it is stated that certain of the labourers preferred to live by\r\nbegging instead of by labour, and it is therefore forbidden to give alms\r\nto beggars. According to Knighton, the effect of the ordinance itself was\r\nto swell the ranks of the wandering poor; when some were arrested,\r\nimprisoned, or fined in terms of the commission to the sheriffs, others\r\nfled to the woods and wastes (_ad silvas et boscos_)[347]. These escapes\r\ncontinued for years after; the rolls of the Manor Court of Winslow have\r\nentries of many such cases long after the pestilence[348]. Many of these\r\nfugitive villeins formed the class of “wasters,” often referred to in the\r\n_Vision of Piers the Ploughman_: “waster would not work, but wander\r\nabout,” or he would work only in harvest, squander his earnings, and for\r\nthe rest of the year feel the pinch of hunger “until both his eyen\r\nwatered.” But it is clear that others went to distant manors, and settled\r\ndown again to steady employment, freed from their bonds as _nativi_; and\r\nit cannot be doubted that some went to the towns[349].\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the causes and circumstances of the labour difficulty\r\nafter the enormous thinning of the population, it may be well to recall\r\nthe composition of the village communities. In each manor the arable land\r\nwas in two portions--on the one hand the immense open fields (two or\r\nperhaps three) in which the villagers had each so many half-acre strips,\r\nand on the other hand the lord’s demesne, or home-farm. Part of the latter\r\nwould often be let to free tenants, or even to villeins, who would count\r\nfor the occasion as free tenants. For the cultivation of his demesne the\r\nlord was dependent on his tenants in villenage, who owed him, in form, so\r\nmany days’ work in the year, but in reality were often able to commute\r\ntheir personal services for a money payment and are said to have done so\r\nvery generally[350]. Thus the lord of the manor was no longer able to call\r\nupon his serfs to plough or to sow or to reap; he had to hire them for his\r\noccasions. The free tenants would also be dependent to some extent upon\r\nhired labour; and as some even of the villeins cultivated up to forty\r\nacres or more, in the open fields of the manor, these would also have to\r\nhire unless their families were old enough to help. All that labour for\r\nhire would naturally be supplied by the poorer villagers, the cottars and\r\nbordars, who would seldom cultivate more than a few half-acres, and in\r\nsome cases perhaps none[351]. The lower order of tenants in villenage\r\nformed accordingly the class of labourers; and it was their demands which\r\ngave occasion for the ordinances of 1350 and the statute of 1351. In each\r\nmanor the lord would have been affected more than all the rest by the\r\nscarcity of labour, in respect of the extensive demesne or home-farm\r\nmanaged by his bailiff. It is conjectured that he tried, in some cases, to\r\ngo back to his rights of customary service from his villeins, which had\r\ngradually become commutable for rents paid in money, and that the attempts\r\nto do so led to insubordination[352]. He had to pay wages, notwithstanding\r\nall his rights of lordship. The wages paid in the harvest of 1349 were,\r\nsays Rogers, those of panic. In the form of petition which brought the\r\nlabour-question before Parliament in February 1351, it is stated that the\r\nwages demanded were at double or treble the old rate; of the year\r\npreceding (1350) it is recorded that the wages paid to labourers for\r\ngathering the harvest on the manor of Ham, belonging to the lord Berkeley,\r\namounted to 1144 days’ work, on the old scale of commutation[353].\r\n\r\nThe labourers, although the lowest order on the manors, were accordingly\r\nmasters of the situation. Personal service to the lord, measurable merely\r\nby days, and having no reference to fluctuations in the rate of wages, had\r\nbecome obsolete; nor do the ordinance of 1350 and the statute of 1351 give\r\nany hint of trying to revive it. If the men refused to be hired at the old\r\nrate, they were to be arrested and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many things besides the statute, tending to keep\r\nthe majority of peasants on the manors where they had been born; so that\r\nthe formal abolition of villenage remained to be carried by rebellion in\r\n1381, while many traces of it in practice remained for long after. Those\r\nwho stayed on their old manors, or removed to another county or hundred to\r\nbecome tenants under new lords, were able to get permanently better wages;\r\nthe price of labour remained about forty per cent. higher than it had been\r\nbefore the mortality; so that the statute was on the whole ineffective.\r\nBut another large proportion of the labouring class appears to have been\r\ndriven to a wandering life. It is not easy to explain on economical\r\nprinciples why the class of “wasters,” of whom we hear so much, should\r\nhave been called into existence. Hands were scarce, and wages were high;\r\nthe conditions look on the surface to be entirely adverse to the creation\r\nof a class of sturdy beggars and idle tramps. But the economic conditions\r\nwere really complex; and when all has been said on the head of economics,\r\nthere will remain something to be explained on the side of ethics.\r\n\r\nNot only the labourers but also the employers of labour were cut off in\r\nthe mortality. A great part of the capital of the country passed suddenly\r\ninto new hands. Before the Parliament of 1351 legislated upon wages, it\r\nwas occupied with a number of technical difficulties about wills. Of the\r\nproving of wills and the granting of letters of administration on a great\r\nscale we have had an instance from an archdeaconry in Lancashire. In\r\nColchester, a town with some four hundred burgesses, one hundred and\r\neleven wills were proved[354]. In the Husting Court of London, three\r\nhundred and sixty wills were enrolled and proved from 13th January, 1349,\r\nto 13th January, 1350. An immense number of persons came into money who\r\ncould not all have had the inclination, even if they had the skill and\r\naptitude, for employing it as capital. If there were wasters among the\r\nlabourers, there were wasters also among the moneyed class. The mortality\r\nproduced, indeed, that demoralisation of the whole national life which has\r\nbeen usually observed to follow in the like circumstances. “Almost all\r\ngreat epochs of moral degradation are connected with great epidemics,”\r\nsays Niebuhr, generalizing the evidence which Thucydides gives specially\r\nfor the plague of Athens[355]. The fourteenth century was by no means a\r\nperiod of high morality before the Black Death; but it was undoubtedly\r\nworse after it. Langland’s poem of the vision of Piers the Ploughman is\r\none long diatribe against the vices of the age, and some of the worst of\r\nthem he expressly dates “sith the pestilence time.” It will be convenient\r\nto take these ethical illustrations, before we proceed with the effects of\r\nthe mortality upon material prosperity and population, and with the\r\ndomestication of plague on the soil.\r\n\r\nSo far from the labouring class being the chief sinners, it is in the\r\nhumbler ranks that the root of goodness remains. Langland’s hero, the\r\nPloughman, is obviously chosen to represent “that ingenuous simplicity\r\nand native candour and integrity,” which, as Burke says, “formerly\r\ncharacterized the English nation,” and, one may add, have been at all\r\ntimes its saving grace. It was in that class that the reforming movement,\r\nled by Wyclif twenty years after, had its strength. Lollardy and the\r\nPeasants’ Rebellion were closely allied. The grievance of the latter was\r\nthat the gulf between the gentleman and the workman had become wider than\r\nin nature it should be. An ultimate and very indirect effect of the great\r\nmortality was to strengthen the middle class by recruits from beneath; it\r\ncreated the circumstances which produced the English yeoman of the\r\nfifteenth century. But we are here engaged with the immediate effect; and\r\nthat was to broaden the contrast between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\nLuxury had already touched so high a point as to call for a statute\r\nagainst extravagant living, the curious sumptuary law of 1336 which\r\nprohibited many courses at table. Nothing could be more significant of its\r\nlater developments in London than the sarcastic description, which fills\r\nan unusual space in one of the chroniclers, of the fantastic excesses of\r\ndress and ornament among the male sex about the year 1362[356]. Some of\r\nthe names of the men’s ornaments occur also in Langland’s verses:\r\n\r\n  “Sir John and Sir Goffray hath a gerdel of silver,\r\n   A basellarde or a ballok-knyf with botones overgilt.”\r\n\r\nThese effeminate fashions actually led to a Statute of Dress in 1363, in\r\nwhich also the lower class are forbidden to ape their betters. It is\r\nperhaps to these hangers-on of wealth that Langland refers in his bitter\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    “Right so! ye rich, ye robeth that be rich | and helpeth them that\r\n    helpeth you, and giveth where no need is. | As who so filled a tun of\r\n    a fresh river | and went forth with that water to woke with Thames. |\r\n    Right so! ye rich, ye robe and feed | them that have as ye have, them\r\n    ye make at ease.”\r\n\r\nBut, as for the poor, Avarice considers them fair game:\r\n\r\n    “I have as moche pite of pore men as pedlere hath of cattes, | that\r\n    wolde kill them if he cacche hem myghte, for covetise of their\r\n    skynnes.”\r\n\r\nIn London the preaching clergy are accused of pandering to the avarice of\r\nthe rich:\r\n\r\n    “And were mercy in mean men no more than in rich | mendicants meatless\r\n    might go to bed. | God is much in the gorge of these great masters, |\r\n    but among mean men his mercy and his works. | Friars and faitours have\r\n    found such questions, | to plese with proud men sithen the pestilence\r\n    tyme, | and prechers at Saint Poules, for pure envye of clerkis, |\r\n    that folke is nought firmed in the feith ne fill of their goodes. |\r\n    ... Ne be plentyous to the pore as pure charitye wolde, | but in\r\n    gayness and in glotonye forglotten her goode hem selve, | and breken\r\n    noughte to the beggar as the Boke techeth.”\r\n\r\nThe friars had lost altogether the enthusiasm of their early days:\r\n\r\n    “And how that friars followed folk that was rich, | and folk that was\r\n    poor at little price they set; | and no corpse in their kirk-yard nor\r\n    in their kirk was buried, | but quick he bequeath them aughte or\r\n    should help quit their debts.”\r\n\r\nAs for the monks, the same might have been said of them before; but now\r\nmore land had been thrown into their possession by the mortality:\r\n\r\n  “Ac now is Religion a ryder, a rowmer bi streetes,\r\n   A leader of love-days, and a lond-buyer,\r\n   A pricker on a palfrey fro manere to manere,\r\n   An heap of houndes at his ers, as he a lord were.\r\n   And but if his knave kneel, that shall his cup bringe,\r\n   He lowreth on hym, and axeth hym who taught hym curtesye.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Langland’s poem, the country clergy left their livings and\r\ncame up to London:--\r\n\r\n    “Parsons and parish priests plained them to the bishop | that their\r\n    parishes were poor sith the pestilence time; | to have licence and\r\n    leave at London to dwell | and syngen there for simony, for silver is\r\n    sweet. | Bishops and bachelors, both masters and doctours, | that have\r\n    cures under Christ and crowning in token and sign, | that they should\r\n    shrive their parishours, preach and pray for them and the poor feed, |\r\n    live in London in Lent and  all”--\r\n\r\nsome of them serving the king in the offices of Exchequer and Chancery,\r\nand some acting as the stewards of lords.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubted that the business of the courts in London received a great\r\nimpetus after the mortality, as one can readily understand from the\r\nnumber of inheritances, successions, and feudal claims that had to be\r\nsettled. Several of the Inns of Chancery date from about that time.\r\nGascoigne, who was “cancellarius” at Oxford about 1430, and had access to\r\nthe rolls of former “cancellarii,” was struck by the increase of legists\r\nafter the commotion of 1349: “Before the great pestilence there were few\r\ndisputes among the people, and few pleas; and, accordingly, there were few\r\nlegists in the realm of England, and few legists in Oxford, at a time when\r\nthere were thirty thousand scholars in Oxford, as I have seen in the\r\nrolls,” etc.[357]\r\n\r\nThe country clergy, such of them as remained in their cures were a\r\nnotoriously illiterate class; according to Knighton, they could read the\r\nLatin services without understanding what they read. Langland makes a\r\nparson confess his poor qualifications to be the spiritual guide of his\r\nflock; on the other hand he was not without skill in the sports of the\r\nfield: “But I can fynde in a felde or in a furlonge an hare.” At one of\r\nthe manor courts in Wiltshire in 1361, a gang of the district clergy were\r\nconvicted of night poaching[358].\r\n\r\nSuch being the state of matters among the upper and middle classes, it is\r\nnot surprising to find a lax morality among the lower orders. The\r\nploughman is as severe a satirist of his own class as he is of the rich.\r\nIn London we have a picture of the interior of a tavern crowded with\r\nloafers of all sorts “early in the morning.” In the country also the\r\ncontrast is drawn between the industrious and the idle class:\r\n\r\n    “And whoso helpeth me to erie [plough] or sowen here ere I wende |\r\n    shall have leve, bi oure Lorde to lese here in harvest, | and make him\r\n    merry there-mydde, maugre whoso begruccheth it: | save Jakke the\r\n    jogeloure and Jonet of the stewes, | and Danget the dys-playere, and\r\n    Denot the bawd, | and Frere the faytoure and folk of his order, | and\r\n    Robyn the rybaudoure for his rusty wordes.”\r\n\r\nTo live out of wedlock was nothing unusual:\r\n\r\n    “Many of you ne wedde nought the wimmen that ye with delen, | but as\r\n    wilde bestis with wehe worthen up and worchen, | and bryngeth forth\r\n    barnes that bastardes men calleth.”\r\n\r\nIll-assorted marriages also appear to have been common:\r\n\r\n    “It is an oncomely couple, bi Cryst, as me-thinketh, | to gyven a\r\n    yonge wenche to an olde feble, | or wedden any widwe for welth of hir\r\n    goodis, | that never shall bairne bere but if it be in armes. | Many a\r\n    paire sithen the pestilence have plight hem togiders: | the fruit that\r\n    thei brynge forth aren foule wordes: | in jalousye joyeles and\r\n    jangling in bedde | have thei no children but cheste and choppyng hem\r\n    betweene.”\r\n\r\nChapmen did not chastise their children. Old traditions of weather-lore,\r\nand of reckoning the yield of harvest, were forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to the uniformly bad picture of the times given by Langland,\r\nwe may turn to the gay and good-humoured scenes of the ‘Canterbury Tales.’\r\nBut Chaucer was emphatically the poet of the cultured class, and it is\r\nproper to his muse to keep within the limits of a well-bred cynicism.\r\nAgain, Langland’s strictures on the avarice and other vices of the rich\r\nmay seem to be a mere echo of a very old cry, which finds equally strong\r\nexpression in Roger of Wendover, about the year 1235, and in Robert of\r\nBrunne’s ‘Handlyng Synne’ in the year 1303. But the Vision of the\r\nPloughman is too consistent, and too concrete, to be considered as a mere\r\nhomily on the wickedness of the times, such as might have been written of\r\nalmost any age or of any country in which the Seven Mortal Sins were still\r\ncalled by their plain names. The words “sithen the pestilence” recur so\r\noften, that this contemporary author must be held as sharing the belief\r\nthat the Black Death made a marked difference to the morals of the nation\r\nthroughout all classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore lasting effects on Farming, Industries, and Population.\r\n\r\nTurning from things moral to things material, we shall find that the Great\r\nMortality left its mark on the cultivated area of the country, on rents of\r\nland, on the kind of tenure and the system of farming, on industry, trade\r\nand municipal government, on the population, and, on what chiefly\r\nconcerns us, the subsequent health of the country.\r\n\r\nCorn-growing would appear to have met with at least a temporary check.\r\nThree water-mills near Shrewsbury fell in annual value by one half, owing\r\nto the scarcity of corn to grind[359]. Richmond, one of the chief\r\ncorn-markets in Yorkshire, is said, on rather uncertain evidence, to have\r\nbeen permanently reduced for the same reason; besides losing an enormous\r\nnumber by the plague itself (vaguely stated at 2000), the town lost its\r\ncorn-trade through the land around falling out of cultivation, so that\r\nsome of the burgesses, being unable to pay rent, had to wander abroad as\r\nmendicants[360].\r\n\r\nThe general statements of Knighton, Le Baker and others for England (not\r\nto mention numerous rhetorical passages of foreign writers), to the effect\r\nthat whole villages were left desolate, are borne out by the petitions\r\nrecurring in the Rolls of Parliament for many years after. There are also\r\nsome references to the continuing desolateness of particular places, which\r\nare probably fair samples of a larger number.\r\n\r\nThus a rich clergyman in Hertfordshire had given, just before the Black\r\nDeath, all his lands and tenements in Braghinge, Herts, to the prior and\r\nconvent of Anglesey, Cambridgeshire, in consideration that they should\r\nfind at their proper expense a chantry of two priests for ever in the\r\nchurch of Anglesey, to say masses for the souls of the benefactor and his\r\nfamily. But on the 10th of May, 1351, he remitted the charge and support\r\nof one of the two said priests, on the ground that, “on account of the\r\nvast mortality, lands lie uncultivated in many and innumerable places, not\r\na few tenements daily and suddenly decay and are pulled down, rents and\r\nservices cannot be levied, but a much smaller profit is obliged to be\r\ntaken than usual[361].” An instance of a long-abiding effect is that of\r\nthe manor of Hockham belonging to the earl of Arundel, which was not\r\ntenanted for thirty years[362].\r\n\r\nThe history of rents is peculiar. The immediate effect, as we learn from\r\nKnighton, as well as from the rolls of particular manor courts, was a\r\nremission of them by the lords, lest their tenants in villenage should\r\nquit the lands. There was, indeed, a competition among landlords for\r\ntenants to occupy their manors, so that the cultivators could make their\r\nown terms. Of that we have had an instance from the manor of Ensham,\r\nbelonging to Christ Church, Oxford[363]. But, after a few years, rents\r\nappear to have come back to near their old level. The following figures\r\nhave been compiled from the Tower records of assizes made for the purpose\r\nof taxation[364]:\r\n\r\n  1268    9_d._\r\n  1348-9  --\r\n  1417    6_d._\r\n  1446    8_d._\r\n  1271   12_d._\r\n  1359    9¼_d._\r\n  1422    4_d._\r\n  1336   11½_d._\r\n  1368   10½_d._\r\n  1429    4_d._\r\n  1338   11½_d._\r\n  1381    9¾_d._\r\n  1432    6_d._\r\n\r\nThe great fall, it will be seen, was in the next century.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking effect upon agriculture of the upheaval produced\r\nby the great mortality was, as Thorold Rogers has shown, in changing the\r\nsystem of farming and in creating the type of the English yeoman. The\r\nsystem of farming the lord’s demesne or home-farm by a bailiff, never very\r\nprofitable, became, says that historian, quite unproductive, owing\r\nespecially to the permanent rise in wages. The small men who took the\r\nlord’s land to farm--they had been doing so to some extent\r\nbefore[365]--had not sufficient of their own for stock and seed; but they\r\ngot advances from the lord, which were repaid in due course. It was a kind\r\nof _métairie_ farming. It prevailed for about fifty years, by which time\r\nthe ordinary system of farming on lease was becoming general. Finally, and\r\nespecially in the Civil Wars of the fifteenth century, much of the land\r\nwhich had belonged in fee to the feudal lords, passed away by purchase to\r\nthe tenant farmers[366]. Thus arose the famous breed of English\r\nyeomen--the “good yeomen whose limbs were made in England.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mortality upon trade and industry was, momentarily, to\r\nparalyse them. Of the great wool-trade, Rogers, the historian of English\r\nprices, says: “Nothing, I think, in the whole history of these prices is\r\nmore significant of the terror and prostration induced by the plague than\r\nthe sudden fall in the price of wool at this time. It is a long time\r\nbefore a recovery takes place[367].” But from 1364 to 1380, the price of\r\nwool was uniformly above the average; and, if there be any accuracy in\r\nAvesbury’s figures already given for the years following 1355, the export\r\nof bales of wool to the Continent (100,000 sacks in a year, he says, each\r\nsack being a bale of the present colonial size, or weighing about three\r\nhundredweights) meant a very considerable amount of labour, tonnage and\r\nexchange. Among other articles of export, we hear specially of iron, in a\r\npetition to Parliament of 28 Ed. III. (1354); the price of iron had risen\r\nto four times what it was before the plague, and it was desired to stop\r\nthe export of it and to fix the price[368].\r\n\r\nThe effect of the mortality upon the industries of the country was shown\r\nmost in Norwich. That city was the centre of the Flemish cloth-weaving,\r\nwhich had been flourishing in Norfolk for some twenty years, under the\r\ndirect encouragement of Edward III., and of a protective statute against\r\nforeign-made cloth. Before the pestilence, Norwich was the second city in\r\nthe kingdom. In the king’s warrant for men-at-arms, which was indeed\r\nissued in 1350, but may be taken as drawn up on the old lines and\r\nirrespective of the pestilence, the quota of Norwich is rated at 60,\r\nLondon’s being 100, Bristol’s and Lynn’s 20 each, that of Coventry,\r\nGloucester, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Winchester, Sarum, Oxford, Canterbury\r\nand Bury St Edmund’s 10 each, and of other towns from 8 to 1 each, York\r\nnot being mentioned. But in the Subsidy Roll of 1377, which shows how many\r\npersons, above the age of fourteen, paid the poll-tax of a groat in each\r\ncounty and in each principal town, Norwich comes sixth in the list instead\r\nof second, being far surpassed in numbers by York and Bristol, and\r\nsurpassed considerably by Coventry and Plymouth. So far from being in a\r\nproportion to London of 60 to 100, it is now in a proportion of 3952 to\r\n23,314, its whole population, as estimated, being 7410 against 44,770 in\r\nthe capital which at one time it bade fair to rival. It had lost heavily\r\nin the Black Death, and so had the populous district around it, where the\r\nFlemish industries and trade were planted in numerous villages. By 1368,\r\nten of the sixty very small parishes of Norwich had disappeared, and\r\nfourteen more disappeared by degrees, the ruins of twenty of them being\r\nstill visible[369].\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the significance of these figures and facts for the\r\nsecond city of the kingdom. At least one generation passed before Norwich\r\nrecovered something of its old prosperity. In the fifteenth century it was\r\nstill the chief seat of the woollen manufactures; the county of Norfolk\r\nkept its old pre-eminence, although rival centres of industry had grown\r\nup. There were, however, causes at work which at length reduced the\r\ncapital of East Anglia to a comparatively poor state. One of the\r\nintermediate glimpses that we get of it--they are not many, even in\r\nBlomefield’s history--is the statute of 1455, to put down the enormous\r\nnumber of “pettifogging attorneys” in the city and county[370]. Its real\r\ndecline was in the early Tudor reigns. When Henry VII. visited Norwich in\r\n1497, the mayor in presenting the Queen’s usual gold cup with a hundred\r\npieces in it, took occasion to tell the monarch “howbeit that they are\r\nmore poor, and not of such wealth as they have been afore these\r\ndays[371].” When the town suffered much from fires about the year 1505,\r\nthe city of London raised large sums in aid of its rebuilding. To the same\r\nperiod belongs a municipal order that no one should dig holes in the\r\nmarket-place to get sand, without the mayor’s licence. In 1525, there was\r\na general decay of work, the clothiers and farmers being unable to employ\r\nthe artisans and labourers, who began to rise in revolt against the heavy\r\ntaxes. An Act of 33 Hen. VIII. recites that the making and weaving of\r\nworsteds is wholly decayed and taken away from the city of Norwich and\r\ncounty of Norfolk--by the deceit and crafty practices of the great\r\nmultitude of regrators and buyers of the said yarn. These evidences of\r\ndecline in prosperity are in part long after the Black Death; but they\r\nseem to have been continuous from that event.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the other large towns of England, they did not all fare\r\nalike. The capital was more luxurious, and probably not less populous,\r\nafter the mortality than before it. The chancery and exchequer business\r\nalone would have served to draw numbers to it; and we may be sure, from\r\nall subsequent experience, that the gaps left by the plague were filled up\r\nby influx from the provinces and from abroad in the course of two or three\r\nyears. Nor does it appear from the poll-tax that York had suffered to\r\nanything like the same extent as Norwich; while Bristol and Coventry\r\nbecame towns of much greater consequence than before the plague. On the\r\nother hand, Lincoln is described, in a petition for relief in 1399 (1 Hen.\r\nIV.) as being “in the greater part empty and uninhabited.” In the same\r\nyear, Yarmouth has its houses “vacant and void,” although, in 1369, it is\r\nsaid to have “gained so much upon Norwich” that it was made a seat of the\r\nwool-staple. Other towns which figure in petitions to Parliament as\r\n“impoverished and desolate of people,” are Ilchester (1407) and Truro\r\n(1410). Camden instances the ancient borough of Wallingford, on the\r\nThames, as having been permanently reduced by the Black Death, although\r\nthe inhabitants, he says, traced the decay of the town to the diversion of\r\ntraffic over the new bridges at Abingdon and Dorchester[372]. Some parts\r\nof Cambridge would appear to have borne the traces of the pestilence for a\r\nnumber of years after. A charter of the bishop of Ely, dated 12 September,\r\n1365, mentions that the parishioners of All Saints (on the north-east\r\nside) are for the most part dead by pestilence, and those that are alive\r\nare gone to the parishes of other churches; that the parishioners of St\r\nGiles’s (the adjoining parish, near the Castle) have died; and that the\r\nnave of All Saints is ruinous and the bones of dead bodies are exposed to\r\nbeasts; therefore the bishop unites All Saints and St Giles’s[373]. At\r\nthat time the churches of those parishes would have been small, perhaps\r\nnot much larger than the little church of St Peter still standing on the\r\nhigh ground opposite to the great modern church of St Giles.\r\n\r\nThese instances of the chequered history of English towns subsequent to\r\nthe great mortality are not altogether favourable to the generality which\r\nhas been put forward by an able historian[374], that the great social\r\nrevolution produced by that event was to detach the people from the soil,\r\nto drive them into the towns, to increase the urban population\r\ndisproportionately to the rural, to plant the germs of commerce and\r\nindustry, and to determine that expansion of England which became manifest\r\nin the end of the Elizabethan period and under the Stuarts, the British\r\nnation being “doomed by its economic conditions to take the course which\r\nit has taken.” Many things happened between the Black Death and the\r\nexpansion of England. The fifteenth century intervened, which was in its\r\nmiddle period, at least, distinguished as much by the rise of the yeoman\r\nclass as by the growth of trade guilds in the town. But that which mars\r\nthe generality most of all was the decline of industries and the decay of\r\ntowns (London and Bristol always excepted) in the reigns of Henry VII. and\r\nHenry VIII.; the country had to recover from that before the Elizabethan\r\nexpansion,--before the nation began “to increase rapidly in population\r\nuntil at length it should overflow the limits of its island home.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, one effect of the great mortality was to mobilise the\r\nclass of agricultural labourers, and to drive a certain number of them\r\ninto the towns. Proof of that migration comes from the statutes and the\r\nRolls of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    An Act of 34 Edward III. (1360) imposes a fine of ten pounds to the\r\n    king on the mayor and bailiffs of any town refusing “to deliver up a\r\n    labourer, servant, or artificer” who had absented himself from his\r\n    master’s service, with a farther fine of five pounds to the lord. In\r\n    1376 the “Good Parliament” makes complaint that servants and labourers\r\n    quitted service on the slightest cause, and then led an idle life in\r\n    towns, or wandered in parties about the country, “many becoming\r\n    beggars, others staff-strikers, but the greater number taking to\r\n    robbing.” More direct evidence of industries diverting hands from farm\r\n    labour is found in the various statutes about apprentices. In the Act\r\n    of 12 Ric. II. (1388) it is provided that “he or she which use to\r\n    labour at the plough and cart or other labour or service of husbandry\r\n    till they be of the age of twelve years, shall abide at that labour\r\n    without being put to any mystery or handicraft; and if any covenant or\r\n    bond of apprentice be from henceforth made to the contrary, the same\r\n    shall be holden for none.” A more definite provision of the same kind\r\n    was made in 7 Hen. IV. (1405-6): “Notwithstanding the good statutes\r\n    aforemade, infants whose fathers and mothers have no land, nor rent,\r\n    nor other living, but only their service or mystery, be put to serve\r\n    and bound apprentices to divers crafts within cities and boroughs,\r\n    sometimes at the age of twelve years, sometimes within the said age,\r\n    and that for the pride of clothing and other evil customs which\r\n    servants do use in the same” etc.--the result being that farm\r\n    labourers were scarce; therefore no one, not having land or rent of\r\n    twenty-shillings a year, to bind his son or daughter of whatsoever age\r\n    to serve as apprentice within any city or borough. In the 8th of Henry\r\n    VI. (1429) this statute was repealed so far as respected London, on\r\n    account of the hindrance which the said statute might occasion to the\r\n    inhabitants of that city[375].\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted if, after the Black Death, the towns underwent any\r\nmarked industrial development, except in such cases as Coventry and\r\nBristol. On the other hand, the cloth-weaving of East Anglia was dispersed\r\nover the country, more particularly to the western and south-western\r\ncounties, so that the west of England gained an industrial character which\r\nit retained until the comparatively modern rise of the cloth-industries of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire. But it was in great part a development of\r\nvillage industries upon the old manorial basis, as well as a migration of\r\nlabour to the towns.\r\n\r\nWe have an authentic instance, and probably a typical instance, in the\r\nmanor and barony of Castle Combe, of which the social history has been\r\npieced together from the rolls of its manor court by one of the earliest\r\nstudents of that class of documents. Before the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury this village situated among the Wiltshire hills, difficult of\r\naccess and almost secluded from the highways, had grown into a thriving\r\ncommunity of weavers, fullers, dyers, glovers, and the like, with their\r\nattendant tradings and marketings, all upon its old manorial basis, and\r\nwith its old agriculture going hand in hand with its new industries. There\r\nwere free or copyhold tenants occupying their farms, while several\r\nclothiers and occupiers of fulling-mills held farms also, “driving a\r\ndouble and evidently a very thriving trade, accumulating considerable\r\nwealth and giving employment to a large number of artizans who had been\r\nattracted to the place for this purpose. Yet, strange to say, some of the\r\nwealthiest and most prosperous of these tradesmen were still subject to\r\nthe odious bonds of serfship, adscript the soil[376].” It is clear,\r\nhowever, that the jury of the manor court took care that the lord should\r\nnot have the best of it. The morals of this industrial village were, as\r\nmight have been expected, somewhat lax[377]. At the same time the removal\r\nof nuisances was insisted upon by this self-governing community as\r\neffectively, perhaps, as if it had been under the Local Government\r\nActs[378].\r\n\r\nAnother kind of effect than the industrial, upon the state of the towns,\r\nis exemplified in the case of Shrewsbury. The dislocation of the old\r\nsocial order had somehow touched the privileges and monopolies of\r\nmunicipal corporations and guilds, and given power to a hitherto\r\nunenfranchised class. The general question, besides being a somewhat new\r\none, is foreign to this subject; but the reference to Shrewsbury is given,\r\nas the “late pestilence” is expressly connected with the municipal\r\nchanges. A patent of the 35th of Edward III. (1361), relating to the town\r\nof Shrewsbury, recites the grievous debates and dissensions which had\r\narisen therein, “through the strangers who had newly come to reside in the\r\nsaid town after the late pestilence, and were plotting to draw to\r\nthemselves the government of the said town[379].”\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that population in the country at large speedily\r\nrighted itself, according to the principle that population always tends to\r\ncome close to the limit of subsistence. But there is reason to think that\r\nthe means of subsistence were themselves reduced. We read of corn-land\r\nrunning to waste, although most of the references to desolation are\r\nperhaps to be taken as true for only one or two harvests following the\r\nplague. Again, it is undoubted that sheep-farming and the pasturing of\r\ncattle at length took the place of much of the old agriculture. It is not\r\neasy to make out when the change begins; but there are instances of rural\r\ndepopulation as early as 1414[380], and the same had become a burning\r\ngrievance in the time of cardinal Morton and the early years of sir Thomas\r\nMore. It has been assumed, also, that the “positive checks” to population\r\nhad been taken off, when they ought in theory so to have been: that is to\r\nsay, after the inhabitants had been enormously thinned. The statement of\r\nHecker, that there was increased fecundity after the pestilence, appears\r\nto be an instance of that author’s _a priori_ habit of mind[381]. What we\r\nread in an English chronicle of the time is just the opposite, namely,\r\nthat “the women who survived remained for the most part barren during\r\nseveral years[382].” The authority is not conclusive, but the statement is\r\nin keeping with what we may gather from Langland’s poem as to ill-assorted\r\nand sterile marriages, and as to illicit unions, which, as Malthus\r\nteaches, are comparatively unfruitful. The alleged sterility is also in\r\nkeeping with, although not strictly parallel to, the experience of crowded\r\nIndian provinces, such as Orissa, where a thinning of the population by\r\nfamine and disease has been statistically proved to be followed by a\r\nmarked decrease of fecundity. More direct evidence of a permanent loss of\r\npeople occurs a generation after the Black Death, at a time when the\r\ncircumstances of health were such as would explain it.\r\n\r\nThe poll-tax of 1377 was a means of estimating the population. The tax was\r\nlevied on every person, male or female, above the age of fourteen. In\r\nestimating the population from the poll-tax returns, it is usual to add\r\none-fifth for taxable subjects who had evaded it, and to reckon the\r\ntaxable subjects above fourteen years as two-thirds of the whole\r\npopulation. On that basis of reckoning, the population of the whole of\r\nEngland, except Cheshire and Durham, in the year 1377 would have been\r\n2,580,828 (or 1,376,442 who actually paid their groat each). The\r\npopulation of the principal towns is calculated, in the second column of\r\nthe Table, from the numbers in the first column who actually paid the\r\npoll-tax, according to the Subsidy Roll of 51 Edward III.\r\n\r\n  Laity assessed for the Poll-tax of 1377 in each of the following Towns,\r\n  being persons of either sex above the age of fourteen years.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------\r\n                    |  Taxed |Estimated\r\n                    |        |Population\r\n  ------------------|--------|----------\r\n  London            | 23,314 | 44,770\r\n  York              |   7248 | 13,590\r\n  Bristol           |   6345 | 11,904\r\n  Plymouth          |   4837 |   9069\r\n  Coventry          |   4817 |   9032\r\n  Norwich           |   3952 |   7410\r\n  Lincoln           |   3412 |   6399\r\n  Sarum             |   3226 |   6048\r\n  Lynn              |   3127 |   5863\r\n  Colchester        |   2955 |   5540\r\n  Beverley          |   2663 |   4993\r\n  Newcastle-on-Tyne |   2647 |   4963\r\n  Canterbury        |   2574 |   4826\r\n  Bury St Edmunds   |   2442 |   4580\r\n  Oxford            |   2357 |   4420\r\n  Gloucester        |   2239 |   4198\r\n  Leicester         |   2101 |   3939\r\n  Shrewsbury        |   2082 |   3904\r\n  Yarmouth          |   1941 |   3640\r\n  Hereford          |   1903 |   3568\r\n  Cambridge         |   1722 |   3230\r\n  Ely               |   1722 |   3230\r\n  Exeter            |   1560 |   2925\r\n  Hull              |   1557 |   2920\r\n  Worcester         |   1557 |   2920\r\n  Ipswich           |   1507 |   2825\r\n  Nottingham        |   1447 |   2713\r\n  Northampton       |   1447 |   2713\r\n  Winchester        |   1440 |   2700\r\n  Stamford          |   1218 |   2284\r\n  Newark            |   1178 |   2209\r\n  Wells             |   1172 |   2198\r\n  Ludlow            |   1172 |   2198\r\n  Southampton       |   1152 |   2160\r\n  Derby             |   1046 |   1961\r\n  Lichfield         |   1024 |   1920\r\n  Chichester        |    869 |   1630\r\n  Boston            |    814 |   1526\r\n  Carlisle          |    678 |   1271\r\n  Bath              |    570 |   1070\r\n  Rochester         |    570 |   1070\r\n  Dartmouth         |     506|    949\r\n  --------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat this indirect census was taken on a declining population may be\r\ninferred from the language of contemporaries. In the year of the poll-tax\r\n(1377), Richard II. addressed certain questions to Wyclif concerning the\r\npapal exactions of tribute; the reformer’s reply gives as the second\r\nobjection to the tribute “that the people decreases by reason of\r\n(_praetextu_) the withdrawal of this treasure, which should be spent in\r\nEngland[383].”\r\n\r\nIn the political poems of the time there are numerous references to the\r\npestilences and famines. One of these doggerel productions, “On the\r\nCouncil of London,” 1382, contains a clear reference to a decrease of the\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n  “In nos pestilentia saeva jam crescit,\r\n   Quod virorum fortium jam populus decrescit[384].”\r\n\r\nThese general expressions in writings of the time will appear the more\r\ncredible after we have carried the history of plague and other forms of\r\nepidemic sickness down through a whole generation from 1349.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemics following the Black Death.\r\n\r\nNot the least of the effects of the Black Death upon England was the\r\ndomestication of the foreign pestilence on the soil. For more than three\r\ncenturies bubo-plague was never long absent from one part of Britain or\r\nanother. The whole country was never again swamped by a vast wave of\r\nplague as in the fourteen months of 1348-49. Nor does it appear that the\r\nsucceeding plagues of the fourteenth century, the _pestis secunda_,\r\n_tertia_, _quarta_ and _quinta_ were all of the same type as the first, or\r\notherwise comparable to it. Disastrous as many subsequent English\r\nepidemics of bubo-plague were, they appear to have been localised in the\r\nNorth, perhaps, or in Norfolk, or confined to the young; and, above all,\r\nthe bubo-plague became, in its later period, peculiarly a disease of the\r\npoor in the towns, although it did not cease altogether in the villages\r\nand country houses until it ceased absolutely in 1666. For three hundred\r\nyears plague was the grand “zymotic” disease of England--the same type of\r\nplague that came from the East in 1347-49, continuously reproduced in a\r\nsuccession of epidemics at one place or another, which, by diligent\r\nsearch, can be made to fill the annals with few gaps, and, if the records\r\nwere better, could probably be made to fill most years. Britain was not\r\npeculiar among the countries of Europe in that respect, although the\r\nchronology of plagues abroad has not been worked out minutely, except for\r\nan occasional province in which some zealous archaeologist had happened to\r\ntake up the subject[385].\r\n\r\nFrom 1349 to 1361 there is no record of pestilence in England. There was\r\nscarcity or famine in 1353, owing to an unfavourable harvest, but nothing\r\nis said of an unusual amount of sickness. In 1361 came the _pestis\r\nsecunda_, which would hardly have been so called had it not presented the\r\nsame type as the great bubo-plague. There is little said of it in the\r\nchroniclers; but two of them mention that it was called the _pestis\r\npuerorum_, or plague of the juveniles; and a third gives the names of\r\nseveral great personages who died of it, including three bishops and\r\nHenry, duke of Lancaster, at his castle of Leicester, in Lent, 1362. This\r\nrecrudescence, then, of the seeds of plague in English soil, may be taken\r\nas having cut off the nobles and the young: that is to say, the members of\r\na class who had, by all accounts, escaped the first plague, and the rising\r\ngeneration who had either escaped the first plague as infants or had been\r\nborn subsequent to it. The same selection of victims was observed,\r\naccording to Guy de Chauliac, in the very same year at Avignon; in\r\ncontrast to the Black Death, the second plague there cut off the upper and\r\nwell-to-do classes, and an innumerable number of children[386]; among the\r\nformer, it is said, were five cardinals and a hundred bishops. From\r\nPoland, also, it is reported that the return of the plague, which happened\r\nin 1360, affected mostly, although not exclusively, the upper classes and\r\nchildren. It is clear from the Continental evidence that the second\r\npestilence was marked by the same buboes, carbuncles, and other signs as\r\nthe first. In some places, at least, it must have been as destructive as\r\nthe Black Death itself; thus, in Florence, says Petrarch (with obvious\r\nexaggeration) hardly ten in the thousand remained alive in the city after\r\nthe epidemic of 1359, while Boccaccio estimates the mortality of the year\r\nat the equally incredible figure of a hundred thousand. In London many\r\nmore wills than usual were enrolled in 1361, but not more than a third of\r\nthe number enrolled in 1349: viz. 4 in February, 2 in March, 8 in April, 8\r\nin May, 12 in June, 39 in July, 28 in October, 15 in November, 11 in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe _pestis secunda_ is only one of a series of pestilences in the reigns\r\nof Edward III. and Richard II., which the chroniclers number in succession\r\nto the _pestis quinta_ in 1391. The entries in the annals are for the most\r\npart so meagre and colourless that they give us no help in realizing the\r\nshare that a continuous infection in the soil, from the Black Death\r\nonwards, may have had in bringing about the disastrous state of the\r\ncountry in the latter half of the fourteenth century. Edward III. was\r\nruined in reputation by his French wars, and ended his long reign in\r\ndishonour. His grandson Richard II. found the task of government too much\r\nfor him, and was deposed. The history of this period is not complete\r\nwithout some account of the health of the country; a single line or\r\nsentence in a chronicle, to mark the date of a _pestis tertia_ or _quarta_\r\nor _quinta_, hardly does justice to the place of national sickness among\r\nthe events with which historians fill their pages. The graphic picture of\r\nthe times is ‘The Vision of Piers the Ploughman,’ some passages of which\r\nmay help us to realize what the bare enumeration of second, third, fourth\r\nand fifth pestilences meant. Some Latin poems of the time may be cited in\r\nsupport; and for more particular evidence of the type of pestilence which\r\nremained in England after the Black Death, we shall have to refer to\r\ncertain extant manuscript treatises, from the latter part of the\r\nfourteenth century, which had been written in English to meet the wants of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe Latin poems of the time of Edward III. and Richard II. need only be\r\nreferred to so as to bring out by contrast the immense superiority of the\r\n‘Vision of Piers the Ploughman.’ The poems of John of Bridlington, which\r\nare the most considerable of the Latin series of verses, contain numerous\r\nreferences to the epidemics of the time, both at home and abroad.\r\nCuriously, he dwells more upon the effects of famine--flux and fever--than\r\nupon the plague proper, which he nowhere distinguishes. Thus, of France\r\nabout the time of the Black Death:\r\n\r\n  “Destructis granis, deerit mox copia panis;\r\n   Poena fames panis, venter fluxu fit inanis.”\r\n\r\nOr again, with specific reference to the _pestis secunda_ of 1361, which\r\nwe know to have been bubo-plague:\r\n\r\n        “... fluxus nocet, undique febris\r\n  Extirpat fluxus pollutos crimine luxus.”\r\n\r\nAnother reference, in the form of a prophecy, which from the context is\r\nclearly to the pestilence of 1368-69, again dwells exclusively upon\r\nfamine:\r\n\r\n  “In mensis justi pandetur copia crusti:\r\n   Fundis falsorum premet arcta fames famulorum.”\r\n\r\nfollowed by a note in Latin: “from which it appears that the poor in those\r\ndays were ill off for want of food[387].” One Latin poem of the end of the\r\nfourteenth century is expressly “On the Pestilence,” in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n  “Ecce dolet Anglia luctibus imbuta,\r\n   Gens tremit tristitia sordibus polluta,\r\n   Necat pestilentia viros atque bruta.\r\n   Cur? Quia flagitia regnant resoluta[388].”\r\n\r\nTurning to the far more real or observant work of the same date by\r\nLangland, we find among his general references to sickness a most\r\nsignificant one in which he compares it to the continual dropping of rain\r\nthrough a leaky roof: “The rain that raineth where we rest should, be\r\nsicknesses and sorrows that we suffer oft.” Again, in the allegory of\r\nConscience and Nature, the former makes appeal to Nature to come forth as\r\nthe scourge of evil-living:\r\n\r\n    “Nature Conscience heard, and came out of the planets, and sent forth\r\n    his fore-goers, fevers and fluxes, coughs and cardiacles, cramps and\r\n    toothaches, rheums and radegoundes and roynous scalls, boils and\r\n    botches and burning agues, frenzies and foul evils--foragers of Nature\r\n    had ypricked and preyed polls of people that largely a legion lose\r\n    their life soon. Eld the hoary, he was in the vanguard, and bare the\r\n    banner before Death, by right he it claimed. Nature came after, with\r\n    many keen sores, as pokkes and pestilences, and much people shent. So\r\n    Nature through corruptions killed many. Death came driving after, and\r\n    all to dust dashed kings and knights, kaisers and popes, learned and\r\n    lewd, he let no man stand that he hit even, that ever stirred after.\r\n    Many a lovely lady, and lemans of knights, swooned and swelted for\r\n    sorrow of Death’s dints.”\r\n\r\n    But “Conscience of his courtesy to Nature he besought, to cease and\r\n    suffer and see whether they would leave pride privily and be perfect\r\n    Christens. And Nature ceased then, to see the people amend. Fortune\r\n    gan flatter those few that were alive, and promised them long life;\r\n    and Lechery he sent among all manner men, wedded and unwedded, and\r\n    gathered a great host all against Conscience[389].”\r\n\r\nNext came Avarice, Envy and other of the deadly sins, so that the respite\r\nwhich Nature had given was of no real avail.\r\n\r\nA clear reference to pestilence continuing in the country comes in where\r\nthe pope’s exactions are mentioned. The pope did nothing in return for his\r\nEnglish tribute:\r\n\r\n  “Had I a clerk that could write, I would cast him a bill\r\n   That he send me under his seal a salve for the pestilence,\r\n   And that his blessing and his bulls botches might destroy.\r\n   For, sith he hath the power that Peter himself had,\r\n   He hath the pot with the salve, soothly as me thinketh.”\r\n\r\nAmong the other consequences “sithen the pestilence,” was this: “So is\r\npride waxen, in religion and in all the realm among rich and poor, that\r\nprayers have no power the pestilence to let; ... ne for dread of the death\r\nwithdraw not their pride.”\r\n\r\nThe _pestis secunda_ of 1361, or _pestis puerorum_, may perhaps be pointed\r\nto in the passage where chapmen are blamed for indulging their children,\r\n“ne for no pouste of pestilence correct them overmuch.” The ill-assorted\r\nmarriages had doubtless followed the great mortality itself; but the\r\nsecond pestilence, of 1361, which affected the upper classes especially,\r\nand is said by one chronicler to have cut off more men than women[390],\r\nmay have been more specially pointed to in Langland’s reference. Of that\r\npestilence a chronicle of the next century has preserved a curious\r\nreminiscence: among its victims were men, doubtless of the upper class,\r\n“whose wives, as women out of gouvernance, took as well strangers to their\r\nhusbands and other lewd and simple people, the which, forgetting their\r\nawe, worship and birth, coupled and married them with them that were of\r\nlow degree and low reputation[391].”\r\n\r\nAlthough Langland, when he speaks of changes “sith the pestilence time,”\r\nmeans the great mortality of 1349, he means in other places, the second,\r\nthird, and perhaps also fourth pestilences[392]. The years of the\r\npestilences down to the fifth are not the same in all the chronicles;\r\nthere are indeed some nine outbreaks that might have been enumerated after\r\nthe Black Death to the end of the century. Some of these are clearly\r\nassociated with scarcity, and may have been of the old type of\r\nfamine-sickness; dysentery is, indeed, mentioned in connexion with the\r\nsickness of 1391[393]. Again, an epidemic in London in 1382 is said by a\r\nchronicler to have affected children (boys and girls), while the same\r\nchronicler is explicit that the sickness in Norfolk the year after was\r\nconfined to the young of both sexes under a certain age. Lastly, the\r\nepidemic of 1391 was so severe in the North as to recall the great\r\nmortality itself; but under the same year is the reference to sickness of\r\nthe type of dysentery due to rotten fruit; and under the year before,\r\n1390, two chroniclers agree that the epidemic was “mostly among children,”\r\nor that it cut off “more young than old.” It would be unsafe, therefore,\r\nto conclude that all the outbreaks of _pestis_ in England subsequent to\r\nthe Black Death, were of bubo-plague itself. The list of sicknesses in\r\nLangland’s poem gives, indeed, as much space to fevers and fluxes, burning\r\nagues and frenzies, as to boils and botches, foul evils, pokkes and\r\npestilences--by which latter group of synonyms the bubo-plague is meant.\r\n_Pestis_, it is well known, was a generic name in the medieval period,\r\njust as pest and pestilence are generic now. So generic was it that some\r\nmay doubt whether bubo-plague, of the type of 1349, was included at all\r\namong the _pestes_ of the generations following. Positive evidence of the\r\ncontinued existence of bubo-plague in England is, at least, not\r\nsuperfluous, and this will be the best place to bring it in.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Evidence of the Continuance of Plague.\r\n\r\nThe plague was called “the botch” down to the Elizabethan and Stuart\r\nperiods; and the “botches” in Langland’s poem, or, as he writes it,\r\n“boches,” were the familiar risings, under the arms and elsewhere, which\r\nhad given the disease its popular name when it began to recur time after\r\ntime. Apart from this verbal or philological evidence, there is a clear\r\nproof of the prevalence of true bubo-plague during the latter part of the\r\nfourteenth century, in the manuscript ordinances or rules of prevention\r\nand treatment which were in circulation. Most of the extant copies bear\r\nthe name of one John of Burgoyne, or John of Bordeaux[394]. A fragment in\r\ncomparatively late handwriting purports to be the ordinance of “a great\r\nClark, Mr John Cordewe, at the prayer of King Richard and other the Lords,\r\nfor pestilence[395]”; from which it may be concluded that this, the\r\ncommonly used ordinance, dates from the time of Richard II. The names used\r\nin the text are “pestilence” and “pestilential sores,” and the handling of\r\nthe subject is the conventional one for the plague. The ordinance contains\r\nexceedingly little that is of practical interest, and it is difficult to\r\nbelieve that it can have been of real use to anyone. We are introduced to\r\nthe subject with a few empty common-places; but whenever we come to\r\nbusiness, we are plainly told to go and consult those who know--and this,\r\nbe it observed, in a disease which was remarkably uniform in its type and\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\n    “Wherefore they that have not dronken of that swete drynke of\r\n    Astronomye may putte to these pestilentiall sores no fit remedies;\r\n    for, because that they know not the cause and the quality of the\r\n    sickness, they may not hele it, as sayeth the prince of physic\r\n    Avicenna: ‘How shouldest thou hele a sore and yknowe not the cause?’\r\n    He that knoweth not the cause, it is impossible that he hele the\r\n    sickness.”\r\n\r\nIf there were any doubt about the date of John of Burgoyne, or John of\r\nBordeaux[396], it ought to be set at rest by the discovery that he\r\ncorresponds in the closest way with the physician in the Prologue of the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_. Chaucer’s doctor of physic stands for the\r\nwell-grounded practitioner of the time--“grounded in astronomie,” it is\r\ntrue, but at all events academically grounded, in contrast to the\r\ncharlatans and pretenders who had not been to Paris or Bologna, probably\r\nknew no Latin, to say nothing of “astronomy,” and therefore knew not how\r\nto let a patient die (or recover) _secundum artem_. The doctor of physic\r\nuses his astrological knowledge so much in the manner of John of Bordeaux,\r\nthat one suspects Chaucer to have seen the passage quoted above, and to\r\nhave condensed it into the two following lines:\r\n\r\n  “The cause yknowne, and of his harm the rote,\r\n   Anon he gave to the sick man his bote.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the pestilence that this practitioner had made the money which\r\nhe kept so tightly. Richly clad he was;\r\n\r\n  “And yet he was but easy of dispense;\r\n   He kept that he wan in the pestilence.\r\n   For gold in physic is a cordial:\r\n   Therefore he loved gold in special.”\r\n\r\nThis is John of Burgoyne all over; it would have been an anachronism in\r\nEngland by more than two hundred years to have represented a physician as\r\ncaring for any but paying patients, or as regarding an epidemic sickness\r\nfrom any other point of view than as a source of income.\r\n\r\nBesides the “ordinance” of John of Burgoyne, which may be assigned to the\r\nreign of Richard II., there was another essay on the plague circulating in\r\nEngland in an English translation, of which the copy among the Sloane\r\nmanuscripts is assigned to the fourteenth century[397]. The importance\r\nattached to this manuscript work is shown in the fact that it was chosen\r\namong the very first to be printed at an English press, probably in the\r\nyear 1480[398]. It was reprinted in 1536, and the substance of it was\r\ncopied into nearly all the English books on plague (from one to another)\r\nas late as the seventeenth century, much of its original matter passing\r\nunder the name of one Phaer, or Phayre or Thayre, who was a compiler about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century. Writers on early English printing\r\nhave made much of the printed book of 1480; but they do not appear to have\r\nknown of the manuscript which was used as the printer’s “copy[399].” If\r\none happens to use the latter first, and comes later to the printed book,\r\nhe will observe the identity not merely in the words and spelling but even\r\nin the very form in which the type had been cut. The authorship of a\r\nmanuscript which is thus invested with a various interest may deserve a\r\nfew lines of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe author of it describes himself in the (translated) introduction as “I\r\nthe bisshop of Arusiens, Doctour of phisike,” that is to say, bishop of\r\nAarhus, in Denmark. In the text, he claims to have practised physic at\r\nMontpellier:\r\n\r\n    “In the Mount of Pessulane I might not eschewe the company of people,\r\n    for I went from house to house, because of my poverty, to cure sick\r\n    folk. Therefore bread or a sponge sopped in vinegar I took with me,\r\n    holding it to my mouth and nose, because all aigre things stoppen the\r\n    ways of humours and suffereth no venomous thing to enter into a man’s\r\n    body; and so I escaped the pestilence, my fellows supposing that I\r\n    should not live. These foresaid things I have proved by myself[400].”\r\n\r\nThe fact that this medieval treatise, whatever its exact date, was turned\r\ninto English and circulated in manuscript, and that it was chosen for\r\nprinting almost as soon as English printing began, in the reign of Edward\r\nIV., is sufficient evidence, if more were needed, that the English had to\r\nreckon with bubo-plague as one of their standing diseases throughout the\r\nlatter part of the medieval period. Before we come to the chronology of\r\nEnglish plagues in that period, from the Black Death to the accession of\r\nthe Tudor dynasty in 1485, it will be convenient to consider here, with\r\nthe help of the above treatise, how the endemic plague was viewed in those\r\ndays,--what it was ascribed to in its origin, in its incidence upon houses\r\nand persons, and in its propagation, what was advised for its avoidance or\r\nprevention, and what was prescribed for its treatment. As the bishop’s\r\nessay was the source of most that was taught on these matters in England\r\nfor the next two or three hundred years, it will be an economy to give a\r\nbrief account of it here once for all.\r\n\r\nThe remote causes, or warnings of the approach of pestilence, are given\r\nunder seven heads, including the kind of weather, swarms of flies,\r\nshooting stars, comets, thunder and lightning out of the south, and winds\r\nout of the south; this list was reproduced, with little or no change, by\r\nthe Elizabethan writers of popular health-manuals. The second section of\r\nthe essay is on the “causes of pestilence.” There are three causes:--\r\n\r\n    “Sometime it cometh from the root beneath; other while from the root\r\n    above, so that we may feel sensibly howwith change of the air\r\n    appeareth unto us; and sometime it cometh of both together, as well\r\n    from the root above as from the root beneath, as we see a siege or\r\n    privy next to a chamber, or of any other particular thing which\r\n    corrupteth the air in his substance and quality, which is a thing may\r\n    happen every day. And thereof cometh the ague of pestilence (and about\r\n    the same many physicians be deceived, not supposing this ague to be a\r\n    pestilence). Sometimes it cometh of dead carrion, or corruption of\r\n    standing waters in ditches or sloughs and other corrupt places. These\r\n    things sometime be universal, sometime particular.” Then follow\r\n    sentences on the “root above” which are somewhat transcendental. When\r\n    both “roots” work together, when, by “th’ ynp‘ffyons[401]” above, the\r\n    air is corrupt and by the putrefaction or rotten carrion of the vile\r\n    places beneath,--an infirmity is caused in man. “And such infirmity\r\n    sometimes is an ague, sometimes a posthume or a swelling, and that is\r\n    in many things. Also the air inspired sometimes is venomous and\r\n    corrupt, hurting the heart, that nature many ways is grieved, so that\r\n    he perceiveth not his harm....\r\n\r\n    “These things written before are the causes of pestilence. But about\r\n    these things, two questions be mooted. The first is, wherefore one\r\n    dieth and another dieth not, in a town where men be dead in one house\r\n    and in another house there dieth none. The second question is, whether\r\n    pestilence sores be contagious.\r\n\r\n    “To the first question, I say it may hap to be of two causes: that is\r\n    to say, of that thing that doth, and of that thing that suffereth. An\r\n    ensample of that thing that doth: The influence of the bodies above\r\n    beholdeth that place or that place, more than this place or this\r\n    place. And one patient is more disposed to die than another. Therefore\r\n    it is to be noted that bodies be more hot disposed, of open pores,\r\n    than bodies infect having the pores stopped with many humours. Where\r\n    bodies be of resolution or opening, as men which abusen them selfe\r\n    with wymmen, or usen often times bathis; or men that be hot with\r\n    labour or great anger--they have their bodies more disposed to this\r\n    great sickness.\r\n\r\n    “To the second question I say, that pestilence sores be contagious by\r\n    cause of infect humoures bodies, and the reek or smoke of such sores\r\n    is venomous and corrupteth the air. And therefore it is to flee from\r\n    such persons as be infect. In pestilence time nobody should stand in\r\n    great press of people, because some man of them may be infect.\r\n    Therefore wise physicians, in visiting sick folk, stand far from the\r\n    patient, holding their face toward the door or window. And so should\r\n    the servants of sick folk stand. Also it is good to a patient every\r\n    day for to change his chamber, and often times to have the windows\r\n    open against the North and East, and to spar the windows against the\r\n    South. For the south wind hath two causes of putrefaction. The first\r\n    is, it maketh a man, being whole or sick, feeble in their bodies. The\r\n    second cause is, as it is written in the Third of Aphorisms, the south\r\n    wind grieveth the hearing and hurteth the heart, because it openeth\r\n    the pores of man and entereth into the heart. Wherefore it is good to\r\n    an whole man in time of pestilence, when the wind is in the South, to\r\n    keep within the house all the day. And if it shall need a man to go\r\n    out, yet let him abide in his house till the sun be up in the East\r\n    passing southward.”\r\n\r\nThese explanations of the incidence of plague are in part repeated in the\r\nsection of the essay where the author gives directions for avoiding it.\r\nAfter enjoining penance, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “It is a good remedy to void and change the infect place. But some may\r\n    not profitably change their places. Therefore as much as to them is\r\n    possible, it is to be eschewed every cause of putrefaction and\r\n    stinking, and namely every fleshly lust with women is to be eschewed.\r\n    Also the southern wind, which wind is naturally infective: therefore\r\n    spar the windows, etc. Of the same cause, every foul stink is to be\r\n    eschewed--of stable, stinking fields, ways, or streets, and namely of\r\n    stinking dead carrion; and most of stinking waters, where in many\r\n    places water is kept two days or two nights, or else there be gutters\r\n    of water casten under the earth which caused great stink and\r\n    corruption. And of this cause some die in that house where such things\r\n    happen, and in another house die none, as it is said afore. Likewise\r\n    in that place where the worts and coles putrefied, it maketh noifull\r\n    savour and stinking. For in like wise as by the sweet odour of bawme\r\n    the heart and spirits have recreation, so of evil savours they be made\r\n    feeble. Therefore keep your house that an infect air enter not in. For\r\n    an infect air most causeth putrefaction in places and houses where\r\n    folk sleep. Therefore let your house be clean, and make clear fire of\r\n    wood flaming: let your house be made with fumigation of herbs, that is\r\n    to say, with leaves of bay-tree, juniper, yberiorgam--it is in the\r\n    apothecary shops--wormwood etc.... For a little crust corrupteth all\r\n    the body.\r\n\r\n    “Also in the time of the pestilence it is better to abide within the\r\n    house; for it is not wholesome to go into the city or town. Also let\r\n    your house be sprinkled, specially in summer, with vinegar and roses,\r\n    and with the leaves of vine tree. Also it is good to wash your hands\r\n    ofttimes in the day with water and vinegar, and wipe your face with\r\n    your hands, and smell to them. Also it is good always to savour aigre\r\n    things.”\r\n\r\nThen follows his own Montpellier experience, already quoted.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostics come in casually along with the treatment:\r\n\r\n    “But some would understand how may a man feel when he is infect. I say\r\n    that a man which is infect, that day eateth not much meat for he is\r\n    replenished with evil humours; and forthwith after dinner he hath lust\r\n    to sleep, and feeleth great heat under cold. Also he hath great pain\r\n    in the forehead.... He shall feel a swelling under the arm, or about\r\n    the share, or about the ears.... When a man feeleth himself infect, as\r\n    soon as he may, let him be let blood plenteously till he swoon: then\r\n    stop the vein. For a little letting of blood moveth or stirreth\r\n    venom.”\r\n\r\nThen follow directions for bleeding, according to the position of the\r\nbubo--in the armpit, groin or neck, the direction “if on the back”\r\nprobably having reference to the carbuncle[402]. The section on treatment,\r\nwhich is the last, ends with a prescription for a medicine “that the\r\nsooner a swelling be made ripe.”\r\n\r\nThese are sufficiently clear indications of the bubonic nature of the\r\ndisease called pestilence. At the same time the writer includes an ague as\r\nalso pestilential, due to similar causes and arising on similar occasions.\r\nThis is a use of the name ague which should not be mistaken for its common\r\napplication to intermittent fever. Ague was simply (febris) acuta; and\r\npestilential ague was a name for typhus fever in the sixteenth century (as\r\nin Jones’ _Dyall of Agues_), as well as in Ireland until a much later\r\nperiod. This early association of acute pestilential fever with true\r\nbubo-plague means the same relationship of typhus to plague which was\r\nsystematically taught by Sydenham, Willis, and Morton in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; typhus in their time was the frequent attendant of plague,--a\r\n_pestis mitior_; and it would appear to have been its attendant and\r\ncongener in the fourteenth century also.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Century Chronology continued.\r\n\r\nTwo epidemics contend in the chronicles for being the _pestis\r\ntertia_--that of 1368-69, and that of 1375. The former is described as a\r\n“great pestilence of men and the larger animals[403],” and it appears to\r\nhave been associated with unfavourable seasons and with the beginning of\r\nthat scarcity which Langland’s poem refers to the month of April, 1370:\r\n\r\n  Atte Londoun, I leve, liketh wel my wafres\r\n  And louren whan thei lakken hem.--It is nought longe passed,\r\n  There was a careful comune whan no cart cam to towne\r\n  With bred fro Strethforth, tho gan beggeres wepe\r\n  And werkmen were agast a lite. This wole be thought longe\r\n  In the date of our Drighte in a drye Aprille,\r\n  A thousand and thre hondreth tweis thretty and ten\r\n  My wafres there were gesen whan Chichestre was Maire[404].\r\n\r\nThe _pestis_ of 1368 and 1369 may have been primarily a famine-sickness;\r\nbut it does not follow that there was no bubo-plague mixed therewith. On\r\nthe contrary, seasons of scarcity were often in after experience found to\r\nbe the seasons of plague, the lowered vitality probably offering the\r\nopportunity to the plague-virus. Previous to the harvests of 1376 and\r\n1377, which were abundant, there had been an unbroken period of high\r\nprices for many years, of which 1371 was remembered as “the grete dere\r\nyere[405].” But the _pestis tertia_ appears to have been most severe in\r\nthe summer of 1368; for, on 23 July of that year, Simon, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, ordered public prayers for the cessation of the\r\npestilence[406], and it is under the same year that the wills of deceased\r\nLondon citizens are enrolled in unusual numbers, although not in such\r\nnumbers as in the _pestis secunda_ of 1361[407]. Public prayers for the\r\ncessation of pestilence (without reference to famine) and an unusual\r\nmortality of the richer citizens, point to the plague proper, which may or\r\nmay not have been the type of sickness in the country districts in 1369,\r\nthe second year of the epidemic[408].\r\n\r\nThere is, furthermore, some indirect evidence that pestilential disease,\r\nand probably bubo-plague, occurred in London subsequent to the scarcity of\r\nthe dry April, 1370, to which Langland’s verses relate. This evidence lies\r\nin the comparison of the wording of two ordinances of Edward III., one of\r\n1369 and the other of 1371, both relating to nuisances in the city[409].\r\nIn an order of the king in Council (43 Edward III.) for stopping the\r\ncarrying of slaughter-house offal from the shambles in St Nicholas parish,\r\nwithin Newgate, through the streets, lanes, and other places to the banks\r\nof the water of Thames near to Baynard’s Castle, where there was a jetty\r\nfor throwing the refuse from into the river, the motive assigned is that\r\ndivers prelates, nobles, and other persons having houses in the line of\r\ntraffic, had complained grievously of these offences to the sight and\r\nsmell. But, in an amended order of 28th October, 1371, against the same\r\nnuisance and with a definite (but futile) relegation of all slaughtering\r\nto Stratford on the one side and Knightsbridge on the other, the motive is\r\ndifferently stated: “Whereas of late, from the putrefied blood of\r\nslaughtered beasts running in the streets, and the entrails thereof thrown\r\ninto the water of Thames, the air in the same city has been greatly\r\ncorrupted and infected, and whereby the worst of abominations and\r\nstenches have been generated, and sicknesses and many other maladies have\r\nbefallen persons dwelling in the same city and resorting thereto:--We,\r\ndesiring to take precautions against such perils, and to provide for the\r\ndecency of the said city, and the safety of the same our people” etc.\r\n\r\nUp to this date, the Rolls of Parliament contain frequent references to\r\nthe wasting and impoverishment of the country by pestilence. A petition of\r\n1362 begs the king “to consider the divers mischiefs that have come to his\r\ncommons by divers pestilences of wind and water, and mortality of men and\r\nbeasts”--the destructive wind being the tornado-like storm, on the 16th\r\nJanuary, 1362, “on Saturday at even,” which was long remembered, and is\r\ncommemorated, along with the Black Death itself, in an inscription in the\r\nchurch of Ashwell, Herts. Next year, another petition states that\r\n“pestilences and great winds have done divers mischiefs”--manors and\r\ntenements held direct from the king having become desolate and ruinous. In\r\n1369 a petition states that “the king’s ferms [rents] in every county of\r\nEngland are greatly abated by the great mortalities.” The parliament of\r\n1376, the “good Parliament” so-called, is able to point the moral of its\r\npetitions by frequent references to the pestilences “that have been in the\r\nkingdom one after another,” the pestilences “of people and servants,” the\r\nmurrains of cattle, and “the failure of their corn and other fruits of the\r\nearth.” The same language recurs in the second parliament of Richard II.\r\nin 1378 (the year after the poll-tax), and from that time until the end of\r\nhis reign, it becomes stereotyped in the petitions deprecating heavy\r\nsubsidies or excusing the smallness of the sums voted.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence of 1375 would appear to have been considered as one of the\r\ngreater sort. The author of the _Eulogium_ reckons it the _pestis tertia_\r\n(passing over that of 1368-69). The season was one of great heat, there\r\nwas “grandis pestilentia” both in England and other countries, an infinity\r\nof both sexes died, the mortality being so swift that the pope, “at the\r\ninstance of the cardinal of England” granted plenary remission to all\r\ndying contrite and confessing their sins[410]. That looks like an\r\nepidemic of true bubo-plague,--probably the _pestis quarta_ correctly\r\nso-called[411].\r\n\r\nIn 1379 there was a great plague in the Northern parts, which were\r\nstripped of their best men; the Scots made a raid, with the following\r\nprayer on their lips: “God and Sen Mungo, Sen Ninian and Seynt Andrew\r\nscheld us this day and ilka day fro Goddis grace, and the foule deth that\r\nYnglessh men dyene upon”--foul death being the name given to plague also\r\nin 1349[412]. The northern counties send a petition to the parliament of\r\n1379-80, that the king would “consider the very great hurt and damage\r\nwhich they have suffered, and are still suffering, both by pestilence and\r\nby the continual devastations of the Scots enemy[413].”\r\n\r\nIn the parliament of 1381-82 there is a petition from the convent of\r\nSalisbury as to want of money to repair the losses caused by the\r\npestilence, of which the tenants are nearly all dead, and by the murrain\r\nof cattle. This is more than thirty years from the Black Death, and can\r\nhardly refer, as some earlier petitions may have done, to the enduring\r\neffects of that calamity. The sixth parliament of Richard II. (1382), has\r\ntwo of the stereotyped petitions deprecating a heavy subsidy on the ground\r\nof “the great poverty and disease” of the commons, through pestilence of\r\npeople, murrain of cattle, failure of crops, great floods, etc.[414] This\r\nwas the year after the Peasant Revolt, which had coincided with troubles\r\nof various kinds. A Norwich chronicle, perhaps of contemporary authority,\r\nenters, under the year 1382, a very pestilential fever in many places of\r\nthe country, and very extraordinary inundations of the fens[415]. In\r\nLondon the epidemic of 1382 is said to have been “chiefly among boys and\r\ngirls[416].” A primitive English poem of the time has for its subject the\r\nearthquake of 1382, and with that portent it associates not only the\r\nPeasant’s Rebellion but also “the pestilens[417].”\r\n\r\nThe year 1383 was a bad one for the fruit, which was spoiled by “foetid\r\nfogs, exhalations and various corruptions of the air”: from eating of the\r\nspoiled fruits many died, or incurred serious illness and\r\ninfirmities[418]. By another account, a great pestilence in Kent and other\r\nparts of England destroyed many, sparing no age or sex. In Norfolk the\r\nsickness that year is said to have been confined to young persons[419].\r\nThis was only one of the occasions which might have been referred to in\r\n‘Piers Ploughman,’ when the poor people thought to “poison Hunger” by bad\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe next pestilence, that of 1390 and 1391, was so prolonged and so\r\nserious as to be compared with the Great Mortality itself. It is called\r\nthe _pestis quinta_ by two annalists[420], and is described not without\r\nsome detail by several. It is clear that the seeds of disease were ready\r\nto burst forth at various parts of the country; for we read that in 1389,\r\nthe king was in the south of England, and seeing some of his men\r\nprostrated by sudden death, he returned to Windsor[421]. Another outburst\r\ncame the year after. Intense heat began in June and lasted until\r\nSeptember; great mortality ensued, the epidemic continuing in diverse\r\nparts of England, but not everywhere, until Michaelmas; it cut off more\r\nyoung than old, as well as several famous soldiers[422]. The St Albans\r\nentry confirms this: “A great plague, especially of youths and children,\r\nwho died everywhere in towns and villages, in incredible and excessive\r\nnumbers[423].” After the epidemic there was scarcity, of which we have\r\nspecial accounts from Norfolk[424]. But the heaviest mortality fell in the\r\nyear 1391. There was first of all scarcity, now in its second year, and\r\naggravated by six weeks of continual gloom in July and August. At the time\r\nof the nuts, apples and other fruits of the kind, many poor people died of\r\ndysentery, and the sickness would have been worse but for the laudable\r\ncare of the mayor of London who caused corn to be brought from over sea.\r\nIn Norfolk and many other counties the sickness was compared even to the\r\nGreat Mortality, and was probably a mixture of famine-pestilence with\r\nbubo-plague. At York “eleven thousand” were said to have been buried[425].\r\nAnother account says that the North suffered severely, and also the West,\r\nand that the sickness lasted all summer[426]. Under the year 1393 one\r\nannalist states that many died in Essex in September and October, “on the\r\npestilence setting in[427].” The next evidence comes from the Rolls of\r\nParliament; in the first parliament of Henry IV. (1399) a petition is\r\npresented “that the king would graciously consider the great pestilence\r\nwhich is in the northern parts,” and send sufficient men to defend the\r\nScots marches.\r\n\r\nThe first great outburst of plague in the fifteenth century falls\r\nsomewhere between 1405 and 1407. “So great pestilence,” says the St Albans\r\nannalist, under the year 1407, “had not been seen for many years.” In\r\nLondon “thirty thousand men and women” are reported to have died in a\r\nshort space; and “in country villages the sickness fell so heavily upon\r\nthe wretched peasants that many homes that had before been gladdened by a\r\nnumerous family were left almost empty[428].” But it is under the 7th of\r\nHenry IV. (1405) that Hall’s chronicle narrates how the king, to avoid the\r\ncity on account of the plague, sailed from Queenborough to a port in\r\nEssex, and so to Plashey, “there to pass his time till the plague were\r\nceased” (p. 36). Another chronicle says that the plague of 1407 was mostly\r\nin the West country. In that year, the 9th of Henry IV., there is a\r\npetition from Ilchester in Somerset for a remission of dues “because the\r\ntown is so impoverished and desolate of people that the burgesses are\r\nunable to pay the said ferme,” and for the cancelling of all arrears due\r\nsince the 43rd year of Edward III. (1369). In the 11th of Henry IV.\r\n(1410-11), the burgesses of Truro represent “that the said town is\r\nimpoverished by pestilence and the death of men, and by invasions and loss\r\nby the enemy by sea, and by the surcharge of twelve lives, and by default\r\nof inhabitants in the said town”--a petition apparently similar in terms\r\nto one that had been submitted in the previous reign. In the 1st of Henry\r\nIV. (1399), petitions of the same kind had been presented from Lincoln and\r\nYarmouth; the former was “in great part empty and uninhabited,” while the\r\nlatter had “its houses vacant and void, owing to pestilence and other\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nFor the year 1413 there is a brief entry that “numbers of Englishmen were\r\nstruck by plague and ceased to live[429].” A single chronicler mentions a\r\npestilence in Norfolk in 1420[430]; but the Rolls of Parliament bear\r\nundoubted witness to a very severe prevalence of plague in the North about\r\nthe same time: a petition from the Marches in 1421 speaks of “great\r\nnumbers of persons dead by the great mortalities and pestilences which\r\nhave raged for three years past and still reign; where a hundred men used\r\nto be there are not ten, and these of small account; where people of\r\nposition kept twenty men at arms they now keep only themselves”; the enemy\r\nwere making raids and food was scarce[431]. Another petition the same year\r\n(9 Henry V.) states that “both by pestilence within the realm and wars\r\nwithout there are not sufficient men of estate to hold the office of\r\nsheriff[432].” That was shortly after Agincourt and the conquest of\r\nFrance, when the fortunes of Henry V. were at their highest point. The\r\nhorrors of the siege of Rouen (1419) were a favourite subject with poets\r\nof the time[433], but they were of a kind foreign to English experience in\r\nthat age, and, indeed, in all periods of our history, save that of the\r\nDanish invasions. The Cromwellian Civil Wars, as we shall see, do indeed\r\nfurnish many instances of plague, and some of typhus fever, in besieged or\r\noccupied towns; but, for the middle part of the fifteenth century,\r\nincluding the period of the wars of York and Lancaster, there is no good\r\nreason to suppose that fevers or other _morbi miseriae_, were rife among\r\nthe common people, least of all among the peasantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Public Health in the Fifteenth Century.\r\n\r\nOur safest indications are got from the prices of commodities and the\r\nrates of wages, and these, according to the most competent authority,\r\nThorold Rogers, were more favourable to the working class in the fifteenth\r\ncentury than at other periods: “As the agriculturist throve in the\r\nfifteenth century, so the mechanic and the artisan was also prosperous.\r\nThis was the age in which the property of the guilds was generally\r\nacquired.” On famines in particular, I shall quote one other passage,\r\nwhich entirely confirms the view that I had independently stated in the\r\nfirst chapter when speaking of Ergotism:\r\n\r\n    “Famine, in the strict sense of the word, has rarely occurred in\r\n    England, owing to the practice which the inhabitants of this island\r\n    have persistently maintained of living mainly on the dearest kind of\r\n    corn.... The people lived abundantly, and, except when extraordinary\r\n    scarcity occurred, regularly on the best provision which could be\r\n    procured[434].”\r\n\r\nOne such period of extraordinary scarcity all over England fell in the\r\nyears 1438-39. The chronicle of Croyland says that there were three wet\r\nharvests in succession, that famine had been almost constant for two\r\nyears, and that the people were reduced to eating dried herbs and\r\nroots[435]. That would have been a famine of the old kind, like those of\r\n1258 and 1315, wheat having touched 20_s._ But it should not lead us to\r\nsuppose that the disastrous period of the end of Edward III.’s reign and\r\nof the reign of Richard II. was continued throughout the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is true that the records of that century are scantier than for\r\nearlier periods; the monastic chronicles have all ceased, except those of\r\nSt Albans and Croyland, and the citizens’ diaries, which took their place,\r\nhave hardly begun. It is possible that a fuller record would have shown a\r\ngreater prevalence of distress throughout the country. It is probably\r\nowing to the scantiness of the history that the views of the fifteenth\r\ncentury range from the extreme of optimism to the extreme of pessimism.\r\nWhere little is known, much may be imagined. Thus, a recent writer on\r\n_England in the Fifteenth Century_[436], says that “all attempts to\r\nspecify the years of scarcity would only mislead”; and again: “There is\r\nhardly any period of five years during that time [15th century] without\r\nthese ghastly records.” Another recent writer[437] remarks upon the\r\nfifteenth century being called a time of rude plenty, and sets against\r\nthat “the famines, the plagues, the skin-diseases, the miserable quality\r\nof the food, the insecurity of life and property, the hovels in which the\r\npeople lived, and the tyranny and oppression of a time of unsettled\r\ngovernment.” It is needless to controvert the merely subjective impression\r\nin an author’s mind. But, in order to clear our ideas, let us take these\r\nthings one by one. What were firstly the famines? There is no great one\r\nbut that of 1438-39, which was due to a succession of wet harvests, and\r\nwas equally severe in Scotland and in France, having in them caused\r\nfamine-sickness as well as plague. Of the plagues, which were certainly no\r\nworse than in the Elizabethan and Stuart times, I shall speak in detail\r\nalmost at once. Of the skin-diseases, there is nowhere a word said:\r\nanother writer[438] specifies leprosy as afflicting England “all over the\r\ncountry” in the fifteenth century, whereas it can be shown that the\r\nprevalence of that disease, such as it had ever been in England, had\r\nalmost ceased, and its sentimental vogue passed, in the reign of Edward\r\nIII. The miserable quality of the food and the wretched hovels have\r\ncertainly no special relevancy to the period[439]; on the contrary, the\r\npicture that we get of the manor of Castle Combe in the fifteenth century\r\nis that of a prosperous community, although not a highly moral one. As to\r\ninsecurity of life and property, and oppression of government, there seems\r\nto be some illusion because the time was that of the wars of York and\r\nLancaster. But we have the significant observation of Philip de Comines, a\r\ncontemporary French statesman who kept his eye on the state of other\r\ncountries; writing of the effects of civil war, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “England has this peculiar grace that neither the country, nor the\r\n    people, nor the houses are wasted or demolished; but the calamities\r\n    and misfortunes of the war fall only upon the soldiers and especially\r\n    the nobility, of whom they are more than ordinarily jealous: for\r\n    nothing is perfect in this world.”\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that the middle part of the fifteenth century was\r\nreally the time “ere England’s woes began, when every rood of ground\r\nmaintained its man,” and that the Golden Age came to an end as soon as the\r\ndynastic and aristocratic quarrel was ended, and the nobles left free to\r\nturn their attention to their lapsing feudal rights. It is then that we\r\nbegin to hear of enclosures, of adding house to house and field to field,\r\nof huge sheep-farms with no labourers on the soil, and of deserted\r\nvillages. Goldsmith meant it of his own time; but Auburn flourishing\r\nbelonged to the fifteenth century, and Auburn deserted was a common\r\nEnglish experience in the time of Henry VIII. It is just because the\r\nfifteenth century is bounded on either side by periods of known distress\r\namong the commons, and is itself without a history, that one thinks of it\r\nas happy; and that view of it is borne out by the economic history which\r\nhas been laboriously constructed for it.\r\n\r\nSo much being premised of the country’s well-being at large, we may now\r\nreturn to the particular records of epidemics of plague.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology of Plagues in the Fifteenth Century.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of an undoubted reference to influenza epidemic all\r\nover England in 1427 (a year of its prevalence in France also), which I\r\nshall postpone to a future chapter, the history down to the arrival of the\r\nsweating sickness in 1485, is concerned almost exclusively with notices of\r\nplague, and of plague mostly in the towns. It cannot be maintained that\r\nrural districts were exempt, or that some great epidemics of plague did\r\nnot fall on town and country alike. Thus, the St Albans annalist, under\r\nthe year 1431, has an entry of “pestilence at Codycote and divers places\r\nof this domain in this year.” Again, in 1439, the Rolls of Parliament\r\ncontain a petition to the king “how that a sickness called the Pestilence\r\nuniversally through this your realm more commonly reigneth than hath been\r\nusual before this time, the which is an infirmity most infective, and the\r\npresence of such so infect must be eschewed, as by noble Fisisseanes and\r\nwise Philosofors before this time plainly it hath been determined, and as\r\nexperience daily showeth”--therefore to omit the ceremony of kissing the\r\nking in doing knightly service, “and the homage to be as though they\r\nkissed you.” That may have been a plague both of town and country during\r\nfamine, comparable to the epidemic of 1407, which, as “Walsingham”\r\nexpressly says, was severely felt in the homes of the peasantry as well as\r\nin London. But plague henceforth is seldom universal; it becomes more and\r\nmore a disease of the towns, and when it does occur in the country, it is\r\nfor the most part at some few limited spots. A Paston letter of the years\r\nbetween 1461 and 1466 gives us a glimpse of the sort of the incidence of\r\nplague in country places, and of the avoidance of such infected spots,\r\nwhich we shall find often mentioned in the documents of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries[440]. There is, of course, no means of estimating\r\nthe frequency of plague in these almost sporadic circumstances. The\r\ndisease must have had its seats of election in the country, but we may\r\nsafely conclude that these, after the Black Death and the recurrences\r\nthereof down, say, to 1407, were much fewer than in the towns. One\r\nsignificant piece of evidence comes from the great monastery of\r\nCanterbury. Among its records is an obituary, on twenty sheets, of all the\r\nmonks from 1286 to 1517. Out of a hundred cases taken without selection\r\nfrom the record, there died, of pestilence, 33; of phthisis, 10; of\r\nchronic diseases, 29. “Pestilence” appears to mean specifically\r\nbubo-plague; for we find besides, among the sample hundred, two deaths\r\nfrom flux, one of these corpses having been buried immediately _propter\r\ninfexionem_. The inference, under correction from further inquiry, would\r\nbe that one-third of the deaths in the monastery of Canterbury during the\r\nfirst half of the reign of plague in England were from that disease. And\r\nthat was in a monastery which, in the Black Death itself, is reported, in\r\nthe same record, to have lost “only four” out of a membership of about\r\neighty[441].\r\n\r\nIt remains to enumerate briefly the known instances of plague in London or\r\nother towns, from the last date given (1420) down to the beginning of the\r\nTudor period (1485). Its prevalence “in England,” but more probably in\r\nLondon only, in 1426, comes out in a letter from the Senate of Venice\r\ncautioning the captain of the Flanders galleys and the vice-captain of the\r\nLondon galleys[442]. We hear also of that plague in London owing to the\r\nfact that certain Scotsmen of rank, hostages for the ransom of the king of\r\nScots, died of the plague in London. An envoy who proceeded to Scotland on\r\n12th March, 1427, was instructed to ask that the dead hostages be replaced\r\nby others of equal rank; and if the king of Scots objected on the ground\r\nthat they had died because they had been kept in places where the late\r\npestilence raged, notwithstanding their request to be removed, the envoy\r\nwas to say that the hostages had been kept in London, where the dukes of\r\nBedford and Gloucester and all other lords of the Council remained during\r\nthe time; and that the hostages were “neither pinned nor barred up” in any\r\nhouse, but went at large in the city, and might have taken any measures\r\nthey pleased for their own preservation. It appears, however, that the\r\ncouncil removed from the city, and that the courts were adjourned, at a\r\nstage of the epidemic subsequent to the deaths of the Scots. The last plea\r\nof the envoy was that, supposing the pestilence had prevailed throughout\r\nEngland, the king was not therefore bound to send the hostages out of\r\nEngland; from which hypothetical construction, we may conclude that the\r\nepidemic was special to London--one of a long series requiring the king’s\r\nCourt, the Parliament, and the Law Courts to be adjourned[443].\r\n\r\nIn 1433, the Parliament which met at Westminster on the 8th July, was\r\nprorogued on the 15th August, on account of the _gravis pestilentia_ which\r\nbegan to arise in London and the suburbs[444]. A London chronicler enters,\r\nunder the 12th of Henry VI. (1433) “a grete pestilence and a grete frost,”\r\na conjunction that would be interesting if the hard winter had\r\npreceded[445]. The plague revived in London in the following autumn; for,\r\non the 27th October, 1434, the Privy Council ordered all pleas then\r\npending to be continued from the morrow of All Souls to the octaves of St\r\nHilary on account of the epidemic[446]. After three years, in 1437, the\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas paid a visit to St Albans Abbey and\r\nremained there some time, “on account of the epidemic plague which was\r\nthen reigning in the city of London[447].” Two years after, 1439, comes\r\nthe entry in the Rolls of Parliament, already quoted, with reference to\r\nomitting the ceremony of kissing the king, because “a sickness called the\r\nPestilence universally through this your realm more commonly reigneth than\r\nhath been usual before this time, the which is an infirmity most\r\ninfective[448].” Thus we have in the decade from 1430 to 1440 no fewer\r\nthan four distinct outbreaks of plague, three of them confined to the city\r\nof London, and one of them, that of 1439, general throughout the realm.\r\nThe last was “a sickness called the pestilence,” which should mean the\r\nbubo-plague. The year was one of great distress abroad, many thousands\r\nhaving died in Paris. It was a year of famine in Scotland, where the\r\ndisease was undoubtedly dysentery in part; but the information from\r\nScotland (given in the sequel) points to the true plague supervening on\r\nthe other. There was famine in England at the time when it was in France\r\nand in Scotland, so that the type of sickness may have been, in England\r\nalso, fever and dysentery first and plague afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1444, on the 5th of June, the Rolls contain the entry that grave\r\npestilence began to arise. A severe pestilence is reported at Oxford in\r\n1448[449]. On the 30th May, 1449, Parliament is adjourned to Winchester\r\nto avoid “the corrupt and infected airs” of Westminster. On the 6th\r\nNovember of the same year it adjourns to Ludgate, in the city of London,\r\nowing to the infection of the air in Westminster. The infected state of\r\nWestminster and other places around is again the subject of an entry on\r\nthe 4th December, with this addition: “it has been sufficiently decreed as\r\nto avoiding and extinguishing the said corrupt and infectious air.” About\r\nthree months later, on 30th March, 1450, Parliament adjourns to Leicester\r\non account of the insalubrity of the air at Westminster. In 1452 it\r\nadjourns on 20th November to Reading for the same reason, but is soon\r\nafter adjourned to the 11th February, owing to plague in Reading\r\nitself:--“de magna mortalitate in dicta villa de Redyng jam regnante.”\r\nThese years must have been a really severe plague-period, for we find in\r\n1454, a reference in the Paston Letters to the alarm caused by the plague\r\nin London. Wm. Paston writes to John Paston, 6 September: “Sergeant-at-law\r\nBilling came to London this week. He sent for me and asked me how I fared.\r\nI told him, here is pestilence, and said I fared the better he was in good\r\nhele, for it was noised that he was dead.... Here is great pestilence. I\r\npurpose to flee into the country[450].”\r\n\r\nFrom 1454 (and the year following in Scotland) there is a clear interval\r\nof ten years without mention of plague in the not very complete records of\r\nthe time. With the year 1464 there began a series of outbreaks of plague\r\nwhich appear to have lasted in one part of the country or another with few\r\nintermissions until 1478. This plague-period is said to have been foretold\r\nin a remarkable prophecy. In the year 1462 a boy at Cambridge, while\r\nwalking in a lane between King’s College and the adjoining buildings of\r\nClare and Trinity Halls, met an old man with a long beard, who addressed\r\nhim thus: “Go now and tell to anyone that within these two years there\r\nwill be such pestilence, and famine, and slaughter of men, as no one\r\nliving has seen.” Having said this he disappeared. Doubts however, were\r\nat once thrown on the reality of these words; for the boy, on being\r\nquestioned by Master Myleton, doctor of theology, and others, said that he\r\nneither saw the old man walking on the ground nor heard him speak[451].\r\n\r\nThe authentic intelligence of plague in England in 1464 is contained in a\r\nletter to the Seignory of Venice from Bruges, dated 5th October, 1464, to\r\nthe effect that some Venetian merchants have arrived from London, which\r\nthey had quitted on the 26th September. They say the plague is at work\r\nthere at the rate of two hundred [deaths] per diem, “and thus writes\r\n[also] Carlo Ziglio.” In April next year, 1465, we hear of it still in\r\nLondon, through a casual reference in a letter written by one of the\r\nPaston family[452]; and as prevailing all over England, through a formal\r\nentry in the chronicle of Croyland, the last of the monastic records which\r\ncontinued to be kept. There was an infection of the air, we read, in the\r\nwhole of England, so that many thousands of people of every age came to\r\ntheir death suddenly, like sheep slaughtered[453].\r\n\r\nThe very next year, 1466, Parliament is adjourned from Westminster on\r\naccount of the infection in London, to meet at Reading. Next summer, 1st\r\nJuly, 1467, there is another adjournment to Reading (6 November), because\r\nof the heat and because the plague was beginning to reign, by which\r\ncertain members of the House of Commons had been cut off. After an\r\ninterval of four years we hear of plague, in a Paston letter, and by a\r\nSouthwell record. On 2 August, 1471, the residentiary canons of Southwell\r\nMinster vote themselves leave of absence for a month “quia regnat morbus\r\npestiferus in villa Southwell, et furit excessivé morbus pestiferus[454].”\r\nOn 13 September, 1471, Sir John Paston writes from near Winchester: “I\r\ncannot hear by pilgrims that pass the country, nor none other man that\r\nrideth or goeth any country, that any borough town in England is free from\r\nthat sickness. God cease it when it please him!” Apart from London the\r\nEnglish town which has the most disastrous record for this period is\r\nHull[455]. The plague was so severe there, in three epidemics close\r\ntogether, as almost to ruin the place. It broke out in 1472, and had swept\r\noff a great number of the inhabitants before the end of the year,\r\nincluding the mayor. In 1476 it broke out afresh, causing a great\r\nmortality. In 1478 it was more violent than ever, the number of its\r\nvictims being given as 1580, including the mayor and all his family; the\r\npeople fled the town, the church was shut up, and the streets deserted and\r\ngrass-grown. The epidemic appears to have been, as usual, an autumnal one,\r\nceasing at the approach of winter. Meanwhile, in 1474, there is mention of\r\na serious prevalence of plague in the Royal household, as well as\r\nelsewhere in London. The weather of the previous autumn, 1473, had been\r\nremarkable. Labourers are said to have died in the harvest-field from the\r\nexcessive heat, and “fervues, axes, and the bloody flyx” (fevers, agues,\r\nand dysentery) to have been universal in divers parts of England; but\r\nthere was no dearth. The unusual character of that season, or of the\r\nseason preceding, was indicated by the bursting forth of underground\r\nreservoirs of water[456].\r\n\r\nThe great plague of this period in London should most probably be placed\r\nunder the years 1478-9. Merely to show the difficulties of the chronology\r\nit may be worth while citing the various accounts. The Greyfriars’\r\nChronicle says, under the year 17 Edward IV., that the term was “deferred\r\nfrom Ester to Michaelmas because of the grete pestylens[457].” The 17th of\r\nEdward IV. was 1477. But Fabyan, who was now a citizen of London\r\n(afterwards sheriff and alderman), enters it under the civic year 1478-79,\r\nor the year which begins for him with the new lord mayor taking office on\r\n30 October. His words are: “This year was great mortality and death in\r\nLondon and many other parts of this realm, the which began in the latter\r\nend of Senii [September] in the preceding year and continued in this year\r\ntill the beginning of November, in the which passed time died innumerable\r\npeople in the said city and many places elsewhere[458].” Grafton says,\r\nunder the year 1478, that the chief mortality fell in four months of great\r\nheat, during which the pestilence was so fierce and quick that fifteen\r\nyears’ war had not consumed a third as many people[459]. To reconcile\r\nthese dates we should have to take the year of the Greyfriars’ Chronicle\r\nas 1478, so that the adjournment of the term from Easter to Michaelmas,\r\nmight suit the four months in Grafton. At the same time, Fabyan’s\r\nstatement that the plague “continued in this year till November,” is\r\ncorrect for 1479. Sir John Paston writes home from London, 29 Oct. 1479,\r\nof his danger from the sickness; he died there on 15th November; and his\r\nbrother, who came up from Norfolk to bury him, writes to his mother, who\r\nwished him “to haste out of the air that he was in,” that the sickness is\r\n“well ceased” in December.\r\n\r\nThe year 1478, the first of two plague-seasons in London, was also a year\r\nof plague at Hull, and at Newcastle and Southwell. The account for\r\nNewcastle, in its annals under 1478, is merely that great numbers died of\r\nthe plague[460]. At Southwell, on 5 July, 1478, the canons residentiary\r\nagain take leave of absence for the summer, “because it may be probably\r\nestimated that the dire pestilential affliction in the town of Southwell\r\nwill continue, and because the venerable men, with their domestics, have a\r\njust fear of incurring the infection of the said pestiferous\r\naffliction[461].” Next year, 1479, an “incredible number” died of plague\r\nat Norwich[462], and at villages like Swainsthorp, where “they have died\r\nand been sick nigh in every house[463].”\r\n\r\nThus in two years, 1478-79, we hear of an epidemic of plague of the first\r\nrank in London, an epidemic most severe for the size of the place, at\r\nHull, and epidemics at Southwell, Newcastle and Norwich. This is not\r\nunlike the plague-years that we often find in the centuries following.\r\nWhether it be that we are merely coming to a time of better records, or\r\nthat the disease itself was getting worse in English towns, these later\r\nyears of Edward IV. are comparable to plague-periods under the Tudors and\r\nthe Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe period from the Black Death of 1349 to the reign of Edward IV.\r\nwitnesses a considerable change in the habits, so to speak, of plague in\r\nEngland. In the earlier part of that period, the epidemics of\r\n“pestilence”--although they were not all of plague or wholly of\r\nplague--are general throughout England, like the great mortality itself\r\nbut on a smaller scale. As late as 1407, or perhaps 1439, we still hear of\r\n“the disease called the pestilence” being universal and in the homes of\r\nthe peasantry. The extent of the sickness in 1465, or even the type of it,\r\nis not sufficiently known. From that time onwards town and country are\r\ncontrasted in the matter of plague; it becomes usual to flee to the\r\ncountry so as to escape the pestilential air in town in the summer heats,\r\nand the unwholesomeness of the London air becomes on numerous occasions a\r\nreal reason, or a pretext, for the adjournment of Parliament. All the\r\nwhile, the plague was the lineal descendant of the Black Death,--a virus\r\nso potent on its first entry into English soil as to overrun every parish\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague and other pestilences in Scotland and Ireland, 1349-1475.\r\n\r\nThe materials for the history of plague in Scotland, including the Black\r\nDeath and subsequent outbreaks down to the end of the medieval period, are\r\nmuch fewer than for England. From the English chroniclers (Knighton and Le\r\nBaker) we learn that the Black Death in the autumn of 1349 extended from\r\nthe northern counties to the Scots army in the Forest of Selkirk.\r\nAccording to Fordoun, plague would have been general in Scotland in 1350;\r\nbut as he includes in his reference “several years before and after” and\r\n“divers parts of the world,” his statement that nearly a third part of the\r\nhuman race paid the debt of nature is perhaps a mere echo of the general\r\nestimate and without reference specially to Scotland[464]. His next\r\ngeneral reference to pestilence is under the year 1362, when the same\r\nkind of disease and the same extent of mortality as in 1350 occurred\r\nthroughout all Scotland[465]. But as he says elsewhere that the visit of\r\nDavid, king of Scots, to Aberdeenshire in 1361, when he took Kildrummy\r\nCastle from the earl of Mar, was determined in the first instance by the\r\nprevalence of plague in the southern part of his kingdom[466], it may be\r\ninferred that the epidemic had begun late in that year in the south,\r\ncoincident with the _pestis secunda_ of England, and had been interrupted\r\nby the coming on of winter, as in the first epidemic of 1349 and 1350. The\r\nnext mortality recorded by Fordoun he names the fourth (_quarta\r\nmortalitas_) and assigns to 1401[467]. The question arises as to the\r\nthird; and it appears that there were indeed two plague-years in Scotland\r\nbetween 1362 and 1401--namely, 1380 and 1392, both of them corresponding\r\nnearly to great plagues in the north of England. In the former year sir\r\nJohn Lyon, lord of Glamis, was unable to hold his court as auditor of the\r\nexchequer in certain places owing to the plague[468]. In 1392, also, the\r\ncustumars of Haddington, Peebles, and Dumbarton did not attend the\r\n“chamberlain ayres” on account of the pestilence[469]. In 1402 (not in\r\n1401, as Fordoun has it), the custumars of Stirling were absent from the\r\naudit by reason of the plague[470]; and in the same financial year (10\r\nJuly, 1402, to 18 July, 1403), only one bailie from Dundee attended the\r\naudit at Perth, the others being dead in the pestilence[471].\r\n\r\nFor a whole generation there is no documentary evidence of plague in\r\nScotland. But Fordoun has two entries of a disease which he calls\r\n_pestilentia volatilis_--it can hardly have been plague and may have been\r\ninfluenza--the one in 1430, having begun at Edinburgh in February, and the\r\nother in 1432 at Haddington[472].\r\n\r\nUnder the year 1439, an old chronicle, _Ane Addicioun of Scottis\r\nCornicklis and Deidis_ records one of those seasons of famine and\r\ndysentery or lientery, with some more sudden sickness, which have been\r\ndescribed for England in a former chapter. “The samen time there was in\r\nScotland a great dearth, for the boll of wheat was at 40_s._, and the boll\r\nof ait meal 30_s._; and verily the dearth was sae great that there died a\r\npassing [number of] people for hunger. And als the land-ill, the wame-ill,\r\nwas so violent, that there died mae that year than ever there died, owther\r\nin pestilence, or yet in ony other sickness in Scotland. And that samen\r\nyear the pestilence came in Scotland, and began at Dumfries, and it was\r\ncallit the _Pestilence but Mercy_, for there took it nane that ever\r\nrecoverit, but they died within twenty-four hours[473].” Here the\r\n“land-ill” or “wame-ill” (dysentery or lientery) is contrasted within “the\r\npestilence,” which latter is said to have supervened the same year,\r\nbeginning at Dumfries and proving peculiarly deadly. This was a year of\r\nplague, said to be “universal,” in England (where famine also was severe),\r\nand of an enormous mortality in France.\r\n\r\nThe continuator of Fordoun records under the year 1455 (James II.) a great\r\npestilential mortality of men through the whole kingdom, an epidemic which\r\nwould be again a year behind the corresponding plague in England[474]. We\r\nhear of it next definitely in the year 1475, which falls within the series\r\nof plague-years at Hull, and elsewhere in the southern part of the island.\r\nOn account of an outbreak of pestilence the king of Scots adjourned the\r\nmeeting of the estates from September 1475 to the Epiphany following[475],\r\nwhen the Parliament actually met. The same year there was a\r\nplague-hospital on Inchkeith, in the Firth of Forth, and not for the first\r\ntime; ten marts from the Orkneys were landed there for the quarantined\r\npatients[476].\r\n\r\nThe references to plague in Scotland begin again about the year 1498; but\r\nthese, according to the division of our subject, will come into another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe references to plagues in Ireland after the invasion of 1349 are\r\nextremely meagre; but they make it probable that outbursts of bubo-plague\r\nrecurred at intervals, as well as occasional epidemics of flux and other\r\ndiseases brought on by scarcity or bad corn. The continuators of Clyn’s\r\nKilkenny annals enumerate various _pestes_--_secunda_, _tertia_, _quarta_\r\nand _quinta_--just as the English annalists do. The _secunda_ falls in\r\n1362, its season in Scotland also[477]. The _tertia_ is given under 1373;\r\nbut also under 1370[478]. The _quarta_ is in 1382 (or 1385), and the\r\n_quinta_ in 1391. But there is little or no independent evidence that this\r\nchronology, originally made for England, is really good for Ireland also.\r\nThe only other entry, until the Tudor period, is “fames magna in Hibernia”\r\nin 1410[479].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SWEATING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strange disease which came to be known all over Europe as _sudor\r\nAnglicus_, or the English Sweat, was a new type or species of infection\r\nfirst seen in the autumn of 1485. Polydore Virgil, an Italian scholar and\r\nman of affairs, who arrived in England in 1501, became, in effect, the\r\ncourt historian of Henry VII.’s reign, and of the events which led up to\r\nthe overthrow of Richard III. at Bosworth Field on the 22nd of August\r\n1485; his account of the movements of Henry Tudor, from his landing at\r\nMilford Haven on Saturday the 6th of August until his triumphal entry into\r\nLondon on Saturday the 27th of the same month, is so minute that he must\r\nbe assumed to have had access to journals written at the time. Polydore’s\r\naccount of the sweat begins with the statement that it showed itself on\r\nthe first descent of Henry upon the island--_sub primum descensum in\r\ninsulam_[480]. The last continuator of the ancient chronicle of Croyland\r\nabbey, who was still making his entries when Bosworth Field was fought,\r\nnot far from Croyland, and who closed his annals the year after, records\r\nan incident which seems to show that the sweat had been prevalent before\r\nthe battle. Thomas, lord Stanley, lay at Atherstone, not far from\r\nBosworth, with five thousand men nominally in the service of Richard, and\r\nwas summoned by the king to bring up his force before the battle. He\r\nexcused himself, says the Croyland annalist, on the ground that he was\r\nsuffering from the sweating sickness[481]. I shall examine that evidence,\r\nand the general statement of Polydore Virgil, in a later part of this\r\nchapter. Meanwhile we may take it that the outbreak of the sweat was\r\nsomehow associated in popular rumour with the victorious expedition of\r\nHenry Tudor. Writers on the English sweat hitherto have had to depend on\r\nthe somewhat meagre and not always consistent statements of annalists for\r\ntheir knowledge of its first authentic occurrence. I am now able to adduce\r\nthe testimony of a manuscript treatise on the new epidemic, written by a\r\nphysician while it was still prevalent in London, and elaborately\r\ndedicated to Henry VII., if not composed by his order[482]. The author is\r\nThomas Forrestier, styled in the title a Doctor of Medicine and a native\r\nof Normandy, tarrying in London. Whatever his relation with the Tudor\r\ncourt may have been, his name does not occur in the patents as one of the\r\nking’s physicians. It appears, indeed, that he had got into trouble in\r\nLondon some two years after this date; for, on the 28th of January, 1488,\r\nthe king granted to him a general pardon, “with pardon for all escapes and\r\nevasions out of the Tower of London or elsewhere, and remissions of\r\nforfeiture of all lands and goods[483].” Probably he went back after this\r\nto his native Normandy: at all events, he is next heard of in practice at\r\nRouen, where he published, in 1490, a Latin treatise on the plague, one of\r\nthe first productions of the printing-press of that city.\r\n\r\nIt is in the opening sentences of his printed book on the plague[484], and\r\nnot in his manuscript on the sweat, that he fixes the date when the latter\r\nbegan. The sweating sickness, he says, first unfurled its banners in\r\nEngland in the city of London, on the 19th of September, 1485; and then\r\nfollow in the text certain astrological signs, representing the positions\r\nor conjunctions of heavenly bodies on that date. The London chronicles of\r\nthe time assign dates for the beginning of the epidemic which differ\r\nsomewhat from Dr Forrestier’s. One of them, a manuscript of the Cotton\r\ncollection, by an anonymous citizen of London, records the entry of Henry\r\nVII. into the capital on the 27th of August, and proceeds: “And the XXVII\r\nday of September began the sweating syknes in London, whereof died Thomas\r\nHyll that yer mayor, for whom was chosen sir William Stokker, knyght,\r\nwhich died within V days after of the same disease. Then for him was\r\nchosen John Warde.... And this yere died of that sickness, besides ii\r\nmayors above rehersed, John Stokker, Thomas Breten, Richard Pawson, Thomas\r\nNorland, aldermen, and many worshipful commoners[485].” In the better\r\nknown but not always equally full chronicle of Fabyan, who was then a\r\ncitizen, and afterwards sheriff and alderman, the date of Henry’s\r\nreception by the mayor and citizens at Hornsey Park is given as the 28th\r\nof August, the reference to the sweat being as follows: “And upon the XI\r\nday of Octobre next following, than beynge the swetynge sykeness of newe\r\nbegun, dyed the same Thomas Hylle, mayor, and for him was chosen sir\r\nWilliam Stokker, knyght and draper, which dyed also of the sayd sickness\r\nshortly after.” The only other particular date extant for the sweat of\r\n1485 comes from the country: Lambert Fossedike, abbot of Croyland, died\r\nthere of the sweating sickness, after an illness of eighteen hours, on the\r\n14th of October[486].\r\n\r\nApart from the hitherto unknown manuscript of Forrestier, these are the\r\nonly contemporary references. Stow, who must have had access to some\r\njournal of the time, says that the king entered London on the 27th August\r\nand that “the sweating began the 21st September, and continued till the\r\nend of October, of the which a wonderful number died,” including the two\r\nmayors and four other aldermen, as above. Hall’s chronicle, which has been\r\nthe principal source used by Hecker and others, reproduces the account of\r\nthe sweat by Polydore Virgil almost word for word; and Polydore’s account\r\nwas certainly not begun until after 1504 and was not published until 1531.\r\nBernard André, historiographer and poet laureate of Henry VII., was\r\npresent at the entry into London on the 27th August; but he gives no\r\nparticulars of the sweat of that autumn, in his ‘Life of Henry VII.,’\r\nalthough it is probable that his ‘Annals of Henry VII.’ would have\r\nfurnished some information had they not been lost for the year 1485, as it\r\nis to his extant annals for the year 1508 that we owe almost all that is\r\nknown of the second epidemic of the sweat in that year. The state papers\r\nof the time do not contain a single reference to the epidemic, although it\r\nwas so active in the city of London as to carry off two mayors and four\r\naldermen within a few days, and was besides, as Polydore Virgil says, “a\r\nnew kind of disease, from which no former age had suffered, as all agree.”\r\nLondon was full of people, including some who had stood by Henry Tudor in\r\nFrance, others who had joined his standard in Wales, and still others who\r\ncame to do homage to the new dynasty; and there is evidence remaining of\r\nhundreds of suitors, great and small, attending the court to receive the\r\nreward of their services in patents and grants, as well as evidence in the\r\nwardrobe accounts of the bustle of preparing for the Coronation on the\r\n30th of October. But in all the extant state records of those busy weeks,\r\nthere is not a scrap of writing to show that such a thing as a pestilence\r\nwas raging within the narrow bounds of the city and under the walls of the\r\nroyal palace in the Tower. It remains, therefore, to make what we can out\r\nof the medical essay which Dr Forrestier wrote for the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn his later reference of 1490, he says that more than fifteen thousand\r\nwere cut off in sudden death, as if by the visitation of God, many dying\r\nwhile walking in the streets, without warning and without being confessed.\r\nThat number of the dead need not be taken as at all exact: nor does it\r\nappear whether it is meant for London or for the whole country. But the\r\ndramatic suddenness of the attack is illustrated by particular cases in\r\nhis original treatise of 1485, although deaths so sudden are unheard of in\r\nany infection:--\r\n\r\n    “We saw two prestys standing togeder and speaking togeder, and we saw\r\n    both of them dye sodenly. Also in die--proximi we se the wyf of a\r\n    taylour taken and sodenly dyed. Another yonge man walking by the\r\n    street fell down sodenly. Also another gentylman ryding out of the\r\n    cyte [date given] dyed. Also many others the which were long to\r\n    rehearse we have known that have dyed sodenly.” Gentlemen and\r\n    gentlewomen, priests, righteous men, merchants, rich and poor, were\r\n    among the victims of this sudden death. Of the symptoms he says: “And\r\n    this sickness cometh with a grete swetyng and stynkyng, with rednesse\r\n    of the face and of all the body, and a contynual thurst, with a grete\r\n    hete and hedache because of the fumes and venoms.” He mentions also\r\n    “pricking the brains,” and that “some appear red and yellow, as we\r\n    have seen many, and in two grete ladies that we saw, the which were\r\n    sick in all their bodies and they felt grete pricking in their bodies.\r\n    And some had black spots, as it appeared in our frere (?) Alban, a\r\n    noble leech on whose soul God have mercy!”\r\n\r\nBoth in his pathology and in his copious appendix of formulae he directs\r\nattention to the heart, as the organ that was suddenly overpowered by the\r\npestilential venoms. Many died, he would have us believe, because they\r\nlistened to the false leeches, who professed to know the disease and to\r\nhave treated it before. A considerable part of his space is occupied with\r\nthe denunciation of these irregular practitioners, their greed and their\r\nignorance,--a theme which is a common one in the prefaces of Elizabethan\r\nmedical works also. It appears that the false leeches wrote and put\r\nletters upon gates and church doors, or upon poles, promising to help the\r\npeople in their sickness. They were also injudicious in the choice of\r\ntheir remedies--some ordaining powders and medicines that are hot until\r\nthe thirtieth degree and over, others ale or wine, or hot spices, “and\r\nmany other medicines they have, the which, the best of them, is nothing\r\nworth.” These false leeches knew not the causes,--their complexions, their\r\nages, the regions, the times of the year, the climate,--evidently the\r\nastrological lore which gave Chaucer’s physician, a century earlier, his\r\nacademical standing or his superiority to the vulgar quacks of his day.\r\nThose who fell into the hands of quacks, Forrestier implies, had an\r\nindifferent chance. Many died for want of help and good guiding; whereas\r\nmany a one was healed that had received a medicine in due order, “and if\r\nhe purge himself before.” The clearly written and fully detailed formulae\r\nat the end of his essay are so far evidence that Forrestier did not\r\ntraffic in secret remedies. The first part of the essay is occupied with\r\nthe doctrine of causes--the nigh causes and the far. The far causes were\r\nastrological; but the nigh causes, although they are altogether inadequate\r\nto account for sweating sickness as a special type, and are indeed little\r\nelse than the stock list of nuisances quoted in earlier treatises upon the\r\nplague, are suggestive enough of the condition of London streets and\r\nhouses at the time, and will be referred to in a later part of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe account of the treatment given by Polydore Virgil, and from him copied\r\ninto Hall’s chronicle, is probably the experience of later epidemics of\r\nthe sweat, although it comes into the history under the year 1485. The\r\nevil effects of throwing off the bed-clothes, and of drinking great\r\ndraughts of cold water, and, on the other hand, the benefits of lying\r\nstill with the hands and feet well covered, are among the topics discussed\r\nin letters during the epidemic of 1517, one of those which came within the\r\nhistorian’s own experience in England. But it is clear from Forrestier’s\r\nessay of 1485 that there were great differences in the regimen of patients\r\nin the sweat during its very first season, some adopting the hot and\r\ncordial treatment, others, perhaps, the cooling, just as in the smallpox\r\nlong after. Bernard André implies that there was a correct and an\r\nincorrect regimen also in the second epidemic of 1508, and there is\r\nevidence of conflicting advice in the letters on the sweats of 1517 and\r\n1528. If there were any better regimen in the later epidemics than in the\r\nearlier, as Polydore Virgil says there was, it was merely the wisdom of\r\navoiding extremes. Hence the misleading character of his remark that,\r\nafter an immense loss of life, “a remedy was found, ready to hand for\r\neveryone.” Bacon in his ‘Reign of Henry VII.’ took from Polydore almost\r\nword for word all that he says of the “remedy” of the sweat; and the\r\nunreal word-spinning thus begun was carried to its full development by\r\nbishop Sprat, the historian of the Royal Society (1667), who mistakes the\r\n“remedy” for some _arcanum_ or potent drug, gives my lord Verulam the\r\ncredit of preserving the prescription for the use of posterity, and\r\nadduces it as an encouragement to the Royal Society to seek among the\r\nsecrets of nature for an equally efficacious “antidote” to the plague.\r\n\r\nThe language of historians is that the sweat of 1485 spread over the whole\r\nkingdom. We hear of it definitely at Oxford[487] where it “lasted but a\r\nmonth or six weeks” and is said to have cut off many of the scholars\r\nbefore they could disperse. It is heard of also with equal definiteness at\r\nCroyland abbey. There is also mention of it in a contemporary calendar of\r\nthe mayor of Bristol, but without any special reference to that city[488].\r\nBeyond these notices, there appears to be nothing to show that the sweat\r\nwent all through England in the late autumn or early winter of 1485. But\r\nwe may take the following passage by Forrestier, in the dedication of his\r\ntract to the king, as expressing the state of matters, with perhaps some\r\nexaggeration:\r\n\r\n    “When that thy highness and thy great power is vexed and troubled with\r\n    divers sickness, and thy lordships and almost the middle part of thy\r\n    realm with the venomous fever of pestilence, and, by the reason of\r\n    that, young and old and of all manner of ages, with divers wailings\r\n    and sadness they are stricken: therefore, excellent and noble prince,\r\n    we are moved with every love and duty, and not for no lucre neither\r\n    covetyse, to ordain a short governing against this foresaid\r\n    fever[489].”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Sweat in 1508.\r\n\r\nAfter the first outburst of the sweat in 1485 had subsided, probably\r\nbefore winter was well begun, nothing more is heard of it for twenty-three\r\nyears. It reappeared in 1508, a third time in 1517, a fourth time in 1528,\r\nand for the last time in 1551. With each successive outbreak, our\r\ninformation becomes less meagre, while the epidemic of 1551 actually\r\ncalled forth an English printed book by Dr Caius, the epidemic of 1528\r\nhaving called forth a whole crop of foreign writings on its spreading to\r\nthe continent (for the first and only time) in the year following (1529).\r\nAs the nature, causes, and favouring circumstances of the sweat cannot\r\nprofitably be dealt with except on a review of its whole history, it will\r\nbe necessary to take up at once and together the four subsequent epidemics\r\nof it in this country, leaving the intercurrent and probably much more\r\ndisastrous epidemics of bubo-plague, during the same period, as well as\r\nthe great invasion of syphilis in 1494-6, to be chronicled apart.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the second outbreak of the sweat, in 1508[490], comes\r\nalmost exclusively from Bernard André, whose _Annals of Henry VII._[491]\r\nare fortunately preserved for that year (as they are also for 1504-5).\r\nUnder the date of July, 1508, he says that some of the household of the\r\nLord Treasurer were seized with the sweat, and died of it, “and everywhere\r\nin this city there die not a few.” In August public prayers were made at\r\nSt Paul’s on account of the plague of sweat. In the same month the king’s\r\nmovements from place to place in the country round London are described as\r\ndetermined by the prevalence of the sweat. From Hatfield, whither he had\r\ngone to visit his mother on the 9th August, he went to Wanstead, where\r\ncertain of his household “sweated;” on that account the king moved to\r\nBarking, and thence to other places about the 14th. He avoided Greenwich\r\nand Eltham, in both which places the chief personages of the royal palaces\r\n“had sweated,” so much did the sickness then rage in all places (_per\r\nomnia loca_). Some of the king’s personal attendants appear to have caught\r\nthe infection; nor did it avail, says André, to run away or to follow the\r\nchase, _quoniam mors omnia vincit_. Other visits were paid down to the\r\n17th August, and a strict edict was issued that no one from London was to\r\ncome near the court, nor anyone to repair to the city, under penalties\r\nspecified. The only one near the king’s person who died of it was lord\r\nGraystock, a young Cumberland noble. The Lord Privy Seal and the Lord\r\nChamberlain were both attacked but recovered; doctor Symeon, the dean of\r\nthe Chapel Royal, died of it. There appears to have been a good deal of\r\nthe sickness in various places, but many recovered, says André, with good\r\ntending. The king occupied himself with hunting the stag in the forests at\r\nStratford, Eltham and other places round London.\r\n\r\nFrom the provinces there is one item of information relating to\r\nChester[492]: in the summer of 1507, it is said, the sweating sickness\r\ndestroyed 91 in three days, of whom only four were women. At Oxford in\r\n1508, or the year before Henry VII.’s death, there was a sore pestilence\r\nwhich caused the dispersion of divers students; but it is not called the\r\nsweat[493].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Sweat in 1517.\r\n\r\nExcept for a single reference to the sweat in 1511, nothing is heard of it\r\nbetween the autumn of 1508 and the summer of 1517. The reference in 1511\r\noccurs in a letter of Erasmus, from Queens’ College, Cambridge, dated 25th\r\nAugust, in which he says that his health is still indifferent _a sudore\r\nillo_. This may possibly refer to the lingering effects of an attack in\r\n1508, or to the influenza of 1510; and as all the other references in 1511\r\nare to plague, and to alarms of plague, it may be doubted if the sweating\r\nsickness had really been prevalent in England in that year, or at any time\r\nbetween 1508 and 1517. We begin to hear of it definitely in the summer of\r\nthe latter year. We have now reached a period from which numerous letters,\r\ndespatches and other state papers have come down[494]. Among the most\r\nuseful of these for our purpose are the despatches of the Venetian\r\nambassador and the apostolic nuncio from London, the letters of Pace to\r\nWolsey when Henry VIII. was in the country and the cardinal not with him,\r\nthe letters of Erasmus, sir Thomas More and others.\r\n\r\nThe first that we hear of sickness in London in 1517 is from a letter of\r\nthe 24th June, written by a cardinal of Arragon to Wolsey, from Calais;\r\nthe cardinal, who was travelling like a noble, with a train of forty\r\nhorses, had intended to visit London, but was waiting on the other side\r\nowing to a rumour that the sickness was prevalent in London. It is\r\nprobable that this rumour had referred to the standing infection of\r\nEnglish towns in summer and autumn, the bubo-plague; for it is not until\r\nfive weeks later that we hear of the sweating sickness under its proper\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August the nuncio writes from London to the marquis of\r\nMantua that a disease is broken out here causing sudden death within six\r\nhours; it is called the sweating sickness; an immense number die of it. On\r\nthe 6th of August he occupies the greater part of a letter of three pages\r\nwith an account of it. To some it proved fatal in twelve hours, to others\r\nin six, and to others in four; it is an easy death. Most patients are\r\nseized when lying down, but some when on foot, and even a very few when\r\nriding out. The attack lasts about twenty-four hours, more or less. It is\r\nfatal to take, during the fit, any cold drink, or to allow a draught of\r\nair to reach the drenching skin; the covering should be rather more ample\r\nthan usual, but there was danger in heaping too many bed-clothes on the\r\npatient. A moderate fire should be kept up in the sick chamber; the arms\r\nshould be crossed on the patient’s breast, and great care should be taken\r\nthat no cold air reached the armpits[495]. The disease was on the\r\nincrease, and was already spreading over England; it was reported that\r\nmore than four hundred students had died of it at Oxford, which was a\r\nsmall place but for the university there. Burials were occurring on every\r\nside; there had been many deaths in the king’s household and in that of\r\ncardinal Wolsey, who was in the country “sweating.” Such is the universal\r\ndread of the disease that there are very few who do not fear for their\r\nlives, while some are so terrified that they suffer more from fear than\r\nothers do from the sweat itself.\r\n\r\nOn the same day (6th August), the Venetian ambassador, Sebastian\r\nGiustinian, who was on friendly terms with the nuncio and often indebted\r\nto him for information, writes to the Doge giving much the same account of\r\n“the new malady.” He remarks upon the sudden onset, the rapidity of the\r\nissue when it was to be fatal, and the cessation of the sweat within\r\ntwenty-four hours. His secretary had taken it, as well as many of his\r\ndomestics. Few strangers are dead, but an immense number of Englishmen. On\r\ngoing to visit Wolsey, he found that he had the sweat; many of the\r\ncardinal’s household had died of it, including some of his chief\r\nattendants; the bishop of Winchester also had taken it. On the 12th of\r\nAugust, the Venetian envoy writes that he himself and his son have had the\r\nsweat; Wolsey has had it three times in a few days, many of his people\r\nbeing dead of it, especially his gentlemen[496]. In London “omnes silent.”\r\n\r\nWolsey’s attack and relapses are confirmed by his own letter to the king;\r\nabout the end of August he went on a pilgrimage to Walsingham, and\r\nremained there most of September, but even after his return he was “vexed\r\nwith fever.” The relapses of the sweat, which are mentioned by Forrestier\r\nin 1485, by André in 1508, and now again in 1517, may have been the origin\r\nof the saying in the form of a proverb, which occurs in an essay of the\r\ntime by sir Thomas More,--that the relapse is worse than the original\r\ndisease[497].\r\n\r\nThe death of a well-known personage, Ammonio, the Latin secretary of the\r\nking, is the subject of several letters, including one of the 19th August\r\nfrom More to Erasmus; he died at nine on the morning of the 17th August,\r\nafter an illness of twenty hours: he had been congratulating himself on\r\nbeing safe by reason of his temperate life. More confirms the statement as\r\nto deaths in the university of Oxford, and he adds also at Cambridge. In\r\nLondon the sweat attacks whole families: “I assure you there is less\r\ndanger in the ranks of war than in this city.” His own family (? in\r\nBucklersbury) are safe so far, and he has composed his mind for any\r\neventuality. He hears that the sweat is now at Calais. On the 27th August,\r\nthe Venetian envoy writes again that the disease is now making great\r\nprogress; the king keeps out of the way at Windsor, with only three\r\nfavourite gentlemen and Dionysius Memo, who is described as his physician,\r\nbut in other letters as “the Reverend,” and as a musician from Venice. On\r\nthe 21st September the envoy has gone to the country to avoid “the plague\r\n_and_ the sweating sickness.” A few days later (26th Sept.) he writes that\r\n“the plague” is making some progress, and that the prolonged absence of\r\nthe king, the cardinal and other lords from London owing to the sweat, had\r\nencouraged the citizens to a turbulent mood against the foreign traders\r\nand residents; the state of matters was so threatening that three thousand\r\ncitizens were under arms to preserve the peace. The references after\r\nSeptember, 1517, are mostly to the “common infection” or plague, which was\r\nan almost annual autumnal event in London. There was probably some\r\nconfusion, at the time, between that infection and the sweat, not, of\r\ncourse as regards symptoms, but in common report; thus it is not clear\r\nwhether the fresh alarm in the king’s court at or near Windsor on the 15th\r\nOctober, owing to the deaths of young lord Grey de Wilton and a German\r\nattendant of the king, refers to the sweat or to the plague. As late as\r\nthe 2nd November, a letter from the University of Oxford to Wolsey\r\nexcuses delay in answering his two letters on the ground of the sweating\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of “sudor tabificus” at Oxford in 1517 is known from other\r\nsources as well: it is said to have caused “the dispersion and sweeping\r\naway of most, if not all, of the students[498];” and the nuncio, writing\r\nfrom London on the 6th of August, mentions the current but improbable\r\nstatement that more than four hundred students had died in less than a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nBesides these from Oxford, there are hardly any notices of the 1517 sweat\r\nin the country remote from London. A record at Chester mentions an\r\noutbreak of “plague,” which is taken to mean sweating sickness; it is said\r\nalso to have been “probably more serious than in 1507;” many died, others\r\nfled; and the grass grew a foot high at the Cross[499]. But these are the\r\nmarks of true plague, which we know to have broken out in London, and in\r\ncountry districts as well, in the autumn and winter of 1517, or almost as\r\nsoon as the short and sharp outburst of the sweat was past.\r\n\r\nAmong the references to prevailing diseases on the continent in 1517,\r\nbesides sir Thomas More’s rumour of the sweat in Calais, there is none\r\nwhich would lead us to suppose that the distinctive English malady had\r\ninvaded Europe in that year. But there is a significant statement by\r\nErasmus, hitherto overlooked, which almost certainly points to an epidemic\r\nof influenza on the other side of the North Sea the year after the sweat\r\nwas prevalent in England. It is known that there was a suddenly fatal form\r\nof throat disease prevalent in the Netherlands that spring, which has been\r\ntaken to be diphtheria; but the malady to which Erasmus refers can hardly\r\nhave been the same as that. Writing from Louvain to Barbieri on the 1st\r\nJune, 1518, he says that a new plague is raging in Germany, affecting\r\npeople with a cough, and pain in the head and stomach, he himself having\r\nsuffered from it. The significance of that epidemic, assuming it to have\r\nbeen influenza, will be dealt with in the sequel.\r\n\r\nBy means of the foregoing contemporary notices of the sweat in 1517 we\r\nare able to judge of the general accuracy of the summary of it in Hall’s\r\nchronicle, which has been hitherto almost the only source of information.\r\nThe sweat killed, he says, in three hours or two hours, which is something\r\nof an exaggeration of the shortest duration mentioned by the nuncio and\r\nthe Venetian envoy in their letters of the 1st and 6th August. Another\r\ngeneral statement may be suspected of even greater exaggeration: “For in\r\nsome one town half the people died, and in some other town the third part,\r\nthe sweat was so fervent and the infection so great.” The sweat lasted, he\r\nsays, to the middle of December. Stow, in his _Annals_, more correctly\r\nstates that the plague came in the end of the year, after the sweat. The\r\nplague was much the more deadly infection of the two; but even plague and\r\nsweat together, and at their worst, would hardly have destroyed one-half\r\nor one-third of the inhabitants of a town.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Sweat in 1528.\r\n\r\nAs the despatches of the nuncio and the Venetian envoy in London give the\r\nbest accounts of the sweat of 1517, it is in the despatches of the French\r\nambassador, Du Bellay, that we find the most serviceable particulars of\r\nthe sweat in 1528. Du Bellay, bishop of Bayonne, and a witty diplomatist,\r\nwas in London through the whole of it, and during that time sent letters\r\nto Paris, in three of which the sweat is a principal topic. From many\r\nother state letters of the time various particulars may be gathered, and\r\nin one letter by Brian Tuke, one of the king’s ministers, we find some\r\ntheorizings about the disease. The outbreak befell at the time when Henry\r\nVIII.’s passion for Mistress Anne Boleyn, sister to one of the ladies of\r\nthe Court, was waxing strong; it had the effect of parting the lovers for\r\nseveral weeks, the distance between them having been bridged over by an\r\ninterchange of tender notes, of which those of the king remain open to the\r\nprying eyes of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe sweat is heard of as early as the 5th of June, 1528, when Brian Tuke\r\nwrites to Tunstall, bishop of London, that he had fled to Stepney “for\r\nfear of the infection,” a servant being ill at his house. The sickness\r\nmust have made little talk for some ten days longer. On the 18th June, Du\r\nBellay writes that it had made its appearance “within these four\r\ndays[500].” On the 16th, the king at Greenwich was alarmed by the\r\nintelligence that a maid of Anne Boleyn’s had been attacked by it[501]. He\r\nleft in great haste for Waltham, and sent the young lady to her father’s\r\nin Kent. “As yet,” writes Du Bellay, “the love has not abated. I know not,\r\nif absence and the difficulties of Rome may effect anything.” The king\r\nwrote to her at once: “There came to me in the night the most afflicting\r\nnews possible.... I fear to suffer yet longer that absence which has\r\nalready given me so much pain.” He sends his second physician (Dr Butts)\r\nto her. The alarm about her health seems to have been uncalled for just\r\nthen, although both she and her father caught the disease within a few\r\ndays. By the 18th June, according to the French envoy, some 2000 had\r\ncaught the sickness in London. It is, he says, a most perilous disease:\r\n“one has a little pain in the head and heart; suddenly a sweat begins; and\r\na physician is useless, for whether you wrap yourself up much or little,\r\nin four hours, sometimes in two or three, you are despatched without\r\nlanguishing as in those troublesome fevers.” The day before, on going to\r\nswear the truce, he saw the people “as thick as flies rushing from the\r\nstreets or shops into their houses to take the sweat whenever they felt\r\nill.... In London, I assure you, the priests have a better time than the\r\ndoctors, except that the latter do not help to bury. If this thing goes\r\non, corn will soon be cheap. [The season was one of scarcity.] It is\r\ntwelve [eleven] years since there was such a visitation, when there died\r\n10,000 persons in ten or twelve days; but it was not so bad as this has\r\nbeen.” Writing again, twelve days after, on the 30th June, he says that\r\nsome 40,000 had been attacked in London, only 2000 of whom had died; “but\r\nif a man only put his hand out of bed during the twenty-four hours, it\r\nbecomes as stiff as a pane of glass”--that is to say, by keeping\r\nthemselves carefully covered, as we learn also from Polydore Virgil’s\r\nhistory and letters on the sweat of 1517, they greatly increased the\r\nchance of recovery. In his third despatch, 21st July, he says the danger\r\nbegins to diminish hereabout and to increase elsewhere; in Kent it is very\r\ngreat. Anne Boleyn and her father have sweated, but have got over it. The\r\nnotaries have had a fine time of it, nearly everyone having made his will,\r\nas those who took the disease in its fatal form “became quite foolish the\r\nmoment they fell ill.” His estimate of 100,000 wills is, of course, a\r\nhumorous exaggeration. The sweat had been at its height in London,\r\naccording to its wont, for only a few weeks, mostly in July. On the 21st\r\nof August one writes from London that “the plague at this day is well\r\nassuaged, and little or nothing heard thereof.” From other parts of\r\nEngland there are few particulars of the sweat of 1528. We hear of it at\r\nWoburn on the 26th June, in a nunnery at Wilton on the 18th July, at\r\nBeverley on the 22nd July--it is reported as very serious in Yorkshire\r\ngenerally,--at Cambridge on the 27th July, and at several places in Kent\r\nabout the same date. The “infection” at Dover as late as the 27th\r\nSeptember may not have been the sweat, but the ordinary bubo-plague. But\r\nit is probably to the sweat that the deaths of four priests and two\r\nlay-brothers at Axholme, in Lincolnshire, are to be referred, as well as\r\nthe heavy mortality in the Charterhouse, London[502].\r\n\r\nAs in the previous sweat of 1517, the letters of the time give us many\r\nglimpses of the invasion of great households in and around London,\r\nincluding the king’s.\r\n\r\nWhen the French ambassador was walking with Wolsey in his garden at York\r\nPlace (Whitehall) on a day in June, word was brought to the cardinal that\r\nfive or six of his household had taken the sweat, and the diplomatic\r\ninterview was brought to an abrupt end. Du Bellay writes again in July\r\nthat only four men in Wolsey’s great house remained well. Among those in\r\nhis household who died of it were a brother of lord Derby and a nephew of\r\nthe duke of Norfolk. The cardinal, who had suffered from the sweat and its\r\nrelapses in 1517, fled from it to Hampton Court on the 30th June, and shut\r\nhimself up there with only a few attendants, having previously adjourned\r\nthe law courts and stopped the assizes. On the 21st of July, Du Bellay\r\nwrites that it was almost impossible to get access to Wolsey, and suggests\r\nthat he might have to speak with him at Hampton Court through a trumpet.\r\nIn the same letter the French ambassador refers to the circumstances of\r\nhis own attack when he was visiting the archbishop of Canterbury (Warham),\r\nprobably at Lambeth: “The day I sweated at my lord of Canterbury’s, there\r\ndied eighteen persons in four hours, and hardly anyone escaped but myself,\r\nwho am not yet quite strong again.” The bishop of London, Tunstall, writes\r\nto Wolsey from Fulham on the 10th July, that thirteen of his servants were\r\nsick of the sweat at once on St Thomas’s day; he had caused the public\r\nprocessions and prayers to be made, which the king had wished for on the\r\n5th July. The governor of Calais writes on the 10th July: “The sweat has\r\narrived and has attacked many.” Only two were dead, a Lancashire gentleman\r\nand a fisherman; but in a second letter of the same night, four more are\r\ndead, of whom two “were in good health yestereven when they went to their\r\nbeds.” Various other letters about the same date make mention of personal\r\nexperiences of the sweat, or of domestics attacked, at country houses in\r\nthe home counties. The most minute accounts are those for the king’s\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th June the king had left Greenwich hurriedly for Waltham. In a\r\nletter to Anne Boleyn, he writes that, when he was at Waltham, two ushers,\r\ntwo valets-de-chambre, George Boleyn and Mr Treasurer (Fitzwilliam) fell\r\nill of the sweat, and are now quite well. “The doubt I had of your health\r\ntroubled me extremely, and I should scarcely have had any quiet without\r\nknowing the certainty; but since you have felt nothing, I hope it is with\r\nyou as with us.” He had removed to Hunsdon (on 20th or 21st June) “where\r\nwe are very well, without one sick person. I think if you would retire\r\nfrom Surrey, as we did, you would avoid all danger. Another thing may\r\ncomfort you: few women have this illness, and moreover none of our court,\r\nand few elsewhere, have died of it.” When Brian Tuke went to Hunsdon on\r\nthe 21st June, the king spoke to him “of the advantages of this house, and\r\nits wholesomeness at this time of sickness.” Two days after, Tuke having\r\nbusiness with the king, found him “in secret communication with his\r\nphysician, Mr Chambre, in a tower where he sometimes sups apart.” The king\r\nconversed with his minister about the latter’s ill-health (seemingly\r\nstone), and showed him remedies, “as any most cunning physician in England\r\ncould do.” As to the infection, the king spoke of how folk were taken, how\r\nlittle danger there was if good order be observed, how few were dead, how\r\nMistress Anne and my lord Rochford (her father) both have had it, what\r\njeopardy they have been in by the turning in of the sweat before the time,\r\nof the endeavours of Mr Butts who had been with them, and finally of their\r\nperfect recovery. The king sends advice to Wolsey to use “the pills of\r\nRhazes” once a week, and, if it come to it, to sweat moderately and to the\r\nfull time, without suffering it to run in. But the king’s optimist views\r\nof the malady were quickly disturbed. William Cary, married to Anne\r\nBoleyn’s sister, died of the sweat suddenly at Hunsdon, having just\r\narrived from Plashey, and two others of the Chamber, Poyntz and Compton,\r\ndied about the same time either there or at Hertford, whither the king\r\nremoved. On the evening of the 26th June there fell sick at Hertford, the\r\nmarquis and marchioness of Dorset, sir Thomas Cheyney, Croke, Norris and\r\nWallop. The king hastily left for Hatfield, on the 28th June, where still\r\nothers appear to have taken the sickness. Du Bellay, writing on the 30th,\r\nsays all but one of the Chamber have been attacked. From Hatfield the king\r\nwent at once to Tittenhanger, a country house which belonged to Wolsey as\r\nabbot of St Albans, and there he elected to take his chance of the sweat,\r\nkeeping up immense fires to destroy the infection. On the 7th July, Dr\r\nBell writes from Tittenhanger to Wolsey that “none have had the sweat here\r\nthese three days except Mr Butts.” Two days later, however, the\r\nmarchioness of Exeter “sweated,” and the king ordered all who were of the\r\nmarquis’s company to depart, he himself removing as far as Ampthill,\r\nwhence he thought of removing on the 22nd July to Grafton, but was\r\nprevented by the prevalence of the infection there. Shortly after Anne\r\nBoleyn returned to the court. It is clearly to the period of her return\r\nthat an undated letter of hers to Wolsey belongs; after writing a few\r\nformal lines to make interest with the cardinal, she took her letter to\r\nthe king for him to add a postscript, which was as follows: “Both of us\r\ndesire to see you, and are glad to hear you have escaped the plague so\r\nwell, trusting the fury of it is abated, especially with those that keep\r\ngood diet as I trust you do.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the attacks mentioned in the correspondence of the time are many,\r\nthe deaths are few. A letter of Brian Tuke’s to Wolsey’s secretary, on the\r\n14th July, takes a somewhat sceptical line about the whole matter. His\r\nwife has “passed the sweat,” but is very weak, and is broken out at the\r\nmouth and other places. He himself “puts away the sweat” from himself\r\nnightly (directly against the king’s advice to him), though other people\r\nthink they would kill themselves thereby. He had done that during the last\r\nsweat and this, feeling sure that, as long as he is not first sick, the\r\nsweat is rather provoked by disposition of the time, and by keeping men\r\nclose, than by any infection, although the infection was a reality.\r\nThousands have it from fear, who need not else sweat, especially if they\r\nobserve good diet. He believes that it proceeds much of men’s opinion. It\r\nhas been brought from London to other parts by report; for when a whole\r\nman comes from London and talks of the sweat, the same night all the town\r\nis full of it, and thus it spreads as the fame runs. Children, again,\r\nlacking this opinion, have it not, unless their mothers kill them by\r\nkeeping them too hot if they sweat a little. It does not go to Gravelines\r\nwhen it is at Calais, although people go from the one place to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Sweat on the Continent in 1529[503].\r\n\r\nWhether the sweat went at length to Gravelines or other places in that\r\ndirection does not appear; but there is abundant evidence that it showed\r\nitself in the course of the following year (1529) in many parts of the\r\nContinent, excepting France, and that its outbreak was often attended with\r\na heavy mortality. It was observed in Calais, as we have seen, on the 10th\r\nof July, 1528. But it is not until the year after, on the 25th of July,\r\n1529, that we hear of it again,--at Hamburg, where a thousand persons are\r\nsaid to have died of it within four or five weeks, most of them within\r\nnine days. On the 31st July it was at Lübeck, and about the same time at\r\nBremen and the neighbouring ancient town of Verden; on 14th August in\r\nMecklenburg; at Stettin on the 27th August, and at Wismar, Demmin,\r\nRostock, Stralsund, and Greifswald about the same date; in Danzig on the\r\n1st September; Königsberg, on the 8th; and so eastwards to Livonia in\r\n1530, and to Lithuania, Poland and Russia, the information for which\r\ncountries is vague. Copenhagen also suffered from it, and towns in the\r\ninterior of East Prussia, such as Thorn and Kulm. Meanwhile the sweat had\r\nproceeded by way of Hanover and Göttingen, about the middle of August\r\nafflicting also Brunswick, Lüneburg, Waldeck, Hadeln, Einbeck, Westphalia,\r\nthe valley of the Weser, and East Friesland. It reached Frankfurt on the\r\n11th September, Worms shortly after, and Marburg at the end of the month,\r\nbreaking up the conference there between Luther and Zwingli, and their\r\nrespective adherents, on the doctrine of the Eucharist. Jülich, Liege and\r\nCologne were reached about the middle of September, and Speyer about the\r\n24th, Augsburg (where there was a most severe and protracted epidemic) on\r\nthe 6th, Strasburg on the 24th. Freiburg in Breisgau, Mühlhausen and\r\nGebweiler in Alsace, in October. In November, the sickness overran\r\nWurtemberg, Baden, the Upper Rhine, the Palatinate, and the shores of the\r\nLake of Constance. Among the other German provinces visited in due order\r\nwere Franconia, Thuringia, Saxony, the Saxon Metal Mountains, Meissen,\r\nMannsfeld, Halberstadt, Magdeburg, Wittenberg, Lusatia, the Mark of\r\nBrandenburg, and Silesia. In Vienna the sweat prevailed during the siege\r\nby Sultan Soliman from the 22nd September to the 14th October. At Berne it\r\nis heard of in December, and at Basle in January 1530. The Low Countries\r\nhad not been affected so soon as their nearness to England might have led\r\none to expect: the sickness is said to have approached them from the Rhine\r\nin the latter half of September. They suffered severely, one of the\r\nheaviest mortalities being reported for the town of Zierikzee, where three\r\nthousand are said to have died subsequent to the 3rd of October, 1529.\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable progress over the mainland of Europe, France was\r\nconspicuously avoided. The sweat does not appear to have entered Spain,\r\nnor to have crossed the Alps. But all the rest of the Continent, from the\r\nRhine to the Oder (if not farther east) and from the Baltic to the Alps,\r\nwas reached by the English sweat in much the same way as if it had been an\r\ninfluenza reversing the order of its usual direction. There need be no\r\nhesitation as to the correctness of the diagnosis; the disease was\r\ndescribed by several foreign writers from their own observation, and their\r\ndescriptions agree entirely with those of Forrestier, in 1485, of Polydore\r\nVirgil, perhaps for the epidemics of 1508 and 1517, and of the\r\nletter-writers who were describing the epidemic of the year before (1528),\r\nas they saw it in and around London. The striking thing in the accounts\r\nfrom the continent is the enormous range of its fatality; in some towns\r\nthe proportion of deaths to cases was hardly more than in influenza, while\r\nin others it was the death-rate of a peculiarly pestilential or malignant\r\ntyphus; and those differences cannot have depended wholly upon the method\r\nof treatment.\r\n\r\nThese full accounts of the English sweat on the continent of Europe in\r\n1529 are in striking contrast to the meagre records of it at home. They\r\nwere compiled first in 1805 from the numerous contemporary chronicles, and\r\nprinted pamphlets or fly-sheets on the sweat, by Gruner, professor at\r\nJena, in his _Itinerary of the English Sweat_, and his _Extant writers on\r\nthe English Sweat_, published in Latin[504]. In 1834 Hecker went over the\r\nground again in his well-known essay, improving somewhat upon the positive\r\nerudition of Gruner, but at the same time hazarding a number of doubtful\r\ninterpretative statements, especially as to the sweat in England, for\r\nwhich the meagreness of the English records then available may be his\r\nexcuse. The erudition of Gruner, Hecker and Häser deserves every\r\nacknowledgement; but it is of value more especially for the extension of\r\nthe sweat to the continent of Europe in 1529, where it had abundant\r\nmaterials at its service, in chronicles, printed essays, and “regiments.”\r\nThere are extant no fewer than twenty-one printed essays or sheets of\r\ndirections on the English sweat, which were issued from the German,\r\nNetherlands, or Swiss presses between the month of October 1529 and the\r\nmonth of June 1531, two or three of them being in Latin and most of them\r\nbrief summaries in the native tongue for popular use. The corresponding\r\nepidemic in England did not call forth a single piece by any medical man,\r\nso far as is known. Nor does the English treatment appear to have lost\r\nanything thereby; for it was based upon the profitable experience of\r\nprevious epidemics as embodied in oral tradition. Down to the fifth\r\nepidemic in 1551, the only English writing on the sweat so far as is known\r\nwas the manuscript of 1485, by Forrestier. Almost all that we know of the\r\nepidemics in England in 1508, 1517 and 1528 comes from Bernard André’s\r\nannals and Polydore Virgil’s history, and from the despatches of the\r\napostolic nuncio, the Venetian ambassador and the French ambassador. The\r\nfifth and last outbreak, in 1551, called forth two native writings, one\r\nfor popular use in English in 1552, and another in Latin in 1555, both by\r\nDr Caius, physician to Henry VIII. and Edward VI.; these are indeed better\r\nthan nothing at all, but they are too much occupied with pedantry and\r\nlugubrious rhetoric to be of much service for historical purposes[505].\r\nThe information about the epidemic of 1551 is so scanty as to suggest that\r\nthe sickness in that year can hardly have been so severe as in 1528; the\r\nstate papers contain hardly anything relating to it, and we owe nearly all\r\nour knowledge of it to the diary of Machyn, a citizen of London, to Edward\r\nVI.’s diary, and to Dr Caius. Bills of mortality had been kept in London\r\nfor two or three weeks when the epidemic was at its height, from which\r\nsome totals of deaths are extant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Sweat in 1551.\r\n\r\nIt was not in London that the sweat of 1551 began, but at Shrewsbury--on\r\nthe 22nd of March, according to the manuscript chronicle of that\r\ntown[506], or on the 15th of April, according to Caius[507]. No record\r\nremains of its prevalence at Shrewsbury; the statement of Caius, that some\r\n900 deaths had occurred in a single city corresponds to the facts for\r\nLondon, and has no more reference to Shrewsbury (where Caius never\r\nresided) than it has to Norwich (as in Blomefield’s county history). The\r\nstrange influence in the air or soil advanced from Salop, as we learn from\r\nCaius, by way of Ludlow, Presteign, Westchester, Coventry and Oxford, in\r\nonly one of which places is anything known of it except Caius’s remark\r\nthat it proceeded “with great mortality.” The best record of its\r\nprevalence on the way from Shrewsbury to London occurs in the parish\r\nregister of Loughborough, in Leicestershire. Under the date of June, 1551,\r\nthe register has an entry that “the swat called New Acquaintance, alias\r\nStoupe! Knave and know thy Master, began on the 24th of this month.” Then\r\nfollow the names of 12 persons who were buried in four days, and, on the\r\nnext page, under the heading of “The Sweat or New Acquaintance,” the names\r\nof 7 more, all buried in three days--making a total of 19 in six days,\r\npresumably all dead of the sweat and presumably also the whole mortality\r\nfrom it in Loughborough, which had far heavier mortalities from the common\r\nplague in after years[508].\r\n\r\nThe date of its arrival at Oxford, on the way to London, is not known; but\r\na physician then resident there, Dr Ethredge, has left it on record that\r\nit attacked sixty in Oxford in one night, and next day more than a hundred\r\nin the villages around; very few died of it at Oxford, which showed that\r\nthe air of that university was more salubrious than at Cambridge, where\r\nthe two sons of the duchess of Suffolk died[509].\r\n\r\nThe sweat appeared suddenly in London about the beginning of July, and had\r\na short but active career of some three weeks. Deaths from it began to be\r\nmentioned on the 7th, and are entered in the king’s (Edward VI.’s) diary\r\nas having amounted on the 10th to the number of 120, in the London\r\ndistrict, including “one of my nobles and one of my chamberlains,” so that\r\n“I repaired to Hampton Court with only a small company.” The royal diarist\r\nsays that the victims fell into a delirium and died in that state[510]. On\r\nthe 18th July, the king, in Council at Hampton Court, issued an order to\r\nthe bishops, that they should “exhort the people to a diligent attendance\r\nat common prayer, and so avert the displeasure of Almighty God, having\r\nvisited the realm with the extreme plague of sudden death[511].”\r\n\r\nThe diary of a London citizen says that “there died in London many\r\nmerchants and great rich men and women, and young men and old, of the new\r\nsweat[512].” On the 12th died Sir Thomas Speke, one of the king’s\r\ncouncil, at his house in Chancery Lane; next day died Sir John Wallop “an\r\nold knight and gentle[513],” the same who had survived an attack of the\r\nsweat in 1528 when at Hertford with Henry VIII. It is not clear whether\r\nsome other deaths of notables in the same few days were due to the sweat.\r\nThree independent statements are extant of the mortality in London which\r\nhad all been taken, doubtless, from the bills regularly compiled. One\r\ngives the deaths “from all diseases” in London from the 8th to the 19th\r\nJuly as 872, “no more in all, and so the Chancellor is certified[514];”\r\nanother gives the deaths “by the sweating sickness” from the 7th to the\r\n20th July as 938[515]; and Caius gives the deaths from the 9th to the 16th\r\nJuly as 761, “besides those that died on the 7th and 8th days, of whom no\r\nregister was kept[516];” by the 30th of July, 142, more had died, by which\r\ntime it had practically ceased in London[517]. Caius adds that it next\r\nprevailed in the eastern and northern parts of England until the end of\r\nAugust, and ceased everywhere before the end of September. The king, in a\r\nletter of the 22nd August, written during his progress, says that the most\r\npart of England at that time was clear of any dangerous or infectious\r\nsickness[518]. Records at York make mention of a great plague in 1551, but\r\nwithout describing it as the sweat[519]. The event which excited most\r\nattention was the death by the sweat of the two sons of the widowed\r\nduchess of Suffolk, the young duke Henry and his brother lord Charles\r\nBrandon on the 16th of July. They had been taken from Cambridge, for fear\r\nof the sweat, to the bishop of Lincoln’s palace at Bugden, in\r\nHuntingdonshire, their mother accompanying them; they fell ill\r\nimmediately upon their arrival, the elder dying after an illness of five\r\nhours and his brother half an hour after him[520].\r\n\r\nBesides the cases of the two noble youths and others at Cambridge[521],\r\nthere are no particulars of its prevalence in “the eastern and northern\r\nparts of England” (Caius). But we hear of it in the register of a country\r\nparish in Devonshire, under the same name of “Stup-gallant” as in the\r\nLoughborough register; and it is probable that those two casual notices\r\nindicate its diffusion all over England in the manner of influenza. That\r\nconclusion may find some support in the statement of one Hancocke,\r\nminister of Poole, Dorset, that “God had plagued this realm most justly\r\nwith three notable plagues: (1) The Posting Sweat, that posted from town\r\nto town thorow England and was named ‘Stop-gallant,’ for it spared none.\r\nFor there were some dancing in the Court at nine o’clock that were dead at\r\neleven[522].” Its occurrence in Devonshire is proved by entries in the\r\nparish register of Uffculme: the whole burials in the year 1551 are 38;\r\nand of these no fewer than 27 occur in the first eleven days of August,\r\nand 16 of them in three days, the disease of which those persons died\r\nbeing named, in the register, “the hote sickness or stup-gallant[523].”\r\n\r\nComparing these records of the sweat of 1551 with those of the years 1517\r\nand 1528, we may conclude that the latest of those three outbreaks was not\r\nmore severe than the earlier, and that, in the Court circle, it was\r\nprobably milder. The gloomy rhetoric of Caius had led Hecker to construct\r\na picture of its disastrous progress along the valley of the Severn, in\r\nwhich there is not a single authentic detail. Caius says that he was a\r\nwitness of it, but that must have been in London; and the figures for\r\nLondon, although they indicate a very sharp epidemic while it lasted, do\r\nnot suggest a mortality greater at least than that of 1528. The Venetian\r\nambassador in writing a general memoir on England four years after, says\r\nthat all business was suspended in London, the shops closed and nothing\r\nattended to but the preservation of life; but as he makes a gross\r\nexaggeration in stating the deaths in London at 5000 “during the three\r\nfirst days of its appearance,” we may take it that his impressions were\r\nvague or his recollections grown dim[524].\r\n\r\nWere it not for the isolated notices of the sweat in Leicestershire and\r\nDevonshire, we should hardly have been able to realize that country towns\r\nand villages had been visited by an epidemic which was appalling both by\r\nits suddenness and by its fatality while it lasted. The name of\r\n“Stop-gallant,” by which it is called in these parish registers, shows the\r\nsort of impression which it made; but so far as the mortality is\r\nconcerned, that was often equalled, if not exceeded, in after years by\r\nforms of epidemic fever which had nothing of the sweating type, although\r\nthey might also have been called “stop-gallant,” and indeed were so-called\r\nin France (_trousse-galante_).\r\n\r\nApart from the notices in parish registers, we have the generalities of Dr\r\nCaius, which amount to no more than a funereal essay, in the scholastic\r\nmanner, upon the theme of sudden death. It may be doubted whether Caius\r\nreally knew the facts about the disease in the country. The 27 deaths\r\nwithin a few days in a small Devonshire village and the 19 in six days in\r\na small Leicestershire town, are hardly to be reconciled with the\r\nstatement in his Latin treatise of 1555, that “women and serving folk, the\r\nplebeian and humble classes, even the middle class,” did not feel it, but\r\nthe “proceres” or upper classes did: they fled from it, he says, to\r\nBelgium, France, Ireland and Scotland. It was for these that he was\r\nchiefly concerned; and when he approaches his rhetorical task with the\r\nremark that “nothing is more difficult than to find suitable words for a\r\ngreat grief,” we may take it that he was thinking rather of such moving\r\ncases as that of the widowed duchess of Suffolk, who had lost her two sons\r\nin one day, than of wide-spread sickness and death throughout the homes of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nNothing more is heard of the sweat in England after the autumn of 1551, at\r\nleast not under that name. Francis Keene, an “astronomer,” prophesied in\r\nhis almanack for 1575, that the sweat would return, “wherein he erred not\r\nmuch,” says Cogan[525], “as there were many strange fevers and nervous\r\nsickness.” Some years before that, in 1558 (a year after influenza\r\nabroad), there prevailed in summer “divers strange and new sicknesses,”\r\namong which was a “sweating sickness,” so described by Dr John Jones, who\r\nhad it at Southampton. We are, indeed, approaching the period of frequent\r\nand widespread epidemics of fever and of influenza, in both which types of\r\ndisease sweating was occasionally a notable symptom, as in the influenza\r\nof 1580 abroad, in the fatal typhus of 1644 at Tiverton, in the widespread\r\nEnglish fevers of 1658, and in the London typhus as late as 1750. How\r\nthose other types of fever, due as if to a “corruption of the air,” are\r\nrelated generically to the English sweat is a question upon which\r\nsomething remains to be said before this chapter is concluded. But the\r\nhistory of the English sweat comes to a definite end with the epidemic of\r\n1551. Sweating sickness of the original sort was never again the _signum\r\npathognomicum_ of a whole epidemic of fever. The English Sweat became an\r\nextinct species, after a comparatively brief existence on the earth of\r\nsixty-six years. Its successors among the forms of pestilential disease\r\nmay have occasionally put forth the sweating character, as if in a sport\r\nof nature; but the most of the travelling, or posting, or universal\r\nfevers, and universal colds, are easily distinguished from the\r\nsweat--_nova febrium terris incubuit cohors_[526].\r\n\r\n\r\nAntecedents of the English Sweat.\r\n\r\nThe history of the English sweat presents to the student of epidemics much\r\nthat is paradoxical although not without parallel, and much that his\r\nresearch can never rescue from uncertainty. Where did this hitherto\r\nunheard of disease come from? Where was it in the intervals from 1485 to\r\n1508, from 1508 to 1517, from 1517 to 1528, and from 1528 to 1551? What\r\nbecame of it after 1551? Why did it fall mostly on the great houses,--on\r\nthe king’s court, on the luxurious establishments of prelates and nobles,\r\non the richer citizens, on the lusty and well fed, for the most part\r\nsparing the poor? Why did it avoid France when it overran the Continent in\r\n1529? No theory of the sweat can be held sufficient which does not afford\r\nsome kind of answer to each of those questions, and some harmonizing of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nThe history of Polydore Virgil is so well informed on all that relates to\r\nthe arrival in England of Henry VII. that we may accept as the common\r\nbelief of the time his two statements about the sweat, the first\r\nassociating it in some vague way with the descent of Henry upon Wales, and\r\nthe second pronouncing it a disease hitherto unheard of in England. Caius,\r\nwho wrote in 1552 and 1555, and can have had no other knowledge of the\r\nevents of 1485 than is open to a historical student of to-day, said that\r\nthe sweat “arose, so far as can be known, in the army of Henry VII., part\r\nof which he had lately brought together in France, and part of which had\r\njoined him in Wales.” Hecker, the modern reconstructer of the history\r\n(1834), has passed from the tradition of Polydore Virgil and of Caius,\r\nclean into the region of conjecture in assuming that the sweat had arisen\r\namong the French mercenaries on the voyage and on the march to Bosworth.\r\nOn the other hand, the one contemporary medical writer in 1485,\r\nForrestier, is explicit enough in his statement that the sweat “first\r\nunfurled its banners in England in the city of London, on the 19th of\r\nSeptember,” or some three weeks after Henry’s entry into the city. There\r\nis nowhere a hint that it was prevalent among the troops, whether French,\r\nWelsh or English, who won the battle of Bosworth on the 22nd of August,\r\nthe only pretext for asserting that it was prevalent in the neighbourhood\r\nbefore the battle being the gossip of the Croyland chronicle concerning\r\nlord Stanley’s excuse to Richard III. for not bringing up his men, which\r\ngossip probably arose soon after when the sweat became notorious. Croyland\r\nwas not very far from the camp of the Stanleys; and yet we know for\r\ncertain (with the help of the state papers) that the death of the abbot\r\nLambert Fossedike from the sweat happened there after an illness of\r\neighteen hours on the 14th October, some seven or eight weeks from the\r\ndate of Bosworth Field, and some three or four weeks after the outbreak of\r\nthe disease in London. The probabilities of the case are all in favour of\r\nForrestier’s view that the first of the sweat in 1485 was its appearance\r\nin London; and we shall accordingly take that as our point of departure.\r\n\r\nHenry covered the distance between Leicester and London in four days,\r\nhaving left the former, after a rest of two nights, on the Wednesday,\r\nslept at St Albans on the Friday, and entered London, very tired by his\r\njourney (says Bernard André), on Saturday evening, 27th August, three\r\nweeks to a day from his landing at Milford Haven. Whether his whole force\r\ntravelled from Leicester at the same pace, and entered the city with him,\r\ndoes not appear; but it can hardly be doubted that Henry’s following,\r\nFrench, Welsh and English, had found their way to London without loss of\r\ntime, to make personal suit for the grants and patents that began to be\r\nissued under the royal seal in immense numbers after the first or second\r\nweek in September. London must have been unusually full of people in the\r\nweeks before the Coronation on the 30th October. But the pestilence that\r\nbroke out was not the “common infection” or plague, which might\r\nintelligibly have been fanned into a flame by a great concourse of people.\r\nIt was the sweat,--a new disease, a stranger not only to England but to\r\nall the world. We shall understand the mysteriousness of the visitation\r\nand the inadequacy of all ordinary explanations, by taking Forrestier’s\r\naccount of the causes of it, drawn up in the year of its first occurrence.\r\n\r\nAlthough this earliest writer on the sweat recognized its distinctive type\r\nquite clearly, making no confusion between it and the plague, yet he\r\nreferred both diseases to the same set of causes; and in his section on\r\nthe causes of the sweat he merely reproduces the conventional list of\r\nnuisances which occurs in nearly all treatises on the plague before and\r\nafter his time. There was little variation from that list, as it is given\r\nin the last chapter from a plague-book of the 14th century, down even to\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth; thus it is reproduced almost word for word in\r\nBullein’s _Dialogue on the Fever Pestilence_ written in 1564 (the year\r\nafter a great plague), and it is so uniform in Elyot’s _Castle of Health_,\r\nin Phaer’s, and in all the other hygienic manuals of the time, that it\r\nmight almost have been stereotyped. This was the causation which\r\nForrestier transferred bodily to the sweat in his manuscript of 1485;\r\nalmost the same causation had been given in the old essay of the bishop of\r\nAarhus on the plague, actually printed in London in 1480.\r\n\r\n    “The causes of this sickness,” he says, “be far and nigh. The far\r\n    causes--they be the signs or the planets, whose operation is not known\r\n    of leeches and of phisitions; but of astronomers they be known.... The\r\n    nigh causes be the stynkynge of the erthe as it is in many places....\r\n    For these be great causes of putrefaction: and this corrupteth the\r\n    air, and so our bodies are infect of that corrupt air.... And it\r\n    happeneth also, that specially where the air is changed into great\r\n    heat and moistness, they induceth putrefaction of humours, and namely\r\n    in the humours of the heart; and so cometh this pestilence, whose\r\n    coming is unknown, as to them that die sodenley, &c.”\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of the corruption he specially mentions the following,\r\nwhich probably had a real existence in the London of that time, although\r\nhe is merely reproducing a stock paragraph of foreign origin:\r\n\r\n    “And of stinking carrion cast into the water nigh to cities or\r\n    towns,--as the bellies of beasts and of fishes, and the corruption of\r\n    privies--of this the water is corrupt. And when as meat is boiled, and\r\n    drink made of the water, many sickness is gendered in man’s body; and\r\n    [so] also of the casting of stinking waters and many other foul things\r\n    in the streets, the air is corrupt; and of keeping of stinking matters\r\n    in houses or in latrines long time; and then, in the night, of those\r\n    things vapour is lift up into the air, the which doth infect the\r\n    substance of the air, by the which substance the air corrupts and\r\n    infects men to die suddenly, going by the streets or by the way. Of\r\n    the which thing let any man that loveth God and his neighbour amend.”\r\n\r\nHe then mentions a more distant source of corrupt air, apt to be carried\r\non the wind--the corruption of unburied bodies after a battle, which\r\nenters into all the plague-writings of the time.\r\n\r\nThese things were, of course, insufficient to account for the special type\r\nof the sweat, or for its sudden outbreak, for the first time in history,\r\nin September, 1485. There may have been such favouring conditions in\r\nLondon at the time; something of the kind is indeed implied in Henry\r\nVII.’s order against the nuisance of the shambles a few years after; but\r\nwe require a special factor, without which the unsavoury state of the\r\nstreets, lanes, yards, and ditches, or the crowded state of the houses,\r\nwould never have come to an issue in so remarkable an infection as the\r\nsweating sickness. Common nuisances were the less relevant to the sweat,\r\nfor the reason that it touched the well-to-do classes most, the classes\r\nwho suffered least from the “common infection,” or “the poor’s plague,”\r\nand were presumably best housed, or located amidst cleanest surroundings.\r\nEven within the narrow limits of Old London there were preferences of\r\nlocality. If the special incidence of the sweat upon the great households\r\nof prelates and nobles, and on the families of wealthy citizens, had\r\nrested only on the testimony of Dr Caius, who has a theory and a moral to\r\nwork out, there might have been some reason for the scepticism of\r\nHeberden, who questions whether Caius was not probably in error in saying\r\nthat the sweat spared the poor and the wretched, because he knows of no\r\nparallel instance among infective diseases[527]. But the fact is\r\nabundantly illustrated in the details, already given, for each of the five\r\nEnglish epidemics; and it is confirmed for the continental invasion of\r\n1529, e.g. by Kock, a parish priest of Lübeck, who says that “the poor\r\npeople, and those living in cellars or garrets were free from the\r\nsickness,” and by Renner, of Bremen, who says that it “went most among the\r\nrich people[528].” It was, indeed, owing to its being an affliction\r\nchiefly of the upper classes that the sweat has been so much heard of. So\r\nfar as mere numbers went, all the five London epidemics together could not\r\nhave caused so great a mortality as the plague caused in a single year of\r\nHenry VII., namely the year 1500, or in a single year of Henry VIII., such\r\nas the year 1513. But these great mortalities from plague, amounting to\r\nperhaps a fifth part of the whole London population in a single season,\r\nfell mainly, although not of course exclusively, upon the poorer class.\r\nThe bubo-plague, domesticated on English soil from 1348 to 1666, was\r\nemphatically the “poor’s plague,” and, as such, it illustrated the usual\r\nlaw of infective disease, namely that it specially befell those who were\r\nthe worst housed, the worst fed, the hardest pressed in the struggle, and\r\nthe least able to find the means of escaping to the country when the\r\ninfection in the city gave warning of an outbreak on the approach of warm\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nBut _morbus pauperum_ is not the only principle of infective disease.\r\nThere are pestilent infections which do not come readily under the law of\r\npoor, uncleanly and negligent living, in any ordinary sense of the words;\r\nand there are some communicable diseases which directly contradict the\r\nprinciple that infection falls upon those who engender it by their mode of\r\nlife. Unwholesome conditions of living may be trusted to engender disease,\r\nbut it does not follow that the infection so engendered will fall upon\r\nthose who lead the unwholesome lives; sometimes it falls upon the class\r\nwho are farthest removed from them in social circumstances or domestic\r\nhabits, or who are widely separated from them in racial characters. This\r\nprinciple I believe to be not only a necessary complement to the more\r\nobvious rule, but to be itself one of wide application. It has been an\r\noriginal theme of my own in former writings, to which I take leave to\r\nrefer in a note[529]; and, I have now to try here whether it may not suit\r\nthe rather paradoxical and certainly mysterious circumstances of the\r\nsweating sickness on its first outbreak in the autumn of 1485.\r\n\r\nIf the insanitary state of London were insufficient to explain the\r\nengendering of the disease, the next thing is to look for a foreign\r\nsource. Suspicion falls at once upon the foreign mercenaries who landed\r\nwith Henry Tudor at Milford Haven on the 6th of August. Who were these\r\nmercenaries? Did they suffer from any contagious disease? Were they likely\r\nto have engendered the sweat? Can the infection be traced, in matter of\r\nfact, to them? In seeking an answer, it will be necessary to enter\r\nsomewhat fully into the history of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Richmond’s successful expedition in 1485 was his second\r\nattempt on the English crown. The first had been made in 1483, when the\r\nduke of Gloucester was hardly seated on the throne and the duke of\r\nBuckingham was in the field against him. Richmond’s army on that occasion\r\nhad been furnished by the duke of Brittany, and is roughly estimated at\r\n5000 men in 15 ships[530]; the expedition sailed from St Malo in October,\r\nencountered a storm in the Channel which scattered the fleet, and drove\r\nsome of the ships back to the harbours of Brittany and Normandy, so that\r\nRichmond, having reached the Dorset coast with only one or two ships, was\r\nunable to land in force. He returned to a Norman port, and nothing more is\r\nheard of his army of Bretons; during the next two years he appears to have\r\nbeen left with no other following than two or three English nobles, among\r\nthem the earl of Oxford, who afterwards led a division of his army at\r\nBosworth. After repeated solicitation, he obtained in 1485 a small\r\nbody-guard (_leve praesidium_) from the regents of Charles VIII. at Paris,\r\na few pieces of artillery, and money to help pay for the transport of 3000\r\nor 4000 men. With these resources he betook himself to Rouen in the summer\r\nof 1485 and began to fit out his expedition. It would appear that he found\r\nsome difficulty in making up his force to the intended full complement,\r\nand that he was urged by the impatience of his followers and the chance of\r\na fair wind to leave the Seine with what force he had on the 31st of July.\r\nHis force of Frenchmen, under his kinsman de Shandé (afterwards earl of\r\nBath), consisted of only 2000 men, crowded on board a few ships. It is a\r\nfair inference that the men had been recruited in and around Rouen; we\r\nare told, indeed, by Mezeray that Normandy was at that time infested by\r\nbands of _francs-archers_ who had been licensed by Louis XI., and that the\r\nministers of Charles VIII. gave them to Henry Tudor, to the number of\r\n3000, regarding the proposed expedition of the latter as a good\r\nopportunity of ridding the province of Normandy of a lawless and\r\ndisreputable soldiery[531].\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the mercenaries who landed at Milford Haven on the 6th\r\nof August, were at once marched through Wales to Shrewsbury and Lichfield,\r\nand took a principal part in the battle of Bosworth on the 22nd of August.\r\nThey were Normans, who had become so great a pest to their own province\r\nthat Charles VIII.’s ministers were induced to take up Henry Tudor’s cause\r\npartly with the intention of ridding French territory of them. Their\r\nquality is plainly indicated in the speech just before the battle by\r\nRichard III., which had been composed for Hall’s chronicle; only they were\r\nnot Bretons, as the speech makes out; they were Normans, recruited for the\r\nexpedition in Rouen and the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nI have given so much emphasis to the nationality of these mercenaries\r\nbecause the theory of the English sweat turns upon it[532]. More than two\r\ncenturies after Bosworth Field, about the year 1717, when the English\r\nsweat had been long forgotten, an almost identical type of disease began\r\nto show itself among the villages and towns of that very region of France,\r\nthe lower basin of the Seine, where the mercenaries of 1485 had been\r\nrecruited.\r\n\r\n\r\nA form of Sweat afterwards endemic in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe Picardy sweat, which was first noticed as a disease of the soil about\r\nthe year 1717, and has continued off and on down to recent years, was\r\nindigenous to the departments in the basin of the Seine, from the Pas de\r\nCalais to Calvados, with Rouen as a centre. Why that strange form of\r\nsickness should have sprung up there and continued, now in one town or\r\nvillage now in another, with few blank years for a century and a half, no\r\none can venture to say. It was not the English sweat in all its\r\ncircumstances; on the contrary it was only rarely epidemic over a large\r\npopulation or a large tract of country at once. It was ordinarily limited\r\nto one or two spots at a time, and in the individuals affected it ran a\r\nlonger course than the English sweat had done. But whenever it did become\r\nwidely prevalent it also became a short and sharp infection like the\r\nEnglish sweat, causing in some years a very considerable number of deaths.\r\nDistinctively the Picardy sweat was a somewhat mild sickness of a week or\r\nmore, seldom fatal, distinctively also of a single town or village, or\r\nsmall group of villages. It was not unknown in some other parts of France,\r\nsuch as the Vosges and Languedoc, in Bavaria and in Northern Italy; but in\r\nthese other localities it has been much more occasional or even rare. Its\r\ndistinctive habitat for a century and a half has been the lower basin of\r\nthe Seine; and there it has been so steady at one point or another from\r\nyear to year throughout the whole of that period that it may be said to be\r\na disease of the soil, indigenous or domesticated, and depending for its\r\nperiodic manifestations mostly upon vicissitudes of the seasons, as\r\naffecting probably the rise and fall of the ground-water. It has been more\r\na disease of the well-to-do bourgeois class than of the very poor, and it\r\nhas often shown a preference for the cleaner villages. It has been the\r\nsubject of a very large number of French writings from the year 1717 down\r\nalmost to the present date. Strange as this form of disease is, neither\r\nits circumstances nor its nosological characters are left in any doubt; it\r\nis at once mysterious and perfectly familiar[533].\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory of the English Sweat.\r\n\r\nI have been at some pains to show that Henry Tudor’s mercenaries were\r\nenlisted in and around Rouen, or, in other words, they came from that very\r\ndistrict of France in which the sweat, in a somewhat modified form, began\r\nto make its appearance as an endemic malady two hundred and thirty years\r\nafter. If the sweat had not become an endemic or standing disease there,\r\nas if native to the soil, or if it had become equally a disease of all\r\nother parts of Europe, as typhoid fever has, the coincidence would have\r\nbeen less striking, and might have been made to appear altogether\r\nirrelevant by the long interval of more than two centuries between the one\r\nevent and the other. If it were a mere coincidence, we should conclude\r\nthat the same causes which established in Normandy in the 18th century a\r\nsteady prevalence of a sweating sickness, not unlike the more familiar\r\nprevalence of typhoid, had been at work on English soil more than two\r\ncenturies earlier, not indeed to establish a form of sweating sickness\r\nsteadily prevalent from year to year in one place or another, like the\r\nplague, but to induce five sharp epidemic outbursts, within a period of\r\nsixty-six years, four of which outbursts began in London and extended\r\nprobably over the whole country, while one began in Shrewsbury, travelled\r\nby stages to London, and spread all over England. And, as we are ignorant\r\nof the things which determine the type of the endemic sweat of Normandy or\r\nPicardy down to the present day, we can neither deny nor affirm that there\r\nmay have been corresponding factors of disease at work in the England of\r\nHenry VII. By such a line of reasoning we are brought to a view of the\r\nEnglish sweat which precludes all farther inquiry and makes a permanent\r\nblank or maze in our knowledge. Let us try, however, whether the facts of\r\nthe case do not better fall in with the view that the English sweat had a\r\nreal relation to the seats of the Norman and Picardy sweat, even at a time\r\nwhen that sweat had not come into existence as a definite form of disease,\r\nand although the French provinces appear to have been spared the invasion\r\nof the epidemic when it overran the rest of Northern Europe in 1529.\r\n\r\nThe means of communication in 1485 was not wanting, namely the Norman\r\nsoldiery of Henry VII. The tradition of their quality is preserved in the\r\nspeech composed in Hall’s chronicle for Richard III. before the battle of\r\nBosworth, and versified somewhat closely by Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n  “A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and run-aways,\r\n   A scum of Bretagnes, and base lackey peasants:\r\n   ... Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again;\r\n   Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,\r\n   These famished beggars, weary of their lives.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing incredible in the supposition that these men had brought\r\na disease into London although they had not themselves presented the\r\nsymptoms of that disease. Such importations are not unknown; the mystery\r\nhanging over them does not make them the less real. A well-known instance\r\nis the St Kilda boat-cold, “the wonderful story,” as Boswell says, “that\r\nupon the approach of a stranger all the inhabitants catch cold,” a story\r\nwhich Mr Macaulay, the author of the _History of St Kilda_, had been\r\nadvised to leave out of his book. “Sir,” said Dr Johnson, “to leave things\r\nout of a book merely because people tell you they will not be believed, is\r\nmeanness: Macaulay acted with more magnanimity.” The St Kilda influenza\r\nhas been amply corroborated since then by parallel instances from the more\r\nremote islands of the Pacific, and by striking instances in veterinary\r\npathology. Among the latter may be quoted the instance which has been\r\nheard of in Shropshire, of “sheep which have been imported from vessels,\r\nalthough themselves in a healthy condition, if placed in the same fold\r\nwith others, frequently producing sickness in the flock[534].” But there\r\nis an instance on a vast scale from the United States, the instance of\r\nTexas cattle-fever, which has recurred so often, and has been so closely\r\nwatched on account of the disastrous loss which it causes, that there is\r\nno room left to doubt the reality of that mysterious form of contagion. I\r\nshall have to speak very shortly of the malignant fevers of the assizes,\r\nwhich spread from prisoners who were not known to be ill of fever; these\r\nincidents are historical from the year 1522, when an epidemic of the kind\r\narose among the court and grand jury at the gaol delivery in the Castle of\r\nCambridge. Lastly the history of yellow fever, as expounded in part in\r\nthis volume, is an instance of a long-enduring infection arising from the\r\ncircumstances of the African slave-trade, the negroes themselves having\r\nbeen racially exempt from the fever although they had been the source of\r\nthe virus.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases the sickness which ensued among the healthy from contact\r\nwith strangers had a more or less definite type; and that type in each\r\ncase must have been determined mainly by the antecedents of the strangers,\r\ntheir racial characters being reckoned among the antecedents as well as\r\ntheir special hardships and their personal habits. In the case of the\r\nsingular visitation of England in 1485, the strangers were a swarm of\r\ndisreputable free-booters from Normandy, natives of a soil which developed\r\nthe sweat as an indigenous malady in the long course of generations. If\r\nthey themselves had shown the symptoms of the sweat in 1485, one might\r\nhave said that the circumstances of their passage in crowded ships, of\r\ntheir exhausting march from Wales to Leicestershire, and thence to London,\r\nhad brought to the definite issue of a specific disease that which was\r\notherwise no more than a habit of body, a constitutional tendency, a\r\ndisease in the making. But there is no reason to suppose that they\r\nthemselves incurred the symptoms of the disease at all; it was contact\r\nwith them in England, particularly in London, that determined the peculiar\r\ntype of disease in others. Those others were of a different national\r\nstock, and for the most part of another manner of life; in their very\r\ndifferences lay their liability, according to well-known analogies. Of\r\ncourse there must have been something material, something more than\r\nabstract contact, to cause the sweat in certain Englishmen; and although\r\nwe cannot image the form of the virulent matter, we are safe to pronounce,\r\nin this hypothesis, that it must have come from the persons of the foreign\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Habitat of the Virus.\r\n\r\nWe may go even farther in the way of specific probability, and bring the\r\nvirus definitely to a habitat in the soil. The English sweat, like the\r\nPicardy sweat itself, had certain characters of a soil poison, like the\r\npoison of cholera, yellow fever and typhoid fever; only it was not endemic\r\nlike the two last, but periodic, as well as somewhat volatile in its\r\nmanner of travelling, like dengue, influenza, and others of the “posting”\r\nfevers of former times. This brings us to the singular history of the\r\nepidemics of sweat in England,--to the clear intervals of many years and\r\nthe sudden bursting forth anew. What became of the specific virus from\r\n1485 to 1508, to 1517 to 1528, to 1551, and after?\r\n\r\nA fresh importation in each of the epidemic years after 1485 is\r\nimprobable; certainly the circumstances of Henry VII.’s expedition never\r\noccurred again, and the traffic between England and her two French\r\npossessions of Calais and Guines had nothing in it at all analogous.\r\nEqually improbable is the continuance of the sweat in isolated or sporadic\r\ncases from year to year throughout the intervals between the epidemics;\r\nthe only facts that give any countenance to such a continuous succession\r\nare the occasionally mentioned “hot agues,” as in 1518, and, on a more\r\nextensive scale, in 1539. The seeds or germs of the infection which arose\r\nfirst in London in September, 1485, must have lain dormant in the city\r\nuntil some favouring conditions came round to call them into life. It is\r\nimpossible to figure such dormancy of the virus except on the hypothesis\r\nthat it was a soil-poison, having its habitat in the pores of the ground.\r\nThe periodic activity of all such poisons depends, as we can now say with\r\na good deal of certainty, upon the movements of the ground-water, which in\r\nturn depend on the wetness or dryness of seasons. The kind of weather\r\npreceding each of the epidemics of the English sweat has been remarked on\r\nby writers, but somewhat loosely or erroneously. The peculiarity of the\r\nyear of the second sweat, 1508, (not 1506 as in Hecker, nor 1507 as in\r\nother writers) was a “marvellous” forwardness of vegetation in the month\r\nof January, unusual heat from the end of May to the 13th of June, much\r\nprized rain on that date, on the 16th, and on the 3rd of July[535], the\r\nsweat being heard of first in the Lord Treasurer’s household in July. The\r\nthird year of the sweat, 1517, began with a great frost from the 12th\r\nJanuary, so that no boat could go from London to Westminster all the term\r\ntime[536], while men crossed with horse and cart from Westminster to\r\nLambeth[537]. This great frost would appear to have been without snow, the\r\nwhole season from September, 1516, to May, 1517, being chronicled as one\r\nof unusual drought, “for there fell no rain to be accounted,” so that “in\r\nsome places men were fain to drive their cattle three or four miles to\r\nwater.” The kind of weather following the break-up of the drought is not\r\nmentioned, but there is implied of course a certain amount of rain. It was\r\nabout the end of July or first of August, 1517, that the sweat began in\r\nLondon and the suburbs. The fourth, and perhaps the most severe sweat,\r\nthat of 1528, followed upon two wet seasons, with one spoiled harvest in\r\n1527 and bad prospects for that of 1528. The winter of 1526-27 had been\r\nunusually wet from November until the end of January; then dry weather set\r\nin until April; after which the rain began again and continued for eight\r\nweeks[538]. The harvest before that seems to have been a partial failure,\r\nfor early in 1527 corn began to run short in London, and for a week or\r\nmore there was acute general famine, so that the bread carts coming in\r\nfrom Stratford had to be guarded by the sheriffs and their men all the way\r\nfrom Mile End to their proper market. The high price of corn continued\r\ninto the summer of 1528. The weather of that summer is not specially\r\nrecorded for England; but we learn from a diplomatic letter dated, Paris,\r\nthe 4th of July, that much rain had fallen and destroyed the corn and\r\nvines, so that there were fears of universal decay and dearth through all\r\nFrance[539]. On the 5th July, Henry VIII. requests Wolsey to have general\r\nprocessions made through the realm “for good weather and for the plague,”\r\nthe sweat having already been raging for more than a month. The fifth and\r\nlast sweat, in 1551, also coincided with an unusually high price of corn,\r\nor, in other words, followed one or more bad harvests. In 1550 wheat was\r\nat 20 shillings the quarter; at Easter in 1551 the price in London was\r\n26_sh._ 8_d._; ten or twelve ship loads of rye and wheat from Holland and\r\nBrittany were sold under the mayor’s direction at a stated but very high\r\nprice. Meanwhile the sweat was advancing from Shrewsbury to London, where\r\nit broke out on the 7th July. The statements of Dr Caius about stinking\r\nmists carried from town to town are, like most of his statements, so\r\nobviously the product of his uncritical rhetoric that it becomes almost\r\nimpossible to trust his narrative for matters of fact. But we may go so\r\nfar as to assume that the first half of 1551 was a season of an unusually\r\nmoist atmosphere. At all events the fifth season of the sweat, and also\r\nthe fourth (1528), stand out in the annals as years of scarcity following\r\nbad harvests, which had probably failed owing to continuous wet weather.\r\n\r\nThere is not, on the surface, much uniformity in the weather preceding the\r\nepidemics of the sweat in 1508, 1517, 1528 and 1551. In the first of these\r\nthe winter was mild and the early summer excessively hot and dry; in the\r\nsecond the winter and spring were remarkable for drought, with several\r\nweeks of intense black frost in the middle period; in the remaining two\r\nthe antecedent appears to have been an excessive rainfall. But in all the\r\nfour we shall find that the law of the sub-soil water, as formulated by\r\nthe recent Munich school with reference to epidemic outbursts, was\r\nexemplified. According to that law, the dangerous products of fermentation\r\narise from the soil when the pores of the ground are either getting filled\r\nwith water after having been long filled with air, or are getting filled\r\nwith air after having been long filled with water. It is the range of\r\nfluctuation in the ground-water, either downwards or upwards, that\r\ndetermines the risk to health; and in two of the years of the sweat, 1508\r\nand 1517, we find that there had been a rise from a very low level of the\r\nwells, while in the other two, 1528 and 1551, the wells had begun to fall\r\nafter standing for a length of time at an unusually high level. If this\r\nreading of the somewhat imperfect data can be trusted, it is at one and\r\nthe same time an explanation of the outbreak of the sweat in the\r\nrespective seasons, and a confirmation of the hypothesis that the virus of\r\nthe sweat had its habitat in the ground. That hypothesis is, indeed,\r\nsupported by so great a convergence of probabilities, both for the English\r\nsweat and for the endemic sweat of France[540], that it may be used to\r\nexplain the seasonal incidence without laying the argument open to the\r\ncharge of running in a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nWhatever had been the kind of weather determining the successive outbreaks\r\nof the sweat, it is clear that the favouring circumstances were in general\r\nnot the same as those of the bubo-plague. The greater outbursts of plague,\r\nas we shall see, were in 1500, 1509, 1513, 1531, 1535, 1543, 1547, and\r\nother years not sweat-years. It is only in the autumn of 1517 that the\r\nplague overlaps somewhat on the sweat, and even then it becomes noticeable\r\nmostly in the winter following the decline of the sweat. The two poisons\r\nhad existed in English soil side by side, but had not come out at the same\r\nseasons; also the sweat had been mostly a disease of the greater houses,\r\nand the plague mostly of the poorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Extinction of the Sweat in England.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the sweat from England after 1551, or its failure to\r\ncome out again with the appropriate weather, is one of those phenomena of\r\nepidemic disease which might be made to appear less of a mystery by\r\nfinding several more in the like case. A history of all the extinct types\r\nof infective disease would probably bring to light some reason why they\r\nhad each and all died out. But an epidemic disease leaves no bones behind\r\nit in the strata; nor has the astonishing progress of science succeeded as\r\nyet in detecting palæozoic bacteria, although that discovery cannot be\r\ndelayed much longer. Meanwhile we have to make what we can of the ordinary\r\nrecords. In our own time, so to speak, the sweat became extinct in 1551,\r\nand the plague in 1666; perhaps someone before long may be able to say\r\nthat typhus died out (for a time) in Britain in such and such a year, and\r\nsmallpox (for good) in such and such another. The surprising thing is that\r\nan infection which came forth time after time should have one day been\r\nmissed as if it were dead. If the sweat had five seasons in England, why\r\nnot fifty? Perhaps its career was short because the circumstances of its\r\norigin were transient and, as it were, accidental. But it may have been\r\nalso subject to the only law of extinct disease-species which our scanty\r\nknowledge points to--the law of the succession, or superseding, or\r\nsupplanting of one epidemic type by another.\r\n\r\nOther forms of epidemic fever, in the same pestilential class as the\r\nsweat, were coming to the front in England as well as in other parts of\r\nEurope. Thus, in 1539, a summer of great heat and drought, “divers and\r\nmany honest persons died of the hot agues, and of a great laske through\r\nthe realm.” The hot agues were febrile influenzas, and the great laske was\r\ndysentery. Again, in the autumn of 1557, there died “many of the\r\nwealthiest men all England through by a strange fever,” according to one\r\nwriter[541], or, according to another[542], there prevailed “divers\r\nstrange and new sicknesses, taking men and women in their heads, as\r\nstrange agues and fevers, whereof many died.” Jones in his _Dyall of\r\nAgues_, describes his own attack near Southampton, in 1558, and calls it\r\nthe sweating sickness.\r\n\r\nThat epidemic corresponded to a great prevalence of “influenza” on the\r\ncontinent, which was probably as Protean or composite as the fevers in\r\nEngland. It would not be correct to say that these new fevers or\r\ninfluenzas, with more or less of a sweating type, were the sweat somewhat\r\nmodified. But they seem to have come in succession to the sweat, if not to\r\nhave taken its place, or supplanted it. The prevalent types of disease\r\nsomehow reflect the social condition of the population; they change with\r\nthe social state of the country or of a group of countries; they depend\r\nupon a great number of associated circumstances which it would be hard to\r\nenumerate exhaustively. As early as 1522 we have the gaol fever at\r\nCambridge, at a time when Henry VIII.’s attempts to repress crime were\r\ncome to the strange pass described in More’s _Utopia_. These things remain\r\nfor more systematic handling in another chapter; but in concluding the\r\ncareer of the sweat in England we may pass from it with the remark that it\r\ndid not cease until other forms of pestilential fever were ready to take\r\nits place. The same explanation remains to be given of the total\r\ndisappearance of plague from England after 1666: it was superseded by\r\npestilential contagious fever, a disease which was its congener, and had\r\nbeen establishing itself more and more steadily from year to year as the\r\nconditions of living in the towns were passing more and more from the\r\nmedieval type to the modern. Meanwhile we have to take up the thread of\r\nthe plague-history where we left it in the reign of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPLAGUE IN THE TUDOR PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the town council of York met on the 16th of August, 1485, to take\r\nmeasures on account of Henry Tudor’s landing in Wales, their first\r\nresolution was to despatch the sergeant to the mace to Richard III. at\r\nNottingham, with an offer of men (they promised 400 for his army at\r\nBosworth), and their second resolution was to send at once for all such\r\naldermen and others of the council as were sojourning without the city on\r\naccount of “the plague that reigneth[543].” These leading citizens of York\r\nhad gone into the country to avoid the infectious exhalations within the\r\nwalls in the summer heats; the plague that reigned in York was the old\r\nbubo-plague, which would show itself in a house here or there in any\r\nordinary season, and on special occasions would rise to the height of an\r\nepidemic, driving away all who could afford to remove from the pestilent\r\nair of the town to the comparatively wholesome country, and taking its\r\nvictims mostly among the poorer class who could not afford a “change of\r\nair.” In the three centuries following the Black Death, change of air\r\nmeant a good deal more than it means now. The infection of the air, or the\r\n“intemperies” of the air, at Westminster occasioned (along with other\r\nreasons) the prorogation or adjournment to country towns of many\r\nparliaments; the infection of the air in and around Fleet Street caused\r\nthe breaking up of many law terms; and the infection of the air in Oxford\r\ncolleges was so constant an interruption to the studies of the place in\r\nthe 15th century that Anthony Wood traces to that cause more than to any\r\nother the total decline of learning, the rudeness of manners and the\r\nprevalence of “several sorts of vice, which in time appeared so notorious\r\nthat it was consulted by great personages of annulling the University or\r\nelse translating it to another place[544].” From the old college\r\nregisters, chiefly that of his own college of Merton, he has counted some\r\nthirty pestilences at Oxford, great and small, during the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The reason why the Oxford annals of plague are so complete is\r\nthat each outbreak, even if only one or two deaths had occurred[545],\r\nmeant a dispersion of the scholars and tutors of one or more halls and\r\ncolleges, their removal in a body to some country house, alteration of the\r\ndates of terms, and postponement of the public Acts for degrees in the\r\nschools. Experience had taught the necessity of such prompt measures. Thus\r\nthe first sweat, that of 1485, came so suddenly that it killed many of the\r\nscholars before they could disperse, “albeit it lasted but a month or six\r\nweeks.” Hardly had the halls and colleges begun to fill again after the\r\ndispersion by the sweat of 1485, when “another pestilential disease,” that\r\nis to say, the bubo-plague itself, broke forth at the end of August, 1486,\r\nin Magdalen parish, and daily increased so much that the scholars were\r\nobliged to flee again. In 1491 there was another dispersion; and in 1493\r\nso severe an outbreak of plague from April to Midsummer that many were\r\nswept away, both cleric and laic: Magdalen College removed to Brackley in\r\nNorthamptonshire, Oriel to St Bartholomew’s hospital near Oxford, and\r\nMerton to Islip, “instead of Cuxham their usual place of retirement.” The\r\ndisastrous fifteenth century closes with a specially severe plague in\r\n1499-1500, in which perished “divers of this university accounted worthy\r\nin these times;” an accompanying scarcity of grain and consequent failure\r\nof scholarships or exhibitions led many students to betake themselves to\r\nmechanical occupations. In August, 1503, the plague broke out again in St\r\nAlban’s Hall; the principal with all but a few of the students went to\r\nIslip, where the pestilence overtook them (three weeks having been spent\r\nfirst in mirth and jollity), so that several died and were buried, some at\r\nIslip, others at Ellesfield and one at Noke; in October it broke out in\r\nMerton College and drove some of the fellows and bachelors to the lodge in\r\nStow Wood, others to Wotton near Cumner, where they remained until the\r\n17th December. These interruptions had been so frequent that of fifty-five\r\nhalls, only thirty-three were now inhabited, and they “but slenderly, as\r\nmay be seen in our registers.” The town of Oxford shared in the decline;\r\nstreets and lanes formerly populous were now desolate and forsaken. An\r\nepidemic in 1508, which may have been the second sweat, caused another\r\ndispersion; then the old bubo-plague again in 1510, 1511, 1512 and 1513,\r\nfilling up the interval until the summer of 1517, when a “sudor\r\ntabificus,” the third sweat, “dispersed and swept away most, if not all,\r\nof the students.” The bubo-plague followed in the winter and spring,\r\nespecially in St Mary Hall and Canterbury College. Meanwhile cardinal\r\nWolsey had founded Cardinal College (afterwards Christ Church), bringing\r\nto it an infusion of new learning from Cambridge and elsewhere; but in\r\n1525, “while this selected society was busy in preaching, reading,\r\ndisputing and performing their scholastic Acts, a vehement plague brake\r\nforth, which dispersed most of them, so that they returned not all the\r\nyear following or two years after,” and Cardinal College “thus settled,\r\nwas soon after left as ’twere desolate.” The same outbreak affected\r\nspecially the halls or colleges of St Alban, Jesus, St Edmund and\r\nQueen’s[546].\r\n\r\nOxford was not altogether singular in this experience of plague from year\r\nto year or at intervals of three or four years. What Sir Thomas More says\r\nof the cities of Utopia was true of the towns of England or of any\r\nmedieval country in Christendom: “As for their cities, whoso knoweth one\r\nof them, knoweth them all; they be all so like one to another, as far\r\nforth as the nature of the place permitteth.” The limitation as to the\r\nnature of the place is not without importance for the frequency and\r\nseverity of plague; the quantity of standing water around Oxford would\r\ncertainly appear to have made the epidemics there a more regular product\r\nof the soil[547]. But we hear of plague also on the soil of Cambridge,\r\nparticularly in 1511, when Erasmus was there: on the 28th November he\r\nwrites from Queens’ College to Ammonio in London: “Here is great solitude;\r\nmost are away for fear of the pestilence,” adding rather unkindly,\r\n“although there is also solitude when everyone is in residence.” It is\r\nfrom such chance references in letters of the time that we can infer the\r\nexistence of plague throughout England. These references become much more\r\nnumerous as the sixteenth century runs on, not perhaps because plague was\r\nmore frequent, but because all kinds of documents are better preserved.\r\nThe remarkable difference between the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII.\r\nin regard to the quantity of extant materials for the construction of\r\nhistory is as keenly felt by the student of epidemics as by the student of\r\nhigh politics. The local records of towns, London included, are still\r\nalmost valueless for our purpose: even the skilled antiquaries employed by\r\nthe Historical Manuscripts Commission have hitherto extracted nothing\r\nconcerning pre-Elizabethan epidemics from the archives of civic\r\ncouncil-chambers, and only a little from muniment-rooms such as that of\r\nCanterbury Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe few details that we possess, such as those for the plague at Hull from\r\n1472 to 1478, had been extracted from local records by the authors of town\r\nand county histories. Before the end of the sixteenth century the evidence\r\nof plague epidemic all over England, as well in provincial towns and in\r\nthe country as in London, becomes abundant. There may have been really a\r\ngreat increase, but it is much more probable that the increase is for the\r\nmost part only apparent. It is of some consequence to determine the\r\nprobability as exactly as possible; and I shall therefore examine with\r\nmore minuteness than would otherwise have been necessary the evidence as\r\nto the existence and amount of plague in London and elsewhere year after\r\nyear from the accession of the Tudor dynasty in 1485, using chiefly the\r\nCalendars of State Papers for my purpose. As in the case of the sweat, we\r\nhappen to hear of plague in London and elsewhere because the Court was\r\nkept away by it; the king’s secretaries are informed week after week of\r\nthe state of health in London, and foreign ambassadors, especially the\r\nVenetian envoys, have frequently occasion to mention the hindrance to\r\npublic business caused by the plague. But for these State papers the\r\nhistorian of epidemics would have little beyond an occasional parish\r\nregister to build upon. The medical profession in England were not\r\nconcerned to write or print anything thereon; while there are numerous\r\nforeign printed books on the plague (e.g. Forrestier’s at Rouen in 1490)\r\nthere is not one original English treatise until that of Skene of\r\nEdinburgh in 1568. That the physicians were well employed by those who\r\ncould engage their services, and that they did sustain the credit of their\r\nprofession by the liberal scale of their fees, we have every reason to\r\nbelieve; thus the Venetian envoy writes on 3rd June, 1535, that he had\r\nbeen ill, and that he had expended seven hundred ducats during his\r\nillness, “and for so many physicians,” so that he had only one ducat\r\nremaining. But these thriving practitioners did not write books like their\r\nbrethren abroad. One of their number, Linacre, who was also a prebendary\r\nof Westminster, busied himself with editions of certain writings of Galen.\r\nErasmus mentions him in a letter as one of the Oxford scholars in whose\r\nsociety he found pleasure; but there is in the _Praise of Folly_ a\r\nreference to a certain grammatical pedant whom Hecker identifies with\r\nLinacre. The other physicians and surgeons of the period whose names are\r\nknown, Butts, Chambre, Borde and the rest of the group in Holbein’s\r\npicture of Henry VIII. handing the surgeons their charter, have left\r\nnothing in print which illustrates the epidemic diseases of the time, and\r\nlittle of any kind of writing except some formulæ of medicines: Borde, who\r\nwas patronised by Cromwell, is known only as a humorist or satirist. Thus\r\nthe inquiry must proceed without any of those aids from the faculty which\r\nmake the history of epidemics on the Continent comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous prevalence of plague in England in the reign of\r\nEdward IV., culminating in the great epidemic of 1479 in London and\r\nelsewhere, we do not hear of the disease again in London until 1487, two\r\nyears after the first sweat; in that year, on the 14th April, a king’s\r\nwrit from Norwich postponed the business of the Common Pleas and King’s\r\nBench until Trinity term, on account of the pestilence in London,\r\nWestminster and neighbouring places[548]. The next reference is to the\r\ngreat epidemic of 1499-1500, in London and apparently also in the country.\r\nFabyan, who was then an alderman and likely to know, puts the deaths in\r\nLondon at twenty thousand[549]; Polydore Virgil says thirty thousand[550];\r\nand others say thirty thousand deaths from plague and other diseases\r\ntogether[551]. The smaller total is the more likely to be nearest the\r\nmark. There is reason to think that the population of London a generation\r\nlater was little over 60,000; and it will appear in the sequel that a\r\nfourth or a fifth part of the inhabitants was as much as the severest\r\nplagues cut off, although it is entirely credible that the Black Death\r\nitself had cut off one half.\r\n\r\nThe enormous mortality in 1499-1500 has left few traces in the records of\r\nthe City or of the State. Five great prelates died during the plague-year,\r\nsome of them certainly from it: Morton of Canterbury (a very old man),\r\nLangton of Winchester (before he could be transferred to Canterbury),\r\nRotheram of York, Alcock of Ely and Jane of Norwich[552]. Like some of the\r\nlater plagues in London it lasted through the winter. It was at Oxford in\r\nthe same years, and casual references in two of the Plumpton letters lead\r\none to infer that it may have been in remote parts of the country\r\nalso[553].\r\n\r\nThe infection was still active as late as October, 1501, at Gravesend, and\r\nit made some difference to the reception of the young princess Catharine\r\nof Arragon, who had come over for her marriage with Prince Arthur, and\r\nbecame famous in history as the wife of his brother Henry VIII. The\r\nfollowing are Henry VII.’s instructions, dated October, 1501:--\r\n\r\n    “My lord Steward shall shew or cause to be shewed to the said\r\n    Princess, that the King’s Grace, tenderly considering her great and\r\n    long pain and travel upon the sea, would full gladly that she landed\r\n    and lodged for the night at Gravesend; but forasmuch as the plague was\r\n    there of late, and that is not yet clean purged thereof, the King\r\n    would not that she should be put in any such adventure or danger, and\r\n    therefore his Grace hath commanded the bark to be prepared and arrayed\r\n    for her lodging[554].”\r\n\r\nIn 1503 there was plague at Oxford, as we have seen, and at Exeter, where\r\ntwo mayors died of it in quick succession, and two bailiffs[555]. The\r\ninfection was certainly in London in 1504 or 1505 (perhaps in both, and\r\npossibly at its low endemic level in the other years from 1501): for\r\nBernard André mentions casually that he had been absent from the City on\r\naccount of it[556].\r\n\r\nIn 1509, the first year of Henry VIII., there was a severe outbreak of\r\nplague in the garrison of Calais, as well as “great plague” in divers\r\nparts of England[557]. In 1511, Erasmus writes from Cambridge on 17th\r\nAugust, 5th October and 16th October, making reference to the plague in\r\nLondon; and on the 27th October, 8th November, and 28th November, Ammonio\r\nanswers him that the plague has not entirely disappeared, and again that\r\nit is abated, but a famine is feared, and lastly that the plague is\r\nentirely gone. On the 26th of July the Venetian ambassador had written\r\nthat the queen-widow (mother of Edward V.) had died of plague and that the\r\nking, Henry VIII., was anxious.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st November, 1512, Erasmus, on a visit to London, was so afraid of\r\nthe plague that he did not enter his own lodging, and missed a meeting\r\nwith Colet. The next year, 1513, was a severe plague-year according to\r\nmany testimonies. In the diary of the Venetian envoy from August to 3rd\r\nSeptember it is stated that deaths from plague are occurring constantly;\r\ntwo of his servants sickened on the 22nd August, but did not recognize the\r\ndisease; on the 25th they rose from bed, went to a tavern to drink a\r\ncertain beverage called “ale,” and died the same day: their bed, sheets\r\nand other effects were thrown into the sea (? Thames). On the 17th\r\nSeptember he writes to Venice that it is perilous to remain in London; the\r\ndeaths were said to be 200 in a day, there was no business doing, all the\r\nVenetian merchants in London had taken houses in the country; the plague\r\nis also in the English fleet. In October the deaths are reported by the\r\nenvoy at 300 to 400 a day; he has gone into the country. On the 6th\r\nNovember and 6th December he writes that plague was still doing much\r\ndamage. On the 3rd December the rumour of a great prevalence of plague in\r\nEngland had reached Rome. On the 28th November Erasmus writes from\r\nCambridge that he does not intend to come to London before Christmas on\r\naccount of plague and robbers; and on the 21st December he writes again:\r\n“I am shut up in the midst of pestilence and hemmed in with robbers.”\r\n\r\nOne year is very like another, but it will be desirable to continue the\r\nnarrative a little longer so as to remove any suspicion of constructing\r\nhistory beyond the facts. In February, 1514, Erasmus writes that he had\r\nbeen disgusted with London, deeming it unsafe to stay there owing to\r\nplague. In going in procession to St Paul’s on the 21st May the king\r\npreferred to be on horseback, for one reason “to avoid contact with the\r\ncrowd by reason of the plague;” he had lately recovered from some vaguely\r\nreported “fever” at Richmond. On the 1st July Convocation was adjourned on\r\naccount of the epidemic and the heat.\r\n\r\nNext year, 1515, Erasmus writes from London on the 20th April that he is\r\nin much trouble; the plague had broken out and it looked as if it would\r\nrage everywhere. On the 23rd April Wolsey sends advice to the earl of\r\nShrewsbury in the country (? Wingfield) to “get him into clean air and\r\ndivide his household,” owing to contagious plague among his servants; on\r\nthe 28th the earl received from London one pound of manus Christi,--the\r\nsame remedy that Henry VIII. sent to Wolsey for the sweat--with coral,\r\nand half-a-pound of powder preservative. On the same date “they begin to\r\ndie in London in divers places suddenly of fearful sickness.” One of the\r\nincidents of the plague of 1515 which has fixed the attention of\r\nchroniclers was the death of twenty-seven of the nuns in a convent at the\r\nMinories outside Aldgate[558]. Next year, on 14th May (1516), the sickness\r\nwas so extreme in Lord Shrewsbury’s house at Wingfield that he has put\r\naway all his horse-keepers and turned his horses out to grass. In London,\r\non the 21st May, the Venetian ambassador removed to Putney owing to a case\r\nof plague in his house, and he would not be allowed to see Wolsey until\r\nthe 30th June, when forty days would have passed since the plague in his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe next summer, 1517, was the season of the third sweat. It was hardly\r\nover when plague began in London in September. On the 21st the Venetian\r\nenvoy speaks of having had to avoid “the plague _and_ the sweating\r\nsickness;” on the 26th he writes that the plague is making some progress\r\nand he has left London to avoid it. On the 15th October the king was at\r\nWindsor “in fear of the great plague.” One writes on 25 Oct., “As far as I\r\ncan hear, there is no parish in London free[559].” On the 16th November\r\nthe envoy begs the seignory of Venice to send someone to replace him as he\r\nthinks it high time to escape from “sedition, sweat and plague.” On the\r\n3rd December the king and the cardinal were still absent from London on\r\naccount of the plague; on the 22nd their absence was causing general\r\ndiscontent, the plague being somewhat abated. It was not until March,\r\n1518, that the court approached London; on the 15th the Venetian envoy\r\nrode out to Richmond to see the king, and found him in some trouble, as\r\nthree of his pages had died “of the plague.” The court withdrew again to\r\nBerkshire, and on the 6th April it was decided by the king’s privy council\r\nat Abingdon that London was still infected and must be avoided, the queen\r\n(Catharine of Arragon) having declared the day before that she had perfect\r\nknowledge of the sickness being in London, and that she feared for the\r\nking, although she was no prophet. On the 7th April the report of four or\r\nfive deaths at Nottingham (“as appears by a bill enclosed”) was made the\r\nground of postponing a projected visit of the king to the north. The\r\nspring was unusually warm, which made the risk of sickness to be judged\r\ngreater. It is clear that public business was suffering by the prolonged\r\nabsence of the court from London, and that the existence of infection was\r\nbeing denied. On the 28th April Master More certified from Oxford to the\r\nking at Woodstock that three children were dead of the sickness, but none\r\nothers; he had accordingly charged the mayor and the commissary in the\r\nking’s name “that the inhabitants of those houses that be and shall be\r\ninfected, shall keep in, put out wispes and bear white rods, according as\r\nyour grace devised for Londoners;” this was approved by the king’s\r\ncouncil, and the question was discussed whether the fair in the Austin\r\nFriars of Oxford a fortnight later should not be prohibited, as the resort\r\nof people “may make Oxford as dangerous as London, next term” (the law\r\ncourts sat at Oxford in Trinity term). However, the interests of traders\r\nhad to be kept in view also. On 28th June, 1518, Pace writes from the\r\ncourt at Woodstock to Wolsey that “all are free from sickness here, but\r\nmany die of it within four or five miles, as Mr Controller is informed.”\r\nOn the 11th July he writes again from Woodstock that two persons are dead\r\nof the sickness, and more infected, one of them a servant to a yeoman of\r\nthe king’s guard; to-morrow the king and queen lodge at Ewelme, and stop\r\nnot by the way, as the place appointed for their lodging is infected. On\r\nthe 14th July he writes to Wolsey from Wallingford that the king moves\r\nto-morrow to Bisham “as it is time: for they do die in these parts in\r\nevery place, not only of the small pokkes and mezils, but also of the\r\ngreat sickness.” The uncertainty as to what these diseases may have been\r\nwill appear from the next letter, on the 18th July, from Sir Thomas More:\r\n“We have daily advertisements here, other of some sweating or the great\r\nsickness from places very near unto us; and as for surfeits and\r\ndrunkenness we have enough at home.” The king had also heard that one of\r\nmy lady Princess’s servants was sick of “a hot ague” at Enfield. On the\r\n22nd July, the Venetian ambassador writes from Lambeth asking to be\r\nrecalled: two of his servants had died of the plague, and he himself had\r\nthe sweating sickness twice in one week. The pope’s legate, Campeggio,\r\nmade a state entry into London about the first of August, but the king and\r\nWolsey were not there to receive him, ostensibly for fear of infection.\r\nThe king was now at Greenwich, and we hear no more of the fear of\r\ninfection for a time. In the end of March, 1519, deaths from plague\r\noccurred on board one of the Venetian galleys at Southampton. On the 4th\r\nAugust, 1520, the king (at Windsor) has heard that the great sickness is\r\nstill prevalent at Abingdon and other villages towards Woodstock, and has\r\nchanged his route (“gystes”) accordingly; on 8th August, sickness is\r\nreported at Woodstock. The same year some kind of sickness was very\r\ndisastrous in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1521 (2nd November), the sickness continues in London:\r\n“it is not much feared, though it is universal in every parish.” According\r\nto a vague entry in Hall’s chronicle the year 1522 was in like manner,\r\n“not without pestilence nor death,” which may refer to the gaol fever at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThus from 1511 to 1521 there is not a single year without some reference\r\nto the prevalence of plague, the autumn and winter of 1513 having been\r\nprobably the time of greatest mortality in London. After 1521 or 1522\r\nthere comes a break of four or five years in the plague-references, except\r\nfor a vague mention of plague followed by famine at Shrewsbury in\r\n1525[560]. They begin again in 1526 (from Guildford) and go on until 1532\r\nevery year much as in the former period, the year 1528 being mostly\r\noccupied with the fourth epidemic of the sweating sickness. On the 4th\r\nJune, 1529, the legate Campeggio writes from London: “Here we are still\r\nwearing our winter clothing, and use fires as if it were January: never\r\ndid I witness more inconstant weather. The plague begins to rage\r\nvigorously, and there is some fear of the sweating sickness.” On the 31st\r\nAugust the Venetian ambassador has a person sick of the plague in his\r\nhouse; on the 9th September he has gone to a village near London on\r\naccount of the plague. On the 18th September the French ambassador in\r\nLondon (Bishop Du Bellay) has plague in his household, and in spite of\r\nrepeated changes of lodging his principal servants are dead; he has been\r\nunable to refuse leave to the others to go home, and is now quite alone,\r\nbut the danger from the plague is much diminished.\r\n\r\nIn 1530 the plague is heard of as early as March 23, previous to which\r\ndate two of the Venetian ambassador’s servants had died of it; three more\r\nof them died afterwards, and the envoy was forbidden the Court for forty\r\ndays. Parliament was prorogued on April 26 to June 22, on account of the\r\nplague in London and the suburbs, and farther, for the same reason, until\r\nOctober 1. The king was at Greenwich, but even there was not beyond the\r\ninfection; in the Privy Purse book, there is an entry of £18. 8_s._ paid\r\n“to Rede, the marshall of the king’s hall for to dispose of the king’s\r\ncharge to such poor folk as were expelled the town of the Greenwiche in\r\nthe tyme of the plague.” Similar payments are entered on January 13, 1531,\r\nApril 10, April 26 and November 8[561].\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1531, the king was obliged to leave Greenwich on account\r\nof the plague, removing to Hampton Court (now a royal palace since\r\nWolsey’s fall). In London it had somewhat abated, but, according to a\r\nletter of the Venetian ambassador, had been up to 300 or 400 deaths in a\r\nweek. In mid-winter, the 15th of January, 1532, Parliament was prorogued\r\non account of the insalubrity of the air in London and Westminster. The\r\ninfection may be assumed to have gone on, according to the analogy of\r\nknown years, all through the spring and summer, rising to a greater height\r\nin the autumn. We next hear of it on the 18th September, 1532, when the\r\nVenetian envoy writes from London that the king’s journey to Gravesend and\r\nDover would be by water, “as there is much plague in those parts, and\r\nthere is no lack of it in London. Yesterday at the king’s court the master\r\nof the kitchen died of it, having waited on his majesty the day before.”\r\nOn the 24th September, “the plague increases daily in London and well nigh\r\nthroughout the country.”\r\n\r\nOn the 14th October, “the plague increases daily, and makes everybody\r\nuneasy.” On the same date the Privy Council write to the king, who had\r\ncrossed to Calais accompanied by Mr Secretary Cromwell, for a meeting with\r\nthe French king, that there is a rumour of the plague increasing,\r\nespecially at the Inns of Court. On the 18th October Hales, one of the\r\njustices, writes to Cromwell that “the plague of sickness is so sore here\r\nthat I never saw so thin a Michaelmas term.” On the 20th, Audeley the Lord\r\nChancellor writes that many die of the plague, the sergeants in Fleet\r\nStreet have left in consequence, the Inner Temple has broken commons, the\r\nlawyers being in great fear. “_The Council have commanded the mayor to\r\ncertify how many have died of the plague._” That is the first known\r\nreference to the London bills of mortality, and was probably the very\r\nfirst occasion of them[562]. By that time the plague had been active in\r\nLondon for more than a month, and had clearly begun to alarm the\r\nresidents. The result of the Privy Council’s order to the mayor of London\r\nwas a bill on or before the 21st October, showing that 99 persons had died\r\nof the plague in the city, and 27 from other causes, the number of deaths\r\nfrom other causes suggesting that this was the bill for a week. On the\r\n23rd the Secretary of State is informed that the sickness is fervent and\r\nmany die; those who are not citizens are much afeard. On the 25th Sir John\r\nAleyn has assurances for Cromwell (at Calais) from all parts of the\r\ncountry that the whole realm is quiet, but the plague has been more severe\r\nthan in London. Cromwell’s French gardener was alive and well on Saturday\r\nafternoon, the 12th, and he was dead of the plague and buried on Monday\r\nmorning the 14th. On the 27th the death “is quite abated” in London and\r\nWestminster, according to one; but according to the Lord Chancellor, on\r\nthe 28th, the plague increases, especially about Fleet Street. On the 31st\r\nOctober one writes, “I have not seen London so destitute of people as it\r\nwas when I came there.” On 2nd November the death is assuaged and there is\r\ngood rule kept, for Sir Hugh Vaughan takes pains in his office like an\r\nhonest gentleman. On the 9th November the plague is abated. There the\r\ncorrespondence ends, the Court having returned from France. But we may\r\nhere bring in a certain weekly bill of mortality which has come down among\r\nthe waifs of paper from that period[563]. It is for the week from the 16th\r\nto the 23rd of November, the year not being stated; the experts of the\r\nnational collection of manuscripts were at one time inclined to assign it\r\nto “circa 1512;” but the first that we hear of the mayor being called upon\r\nto furnish a bill of plague-deaths is the order by the lords of the\r\nCouncil on or about the 20th October 1532, the first bill having shown 99\r\ndeaths in the city from plague and 27 deaths (in the week) from other\r\ncauses. The extant bill for the week 16th to 23rd November is clearly one\r\nof a series; there are no good grounds for assigning it to an earlier date\r\nthan the year 1532, while there are reasons for not placing it later.\r\nThere are two other plague-bills extant, for August, 1535, written out in\r\na more clerkly fashion, and bearing the marks of greater experience. The\r\nbill for the week in November is more primitive in appearance; and we may\r\nfairly take it as one of the series first ordered by the Council in 1532:\r\nfor that was the most considerable year of the plague immediately\r\npreceding the outburst of 1535, to which the more finished bills certainly\r\nbelong. The week in November, for which it gives the deaths from plague\r\nand other causes in the city parishes is later than the dates of the 2nd\r\nand 9th, when the plague was “suaged” and “abated;” the bill therefore\r\nstands for plague on the decline, or near extinction for the season, its\r\ntotal of plague deaths being 33, and of other deaths 32, as against 99 and\r\n27 respectively in the corresponding week of October. As this, the\r\nearliest of a great historical series of London bills of mortality, has a\r\npeculiar interest, I transcribe it in full, retaining the original\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\n    Syns the XVIth day of November unto the XXIII day of the same moneth\r\n    ys dead within the cite and freedom yong and old these many folowyng\r\n    of the plage and other dyseases.\r\n\r\n        Inprimys benetts gracechurch i of the plage\r\n        S Buttolls in front of Bysshops gate i corse\r\n        S Nycholas flesshammls i of the plage\r\n        S Peturs in Cornhill i of the plage\r\n        Mary Woolnerth i corse\r\n        All Halowes Barkyng ii corses\r\n        Kateryn Colman i of the plage\r\n        Mary Aldermanbury i corse\r\n        Michaels in Cornhill iii one of the plage\r\n        All halows the Moor ii i of the plage\r\n        S Gyliz iiii corses iii of the plage\r\n        S Dunstons in the West iiii of the plage\r\n        Stevens in Colman Strete i corse\r\n        All halowys Lumbert Strete i corse\r\n        Martins Owut Whiche i corse\r\n        Margett Moyses i of the plage\r\n        Kateryn Creechurch ii of the plage\r\n        Martyns in the Vintre ii corses\r\n        Buttolls in front Algate iiii corses\r\n        S Olavs in Hart Strete ii corses\r\n        S Andros in Holborn ii of the plage\r\n        S Peters at Powls Wharff ii of the plage\r\n        S Fayths i corse of the plage\r\n        S Alphes i corse of the plage\r\n        S Mathows in Fryday Strete i of the plage\r\n        Aldermary ii corses\r\n        S Pulcres iii corses i of the plage\r\n        S Thomas Appostells ii of the plage\r\n        S Leonerds Foster Lane i of the plage\r\n        Michaels in the Ryall ii corses\r\n        S Albornes i corse of the plage\r\n        Swytthyns ii corses of the plage\r\n        Mary Somersette i corse\r\n        S Bryde v corses i of the plage\r\n        S Benetts Powls Wharff i of the plage\r\n        All halows in the Wall i of the plage\r\n        Mary Hyll i corse.\r\n\r\n        Sum of the plage xxxiiii persons\r\n        Sum of other seknes xxxii persons\r\n\r\n                    The holl sum xx/iii & vi.\r\n\r\n    And there is this weke clere xxx/iii and iii paryshes as by this bille\r\n    doth appere.\r\n\r\n        The exec{n} of corses buryed of the plage within the cite of\r\n        London syns &c.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to have been any occasion for a continuance of\r\nplague-bills beyond the date of the one just given until nearly three\r\nyears after: we hear, indeed, of a severe epidemic of plague at Oxford in\r\n1533, but nothing of it in London until 1535[564]. It so happens that a\r\npair of London bills of mortality is extant from the month of August in\r\nthat year. Thus, by a singular coincidence, the only original bills of\r\nmortality that have come down (so far as is known) from the sixteenth\r\ncentury, are one from the end of the series in the first year of their\r\nexecution (1532), and another the very first of the series in the second\r\nyear of their execution (1535), or in the series ordered on account of the\r\nepidemic of plague next following. Of that epidemic also it may be\r\npermitted to give somewhat full details, for it is only rarely that we\r\nhave the chance of realizing the facts in so concrete a way.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn of 1535 Henry VIII., with the queen (Anne\r\nBoleyn), was mostly at his manor of Thornbury in Gloucestershire, Cromwell\r\nthe principal Secretary of State being either with the king or in his\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. The absence of the Court occasions numerous\r\nletters to be sent from and to London, in which we hear of the plague\r\namong other things. Cromwell had four houses in or near London at this\r\ntime,--at the Rolls in Chancery Lane, at Austin Friars in the City, at the\r\nfashionable suburb of Stepney, and at Highbury: besides these he had a\r\nfine villa building at Hackney. From his steward or other servants at one\r\nor more of these he was in receipt of letters constantly during his\r\nabsence. A letter from the Rolls on the 30th July informs him that twelve\r\nheron-shaws had been sent to him from Kent, and had been received at the\r\nRolls “as the city of London is sorely infected with the plague.” Next day\r\nanother writes that the City is infected but Fleet Street is clean. On the\r\n5th August “the common sickness waxeth very busy in London.” On the 7th\r\nLord Chancellor Audeley writes from “my house at Christchurch”\r\n(Creechurch, near Aldgate) that he had been expecting Cromwell in London,\r\nbut hears that he will not return for nine or ten days; will therefore go\r\nto his house at Colchester meanwhile, as they are dying of the plague in\r\ndivers parishes in London. Cromwell was naturally desirous to know\r\naccurately the state of health in the city, so as to regulate his own\r\nmovements and perhaps the king’s also; he accordingly makes inquiries of\r\nhis various correspondents. Another letter from London on the 7th August\r\ninforms him that there is no death at Court, but only in certain places in\r\nthe city: “I fear these great humidities will engender pestilence at the\r\nend of the year, rather after Bartholomew tide than before. If you be near\r\nLondon you must avoid conference of people.” On receipt of this Cromwell\r\nwould appear to have written to the mayor of London, for on the 13th\r\nAugust his clerk at the Rolls replies to him that he had delivered the\r\nletter to the lord mayor. On the 16th another of the household at the\r\nRolls writes that the plague rages in every parish in London, but not so\r\nbad as in many places abroad: “I will send the number of the dead. The\r\nmayor keeps his chamber. Some say he is sick of an ague; others that he\r\nwas cut about the brows for the megrims, which vexeth him sore. Few men\r\ncome at him, but women.” The bill of mortality which Cromwell had asked\r\nfor previous to 13th August is extant[565]. It is in two parts: one\r\nshowing 31 deaths from plague and 31 deaths from other causes in\r\nthirty-seven out of one hundred parishes from the 5th to the 12th August,\r\nwith a list of parishes clear; and the other, headed “14th August” and\r\nprobably meant to include the former, showing a much heavier mortality and\r\na much shorter list of parishes clear, the whole being endorsed by the\r\nmayor, Sir John Champneys, as follows: “So appeareth there be dead within\r\nthe city of London of the plague and otherwise from the 6th day of this\r\nmonth of August to the 14th day, which be eight days complete, the full\r\nnumber of 152 persons [105 of them from plague]. And this day se’night\r\nyour mastership [Mr Secretary Cromwell] shall be certified of the number\r\nthat shall chance to depart in the meantime. Yours as I am bound, John\r\nChampeneys.” This double bill for certain days in August, 1535, is rather\r\nmore elaborate than, but otherwise not unlike, the above bill, for a week\r\nin November, most likely of the year 1532. It will be noticed that the\r\ndeaths in all the city parishes from other causes than plague are 47 in\r\nthe bill for eight (or nine) days; 31 in the bill, partly the same, for\r\nseven days, and 32 in the earlier bill for seven days, while they are\r\nknown to have been 27 in another bill of October, 1532, probably also for\r\nseven days. These figures, the best to be had, are important for\r\ncalculating the population of London at the time; they represent quite an\r\nordinary weekly mortality, the deaths from plague being found to be always\r\nextra deaths, where we can compare the mortality year after year, as in\r\nthe London bills of later times.\r\n\r\nThe weekly bills of mortality called for in the plague of 1535 were sent\r\nregularly to the Secretary of State until the end of September--on the\r\n22nd and 30th August, and on the 4th, (and 5th), 11th and 27th September.\r\nThe one sent on Monday the 30th August showed 157 deaths during the\r\npreceding week, of which 140 were put down to plague, leaving only 17\r\ndeaths in the week from ordinary causes,--a small number owing perhaps to\r\nso many residents having gone to the country. No figures remain from the\r\nother bills, but we know from letters that the plague increased\r\nconsiderably in September (e.g. 11th Sept. “By the Lord Mayor’s\r\ncertificate which I send you will see that the plague increases”) both in\r\nLondon and in the country, justifying the prediction that it would be\r\nworse after Bartholomew-tide; it is not until the 28th October that we\r\nhear of the deaths being “well stopped” in London. Some few particulars of\r\nthis epidemic, and of its revival in 1536, remain to be added before we\r\ncome to speak of the London bills of mortality in general, of the extent\r\nof the City and liberties at this period, of its sanitary condition, and\r\nof the public health from year to year.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th August, 1535, one writes to Cromwell from the Temple that the\r\nplague “has visited my house near Stepney where my wife lives.” On the\r\n20th August a resident in Lincoln’s Inn was seized with plague and\r\nconveyed thence by night to a poor man’s house right against the chamber\r\nof one of Cromwell’s household at the Rolls, where he died. “Such as\r\nlodge in your gate seldom go out, and will have less occasion if, before\r\ngreat time pass, you will appoint from Endevill, or elsewhere within your\r\nrule, some venison for the household, that men may be the better contented\r\nwith their fare.” On the same date Cromwell is informed by his steward at\r\nAustin Friars that “the Frenchman next your house that was in St Peter’s\r\nparish [Cornhill] has buried two, but no more.” The plague looked\r\nthreatening enough to raise the question whether Bartholomew fair should\r\nbe held at Smithfield this year. Meanwhile the king and court were at\r\nThornbury in Gloucestershire, having arrived there on the 18th August. The\r\ntown of Bristol was avoided “because the plague of pestilence then reigned\r\nwithin the said town;” but a deputation of three persons was sent to the\r\nking to present him with ten fat oxen and forty sheep, and to present the\r\nqueen, Anne Boleyn, with a gold cup full of gold pieces, an offering known\r\nas “queen gold[566].” On the 25th of August the French ambassador\r\nproceeded to Gloucestershire to inform Henry VIII. “of the interview of\r\nthe two queens,” but he stopped six miles short of the court, owing to a\r\n“French merchant” who followed him having died of plague on the road. On\r\nthe 4th September the plague in London is aggravated by a scarcity of\r\nbread; “what was sold for ½_d._ when you were here is now 1_d._,” and it\r\nis so musty that it is rather poisonous than nourishing. On the 6th the\r\nseason has been unfavourable and there is great probability of famine. On\r\nthe 13th the Lord Chancellor will stay at his house at Old Ford beside\r\nStratford, on account of the plague in London increasing; he will have to\r\ngo to Westminster on the 3rd November, with the Speaker and others, to\r\nprorogue Parliament, and advises the prorogation to be until the 4th of\r\nFebruary, and of the law courts until the eve of All Souls, by which time,\r\nby coldness of the weather, the plague should cease. Wheat and rye were at\r\na mark and 16/- the quarter. A letter from Exeter on the 17th September\r\nshows the danger of famine to have been great there also[567]. On the 23rd\r\nSeptember one of the masons working at Cromwell’s house in Austen Friars\r\nis sick of the plague: three corses were buried at Hackney [of men\r\nemployed at the new house?] last St Matthew’s day. In October the king is\r\non his way back from Gloucestershire, but changes his route owing to a\r\ndeath at Shalford and four deaths at Farnham. On the 24th October the\r\nbishop of Winchester, on his way to Paris, lost his servant at Calais by\r\nthe great sickness “wherewith he was infected at his late being in London\r\nlonger than I would he should:” travelling is cumbrous in the “strange\r\nwatery weather” in France. In November the pope has heard that England is\r\ntroubled with famine and pestilence. The curate of Much Malvern writes in\r\nNovember (but perhaps of 1536): “I have buried four persons of pestilence\r\nsince Saturday, and I have one more to bury to-day. Yesterday I was in a\r\nhouse where the plague is very sore.”\r\n\r\nThe sickness appears to have shown itself again in London as early as\r\nApril, 1536. On the 2nd of May two gentlemen of the Inner Temple had died\r\nof the sickness; on the 15th the abbot of York writes to be excused from\r\nattending Parliament “because of the plague which has visited my house\r\nnear Powles [St Paul’s].” In the same summer the election of knights to\r\nserve in Parliament for Shropshire could not be held at Shrewsbury because\r\nthe plague was in the town. In September one of the king’s visitors of the\r\nabbeys, previous to their suppression, found hardly any place clear of the\r\nplague in Somerset, and was much impeded in his work. On the 27th\r\nSeptember one of the numerous coronations of new queens in Henry VIII.’s\r\nreign (this time Jane Seymour in succession to Anne Boleyn, beheaded in\r\nMay) was like to be postponed “seeing how the plague reigned in\r\nWestminster, even in the Abbey.” On the 9th October plague was at Dieppe,\r\nthought to have been brought over from Rye. In Yorkshire also, the duke of\r\nNorfolk, sent to put down the rebellion in November, 1536, came into close\r\ncontact with plague; many were dying of it at Doncaster: “Where I and my\r\nson lay, at a friar’s, ten or twelve houses were infected within a butt’s\r\nlength. On Friday night the mayor’s wife and two daughters and a servant\r\nall died in one house.” Nine soldiers also were dead. At Oxford the\r\nplague was active, and the scholars had gone into the country. In London\r\non the 27th November it was dangerous to tarry at Lincoln’s Inn “for they\r\ndie daily in the City.” In September, 1536, the small essay on plague by\r\nthe 14th century bishop of Aarhus, which had circulated in manuscript in\r\nthe medieval period and was first printed in 1480, was reprinted at\r\nLondon, the regimen, as the title declares, having been “of late practised\r\nand proved in mani places within the City of London, and by the same many\r\nfolke have been recovered and cured[568].” In 1537 there appear to have\r\nbeen a few cases of plague at Shrewsbury, on account of which the town\r\ncouncil paid certain moneys[569].\r\n\r\nBeyond the year 1538 the domestic records of State are not as yet\r\ncalendared in such fulness as to bring to light any references to plague\r\nin them. It may be, therefore, that the clear interval from 1537 to 1542\r\nis in appearance only. From such sources as are available we can continue\r\nthe history of plague down to the great London plague of 1563; but it is a\r\nhistory meagre and disappointing after the numerous concrete glimpses and\r\ndetails of the earlier period.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1540 was a sickly one throughout England[570]; it introduces\r\nus to a different and perhaps new type of disease, “hot agues,” with\r\n“laskes” or dysenteries, of which a good deal remains to be said in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1539 that Parish Registers of the births, marriages and deaths\r\nbegan to be kept--very irregularly for the most part but in some few\r\nparishes continuously from that year. By their means we can henceforth\r\ntrace the existence of epidemic disease in the country, which might not\r\nhave been suspected or thought probable. Thus, at Watford from July to\r\nSeptember, 1540, there were 47 burials, of which 40 were from “plague.”\r\nNext year, in the month of October, the burials were 14, a number greatly\r\nin excess of the average[571]. In 1543 there was “a great death” in\r\nLondon, which lasted so far into the winter that the Michaelmas law term\r\nhad to be kept at St Albans[572]. Another civic chronicle adds that there\r\nhad been a great death the summer before; and from an ordinance of the\r\nPrivy Council it appears that the plague was in London as early as May 21,\r\n1543[573]. The next definite proof of plague in the capital is under 1547\r\nand 1548. On the 15th November in the former year blue crosses were\r\nordered to be affixed to the door-posts of houses visited by the plague.\r\nIn 1548, says Stow, there was “great pestilence” in London, and a\r\ncommission was issued to curates that there should be no burials between\r\nthe hours of six in the evening and six in the morning, and that the bell\r\nshould be tolled for three-quarters of an hour[574]. A letter of July 19\r\nsays that they had been visited by plague in the Temple, and that it still\r\ncontinued[575]. On August 28, the Common Council adjourned for a fortnight\r\nby reason of the violence of the plague[576].\r\n\r\nThese are the London informations for 1547 and 1548, but it would be\r\nunsafe to conclude that the other years from 1543 were free from plague.\r\nIn 1544 it was raging at Newcastle[577], at Canterbury[578] and at\r\nOxford[579], at which last it continued most of the next year, and was\r\nconsidered to be “the dregs of that which happened _anno_ 1542.” It had\r\nbeen prevalent in Edinburgh previous to June 24, 1545[580]. In April,\r\n1546, there was a severe mortality on board a Venetian ship at Portsmouth,\r\nwhich may have been the plague, as in a similar case at Southampton[581].\r\nIn the autumn or early winter of the same year the plague was raging so\r\nfervently in Devonshire that the Commissioners for the Musters were\r\nobliged to put off their work till it ceased[582]. Within the town of\r\nHaddington, which was held by an English garrison against a large\r\nbesieging force of French and others, plague broke out in 1547[583]. In\r\n1549 the disease is reported from Lincoln[584]. A letter of November 23,\r\n1550, states that the Princess Mary was driven from Wanstead by one dying\r\nof the plague there[585].\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Edward VI. and Mary, full of trouble as they were in other\r\nways, furnish hardly a single record of plague. The sweating sickness of\r\n1551 we hear of sufficiently; and the pestilent fevers, or influenzas, in\r\n1557-58 are not altogether without record; but of plague down to the 5th\r\nyear of Elizabeth (1563) there is very little said, and that little not\r\nfree from ambiguity. Sometime in that interval, or still earlier, must\r\nhave fallen the pestilence at Northampton, severe enough to require the\r\nnew cemetery which cardinal Pole, in a deed of March 9, 1557, ordered to\r\nbe henceforth kept enclosed[586]. Only two of the many centres of sickness\r\nin England in 1558 are said to have had the infection of the type, not of\r\nfever, but of plague,--Loughborough and Chester. In the Leicestershire\r\ntown the burials were numerous enough for true plague, and the cause of\r\nmortality is so named[587]. In Chester also the sickness is called the\r\nplague, and it is added that many fled the town, although the deaths were\r\nfew[588]. A State paper of February 25, 1559, speaks of the county of\r\nCheshire as “weakened by the prevalence of plague[589].”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Plague of 1563.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the plague in London in 1563 made up for its dormancy in\r\nthe years preceding. The epidemic of that summer and autumn was one of the\r\nmost severe in the history of the city, the mortality in proportion to the\r\npopulation having been tremendous. This is the first London plague for\r\nwhich we have the authentic weekly deaths. How they were obtained is not\r\nstated, but it was probably by the same means that furnished the\r\nplague-bills of 1532 and 1535. John Stow must have had before him a\r\ncomplete set of weekly bills from the beginning of June, 1563, to the 26th\r\nof July, 1566, of which series not one is known to be extant; but the\r\ntotals of the weekly deaths from plague for the whole of that period are\r\namong Stow’s manuscript memoranda in the Lambeth Library[590]. After the\r\nweek ending the 31st December, 1563, the weekly deaths are few, many of\r\nthe weeks of 1564, 1565 and 1566 having only one death from plague, and\r\nsome of them none. The following are the weekly mortalities during the\r\nsevere period of the epidemic:\r\n\r\n  Week ending      Plague-deaths\r\n  1563. 12 June          17\r\n        19   \"           25\r\n        26   \"           23\r\n         3 July          44\r\n        10   \"           64\r\n        17   \"          131\r\n        23   \"          174\r\n        30   \"          289\r\n         6 August       299\r\n        13   \"          542\r\n        20   \"          608\r\n        27   \"          976\r\n         3 September    963\r\n        10    \"        1454\r\n        17    \"        1626\r\n        24    \"        1372\r\n         1 October     1828\r\n         8    \"        1262\r\n        15    \"         829\r\n        22    \"        1000\r\n        29    \"         905\r\n         5 November     380\r\n        12    \"         283\r\n        19    \"         506\r\n        26    \"         281\r\n         3 December     178\r\n        10    \"         249\r\n        17    \"         239\r\n        24    \"         134\r\n        31    \"         121\r\n  1564.  7 January       45\r\n        14    \"          26\r\n        21    \"          13\r\n\r\nStow’s summary of this epidemic in his _Annales_ is as follows: “In the\r\nsame whole year, i.e. from the 1st January, 1562 [old style] till the last\r\nof December, 1563, there died in the city and liberties thereof,\r\ncontaining 108 parishes, of all diseases 20,372, and of the plague, being\r\npart of the number aforesaid, 17,404; and in out parishes adjoining to\r\nthe same city, being 11 parishes, died of all diseases in the whole year\r\n3288, and of them of the plague 2732.” The weekly totals from June 12 to\r\nDecember 31 which are for the City and liberties, and exclusive of the out\r\nparishes, add up to very nearly Stow’s total for the whole year, or to\r\n16,802 as against 17,404. Where the discrepancy arises does not appear; it\r\nis hardly likely that some 600 plague-deaths would have occurred previous\r\nto the second week in June, at which time the weekly mortality had reached\r\nonly 17. We are able to check one of the weekly totals from an independent\r\nsource. In an extant letter of the time the following figures for the week\r\nfrom 23rd to 30th July are given, having been taken evidently from the\r\npublished or posted weekly bill: “Died and were buried in London and\r\nsuburbs, 399, most young people and youths, of which number of the common\r\nplague 320 persons. Number of children born and christened in the same\r\nweek, 52[591].” “London and suburbs” would mean the 108 parishes of the\r\nCity and liberties together with the 11 out parishes, so that the\r\ndifference between Stow’s 289 and the above 320 would give the number of\r\nplague-deaths in the out parishes for the particular week.\r\n\r\nThe state of matters in the City is thus referred to in Bullein’s\r\n_Dialogue_ published in 1564:--\r\n\r\n    _Civis._--“Good wife, the daily jangling and ringing of the bells, the\r\n    coming in of the minister to every house in ministering the communion,\r\n    the reading of the homily of death, the digging up of graves, the\r\n    sparring of windows, and the blazing forth of the blue crosses do make\r\n    my heart tremble and quake.” A beggar, in the same _Dialogue_, who had\r\n    arrived from the country, says:\r\n\r\n    “I met with wagones, cartes and horses full loden with yong barnes,\r\n    for fear of the blacke Pestilence, with them boxes of medicens and\r\n    sweete perfumes. O God! how fast did they run by hundredes, and were\r\n    afraied of eche other for feare of smityng.”\r\n\r\nWe get one or two glimpses of this great plague from the medical point of\r\nview in Dr John Jones’s _Dyall of Agues_[592]. The worst locality, he\r\nsays, was “S. Poulkar’s parish [St Sepulchre’s] by reason of many\r\nfruiterers, poor people, and stinking lanes, as Turnagain-lane [so called\r\nbecause it led down the slope to Fleet Ditch and ended there],\r\nSeacoal-lane, and such other places, there died most in London, and were\r\nsoonest infected, and longest continued, as twice since I have known\r\nLondon I have marked to be true.” Jones believed in contagion: “I myself\r\nwas infected by reason that unawares I lodged with one that had it running\r\nfrom him.” His other observation is interesting as proving the possibility\r\nof repeated attacks of the buboes in the same person, an observation\r\nabundantly confirmed, as we shall see, in the London plagues of 1603 and\r\n1665:\r\n\r\n    “Here now, gentel readers, I think good to admonish all such as have\r\n    had the plague, that they flie the trust of ignoraunt persons, who use\r\n    to saye that he who hath once had the plague shal not nede to feare\r\n    the havinge of it anye more: the whych by this example whyche foloweth\r\n    (that chaunced to a certayne Bakers wife without Tempel barre in\r\n    London, Anno Do. 1563) you shall find to be worthelye to be repeated:\r\n    this sayde wyfe had the plage at Midsommer and at Bartholomewtide, and\r\n    at Michaelmas, and the first time it brake, the seconde time it brake,\r\n    but ran littell, the thirde time it appeared and brake not: but she\r\n    died, notwythstanding she was twyce afore healed.”\r\n\r\nTwo London physicians of some note died of the plague in 1563. One was Dr\r\nGeynes, who had brought trouble upon himself by impugning the authority of\r\nGalen, perhaps without sufficient reason. Having been cited before the\r\nCollege of Physicians, to whose discipline he was subject, he preferred to\r\nrecant his heresy rather than undergo imprisonment. He died of plague on\r\n23 July, 1563. Another was Dr John Fryer who had suffered twice for\r\nreligious heresy, having been imprisoned by queen Mary as a Lutheran, and\r\nby queen Elizabeth as a papist. He regained his liberty in August, 1563,\r\nbut only to die of plague on 21 October, his wife and several of his\r\nchildren having been also victims of the epidemic[593].\r\n\r\nStow ascribes the infection of the city of London by plague in the summer\r\nof 1563 to the return of the English troops from Havre, which town queen\r\nElizabeth had boldly attempted to hold, and did actually hold for ten\r\nmonths, from September, 1562, as an English fortress in French territory.\r\nHavre was not surrendered until the last days of July, 1563, and no\r\nreturning troops could have reached London until August, by which time the\r\nplague had been raging there for two months. There was no doubt frequent\r\ncommunication between Havre and English ports while the siege lasted; but\r\nthe sickness in each place can have been no more than coincident. Thus,\r\nwhile there were 17 plague-deaths in London in the week from the 5th to\r\nthe 12th of June, the 7th of June is the first date on which report was\r\nmade of sickness in Havre, although there had been cases of illness\r\nbefore. On that date the Earl of Warwick wrote to the Privy Council[594]:\r\n“For the want of money the works are hindered and the men discouraged. A\r\nstrange disease has come amongst them, whereof nine died this morning (and\r\nmany before) very suddenly.” On the same day (7th June, 1563), one writes\r\nfrom Havre to Cecil: “Many of our men have been hurt in these skirmishes,\r\nbut more by drinking of their wine, which hath cast down a great number,\r\nof hot burning diseases and impostumations, not unlike the plague.” By the\r\n9th June the deaths were from 20 to 30 a day. On the 12th June, 442 were\r\nsick out of a total force (including labourers and seamen) of 7143. On\r\nJune 16, Warwick points out to the Privy Council that the sickness was\r\naggravated by the want of fresh meat and the soldiers’ usual beverages:\r\n“therefore their continual drinking of wine, contrary to their custom, has\r\nbred these disorders and diseases.” On the 28th June the daily mortality\r\nwas 77; from that date it increased somewhat, and was so serious as to\r\nhasten the surrender of the place to the French besieging force in the end\r\nof July. On July 27 there was plague in the castle of Jersey, and on\r\nAugust 6 it was very sore in Jersey, especially in the Castle[595].\r\n\r\nIt would have seemed the more probable to the people of London that the\r\nplague of 1563 had been imported across the Channel by reason of the\r\nunusually long immunity of the English capital in respect of that\r\ninfection. A clear interval of a dozen years without an epidemic, or a\r\nsevere epidemic, was enough to make men forget the long tradition of\r\nplague domesticated upon English soil; while there was no scientific\r\ndoctrine of epidemics then worked out, from which they might have known\r\nthat the seeds of a disease may lie dormant for years, and that their\r\nperiodic effectiveness depends upon a concurrence of favouring things,\r\nmost of all upon extremes of dryness or wetness of the seasons as\r\naffecting a soil full of corrupting animal matters.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 1563 in the capital was accompanied or followed by several\r\nprovincial outbreaks, of which few details are known. It is mentioned at\r\nDerby[596] in 1563, at Leicester[597] in 1563 and 1564 (a shut-up house in\r\n1563, the first plague-burial in St Martin’s parish on May 11, 1564), at\r\nStratford-on-Avon, at Lichfield[598] and Canterbury[599] in 1564. But it\r\nis little more than mentioned at all those places. In the parish register\r\nof Hensley, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, a later incumbent, basing\r\nupon “an old writing of 1569,” says that the explanation of the year 1563\r\nbeing a blank in the register was “because in that year the visitation of\r\nplague was most hot and fearful, so that many died and fled, and the town\r\nof Hensley, by reason of the sickness, was unfrequented for a long\r\nseason[600].”\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Practice in Plague-time under the Tudors.\r\n\r\nHaving now traced the history of plague in London and in the provinces\r\ndown to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, and having found it\r\nsteady from year to year for many years in London, with an occasional\r\nterrific outburst, we are naturally led to ask whether the causes of it,\r\nor its favouring things, were understood, and whether any steps were taken\r\nto deal with it. This will be in effect a review of the earliest\r\npreventive practice.\r\n\r\nThat which was most clearly perceived by all was that the plague began to\r\nreign in certain years as the summer heats drew on, that the air of London\r\nor Westminster became “intemperate,” or unwholesome, or infectious, and\r\nthat it was desirable to get out of such air. Accordingly the one great\r\nrule, admitted by all and acted upon by as many as could, was to escape\r\nfrom the tainted locality, or as Wolsey expressed it to the earl of\r\nShrewsbury in 1516, to get them “into clean air.” There was no other\r\nsovereign prescription but that, and it remained the one great\r\nprescription until the last of plague in 1665-6.\r\n\r\nDifficult points of casuistry arose out of that steady perception of an\r\nindisputable rule. Could flight from a plague-stricken place be reconciled\r\nwith duty to one’s neighbour? How ought a Christian man to demean himself\r\nin the plague? The Christian conscience may or may not have been tender on\r\nthat ground in the medieval period; there is little to show one way or the\r\nother, except the occasional hints that we get, as in the Danish bishop’s\r\ntreatise, of an unwillingness to go near the victims of plague. But about\r\nthe Reformation time those points of casuistry were debated; and one\r\nelaborate handling of them, in the form of a sermon by a German\r\necclesiastic, Osiander, was translated into English in 1537 by Miles\r\nCoverdale[601]. It followed, accordingly, that period of plague in London\r\nwhich has occupied the first part of this chapter. The translator remarks\r\nthat they had been negligent of charity one to another, and he prints this\r\ndiscourse “to the intent that the ignorant may be taught, the weake\r\nstrengthened, and everyone counselled after his callynge to serve his\r\nneighbor.”\r\n\r\nOsiander’s perplexed Christian is in much the same case as Launcelot Gobbo\r\nin the play: “‘Budge,’ says the fiend; ‘Budge not,’ says my conscience.\r\n‘Conscience,’ say I, ‘you counsel well;’ ‘Fiend,’ say I, ‘you counsel\r\nwell.’” The situation was a naturally complex one, and this is how the\r\ngood preacher comes out of it:\r\n\r\n    “It is not my meaning to forbid or inhibit any man to fly, or to use\r\n    physick, or to avoid dangerous and sick places in these fearful\r\n    airs--so far as a man doth not therein against the belief, nor God’s\r\n    commandment, nor against his calling, nor against the love of his\r\n    neighbour.” And yet, shortly after: “Out of such fond childish fear it\r\n    cometh that not only some sick folk be suffered to die away without\r\n    all keeping, help, and comfort; but the women also, great with child,\r\n    be forsaken in their need, or else cometh there utterly no man unto\r\n    them. Yet a man may hear also that the children forsake their fathers\r\n    and mothers, and one household body keepeth himself away from another,\r\n    and sheweth no love unto him. Which nevertheless he would be glad to\r\n    see shewed unto himself if he lay in like necessity.” He then exhorts\r\n    the Christian man to remain at the post of duty, by the examples of\r\n    the clergy and of “the higher powers of the world, who also abide in\r\n    jeopardy”--certainly not the English experience. “Let him not axe his\r\n    own reason, how he shall do, but believe, and follow the word of God,\r\n    which teacheth him not to fly evil air and infect places (which he may\r\n    well do: nevertheless he remaineth yet uncertain whether it helpeth or\r\n    no).” The Christian man’s perplexities can hardly have been resolved\r\n    when all was said; and the following sentence puts the case for\r\n    quitting the infected place as strongly as it can be put: “For if it\r\n    were in meat or drink, it might be eschewed; if it were an evil taste,\r\n    it might be expelled with a sweet savour; if it were an evil wind, the\r\n    chamber might with diligence be made close therefore; if it were a\r\n    cloud or mist, it might be seen and avoided; if it were a rain, a man\r\n    might cover himself for it. But now it is a secret misfortune that\r\n    creepeth in privily, so that it can neither be seen nor heard, neither\r\n    smelled nor tasted, till it have done the harm.”\r\n\r\nIn practice the rule was ‘Save who can;’ so that whenever the infection\r\npromised to become “hot,” as the phrase was, there was an adjournment of\r\nParliament and of the Law Courts, a flight of all who could afford it to\r\nthe country, and an interruption of business, diplomatic and other, which\r\nsometimes lasted for months. It was only occasionally, however, that the\r\ninfection became really hot; in ordinary years a certain risk was run.\r\nThus, in 1426, the plague had been severe enough to cut off the Scots\r\nhostages; but it was not until after their death that the king’s council\r\nleft the city. Again, in 1467, Parliament did not adjourn (on 1st July)\r\nuntil several members of the House of Commons had died of the plague.\r\n\r\nAlthough flight was the sovereign preventive in a great plague-season, it\r\nwas impracticable in ordinary years when the infection was at its steadier\r\nor more endemic level. The endemic level was tolerated up to a certain\r\npoint. In a long despatch to his government, the Venetian ambassador in\r\nLondon wrote of the plague as follows in 1554[602]:\r\n\r\n    “They have some little plague in England well nigh every year, for\r\n    which they are not accustomed to make sanitary provisions, as it does\r\n    not usually make great progress; the cases for the most part occur\r\n    amongst the lower classes, as if their dissolute mode of life impaired\r\n    their constitutions.”\r\n\r\nWhenever the plague showed signs of overstepping these limits, strenuous\r\nefforts were made to keep it in check. It may be questioned whether all\r\nthat was done in that way made any difference; the great outbursts came at\r\nintervals, rose to their height, subsided in a few months, and left the\r\ncity more or less free of plague until some concurrence of things, or the\r\nlapse of time, brought about another epidemic of the first degree. None\r\nthe less, certain measures were taken to restrain the infection, and these\r\nwere put in force with mechanical regularity whenever the Privy Council\r\ninformed the Lord Mayor that the occasion required it. A brief account of\r\nthem, of their beginnings and their development, will now be given.\r\n\r\nThe first that we hear of attempts at isolation and notification is in\r\n1518. In April of that year, the Court being in Berkshire or Oxfordshire,\r\nSir Thomas More charged the mayor of Oxford, and the commissary, in the\r\nking’s name “that the inhabitants of those houses that be, and shall be\r\ninfected, shall keep in, put out wispes, and bear white rods, as your\r\nGrace devised for Londoners[603].” By his Grace is to be understood the\r\nking himself; and these measures devised by him--the keeping in, the\r\nputting out of wisps on the houses, and the carrying of white rods,--might\r\nhave been tried as early as the epidemic of 1513, which was a severe one.\r\nWhen two of the Venetian ambassador’s servants died of the plague in 1513,\r\ntheir bed, sheets and other effects were thrown into the river. On the\r\n21st of May, 1516, the ambassador removed to Putney owing to a case of\r\nplague in his house, and he was not allowed to see cardinal Wolsey until\r\nthe 30th of June, i.e. until forty days had elapsed. This is perhaps the\r\nfirst mention of the quarantine which the Court rigorously put in\r\npractice against those who had business with it. On the 22nd July, 1518,\r\nthe same ambassador wrote to Venice from Lambeth that two of his servants\r\nhad lately died of the plague; and, on the 11th August, again from\r\nLambeth, that the king and Wolsey would not see him because of the plague;\r\n“but on the expiration of forty days, which had nearly come to an end, he\r\nwould not fail to do his duty as heretofore.”\r\n\r\nOn the 25th August, 1535, Chapuys, in a letter to Charles V., gives an\r\namusing account of an attempt made by the French ambassador to see Henry\r\nVIII. and Cromwell on diplomatic business. The Court was residing in\r\nGloucestershire owing to plague in and near London (it was at Bristol\r\nalso), and the ambassador journeyed thither to carry his business through.\r\nHowever he went no nearer than six miles, because a “French merchant” who\r\nfollowed him died upon the road of the plague, as it was feared. The king\r\nasked him to put his charge in writing, but the ambassador replied that he\r\nhad orders to tell it in person, and that he could wait. At length he lay\r\nin wait for Secretary Cromwell in the fields where he went to hunt with\r\nthe dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and delivered his charge despite the\r\nmanifest unwillingness of Cromwell, who came away from the improvised\r\ndiplomatic interview in no good humour.\r\n\r\nThe first plague-order of which the full text is extant was issued in the\r\n35th of Henry VIII. (1543). As it contains the germs of all subsequent\r\npreventive practice, I transcribe it in full[604].\r\n\r\n    “35 Hen. VIII. A precept issued to the aldermen:--That they should\r\n    cause their beadles to set the sign of the cross on every house which\r\n    should be afflicted with the plague, and there continue for forty\r\n    days:\r\n\r\n    “That no person who was able to live by himself, and should be\r\n    afflicted with the plague, should go abroad or into any company for\r\n    one month after his sickness, and that all others who could not live\r\n    without their daily labour should as much as in them lay refrain from\r\n    going abroad, and should for forty days after [illegible] and\r\n    continually carry a white rod in their hand, two foot long:\r\n\r\n    “That every person whose house had been infected should, after a\r\n    visitation, carry all the straw and [illegible] in the night privately\r\n    into the fields and burn; they should also carry clothes of the\r\n    infected in the fields to be cured:\r\n\r\n    “That no housekeeper should put any person diseased out of his house\r\n    into the street or other place unless they provided housing for them\r\n    in some other house:\r\n\r\n    “That all persons having any dogs in their houses other than hounds,\r\n    spaniels or mastiffs, necessary for the custody or safe keeping of\r\n    their houses, should forthwith convey them out of the city, or cause\r\n    them to be killed and carried out of the city and buried at the common\r\n    laystall:\r\n\r\n    “That such as kept hounds, spaniels, or mastiffs should not suffer\r\n    them to go abroad, but closely confine them:\r\n\r\n    “That the churchwardens of every parish should employ somebody to keep\r\n    out all common beggars out of churches on holy days, and to cause them\r\n    to remain without doors:\r\n\r\n    “That all the streets, lanes, etc. within the wards should be\r\n    cleansed:\r\n\r\n    “That the aldermen should cause this precept to be read in the\r\n    churches.”\r\n\r\nHere we see a development of the measures which had been devised for\r\nLondon by Henry VIII. or his minister previous to 1518, and probably in\r\nthe plague of 1513. The wisps put out on the infected houses are replaced\r\nby crosses, which, in the order of 1543, are simply called “the sign of\r\nthe cross.” They are next heard of during the plague of 1547, in a\r\nGuildhall record of 15 November[605]:\r\n\r\n    “Item, for as moche as my Lord Mayer reported that my Lorde Chauncelar\r\n    declared unto hym that my Lorde Protectour’s Grace’s pleasure ys, and\r\n    other of the Lordes of the Counseyll, that certain open tokens and\r\n    sygnes shulde be made and sett furth in all such places of the Cytie\r\n    as haue of late been vysyted with the plage”--be it therefore ordained\r\n    that a certain cross of St Anthony devised for that purpose be affixed\r\n    to the uttermost post of the street door, there to remain forty days\r\n    after the setting up thereof.\r\n\r\nThe cross of St Anthony was a headless cross, and the crutch is supposed\r\nto have been painted (in blue) on canvas or board and fixed to the post of\r\nthe street door. The legend under or over the cross was, “Lord have mercy\r\nupon us.” Before the plague of 1603, the colour had been changed to red.\r\n\r\nThe white rods, which had been devised along with the wisps previous to\r\n1518, are mentioned in the order of 1543 as two foot long; they were to\r\nbe carried for forty days by those who must needs go abroad from\r\nplague-stricken houses. We hear of them again, both in France and in\r\nEngland in 1580 and 1581. On the 20th November, 1580, the Venetian\r\nambassador to France writes from the neighbourhood of Paris: “This city, I\r\nhear, is in a very fair sanitary condition, notwithstanding that as I\r\nentered a city gate, which is close to where I reside, I met a man and a\r\nwoman bearing the white plague wands in their hands and asking alms; but\r\nsome believe that this was merely an artifice on their part to gain\r\nmoney[606].” In the regulations for plague added in 1581 by the mayor of\r\nLondon to the earlier code, the third is: “That no persons dwelling in a\r\nhouse infected be suffered to go abroad unless they carry with them a\r\nwhite wand of a yard long; any so offending to be committed to the Cage.”\r\nIn the seventeenth-century plagues of London and provincial towns, the\r\nwhite wand was retained as the peculiar badge of the searchers of infected\r\nhouses and of the bearers of the dead. The white rod or wand carried by\r\ninmates of infected houses, had become a red rod in the plague of 1603,\r\njust as the blue cross had been changed to red.\r\n\r\nThe other directions in the order of 1543 are heard of from time to time\r\nin the subsequent history of plague--such as the burning of straw, and the\r\ncleansing of the streets. The Guildhall record of 15 November, 1547, after\r\ndirecting the blue crosses to be affixed to houses, proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “And also to cause all the welles and pumpes within their seid wardes\r\n    to be drawen iii times euerye weke, that is to say, Monday, Wednesday,\r\n    and Friday. And to cast down into the canelles at euerye such drawyng\r\n    xii bucketts full of water at the least, to clense the stretes\r\n    wythall.”\r\n\r\nUnder Elizabeth, the orders as to scavenging become much more stringent,\r\nas we shall see. In the plague of 1563, on 29 September, the Common\r\nCouncil appointed “two poor men to burn and bury such straw, clothes, and\r\nbedding as they shall find in the fields near the city or within the city,\r\nwhereon any person in the plague hath lyen or dyed[607].”\r\n\r\nThe curious order as to dogs was based upon the belief that they carried\r\nthe infection in their hair, just as cats are now believed by some to\r\ncarry infection in their fur. Brasbridge, in his _Poor Man’s Jewel_\r\n(1578), gives a case of a glover at Oxford, into whose house a disastrous\r\nplague-infection was supposed to have been brought by means of a dog’s\r\nskin bought in London[608]. The plague-regulations contained the clause\r\nagainst dogs to the last; in the great plagues of 1603, 1625, and 1665,\r\nthousands of them were killed, many of them having been doubtless left\r\nbehind in the exodus of the well-to-do classes. In the corporation records\r\nof Winchester[609], there is a minute, undated, but probably belonging to\r\nthe end of the 16th century, that dogs shall be kept indoors “if any house\r\nwithin the city shall happen to be infected with the plague.” A\r\nproclamation during the London plague of 1563 is directed against cats as\r\nwell as dogs, “for the avoidance of the plague:” officers were appointed\r\nto kill and bury all such as they found at large[610].\r\n\r\nThe great London plague of 1563 had revived the old practices and given\r\nrise to some new ones. Curates and churchwardens were directed to warn the\r\ninmates of houses where plague had occurred not to come to church for a\r\ncertain space thereafter[611]. The blue crosses were again in great\r\nrequest, being ordered by hundreds at a time in readiness to affix to\r\ninfected houses[612]. Also it was ordered by the Mayor and Council that\r\nthe “filthie dunghill lying in the highway near unto Fynnesburye Courte be\r\nremoved and carried away; and not to suffer any such donge or fylthe from\r\nhensforthe there to be leyde[613].” On the 9th of July, 1563, plague\r\nhaving been already at work for several weeks, a commission was issued by\r\nthe queen in Council, that every householder in London should, at seven\r\nin the evening, lay out wood and make bonfires in the streets and lanes,\r\nto the intent that they should thereby consume the corrupt airs, the fires\r\nto be made on three days of the week[614]. On 30th September, 1563, it was\r\nordered that all such houses as were infected should have their doors and\r\nwindows shut up, and the inmates not to stir out nor suffer any to come to\r\nthem for forty days. At the same time, a collection was ordered to be made\r\nin the churches for the relief of the poor afflicted with the plague, and\r\nthus shut up. Another order was that new mould should be laid on the\r\ngraves of such as die of the plague. Still another, the first of a long\r\nseries, was to prohibit all interludes and plays during the\r\ninfection[615]. On the 2nd December, when the deaths had fallen to 178 in\r\nthe week, an order was issued by the Common Council that houses in which\r\nthe plague had been were not to be let. On the 20th January, 1564, there\r\nwas an order for a general airing and cleansing of houses, bedding and the\r\nlike. By that time the deaths had fallen to 13 in the week.\r\n\r\nThe most rigorous measures in this plague were those which queen Elizabeth\r\ntook for her own safety at Windsor in September. Stow says that “a gallows\r\nwas set up in the market-place of Windsor to hang all such as should come\r\nthere from London. No wares to be brought to, or through, or by Windsor;\r\nnor any one on the river by Windsor to carry wood or other stuff to or\r\nfrom London, upon pain of hanging without any judgment; and such people as\r\nreceived any wares out of London into Windsor were turned out of their\r\nhouses, and their houses shut up[616].”\r\n\r\nIn 1568 a more complete set of instructions to the aldermen of the several\r\nwards was drawn up by the Lord Mayor, and a corresponding order for the\r\ncity of Westminster by Sir William Cecil, Secretary of State, and by the\r\nChancellor of the Duchy. In 1581 some additional orders were issued by the\r\nLord Mayor. The whole of these are here given from a state paper in a\r\nlater handwriting, probably of the time of James I. or Charles I[617].\r\n\r\n    A collection of such papers as are found in the office of his\r\n    Majesties papers and records for business of state for the preventing\r\n    and decreasing of the plague in and about London.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. (City of London, 1568.)\r\n\r\n    1. First a ’tre from the Mayor of London to every alderman of each\r\n    warde to charge their Deputys counstables and officers to make search\r\n    of all houses infected within each parish.\r\n\r\n    2. To cause all infected houses to bee shutt up and noe person to come\r\n    forth in twenty dayes after the infection.\r\n\r\n    3. That some honest discreete person be appoynted to attend each such\r\n    infected house to provide them of all necessaries at the cost of the\r\n    M{r} of the house if he be able.\r\n\r\n    4. For the poorer houses infected that the Alderman or his deputy doe\r\n    cause to make collection for the supply of all necessaries to be\r\n    charged upon the wealthyer sorte of the same warde or parish.\r\n\r\n    5. That such as shall refuse to pay what they are assest shall be\r\n    committed to warde untill they pay it.\r\n\r\n    6. That all bedding and cloathes and other thinges apt to take\r\n    infection which were about infected persons bee burnt or such order\r\n    taken that infection may not be increased by them.\r\n\r\n    7. Lastly that a bill with ‘Lord have mercy upon us’ in greate ’tres\r\n    bee sett over the dore of euery infected house and that the\r\n    counstables and Beadles have a care to see that the same be not taken\r\n    downe.\r\n\r\n    These orders were sett downe by the Mayior of London in the yeere\r\n    1568, whereupon queene Elizabeth writeth a letter to S{r} William\r\n    Cycill then secretary and S{r} Ambrous Cave, chauncellor of the Duchy\r\n    to take the like order or any other that they should thinke fitt in\r\n    the citie of Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n    B. (City of Westminster, 1568.)\r\n\r\n    Orders sett down by S{r} William Cycill, Secretary, as High Steward of\r\n    Westminster and S{r} Ambrous Cave, chauncellor of the Dutchy to the\r\n    Bayleiffes, Hedburroughs, Counstables and other officers of the sayde\r\n    Citty.\r\n\r\n    1. That they should follow the good example of the orders devised and\r\n    observed by the Mayior and Aldermen of London, and further that all\r\n    that haue any houses shops or loggings that hath had any infection in\r\n    them by the space of twenty dayes before the making of these orders\r\n    shall shutt up all their doares and windoares towards the streetes and\r\n    common passages for forty dayes next and not suffer after the tyme of\r\n    the sicknes any person to goe forth nor any uninfected to come in upon\r\n    payne that euery offender shall sitt seven dayes in the stocks and\r\n    after that be committed to the common Goale there to remayne forty\r\n    dayes from the first day of his being in the stocks.\r\n\r\n    2. That the officers aforesayde with the curate of euery parish and\r\n    churchwardens doe make such collection of the rest of the parishioners\r\n    as shall be necessary for the sustenance of such as bee poore infected\r\n    and shutt up.\r\n\r\n    3. To discharge all inmates out of all houses that there be noe more\r\n    persons in one house then be of one family except they be lodgers for\r\n    a small time.\r\n\r\n    4. To cause the streetes lanes and passages and all the shewers sinkes\r\n    (?) and gutters thereof dayly to be made sweete and cleane.\r\n\r\n\r\n    C. (London, 1581.)\r\n\r\n    There were added by the Mayior of London to the former articles these\r\n    following in the year 1581.\r\n\r\n    1. That speciall noatis be taken of such houses infected as sell\r\n    cloth, silke and other wares and make garments and aparrell for men\r\n    and women.\r\n\r\n    2. That euery counstable within his precinct haue at all tymes in\r\n    readines two honest and discreete women to attend any house infected.\r\n\r\n    3. That noe person dwelling in a house infected bee suffered to goe\r\n    abroade unless they carry with them a white wand of a yarde long. Any\r\n    soe offending to bee committed to the Cage there to remayne untill\r\n    order shallbe taken by the Mayior or his bretheren.\r\n\r\n    4. That they suffer not any deade corps dying of the plague to be\r\n    buryed in tyme of divine service or sermon.\r\n\r\n    5. To appoynt two honest and discreete matrons within euery parish who\r\n    shall bee sworne truely to search the body of euery such person as\r\n    shall happen to dye within the same parish, to the ende that they make\r\n    true reporte to the clerke of the parish church of all such as shall\r\n    dye of the plague, that the same clerke may make the like reporte and\r\n    certificate to the wardens of the parish clerkes thereof according to\r\n    the order in that behalfe heretofore provided.\r\n\r\n    If the viewers through favour or corruption shall giue wrong\r\n    certificate, or shall refuse to serue being thereto appointed, then to\r\n    punish them by imprisonment in such sorte as may serue for the terror\r\n    of others.\r\n\r\n    6. That order be taken for killing of dogs that run from house to\r\n    house dispersing the plague, and that noe swine be suffered or kept\r\n    within the citty[618].\r\n\r\nSeveral of these plague-regulations had been in force, as we have seen,\r\nfrom near the beginning of the century. Others, not hitherto mentioned,\r\nwere also of earlier date. Thus the collections for the poor are\r\nmentioned in the diary of a London citizen in 1538 and 1539, but not\r\nspecially in connexion with plague. They are heard of often after the\r\nplague of 1563, along with other provisions for the poor which mark the\r\nreign of Elizabeth. If we may trust Bullein’s _Dialogue_ of 1564, a\r\nsystematic provision became necessary because private charity was no\r\nlonger to be depended on. In many country towns and parishes, as we shall\r\nsee, the contributions or compensations to the inmates of shut-up houses\r\nin the Elizabethan plagues were paid out of the municipal funds, either\r\nthose of the affected place or of some “unvisited” neighbouring town. The\r\nAct of Parliament which most directly provided for “the charitable relief\r\nof persons infected with the plague” was the 1st James I. (1603-4), cap.\r\n31.\r\n\r\nA most essential part of the means for controlling plague was the\r\ninstitution of searchers[619]. In the orders of 1543, the aldermen of the\r\nwards are directed to send their beadles to affix the sign of the cross to\r\naffected houses. But in due course these duties of inspection,\r\nnotification, isolation and registration passed in London into the hands\r\nof the Company of Parish Clerks. The original business of the Parish\r\nClerks was with church music. In the thirteenth century they received a\r\ncharter of incorporation as the Clerks of St Nicholas, and became\r\nassociated with that love of choral singing which has always distinguished\r\nthe English people. Legacies and endowments fell to them for the\r\nperformance of specific services, or for their encouragement in general.\r\nFrom time to time the Company would appear in a particular parish church\r\nto sing a mass. It was the singular history of a Company which gained its\r\ngreatest name as the Registrars of Births and Deaths in London down to the\r\nRegistration Act of 1837, to have been not only the first Choral Society\r\nbut also the first company of stage players. In 1391, says Stow, a play\r\nwas given by the parish clerks of London at the Skinners’ Well beside\r\nSmithfield, which continued three days together, the king, queen and\r\nnobles of the realm being present. Another play, in the year 1409, lasted\r\neight days, “and was of matter from the creation of the world, whereat\r\nwas present most of the nobility and gentry of England[620].”\r\n\r\nIn the time of Sir Thomas More, a parish clerk meant one who sang in the\r\nchurch choir. When More was lord chancellor, the duke of Norfolk came one\r\nday to dine with him at his house at Chelsea, and not finding him at home,\r\nwent in search of him. He found him, where posterity will long delight to\r\npicture him,--in the church “singing in the choir with a surplice on his\r\nback.” As they walked home arm in arm the duke said to Sir Thomas More: “A\r\nparish clerk! a parish clerk! God body, my lord chancellor, you dishonour\r\nthe king and his office;” whereon the chancellor answered as if he did not\r\ntake the duke altogether seriously.\r\n\r\nThe whole strength of the Company of Parish Clerks in those times would\r\nattend the funeral of some rich person, as we may read in the\r\nsixteenth-century diary of Machyn the undertaker (sometimes the Company\r\nchosen to follow the body to the grave was that of the Tallow Chandlers,\r\nas in the case of John Stow’s mother). It was no great step from their old\r\nduties to their new. There were, as we have seen, bills of mortality\r\ncompiled weekly for all the parishes in the city and liberties as early as\r\n1532 and 1535. It is not said that the Parish Clerks were the collectors\r\nof the information, but they were as likely to have been so as any other\r\npersons whom the mayor would employ. Bills were also drawn up for a few\r\nweeks during the sweating sickness of 1551, and again for an unbroken\r\nseries of some two hundred weeks from the beginning of the plague of 1563.\r\nThe figures are preserved from a single weekly bill, 22-28 October, 1574,\r\nwhich must have been one of a series[621]. The next bills known are a\r\nseries for five years, 1578-83, a plague-period of which more will have to\r\nbe said in its proper place in the chronology.\r\n\r\nThe orders of 1581, already given, make mention of the two discreet\r\nmatrons within every parish who shall be sworn truly to search the body of\r\nevery such person as shall happen to die within the same parish, of their\r\nreporting to the clerk of the parish, and of the clerk making report and\r\ncertificate to the wardens of the Parish Clerks, who would send the weekly\r\ncertificate for all the parishes to the mayor, and he to the minister of\r\nState. That was said to be “according to the order in that behalf\r\nheretofore provided.” It is probable, therefore, that the searchers became\r\nan institution as early as the plague of 1563, or, at all events, at the\r\nbeginning of the plague-period of 1578-83.\r\n\r\nThe clerk of the Company in 1665 describes how the discreet matrons were\r\nchosen as searchers or viewers of the dead in each parish, and how they\r\nwere sworn to discharge their duties faithfully[622]. The swearing in took\r\nplace before the Dean of the Arches, that is to say, in St Mary le Bow\r\nchurch (“St Mary of the Arch”) in Cheapside. The motive to bribe them for\r\na wrong report on the cause of death was to avoid the shutting up and all\r\nother troubles of a household pronounced infected by the plague. In later\r\ntimes their diagnostic duties became, as we shall see, much more complex;\r\nbut down to 1604, when they first brought to the Parish Clerks’ Hall “an\r\naccount of the diseases and casualties” (which classification and\r\nnomenclature did not begin to be printed until 1629), they had merely to\r\nsay whether a death had been from plague or from other cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanitation in Plantagenet and Tudor times.\r\n\r\nAlong with all those means, having the object of stopping the spread of\r\ninfection, the Elizabethan policy did not neglect what we should now\r\nconsider the more radical means of sanitation. It is usual to bring a\r\nsweeping charge of neglect of public hygiene against all old times; there\r\nwas so much plague in those times, and so high an average death-rate, that\r\nit is commonly assumed that our ancestors must have been wanting in the\r\nrudimentary instincts of cleanliness. But, in the first place, one might\r\nexpect to find that all old periods were not alike; and more generally it\r\nis worth inquiring how far nuisances injurious to the public health were\r\ntolerated. This inquiry will have to be as brief as possible; but it will\r\ntake us back to the period of plague covered by a former chapter.\r\n\r\nNuisances certainly existed in medieval London, but it is equally certain\r\nthat they were not tolerated without limit. I have collected in a note the\r\ninstances reported in a visitation of 17 Edward III. (1343), and in a\r\nperambulation of the ground outside the walls in 26 Edward III. (1352).\r\nThe former related only to the alleys leading down to the river, which\r\nwere likely enough places for nuisance, then as now[623].\r\n\r\nThere are several orders of Edward III. relating to the removal of\r\nlaystalls and to keeping the town ditch clean, which show, of course, that\r\nthere was neglect, but at the same time the disposition to correct it. It\r\nis farther obvious that the connexion between nuisances and the public\r\nhealth was clearly apprehended. The sanitary doctrines of modern times\r\nwere undreamt of; nor did the circumstances altogether call for them. The\r\nsewers of those days were banked-up water courses, or “shores” as the word\r\nwas pronounced, which ran uncovered down the various declivities of the\r\ncity, to the town ditch and to the Thames. They would have sufficed to\r\ncarry off the refuse of a population of some forty or sixty thousand; they\r\nwere, at all events, freely open to the greatest of all purifying agents,\r\nthe oxygen of the air; and they poisoned neither the water of the town\r\nditch (which abounded in excellent fish within John Stow’s memory) nor the\r\nwaters of Thames. In course of time all the brooks of London were covered\r\nin, even the Fleet dyke itself, which used to float barges as far as\r\nHolborn bridge; but who shall say that they were more wholesome\r\nthereafter, although they were underground? Perhaps the poet of the\r\n_Earthly Paradise_ has as true an intuition as any when, in reference to\r\nthe city in Chaucer’s time, he bids us\r\n\r\n  “Dream of London, small, and white, and clean;\r\n   The clear Thames bordered by its gardens green.”\r\n\r\nThe nuisance that gave most trouble in the medieval and Tudor periods was\r\nthe blood and offal of the shambles. Several ordinances of Edward III. are\r\ndirected against it, in one of which (1371) the connexion between\r\nputrefying blood soaked into the ground and infectious disease is clearly\r\nstated. It is also the principal subject of the first sanitary Act that\r\nappears in the Statutes of the Realm, made by the Parliament of Cambridge\r\nin the 17th of Richard II. (1388), of which I give the preamble and\r\nprovisions:\r\n\r\n    “Item, For that so much Dung and Filth of the Garbage and Intrails as\r\n    well of Beasts killed as of other Corruptions be cast and put in\r\n    Ditches, Rivers and other Waters, and also within many other Places\r\n    within about and nigh unto divers Cities, Boroughs and Towns of the\r\n    Realm, and the Suburbs of them, that the Air there is greatly corrupt\r\n    and infect, and many Maladies and other intolerable Diseases do daily\r\n    happen,” both to the residents and to visitors:--therefore\r\n    proclamation is to be made in the City of London, as in other cities,\r\n    boroughs and towns “that all they which do cast and lay all such\r\n    Annoyances, Dung, Garbages, Intrails and other Ordure in Ditches,\r\n    Rivers, Waters and other places shall cause them to be removed,\r\n    avoided and carried away betwixt this and the feast of St Michael next\r\n    following,” under a penalty of twenty pounds, mayors and bailiffs to\r\n    compel obedience. Such offences were not to be repeated, and if any\r\n    did offend he was liable to be called by writ before the Chancellor\r\n    “at his suit that will complain[624].”\r\n\r\nDespite this statute, the shambles in the parish of St Nicholas within\r\nNewgate (adjoining the ground now occupied by Christ’s Hospital, and\r\nformerly by the Grey Friars) became an established institution of the\r\ncity. They were a subject of petition to Parliament in 1488-9, and they\r\nwere still there to give occasion in 1603 to severe remarks by Thomas\r\nLodge, poet and physician, who practised in Warwick Lane, in their\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. The Act of 1388, it will be observed, was to be\r\nset in motion “at his suit that will complain;” so that there was little\r\nmore in it than the immemorial remedy from a nuisance at common law.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry V. appears to have been marked by care for the public\r\nhealth, perhaps not greater than in Edward III.’s time, but exceptional,\r\nin the records at least, under the later Plantagenets and until the\r\naccession of the Tudor dynasty. Among other evidences (some of which may\r\nbe gathered from Stow’s _Survey_) is the ordinance of 1415 (3 Hen. V.)\r\nagainst a nuisance in the Moor, beyond the wall and the ditch on the\r\nFinsbury side. The Moor was, in Fitzstephen’s words, “a great fen, which\r\nwatereth the walls on the north side.” In 1415 there was a “common\r\nlatrine” in it, and “sicknesses arose from the horrible, corrupt, and\r\ninfected atmosphere,” issuing therefrom[625]. Its removal was ordered, and\r\nin the same year (1415) chaussées were built across the fen, one to Hoxton\r\nand another to Islington. The ditch all the way round from the Tower to\r\nBlackfriars had been cleansed the year before (1414).\r\n\r\nAnother statute, 3 Henry VII. (1488-9) cap. 3, may be quoted to show that\r\nthe slaughter-houses were the chief nuisance, that their effects on health\r\nwere perceived (as in Edward III.’s time), and that it was necessary to\r\nappeal to the king’s personal interest in the matter as a motive for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\n    Petition to the King from the parishioners of St Faiths and St\r\n    Gregories in London, near St Pauls.\r\n\r\n    “That it was soo that grete concourse of peple, as well of his Roial\r\n    persone as of other grete Lordes and astates wyth other hys true\r\n    subgettes often tymes was had unto the said Cathedrall Chirche, and\r\n    for the moost part through oute the parisshe aforesaide, the whiche\r\n    often tymes ben gretly ennoyed and invenemed by corrupt eires,\r\n    engendered in the said parisshes by occasion of bloode and other\r\n    fowler thynges, by occasion of the slaughter of bestes and scaldyng of\r\n    swyne had and doon in the bocherie of Seynt Nicholas Flesshamls, whos\r\n    corrupcion by violence of unclene and putrified waters is borne down\r\n    thrugh the said parishes and compasseth two partes of the Palays where\r\n    the Kynges most Roiall persone is wonte to abide when he cometh to the\r\n    Cathedrall Chirche for ony acte there to be doon, to the Jubardouse\r\n    [jeopardous] abydyng of his most noble persone and to ouer grete\r\n    ennoysaunce of the parisshens there, and of other the Kyngis subgettes\r\n    and straungers that passe by the same;\r\n\r\n    Compleynte whereof at dyverse and many seasons almost by the space of\r\n    xvi yeres contynuelly, as well by the Chanons and petty Chanons of the\r\n    said Cathedrall Chirche, londlordes there ... made to Mayor and\r\n    aldermen of the city; and noo remedie had ne founden.\r\n\r\n    ... Considering that in few noble cities or towns or none within\r\n    Christendom, where as travellyng men have labored, that the comen\r\n    slaughter hous of bestys sholde be kept in ony speciall parte within\r\n    the walle of the same lest it myght engender Siknesse to the\r\n    destruccion of the peple.”\r\n\r\n    The King etc. “ordeyned and stablished that no Bocher shall sley\r\n    within the said house called the Scaldinghouse or within the walls of\r\n    London.”\r\n\r\n    And the same “in eny citte, Burghe and Towne walled within the Realm\r\n    of Englonde and in the Towne of Cambridge, the Townes of Berwyk and\r\n    Carlile only except and forprised.”\r\n\r\nThe popular knowledge of and belief in a high doctrine of contagion are\r\ncuriously shown by the terms of the Act touching Upholsterers in 1495 (II\r\nHen. VII. cap. 19).\r\n\r\n    The Act was intended to prevent beds, feather-beds, bolsters and\r\n    pillows from being sold in market outside London, “beyond control of\r\n    the Craft of Upholders.” Outside the craft an inferior article was apt\r\n    to be offered, which was at once a lowering of a good and worthy\r\n    standard and a danger to health. There were two kinds of corrupt\r\n    bed-stuffs “contagious for mannys body to lye on,” firstly, scalded\r\n    feathers and dry pulled feathers together; and secondly, flocks and\r\n    feathers together. Besides these, quilts, mattresses and cushions\r\n    stuffed with horse hair, fen down, neat’s hair, deer’s hair and goat’s\r\n    hair, “which is wrought in lyme fattes,” give out by the heat of man’s\r\n    body, a savour and taste so abominable and contagious that many of the\r\n    King’s subjects thereby have been destroyed. These corrupt and\r\n    unlawful stuffs and wares might indeed be made by any person or\r\n    persons for their own proper use in their houses, so they be not\r\n    offered for sale in fairs or markets.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry VIII. is not marked by any ordinances or Acts for the\r\nrestraint of plague or the like sickness by other than quarantine\r\nmeasures. The common ditch between Aldgate and the postern of the Tower\r\nwas cleansed in 1519 at the charges of the city; in 1540 the Moor ditch\r\nwas cleansed: and, not long before, the ditch from the Tower to Aldgate.\r\nIn 1549 the ditch was again cleansed at the charges of the City\r\nCompanies[626]. In April, 1552, John Shakespeare, the poet’s father, a\r\ncitizen of Stratford-on-Avon in good circumstances and afterwards mayor of\r\nthe town, was fined twelve pence (eight to ten shillings present value)\r\nfor not removing the heap of household dirt and refuse that had\r\naccumulated in front of his own door[627]. In the records of the borough\r\nof Ipswich[628], scavengers are mentioned in the 32nd of Henry VIII.\r\n(1540): they were elected in every parish, and the gatherings of refuse\r\nordered to be carried and laid at four places, namely: Warwick Pitts,\r\nCollege Yard, behind the Ditches next John Herne, and the Dikes in the\r\nMarsh. When queen Elizabeth visited Ipswich (in 1561, 1565 and 1577), she\r\nrated not only the clergy on the laxity of their behaviour, but also the\r\ncivic authorities upon the filthy condition of the streets. “A marked\r\nimprovement,” says the borough historian, “certainly took place in Ipswich\r\nat this period, as is incontestably shown by the constant exhortations and\r\npromulgations of laws for the preservation of cleanliness.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Description and Account of the City of Exeter_, written by John\r\nVowell, or Hoker, chamberlain of the city and member of Parliament for it\r\nin the reign of Elizabeth[629], we find the following about the offices\r\nand duties of scavengers “as of old.”\r\n\r\n    They are “necessary officers who cannot be wanting in any\r\n    well-governed city or town, because by them and their service all\r\n    things noisome to the health of man, and hurtful to the state of the\r\n    body of the commonwealth, are advertised unto the magistrate, and so\r\n    they be the means of the redress thereof. And therefore they be called\r\n    Scavengers, as who saith Shewers or Advertisers, for so the word\r\n    soundeth.” Among other duties they had the oversight of pavements,\r\n    that they were swept weekly, of slaughter-houses, dunghills and the\r\n    like, of dangerous buildings and of encroachments upon the streets,\r\n    of chimneys, and of precautions against fires (tubs of water to be in\r\n    readiness at the doors to quench fires and cleanse the streets); and\r\n    on Sundays they had to attend the mayor of Exeter to the church of St\r\n    Peter’s.\r\n\r\nThese officers of the municipality discharged their duties, says the\r\nElizabethan writer, “as of old;” from which we may conclude that some such\r\nregulation had existed from quite early times. The scavengers are\r\nmentioned by Stow at the end of his account of each City ward along with\r\nother officers. We have already seen, from the court rolls of the manor of\r\nCastle Combe under the year 1427, that villagers were fined or admonished\r\nfor creating nuisances. A sudden revival of zeal in that way at Castle\r\nCombe in the year 1590 may have been due to the vigorous sanitary policy\r\nof Elizabeth’s government:\r\n\r\n    “And that the inhabitants of the West Strete doe remove the donge or\r\n    fylth at John Davis house ende before the feaste of Seynct Andrew\r\n    th’apostell next, and that they lay no more there within x foote of\r\n    the wey, sub poena iii s iiii d.\r\n\r\n    “And that none shall lay any duste or any other fylth in the wey or\r\n    pitte belowe Cristopher Besas house, sub poena pro quolibet tempore\r\n    xii d.\r\n\r\n    “And that none shall soyle in the church yerde nor in any of our\r\n    stretes, for every defaulte to lose xii d.\r\n\r\n    “And that the glover shall not washe any skynes, nor cast any other\r\n    fylth or soyle in the water runnynge by his house, sub poena x\r\n    s[630].”\r\n\r\nThere is an interval of a century and a half between the two instances of\r\nsanitary vigour adduced from the Castle Combe manor court; but there is no\r\nreason to believe that the tradition of common cleanliness ever lapsed\r\naltogether, in that or in any other village or town of the country.\r\n\r\nSome part of the rather unfair opinion as to the foulness of English life\r\nin former times may be traced to a well-known letter by Erasmus to the\r\nphysician of cardinal Wolsey. There are grounds for believing that Erasmus\r\nmust have judged from somewhat unfavourable instances.\r\n\r\n“We read of a city,” says Erasmus, “which was freed from continual\r\npestilence by changes made in its buildings on the advice of a\r\nphilosopher. Unless I am mistaken, England may be freed in like manner.”\r\nHe then proceeds to go over the defects of English houses, and to suggest\r\nimprovements. The houses were built with too little regard to the aspect\r\nof their doors and windows towards the sun. Again, they have a great part\r\nof their walls filled with panes of glass, admitting light in such wise as\r\nto keep out the wind, and yet letting in at chinks of the windows the air\r\nas if strained or percolated, and so much the more pestilential by being\r\nlong stagnant. These defects he would remedy by having two or three sides\r\nof a house exposed to the sky, and all glazed windows so made that they\r\nshould open wholly or shut wholly, and so shut that there might be no\r\naccess of noxious winds through gaping seams; for if it be sometimes\r\nwholesome to admit the air, it is sometimes wholesome to keep it out.\r\nInside the houses Erasmus professes to have seen a shocking state of\r\nthings--the floors covered with rushes piled, the new upon the old, for\r\ntwenty years without a clearance, befouled with all manner of filth, with\r\nspillings of beer and the remains of fish, with expectoration and vomit,\r\nwith excrement and urine[631]. Here we have clearly to do with the\r\nintelligent foreigner. On the other hand, as far back as the reign of\r\nRichard I., Englishmen would appear to have contrasted their own personal\r\nhabits with those of other nations, much as the summer tourist does now.\r\nEnglish youths, it has been said, go through Europe with one phrase on\r\ntheir lips: “Foreigners don’t wash.” Richard of Devizes implies somewhat\r\nthe same. A Frankish youth is being advised where to settle in England,\r\nWinchester being chosen by excluding the other towns one by one. Bristol,\r\nfor example, was wholly given over to soap-boilers: everyone in Bristol\r\nwas either a soap-boiler or a retired soap-boiler; “and the Franks love\r\nsoap as much as they love scavengers[632].” We may cry quits, then, with\r\nErasmus over the rush-strewn floors. It is clear, also, that the glazed\r\nfronts of English houses, which he took exception to, are the very feature\r\nof them that Sir Thomas More prided himself upon; in that as in other\r\nexternal things the London of his day seemed to him to leave little to be\r\ndesired as the capital of Utopia, his chief subjects of remark being the\r\nshambles and the want of hospitals for the sick[633].\r\n\r\nThus, when we attempt to clear the sense of our rather mixed notions on\r\nthe unwholesome life of former times, we must feel constrained to withdraw\r\na great part of the accusation as to nuisances tolerated or scavenging\r\nneglected. Most of all was the government of Elizabeth marked by vigour in\r\nits attempts to restrain plague, not only by quarantine measures, but also\r\nby radical sanitation.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth and her Council were baffled by the persistence of plague\r\nin London in 1581-82-83; the infection pursued its own course despite all\r\nefforts to “stamp it out,” so that the letters from the lords of the\r\nCouncil to the mayor begin to assume a somewhat querulous and impatient\r\ntone[634]. To a letter of remonstrance, 21st September, 1581, the mayor\r\nreplied next day that every precaution had been taken. On the 22nd March,\r\n1582, the mayor retorted upon the Court that an artificer in leather,\r\ndwelling near Fleet Bridge, had the plague in his house, that his house\r\nhad been shut up, and he restrained from going out; nevertheless he had\r\naccess to the Court in the things of his art, both for the queen and her\r\nhousehold. On the 1st September, 1582, the plague having greatly increased\r\nas appeared by certificate of the number of the dead during the last week,\r\nthe Privy Council informed the mayor that this was in part “by negligence\r\nin not keeping the streets and other places about the city clean, and\r\npartly through not shutting up of the houses where the sickness had been\r\nfound, and setting marks upon the doors; but principally through not\r\nobserving orders for prevention of the infection heretofore sent to them\r\nby the Council.” The mayor sent answer the same day that every care had\r\nbeen taken: the streets had been cleansed every other day; the parish\r\nclerks had been appointed to see to the shutting up of infected houses,\r\nand putting papers upon the doors; he had also appointed some of his own\r\nofficers to go up and down the city to view and inform him whether these\r\nthings had been done.\r\n\r\nSo much did the Council believe, or affect to believe, that the mayor\r\ncould control the plague if he carried out their orders, that they used\r\nthe adjournment of the law courts as a threat to the city. On the 15th\r\nOctober, the Term was announced to be held at Hertford, and all persons\r\nfrom infected London houses were forbidden to repair thither with\r\nmerchandise, victual, &c.[635]. Then follow in January, 1583, letters\r\ntouching an impracticable attempt of the Privy Council to have a list\r\nprinted of all inns and taverns that had been infected within the last two\r\nmonths. The mayor made a catalogue which was pronounced too long. On 21st\r\nApril, 1583, the infection had much increased, and the lords of the\r\nCouncil again urged upon the mayor to have infected houses shut up, and\r\nprovision made for feeding and maintaining the inmates thereof. They\r\ndesired to express her majesty’s surprise that no house or hospital had\r\nbeen built without the city, in some remote place, to which the infected\r\npeople might be removed, although other cities of less antiquity, fame,\r\nwealth, and reputation had provided themselves with such places, whereby\r\nthe lives of the inhabitants had been in all times of infection chiefly\r\npreserved. The mayor, on 3rd May, wrote that the Court of Aldermen had\r\npublished orders for the stay of the plague; but that they were\r\ncomparatively powerless so long as crowds of the worst sort of people\r\nresorted to see plays, bear-baiting, fencers, and profane spectacles at\r\nthe theatre, and Curtain, and other the like places.\r\n\r\nThe plague pursued its own course, wholly unaffected, so far as one can\r\nsee, by everything that was tried. One thing that was not touched by the\r\nsanitary policy, was probably more relevant than all else to the\r\ncontinuance of plague--the disposal of the dead. The theoretical\r\nimportance attached to that as an original cause of plague has been avowed\r\nin the chapter on the Black Death. We have here to see how the theory of\r\nit as a favouring thing for the continuance of the infection squares with\r\nthe facts in such a city as London under the Plantagenets and Tudors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Disposal of the Dead.\r\n\r\nIntramural interment was one of the most cherished practices of\r\nChristendom so long as the word “intramural” had a literal meaning. Hence\r\nthe correctness of the imagery used of the Spiritual City:\r\n\r\n  “To work and watch, until we lie\r\n   At rest within thy wall.”\r\n\r\nProbably each of the one hundred and twenty small parish churches of\r\nLondon in the medieval period stood in its small churchyard. In an\r\nexceptional time like the Black Death, these proved insufficient for the\r\ndaily burials: three new cemeteries were enclosed and consecrated outside\r\nthe walls--two of them in Smithfield and the other at Aldgate. These all\r\nsoon passed into the hands of friars, and became the grounds of\r\nmonasteries. The churches or churchyards of monasteries were in great\r\nrequest for burial, but not for common burials, or for burials in a time\r\nof epidemic. The ‘Vision of Piers the Ploughman’ is clear enough that the\r\nfriars took no large view of their duties; they affected the care of the\r\ndead, but only if they were well paid:\r\n\r\n    “For I said I nold | be buried at their house but at my parish church.\r\n    | For I heard once how conscience it told | that where a man was\r\n    christened by kynde [nature] he should be buried, | or where he were\r\n    parishen, right there he should be graven. | And for I said this to\r\n    friar, a fool they me held | and loved me the less for my lele speech\r\n    | ... I have much marveil of you and so hath many another | why your\r\n    convent coveteth to confess and to bury | rather than to baptise\r\n    bairns that ben catechumens.”\r\n\r\nThe reason why the friars paid so much attention to burials was that these\r\nrites were the most profitable:\r\n\r\n    “And how that freris [friars] folowed folke that was riche | and folke\r\n    that was pore at litel price they sette, | and no corps in their\r\n    kirk-yerde ne in their kyrke was buried | but quick he bequeath them\r\n    aught or should help quit their debts.”\r\n\r\nThe friars in the towns would appear, then, to have been as much in\r\nrequest for the disposal of the dead within their precincts as the monks\r\nwere in the country, both alike taking a certain part of that duty out of\r\nthe hands of the regular parish clergy. Hence we may assign a good many\r\nburials, perhaps mostly of the richer class, as in Stow’s long lists of\r\nconventual burials, to the various precincts of Whitefriars, Blackfriars,\r\nGreyfriars (within Newgate) or Friars Minor (Minories), Carthusians, or\r\nother settlements of the religious orders in the city and liberties of\r\nLondon. It is not unlikely that the narrow spaces for burial in and around\r\nthe old churches in the streets and lanes of the city were already getting\r\ncrowded, and that the friars naturally acquired a large share of the\r\nbusiness of burial because their consecrated houses and enclosed grounds\r\nwere situated where there was most room, namely in the skirt of the\r\nLiberties, or in waste spaces within the walls.\r\n\r\nThe parish churchyards within the walls became insufficient, not merely\r\nbecause of the generations of the dead, but because they were encroached\r\nupon. In 1465 the churchyard of St Mary le Bow in Cheapside was so\r\nencroached upon by building of houses that John Rotham or Rodham, citizen\r\nand tailor, by his will gave to the parson and churchwardens a certain\r\ngarden in Hosier-lane to be a churchyard; which, says Stow, so continued\r\nnear a hundred years, but now is built on and is a private man’s\r\nhouse[636]. In like manner there was a colony of Brabant weavers settled\r\nin the churchyard of St Mary Somerset, and the great house of the earl of\r\nOxford stood in St Swithin’s churchyard, near London Stone. John Stow’s\r\ngrandfather directed that his body should be buried “in the little green\r\nchurchyard of the parish church of St Michael in Cornhill, between the\r\ncross and the church wall, as nigh the wall as may be.” For some years\r\nprevious to 1582, as many as 23 of the city parishes were using St Paul’s\r\nchurchyard for their dead, having parted with their own burial grounds.\r\nBut in that year (letter of 3 April, 1582[637]) the number of parishes\r\nprivileged to use St Paul’s churchyard was reduced to 13, the ten\r\nrestrained parishes being provided for in the cemetery gifted to the city\r\nin 1569 by Sir Thomas Roe, outside Bishopsgate, “for the ease of such\r\nparishes in London as wanted ground convenient within the parishes.” The\r\nstate of St Paul’s churchyard may be imagined from the words of a\r\nremonstrance made two years after, in 1584: “The burials are so many, and\r\nby reason of former burials so shallow, that scarcely any grave could be\r\nmade without corpses being laid open[638].” Twenty years before, in 1564,\r\nor the year after the last great plague which we have dealt with, Medicus,\r\none of the speakers in Bullein’s _Dialogue of the Fever Pestilence_ brings\r\nin “the multitude of graves in every churchyard, and great heaps of rotten\r\nbones, whom we know not of what degree they were, rich or poor, in their\r\nlives.”\r\n\r\nSt Paul’s churchyard would appear to have received the dead of various\r\nparishes from an early date. There was a large charnel house for the bones\r\nof the dead on the north side, with a chapel over it, dedicated to the\r\nVirgin and endowed in 1282. Stow says that the chapel was pulled down in\r\n1549, and that “the bones of the dead, couched up in a charnel under the\r\nchapel, were conveyed from thence into Finsbury field, by report of him\r\nwho paid for the carriage, amounting to more than one thousand cart-loads,\r\nand there laid on a moorish ground, in short space after raised, by\r\nsoilage of the city upon them, to bear three windmills. The chapel and\r\ncharnel were converted into dwelling-houses, warehouses, and sheds before\r\nthem, for stationers, in place of the tombs.” Elsewhere he names Reyne\r\nWolfe, stationer, as the person who paid for the carriage of the bones and\r\n“who told me of some thousands of carry-loads, and more to be conveyed.”\r\nFrom this we may infer that the graves were systematically emptied as each\r\nnew corpse came to be buried, according to the principle of a “short\r\ntenancy of the soil” which is being re-advocated at the end of the 19th\r\ncentury by the Church of England Burial Reform Association.\r\n\r\nThe spaces reserved for burial around the newer parish churches in the\r\nliberties, such as St Sepulchre’s and St Giles’s, Cripplegate, were\r\ngradually pared down and let out for buildings by the parish. Stow, in his\r\n_Survey_ of 1598, says that St Sepulchre’s church stands “in a fair\r\nchurchyard, although not so large as of old time, for the same is letten\r\nout for buildings and a garden plot.” The records of St Giles’s,\r\nCripplegate, show that rents were received by the parish for detached\r\nportions of the churchyard in 1648[639].\r\n\r\nTo take an instance of new city graveyards still remaining: The old\r\nfifteenth-century parishes of St Ewin and St Nicholas in the Flesh\r\nShambles became united in the parish of Christ Church within Newgate,\r\nwhich, under that name, buried many, as we may read in Stow’s _Survey_. At\r\nlength its burial ground was full, and it acquired a not very large plot\r\nnext to the churchyard of St Botolph’s outside Aldersgate. Its neighbour\r\nparish within the walls, St Leonard’s in Foster Lane, acquired the next\r\nconterminous plot for its new burial-ground. All three graveyards are now\r\nthrown into one strip of public garden by the removal of the two cross\r\nwalls which originally kept the ground of each parish separate.\r\n\r\nWhile the graveyards were thus curtailed, and dwelling-houses built close\r\nup to them, the mode of burial was none of the safest. To take the\r\ninstance of the great Cripplegate parish again: some few, like John\r\nMilton, would be buried within the church in leaden coffins; others would\r\nbe laid in the ground of the churchyard in the same way, full burial dues\r\nbeing paid; but many more, for whom the dues were remitted, would be\r\nburied in a sheet, with no coffin at all, in the part of the churchyard\r\nreserved for the poor[640]. For the parish of St Saviour’s, Southwark, the\r\nscale of burial dues was as follows: “In any churchyard next the church,\r\nwith a coffin, 2_s._ 8_d._; without a coffin, 20_d._; for a child with a\r\ncoffin, 8_d._; without a coffin, 4_d._ The colledge churchyard, with a\r\ncoffin, 12_d._; without a coffin, 8_d._” One of their broadsheets, dated\r\n1580, has a picture of a body ready for burial in a cerecloth, a close\r\nfitting covering tied at the head and feet, and neatly finished[641].\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that no voices were raised against the\r\novercrowding of the old city churchyards. Intramural burial is one of the\r\nmany practical topics in Latimer’s sermons: in 1552 he denounced the state\r\nof St Paul’s churchyard as an occasion of “much sickness and disease,”\r\nappealing to its notorious smells; the citizens of Nain, he said, “had a\r\ngood and laudable custom to bury their corses without the city, which\r\nensample we may follow[642].” Preaching at Paul’s Cross on the 8th of\r\nAugust, 1563, when the plague was already destroying at the rate of five\r\nhundred in a week, Turner, commonly called Turner of Boulogne, made two\r\nsolemn petitions to my lord mayor of London: the one was that the dead of\r\nthe city should be buried out of the city in the field; the other was that\r\nno bell should be tolled for them when they lay at the mercy of God\r\ndeparting out of this present life, “for that the tolling of the bell did\r\nthe party departing no good, neither afore their death nor after[643].” In\r\nthe writings on plague, putrefying animal matters, such as carrion or\r\noffal, are always mentioned among the causes; but it is only rarely that\r\nthe ordinary burial of the dead is referred to. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the filling of the soil with products of cadaveric decomposition\r\nplayed a greater part in the theory of plague, especially in the writings\r\nof Prosper Alpinus, physician to the Venetian consulate at Cairo. Among\r\nEnglish books, the treatise on Plague by Dr Gilbert Skene, of Edinburgh\r\n(1568), is the only one that is at all clear upon the point. In his fourth\r\nchapter, on the places which be most pestilential, he includes the\r\nlocalities “where many dead are buried,” the ground there becoming “fat\r\nand vaporative;” and in his first chapter, on causes in general, he\r\ninstances “dead carrions unburied, in special of mankind, which, by\r\nsimilitude of nature, is most nocent to man, as every brutal is most\r\ninfectant and pestilential to their own kind.” But even if these truths\r\nhad been generally apprehended, religious prescription and usage would\r\nhave been too strong to allow of radical measures being adopted. The grand\r\nprovocative of plague was no obvious nuisance above ground, but the\r\nloading of the soil, generation after generation, with an immense\r\nquantity of cadaveric matters, which were diffused in the pores of the\r\nground under the feet of the living, to rise in emanations, more deadly in\r\none season than in another, according as the level of the ground-water and\r\nthe heat of the earth determined the degree of oxidation, or the formation\r\nof the more dangerous half-way products of decomposition.\r\n\r\nSo little is known of the great plagues of London in 1406-7, 1464, 1479,\r\n1500, and 1513, that we can only conjecture how the dead, to the number\r\nperhaps of one hundred in a day at the height of the epidemic, were\r\ndisposed of--probably in trenches in the fields of Whitechapel, Smithfield\r\nand Finsbury, or in such parishes as St Sepulchre’s. The skirts of the\r\ncity were used also to deposit the soil upon. Thus it happened that the\r\nground outside the walls, which came in time to be the densely populated\r\nliberties and out-parishes, and the chief seat of all later plagues, had\r\nfor generations before received the refuse of the city and a large\r\nproportion of the bodies of the dead. An instance mentioned by Stow, in\r\n1598, may be taken as standing for many more: “On the right hand, beyond\r\nShoreditch Church toward Hackney, are some late-built houses upon the\r\ncommon soil; for it was a lay-stall.”\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be said of localities and circumstances of plague in\r\nLondon will come in with the history of successive epidemics, which we may\r\nnow resume and carry to the end of the Tudor period.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology of Plague, 1564-1592.\r\n\r\nThe amount of plague in London for the two or three years next following\r\nthe great epidemic in the autumn of 1563 is accurately known from Stow’s\r\nabstracts of the weekly bills of mortality. It was exceedingly little, the\r\ndeaths being but one or two or three in a week, and often none. The\r\nfigures come to an end with July, 1566, and it is probable that the bills\r\nmay not have been made for a time after that. The proposal made by Sir\r\nRoger Martyn in a letter of 20th October, 1568, to the earl of\r\nNorthumberland, that all strangers arriving from over sea should be\r\nquarantined at Gravesend, would have been instigated by the known\r\nprevalence of plague and other malignant types of sickness in Scotland\r\nand at various parts of the continent of Europe. It was just in those\r\nyears, before and after the founding of the Royal Exchange in 1566, that\r\nthe concourse of merchants to London, especially from the war-troubled Low\r\nCountries and France, was greatest.\r\n\r\nThe revival of plague in London, after the great epidemic of 1563, was\r\nprobably in 1568. In the city records there are orders relating to\r\nsearchers, shutting up of houses, and collections for infected households,\r\ndated 12 October, 1568 (10 Elizabeth), 27 March and 19 October, 1569. But\r\nin 1568 the regulations, like the proposal for quarantine of shipping, may\r\nhave been made more against the importation of cases from outside than on\r\naccount of cases actually in London. It is in 1569 that we definitely hear\r\nof plague in the capital:--\r\n\r\n“The plague of pestilence somewhat raging in the city of London,\r\nMichaelmas Term was first adjourned unto the 3rd of November, and after\r\nunto Hillary Term next following[644].” This outbreak of the autumn and\r\nwinter of 1569 must have been considerable: for we find the earl of Essex\r\nwriting from York on the 30th October to Cecil to say that he would have\r\ncome to London before “had not the plague stayed him[645];” and Thomas\r\nBishop, giving account of his movements to the Council, says that he\r\nremained in London until the 10th October, “when the plague increasing, I\r\ndeparted[646].”\r\n\r\nThe year 1570 was one of the more disastrous plague-years on the\r\nContinent, that now recur somewhat frequently down to the end of the\r\ncentury. “There was general disease of pestilence,” says Stow, “throughout\r\nall Europe, in such sort that many died of God’s tokens, chiefly amongst\r\nthe Venetians, of whom there died of that cruel sickness about threescore\r\nthousand.” In London, on 2nd August, a death in the Tower was put down to\r\nplague; but there is no other evidence of its prevalence in the\r\ncapital[647]. In the beginning of next winter, 1571, there was plague at\r\nCambridge (letter of 18th November)[648]; and at Oxford in the same year\r\nit left such misery, says Anthony Wood, that divers scholars were forced\r\nto beg[649]. In 1573 it reappeared in London, at its usual season, the end\r\nof the year: it raged so violently “that the Queen ordered the new Lord\r\nMayor not to keep the usual feast upon his inauguration[650].” The\r\nregister of St Andrew’s parish, at Hertford, bears witness to the flight\r\nof Londoners to that favourite refuge; there were numerous burials of the\r\nplague in 1573, and in subsequent years, many of them being of London\r\ncitizens[651]. It was in London again in 1574: a letter of 15 November, to\r\nthe sheriff and justices of Surrey, orders that they should not allow the\r\npeople to resort to plays and shows [in Southwark] “at that time of\r\ncontagion[652],” while the figures from a weekly bill of mortality, which\r\nhave been preserved, show that the outbreak had been one of the more\r\nconsiderable degree--for the week 22-28 October, in the city and liberties\r\n(108 parishes), buried of all diseases, 166, whereof of the plague,\r\n65[653].\r\n\r\nThe known provincial centres in 1574 were Stamford, Peterborough and\r\nChester. The Stamford visitation was one of a good many that the town\r\nsuffered from first to last, and must have been a severe one; in one\r\nmonth, from 8 August to 7 September, 40 had been buried of the plague,\r\n“and the town is so rudely governed, they have so mixed themselves, that\r\nthere is none that is in any hope of being clear. It is in seventeen\r\nhouses, and the town is in great poverty; but that the good people of the\r\ncountry send in victuals, there would many die of famine. St Martin’s\r\nparish is clear[654].” The corporation records also bear witness to the\r\nconfusion caused, the new bailiffs having been sworn in before the\r\nRecorder in a field outside, instead of in the usual place[655].\r\nPeterborough, which was not far off, is known to have had a visitation,\r\nfrom an entry in the parish register, “1574, January. Here began the\r\nplague[656].” At Chester, “plague began, but was stayed with the death of\r\nsome few in the crofts[657].”\r\n\r\nThe year 1575 is somewhat singular for an epidemic of plague in\r\nWestminster, but none in the city of London: the deaths for one week in\r\nthe former are known[658]; and, as regards the immunity of London, Cecil\r\nhad removed previous to 16 September, from Westminster to Sir Thomas\r\nGresham’s house in the City to avoid the infection[659]. It had been at\r\nCambridge in the winter of 1574-5, and was “sore” in Oxford down to\r\nNovember, 1575.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1575, was a season of severe plague in Bristol and other\r\nplaces of the west of England. Some 2000 are said (in the Mayor’s\r\nCalendar) to have died in Bristol between St James’s tide (July 25) when\r\nthe infection “began to be very hot,” and Paul’s tide (January 25)[660].\r\nAs early as the 11th July, the corporation of Wells had ordered measures\r\nagainst the plague in Bristol; but Wells also appears to have had a\r\nvisitation, if the 200 persons buried, according to tradition, in the\r\n“plague-pit” near the north-eastern end of the Cathedral (besides many\r\nmore buried in the fields) had been victims of the disease in 1575[661].\r\nAt Shrewsbury in that year the fairs were removed on account of\r\nplague[662]. From a claim of damages which came before the Court of\r\nRequests in 1592, it appears that plague had been in Cheshire in 1576; at\r\nNorthwich the house of one Phil. Antrobus was infected and most of the\r\nfamily died; on which some linens in the house, worth not more than\r\n13_sh._ 4_d._ were put in the river lest they should be used; the son, who\r\nwas a tailor, claimed compensation, through the earl of Derby, sixteen\r\nyears after[663].\r\n\r\nAt Hull, in 1576, there was an outbreak, small compared with some other\r\nvisitations there, in the Blackfriars Gate, the deaths being about one\r\nhundred[664]. It is somewhat remarkable to find the borough of\r\nKirkcudbright making regulations in the month of January, 1577, a most\r\nunlikely season, to prevent the introduction of the plague then raging on\r\nthe Borders[665]. In September, 1577, there were issued orders to be put\r\nin execution throughout the realm in towns and villages infected with the\r\nplague. More definitely it is heard of on 21 October at Rye and Dover, and\r\non 3 November, 1577, in London.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a series of years, 1578 to 1583, for which we have full\r\nparticulars of the burials in London, from plague and other causes, and of\r\nthe christenings. These valuable statistics, the earliest known, are\r\npreserved among the papers of Lord Burghley, who procured them from the\r\nlord mayor of London[666], and are here given in full, having been copied\r\nfrom the MS. in the library of Hatfield House[667].\r\n\r\n_Abstracts of Burials and Baptisms in London, 1578-1583_\r\n\r\n  1578\r\n\r\n   Week               Of     Of other\r\n  ending

 59\r\n        31   144     40       104         73\r\n\r\nThese tables were compiled from weekly bills furnished to the Court, and\r\ndoubtless drawn up like the bills of 1532 and 1535 to show the deaths from\r\nplague and from other causes in each of the several parishes in the City,\r\nLiberties and suburbs. It is clear that the results were known from week\r\nto week, for a letter of January 29, 1578, says that the plague is\r\nincreased from 7 to 37 (? 33) deaths in three weeks. But that was not the\r\nbeginning of the epidemic in London; it was rather a lull in a\r\nplague-mortality which is known to have been severe in the end of 1577,\r\nand had led to the prohibition of stage-plays in November[668].\r\n\r\nIn that series of five plague-years in London, only two, 1578 and 1582,\r\nhad a large total of plague-deaths. The year 1580 was almost clear (128\r\ndeaths from plague), and may be taken as showing the ordinary proportion\r\nof deaths to births in London when plague did not arise to disturb it. The\r\nbaptisms, it will be observed, are considerably in excess of the burials;\r\nand as every child was christened in church under Elizabeth, we may take\r\nit that we have the births fully recorded (with the doubtful exception of\r\nstill-births and “chrisoms”). But while the one favourable year shows an\r\nexcess of some 24 per cent. of baptisms over burials, the whole period of\r\nfive years shows a shortcoming in the baptisms of 33 per cent. Thus we may\r\nsee how seriously a succession of plague-years, at the endemic level of\r\nthe disease, kept down the population; and, at the same time, how the\r\nnumbers in the capital would increase rapidly from within, in the absence\r\nof plague. There is reason to think that plague was almost or altogether\r\nabsent from London for the next nine years (1583 to 1592); and it is not\r\nsurprising to find that the population, as estimated from the births, had\r\nincreased from some 120,000 to 150,000. The increase of London population\r\nunder Elizabeth was proceeding so fast, plague or no plague, that measures\r\nwere taken in 1580 to check it. The increase of London has never depended\r\nsolely upon its own excess of births over deaths; indeed, until the\r\npresent century, there were probably few periods when such excess occurred\r\nover a series of years. Influx from the country and from abroad always\r\nkept London up to its old level of inhabitants, whatever the death-rate;\r\nand from the early part of the Tudor period caused it to grow rapidly. I\r\nshall review briefly in another chapter the stages in the growth of\r\nLondon, as it may be reckoned from bills of mortality and of baptisms. But\r\nas the proclamation of 1580, against new buildings, the first of a long\r\nseries down to the Commonwealth, has special reference to the plague in\r\nthe Liberties, and to the unwholesome condition of those poor skirts of\r\nthe walled city, this is the proper place for it:\r\n\r\n    “The Queen’s Majesty perceiving the state of the city of London and\r\n    the suburbs and confines thereof to encrease daily by access of people\r\n    to inhabit in the same, in such ample sort as thereby many\r\n    inconveniences are seen already, but many greater of necessity like to\r\n    follow ... and [having regard] to the preservation of her people in\r\n    health, which may seem impossible to continue, though presently by\r\n    God’s goodness the same is perceived to be in better estate\r\n    universally than hath been in man’s memory: yet there are such great\r\n    multitudes of people brought to inhabit in small rooms, whereof a\r\n    great part are seen very poor; yea, such must live of begging, or of\r\n    worse means; and they heaped up together, and in a sort smothered with\r\n    many families of children and servants in one house or small tenement;\r\n    it must needs follow, if any plague or popular sickness should by\r\n    God’s permission enter among those multitudes, that the same should\r\n    not only spread itself and invade the whole city and confines, as\r\n    great mortality should ensue the same, where her Majesty’s personal\r\n    presence is many times required; besides the great confluence of\r\n    people from all places of the realm by reason of the ordinary Terms\r\n    for justice there holden; but would be also dispersed through all\r\n    other parts of the realm to the manifest danger of the whole body\r\n    thereof, out of which neither her Majesty’s own person can be (but by\r\n    God’s special ordinance) exempted, nor any other, whatsoever they be.\r\n\r\n    For remedy whereof, as time may now serve until by some further good\r\n    order, to be had in Parliament or otherwise, the same may be remedied,\r\n    Her Majesty by good and deliberate advice of her Council, and being\r\n    thereto much moved by the considerate opinions of the Mayor, Aldermen\r\n    and other the grave, wise men in and about the city, doth charge and\r\n    straitly command all persons of what quality soever they be to desist\r\n    and forbear from any new buildings of any new house or tenement within\r\n    three miles of any of the gates of the said city, to serve for\r\n    habitation or lodging for any person, where no former house hath been\r\n    known to have been in memory of such as are now living. And also to\r\n    forbear from letting or setting, or suffering any more families than\r\n    one only to be placed or to inhabit from henceforth in any house that\r\n    heretofore hath been inhabited, etc.... Given at Nonesuch, the 7th of\r\n    July, 1580[669].”\r\n\r\nAmong the more special suggestions of the mayor, on the causes and\r\nprevention of plague, previous to this proclamation were[670]:\r\n\r\n    1. The avoiding of inmates in places pretending exemption.\r\n\r\n    2. The restraining of the building of small tenements and turning\r\n    great houses into small habitations by foreigners.\r\n\r\n    3. The increase of buildings in places exempt.\r\n\r\n    4. The increase of buildings about the Charterhouse, Mile End Fields;\r\n    also at St Katherine’s along the water side.\r\n\r\n    5. The pestering of exempt places with strangers and foreign\r\n    artificers.\r\n\r\n    6. The number of strangers in and about London of no church.\r\n\r\n    7. The haunting of plays out of the Liberties.\r\n\r\n    8. The killing of cattle within or near the city.\r\n\r\nThe best glimpses that we get of the plague in London in 1578 are in\r\nletters to Lord Burghley[671]. On October 22, the Recorder of London, Sir\r\nW. Fleetwood, writes to him that he “has been in Bucks since Michaelmas,\r\nbecause he was troubled every day with such as came to him having plague\r\nsores about them; and being sent by the Lords to search for lewd persons\r\nin sundry places, he found dead corses under the table, which surely did\r\ngreatly annoy him.” It will be seen by the statistics that the deaths from\r\nall causes had risen to more than three hundred in a week before\r\nMichaelmas--a small mortality compared with that of 1563, or of any other\r\nLondon epidemic of the first degree. From other letters, relating to\r\nplague at St Albans, Ware and other places near London, it may be\r\nconcluded that the citizens had escaped from London to their usual country\r\nresorts in plague-time. On August 30 there were said to be sixty cases of\r\nplague at St Albans, and on October 13 Ware is said to have been “of late”\r\ninfected. Plague-deaths are entered also in the Hertford parish registers\r\nin 1577 and 1578[672]. On 14 September the infection was in the “Bull” at\r\nHoddesdon (Herts), but the landlord refused to close his house against\r\ntravellers on their way to the Court. On Oct. 13, 1578, two deaths are\r\nreported from Queens’ College, Cambridge, “the infection being taken by\r\nthe company of a Londoner in Stourbridge Fair;” these two deaths had\r\n“moved many to depart” from the University[673]. In the same month it was\r\nat Bury St Edmunds. Earlier in the year, a letter from Truro (11 April)\r\nsays that the plague was prevalent in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1578 at Norwich was relatively a far more serious one than\r\nthat of the capital, and was traced to the visit of the queen: “the trains\r\nof her Majesty’s carriage, being many of them infected, left the plague\r\nbehind, which afterwards increased so and continued as it raged above one\r\nand three-quarter years after.” From August 20, 1578, to February 19,\r\n1579, the deaths were 4817, of which 2335 were of English and 2482 of\r\n“alyan strangers,” ten aldermen being among the victims[674]. At Yarmouth,\r\nin 1579, two thousand are said to have died of the plague between May-day\r\nand Michaelmas[675]. Colchester had plague from December, 1578 to August,\r\n1579[676]. It was at Ipswich and at Plymouth in 1579; the epidemic at the\r\nlatter must have been severe, if the estimate of 600 deaths, given in the\r\nannals of the town, is to be trusted[677]. It was again at Stamford in\r\n1580, as appears from an order of the corporation, September 7,\r\nprohibiting people from leaving the town[678]. Other centres of plague in\r\n1580 were at Rye, which was cut off from intercourse with London[679], at\r\nLeicester, where an assessment for the visited was appointed by the common\r\nhall of the citizens[680], at Gloucester, from Easter to Michaelmas, and\r\nat Hereford and Wellington, the musters in October having been hindered by\r\n“the great infection of the plague[681].”\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 1582, six houses were shut up at Dover, and on September 12\r\nthere was plague in Windsor and Eton[682]. In the parish register of\r\nCranbrooke (Kent), 18 burials are specially marked (as from plague) in\r\n1581, 41 in 1582, and 22 in 1583[683]. It was much dispersed in the Isle\r\nof Sheppey, the year after (1584) from Michaelmas into the winter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the years from the spring of 1583 to the autumn of 1592 appear to\r\nhave been unmarked by plague in London, they witnessed a good many\r\nepidemics along the east coast, and in a few places elsewhere, of which\r\nthe particulars are for the most part meagre.\r\n\r\nA casual mention is made of plague at Yarmouth in 1584[684]. The town of\r\nBoston appears to have had plague continuously for four years from 1585 to\r\n1588. In 1585 houses were shut up[685]; in 1586 a case at Southwell was\r\nsupposed to have been imported from Boston[686]; in the parish register\r\nthe burials from plague and other causes in 1587 reach the high figure of\r\n372, and in 1588 they are 200, the average for eight years before being\r\n122, and for twelve years after, only 84. In 1588 one Williams, of Holm,\r\nin Huntingdonshire, was sent for to cleanse infected houses in St John’s\r\nRow, which had been used as pest-houses[687]. Within ten miles round\r\nBoston the plague prevailed; at Leake there were 104 burials from\r\nNovember, 1587, to November, 1588, the annual average being 24; at\r\nFrampton there were 130 burials in 1586-87, the average being 30; at\r\nKirton there were 57 burials in 1589, and 102 in 1590[688].\r\n\r\nAnother centre on the east coast was Wisbech. In 1585 it appeared in the\r\nhamlet of Guyhirne. In 1586 it entered Wisbech itself, caused the usual\r\nshutting up of houses, and so increased in 1587 that there were 42 burials\r\nin September and 62 in October[689], being three or four times more than\r\naverage. It is mentioned also at Ipswich in 1585, and at Norwich in\r\n1588[690]. At Derby, in 1586, there was plague in St Peter’s parish[691].\r\nAt Chesterfield in November, 1586, there were plague-deaths, and again in\r\nMay 1587[692]. At Leominster, in 1587, there was an excessive mortality\r\n(209 burials)[693].\r\n\r\nThe other great centre on the east coast in those years was in Durham and\r\nNorthumberland[694]. In 1587 the infection began to show at Hartlepool,\r\nand in the parishes of Stranton and Hart; at the latter village 89 were\r\nburied of the plague, one of them an unknown young woman who died in the\r\nstreet. In 1589 the plague entered Newcastle and raged severely; of 340\r\ndeaths in the whole year in St John’s parish, 103 occurred in September;\r\nthe total mortality of the epidemic to the 1st January, 1590, was 1727.\r\nDurham also had a visitation in 1589, plague-huts having been erected on\r\nElvet Moor. Those were years of scarcity, the year 1586 having been one of\r\nfamine-prices.\r\n\r\nThe great event of the time was the defeat of the Spanish Armada off the\r\nFrench coast from Calais to Gravelines in the last days of July, 1588. A\r\nsoutherly gale sprang up, which drove the magnificent Spanish fleet past\r\nthe Thames as far as the Orkneys. It was perhaps well for England that the\r\nwinds parted the two fleets. The English ships, which had come to anchor\r\nin Margate Roads to guard the mouth of the Thames, were in two or three\r\nweeks utterly crippled by sickness. The disease must have been a very\r\nrapid and deadly infection. Lord Admiral Howard writes to the queen:\r\n“those that come in fresh are soonest infected; they sicken one day and\r\ndie the next.” In a previous letter to Burghley he writes: “It is a most\r\npitiful sight to see the men die in the streets of Margate. The Elizabeth\r\nJonas has lost half her crew. Of all the men brought out by Sir Richard\r\nTownsend, he has but one left alive.” The ships were so weak that they\r\ncould not venture to come through the Downs from Margate to Dover[695]. It\r\nis doubtful whether any part of this sickness and mortality was due to\r\nplague, which was not active anywhere in the south of England in that\r\nyear. Want of food and want of clothes, and in the last resort the\r\nhardness and parsimony of Elizabeth, appear to have been the causes. Lord\r\nHoward begs for £1000 worth of new clothing, as the men were in great\r\nwant, and Lord H. Seymour writes that “the men fell sick with cold.”\r\nDysentery and typhus were doubtless the infections which had been bred,\r\nand became communicable to the fresh drafts of men. But in the Spanish\r\nships, beating about on the high seas and unable to land their men or even\r\nto help each other, the sickness grew into true plague, so that the broken\r\nremnants of the Armada which reached Corunna were like so many floating\r\npest-houses.\r\n\r\nIn 1590 and 1591, at a clear interval from the Armada year, there was\r\nmuch plague in Devonshire. The evidence of its having been in Plymouth\r\ncomes solely from the corporation accounts; at various times in 1590 and\r\n1591 there were paid, “ten shillings to one that all his stuff was burned\r\nfor avoiding the sickness,” a sum of £5. 19_s._ for houses shut, and a\r\nlike sum to persons kept in, and sixteen shillings to four men “to watch\r\nthe townes end for to stay the people of the infected places[696].” The\r\nchief epidemics, however, appear to have been at Totness in 1590 and at\r\nTiverton in 1591. The parish register of Totness enters the “first of the\r\nplague, Margary, the daughter of Mr Wyche of Dartmouth, June 22, 1590,”\r\nfrom which it may be inferred that plague was first at Dartmouth, nine\r\nmiles down the river, and had ascended to Totness. The following monthly\r\nmortalities will show how severe the infection became at Totness in the\r\nsummer and autumn immediately following[697]:\r\n\r\n  July 42 (36 of plague, 6 not),\r\n  August 81 (80 of plague, 1 not),\r\n  September 39 (all of plague),\r\n  October 37 (all of plague),\r\n  November 25 (24 of plague, 1 not),\r\n  December 19 (all of plague),\r\n  January, 1591, 10 of plague,\r\n  February 1 of plague.\r\n\r\nThis heavy mortality from plague (246 deaths) was hardly over, when the\r\ninfection began in March, 1591, at Tiverton. It is said to have been\r\nintroduced by one William Waulker “a waulking man or traveller.” From 1st\r\nMarch, 1591, to 1st March, 1592, the deaths from plague and other causes\r\nwere 551, or about one in nine of the population[698].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Plague of 1592-1593.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of plague, which reached its height in the year 1593, began\r\nto be felt in London in the autumn of 1592[699], and is said to have\r\ncaused 2000 deaths before the end of the year. On the 7th September,\r\nsoldiers from the north on their way to Southampton to embark for foreign\r\nparts had to pass round London “to avoid the infection which is much\r\nspread abroad” in the city. On the 16th September, the spoil of a great\r\nSpanish carrack at Dartmouth could be brought no farther than Greenwich,\r\non account of the contagion in London; no one to go from London to\r\nDartmouth to buy the goods. It was an ominous sign that the infection\r\nlasted through the winter; even in mid winter people were leaving London:\r\n“the plague is so sore that none of worth stay about these places[700].”\r\nOn the 6th April, 1593, one William Cecil who had been kept in the Fleet\r\nprison by the queen’s command, writes that “the place where he lies is a\r\ncongregation of the unwholesome smells of the town, and the season\r\ncontagious, so many have died of the plague[701].” From a memorial of\r\n1595, it appears that the neighbourhood of Fleet Ditch had been the most\r\ninfected part of the whole city and liberties in 1593; “in the last great\r\nplague more died about there than in three parishes besides[702].” The\r\nepidemic does not appear to have reached its height until summer; on 12th\r\nJune, a letter states that “the plague is very hot in London and other\r\nplaces of the realm, so that a great mortality is expected this summer.”\r\nOn 3 July the Court “is in out places, and a great part of the household\r\ncut off [? dispensed with].” The infection is mentioned in letters down to\r\nNovember, after which date its public interest, at least, appears to have\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nOf that London epidemic a weekly record was kept by the Company of Parish\r\nClerks, and published by them, beginning with the weekly bill of 21st\r\nDecember, 1592. The clerk of the Company of Parish Clerks, writing in\r\n1665, had the annual bill for 1593 before him, with the plague-deaths and\r\nother deaths in each of 109 parishes in alphabetical order, and the\r\nchristenings as well[703]. For the next two years, 1594 and 1595, he\r\nappears to have had before him not only the annual bills but also a\r\ncomplete set of the weekly bills of burials and christenings according to\r\nparishes. The same documents were used by Graunt in 1662, and had\r\ndoubtless been used by John Stow at the time when they were published. The\r\noriginals are all lost, and only a few totals extracted from them remain\r\non record. To begin with Stow’s. The mortality of 17,844 from all causes\r\nin 1593 is given as for the City and Liberties only. But there was already\r\na considerable population in the parishes immediately beyond the Bars of\r\nthe Liberties, which were known as the nine out-parishes, namely those of\r\nSt Clement Danes, St Giles in the Fields, St James, Clerkenwell, St\r\nKatharine at the Tower, St Leonard, Shoreditch, St Martin in the Fields,\r\nSt Mary, Whitechapel, St Magdalen, Bermondsey, and the Savoy. Besides\r\nthese there were important parishes still farther out--the Westminster\r\nparishes, Lambeth, Newington, Stepney, Hackney and Islington. Of these,\r\nWhitechapel, Stepney, Shoreditch, Clerkenwell and some of the western\r\nparishes contributed largely to the plague-bills of the epidemics next\r\nfollowing, in 1603 and 1625, and it is known from the parish registers of\r\nsome of them that they contributed to the mortality of 1593. It is\r\nprobably to these parishes that we should ascribe the difference between\r\nthe above total of 17,844 (for City and Liberties) and the much larger\r\ntotal of deaths “in and about London,” given on the margin of a broadside\r\nof 1603: “And in the last visitation from the 20th of December, 1592 to\r\nthe 23rd of the same month in the year 1593, died in all 25,886--of the\r\nplague in and about London 15,003.” The addition for the parishes beyond\r\nthe Bars would thus be 8,042 deaths from all causes, and from plague\r\nalone 4,541--numbers which will seem not inadmissible if they be compared\r\nwith the figures for the corresponding parishes ten years after, in 1603,\r\nStepney alone having had 2,257 deaths in that plague-year[704].\r\n\r\nFor the two years next following 1593, Graunt’s book of 1662 has preserved\r\nthe totals of deaths from all causes and from plague in the 97 old\r\nparishes within the walls and in 16 parishes of the Liberties and suburbs;\r\nhe has omitted the christenings, although he had the figures before him.\r\nTaking these along with the figures already given for 1593, we get the\r\nfollowing table for three consecutive years:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------\r\n       | Plague | Other  | Total  |\r\n  Year | deaths | deaths | deaths | Christenings\r\n  -----|--------|--------|--------|-------------\r\n  1593 | 10,662 |  7,182 | 17,844 |   4,021\r\n  1594 |    421 |  3,508 |  3,929 |     --\r\n  1595 |     29 |  3,478 |  3,507 |     --\r\n  ----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe proportion of mortality in 1593 that fell to the old area within the\r\nwalls is known, from Stow’s abstract of the figures, to have been about\r\nthe same as in the space of the Liberties (8598 in the one, 9295 in the\r\nother), the deaths from other causes than plague having been rather more\r\nin the latter than within the walls. Probably the population in the\r\nLiberties was about equal to that in the City proper, the acreage being\r\nrather less in the former, but the crowding, doubtless, greater.\r\n\r\nThe London plague of 1592-93 called forth two known publications, an\r\nanonymous ‘Good Councell against the Plague, showing sundry preservatives\r\n... to avoyde the infection lately begun in some places of this Cittie’\r\n(London, 1592), and the ‘Defensative’ of Simon Kellwaye (April, 1593). The\r\ndates of these two books show that the alarm had really begun in the end\r\nof 1592 and early months of 1593. Kellwaye’s book is mostly an echo of\r\nforeign writings, the only part of it with direct interest for English\r\npractice being the 11th chapter, which “teacheth what orders magistrates\r\nand rulers of Citties and townes shoulde cause to be observed.” As that\r\nchapter sums up the various Elizabethan and other orders, and constitutes\r\na short epitome of sanitary practice, I append it in full:\r\n\r\n    “Teacheth what orders magistrates and rulers of Citties and townes\r\n    shoulde cause to be observed.\r\n\r\n    1. First to command that no stinking doonghills be suffered neere the\r\n    Cittie.\r\n\r\n    2. Every evening and morning in the hot weather to cause colde water\r\n    to be cast in the streetes, especially where the infection is, and\r\n    every day to cause the streets to be kept cleane and sweete, and\r\n    clensed from all filthie thinges which lye in the same.\r\n\r\n    3. And whereas the infection is entred, there to cause fires to be\r\n    made in the streetes every morning and evening, and if some\r\n    frankincense, pitch or some other sweet thing be burnt therein it will\r\n    be much the better.\r\n\r\n    4. Suffer not any dogs, cattes, or pigs to run about the streets, for\r\n    they are very dangerous, and apt to carry the infection from place to\r\n    place.\r\n\r\n    5. Command that the excrements and filthy things which are voided from\r\n    the infected places be not cast into the streets, or rivers which are\r\n    daily in use to make drink or dress meat.\r\n\r\n    6. That no Chirurgions, or barbers, which use to let blood, do cast\r\n    the same into the streets or rivers.\r\n\r\n    7. That no vautes or previes be then emptied, for it is a most\r\n    dangerous thing.\r\n\r\n    8. That all Inholders do every day make clean their stables, and cause\r\n    the doong and filth therein to be carryed away out of the Cittie; for,\r\n    by suffering it in their houses, as some do use to do, a whole week or\r\n    fortnight, it doth so putrifie that when it is removed, there is such\r\n    a stinking savour and unwholesome smell, as is able to infect the\r\n    whole street where it is.\r\n\r\n    9. To command that no hemp or flax be kept in water neere the Cittie\r\n    or towne, for that will cause a very dangerous and infectious savour.\r\n\r\n    10. To have a speciall care that good and wholesome victuals and corne\r\n    be solde in the markets, and so to provide that no want thereof be in\r\n    the Cittie, and for such as have not wherewithall to buy necessary\r\n    food, that there to extend their charitable and goodly devotion; for\r\n    there is nothing that will more encrease the plague than want and\r\n    scarcity of necessary food.\r\n\r\n    11. To command that all those which do visit and attend the sick, as\r\n    also all those which have the sickness on them, and do walk abroad:\r\n    that they do carry something in their hands, thereby to be known from\r\n    other people.\r\n\r\n    Lastly, if the infection be in but few places, there to keep all the\r\n    people in their houses, all necessaries being brought to them. When\r\n    the plague is staid, then to cause all the clothes, bedding, and other\r\n    such things as were used about the sick to be burned, although at the\r\n    charge of the rest of the inhabitants you buy them all new.”\r\n\r\nThe letters of the time give us a glimpse of this plague in London. On\r\nNovember 3, 1593, Richard Stapes writes to Dr Cæsar, judge of the\r\nAdmiralty Court, residing at St Albans (doubtless to escape the\r\ninfection): “My next door neighbour and tenant on Sunday last buried his\r\nservant of the plague, and since, on the other side of me, my son-in-law\r\nhas buried his servant; but I cannot say his was the sickness because the\r\nvisitors reported that the tokens did not appear on him as on the\r\nother[705].”\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1592-93 continued in London at a low level into the year\r\n1594, when 421 persons died of the plague in the City and Liberties. Next\r\nyear the plague-deaths had fallen to 29. Watford and Hertford, two of the\r\nmost usual resorts of Londoners in a sickly season, were infected by\r\nplague from 1592 to 1594, many of the deaths being of refugees from the\r\ncapital. At Watford there were 124 burials in the first eight months of\r\n1594, a number much above the average, and many of them marked in the\r\nregister as plague-deaths[706]. At Hertford plague-deaths appear in the\r\nregisters of All Saints and St Andrew’s parishes in 1592 and 1594. But the\r\ngreatest mortality at Hertford was in 1596; in St Andrew’s parish there\r\nwere 13 burials in March, the average being one or two in the month; the\r\nmortality declined until July, in which month there were buried, among\r\nothers, between the 12th and 26th, five children of one of the chief\r\nburgesses (mayor in 1603)[707]. These may or may not have been\r\nplague-deaths, the year 1596 having been unhealthy, as we shall see, with\r\nother types of sickness.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in several provincial towns at a greater distance from the\r\ncapital than the summer resorts in Hertfordshire, there was plague in the\r\nend of 1592, at the same time as in London, and in the following years. At\r\nDerby, “the great plague and mortality” began in All Saints parish and in\r\nSt Alkmund’s, at Martinmas, 1592, and ended at Martinmas, 1593, stopping\r\nsuddenly, “past all expectation of man, what time it was dispersed in\r\nevery corner of this whole parish, not two houses together being free from\r\nit[708].” At Lichfield in 1593 and 1594 upwards of 1100 are said to have\r\ndied of the plague[709]. At Leicester, on the 21st September, 1593, a\r\ncontribution was levied for the plague-stricken[710]. At Shrewsbury in\r\n1592-3 there was either plague itself or alarms of it[711]; in the parish\r\nof Bishop’s Castle there was the enormous mortality of 135 in July and\r\nAugust, 1593, and 182 burials for the year, the average being 25[712]. In\r\nthe same years the infection was in Canterbury, as appears from entries of\r\npayments “to Goodman Ledes watchying at Anthony Howes dore ... when his\r\nhouse was first infected with the plague,” and, the year after, “to those\r\nii pore folkes which were appointed to carry such to burial as died of the\r\nplague; and also to the woman that was appointed to sock them[713].” There\r\nare also various references to houses visited and to poor persons\r\nrelieved. Nottingham and Lincoln are also mentioned as having been\r\nnotoriously afflicted with plague in 1593[714].\r\n\r\nA solitary record of plague comes from Cornwall in 1595. On 3rd May a\r\nletter from the justices at Tregony to the Privy Council states that the\r\ninhabitants, having been charged by the justices at the General Sessions\r\nto restrain divers infected houses within the borough, were molested in\r\nexecuting these commands, and had made complaint thereof[715].\r\n\r\nAll that remains to be said of plague in England until the end of the\r\nTudor period (1603) relates exclusively to the provinces; unless the\r\nrecords are defective, London was clear of plague for nine years following\r\n1592-94, just as it was clear for nine years preceding. The year 1597 was\r\none of great scarcity in more than one region of England. At Bristol wheat\r\nis quoted at the incredible figure of twenty shillings the bushel; a civic\r\nordinance was made that every person of ability should keep in his house\r\nas many poor persons as his income would allow[716]. But it is from the\r\nNorth of England in 1597 that we have more particular accounts of famine\r\nand of plague in its train. Writing in January, 1597, the dean of Durham\r\nsays[717]:\r\n\r\n    “Want and waste have crept into Northumberland, Westmoreland and\r\n    Cumberland; many have come 60 miles from Carlisle to Durham to buy\r\n    bread, and sometimes for 20 miles there will be no inhabitant. In the\r\n    bishopric of Durham, 500 ploughs have decayed in a few years, and corn\r\n    has to be fetched from Newcastle, whereby the plague is spread in the\r\n    northern counties: tenants cannot pay their rents; then whole families\r\n    are turned out, and poor boroughs are pestered with four or five\r\n    families under one roof.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, 1597, he wrote again: “In Northumberland great\r\nvillages are depeopled, and there is no way to stop the enemy’s attempt;\r\nthe people are driven to the poor port towns.” On the 26th of May, the\r\ndean again complains that there is great dearth in Durham; some days 500\r\nhorses are at Newcastle for foreign corn, although that town and Gateshead\r\nare dangerously infected. On the 17th September, Lord Burghley, minister\r\nof State, is informed that the plague increases at Newcastle, so that the\r\nCommissioners cannot yet come thither (the Assizes were not held at all on\r\naccount of plague about Newcastle and Durham): foreign traders were\r\nselling corn at a high price, until some members of the town council\r\nproduced a stock of corn for sale at a shilling a bushel less[718]. There\r\nare no figures extant of the plague-mortality at Newcastle in 1597; but at\r\nDarlington the deaths up to October 17 were 340; and in Durham, up to\r\nOctober 27, more than 400 in Elvet, 100 in St Nicholas, 200 in St\r\nMargaret’s, 60 in St Giles’s, 60 in St Mary’s, North Bailey, and 24 in the\r\ngaol. The whole mortality in St Nicholas parish from July 11 to November\r\n27 was 215. Many of the burials were on the moor. The infection broke out\r\nagain at Darlington and Durham in September, 1598[719].\r\n\r\nCoincident with this severe plague on the eastern side, there was an\r\nequally disastrous plague in the North Riding of Yorkshire and in\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland. The plague began at Richmond in the autumn of\r\n1597. In August there were 23 deaths, and in September 42 deaths. The\r\nepidemic appears to have reached its height in the summer of 1598, the\r\ndeaths in May having been 93, in June 99, in July 182 and in August 194.\r\nThese figures indicate a grievous calamity in so small a place as\r\nRichmond. The outbreak which began on the 17th August, 1597, was over in\r\nDecember, 1598. The stress of the epidemic is shown by the fact that the\r\nchurchyard was insufficient for the burials, many of the dead having been\r\nburied in the Castle Yard and in Clarke’s Green[720]. Of this severe\r\nplague in Cumberland and Westmoreland there are few exact particulars.\r\nAccording to an inscription at Penrith Church, “on the north outside of\r\nthe vestry, in the wall, in rude characters[721],” the deaths in 1598\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n  At Penrith 2260,\r\n  \"  Kendal 2500,\r\n  \"  Richmond 2200,\r\n  \"  Carlisle 1196.\r\n\r\nWe are able to measure the accuracy of these round totals by the monthly\r\nburials for Richmond given above; the months of July and August, 1598,\r\nwith 182 and 194 deaths respectively, were the most deadly season; and it\r\nis hardly conceivable that there had been as many as 1800 deaths at\r\nRichmond in the months when the epidemic was rising to a height and\r\ndeclining therefrom according to its usual curve of intensity.\r\n\r\nAgain, the parish register of Penrith gives only 583 deaths from the\r\ninfection, the inscription on the church wall making them 2260. Perhaps\r\nthe discrepancy is to be explained by including the mortality in the\r\nvarious parishes of which Richmond, Penrith, Kendal and Carlisle were\r\nrespectively the centres and market-towns. Thus at Kirkoswald there were\r\nburied, according to the parish register, 42 of the pestilence in 1597,\r\nand no fewer than 583 in 1598[722],--a number which, if correct, means a\r\ndeath-rate comparable to that of the Black Death itself. Again, in the\r\nsmall parish of Edenhall, 42 were buried of the pestilence in 1598[723].\r\nAppleby, also, is known to have had a severe visitation[724], and so had\r\nprobably many other parishes.\r\n\r\nThe Tudor period of plague closes with a severe epidemic at Stamford,\r\nwhich began in the end of 1602. On December 2 the corporation resolved to\r\nbuild a cabin for the plague-stricken, and in January following they\r\nlevied a fourth part of a fifteenth for the relief and maintenance of\r\npeople visited with the plague. This epidemic is said to have carried off\r\nnearly 600; the parish registers of St George’s and St Michael’s contain\r\nentries of persons “buried at the cabbin of the White Fryers[725].”\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in Scotland, 1495-1603.\r\n\r\nThe history of plague in Scotland subsequent to the medieval period is of\r\ninterest chiefly as affording early illustrations of the practice of\r\nquarantine. We last saw the disease prevailing in or near Edinburgh in\r\n1475, the island of Inchkeith, in the Firth of Forth, being used as a\r\nquarantine station. It was doubtless the possession of convenient islands\r\nnear the capital--Inch Colm and Inch Garvie were both used for the same\r\npurpose afterwards--that led the Scots government to follow the example of\r\nVenice and other foreign cities at no long interval of time. When we next\r\nhear of plague in Scotland it is again in connexion with infected persons\r\non the island of Inchkeith and in the town of Leith, some time between\r\n13th August, 1495, and 4th July, 1496[726].\r\n\r\nBut these quarantine practices were not confined to the Firth of Forth. On\r\nthe 17th May, 1498, the town of Aberdeen was warned by proclamation of the\r\nbell of certain measures to be taken so as to preserve the town from the\r\npestilence “and strange sickness abefore,” the principal precaution being\r\na guard of citizens at each of the four gates during the day, and that the\r\ngates be “lockit with lokis and keis” at night. The “strange sickness\r\nabefore” is doubtless the other invasion (of syphilis) which the aldermen\r\ntried to check by an order of April, 1497; but “the pestilence” in the\r\norder of May 1498 must have been the plague itself[727]. Nothing more is\r\nheard of it at Aberdeen or elsewhere in Scotland in that year. It appears\r\nto have been somewhat general in Scotland in 1499 and 1500. The audit of\r\nburgh accounts, mostly held in June, 1499, was postponed to January 1500\r\nin some cases, the bailie of North Berwick explaining that he was\r\nprevented by the plague from coming to the Exchequer[728]. An extra\r\nallowance is made to the comptroller, Sir Patrick Hume, in March 1500,\r\n“for his great labour in collecting fermes in different parts of the\r\nkingdom in time of the infection of the plague.” At Peebles, hides and\r\nwoolfells were destroyed during the plague of 1499. There was a renewal of\r\nit in 1500, the audit being again delayed until November. The custumar of\r\nAberdeen brings his account of the great customs of that burgh down only\r\nto the 3rd July, 1500, “because after that date the accountant, from dread\r\nof the plague, did not enter the burgh of Aberdeen[729].”\r\n\r\nIt is from the same northern city that our information on plague in\r\nScotland comes exclusively for the next forty-five years, not, of course,\r\nbecause its experience was singular, but because its borough records are\r\nknown[730].\r\n\r\nOn the 24th April, 1514, various orders were made at Aberdeen against a\r\ndisease that seems to have been the plague: “for keeping of the town from\r\nstrange sickness, and specially this contagious pestilence ringand in all\r\nparts about this burgh;” and, again, watching the gates (as in 1498)\r\nagainst persons “coming forth of suspect places where this violent and\r\ncontagious pestilence reigns.” Lodges were erected on the Links and\r\nGallow-hill, where the infected or suspected were to remain for forty\r\ndays. In the following year (1515), sixteen persons were banished from the\r\ntown for a year and a day for disobeying the orders “anent the plague.” On\r\nthe 27th July, 1530, these orders are renewed “for evading this contagious\r\npestilence reigning in the country.” On September 15, 1539 (the year after\r\na plague in the North of England), the plague is called in the municipal\r\norders by a distinctive name: the orders are for avoiding the “contagius\r\ninfeckand pest callit the boiche, quilk ryngis in diverse partis of the\r\nsame [realm] now instantly”--the botch being a name given to plague in\r\nEngland also as late as the Elizabethan and Stuart periods.\r\n\r\nThe years 1545 and 1546 were also plague-years in Scotland. At a council\r\nheld at Stirling on the 14th June, 1545, the session of the law courts was\r\ntransferred to Linlithgow “because of the fear of the pest that is lately\r\nreigning in the town of Edinburgh[731].” On 10th September, of the same\r\nyear, the town council of Aberdeen issued orders for evading the pest. On\r\nSeptember 18 the plague was in the English army at Warkeshaugh, and it is\r\nreported from Newcastle, on 5 October, to be raging on the borders[732].\r\nOn March 21, 1546, a house in Aberdeen was shut up for the pest; and there\r\nare evidences of its continuance in August, October and December both in\r\nthat town and “in certain parts of the realm:” on the 11th October the St\r\nNicholas “braid silver” was given for the sustentation of the sick folk of\r\nthe pest; on the 17th December an Aberdonian named David Spilzelaucht was\r\nordered to be “brint on the left hand with ane het irne” for not showing\r\nthe bailies “the seiknes of his barne, quilk was seik in the pest[733].”\r\nIn November, 1548, the plague is at St Johnstone (Perth), and the\r\nRhinegrave, with troops there, sick of it and like to die[734].\r\n\r\nIn 1564 the Scots Privy Council ordered quarantine for arrivals from\r\nDenmark, in the manner that was practised on merchandise for nearly three\r\ncenturies after. As these early practices in the Forth are curiously like\r\nthose that used to be practised in the Medway in the eighteenth century, I\r\nshall quote a part of the order of the Scots Privy Council, dated,\r\nEdinburgh, September 23, 1564[735]:\r\n\r\n    “That is to say, becaus maist danger apperis to be amangis the lynt,\r\n    that the samyn be loissit, and houssit in Sanct Colm’s Inche,\r\n    oppynout, handillet and castin forth to the wynd every uther fair day,\r\n    quhill the feist of Martimes nixt to cum, be sic visitouris and\r\n    clengearis as sal be appointit and deput thairto be the Provest,\r\n    Baillies and Counsall of the burgh of Edinburgh upoun the expensis of\r\n    the marchantis, ownaris of the saidis gudis. And as concerning the\r\n    uther gudis, pik, tar, irine, tymmer, that the samyn be clengeit be\r\n    owir flowing of the sey, at one or twa tydis, the barrellis of asse to\r\n    be singit with huddir set on fyre, and that the schippis be borit and\r\n    the sey wattir to haif interes into thame, to the owir loft, and all\r\n    the partis within to be weschin and clengeit; and siclike that the\r\n    marinaris and utheris that sall loase and handill the gudis above\r\n    written, be clengeit and kepit apart be thameselffis for ane tyme, at\r\n    the discretioun of the saidis visitouris, and licenses to be requirit\r\n    had and obtenit of the saidis Provest, Baillies and Counsall before\r\n    they presume to resort opinlie or quietlie amangis oure Soverane\r\n    Ladeis fre liegis.”\r\n\r\nThe same autumn another foul ship from the Baltic arrived and entered the\r\nport of Leith in evasion of quarantine; the master and others are to be\r\napprehended and kept in prison until justice be done upon them for the\r\noffence[736].\r\n\r\nA severe outbreak of plague in Scotland in the year 1568 gave occasion to\r\nthe first native treatise upon the disease in the English tongue, the\r\nessay by Dr Gilbert Skene, at one time lecturer on medicine at King’s\r\nCollege, Aberdeen, but probably removed before 1568 to Edinburgh, where he\r\nbecame physician to James VI.[737] The author says that the plague has\r\n“lately entered” the country, and he is led to write upon it in the\r\nvulgar tongue for the benefit of those who could not afford to pay for\r\nskilled advice, or could not get it on any terms: “Medecineirs are mair\r\nstudious of their awine helthe nor of the common weilthe.” The panic\r\ncaused by the plague must have been considerable: “Specialie at this time\r\nwhan ane abhorris ane other in sic maneir as gif nothing of humanitie was\r\nrestand but all consumit, euery ane abydand diffaent of ane other.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Skene’s treatise bears numerous traces of the influence of\r\nforeign writers on plague, the same being freely acknowledged in the\r\nsection of prescriptions and regimen, yet the book is much better than a\r\nmere compilation. Thus, under the causes of plague, he gives the stock\r\nrecital of blazing stars, south-winds, corrupt standing waters, and the\r\nlike; but in mentioning, as others do, dead carrion unburied, he adds that\r\nthe corrupting human body is most dangerous of all “by similitude of\r\nnature.”\r\n\r\n    A season favourable to plague is marked by continual wet in the last\r\n    part of Spring or beginning of Summer, without wind, and with great\r\n    heat and turbid musty air.\r\n\r\n    Anticipating a remark by Thomas Lodge in 1603, and a common experience\r\n    as regards rats in the recent plagues of various parts of India and\r\n    China, he points out that the mole (moudewart) and serpent leave the\r\n    earth, being molested by the vapour contained within the bowels of the\r\n    same. “If the domesticall fowlis become pestilential, it is ane sign\r\n    of maist dangerous pest to follow.” Among the spots that are most\r\n    pestilential are those near standing water, or where many dead are\r\n    buried, the ground being fat and vaporative. Of the duration of\r\n    infection: “na pest continuallie induris mair than three yeris,”\r\n    according to the principle of “rosten ance can not be made raw\r\n    againe.”\r\n\r\n    The diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment are given fully and in\r\n    systematic scholarly order. I give the following long extract on the\r\n    signs and symptoms of plague, as being the first native account of the\r\n    disease in this country:\r\n\r\n    _Quhairby corrupt be pest may be knawin._\r\n\r\n    Thair is mony notis quhilkis schawis ane man infectit be pest. First\r\n    gif the exteriour partis of the bodie be caulde, and the interiour\r\n    partis of the bodie vehement hait. As gif the hoill bodie be heavie\r\n    with oft scharpe punctiounis, stinkand sweiting, tyritnes of bodie,\r\n    ganting of mowthe, detestable brathe with greit difficultie, at\r\n    sumtyme vehement fever rather on nycht nor day.

Cramp, convulsion of limbs, imperfection of\r\n    speech and stinking breath, colic, swelling of the body as in dropsy,\r\n    visage of divers colours, red spots quickly discovering and covering\r\n    themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe great plague which was the occasion of Skene’s writing, probably the\r\nmost severe that Edinburgh experienced, entered that city on the 8th\r\nSeptember, 1568, having been brought, it was said, by “ane called James\r\nDalgliesh, merchant[738].” A letter of 21st September, from the bishop of\r\nOrkney, then in Edinburgh, to his brother-in-law Sir Archibald Napier of\r\nMerchiston, whose house was near the plague-huts erected on the Muir,\r\nrefers to the infection as then active:\r\n\r\n    “By the number of sick folk that gaes out of the town, the muir is\r\n    liable to be overspread; and it cannot be but, through the nearness of\r\n    your place and the indigence of them that are put out, they sall\r\n    continually repair about your room, and through their conversation\r\n    infect some of your servants.” He advises him to withdraw to a house\r\n    on the north side. “And close up your houses, your granges, your barns\r\n    and all, and suffer nae man come therein while it please God to put\r\n    ane stay to this great plague[739].”\r\n\r\nThe following account of Edinburgh practices in plague-times is given by\r\nChambers[740]:\r\n\r\n    “According to custom in Edinburgh the families which proved to be\r\n    infected were compelled to remove, with all their goods and furniture,\r\n    out to the Burgh-moor, where they lodged in wretched huts hastily\r\n    erected for their accommodation. They were allowed to be visited by\r\n    their friends, in company with an officer, after eleven in the\r\n    forenoon; anyone going earlier was liable to be punished with\r\n    death--as were those who concealed the pest in their houses. Their\r\n    clothes were meanwhile purified by boiling in a large caldron erected\r\n    in the open air, and their houses were clensed by the proper officers.\r\n    All these regulations were under the care of two citizens selected for\r\n    the purpose, and called _Bailies of the Muir_; for each of whom, as\r\n    for the cleansers and bearers of the dead, a gown of gray was made,\r\n    with a white St Andrew’s Cross before and behind. Another arrangement\r\n    of the day was ‘that there be made twa close biers, with four feet,\r\n    coloured over with black, and [ane] white cross with ane bell, to be\r\n    hung upon the side of the said bere, which sall mak warning to the\r\n    people.’”\r\n\r\nThe same writer says that the plague lasted in Edinburgh until February,\r\n1569, and that it was reported to have carried off 2500 of the\r\ninhabitants. The plague-stricken in the Canongate were sent to huts “on\r\nthe hill” and money was collected for their support[741].\r\n\r\nThe plague of 1574 was again chiefly along the shores of the Firth of\r\nForth. It came to Leith on October 14th, it was said by a passenger from\r\nEngland, and several died in that town before its existence was known at\r\nlarge. On October 24th it entered Edinburgh, “brought in by ane dochter of\r\nMalvis Curll out of Kirkcaldy[742].” On the 29th October the town council\r\nof Glasgow ordered that no one should be allowed to enter from Leith,\r\nKirkcaldy, Dysart, Burntisland and Edinburgh (in respect of Bellis Wynd\r\nonly), and that no one in Glasgow was to repair to Edinburgh without a\r\npass[743]. Two days after (October 31st) the Scots Privy Council, at\r\nDalkeith, issued an order to check the spreading of the plague landwards\r\n“through the departure of sick folk and foul persons:” no one to conceal\r\nthe existence of plague, and the infected “to cloise thame selffis\r\nin[744].” On November 14th the sittings of the Court of Session were\r\nsuspended owing to pest within some parts of Edinburgh, in Leith, and some\r\ntowns and parts of the north coast of Fife[745]. In December the Kirk\r\nsession of Edinburgh appointed an eight days’ fast for the plague\r\nthreatening the whole realm.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1577, plague is reported to be raging on the English border,\r\ncausing alarm in Kirkcudbright[746]. On the 19th October, 1579, the king\r\nand council are credibly informed that “the infectioun and plague of the\r\npistolence” is not only in divers towns and parts of the coast of England\r\nfrequented by Scots shipping but also in Berwick and sundry other bounds\r\nof the East and Middle Marches of England; the markets at Duns and Kelso\r\nare therefore forbidden, and traders not to repair to infected places or\r\nto break bulk of their wares[747]. Next year, 1580, on September 10th, a\r\nship laden with lint and hemp from “Danske,” with forty persons on board,\r\nincluding seven Edinburgh merchants, arrived in the Forth, and was\r\nquarantined for many weeks at Inchcolm; the master and several others died\r\nof plague, and the survivors were transferred in November, some to\r\nInchkeith and some to Inchgarvie, the ship being still at Inchcolm in a\r\nleaky state. On November 22 a vessel which had come down the Tay with\r\nplague-stricken inhabitants of Perth, some of whom were dead, and with\r\ntheir goods and gear, was ordered to the Isle of May[748].\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious epidemics of plague in Scotland was from 1584 to\r\n1588. It was said to have been brought to Wester Wemyss, in Fife, by a\r\ncertain “creare;” but it was in some other places at the same time, and\r\nwas probably a revival of old seeds of the disease. On July 28th the Privy\r\nCouncil issued orders that beggars and tramps should be kept from\r\nwandering about[749]. On the 24th September, 27th October, 4th November,\r\nand the 11th December, the Privy Council issued order after order to stop\r\nall traffic, unless by licence, from Fife, Perth, and other places north\r\nof the Forth; sails were to be taken out of the ferry-boats at all ferries\r\nexcept Burntisland and Aberdour, and eventually at these also, Leith and\r\nPettycur being left free[750]. For Perth we have some particulars of this\r\ngreat outbreak. From the 24th September, 1584, to August, 1585, there died\r\n1437 persons, young and old[751]. It was also in Dysart and other parts of\r\nFife through the winter of 1584-85[752].\r\n\r\nThe infection appeared at Edinburgh about the 1st of May, 1585, in the\r\nFlesh Mercat Close by the infection of a woman who had been in St\r\nJohnstone (Perth) where the plague was[753]. On the 18th May orders were\r\nissued to Edinburgh to remove all filth, filthy beasts and carrion forth\r\nof the highways, and the same to be cleansed and kept clean. On the 23rd\r\nJune the coining-house was removed to Dundee, and the Court of Session\r\ntransferred to Stirling[754]. The plague next broke out in Dundee, whence\r\nthe mint was removed to Perth. At St Andrews it appeared in August, 1585,\r\nand became a severe epidemic, causing the dispersion of the students, and\r\ncontinuing so long that the miserable state and poverty of the town are in\r\npart ascribed, in a petition of March 24, 1593, to the plague[755].\r\nUpwards of four hundred are said to have died of it there[756]. The state\r\nof sickness was much aggravated by wet harvest weather. In Edinburgh it\r\ncontinued through the winter until January, 1586, sometimes carrying off\r\ntwenty-four in a single night: “the haill people, whilk was able to flee,\r\nfled out of the town; nevertheless there died of people which were not\r\nable to flee, fourteen hundred and some odd” (Birell). James Melville,\r\nriding in November from Berwick to Linlithgow, entered Edinburgh by the\r\nWater-Gate of the Abbey at eleven o’clock in the forenoon and rode up\r\n“through the Canongate, and in at the Nether Bow through the great street\r\nof Edinburgh to the West Port, in all whilk way we saw not three persons,\r\nsae that I miskenned Edinburgh, and almost forgot that I had ever seen sic\r\na town[757].” The same year it was unusually severe at Duns[758]. In the\r\nwinter of 1586-7, “the pest abated and began to be strangely and\r\nremarkably withdrawn by the merciful hand of God, so that Edinburgh was\r\nfrequented again that winter, and at the entry of the spring all the\r\ntowns, almost desolate before, repeopled, and St Andrews among the\r\nrest[759].”\r\n\r\nIn the harvest of 1587 “the pest brake up in Leith, by opening up of some\r\nold kists,” and in Edinburgh about the 4th November. It continued in those\r\ntwo towns till Candlemas, 1588[760]. On April 26, 1588, the infection is\r\nreported anew from Edinburgh, threatening the law session[761]. In\r\nOctober, 1588, it was at Paisley, causing alarm in Glasgow[762].\r\n\r\nOn the 8th August, 1593, a ship from an English port, with persons and\r\ngoods suspected of the plague, was quarantined at Inchcolm[763]. Four\r\nyears after, on the 6th August, 1597, “the pest began in Leith[764].”\r\nTwelve days after, August 18, the Privy Council declared that divers\r\ninhabitants of sundry towns near Edinburgh were infected, and that the\r\ndisease was suspected to be in the capital itself[765]. Many fled from\r\nEdinburgh, but the epidemic was over by the end of harvest[766].\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1598, the plague which was in Cumberland extended to\r\nDumfries, and caused great decay of trade, and even scarcity of food[767].\r\nOn the 12th October, 1600, a petition from Dundee declares that the\r\nplague of the pest had “entered and broken up within the town of\r\nFindorne[768].” Findhorn had been only one of several places infected in\r\nthat locality; for in December, the Kirk session of Aberdeen ordered a\r\nfast “in respect of the fearful infection of the plague spread abroad in\r\ndivers parts of Moray[769].”\r\n\r\nOn the 24th November, 1601, the parishes of Eglishawe, Eastwood, and\r\nPollok, in Renfrewshire, and the town of Crail in Fife are declared\r\ninfected, and ordered to be shut up. On the 28th of the same month it was\r\nin the barony of Calderwood, and on the 21st December, in Glasgow. It\r\nincreased daily in Crail in January, 1602, and suspects were put out on\r\nthe muir, so that they wandered to sundry parts of Fife. It still\r\ncontinued in Glasgow, and had appeared at Edinburgh before the 4th of\r\nFebruary: the town council built shielings and lodgings for the sick of\r\nthe plague in the lands of Schenis (Sciennes) belonging to Napier, of\r\nMerchiston, without his leave, having ploughed up the old plague-muir, and\r\nlet it for their profit: against the plague-shelters Napier protested on\r\nthe 11th March. By the 1st of May it had ceased in Edinburgh, and a solemn\r\nthanksgiving was held on the 20th (Birell). A ship owned in Crail arrived\r\nin the Forth on 30th July, 1602, from “Danske,” with three or four dead of\r\nthe plague, and was quarantined at Inchkeith. In April, 1603, James VI.\r\nleft for England, to assume the English[770] crown, with which event we\r\nresume in another chapter the eventful history of Plague under the\r\nStuarts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the foregoing records of plague in Scotland, the absolute\r\nimmunity of Aberdeen in the latter half of the sixteenth century is\r\nremarkable. It does not depend on any imperfection of the records; for,\r\nunder the year 1603, the borough register contains this entry[771]: “It\r\nhas pleasit the guidness of God of his infinite mercy to withhauld the\r\nsaid plague frae this burgh this fifty-five years bygane”--that is to say,\r\nsince the winter of 1546-47, when David Spilzelaucht was burned on the\r\nleft hand with a hot iron for concealing a case of plague in one of his\r\nchildren. The northern city may have owed its immunity to various causes;\r\nbut there can be no question of the Draconian rigour of its decrees\r\nagainst the plague. Following the example of queen Elizabeth at Windsor in\r\n1563, the magistrates in May, 1585, when Perth, Edinburgh and many other\r\nplaces in Scotland were suffering severely from plague, erected three\r\ngibbets, “ane at the mercat cross, ane other at the brig of Dee, and the\r\nthird at the haven mouth, that in case ony infectit person arrive or\r\nrepair by sea or land to this burgh, or in case ony indweller of this\r\nburgh receive, house, or harbour, or give meat or drink to the infectit\r\nperson or persons, the man be hangit and the woman drownit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in Ireland in the Tudor period.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of plague in Ireland in the Tudor period are not many, but\r\nsome of them are of interest. The province of Munster is said to have had\r\na pestilence raging in it in 1504, evidently not a famine-fever, for the\r\ndearth, and mortality therefrom, came in 1505[772]. There is no doubt as\r\nto the reality of the next plague in Ireland, in 1520.\r\n\r\nThe earl of Surrey writes from Dublin to Wolsey, on the 3rd August, 1520:\r\n“There is a marvellous death in all this country, which is so sore that\r\nall the people be fled out of their houses into the fields and woods,\r\nwhere they in likewise die wonderfully; so that their bodies be dead like\r\nswine unburied.” On the 23rd July he had already written that there was\r\nsickness in the English pale; and on the 6th September he wrote again that\r\nthe death continued in the English pale[773]. It is perhaps the same\r\nepidemic, or an extension of it, that is referred to as the plague raging\r\nin Munster in 1522[774]. On the same authority, “a most violent plague” is\r\nsaid to have been in the city of Cork in 1535, and “a great plague” in the\r\nsame in 1547. The earlier of those dates corresponds probably to a season\r\nof ill-health in Ireland generally: “1536. This year was a sickly,\r\nunhealthy year, in which numerous diseases, viz. a general plague, and\r\nsmallpox [i.e. a disease with an Irish name supposed to be smallpox], and\r\na flux plague, and the bed-distemper prevailed exceedingly[775].” In a\r\nState letter from Ireland September 10, 1535, the prevalence of “plague”\r\nis mentioned[776].\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1566-7, a remarkable outbreak of plague occurred among\r\nthe English troops quartered around the old monastery of the Derry, at the\r\nhead of Loch Foyle, where Londonderry was afterwards built. The men were\r\nlanded there in October, and by November “the flux was reigning among them\r\nwonderfully.” On December 18 and January 13, many of the soldiers are\r\ndead, the rest are discontented, and provisions are short. On February 16,\r\nthe sickness continues, “in this miserable place,” and on March 26, the\r\ndeath at the Derry is said to be by cold and infection: the survivors to\r\nbe removed to Strangford Haven[777]. Only 300 men were fit for service out\r\nof 1100, and several officers of rank were dead. The men’s quarters had\r\nbeen built over the graveyard of the ancient abbey, and the infection of\r\nplague was ascribed at the time to the emanations from the soil[778]. The\r\nscarcity was general in Ireland that winter, and was attended by great\r\nmortality. Sir Philip Sydney, the lord deputy, writes to the queen on\r\nApril 20, 1567: “Yea the view of the bones and skulls of your dead\r\nsubjects who, partly by murder, partly by famine, have died in the fields\r\nis such that hardly any Christian with dry eye could behold[779].”\r\n\r\nIn 1575 there was a severe and wide-spread outbreak of plague, the\r\nlocalities specially named being Wexford, Dublin, Naas, Athy, Carlow, and\r\nLeighlin. The city of Dublin was as if deserted of people, so that grass\r\ngrew in the streets and at the doors of churches; no term was held after\r\nTrinity, and prayers were appointed by the archbishop throughout the whole\r\nprovince[780]. The extremity of the plague in Ireland was such that the\r\nEnglish troops sent by way of Chester and Holyhead had difficulty in\r\nfinding a safe place to land[781]. Whether that outbreak had been\r\nconnected with the military operations (as afterwards in Cromwell’s time),\r\nthe information does not enable us to judge; but Chester and other places\r\nnear, in direct communication with Ireland, had been visited with plague\r\nthe year before (1574).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGAOL FEVERS, INFLUENZAS, AND OTHER FEVERS IN THE TUDOR PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Common Gaols of England date from the Council of Clarendon, in 1164,\r\nby the articles of which the limits of civil and ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction were fixed, and the quarrel between archbishop Becket and\r\nHenry II. reduced to terms. In obedience to Article VII. of the Council,\r\ngaols were built, the chief among them having been at Canterbury,\r\nRochester, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Malmesbury, Sarum, Aylesbury, and\r\nBedford[782]. Little is heard of the unwholesomeness of prison life until\r\nthe medieval period is nearly over--not indeed because the prisons were\r\nbetter managed than they were later. “In the year 1385,” says Stow,\r\n“William Walworth gave somewhat to relieve the prisoners in Newgate; so\r\nhave many others since.” One benefactor brought a supply of water into\r\nNewgate; another, the famous Whittington, left money actually to rebuild\r\nthe gaol, which was done in 1422. For several years before that, Newgate\r\nhad been notorious. An ordinance of 7 Henry V. (1419) for the\r\nre-establishment of the debtor’s prison at Ludgate, so that debtors need\r\nnot have to go to Newgate gaol, was made in compliance with a petition\r\nwhich said that, in “the hateful gaol of Newgate, by reason of the fetid\r\nand corrupt atmosphere, many persons committed to the said gaol are now\r\ndead[783].” The greatest mortality must have been, according to Stow, in\r\n1414, when the gaolers of Newgate and Ludgate died, and sixty-four\r\nprisoners in Newgate[784].\r\n\r\nMore than a century after, in 1522, there occurred the first of a series\r\nof gaol-fever tragedies, which were well calculated to produce the effect\r\nascribed by Aristotle to scenic tragedy, provided only the workings of\r\ncause and effect had been more apparent. The first of these historical\r\nBlack Assizes occurred on the occasion of the gaol delivery at the Castle\r\nof Cambridge in Lent, 1522. The facts, which appear to be given nowhere\r\nbut in Hall’s _Chronicle_ (of almost contemporary authority), are less\r\nfully related than for some of the later instances of the same strange\r\nvisitation; but there is no mistaking the air of reality and the generic\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCambridge Black Assizes.\r\n\r\nIn the 13th year of Henry VIII. at the Assize held in the Castle of\r\nCambridge in Lent, “the justices and all the gentlemen, bailiffs and\r\nother, resorting thither, took such an infection, whether it were of the\r\nsavour of the prisoners, or of the filth of the house, that many\r\ngentlemen, as Sir John Cut, Sir Giles Arlington, Knights, and many other\r\nhonest yeomen, thereof died, and almost all which were present were sore\r\nsick, and narrowly escaped with their lives[785].”\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that nothing is said of the prisoners being infected:\r\nthey were brought from the dungeons to stand their trial in due course,\r\nand the gentlemen and yeomen attending the court officially or as jurors,\r\nor otherwise, were poisoned by their presence. This early chronicle\r\nindicates as the cause, “the savour of the prisoners, or the filth of the\r\nhouse;” and Bacon, in touching upon that class of incidents nearly a\r\ncentury later, indicates “the smell of the gaol,” but says nothing of\r\ncases of fever among the prisoners, having no warrant in the evidence for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nBefore we come to consider the condition of England in the Tudor period,\r\nwith the policy of Henry VIII. for the repression of beggary and crime,\r\nand the appearance of “new fevers” or “strange fevers” and “laskes” in the\r\nchronicles and other records of the time, it will be desirable to make out\r\nas accurately as possible the clinical type of the Assizes fever, and its\r\ncircumstances. For that purpose we must turn to the next recorded outbreak\r\non the occasion of the Assizes at Oxford in 1577, which happens to have\r\nbeen somewhat fully described as a memorable event in the register of\r\nMerton College. The entry in the Merton register appears to have been made\r\nwithin a few weeks of the event[786].\r\n\r\n\r\nOxford Black Assizes.\r\n\r\nThe Assizes met on the 5th and 6th July, 1577, in the Castle and Guild\r\nHall. Those only fell ill, whether in Oxford itself or after leaving, who\r\nhad been present at the Assizes. The two judges (Robert Bell, Chief Baron\r\nof the Exchequer and John Barrham, sergeant-at-law), the sheriff of the\r\ncounty, two knights, eight squires and justices of the peace, several\r\ngentlemen and not a few of their servants, the whole of the grand jury\r\nwith one or two exceptions--these all had not long left Oxford when they\r\nwere seized with illness and died (_statim post fere relictam Oxoniam\r\nmortui sunt_). In Oxford itself, on the 15th, 16th and 17th July, some ten\r\nor twelve days after the Assizes, about three hundred fell ill; and in the\r\nnext twelve days there died (“_ne quid errem_”) one hundred scholars,\r\nbesides townsmen not a few. Five died in Merton College, including one\r\nfellow, the names of four being given who died on the 24th, 27th, 28th and\r\n29th July. Every college, hall, or house had its dead. Women were not\r\nattacked, nor indeed the poor; nor did the infection spread to those who\r\nwaited on the sick or came to prescribe for them. Only those who had been\r\npresent at the Assizes caught the fever. The symptoms are described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    The patients laboured under pain both of the head and of the stomach;\r\n    they were troubled with phrensy, deprived of understanding, memory,\r\n    sight, hearing and their other senses. As their malady increased, they\r\n    took no food, could not sleep, and would not suffer attendants or\r\n    watchers to be near them; their strength was remarkable, even in the\r\n    approach of death; but if they recovered they fell into the extreme of\r\n    weakness. No complexion or constitution was spared; but those of a\r\n    choleric habit were most obnoxious to the disease. The affected\r\n    persons suddenly became delirious and furious, overcoming those who\r\n    tried to hold them; some ran about in courts and in the streets after\r\n    the manner of insane persons; others leapt headlong into the water.\r\n    The spirits of all the people were crushed; the physicians fled, and\r\n    the wretched sufferers were deserted. Masters, doctors, and heads of\r\n    houses left almost to a man. The Master of Merton remained, _longe\r\n    omnium vigilantissimus_, ministering sedulously to the sick. The\r\n    pharmacies were soon emptied of their conserves, oils, sweet waters,\r\n    pixides and every kind of confection.\r\n\r\nThis sudden epidemic, which began on the 15th--17th July, did not last\r\nlong; within the space of one month the city was restored to its former\r\nhealth, so that one wonders, says the registrary of Merton, to see already\r\nso many scholars and so many townsmen abroad in the streets and walks.\r\n\r\nThe infection was suspected by many, says the same eyewitness, to have\r\narisen either from the fetid and pestilent air of thieves brought forth\r\nfrom prison, of whom two or three died in chains a few days before\r\n(_quorum duo vel tres sunt ante paucos dies in vinculis mortui_), or from\r\nthe devilishly contrived and obviously papistical spirits called forth “e\r\nLovaniensi barathro,” and let loose upon the court secretly and most\r\nwickedly.\r\n\r\nThe latter explanation arose out of the heated feelings of the time\r\nagainst papist plotters, and has no farther interest. But the statement\r\nthat two or three of the prisoners had died in chains a few days before\r\nhas a great interest, as showing the kind of treatment to which they had\r\nbeen subjected while awaiting the gaol delivery. A strange confirmation of\r\nthe truth of the statement came to light many years after. When John\r\nHoward visited the Oxford gaol in 1779, in the course of his humane\r\nlabours on behalf of the prisoners, he was told by the gaoler that, some\r\nyears before, wanting to build a little hovel and digging up stones for\r\nthe purpose from the ruins of the court, which was formerly in the Castle,\r\nhe found under them a complete skeleton with light chains on the legs, the\r\nlinks very small. “These,” says Howard, “were probably the bones of a\r\nmalefactor who died in court of the distemper at the Black Assize[787].”\r\n\r\nNext to the Merton register’s account, we may take that of Thomas Cogan, a\r\ngraduate in medicine of Oxford, sometime fellow of Oriel, but probably\r\nremoved to Manchester previous to 1577. Wherever Cogan got his\r\ninformation, he acknowledges no source of the following in his _Haven of\r\nHealth_, 1589:\r\n\r\n    “What kind of disease this should be which was first at Cambridge [in\r\n    1522] and after at Oxford, it is very hard to define, neither hath any\r\n    man (that I know) written of that matter. Yet my judgment is, be it\r\n    spoken without offence of the learned physicians, that the disease was\r\n    _Febris ardens_, a burning fever. For as much as the signes of a\r\n    burning ague did manifestly appear in this disease, which after\r\n    Hollerius be these: Extreame heate of the body, vehement thirst,\r\n    loathing of meate, tossing to and fro, and unquietnesse, dryness of\r\n    the tongue rough and blacke, griping of the belly, cholerick laske,\r\n    cruell ake of the head, no sound sleepe, or no sleepe at all, raving\r\n    and phrensie, the end whereof, to life or death, is bleeding at the\r\n    nose, great vomitting, sweate or laske. And this kind of sicknesse is\r\n    one of those rods, and the most common rod, wherewith it pleaseth God\r\n    to brake his people for sin.... And this disease indeed, as it is\r\n    God’s messenger, and sometimes God’s poaste, because it commeth poaste\r\n    haste, and calleth us quickly away, so it is commonly the Pursuivant\r\n    of the pestilence and goeth before it.... And certainly after that\r\n    sodaine bane at Oxford, the same yeare, and a yeare or two following,\r\n    the same kind of ague raged in a manner over all England, and tooke\r\n    away very many of the strongest sort, and in their lustiest age, and\r\n    for the most part, men and not women nor children, culling them out\r\n    here and there, even as you should chuse the best sheepe out of a\r\n    flocke. And certaine remedy was none to be found.... And they that\r\n    took a moderate sweate at the beginning of their sickness and did rid\r\n    their stomachs well by vomit sped much better. Yet thanks be to God\r\n    hitherto no great plague hath ensued upon it.”\r\n\r\nBesides these medical particulars, he gives certain dates and numbers. It\r\nbegan, he says, on the 6th of July, from which date to the 12th of August\r\nnext ensuing there died of the same sickness five hundred and ten\r\npersons, all men and no women: the chiefest of which were the two judges,\r\nSir Robert Ball, lord chief baron, and maister Sergeant Baram, maister\r\nDoile the high sheriff, five of the justices, four councillors at law and\r\nan attorney. The rest were jurors and such as repaired thither.\r\n\r\nAn account not unlike Cogan’s is given by Stow in his _Annales_ (p. 681);\r\n\r\n    “The 4, 5 and 6 dayes of July were the assizes holden at Oxford, where\r\n    was arraigned and condemned one Rowland Jenkes for his seditious\r\n    toung, at which time there arose amidst the people such a dampe, that\r\n    almost all were smothered, very few escaped that were not taken at\r\n    that instant: the Jurors died presently. Shortly after died Sir Robert\r\n    Bell, lord chief baron, Sir Robert de Olie, Sir William Babington,\r\n    maister Weneman, maister de Olie, high sheriff, maister Davers,\r\n    maister Harcurt, maister Kirle, maister Phereplace, maister Greenwood,\r\n    maister Foster, maister Nash, sergeaunt Baram, maister Stevens, and\r\n    there died in Oxford 300 persons, and sickned there but died in other\r\n    places 200 and odde, from the 6th of July to the 12th of August, after\r\n    which died not one of that sicknesse, for one of them infected not\r\n    another, nor any one woman or child died thereof.”\r\n\r\nStow’s account differs from that of the Merton College register in several\r\nimportant particulars. The latter is explicit that the sickness appeared\r\namong the scholars and townsmen of Oxford on the 15th, 16th and 17th of\r\nJuly, or after an interval of ten days or more, and that the deaths\r\namongst those who had come to Oxford on Assize business did not occur in\r\nOxford but on their return home. On the other hand, Stow makes out the\r\nOxford people to have been smothered by the damp which arose in the court\r\nitself: “very few escaped that were not taken ill at that instant;” next\r\ncome the deaths of the jurors, and “shortly after” those of the judges and\r\nother high officials, whose names are given by Stow more fully than by\r\nanyone. His total of deaths, the same as Cogan’s, is 300 in Oxford and 200\r\nand odd of persons who had left Oxford, and his dates, “from the 6th of\r\nJuly to the 12th of August,” are also the same as Cogan’s.\r\n\r\nWood’s account is for the most part taken from the Merton register and in\r\npart from the very different version in Stow’s _Annals_; but he has the\r\nfollowing new matter: “Above 600 sickened in one night, as a physician\r\nthat now lived in Oxford attesteth, and the day after, the infectious air\r\nbeing carried into the next villages, sickened there an hundred\r\nmore[788].” That, of course, is very unlike the Merton College account,\r\nwhich is explicit that no one caught the fever who had not been in the\r\ncourt. The Oxford physician whose authority is given for the six hundred\r\ncases in Oxford in one night, and the extension next day to villages\r\naround, is Dr George Ethredge, or Ethryg, a physician and learned Greek\r\nscholar living in Oxford at the time and keeping a boarding-house, called\r\nGeorge Hall, for the sons of Catholic gentlemen. In 1588 he published a\r\nsmall volume of comments upon some books of Paulus Aegineta, which is the\r\nauthority given by Wood[789]. On discovering the passage, one finds that\r\nit was not 600 in one night, but “sexaginta” or 60, and that the occasion\r\non which more than sixty were taken ill at once in a single night at\r\nOxford, and nearly a hundred next day in the adjacent villages, “whither\r\nthe infected air had by chance been borne,” was not that of the gaol-fever\r\nin 1577 but of the sweating sickness in 1551. An extension in the\r\natmosphere to the villages around is just what would have happened in the\r\nsweating sickness, a disease in that as in other respects closely\r\nanalogous to influenza. Ethredge says that, on the particular occasion,\r\n“hardly any of the Oxford people died”--a statement which should of itself\r\nhave prevented Wood’s mistake, even if the reference to the same disease\r\nhaving “at the same time” cut off the two sons of the duke of Suffolk “at\r\nCambridge” (therefore a less healthy place than Oxford where hardly any\r\ndied) had not quite clearly pointed to the sudor Britannicus, which is\r\nactually named in the context (“sic enim vocant”)[790].\r\n\r\nAlthough, in the passage quoted, it is the sweating sickness at Oxford in\r\n1551 that Ethredge refers to, he does also refer to the gaol fever of 1577\r\nin another passage which has hitherto escaped notice.\r\n\r\n    In the section of his book next following, entitled “De Curatione\r\n    morborum populariter grassantium, et de Peste,” he says that he had\r\n    used a certain prescription of aloes, ammoniacum and myrrh rubbed\r\n    together in wine, for himself as well as for others in a serious\r\n    contagion, “quae fuit in martiali sede cum ibi essem,” and also, with\r\n    happy effect, upon many “in the most cruel pest at Oxford which\r\n    carried off Judge Bell and ever so many more; one gentleman, I could\r\n    not persuade to try this medicine, whom therefore I commended to God,\r\n    and four days after he was dead. Concerning that pestilential fever,\r\n    many colloquies took place between me and two most learned physicians;\r\n    and, as to the kind of this contagion, we all agreed (_manibus et\r\n    pedibus in hanc sententiam itum est_) in a sentence which I quoted\r\n    from Valescus, who sayeth thus: Those sicknesses are dangerous in such\r\n    wise that the physicians may be for the most part deceived; for we see\r\n    a good hypostasis in the urine, and some other good signs, yet the\r\n    sick person dies”--a remark which often recurs in the early writings\r\n    on plague.\r\n\r\nIt has taken longer than usual to determine the matter of fact as to the\r\nfever of the Oxford Black Assizes, because an erroneous version passes\r\ncurrent on respectable authority; but enough has perhaps been said to\r\nenable us to pass from the matter of fact to the matter of theory[791].\r\n\r\nThe theory of the gaol fever at Oxford, in 1577, was not attempted by any\r\nwriter at the time, nor indeed has it been so in later times; but the\r\nsignificance of the outbreak has been recognized and admitted. An Oxford\r\nscholar, Dr Plot, writing just a century after (1677) mentions the\r\nstatement that a “poisonous steam” broke forth from the earth, having\r\nprobably in his mind Stow’s imaginative explanation, that a damp arose\r\namongst the people and smothered them, very few escaping that were not\r\ntaken at that instant. Plot then proceeds:--\r\n\r\n    “But let it not be ascribed to ill fumes and exhalations ascending\r\n    from the earth and poysoning the Air, for such would have equally\r\n    affected the prisoners as judges, but we find not that they dyed\r\n    otherwise than by the halter, which easily perswades me to be of the\r\n    mind of my lord Verulam (_Nat. Hist._ cent. X. num. 914) who\r\n    attributes it wholly to the smell of the Gaol where the prisoners had\r\n    been long, close, and nastily kept.”\r\n\r\nWe know, indeed, from the register of Merton that “two or three of the\r\nprisoners died in chains a few days before,” which is a sufficient\r\nindication of the state they were kept in, but is no warrant for Anthony\r\nWood’s free rendering of the words: “of whom two or three, _being overcome\r\nwith it_ [i.e. with the “nasty and pestilential smell of the prisoners”]\r\ndied a few days before the Assizes began.” Two or three prisoners died in\r\ntheir chains with symptoms undescribed; and although typhus among the\r\ninmates of gaols has often occurred, it has also been wanting in many\r\ncases where the filth and misery might have bred it in the prisoners\r\nthemselves[792].\r\n\r\nBacon’s judgment on the case, referred to above, was based upon a strict\r\nscrutiny of the evidence, and does not transcend the evidence. He\r\nattributes the infection that arose in the court to “the smell of the\r\ngaol;” and so as not to assume a smell which does not appear to have\r\nattracted any particular notice at the time, he is careful to explain in\r\nwhat sense he means the smell of the gaol:\r\n\r\n    “The most pernicious infection,” he says, “next the plague, is the\r\n    smell of the jail, when prisoners have been long and close and nastily\r\n    kept; whereof we have had in our time experience twice or thrice; when\r\n    both the judges that sat upon the jail, and numbers of those that\r\n    attended the business or were present, sickened upon it and died.\r\n    Therefore it were good wisdom, that in such cases the jail were aired\r\n    before they be brought forth....\r\n\r\n    “Leaving out of question such foul smells as be made by art and by the\r\n    hand, they consist chiefly of man’s flesh or sweat putrefied; for they\r\n    are not those stinks which the nostrils straight abhor and expel, that\r\n    are most pernicious; but such airs as have some similitude with man’s\r\n    body, and so insinuate themselves and betray the spirits[793].”\r\n\r\n\r\nExeter Black Assizes.\r\n\r\nThe next Black Assizes occurred at Exeter in 1586, nine years after the\r\nOxford tragedy. The Exeter incident has had the fortune to be chronicled\r\nby a person as competent as was the writer in the Merton College register\r\nin the former case, namely by John Hoker _alias_ Vowell, chamberlain of\r\nthe city, and its representative in Parliament, a lawyer of good\r\neducation, who must have been conversant with all the circumstances, and\r\nwrote his account within six months. He is known as the chief contributor\r\nto the second edition of Holinshed’s _Chronicle_, in which the history is\r\nbrought down to 1586, his name appearing on the title-page. It is in that\r\nwork that he inserted his account of the Exeter Black Assizes, written in\r\nOctober, 1586. The margin bears the words:\r\n\r\n    “The note of John Hooker _alias_ Vowell;” and the text of the note is\r\n    as follows[794] (III. pp. 1547-8):--“At the assizes kept at the citie\r\n    of Excester, the fourteenth daie of March, in the eight and twentieth\r\n    yeare of hir majesties reigne, before Sir Edmund Anderson, Knight,\r\n    lord chief justice of the common pleas, and sargeant Floredaie, one of\r\n    the barons of the excheker, justices of the assises in the Countie of\r\n    Devon and Exon, there happened a verie sudden and a strange\r\n    sickenesse, first amongst the prisoners of the Gaole and Castell of\r\n    Exon, and then dispersed (upon their triall) amongst sundrie other\r\n    persons; which was not much unlike to the sickenesse that of late\r\n    yeares happened at an assise holden at Oxford, before Sir Robert Bell,\r\n    Knight, lord chiefe baron of the excheker, and justice then of that\r\n    assise....\r\n\r\n    The origin and cause thereof diverse men are of diverse judgment. Some\r\n    did impute it, and were of the mind that it proceeded from the\r\n    contagion of the gaole, which by reason of the close aire and filthie\r\n    stinke, the prisoners newlie come out of a fresh aire into the same\r\n    are in short time for the most part infected therewith; and this is\r\n    commonlie called the gaole sickenesse, and manie die thereof. Some did\r\n    impute it to certain Portingals, then prisoners in the said gaole. For\r\n    not long before, one Barnard Drake, esquire (afterwards dubbed Knight)\r\n    had beene at the seas, and meeting with certeine Portingals, come from\r\n    New-found-land and laden with fish, he tooke them as a good prize, and\r\n    brought them into Dartmouth haven in England, and from thense they\r\n    were sent, being in number about eight and thirtie persons, unto the\r\n    gaole of the castell of Exon, and there were cast into the deepe pit\r\n    and stinking dungeon[795].\r\n\r\n    These men had beene before a long time at the seas, and had no change\r\n    of apparell, nor laine in bed, and now lieing upon the ground without\r\n    succor or reliefe, were soone infected; and all for the most part were\r\n    sicke, and some of them died, and some one of them was distracted; and\r\n    this sickenesse verie soone after dispersed itselfe among all the\r\n    residue of the prisoners in the gaole; of which disease manie of them\r\n    died, but all brought into great extremities and were hardly escaped.\r\n    These men, when they were to be brought before the foresaid justices\r\n    for their triall, manie of them were so weak and sicke that they were\r\n    not able to goe nor stand; but were caried from the gaole to the place\r\n    of judgement, some upon handbarrowes, and some betweene men leading\r\n    them, and so brought to the place of justice.\r\n\r\n    The sight of these men’s miserable and pitifull cases, being thought\r\n    (and more like) to be hunger-starved than with sickenesse diseased,\r\n    moved manie a man’s heart to behold and look upon them; but none\r\n    pitied them more than the lords justices themselves, and especially\r\n    the lord chief justice himselfe; who upon this occasion tooke a better\r\n    order for keeping all prisoners thenseforth in the gaole, and for the\r\n    more often trials; which was now appointed to be quarterlie kept at\r\n    every quarter sessions and not to be posted anie more over, as in\r\n    times past, untill the assises.\r\n\r\n    These prisoners thus brought from out of the gaole to the judgment\r\n    place, after that they had been staied, and paused awhile in the open\r\n    aire, and somewhat refreshed therewith, they were brought into the\r\n    house, in the one end of the hall near to the judges seat, and which\r\n    is the ordinarie and accountable place where they do stand to their\r\n    triales and arraignments. And howsoever the matter fell out, and by\r\n    what occasion it happened, an infection followed upon manie and a\r\n    great number of such as were there in the court, and especially upon\r\n    such as were nearest to them were soonest infected. And albeit the\r\n    infection was not then perceived, because every man departed, (as he\r\n    thought), in as good health as he came thither; yet the same by little\r\n    and little so crept into such as upon whom the infection was seizoned,\r\n    that after a few daies, and at their home coming to their owne houses,\r\n    they felt the violence of this pestilent sicknesse; wherein more died,\r\n    that were infected, than escaped. And besides the prisoners, manie\r\n    there were of good account, and of all other degrees, which died\r\n    thereof; as by name sargeant Floredaie who then was the judge of those\r\n    trials upon the prisoners, Sir John Chichester, Sir Arthur Basset, Sir\r\n    Barnard Drake, Knight[796]; Thomas Carew of Haccombe, Robert Carie of\r\n    Clovelleigh, John Fortescue of Wood, John Waldron of Bradfeeld and\r\n    Thomas Risdone, esquires and justices of the peace.\r\n\r\n    ... Of the plebeian and common people died verie manie, and\r\n    especiallie constables, reeves, and tithing men, and such as were\r\n    jurors, and namelie one jurie of twelve, of which there died eleven.\r\n\r\n    This sicknesse was dispersed throughout all the whole shire, and at\r\n    the writing hereof in the time of October, 1586, it is not altogether\r\n    extinguished. It resteth for the most part about fourteene daies and\r\n    upwards by a secret infection, before it breake out into his force and\r\n    violence.”\r\n\r\nHere we have the same incubation-period as in the Oxford fever, about\r\nfourteen days. But in the Exeter case, we have it clearly stated that an\r\ninfection arose in the prison from the poor Portuguese sailors or\r\nfishermen who had been thrown into “deep pit and stinking dungeon” after\r\ntheir capture on the high seas by Sir Bernard Drake, that the infection\r\nattacked the other prisoners, that many of the prisoners died and all were\r\nbrought to extremities, and that those who stood their trial were then in\r\na most feeble state, although they seemed to the pitying spectators to be\r\nmore starved than diseased.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerned the infection in the Assize Court, among the lawyers,\r\ncounty gentry, and officials, jurors and others, it was of the same tragic\r\nkind as at Oxford in 1577 and at Cambridge in 1522, and, as we shall see,\r\non several occasions in the eighteenth century. But the Exeter case has\r\nsome features special to itself. Within the gaol were both English felons\r\nand thirty-eight Portugals, who had become subject to capture on their way\r\nhome from the banks of Newfoundland with boatloads of stock-fish, and to\r\ntreatment as felons, because Spain and England were at war. Within the\r\ngaol there seems to have been also a gradation of misery, a deep pit and\r\nstinking dungeon, “in the lowest deep a lower deep,” to which were\r\nconsigned the men of foreign breed, the Portugals. It was among them that\r\ndeaths first occurred, in what special form we know not. From them an\r\ninfection is clearly stated by Hoker to have spread through the gaol at\r\nlarge, and to have made many of the prisoners so weak that they had to be\r\ncarried into court. This is quite unlike what we read of in the Cambridge\r\nand Oxford cases, in neither of which was illness noted in the prisoners\r\nor asserted of them, although at Oxford two or three had died in chains a\r\nfew days before. In the Exeter case there were three circles of the damned\r\ninstead of two only: nay there were four. Farthest in were the Portugals,\r\nnext to them were the native English felons, then came those present on\r\nbusiness or pleasure at the Assizes, and lastly there were the country\r\npeople all over Devonshire for many months after. We must take all those\r\npeculiarities of the Exeter gaol-fever together, and explain them one by\r\nanother. It was a somewhat elaborated poison. It had passed from the\r\nforeign prisoners to the English, and in the transmission had, as it were,\r\nconsolidated its power; hence, when the prisoners did give it to those who\r\nbreathed their atmosphere in court, the infection did not limit itself to\r\nthem, as it certainly did at Oxford and, so far as anything is said, at\r\nCambridge also, and as it usually does in typhus-fever; but it became a\r\nvolatile poison, it developed wings and acquired staying power, so that\r\nits effects were felt over the county of Devon for at least six months\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoverty and Vagrancy in Tudor England.\r\n\r\nThe Black Assizes of Cambridge (1522), of Oxford (1577), and of Exeter\r\n(1586) cast, in each case, a momentary and vivid light upon the state of\r\nEngland in the Tudor period as late as the middle of the reign of\r\nElizabeth. It has been pointed out in a former chapter that prices and\r\nwages were favourable to the cultivators of the soil in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, that the English yeomanry sprang up in that period, that village\r\ncommunities and trading towns prospered although their morals were none of\r\nthe best, and that the civil wars of York and Lancaster were so far from\r\ninjuring the domestic peace of England that they even secured it. It was\r\nthe observation of Philip de Comines, more than once quoted before, that\r\nEngland had the “peculiar grace” of being untroubled at large by the\r\ncalamities of her civil wars, because kings and nobles were left to settle\r\ntheir quarrels among themselves. “Nothing is perfect in this world,” says\r\nthe French statesman, who did not like independence of spirit among the\r\nlower orders. But he recognizes the fact as peculiar to England in the\r\nfifteenth century; and there can be little doubt about it.\r\n\r\nThe civil wars were hardly over when the troubles of the common people\r\nbegan. Here, if anywhere, is the turning-point brought into Goldsmith’s\r\npoem of “The Deserted Village:”\r\n\r\n  A time there was, ere England’s griefs began,\r\n  When every rood of ground maintained its man.\r\n\r\nDeserted villages became a reality in the last quarter of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and throughout the century following. We hear of this\r\ndepopulation first in the Isle of Wight, where it affected the national\r\ndefence and therefore engaged the attention of the State. Two Acts were\r\npassed in 1488-9, cap. 16 and cap. 19 of 4 Henry VII. The first declares\r\nthat “it is for the security of the king and realm that the Isle of Wight\r\nshould be well inhabited, for defence against our ancient enemies of\r\nFrance; the which isle is late decayed of people, by reason that many\r\ntowns and villages have been let down, and the fields dyked and made\r\npastures for beasts and cattle.” The second relates that\r\n\r\n    “Great inconveniences daily doth increase by desolation and pulling\r\n    down and wilful waste of houses and towns, and laying to pasture lands\r\n    which customably have been used in tilth, whereby idleness, ground and\r\n    beginning of all mischiefs, daily do increase; for where in some towns\r\n    two hundred persons were occupied and lived by their lawful labours,\r\n    now be there occupied two or three herdsmen, and the residue fall into\r\n    idleness.” The remedy enacted is that no one shall take a farm in the\r\n    Isle of Wight which shall exceed ten marks, and that owners shall\r\n    maintain, upon their estates, houses and buildings necessary for\r\n    tillage.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the same depopulation is given by Dugdale in Warwickshire:\r\nseven hundred acres of arable land turned to pasture, and eighty persons\r\nthrown out of employment causing the destruction of sixteen messuages and\r\nseven cottages. An instance of the same kind has already been quoted from\r\nthe neighbourhood of Cambridge as early as 1414; but it is not until the\r\nsettlement of the dynastic quarrels and jealousies, partly on the\r\nvictories of Edward IV. at Barnet and Tewkesbury in 1471, and completely\r\nafter the victory of Henry Tudor at Bosworth in 1485, that agrarian\r\ntroubles became general. Then began the famous _enclosures_--enclosures\r\nboth of the “wastes” of the manors, and of the open cultivated fields of\r\nthe manors in which all the orders of villagers had their share of\r\ntenancy.\r\n\r\nA few years after, in 1495, the number of vagabonds and beggars had so\r\nincreased, of course in consequence of the enclosures, that a new Act was\r\nrequired, cap. 2 of the 11th of Henry VII. “Considering the great charges\r\nthat should grow for bringing vagabonds to the gaols according to the\r\nstatute of 7 Richard II., cap. 5, and the long abiding of them therein,\r\nwhereby it is likely many of them would lose their lives:” therefore to\r\nput them in the stocks for three days and three nights upon bread and\r\nwater, and after that to set them at large and command them to avoid the\r\ntown, and if a vagabond be taken again in the same town or township, then\r\nthe stocks for _four_ days, with like diet. The deserving poor, however,\r\nwere to be dealt with otherwise, but in an equally futile manner. In\r\n1503-4, by the 19th of Henry VII. cap. 12, the period in the stocks was\r\nreduced to one day and one night (bread and water as before), probably in\r\norder that all vagabonds might have their turn.\r\n\r\nThe most correct picture of the state of England under Henry VII. and\r\nHenry VIII. is given by Sir Thomas More. The passages in his _Utopia_,\r\nrelating to the state of England may be taken as veracious history. A\r\ndiscussion is supposed to arise at the table of Morton, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who was More’s early patron, and who died in 1500. “I durst\r\nboldly speak my mind before the Cardinal,” says the foreign observer of\r\nour manners and custom, Raphael Hythloday; and then follows an account of\r\nthe state of England which lacks nothing in plainness of speech.\r\n\r\n    “But let us consider those things that chance daily before our eyes.\r\n    First there is a great number of gentlemen, which cannot be content to\r\n    live idle themselves, like drones, of that which other have laboured\r\n    for: their tenants I mean, whom they poll and shave to the quick by\r\n    raising their rents (for this only point of frugality do they use, men\r\n    else through their lavish and prodigal spending able to bring\r\n    themselves to very beggary)--these gentlemen, I say, do not only live\r\n    in idleness themselves, but also carry about with them at their tails\r\n    a great flock or train of idle and loitering serving-men, which never\r\n    learned any craft whereby to get their living. These men, as soon as\r\n    their master is dead, or be sick themselves, be incontinent thrust out\r\n    of doors.... And husbandmen dare not set them a work, knowing well\r\n    enough that he is nothing meet to do true and faithful service to a\r\n    poor man with a spade and a mattock for small wages and hard fare,\r\n    which being daintily and tenderly pampered up in idleness and\r\n    pleasure, was wont with a sword and a buckler by his side to strut\r\n    through the street with a bragging look, and to think himself too good\r\n    to be any man’s mate.\r\n\r\n    Nay, by Saint Mary, Sir, (quoth the lawyer), not so. For this kind of\r\n    men must we make most of. For in them, as men of stouter stomachs,\r\n    bolder spirits, and manlier courages than handicraftsmen and ploughmen\r\n    be, doth consist the whole power, strength and puissance of our army,\r\n    when we must fight in battle.”\r\n\r\n    So much for the serving-men of the rich, apt to be discarded to swell\r\n    the ranks of poverty and crime. But further:--\r\n\r\n    “There is another cause, which, as I suppose, is proper and peculiar\r\n    to you Englishmen alone.--What is that? quoth the Cardinal.--Forsooth,\r\n    my lord, quoth I, your sheep that were wont to be so meek and tame,\r\n    and so small eaters, now, as I hear say, be become so great devourers\r\n    and so wild that they eat up and swallow down the very men themselves.\r\n    They consume, destroy and devour whole fields, houses and cities. For\r\n    look in what parts of the realm doth grow the finest and therefore\r\n    dearest wool, these noblemen and gentlemen, yea and certain abbots,\r\n    (holy men, no doubt), not contenting themselves with the yearly\r\n    revenues and profits that were wont to grow to their forefathers and\r\n    predecessors of their lands, nor being content that they live in rest\r\n    and pleasure, nothing profiting yea much annoying the weal public\r\n    leave no ground for tillage; they inclose all into pastures; they\r\n    throw down houses; they pluck down towns and leave nothing standing,\r\n    but only the church to be made a sheep-house. And as though you lost\r\n    no small quantity of ground by forests, chases, lawns, and parks,\r\n    these holy men turn all dwelling-places and all glebe-land into\r\n    desolation and wilderness. Therefore the one covetous and insatiable\r\n    cormorant and very plague of his native country may compass about and\r\n    inclose many thousand acres of ground together within one pale or\r\n    hedge; the husbandmen be thrust out of their own, or else either by\r\n    cunning and fraud, or by violent oppression they be put besides it, or\r\n    by wrongs and injuries they be so wearied that they be compelled to\r\n    sell all. By one means, therefore, or by other, either by hook or\r\n    crook, they must needs depart away, poor silly wretched souls, men,\r\n    women, husbands, wives, fatherless children, widows, woeful mothers\r\n    with their young babes, and their whole household small in substance\r\n    and much in number as husbandry requireth many hands. Away they\r\n    trudge, I say, out of their known and accustomed houses, finding no\r\n    place to rest in. All their household stuff, which is very little\r\n    worth, though it might well abide the sale, yet being suddenly thrust\r\n    out, they be constrained to sell it for a thing of nought. And when\r\n    they have wandered abroad till that be spent, what can they then else\r\n    do but steal, and then justly, pardy! be hanged, or else go about a\r\n    begging. And yet, then also they be cast in prison as vagabonds,\r\n    because they go about and work not; whom no man will set a work,\r\n    though they never so willingly profer themselves thereto.”\r\n\r\nThus were the gaols filled. The policy of Henry VIII. was to hang for\r\npetty theft--“twenty together upon one gallows.” And yet the lawyer, the\r\ndefender of the king’s firm rule, “could not choose but greatly wonder and\r\nmarvel, how and by what evil luck it should come to pass that thieves\r\nnevertheless were in every place so rife and rank.”\r\n\r\nThese descriptions of the state of England were written about 1517, and\r\nthe recitals in various Acts of Henry VIII. bear them out. Thus, in 1514\r\nand 1515 (6 Hen. VIII. cap. 5, and 7 Hen. VIII. cap. 1), the towns,\r\nvillages and hamlets, and other habitations decayed in the Isle of Wight\r\nare to be re-edified and re-peopled. In 1533-4 (25 Hen. VIII. cap. 13),\r\nthere is a more comprehensive Act against the aggrandisements of\r\npasture-farmers, “by reason whereof a marvellous multitude of the people\r\nof this realm be not able to provide meat, drink and clothes necessary\r\nfor themselves, their wives, and children, but be so discouraged with\r\nmisery and poverty that they fall daily to theft, robbery, and other\r\ninconvenience, or pitifully die for hunger and cold.” Some greedy and\r\ncovetous persons have as many as 24,000 sheep: no one to keep above 2,000\r\nsheep under the penalty of 3_s._ 4_d._ for every sheep kept by him above\r\nthat number. Ten years after comes the well-known Act relating to the\r\ndecay of towns[797] (35 Hen. VIII. cap. 4).\r\n\r\nBesides these recitals in Acts of Parliament, we have other glimpses of\r\nthe causes of agrarian distress. Thus, in a letter of June 24, 1528, from\r\nSir Edward Guildford to Wolsey: Romney Marsh is fallen into decay; there\r\nare many great farms and holdings in the hands of persons who neither\r\nreside on them, nor till, nor breed cattle, but use them for grazing,\r\ntrusting to the Welsh store cattle[798].\r\n\r\nIn Becon’s _Jewel of Joy_, written in the reign of Edward VI. the same\r\ncondition of things is described:\r\n\r\n    “How do the rich men, and specially such as be sheepmongers, oppress\r\n    the king’s liege-people by devouring their common pastures with their\r\n    sheep, so that the poor people are not able to keep a cow for the\r\n    comfort of them and of their poor family, and are like to starve and\r\n    perish for hunger, if there be not provision made shortly.... Rich men\r\n    were never so much estranged from all pity and compassion toward the\r\n    poor people as they be at this present time.... They not only link\r\n    house to house, but when they have gotten many houses and tenements\r\n    into their hands, yea whole townships, they suffer the houses to fall\r\n    into utter ruin and decay, so that by this means whole towns are\r\n    become desolate and like unto a wilderness, no man dwelling there\r\n    except it be the shepherd and his dog.” The interlocutor in the\r\n    dialogue answers: “Truth it is. For I myself know many towns and\r\n    villages sore decayed; for whereas in times past there were in some\r\n    town an hundred households, there remain not now thirty; in some\r\n    fifty, there are not now ten; yea (which is more to be lamented) I\r\n    know towns so wholly decayed that there is neither stick nor stone, as\r\n    they say.... And the cause of all this wretchedness and beggary in the\r\n    common weal is the greed of gentlemen which are sheepmongers and\r\n    graziers[799].”\r\n\r\nAgain, in Bullein’s _Dialogue of the Fever Pestilence_ (1664), the groom\r\nRoger who accompanies the citizen and his wife to the country, in the\r\ndirection of Barnet, points out an estate on which the rents had been\r\nraised; the fields had been turned into large pastures, and all the houses\r\npulled down save the manor house: “for the carles have forfeited their\r\nleases and are gone a-begging like villaines, and many of them are dead\r\nfor hunger.”\r\n\r\nVagabonds, beggars, valiant beggars, sturdy beggars, and ruffelers\r\ncontinue to occupy the pages of the Statute Book for many years. In\r\n1530-31 (a long and elaborate Act), and in 1535-6, they are to be\r\nrepressed by the stocks, by whipping, and ear-cropping; “and if any\r\nruffeler, sturdy vagabond, or valiant beggar, having the upper part of the\r\nright ear cut off as aforesaid, be apprehended wandering in idleness, and\r\nit be duly proved that he hath not applied to such labours as have been\r\nassigned to him, or be not in service with any master, that then he be\r\ncommitted to gaol until the next quarter sessions, and be there indicted\r\nand tried, and, if found guilty, he shall be adjudged to suffer death as a\r\nfelon.” A still more distracted Act was made by the Lord Protector in 1547\r\n(1 Ed. VI. cap. 3): if the vagabond continue idle and refuse to labour, or\r\nrun away from work set him to perform, he is to be branded with the letter\r\nV, and be adjudged a slave for two years to any person who shall demand\r\nhim, to be fed on bread and water and refuse-meat, and caused to work in\r\nsuch labour, “how vile soever it be, as he shall be put unto, by beating,\r\nchaining, or otherwise.” If he run away within the two years, he is to be\r\nbranded in the cheek with the letter S, and adjudged a slave for life; and\r\nif he run away again he is to suffer death as a felon. Similar provisions\r\nare made for “slave-children;” while the usual exceptions are brought in\r\nfor the impotent poor. The above statute remained in force for only two\r\nyears, having been from the first a monstrous insult to the intelligence\r\nof the nation, and never applied. It was succeeded by two meek-spirited\r\nActs, 3 and 4 Ed. VI. cap. 16, and 5 and 6 Ed. VI. cap. 2, in which the\r\nimpotent poor are provided for:--collectors in church to “gently ask and\r\ndemand alms for the poor.” By the 1st of Mary, cap. 13, the collections\r\nfor the poor were made weekly. When Elizabeth came to the throne, greater\r\npressure was put upon the well-to-do to support the poor: by the Act of 5\r\nEliz. cap. 3 (1562-3) those who obstinately refused voluntary alms might\r\nbe assessed. A more important Act of Elizabeth was that of her 14th year\r\n(1572-3) cap. 5, “For the Punishment of Vagabonds and for Relief of the\r\nPoor and Impotent.” A vagabond, as before, is to be whipped, and burnt on\r\nthe ear; for a second offence to suffer death as a felon “unless some\r\nhonest person will take him into his service for two whole years;” and for\r\na third offence to suffer death and loss of lands and goods, as a felon,\r\nwithout allowance of benefit of clergy or sanctuary. Aged and infirm poor,\r\nby the same Act, are to be cared for by “overseers of the poor” in every\r\nparish, and to have abiding places fixed for them. In 1575-6 (18th Eliz.\r\ncap. 3), the Act of 1572-3 was amended and explained: “collectors and\r\ngovernors of the poor” are to provide a stock of wool, hemp, iron etc. for\r\nthe poor to work upon, and “houses of correction,” or Bridewells, are to\r\nbe built-one, two or more in every county for valiant beggars or such\r\nother poor persons as refuse to work under the overseers or embezzle their\r\nwork. The last and greatest poor-laws of Elizabeth’s reign were those of\r\nher 39th year (1597-8) caps. 3 and 4 and her 43rd year (1601) cap. 2.\r\nThese remained the basis of the English poor-law down to a recent period.\r\nOverseers of the poor are appointed in every parish--the churchwardens _ex\r\nofficio_ and four others appointed by the justices in Easter week: the\r\noverseers to meet once a month in the parish church after divine service\r\non the Sunday: contributions to be levied by the inhabitants of any parish\r\namong themselves, or the parish or hundred to be taxed by the justices,\r\nfailing the contributions, or, if the hundred be unable, then the county\r\nto be rated “in aid of” the parishes.\r\n\r\nThese being the developments of the poor-law and the law against vagabonds\r\nto the end of the Tudor period, we may now return to our particular\r\nillustrations, and more especially to the illustrations from popular\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nUnder the year 1537, one of the citizen chroniclers of London has an\r\nentry, “Began a collection for the poor, and a great number cured of many\r\ngrievous diseases through the charity thereof.” Under 1540, he records\r\nthat “the collection for the poor people ceased[800].” Preaching before\r\nEdward VI. on the fourth Sunday in Lent, 1550, Thomas Lever, Master of St\r\nJohn’s College, Cambridge, said: “O merciful Lord! what a number of poor,\r\nfeeble, halt, blind, lame, sickly--yea with idle vagabonds and dissembling\r\ncaitiffs mixed among them, lie and creep, begging in the miry streets of\r\nLondon and Westminster[801].” In May, 1552, Ridley wrote to Cecil that the\r\ncitizens were willing to provide for the poor “both meat, drink, clothing\r\nand firing;” but they lacked lodging, and he wanted the king to give up\r\nBridewell “to lodge Christ in,” or in other words, the poor “then lying\r\nabroad in the streets of London.”\r\n\r\nComing to the middle of Elizabeth’s reign, in the year 1579 we find, in an\r\nessay dedicated to the queen by Dr John Jones upon general topics of\r\nhealth and morals, an account of poverty and crime which reads little\r\nbetter than Sir Thomas More’s for 1517. In his 31st chapter on “The great\r\ncost that the commonwealth is at daily in relieving the poore: Of the\r\nnumber of them that are yeerly executed,” he speaks of the new poor-rate\r\nas “a greater tax than some subsidies,” and as a “larger collection than\r\nwould maintain yeerly a good army;” and, of the felons as “a mightier\r\ncompany of miserable captives than would defend a large country, as in the\r\nrecords of the Clerks of the Peace and of the Assize may easily be seen.”\r\n\r\nEven from the outset, the poor-rate does not appear to have met the\r\ndifficulty:\r\n\r\n    “And yet housekeepers be but little less discharged, if ye note the\r\n    continual resort of the needy, especially in the country and towns\r\n    that be incorporate, the poor (as they say) not much the more aided,\r\n    as by the moan they make to travellers may be easily gathered, nor\r\n    theft and wickedness the less practised. For what misery it is to see\r\n    condemned at one assize in a little shire thirty-nine, notwithstanding\r\n    the clemency of the Judges, and three hundred and odd in one Diocese\r\n    to do penance or fine for their loose living in a year. But these be\r\n    the meanest sort only, for the others scape as though it were in them\r\n    no offence. And in one gaol of prisoners three hundred and upwards at\r\n    one time, whereof a great part perhaps may be through negligence of\r\n    justice or cruelty, that otherwise might be punished answerably to the\r\n    offences lawfully.”\r\n\r\nHe then refers to the Bridewells “so charitably and politicly appointed by\r\nthe late Act of Parliament, although not yet in every shire erected.” The\r\nAct of Parliament was that of 1572 and the Bridewells were the houses of\r\ncorrection for vagrants, the first type of workhouses, and so named after\r\nthe Bridewell in Fleet Street, which was given by Edward VI. from being a\r\nroyal residence to be a refuge of the poor. So far as fever was concerned,\r\nit mattered little whether the Bridewell were a poor-house or a prison,\r\nfor in later times gaol fever and workhouse fever were both synonyms for\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been surprising to find this enormous extent of\r\npauperism, vagrancy and crime attended by the distinctive _morbus\r\npauperum_, typhus-fever. But we are here concerned only with the evidence,\r\nand not with antecedent probabilities. The records are, of course, very\r\nimperfect. The gaol-fevers of Cambridge, Oxford and Exeter attracted much\r\nnotice because they touched the governing class. There may have been much\r\nmore gaol-fever unrecorded. Hoker, in his account of the Exeter fever,\r\ndoes indeed say: “and this is commonly called the gaol sickness, and many\r\ndie thereof;” and, in a petition to the Crown, March, 1579, the Queen’s\r\nBench prison in Southwark is said to contain twice its complement, there\r\nis in it a disease called “sickness of the house,” and near a hundred had\r\ndied of that sickness in the prison during the previous six years[802]. We\r\nshall not be able to give colour to our epidemiological history by other\r\nsuch instances from the Tudor period[803]; even for plague itself, the\r\nrecords of particular outbreaks are meagre and almost certainly only a\r\npart of the whole. The epidemics which shall occupy us for the rest of\r\nthis chapter are those that had a general prevalence over the country on\r\ntwo or three occasions, the same general prevalence of fever that recurs\r\nat shorter intervals in the Stuart period and in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have attempted to work out the history of epidemics in Britain\r\nwithout reference to the epidemics in other countries, except in the case\r\nof the Black Death, which had remarkable antecedents in the remote East,\r\nand in the case of the English Sweat of 1528, which overran a great part\r\nof the Continent in 1529 and 1530. To have attempted a parallel record of\r\nepidemics abroad would have served inevitably to confuse the vision; for\r\nthe annals of pestilence in all Europe would have been from year to year\r\nan unrelieved record of sickness and death, an unnatural continuance or\r\nsequence, from which the mind turns away. The several countries of Europe,\r\nand the several cities, had each their turn of plague; but they had each,\r\nalso, their free intervals, sometimes very long intervals, as we have seen\r\nin the case of Aberdeen with no plague for nearly two generations in the\r\nsixteenth century. The epidemiography of each country should therefore be\r\nkept apart; and within a given country care should be taken to prevent\r\nthe illusion of universal sickness, which is apt to be created in the\r\nbringing of scattered centres of disease (such as plague) together in the\r\nsame page.\r\n\r\nBut there are instances of what are called pandemics, or universal\r\nepidemics, of sickness. The Black Death was one such, covering a period of\r\nperhaps four years in Europe, from 1347 to 1350, the curve of the disease\r\nin each locality lasting about six months. With the beginning of the\r\nmodern period we come to more frequent pandemics, not of plague, but of\r\nminor or milder forms of pestilential infection. On the continent of\r\nEurope these were in part related to the state of war, which may be taken\r\nas beginning with the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII. of France in\r\n1494. Typhus-fever, or war-fever with famine-fever, now begins to be a\r\nfamiliar form of sickness--in 1498, 1505, 1510, 1528, and so on. Other\r\nforms are putrid sore throat, dysentery, and varieties of fever included\r\nunder influenza. The various forms were apt to occur together or in\r\nsuccession, so that epidemiography has a “Protean” character. This\r\nepidemic Proteus is at once a great difficulty and a most instructive\r\nfact. It opens up the very old doctrine of “epidemic constitutions” of the\r\nair, which to many moderns savours of unscientific vagueness; and it\r\nbrings us face to face with degrees or kinds of infectiveness which are,\r\nin matter of fact, more wonderful or more incomprehensible than the\r\ndeadlier infections, such as the plague or Asiatic cholera. The most\r\nfamiliar instance of the kind is influenza.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluenza.\r\n\r\nInfluenza enters undoubtedly into the Protean infections of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and is itself no small part of the Proteus. But what is\r\ninfluenza? The name is comparatively modern--Italian of the 18th\r\ncentury--and appears to mean defluxion or catarrh, not in the familiar\r\nsense only, but as derived from the comprehensive pathological doctrine of\r\nhumours: thus the Venetian envoy in London called the sweat of 1551 an\r\n“influsso.” It is open to us to include much or little under influenza;\r\nbut the name itself, having its root in an obsolete doctrine of humours,\r\ncan never be made exact or scientific. Usage has applied it to all\r\nuniversal colds and coughs; and it has been applied capriciously to some\r\nuniversal fevers, but not to others. There are two tolerably clear\r\nreferences to its prevalence in England before the peculiarly unwholesome\r\nstate of Europe began with the modern age. Under the year 1173, the\r\nchronicle of Melrose enters “a certain evil and unheard-of cough” (_tussis\r\nquaedam mala et inaudita_), which affected everyone far and near, and cut\r\noff many.\r\n\r\nOne of the St Albans chroniclers, an unknown writer who kept a record from\r\n1423 to 1431 (reign of Henry VI.), has the following entry under the year\r\n1427: “In the beginning of October, a certain rheumy infirmity (_quaedam\r\ninfirmitas reumigata_) which is called ‘_mure_’ invaded the whole people,\r\nand so infected the aged along with the younger that it conducted a great\r\nnumber to the grave[804].” A good deal is said in this brief passage, and\r\nall that is said points to influenza--the rheumy nature of the malady, the\r\nuniversality of incidence, presumably the suddenness and brief duration,\r\nthe deaths among the aged and the more juvenile. It is known also that a\r\nsimilarly general malady was prevalent the same year in Paris, where it\r\nbore the name of _ladendo_; the particulars given in the French record of\r\nit leave no doubt that it was influenza.\r\n\r\nThe singular name of _pestilentia volatilis_ given by Fordoun to two\r\nepidemics in Scotland in his own lifetime, one which began at Edinburgh in\r\nFebruary, 1430 (1431 new style), and the other at Haddington in 1432,\r\nsuggests that they may have been influenzas, but there is nothing more\r\nthan the name to indicate their nature. Those years are not known to have\r\nbeen years of influenza in any other country of Europe: the record of the\r\nmalady passes direct from 1427 to 1510. There was certainly a great wave\r\nof influenza over Europe in 1510, under the names of _cocqueluche_ and\r\n_coccolucio_. It is said to have come up from the Mediterranean coasts and\r\nto have extended to the shores of the Baltic and North Seas; its\r\nprevalence in Britain is likely enough, and is indeed asserted in one\r\nforeign account, but there is no known native notice of it. Abroad, it had\r\nthe usual character of suddenness, simultaneity and universality, and the\r\nsymptoms of heaviness, prostration, headache, restlessness, sleeplessness,\r\nand for some time after a violent paroxysmal cough, like whooping-cough.\r\nNone died except some children; in some it went off with a looseness, in\r\nothers by sweating[805]. The mention of sweating in the influenza epidemic\r\nof 1510 is not without importance. It may serve to explain a remark by\r\nErasmus, in a letter of 25th August, 1511, from Queens’ College,\r\nCambridge, that his health was still rather doubtful “from that sweat” (_a\r\nsudore illo_[806]); the sweat can hardly have been the sweating sickness\r\nof 1508, three years before, but the still unsettled health of Erasmus in\r\n1511 may perhaps have been the dregs of the influenza of 1510.\r\n\r\nThe next great European epidemic of influenza was in 1557, for which I\r\nshall produce medical evidence of England sharing in it, probably during\r\nthat year and certainly in the one following. But the intervening years\r\nafford some notices of sickness in England, which was neither so severe as\r\nplague at one end of the pestilential scale nor altogether mild at the\r\nother, being forms of illness which contemporaries pronounced to be “new”\r\nand “strange,” and appear to have been of the nature of pestilent fever\r\nand dysentery.\r\n\r\nNeither typhus nor dysentery was really new to England in the sixteenth\r\ncentury; on the contrary, they were (with putrid sore throat and lientery)\r\nthe common types of disease in the great English famines which came at\r\nlong intervals, as described in the first chapter. But on the continent of\r\nEurope typhus and dysentery and putrid sore throat (_angina maligna_)\r\nbegan with the modern age to appear as if capriciously, and independently\r\nof such obvious antecedents as want, although some of the epidemics of\r\ntyphus and dysentery were clearly related to the hardships of\r\nwarfare[807]. Typhus, indeed, was a disastrous malady on the Continent in\r\nthose years, notably in 1528 in Spain, where it was known as “las bubas,”\r\nand in France, where it was called “les poches”--both names relating to\r\nthe spots on the skin, and both more strictly applicable to the eruptions\r\nof the lues venerea, which was then also rampant.\r\n\r\nApart from the gaol fever at Cambridge in 1522, the first mention of those\r\nnew epidemics in England since the end of the medieval period is under the\r\nyear 1540: “This said xxx and two year [of Henry VIII.] divers and many\r\nhonest persons died of the hot agues and of a great lask throughout the\r\nrealm[808].” The “lask” was dysentery, (Stow, in chronicling the epidemic\r\nin his much later _Annales_ calls it “the bloody flux”), and the “hot\r\nagues,” according to later references under that name, appear to have been\r\ninfluenza in the sense of a highly volatile typhus[809]. All that we know\r\nof the circumstances of this epidemic is that the summer was one of\r\nexcessive drought, that wells and brooks were dried up, and that the\r\nThames ran so low as to make the tide at London Bridge not merely brackish\r\nbut salt.\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer of 1551 were the seasons of the last outbreak of the\r\nsweat in England, which curiously coincided with another epidemic of\r\ninfluenza (_cocqueluche_) in France. The years from 1555 to 1558 were a\r\nsickly period for all Europe, the diseases being of the types of\r\ndysentery, typhus, and influenza. The most authentic particulars are given\r\nunder the years 1557 and 1558; and those for England, which specially\r\nconcern us, are now to be given. Wriothesley, a contemporary, enters under\r\nthe year 1557: “This summer reigned in England divers strange and new\r\nsicknesses, taking men and women in their heads; as strange agues and\r\nfevers, whereof many died[810].” Under the year 1558, the continuator of\r\nFabyan’s chronicle says: “In the beginning of this mayor’s year died many\r\nof the wealthiest men all England through, of a strange fever[811].”\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown upon the sickness, general throughout England in\r\n1557-8, also by Stow in his _Annales_. Before the harvest of 1557 corn was\r\nat famine prices, but after the harvest wheat fell to an eighth part of\r\nthe price (5_s._ the quarter), the penny wheaten loaf being increased from\r\n11 oz. to 56 oz.! In the harvest of 1558, he goes on, the “quartan agues\r\ncontinued in like manner, or more vehemently than they had done the last\r\nyear passed, where-through died many old people and specially priests, so\r\nthat a great number of parishes were unserved and no curates to be gotten,\r\nand much corn was lost in the fields for lack of workmen and\r\nlabourers[812].” Harrison, canon of Windsor, says that a third part of the\r\npeople of the land did taste the general sickness, which points to\r\ninfluenza[813].\r\n\r\nThe year 1557 was certainly remarkable on the continent of Europe as a\r\nyear of widely prevalent “pestiferous and contagious sickness,” which was\r\ndescribed by numerous medical writers. That universal epidemic, or\r\npandemic, is usually counted as one of the great historical waves of\r\ninfluenza; and in the annals of that wonderful disease it stands the first\r\nwhich was well recorded by competent foreign observers, including\r\nIngrassias, Gesner, Rondelet, Riverius, Dodonaeus, and Foreest. The\r\ncorresponding sickness in England in 1557 (still more severe in 1558),\r\nwhich carried off many of the wealthiest men, and made so great an\r\nimpression that it is noticed by Stow and Speed, has missed being noticed\r\nby English physicians, with a single exception, and that a casual one. If\r\nthe continental physicians had not been copious in writing on several\r\noccasions when our English physicians were silent, such as the epidemic of\r\nsyphilis in 1494-6, the English sweat of 1529, and the influenza of\r\n1557-8, it might appear ungracious to remark upon the scanty literary\r\nproductiveness of the profession in the Tudor period. Whoever attempts\r\nmedical history for England will soon feel our deficiency in materials,\r\nand become disposed to envy the easier task of the foreign historian. The\r\nacademical physicians of the time hardly ever wrote. The men who wrote on\r\nmedicine were laymen like Sir Thomas Elyot, who justified his interest\r\ntherein by the example of men of his own rank like Juba, king of\r\nMauritania, and Mithridates, king of Pontus; or they were irregular\r\npractitioners desirous to advertise themselves; or booksellers’ hacks like\r\nPaynel; or such as Cogan, a schoolmaster and a physician in one. The\r\nmodern reader will be surprised at the common burden of the prefaces of\r\nmedical (and perhaps other) books in the Tudor period,--the intolerable\r\nnuisance of “pick-faults,” “depravers,” and cavillers, who sat in their\r\nchairs and criticised; and if the modern reader happen to be in quest of\r\nauthentic facts, he can hardly fail to sympathise with Phaer, when he\r\naddresses the academical dog-in-the-manger with the Horatian challenge:\r\n“Si quid novisti rectius istis, candidus imperti; si non, his utere\r\nmecum.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, to collect a few particulars of the prevalent\r\nsickness of 1558 in England from casual notices of it. Thus, it comes\r\ninto a letter to the queen, of September 6, by Lord St John, governor of\r\nthe Isle of Wight, from his house at Letley, near Southampton: sickness\r\naffected more than half the people in Southampton, the Isle of Wight and\r\nPortsmouth (those places being filled with troops under St John’s\r\ncommand), and the captain of the fort at Sandown was dead[814]. Curiously\r\nenough we get an intimate glimpse of this epidemic from a book published\r\nsome years after, the _Dyall of Agues_ by Dr John Jones. In his chapter\r\n“Of the Sweating Fevers” (chapter xiv), after illustrating from Galen the\r\nproposition that a sweat may not be critical and wholesome, but τυφώδης or\r\ntyphus-like, attending the seizure from its outset and “the same said\r\nsweat little or nothing profiting,” he proceeds to point his remarks by\r\nhis own experience:\r\n\r\n    “I had too good experience of myself in Queen Mary’s reign, living at\r\n    Lettlé in my good lord’s house, the right honourable Lord St John,\r\n    beside Southampton, the which, notwithstanding the great sweat, it was\r\n    long after before I recovered of my health, so that the said sweat did\r\n    nothing profit.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to compare the sweat, almost certainly the epidemic\r\nmentioned in St John’s despatch of 6th September, 1558, with the sweating\r\nsickness of 1551:\r\n\r\n    “So in our days, even in King Edward VI.’s reign, it brought many to\r\n    their long home, as some of the most worthy, the two noble princes of\r\n    Suffolk, imps of honour most towardly, with others of all degrees\r\n    infinite many; and the more perished no doubt for lack of physical\r\n    counsel speedily[815].”\r\n\r\nThe next that we hear of this epidemic of the autumn of 1558, is in a\r\ndespatch from Dover, 11 p.m. 6th October: the writer has “learnt from the\r\nmayor of Dover that there is no plague there, but the people that daily\r\ndie are those that come out of the ships, and such poor people as come out\r\nof Calais, of the new sickness[816].” A despatch of 17th October, 1558,\r\nfrom one of the commissioners for the surrender of Calais, Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, at Dunkirk, to the Privy Council, says that he “returned hither\r\nto write his letter to the queen, and found Sir William Pickering very\r\nsore sick of this new burning ague. He has had four sore fits, and is\r\nbrought very low, and in danger of his life if they continue as they have\r\ndone[817].”\r\n\r\nHere we have the same term “new sickness” and “new burning ague” as in the\r\ntwo English chronicles under the year before--the “strange and new\r\nsicknesses” which “took men and women in their heads,” and the “strange\r\nagues and fevers.” The very general prevalence in Southampton, Portsmouth\r\nand the Isle of Wight suggests influenza; the symptom of sweating\r\ndescribed by Jones for his own case during that prevalence is in keeping\r\nwith what we hear of the influenzas of the time from foreign writers, and\r\nso is the long and slow convalescence; the fact of one person having had\r\nfour sore fits of “this new burning ague” is more like influenza than\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\nThe severe mortalities in the autumn of 1558 at Loughborough and Chester\r\nare put down to “plague,” and they may, of course, have been circumscribed\r\noutbursts of the old bubo-plague. If, however, they were part of the\r\ngeneral prevalence of hot or burning agues, which we may take to have been\r\ninfluenza or a very volatile kind of typhus, they would indicate a degree\r\nof fatality in the latter somewhat greater than more recent influenzas\r\nhave had. A high death-rate is, indeed, demonstrable for the year 1558,\r\nfrom parish registers, by comparing the deaths in that year with the\r\ndeaths in years near it, and by comparing the deaths with the births in\r\n1558 itself.\r\n\r\nThe registers of christenings and burials, which had been ordered first in\r\n1538, were kept in a number of parishes from that date; and from 1558,\r\nwhen the order for keeping them was renewed by queen Elizabeth, they were\r\ngenerally kept. Dr Thomas Short, a man of great industry, about the middle\r\nof last century obtained access to a large number of parish registers, and\r\nworked an infinite number of arithmetical exercises upon their\r\nfigures[818]. His abstract results or conclusions are colourless and\r\nunimpressive, as statistical results are apt to be for the average\r\nconcrete mind; nor can they be made to illustrate the epidemic history of\r\nBritain with the help of his companion volumes, ‘A General Chronological\r\nHistory of the Air, Weather, Seasons, Meteors etc[819].’, for these\r\nextraordinary annals are for the most part loosely compiled from foreign\r\nsources, bringing into one focus the most scattered references to disease\r\nin any part of Europe, and that too without criticism of authorities but\r\noften with surprising credulity and inaccuracy. That so much statistical\r\nor arithmetical zeal and exhaustiveness (in the work of 1750) should go\r\nwith so total a deficiency of the critical and historical sense, (in the\r\nwork of 1749) is noteworthy, and perhaps not unparalleled in modern times.\r\nShort’s history is mostly foreign, but his statistics, which are English,\r\nmay be used to illustrate and confirm what can be learned of sicknesses in\r\nEngland in the ordinary way of historical research.\r\n\r\nThus, the period from 1557 to 1560 stands out in Short’s table as one of\r\nexceptional unhealthiness both in country parishes and in market towns,\r\nthe unhealthiness being estimated by the excess of burials over\r\nchristenings.\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n           Registers    Unhealthy    Baptised    Buried\r\n  Year     examined      Parishes    in same    in same\r\n\r\n  1557        16            7           62         181\r\n  1558        26           11          171         340\r\n  1559        34           12          145         252\r\n  1560        38            6          100         162\r\n  1561        41            1           19          32\r\n\r\n_Market Towns._\r\n\r\n           Registers    Unhealthy    Baptised    Buried\r\n  Year     examined       Towns      in same    in same\r\n\r\n  1557         4            2          262         381\r\n  1558         4            2          104         159\r\n  1559         5            3          102         149\r\n  1560         8            3          134         201\r\n  1561         8            3          276         399\r\n  1562         8            1           58          71\r\n\r\nShort’s collection of parish registers appears to have represented many\r\nEnglish counties, although there is no clue to their identity in the\r\ntables from which these figures are taken. The heavy mortalities in the\r\nregisters correspond exactly to the epidemic years as otherwise known, and\r\nmay be said to bear witness to the extent or generality of the epidemic\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe next that we hear of malignant fevers in England is the outbreak at\r\nOxford in 1577, following the Assizes. Anthony Wood says of it: “Some\r\nthought that this Oxford mortality was the same that Leonard Fuchsius\r\nstyles sudor Anglicus.” Cogan, a contemporary, says:\r\n\r\n    “And certainly after that sudden bane at Oxford, the same year and a\r\n    year or two following, the same kind of agues raged in a manner all\r\n    over England, and took away very many of the strongest sort in their\r\n    lustiest age, and for the most part men and not women nor children,\r\n    culling them out here and there, even as you should choose the best\r\n    sheep out of a flock. And certain remedy was none to be found.... And\r\n    they that took a moderate sweat at the beginning of their sickness,\r\n    and did rid their stomachs well by vomit, sped much better.”\r\n\r\nThis is partly confirmed by Short’s abstracts of the parish registers.\r\nThus in 1580, of sixty registers examined, ten showed unhealthiness, the\r\nbirths being to the deaths as 248 to 284. In 1582, seven country parishes\r\nwere markedly unhealthy, the births being to the deaths as 140 to 244. In\r\nmarket towns the incidence is not so striking: in 1580, four towns out of\r\nsixteen examined showed an unhealthy birth-rate, 237 births to 276 deaths.\r\nIt is in 1583 that the disparity becomes greatest in these towns: three\r\nout of the sixteen in the list were notably unhealthy, the deaths being\r\n1062 and the births 467. But it is the obvious defect of Short’s method\r\nthat we have no means of knowing whether that mortality may not have been\r\nlargely from plague, and not from fever or other form of epidemic\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe only year between 1558 and 1580 in Short’s tables, which stands out as\r\ndecidedly unhealthy both in country parishes and market towns is 1570,\r\nwhile the years from 1573 to 1575 are less healthy than the average. Those\r\nwere years of war, and of war-typhus, on the Continent, as the foreign\r\nwritings show, but there are no records of the kind of sickness in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOne glimpse of the prevalence of those fevers of 1580-82 is got from a\r\nletter of the earl of Arundell to Lord Burghley, October 19, 1582. The\r\nearl had left his house in London because it was so “beset and\r\nencompassed” by plague; while, as to his country house: “The air of my\r\nhouse in Sussex is so corrupt even at this time of the year as, when I\r\ncame away, I left xxiv sick of hot agues.” He therefore begs the loan of\r\nthe bishop of Chichester’s house till such time as the vacancy in the see\r\nshould be filled up[820].\r\n\r\nThe widespread volatile sicknesses of 1557-8 and 1580-2, which are grouped\r\nunder the generic name of influenza, were related in time to great\r\nepidemics of the far more deadly bubo-plague. These plague outbursts were\r\nless noticeable in England than abroad. Thus in 1557 there were most\r\ndisastrous epidemics of true bubo-plague in several towns of the Low\r\nCountries, and in 1580 there was at Cairo one of the worst epidemics in\r\nthe whole history of plague from its beginning. The years preceding 1580\r\nwere also plague-years in many parts of Europe (Padua, Mantua, Venice,\r\nMessina, Palermo, Lisbon, Brussels). Those years were also the occasion of\r\nthe first great and disastrous epidemics of diphtheria (_garottillo_) in\r\nSpain. Then come the epidemics of typhus; and at the far end of the\r\npestilential scale the flying waves of influenza. A relation of influenza\r\nto other prevalent infections has been one of the theories of its nature,\r\nespecially the relation to epidemics of Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nIn that view influenza looks as if it were a volatile product, a swifter\r\nand more superficial wave on the top of some slower and more deadly\r\nearth-borne virus. As the old writers said, it was a _levis corruptio\r\naeris_, a diluted virus as it were, mild in proportion to its volatility\r\nand swiftness, but in universality equalling in its own milder way the\r\nuniversality of the plague of Justinian’s reign or of the Black Death.\r\n\r\nNow, the same century and the same state of society which witnessed the\r\nmost remarkable of those flying ripples of infection over the whole\r\nsurface of Europe witnessed also some waves of infection which did not\r\ntravel so far, nor were mere influenzas. The English sweat travelled over\r\nEngland in that way; it was called the posting sweat, because it posted\r\nfrom town to town: thus in 1551 it suddenly appeared one day in Oxford,\r\nand next day it was in the villages around, as if carried in the air; in\r\nlike manner it posted to Devonshire, to Leicestershire, to Cheshire, and\r\ndoubtless all over England, like the influenzas of recent memory. And\r\nwhile the English sweat was thus flying about in England, influenza was\r\nflying about the same year (1551) in France, a country which never\r\nsuffered from any of the five sweating sicknesses of 1485-1551. Again, the\r\ninfluenza in England in 1558 had the symptom of sweating so marked that it\r\nwas compared to the true sweat of 1551 by Dr Jones, who himself suffered\r\nfrom it. Also the influenza of 1580 all over Europe had so much of a\r\nsweating character that in some places they said the English sweat had\r\ncome back. Lastly, the gaol-fever of Oxford in 1577 was thought by some to\r\npresent the symptoms described by Leonard Fuchs for _sudor Anglicus_; and\r\nCogan, an English medical writer then living, specially mentions the\r\nphenomenon of sweating (as well as the intestinal profluvium called a\r\n“lask”), both at Oxford and in the more widely prevalent diseases of that\r\nyear and the years following. The gaol-fever of Exeter in 1586 illustrates\r\nstill another side of the question; it diffused itself--probably by other\r\nmeans than contact with the sick--all over the county of Devon, and had\r\nnot ceased six months after it began in the month of March at Exeter. The\r\nDevonshire diffusion was like the spreading circles in a still pool. The\r\nspread of influenza was like the flying ripples on a broad surface of\r\nwater. The spread of plague, on the occasions when it was universal, was\r\nlike the massive rollers of the depths, the onward march of cholera from\r\nthe East having, in our own times, illustrated afresh the same momentum.\r\n\r\nIn using hitherto the name of influenza for the universal fevers in\r\nEngland in 1557-58 and in 1580-82, I have done so because those years are\r\nusually reckoned in the annals of influenza. But the name is at best a\r\ngeneric one, and need not commit us to any nosological definition. I shall\r\nhave to deal at more length with this question in the tenth chapter, when\r\nspeaking of the fevers of 1657-59 described by Willis and Whitmore, two\r\ncompetent medical observers; in those years the vernal fever was a\r\ncatarrhal fever, or influenza proper, while the fever of the hot and dry\r\nseason, autumnal or harvest-fever, was a pestilential fever, a spotted\r\nfever, a burning ague, a contagious malignant fever. There were also\r\ndifferences in their epidemological as well as in their clinical\r\ncharacters, the influenza wave being soonest past. But so far as regarded\r\nuniversality of diffusion and generality of incidence, both types were\r\nmuch alike.\r\n\r\nMolineux, writing in 1694, a generation after Willis, “On the late general\r\ncoughs and colds,” brought into comparison with them another epidemic\r\nwhich he had observed in Dublin in the month of July, 1688: “The transient\r\nfever of 1688 ... I look upon to have been the most universal fever, as\r\nthis [1693] the most universal cold, that has ever appeared[821].”\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the 18th century, to great epidemics not only in connexion\r\nwith famine in Ireland, but also in England, we shall find the same\r\ndiffusiveness associated with the clear type of disease which we now call\r\ntyphus. Influenza is the only sickness familiar to ourselves which shows\r\nthe volatile character, and we are apt to conclude that no other type of\r\nfever ever had that character. But, without going farther back than the\r\n18th century we shall find epidemics of spotted typhus resting like an\r\natmosphere of infection over whole tracts of Britain and Ireland, town and\r\ncountry alike; and even if we give the name of influenza to the epidemical\r\n“hot agues” with which we are here immediately concerned, in the years\r\n1540, 1557-8, and 1580-82, we may also regard them as in a manner\r\ncorresponding to, if not as embracing, the types of fever that prevailed\r\nfrom time to time over wide districts of country in the centuries\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe term “ague,” often used at the time, is no more decisive for the\r\nnosological character than the term “influenza.” Ague originally meant a\r\nsharp fever (_febris acuta_, ὄξυς), and in Ireland, from the time of\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis down to the 18th century, it meant the acute fever of\r\nthe country, which has not been malarial ague, in historical times at\r\nleast, but typhus. “Irish ague” was in later times a well-understood term\r\nfor contagious pestilential fever or typhus. In the _Dyall of Agues_ by Dr\r\nJohn Jones (1564 ?), just as in the writings of Sydenham a century later,\r\nintermittents were mixed up with continued fevers which had nothing\r\nmalarial in their cause or circumstances. Thus, Jones has a chapter on\r\n“Hot Rotten Agues,” which he identifies with the synochus or continued\r\nfever of the Greeks; in another chapter on “The Continual Rotten Ague,” he\r\nlocates the continued fevers within the vessels and the “interpolate”\r\nwithout their walls, and proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “It happeneth where all the vessels, but most chiefly in the greatest\r\n    which are annexed about the flaps of the lungs and spiritual members,\r\n    all equally putrefying, which often happeneth, as Fuchsius witnesseth,\r\n    of vehement binding and retaining the filth in the cavity or\r\n    hollowness of the vessels, inducing a burning heat. Wherefore, this\r\n    kind of fever chanceth not to lean persons, nor to such as be of a\r\n    thin constitution and cold temperament, nor an old age (that ever I\r\n    saw), but often in them which abound with blood and of sanguine\r\n    complexion, replenished with humour, fat and corpulent, solemners of\r\n    Bacchus’ feasts,--gorge upon gorge, quaff upon quaff--not altogether\r\n    with meat or drink of good nourishment but of omnium gatherum, as well\r\n    to the destruction of themselves as uncurable to the physician, as by\r\n    my prediction came to pass (besides others) upon a gentleman of\r\n    Suffolk, a little from Ipswich, who by the causes aforesaid got his\r\n    sickness, and thereof died the ninth day, according to my prediction,\r\n    as his wife and friend knoweth.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in his eighth chapter, “Of the Pestilential Fever, or Plague, or\r\nBoche [Botch],” he remarks upon the varying types of pestilential\r\ndiseases, mentioning among other national types the English sweat:\r\n\r\n    “As we, not out of mind past, with a sweat called stoupe galante, as\r\n    that worthy Doctor Caius hath written at large in his book _De\r\n    Ephemera Britannica_,” adding the remark that here concerns us:--“and\r\n    sethence [since then], with many pestilential agues, and, lastly of\r\n    all, with the pestilential boche [botch or plague rightly termed].”\r\n    These continued fevers, pestilential agues, or hot rotten agues, Jones\r\n    distinguishes from quotidians, tertians and quartans. Of the last he\r\n    says: “and when quartans reign everywhere, as they did of no long\r\n    years past; of the which then I tasted part, besides my experience had\r\n    of others,”--probably the fevers of 1558, elsewhere called by him the\r\n    sweating sickness, and by Stow called “quartan agues.” He mentions\r\n    also quintains, which he had never seen in England, “but yet in\r\n    Ireland, at a place called Carlow, I was informed by Mr Brian Jones,\r\n    then there captain, of a kerne or gentleman there that had the\r\n    quintain long.”\r\n\r\nNot only the term “ague,” but also the terms “intermittent,” “tertian,”\r\nand more especially “quartan,” can hardly be taken in their modern sense\r\nas restricted to malarial or climatic fevers. An intermittent or\r\nparoxysmal character of fevers was made out on various grounds, to suit\r\nthe traditional Galenic or Greek teaching; but the paroxysms and\r\nintermissions were not associated specially with rise and fall of the\r\nbody-temperature. The curious history of agues, and of the specialist\r\nague-curers, properly belongs to the time of the Restoration, when\r\nPeruvian bark came into vogue, and will be fully dealt with in the first\r\nchapter of another volume.\r\n\r\nThe last years in the Tudor period that stand out conspicuously in the\r\nparish registers for a high mortality, not due to plague, are 1597-8. The\r\nyear 1597 was a season of influenza in Italy, and perhaps elsewhere in\r\nEurope; so that the epidemic in England that year may have been the same,\r\nbut more probably was famine-fever. In the parish register of Cranbrooke\r\nthe deaths for the year are 222, against 56 births; and 181 of the deaths\r\nare marked with the mark which is supposed to mean plague proper. The\r\nregister of Tiverton has 277 deaths, against 66 births, but it is almost\r\ncertain that the cause of the excess was not plague, of which the nearest\r\nepidemic in that town was in 1591. In a country parish of Hampshire, with\r\na population of some 2700, the deaths in 1597 were 117, against 48 births,\r\nthe mortality being about twice as great as in any year from the\r\ncommencement of the register in 1569, and after until 1612[822]. In the\r\nnorth of England the type of disease in 1597-8 was plague proper.\r\n\r\nThe parish register of Finchley has a remarkable entry under the year 1596\r\nwhich introduces us to other considerations: “Hoc anno moriebantur de\r\ndysenteria xix,” the whole number of burials for the year having been 28.\r\nNext year, 1597, there are 23 deaths from dysentery, the burials in all\r\nhaving been 48--an enormous mortality compared with the average of the\r\nparish. The year 1597, if not also 1596, was a year of great scarcity,\r\napparently all over England; in Northumberland, Durham, and Cumberland,\r\nthe scarcity was attended by plague proper; but in other parts of England,\r\nit would seem, by other types of sickness, of which dysentery was one.\r\n\r\nOne of the 16th century English names used for flux was the obsolete word\r\nlask, which occurs often enough in writings of the period to suggest that\r\nthe malady was common; it is sometimes called a choleric lask (cholera\r\nmorbus), or a vehement lask, as in Elyot’s _Castel of Health_ and in\r\nCogan’s _Haven of Health_. Lasks, or lienteries, or dysenteries have not\r\nbeen dealt with in a chapter by themselves because the records of them are\r\ntoo few and meagre, so far as we have gone in the history; but it may be\r\nconvenient to bring together here the better known instances. In the\r\nperiod of famine-sicknesses, dysentery and lientery must have been common\r\ntypes, the latter being specially mentioned by Rishanger of St Albans for\r\nthe year 1294. Trokelowe, another St Albans chronicler, writing of the\r\nfamine-sickness of 1315-16, uses the singular phrase “morbus enim\r\ndysentericus ex corruptis cibis fere omnes maculavit” and says it was\r\nfollowed by “acuta febris vel pestis gutturuosa.” Dysentery from corrupt\r\nfood is again specially named for the year 1391. The “wame-ill” was the\r\nprevalent type of sickness in the great Scots famine of 1439, a year of\r\nfamine in England and France. When we next hear of it in English history\r\nit is among the troops of the marquis of Dorset in Gascony and Biscay in\r\n1512, some 1800 of them having died of “the flix.” Then comes the “great\r\nlask throughout the realm” in 1540, associated with “strange fevers.” The\r\nsickly years 1557-58 and 1580-82 had probably some dysentery, or lientery,\r\neither as primary maladies or as complications of the fevers: Cogan’s\r\ngeneralities imply as much for 1580-82, and we know that the corresponding\r\nsickly period a century after (1657-59) was so characterised in the\r\ndescription by Willis. The fatal infection in the fleet after the defeat\r\nof the Spanish Armada, in August, 1588, was probably dysentery and\r\nship-fever. Many other instances of the kind remain to be given in the\r\nchapter on the sicknesses of voyages and colonial settlements.\r\n\r\nDysentery begins to be heard of more frequently in the Stuart period, as a\r\nmalady of London. It is a prominent item, along with summer diarrhoea, in\r\nthe London bills of mortality from the year 1658, under the name “griping\r\nof the guts,” and is occasionally mentioned in letters from London about\r\nthe same years. The dysentery of London in 1669 was the subject of\r\nSydenham’s observations, who says that it had been rarely seen in the\r\npreceding ten years[823]. On the other hand he speaks of “the endemic\r\ndysentery of Ireland,” although he is not sure as to its type or\r\nspecies[824]. Statements as to the Irish “country disease,” are as old as\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis[825]; but as the whole question of dysentery is\r\nintimately bound up with that of typhus-fever, I shall reserve\r\nconsideration of its prevalence in Ireland on the great scale, as well as\r\nof the annual mortality from it in the London bills of the 17th century,\r\nuntil that section of the work in which fevers and the maladies akin to\r\nthem come into the first rank as if in lieu of the plague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE. A sweating character in the “hot agues” or fevers of the Elizabethan\r\nperiod, in those of 1580-82 as well as in those of 1557-58, is asserted in\r\nseveral passages in the text. It is noteworthy that in _Measure for\r\nMeasure_, one of Shakespeare’s early comedies, the bawd says: “Thus, what\r\nwith the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and what with\r\npoverty, I am custom-shrunk” (Act I. Scene 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH POX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great epidemic disease of the first Tudor reigns, which brought\r\nconsternation and distress to multitudes, makes hardly any appearance in\r\nthe English records of the time, and no appearance at all in the writings\r\nof the English profession. Long after, in 1576, William Clowes, surgeon to\r\nSt Bartholomew’s Hospital, first broke the professional silence about\r\n_lues venerea_ in England, and in his larger work of 1579 he gave a number\r\nof startling facts and figures of its then prevalence in London. But the\r\ngreat epidemic outburst of that disease in Europe began in the last years\r\nof the 15th century; its ravages on the epidemic scale are supposed to\r\nhave lasted for twenty or thirty years from 1494; and its subsequent\r\nprevalence is assumed, not without reason, to have been of a milder type\r\nand within narrower limits. We hear of it, in England, from the political\r\nside, at the time when popular arguments were wanted against the Romish\r\nmass-priests and against the monasteries and the orders of friars. In the\r\npractical reasoning of Englishmen the scandalous lives of priests, monks\r\nand friars made the strongest argument for the policy which the king had\r\nadopted towards Rome; and it so happened in those very years that a\r\nscandalous life was betrayed, and made odious in more than sentiment, by\r\nbearing an outward and visible sign. The epidemic of _morbus Gallicus_\r\narose at an unfortunate time for the pretensions of Rome, or, perhaps, it\r\nwas itself part of the march of events. In Simon Fish’s _Supplication of\r\nBeggars_, which was compiled in 1524 and was read to Henry VIII. shortly\r\nafter, the weightiest plea is the charge of scandalous conduct resting\r\nupon the priests. In the inquisitions which preceded the suppression of\r\nthe monasteries, the same plea is, justly or unjustly, brought to the\r\nfront in the case of one abbey after another. So close did the association\r\nof a scandalous vice and its attendant disease become with the priesthood\r\nthat James I., writing long after concerning the sentiments of his mother,\r\nMary the queen of Scots, represents her as forbidding the archbishop “to\r\nuse the spittle” in his own baptism, for the reason that she would not\r\nhave “a pokie priest to spet in her child’s mouth[826].” These, says king\r\nJames, were “her owne very words;” at all events, “a pocky priest” may be\r\naccepted as a phrase of the time. The fact that the epidemic of syphilis\r\nin England was used to discredit Romish priests is one of the few\r\nindications that we have of its existence in this country. Wide and deep\r\nas the commotion must have been which it caused, it found hardly any more\r\npermanent expression than the private talk of the men of those days. It\r\nwas otherwise on the Continent. There, indeed, a copious literature sprang\r\nup, of which some thirty works remain, from the essay of Conrad Schellig\r\nof Heidelberg, printed without date or place, but ascribed to the year\r\n1494 or 1495, down to the elaborate survey of the disease by Nicolas Massa\r\nof Venice in 1532. The single work extant in England from that, the\r\nearliest and greatest, period of the disease, is a poor piece of\r\nmanuscript in the Sloane collection, translated from some foreign author,\r\nand entitled, “The tretese of the pokkis: and the cure by the nobull\r\ncounsell of parris[827].” One of its cases is that of a man, aged forty,\r\nwith two broad and deep, corroding and painful sores on his leg; another\r\nis of a bishop of Toledo, who had “pustules” and nocturnal pains “as if\r\nthe bones would part from the flesh.” The vague meaning of the term pox is\r\nshown in one phrase, “paynes, viz. aches and pokkis.”\r\n\r\nIt was nothing unusual abroad to give cases, and to authenticate them with\r\nthe names of the sufferers. Thus Peter Pinctor, physician to the pope\r\nAlexander Borgia, in a notorious but exceedingly scarce work published in\r\n1500, enters fully into the truly piteous case of the cardinal bishop of\r\nSegovia, major-domo of the Vatican, “qui hunc morbum patiebatur cum\r\nterribilibus et fortissimis doloribus, qui die ac nocte, praecipue in\r\nlecto, quiescere nec dormire poterat,” as well as into the case of Peter\r\nBorgia, the pope’s nephew, “in quo virulentia materiae pustularum capitis\r\ncorrosionem in pellicaneo [pericranio] et in craneo capitis sui manifeste\r\nfecit[828].”\r\n\r\nContrasted with the copious writing and recording of cases abroad, the\r\nEnglish silence is remarkable. The origin of our first printed book on the\r\nsubject is characteristic. A literary hack of the time, one Paynel, a\r\ncanon of Merton Abbey, had translated, among other things, the _Regimen\r\nSalernitanum_, a popular guide to health several hundred years old. Going\r\none day into the city to see the printer about a new edition, he was asked\r\nby the latter to translate the essay on the cure of the French pox by\r\nmeans of guaiacum (or the West-Indian wood) “written by that great clerke\r\nof Almayne, Ulrich Hütten, knyght.” For, said the printer, “almost into\r\nevery part of this realme this most foul and peynfull disease is crept,\r\nand many soore infected therewith.” Ulrich von Hütten’s personal\r\nexperience of the guaiacum cure was accordingly translated from the Latin,\r\nin 1533, and proved a good venture for the printer, several editions\r\nhaving been called for[829]. The translation has no notes, and throws no\r\nlight on English experience. It is not until 1579, when Clowes published\r\nhis essay on the morbus Gallicus, that we obtain any light from the\r\nfaculty upon the prevalence of the malady in England. Meanwhile it remains\r\nfor us to collect what scraps of evidence may exist, in one place or\r\nanother, of this country’s share in the original epidemic invasion during\r\nthe last years of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarliest Notices of the French Pox in Scotland and England.\r\n\r\nThe first authentic news of it comes from the Council Register of the\r\nborough of Aberdeen under the date 21st April, 1497[830]:--\r\n\r\n    “The said day, it was statut and ordanit be the alderman and consale\r\n    for the eschevin of the infirmitey cumm out of Franche and strang\r\n    partis, that all licht weman be chargit and ordaint to decist fra thar\r\n    vicis and syne of venerie, and all thair buthis and houssis skalit,\r\n    and thai to pas and wirk for thar sustentacioun, under the payne of\r\n    ane key of het yrne one thar chekis, and banysene of the towne.”\r\n\r\nThe next news of it is also from Scotland, from the minutes of the town\r\ncouncil of Edinburgh, wherein is entered a proclamation of James IV.,\r\ndated 22 September, 1497[831]:--\r\n\r\n    “It is our Soverane Lords Will and the Command of the Lordis of his\r\n    Counsale send to the Provest and Baillies within this bur{t} that this\r\n    Proclamation followand be put till execution for the eschewing of the\r\n    greit appearand danger of the Infection of his Leiges fra this\r\n    contagious sickness callit the _Grandgor_ and the greit uther Skayth\r\n    that may occur to his Leiges and Inhabitans within this bur{t}; that\r\n    is to say, we charge straitly and commands be the Authority above\r\n    writtin, that all manner of personis being within the freedom of this\r\n    bur{t} quilks are infectit, or hes been infectit, uncurit, with this\r\n    said contagious plage callit the _Grandgor_, devoyd, red and pass\r\n    fur{t} of this Town, and compeir upon the sandis of Leith at ten hours\r\n    before none, and their sall thai have and fynd Botis reddie in the\r\n    havin ordanit to them be the Officeris of this bur{t}, reddely\r\n    furneist with victuals, to have thame to the _Inche_ [the island of\r\n    Inch Keith in the Firth of Forth], and thair to remane quhill God\r\n    proviyd for thair Health: And that all uther personis the quilks taks\r\n    upon thame to hale the said contagious infirmitie and taks the cure\r\n    thairof, that they devoyd and pass with thame, sua that nane of thair\r\n    personis quhilks taks sic cure upon thame use the samyn cure within\r\n    this bur{t} in pns nor peirt any manner of way. And wha sa be is\r\n    foundin infectit and not passand to the _Inche_, as said is, be\r\n    _Mononday_ at the Sone ganging to, and in lykways the said personis\r\n    that takis the sd Cure of sanitie upon thame gif they will use the\r\n    samyn, thai and ilk ane of thame salle be brynt on the cheik with the\r\n    marking Irne that thai may be kennit in tym to cum, and thairafter gif\r\n    any of tham remains, that thai sall be banist but favors[832].”\r\n\r\nSir James Simpson, with his indefatigable research over antiquarian\r\npoints[833], has brought together evidence of payments from the king’s\r\npurse to persons infected with the “Grantgore” at Dalry, Ayrshire, in\r\nSeptember, 1497, at Linlithgow on 2nd October, 1497, at Stirling on the\r\n21st February, 1498 (“at the tounne end of Strivelin to the seke folk in\r\nthe grantgore”), at Glasgow (also “at the tounn end”) on 22nd February,\r\n1498, and again at Linlithgow, 11th April, 1498. He quotes also from a\r\npoem of William Dunbar, written soon after 1500, on the conduct of the\r\nQueen’s men on Fastern’s e’en, the terms “pockis” and “Spanyie pockis.”\r\nFrom Sir David Lyndsay’s poems, of much later date, and from other\r\nreferences, he makes out that “grandgore” or “glengore” was the usual name\r\nin Scotland down to the 17th century. Grandgore means _à la grande gorre_,\r\nwhich is the same as _à la grande mode_. This name was given for a time in\r\nFrance to the great disease of the day, but it was soon superseded by\r\n_vérole_. Scotland is the only country where “grandgore” became\r\nestablished as the common name of the pox.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Scots evidence, two other ordinances may be quoted\r\nfrom the town council records of Aberdeen. In a long list of regulations\r\nunder date the 8th October, 1507, there occur these two[834]:--\r\n\r\n    “Item, that diligent inquisitioun be takin of all infect personis with\r\n    this strange seiknes of Nappillis, for the sauetie of the town; and\r\n    the personis beand infectit therwith be chargit to keip thame in ther\r\n    howssis and uther places, fra the haile folkis.”\r\n\r\n    “Item, that nayne infectit folkis with the seiknes of Napillis be\r\n    haldin at the common fleschouss, or with the fleschouris, baxteris,\r\n    brousteris, ladinaris, for sauete of the toun, and the personis\r\n    infectit sall keip thame quyat in thar housis, zhardis, or uther comat\r\n    placis, quhill thai be haill for the infectioun of the nichtbouris.”\r\n\r\n“Sickness of Naples” is a reference to the well-known diffusion of the\r\ndisease all over Europe by the mercenaries of Charles VIII. of France,\r\ndispersing after the Italian war and the occupation of Naples.\r\n\r\nFor England the first known mention of the pox is several years later than\r\nthe Scots references, although that proves nothing as to its actual\r\nbeginning in epidemic form. In the book of the Privy Purse Expenses of\r\nElizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII., there is an entry under the date\r\nof March 15, 1503, of a sum of forty shillings paid on behalf of John\r\nPertriche “oon of the sonnes of mad Beale;” which sum appears to have been\r\nwhat the youth cost her majesty for board, clothes, education, and\r\nincidental expenses, during the year past. The various items making up the\r\nsum of forty shillings are: his diets “for a year ending Christmas last\r\npast,” a cloth gown, a fustian coat, shirts, shoes and hose, “item, for\r\nhis learning, 20_d._ item for a prymer and saulter 20_d._ And payed to a\r\nsurgeon which heled him of the Frenche pox 20_s._ Sm̅{a.} 40_s._” It will\r\nbe observed that the surgeon’s bill was as much as all his other expenses\r\nfor the year together[835].\r\n\r\nThe London chronicler of the time is alderman Robert Fabyan; but although\r\nFabyan, writing in the first years of the 16th century, uses the word\r\n“pockys” to designate an illness of Edward IV. during a military\r\nexcursion to the Scots Marches in 1463, or long before the epidemic\r\ninvasion from the south of Europe, he says nothing of that great event\r\nitself. There is a record, however, of one significant measure taken in\r\nthe year 1506, the suppression of the stews on the Bankside in Southwark.\r\nThese resorts were of ancient date, and for long paid toll to the bishop\r\nof Winchester. In 1506 there were eighteen of them in a row along the\r\nSurrey side of the river, a little above London Bridge; they were wooden\r\nerections, each with a stair down to the water, and each with its river\r\nfront painted with a sign like a tavern, such as the Boar’s Head, the\r\nCross Keys, the Gun, the Castle, the Crane, the Cardinal’s Hat, the Bell,\r\nthe Swan, etc. These houses, says Stow, were inhibited in the year 1506,\r\nand the doors closed up; but it was not long ere they were set open again,\r\nthe number being at the same time restricted to twelve[836]. They had been\r\nsuppressed once before, at the earnest demand of the citizens, in the\r\nreign of Henry IV., and it appears from a sermon of Latimer’s that they\r\nwere again suppressed about the year 1546. Thus Shakespeare had several\r\nprecedents in London for the situation which he creates in a foreign city,\r\nin _Measure for Measure_.\r\n\r\nThe next reference that I find to it is an oblique one, by Bernard André\r\nin his _Annals of Henry VII._ On the occasion of mentioning the sweating\r\nsickness of 1508, he says the latter disease occurred first in England\r\nabout four-and-twenty years before, and that it was “followed by a far\r\nmore detestable malady, to be abhorred as much as leprosy, a wasting pox\r\nwhich still vexes many eminent men” (“multos adhuc vexat egregios alioquin\r\nviros tabifica lues[837]”). Bernard André’s association of the pox with\r\nthe sweating sickness, as of one new disease following another, is in the\r\nsame manner as the reference to it by Erasmus. In a letter from Basle, in\r\nAugust, 1525, to Schiedlowitz, chancellor of Poland, he discourses upon\r\nthe sickliness of seasons and the mutations of diseases[838]: Until\r\nthirty years ago England was unacquainted with the sweat, nor did that\r\nmalady go beyond the bounds of the island. In their own experience they\r\nhad seen mutations:--“nunc pestilentiae, nunc anginae, nunc tusses; sed\r\nmorbum morbus, velut ansam ansa trahit; nec facilé cedunt ubi semel\r\nincubuere.” He then proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “But if one were to seek among the diseases of the body for that which\r\n    ought to be awarded the first place, it seems to my judgment that it\r\n    is due to that evil, of uncertain origin, which has now been for so\r\n    many years raging with impunity in all countries of the world, but has\r\n    not yet found a definite name. Most persons call it the French pox\r\n    (_Poscas Galleas_), some the Spanish. What sickness has ever traversed\r\n    every part of Europe, Africa and Asia with equal speed? What clings\r\n    more tenaciously, what repels more vigorously the art and care of\r\n    physicians? What passes more easily by contagion to another? What\r\n    brings more cruel tortures? Vitiligo and lichens are deformities of\r\n    the skin, but they are curable. This lues, however, is a foul, cruel,\r\n    contagious disease, dangerous to life, apt to remain in the system and\r\n    to break out anew not otherwise than the gout.”\r\n\r\nWhether it was from some mistaken theory of contagiousness or for other\r\nreasons, a fellow of Merton was ordered to leave in 1511 because he had\r\nthe French pox[839]. In the English history nothing appears above the\r\nsurface until the beginning of the movement against the papal supremacy\r\nand in favour of Reformation. That was a time of public accusations of all\r\nkinds, and among the rest of opprobrious references to the pox. In Simon\r\nFish’s _Supplication of Beggars_[840], which was written in 1524, certain\r\npriests are thus hyperbolically spoken of:\r\n\r\n    “These be they that have made an hundred thousande ydel hores in your\r\n    realme, which wold have gotten theyr lyvinge honestly in the swete of\r\n    their faces had not there superfluous riches illected them to uncleane\r\n    lust and ydelnesse. These be they that corrupte the hole generation of\r\n    mankynd in your realme, that catch the pockes of one woman and beare\r\n    it to another, ye some one of them will boste amonge his felowes that\r\n    he hath medled with an hundreth wymen.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1529, there is a more painful and most undignified charge. In\r\nthe Articles of Arraignment of Wolsey in the House of Peers, the sixth\r\ncharge is:\r\n\r\n    “The same Lord Cardinall, knowing himself to have the foul and\r\n    contagious disease of the great pox, broken out upon him in divers\r\n    places of his body, came daily to your Grace [the King], rowning in\r\n    your ear, and blowing upon your most noble Grace with his perilous and\r\n    infective breath, to the marvellous danger of your Highness, if God of\r\n    his infinite goodness had not better provided for your Highness. And\r\n    when he was once healed of them, he made your Grace believe that his\r\n    disease was an impostume in his head, and of none other thing[841].”\r\n\r\nAmong the glimpses of contemporary manners in Bullein’s _Dialogue of the\r\nFever Pestilence_ (1564), there is one referring to the pox; Roger, the\r\ngroom, soliloquizes thus: “her first husband was prentice with James\r\nElles, and of him learned to play at the short-knife and the horn thimble.\r\nBut these dog-tricks will bring one to the poxe, the gallows, or to the\r\ndevil[842].” Bullein, in his more systematic handbook to health, promises\r\nto treat of the pox fully, but omits to do so. In one place he refers to\r\nthe wounds of a young man who fell into a deep coal-pit at Newcastle as\r\nhaving been healed “by an auncient practisour called Mighel, a Frencheman,\r\nwhiche also is cunnynge to helpe his owne countrey disease that now is to\r\ncommonly knowen here in England, the more to be lamented: But yet dayly\r\nincreased, whereof I entinde to speake in the place of the Poxe.” But the\r\nonly other reference is (in the section on the “Use of Sicke Men and\r\nMedicine,”) to certain drugs “which have vertue to cleanse scabbes, iche,\r\npox. I saie the pox, as by experience we se there is no better remedy than\r\nsweatyng and the drinkyng of guaiacum,” etc[843].\r\n\r\nA good instance of the oblique mode of reference to the malady occurs in\r\nanother dialogue by a surgeon, Thomas Gale[844]. The pupil who is being\r\ninstructed tables the subject of “the morbus,” which he farther speaks of\r\nas “a great scabbe;” whereupon Gale pointedly takes him to task for the\r\naffectation of “the morbus;” any disease, he says, is the morbus; what you\r\nmean is the morbus Gallicus.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date, 1563, a casual reference is made to the wide\r\nprevalence of the pox by John Jones in his _Dyall of Agues_. In\r\nillustration of the fact that various countries originate different forms\r\nof pestilence, as the Egyptians the leprosy, the Attics the joint-ache,\r\nthe Arabians swellings of the throat and flanks, and the English the\r\nsweating sickness, he instances farther, “the Neapolitans, or rather the\r\nbesiegers of Naples, with the pockes, spread hence to far abroad through\r\nall the parts of Europe, no kingdom that I have been in free--the more\r\npity[845].”\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Writings on the Pox in the 16th Century.\r\n\r\nThe first original English writer on the pox was William Clowes. In his\r\ntreatise[846] of 1579, dedicated to the Society of the Barbers and\r\nChirurgions, he says that he had been bold “three years since to offer\r\nunto you a very small and imperfect treatise of mine touching the cure of\r\nthe disease called in Latine _Morbus Gallicus_, the which, forasmuch as it\r\nwas at that time rather wrested from me by the importunitye of some of my\r\nfrendes, upon certain occasions then moving, than willingly of my selfe\r\npublished, it passed out of my handes so sodeinly and with so small\r\noverlooking or correction,” that he now in 1579 reissues it in a revised\r\nand corrected form.\r\n\r\n    “The Morbus Gallicus or Morbus Neapolitanus, but more properly Lues\r\n    Venera, that is the pestilent infection of filthy lust, and termed for\r\n    the most part in English the French Pocks, a sicknes very lothsome,\r\n    odious, troublesome and daungerous, which spreadeth itself throughout\r\n    all England and overfloweth as I thinke the whole world.” He then\r\n    characterises the vice “that is the original cause of this infection,\r\n    that breedeth it, that nurseth it, that disperseth it.” In the cure\r\n    of the malady he has had some reasonable experience, and no small\r\n    practice for many years. According to the following passage, St\r\n    Bartholomew’s Hospital, to which Clowes was surgeon, was three parts\r\n    occupied by patients suffering from this malady:--\r\n\r\n    “It is wonderfull to consider how huge multitudes there be of such as\r\n    be infected with it, and that dayly increase, to the great daunger of\r\n    the common wealth, and the stayne of the whole nation: the cause\r\n    whereof I see none so great as the licentious and beastly disorder of\r\n    a great number of rogues and vagabondes: The filthye lyfe of many lewd\r\n    and idell persons, both men and women, about the citye of London, and\r\n    the great number of lewd alehouses, which are the very nests and\r\n    harbourers of such filthy creatures; By meanes of which disordered\r\n    persons some other of better disposition are many tymes infected, and\r\n    many more lyke to be, except there be some speedy remedy provided for\r\n    the same. I may speake boldely, because I speake truely: and yet I\r\n    speake it with very griefe of hart. In the Hospitall of Saint\r\n    Bartholomew in London, there hath bene cured of this disease by me,\r\n    and three (3) others, within this fyve yeares, to the number of one\r\n    thousand and more. I speake nothing of Saint Thomas Hospital and other\r\n    howses about this Citye, wherein an infinite multitude are dayly in\r\n    cure.... For it hapneth in the house of Saint Bartholomew very seldome\r\n    but that among every twentye diseased persons that are taken in,\r\n    fiftene of them have the pocks.” Like the earlier writers on the\r\n    Continent he recognizes that the disease is communicated in more ways\r\n    than one; he speaks of “good poor people that be infected by unwary\r\n    eating or drinking or keeping company with those lewd beasts, and\r\n    which either for shame will not bewray it, or for lack of good\r\n    chirurgions know not how to remedy it, or for lack of ability are not\r\n    able otherwise to provide for the cure of it.”\r\n\r\nIn so far as Clowes follows his own experience, he is under no illusion as\r\nto the nature and circumstances of the French pox. But he goes on to\r\nappend a pathology of the disease, which is taken from foreign writers and\r\nreflects the bewilderment of the faculty over the constitutional effects\r\nof the malady. As Erasmus said, in the letter quoted, it went all through\r\nthe body, “not otherwise than the gout.” When it was first observed, it\r\nappeared to be constitutional from the outset. More particularly it\r\ncovered the skin with “pustules” or “whelks” as if it had been a primary\r\neruption like variola, to which it was compared; hence the names “great\r\npox” and “small pox.” It was not until long after that our present\r\npathology of primary, secondary and tertiary effects was worked out; in\r\nthe earliest writings the constitutional effects were referred to an\r\n“inward cause,” as Clowes says, to some idiopathic corruption of the\r\nhumours having the liver for their place of elaboration, or _minera\r\nmorbi_. Thus the learned explanation of the malady, which Clowes adopts\r\nfrom foreign writers more skilled than himself in such disquisitions, has\r\nno organic unity with his own common-sense observations. In his _Proved\r\nPractice_ he defers still farther to the academical view, as given in the\r\ntreatise of John Almenar, a Spanish physician[847].\r\n\r\nAlthough Clowes, in 1579, testifies to the very wide prevalence of the\r\ndisease, to so great an extent, indeed, that it occupied the hospitals\r\nmore than all other diseases put together, yet there is reason to think\r\nthat it had by that time lost the terrible severity of its original\r\nepidemic type. The usual statement is that the disease abated both in\r\nextent and in intensity within twenty or thirty years of the Italian\r\noutbreak among the soldiery in 1494-96. A contemporary and ally of Clowes,\r\nJohn Read, of Gloucester, published in 1588 a volume of translations, from\r\nthe Latin manuscript of the English surgeon of the 14th century, John\r\nArdern, on the cure of fistulas, and from the treatise on wounds, etc. by\r\nthe Spanish surgeon Arcaeus (Antwerp, 1574)[848]. In the latter he finds\r\nthe following passage, which seems to describe the _morbus Gallicus_ on\r\nits first appearance:--\r\n\r\n    “The French disease did bring with it a kind of universal skabbe,\r\n    oftentimes with ring wormes, with the foulness of all the body called\r\n    vitiligo and alopecia, running sores in the head called acores, and\r\n    werts of both sortes, and many times with flegmatic or melancholic\r\n    swellings or ulcers corrosive, filthie and cancrouse, and also running\r\n    over the body, together with putrifying of the bone, and many times\r\n    also accompanied with all kind of grief, with fevers, consumptions,\r\n    and with many other differences of diseases.”\r\n\r\nRead’s own remarks draw an explicit contrast between the disease on its\r\nfirst appearance and in his own later experience. Everyone knows now, he\r\nsays, how to treat the French pox, “the disease daylie dying and wearing\r\naway by the exquisite cure thereof”--which may be taken to mean, at least,\r\na notable mitigation of the constitutional effects[849]. The treatment,\r\nhowever, must have been much less effective then than now. Clowes speaks\r\nof a class who “either for shame will not bewray it, or for lack of good\r\nchirurgions know not how to remedy it, or for lack of ability are not able\r\notherwise to provide for the cure of it.” The expense of a cure would have\r\nbeen considerable, to judge by the case given above from an account-book\r\nof the year 1503. Unable to employ “good chirurgions,” the poorer class\r\nwould resort to quacks, of whose practice, in that and other diseases, we\r\nhave some glimpses both from Clowes in London and from Read in Gloucester\r\nand Bristol. Of one irregular practitioner Clowes says, “He did compound\r\nfor fifteen pound to rid him within three fits of his ague, and to make\r\nhim as whole as a fish of all diseases.” There was still a lower order of\r\nempirics, whom Clowes disdained to contend with:\r\n\r\n    “Yet I do not mean to speak of the old woman at Newington, beyond St\r\n    George’s Fields, unto whom the people do resort as unto an oracle;\r\n    neither will I speak of the woman on the Bankside, who is as cunning\r\n    as the horse at the Cross Keys; nor yet of the cunning woman in\r\n    Seacole Lane, who hath more skill in her cole-basket than judgment in\r\n    urine, or knowledge in physic or surgery”--nor of many others who are\r\n    compared to “moths in clothes,” to “canker,” and to “rust in iron.”\r\n\r\nRead gives an account of a travelling mountebank, which is too graphic to\r\nbe omitted:\r\n\r\n    “In this year, 1587, there came a Fleming into the city of Glocester\r\n    named Woolfgange Frolicke, and there hanging forth his pictures, his\r\n    flags, his instruments, and his letters of mart with long lybells,\r\n    great tossells, broad scales closed in boxes, with such counterfeit\r\n    shows and knacks of knavery, cozening the people of their money,\r\n    without either learning or knowledge. And yet for money got him a\r\n    licence to practise at Bristow. But when he came to Gloceter, and\r\n    being called before some being in authority by myself and others, he\r\n    was not able to answer to any one point in chirurgerie; which being\r\n    perceived, and the man known, the matter was excused by way of\r\n    charity, to be good to straungers.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most systematic and detailed surgical treatises of the time,\r\nJohn Banister’s book on the “general and particular curation of ulcers”\r\n(1575), is significant for the indirect way in which it refers to the lues\r\nvenerea.\r\n\r\n    Thus at folio 25, “the malignant ulcer called cacoethes” is described\r\n    without anything said of a venereal origin, but the specific guaiacum\r\n    is given among the remedies. The same is the ease on the 31st and 32nd\r\n    leaves, which treat of “filthie and putrefied ulcers,” guaiacum being\r\n    again prescribed. At folio 51, on ulcers of the mouth, it is said, “If\r\n    it proceed a morbo venereo, then first begin with due purgation, and\r\n    prescribe the party a thin diet with the decoction of guaiacum, and\r\n    use ointments requisite for that disease, strengthening the inner\r\n    parts. Use twice a day a sublimated water, as is afore written, to\r\n    touch the ulcer with lint rolled therein:\r\n\r\n        Rec. Aqua Rosar.} an. two\r\n              & Plantag.} ounces,\r\n             Sublimati i dragme.\r\n\r\n    Boil them in a glass bottel till the sublimate be dissolved.”\r\n\r\n    On fol. 57, he describes “ulcers of the privie parts,” among which are\r\n    corroding ulcers, but without reference to the lues. It is in the\r\n    section headed, “To prepare the humours” (fol. 61) that the most\r\n    explicit reference occurs: “When the ulcers proceed through the French\r\n    pockes, a thinne diet must be used, with the decoction of guaiacum or\r\n    use universall unctions ex Hydrargyro[850].”\r\n\r\nIn 1596 there appeared Peter Lowe’s essay on _The Spanish Sickness_[851],\r\nwhich is purely a product of experience abroad, his own or of others, and\r\nis mainly doctrinal or theoretical. The other properly English works on\r\nthe subject are all subsequent to the Restoration, and do not come into\r\nthe period of this volume, nor, from an epidemiological point of view,\r\ninto this work at all.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to the wide prevalence of the pox in high and low becomes\r\nabundant in the writings and memorials of the reign of James I. The\r\neffects of the disease, as they would have been commonly remarked at this\r\nperiod, are summed up in a well-known passage in _Timon of Athens_. It\r\nwould serve no purpose to collect the numerous references from Puritan\r\nsermons, moral and descriptive essays, plays, and letters of the time. An\r\nanonymous work of the year 1652 actually couples “the plague and the pox,”\r\nand shows “how to cure those which are infected with either of them[852].”\r\nOne more piece of evidence may be given for London in the year 1662, or\r\nthe beginning of the Restoration period,--a date which brings us down a\r\ncentury and a half from the epidemic invasion with which we are more\r\nimmediately concerned; but the information for 1662 will serve to show how\r\nthe existence of the disease was still viewed _sub rosa_, and it may help\r\none to realize what its prevalence and its serious effects on the public\r\nhealth must have been continuously in the generations before, and most of\r\nall in the generation which experienced the full force of it as an\r\nepidemic[853].\r\n\r\nThe London bills of mortality, setting forth the several causes of death,\r\nwere first printed in 1629. The entry of the French pox is in them from\r\nthe beginning, and the annual total of deaths set down to it is\r\nconsiderable, approaching a hundred in the year. But according to Graunt,\r\nwho made the bills of mortality the subject of a critical study in\r\n1662[854], they were defective or incorrect in their returns of deaths due\r\nto the pox:--\r\n\r\n    “By the ordinary discourse of the world, it seems a great part of men\r\n    have, at one time or other, had some species of this disease ...\r\n    whereof many complained so fiercely, etc.” He then explains, with\r\n    reference to the deaths entered as due to it in the bills of\r\n    mortality: “All mentioned to die of the French pox were returned by\r\n    the clerks of St Giles’ and St Martin’s in the Fields only, in which\r\n    place I understand that most of the vilest and most miserable houses\r\n    of uncleanness were; from whence I concluded that only _hated_\r\n    persons, and such whose very noses were eaten off were reported by the\r\n    searchers to have died of this too frequent malady”--the rest having\r\n    been included under the head of consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Epidemic of 1494.\r\n\r\nThe French pox, as it was called in England (also the great pox and simply\r\nthe pox), or the Spanish pox, as it was called in France, or the sickness\r\nof Naples, or the grandgore, is one of the epidemic diseases concerning\r\nwhich it seems fitting to say something of the antecedents, in addition to\r\nwhat has been said of its arrival as an epidemic in this country, and of\r\nits prevalence therein. But this will have to be said very briefly, and\r\nwithout entering upon the pathology or ultimate nature of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe numerous foreign writings upon it during the first years of its spread\r\nover Europe are all singularly at a loss to account for its origin. One of\r\nthe earlier guesses was that it arose out of leprosy, as if a graft or\r\nmodification of that medieval disease, replacing it among the maladies of\r\nthe people. The occasion of that hypothesis seems to have been the lax\r\ndiagnosis of leprosy itself, a laxity which goes as far back as Bernard\r\nGordonio and Gilbert, if not farther back. Many things were called _lepra_\r\nwhich were not elephantiasis Graecorum, and among those things the lues\r\nvenerea in the Middle Ages was undoubtedly included. At a time when true\r\nleprosy was disappearing or had already disappeared from Europe, a new\r\nform of disease, which came suddenly into universal notice although by no\r\nmeans then first into existence, seemed to be the successor of leprosy,\r\nevoked out of it, and even caught from the leprous by contagion. That is\r\nthe view of Manardus, in a passage quoted in the sequel,--that syphilis\r\nbegan in certain most particular circumstances at Valencia, in Spain, the\r\nsource of all the subsequent contamination of Europe having been a certain\r\nsoldier of fortune who was _elephantiosus_ or leprous. In the infancy of a\r\nscience it is natural to assign to some such single and definite source a\r\nnew phenomenon which was really called forth by a concurrence of\r\ncauses[855].\r\n\r\nAnother guess of the same kind was the famous theory, which found a truly\r\nlearned defender in Astruc last century and has had supporters more\r\nrecently, that the lues venerea came from the New World with the returning\r\nships of Columbus. There never was any considerable body of facts,\r\nconsistent as regards times and places, in support of that theory; and, on\r\nantecedent grounds, the objection to it was that it is as difficult, to\r\nsay the least, to conceive of the origin of such a disease among the\r\nsavages of Hispaniola as among the natives of Europe. “Here or nowhere is\r\nAmerica” is the proper retort to all such visionary theories put upon the\r\ndistant and the unknown. The American theory is now hopelessly dead; the\r\nmore that the New World became known, the less did syphilis appear to be\r\nindigenous to it: indeed the disease followed the track of Europeans, and\r\nthose parts of the American continent, north and south of the Isthmus,\r\nwhich were longest in being reached by the civilisation of the Old World,\r\nwere also longest in being reached by the lues venerea[856].\r\n\r\nThe name “sickness of Naples,” which occurs in the Aberdeen records as\r\nearly as 1507, indicates the common opinion of the laity as to the origin\r\nand means of diffusion of the strange malady. In the passage above quoted\r\nfrom Jones’s _Dyall of Agues_, it will be seen that he refers it to “the\r\nbesiegers of Naples.” The besiegers of Naples were the mercenaries of\r\nCharles VIII. occupying it in the beginning of the year 1495, although\r\nthere was no real siege. The new disease was at the time, rightly or\r\nwrongly, traced to them while they occupied Italy, and its diffusion over\r\nEurope was justly traced to their dispersion to their several countries at\r\nthe end of the campaign. There is medical testimony that the malady\r\nappeared in 1495 among the Venetian and Milanese troops which were banded\r\nagainst Charles VIII. at the siege of Novara. Marcellus Cumanus, of\r\nVenice, who was surgeon to the forces, thus speaks of the event, in\r\ncertain _Observationes de Lue Venerea_ which he wrote on the margin of\r\nArgelata’s work on Surgery[857]:\r\n\r\n    “In Italy, in the year 1495, owing to celestial influences, I have\r\n    myself seen, and do testify that, while I was in the camp at Novara\r\n    with the troops of the Lords of Venice and of the Lords of Milan, many\r\n    knights and foot-soldiers suffered from an ebullition of the humours,\r\n    producing many pustules in the face and through the whole body; which\r\n    pustules commonly began under the prepuce or without the prepuce, like\r\n    a grain of millet-seed, or upon the glans, attended by considerable\r\n    itching. Sometimes a single pustule began like a small vesicle without\r\n    pain, but with itching. Being broken by rubbing, they ulcerated like a\r\n    corrosive _formica_, and a few days after, troubles began from pains\r\n    in the arms, legs and feet, with great pustules. All the skilled\r\n    physicians had difficulty in curing them.... Without medicines, the\r\n    pustules upon the body lasted a year or more, like a leprous variola.”\r\n    He then gives many other details of symptoms and treatment.\r\n\r\nFor the year after, 1496, two German writers, who were not surgeons but\r\noccupied with affairs of state, Sebastian Brant (author of the _Ship of\r\nFools_) and Joseph Grünbeck, have described the disease, apparently in\r\nconnexion with the troops serving in Italy under Maximilian I. against the\r\ninvading army of Charles VIII. Thus, there is sufficient evidence that the\r\nmalady in its first two or three years of epidemic prevalence, was\r\nassociated with a state of war on Italian soil, in the persons of French\r\ntroops (and mercenaries of all nations), of Venetian and Milanese troops,\r\nand of the German troops of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nBut the German writers are clear that the disease did not originate on\r\nItalian soil, at the siege of Naples or elsewhere. Thus Brant in his poem\r\nof 1496 assigns to it an origin in France, and a dispersion within a year\r\nor two over all Europe[858]:\r\n\r\n  “Pestiferum in Lygures transvexit Francia morbum,\r\n   Quem _mala de Franzos_ Romula lingua vocat.\r\n   Hic Latium atque Italos invasit, ab Alpibus extra\r\n   Serpens, Germanos Istricolasque premit;\r\n   Grassatur mediis jam Thracibus atque Bohemis\r\n   Et morbi genus id Sarmata quisque timet.\r\n   Nec satis extremo tutantur in orbe Britanni\r\n   Quos refluum cingit succiduumque fretum.\r\n   Quin etiam fama est, Aphros penetrasse Getasque\r\n   Vigue sua utrumque depopulare polum.”\r\n\r\nGrünbeck, who wrote briefly on the disease in 1496, returned to the\r\nsubject at much greater length in 1503, when he was secretary to the\r\nEmperor Maximilian, his later treatise, _De Mentulagra, alias Morbo\r\nGallico_, being, indeed, among the best that the epidemic called forth.\r\nHensler doubts whether Grünbeck was himself in Italy, so as to observe the\r\nravages of the disease among the troops of the Emperor (including\r\nVenetians and Milanese) at the sieges of Pisa and Leghorn in the summer of\r\n1496, and among the opposing troops of Charles VIII. Be that as it may,\r\nthe following is from Grünbeck’s description[859]:\r\n\r\n    “O! quid unquam terribilius et abominabilius humanis sensibus\r\n    occurrit! Difficile est dictu, creditu fere impossibile, quanta\r\n    foeditatis, putredinis et sordium colluvione, quantisque dolorum\r\n    anxietatibus nonnullorum militum corpora involuerit. Aliqui etiam a\r\n    vertice ad usque genua quodam horrido, squalido, continuo, foedo et\r\n    nigro _scabiei_ genere, nulla parte faciei, (solis oculis exemtis),\r\n    nec colli, cervicis, pectoris vel pubis immuni relicta, percussi, ita\r\n    sordidi abominabilesque effecti sunt, qui ab omnibus commilitonibus\r\n    derelicti, ac etiam in plano et nudo campo sub dio emarescentes, nihil\r\n    magis quam _mortem_ expetiverunt.... At his omnibus nihil vel parum\r\n    proficientibus, et morbo ipso non contento hoc hominum numero, ut eos\r\n    solos tantis passionum cruciatibus afficeret, venenum contagiosum in\r\n    multos spectantes Italos, Teutones, Helveticos, Vindelicos, Rhaetos,\r\n    Noricos, Batavos, Morinos, Anglicos, Hispanos, et alios quos belli\r\n    occasio in copias conscripserat, transfudit.... Interea temporis, per\r\n    clandestinam Gallorum abitionem, exercitus fuerunt\r\n    dissoluti,”--Grünbeck himself proceeding with some merchants to\r\n    Hungary and thence to Poland[860].\r\n\r\nHow came this terrible infection to be among the troops of all nations on\r\nItalian soil in the years 1494, 1495 and 1496? Sebastian Brant clearly\r\nstates that the French brought it with them, and that it spread first over\r\nLiguria. Grünbeck says that it was seen _primo super Insubriam_, or the\r\nMilanese, on which it rested like a dense cloud, until it was scattered by\r\nthe winds over the whole of Liguria, and so found its way into the armies\r\nin Italy. Beniveni, of Florence, who wrote in 1498, says that it came to\r\nItaly from Spain, and from Italy was carried to France. Thus we have a\r\ntheory of a Spanish origin, of a French origin, and perhaps also of a\r\nnative Italian origin--all agreeing that Italy during the state of war\r\nfrom 1494 to 1496 was the theatre of its first ravages on the great scale,\r\nand the source from which the disease was brought to all the countries of\r\nEurope by the returning soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the difficulty is to be looked for in the inquiries after\r\nstill earlier notices of the _lues venerea_. It is beyond the purpose of\r\nthis book to enter upon that large subject, farther than has already been\r\ndone with the object of proving the generic use of the medieval term\r\n_lepra_. It is now accepted by competent students of medical history that\r\nthe same disease, with all varieties or modes of primary, secondary or\r\ntertiary, existed in antiquity and in the Middle Ages, although\r\nsecondaries and tertiaries may not have been ascribed to their primary\r\nsource. But what specially concerns us here is the question whether the\r\nmalady was anywhere beginning to be more noticeable in the years\r\nimmediately preceding the great military explosion on Italian soil. On\r\nthat point there is some evidence from more than one source, that the\r\nmalady was sufficiently prevalent in the south of France to be a subject\r\nof remark previous to the French expedition to Italy, that it had found\r\nits way to the ports of Spain (Barcelona and Valencia), and that the\r\ntroops of Charles VIII., if not also that youthful monarch himself,\r\ncarried it across the Alps into Liguria, and so gave it that start on\r\nItalian soil which the state of war for the next two years raised to the\r\npower of a virulent and diffusive epidemic[861].\r\n\r\nThe best piece of evidence of its prevalence in Languedoc and its\r\nspreading thence to the adjoining coast of Spain is found in a letter of\r\nthe 18th April, 1494 (four months before Charles VIII. entered Italy),\r\nwritten by Nicolas Scyllatius just after arriving at Barcelona[862]. The\r\nprovince of Narbonne, he says, a part of France adjoining Spain, now sent\r\nforth another vice. Women felt it most; it infected neighbours by contact;\r\nit has lately invaded Spain, hitherto untouched by it. “I was horrified,”\r\nhe continues, “on first landing at Barcelona; for I met with many of the\r\ninhabitants who were seized by that contagion. On my inquiring of the\r\nphysicians (for with these I held converse during nearly all that\r\njourney), they assured me that the new _lues_ had been derived from\r\ntruculent France.” In keeping with this entirely credible testimony is the\r\nstatement of Torella, a native of Valencia, who wrote one of the earlier\r\nessays on the new disease (“De Pudendagra”) in November, 1497. The disease\r\nfirst broke out, he says, in Auvergne in 1493 (incepit, ut aiunt, haec\r\nmaligna aegritudo anno 1493 in Alervnia), and so came in the way of\r\ncontagion to Spain and the Islands [to Sardinia, where he was bishop, and\r\nto Corsica], and to Italy, creeping in the end over all Europe, and, if\r\none may so speak, over the whole globe[863].\r\n\r\nTorella thus confirms the Barcelona traveller so far as regards\r\nimportations from the south of France to the neighbouring ports, the\r\nformer writer naming Auvergne as the endemic seat of the malady, whereas\r\nthe latter gives Narbonne. Another piece of evidence, that the pox was in\r\nValencia, as well as in Barcelona, before the expedition of Charles VIII.,\r\nis found in a story told by Manardus of Ferrara (1500), a story which is\r\nwholly improbable so far as concerns the origin of syphilis, at a stated\r\ntime and place, out of a case of leprosy, but is entirely credible so far\r\nas regards the grossness of its circumstances:\r\n\r\n    “Coepisse hunc morbum per id tempus, dicunt, quo Carolus, Francorum\r\n    rex, expeditionem Italicam parabat: coepisse, autem, in Valentia,\r\n    Hispaniae Taraconensis insigni civitate, a nobili quodam scorto, cujus\r\n    noctem elephantiosus quidam, ex equestri ordine miles, quinquaginta\r\n    aureis emit; et cum ad mulieris concubitum frequens juventus\r\n    accurreret, intra paucos dies supra quadringentos infectos; e quorum\r\n    numero nonnulli, Carolum Italiam petentem sequuti, praeter alia quae\r\n    adhuc vigent importata mala et hoc addiderunt[864].”\r\n\r\nThe evidence that follows is not so explicit, but it has strong\r\nprobability. The progress of Charles VIII. from France to Italy in the\r\nautumn of 1494 has been told by Philip de Comines in his _Cronique du Roy\r\nCharles VIII._, first printed at Paris in 1528, nineteen years after the\r\nauthor’s death. De Comines accompanied his master, the French king, as far\r\nas Asti; he was then sent on a mission to Venice, and rejoined the king at\r\nFlorence. But De Comines, who was no gossip, omits one interesting fact\r\nnear the beginning of the journey to Italy, which has been preserved for\r\nus in a contemporary work (1503) called _La Cronique Martiniane_, or\r\nchronicle of all the popes down to Alexander Borgia lately deceased[865].\r\nThis chronicle relates as follows concerning Charles VIII.’s journey:--“Il\r\nse arresta premierement aucuns jours a Lyon, doubteux s’il passeroit les\r\nmons, car il y estoit detenu pour les delices et plaisances de la cité et\r\npour les folles amours de aucunes gorrieres lyonnoises. Mais quant l’air\r\ndevint pestilent, il s’en tyra à Vienne, citè de Daulphinè.” His great\r\narmy had already passed the Alps and arrived in the country of Asti: it is\r\nsaid to have consisted, in round numbers, of 3600 men-at-arms, 6000\r\nbowmen, 8000 pikemen, and 8000 with arquebuses, halberds, two-handed\r\nswords, or other arms, together with a heavy artillery train of 8000\r\nhorses. A large part of this force were Swiss; another part were\r\nGascons[866].\r\n\r\nCharles VIII. left Vienne on the 23rd of August, and crossed Mont Genèvre\r\non the 2nd September, whence he proceeded direct by Susa and Turin,\r\njoining his army at Asti on September 9. At Asti, says De Comines, he had\r\nan illness, which caused that minister to delay setting out on his mission\r\nto Venice for a few days. The original printed text of De Comines’\r\n_Chronique_ (Paris, 1528), says that the author remained at Asti a few\r\ndays longer “because the king was ill of the smallpox (_de la petite\r\nverolle_) and in peril of death, for that the fever was mixed therewith;\r\nbut it lasted only six or seven days, and I set out upon my way.” The next\r\nedition has no change but “in great peril of death” (_en grant peril de\r\nmort_), instead of merely “in peril.” Now, where did this diagnosis of\r\n_petite verolle_ come from? Nothing is said of smallpox being prevalent at\r\nthe time among the troops or along their route. The name _petite verolle_\r\nitself did not exist in 1494; it came into existence with _grosse\r\nverolle_, having being made necessary by the latter; and the first that we\r\nhear of _grosse verolle_ is when the Italian campaign was over and the pox\r\nwas raging in Paris, the Parlement of Paris, on the 6th of March, 1497,\r\nhaving made an ordinance against a certain contagious malady “nommée la\r\n_grosse verole_,” which had been in the kingdom and in the city of Paris\r\nsince two years. Probably Comines deliberately wrote “_petite verolle_” in\r\nhis manuscript, having composed the latter subsequent to 1498, or at a\r\ntime when the terms _verolle_, or _grosse verolle_, and _petite verolle_,\r\nwere passing current and were known in their respective senses. The causes\r\nor circumstances of the king’s malady at Asti are not enlarged upon by De\r\nComines, farther than that he makes a somewhat disjointed remark, that all\r\nthe Italian wines of that year were sour and that the season was hot,\r\nwhich would have had as little to do with the one kind of pox as with the\r\nother. Nor is anything said of smallpox spreading among those near the\r\nking[867].\r\n\r\nThe whole sequence of events, from the “folles amours” of Lyons to the\r\nsharp sickness at Asti, has suggested to historians, who have no medical\r\ntheory to advocate, that it was not really _petite vérole_ that the king\r\nsuffered from, but _grosse vérole_. Martin says that Charles VIII.\r\nrecommenced at Asti his Lyons follies and that he became violently sick,\r\n“of the smallpox, says one, or, perhaps, of a new malady which began to\r\nshow itself in Europe,” meaning syphilis. To show that such infection was\r\nalready possible, he quotes an ordinance of the provost of Paris April 15,\r\n1488, enjoining “the leprous” to leave the capital. This is very like\r\nEdward III.’s order to the London “lepers” a century and a half earlier,\r\nin which the reasons given (the frequenting of stews, the pollution of\r\ntheir breath, &c.) point somewhat clearly to the nature of their\r\n“leprosy.” An order for the banishment of “lepers” from Paris in 1488 must\r\nhave been occasioned by some unusual risk of contamination, just as the\r\nLondon order of 1346 would have been. It is in that sense that the French\r\nhistorian regards it; the ordinance, he says, “concernait probablement\r\ndéjà les syphilitiques confondus avec les lépreux[868].”\r\n\r\nDe Comines, who is the authority for the diagnosis of smallpox, had\r\ninserted the word _petite_ before _verolle_ for reasons best known to\r\nhimself. I shall show in the next chapter, upon smallpox and measles in\r\nEngland, that the ambiguous teaching of the faculty as to the nature and\r\naffinities of the pox proper within the first years of its epidemic\r\nappearance gave a ready opportunity of calling the _grosse vérole_ by the\r\nname of _petite vérole_ in circumstances where it was polite, or prudent,\r\nor convenient so to do. The only importance of a correct diagnosis of the\r\nking’s malady is that the case of one would have been the case of many.\r\n\r\nThe indications all point to a somewhat unusual prevalence of _lues\r\nvenerea_ previous to the autumn of 1494, in the luxurious provinces of\r\nsouthern France as well as in the capital. Beyond doubt, the malady had\r\nalready spread by contagion to the great Spanish ports nearest the Gulf of\r\nLyons. The expedition of Charles VIII. passed through that region on its\r\nroute over the Alps. According to Sebastian Brant, it was the French who\r\nbrought the disease into Liguria, and, according to Grünbeck, it issued,\r\n_Gallico tractu, ab occidentali sinu_, gathered like a dense cloud _super\r\nInsubriam_ (the Milanese), and was thence dispersed, as if by the winds,\r\nover the whole province of Liguria.\r\n\r\nBut for the circumstances of the military expedition of 1494, and the\r\nstate of war in Italy for two years after, it is conceivable that the\r\nunusual prevalence in France of a very ancient malady would have had\r\nlittle interest for Europe at large, although the cities on the nearest\r\ncoast of Spain appear to have already shared the infection. That unusual\r\nprevalence in the south of France has in it nothing of mystery; the period\r\nwas the end of the Middle Ages, distinguished by a revival of learning, of\r\ntrade and commerce,--a revival of most things except morals. But, assuming\r\nthat there was such unusual prevalence above the ancient and medieval\r\nlevel, it may still seem unaccountable that a great European epidemic, of\r\na most disastrous and fatal type, should have been engendered therefrom.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many parallel cases, on a minor scale from modern\r\ntimes, of a peculiar severity of type, of inveteracy, and of\r\ncommunicability by unusual ways, having been cultivated from commonplace\r\nbeginnings, among unsophisticated communities about the Baltic and\r\nAdriatic, the people being without resident doctors and unfamiliar with\r\nsuch a disease and its risks. These have been collected and analyzed by\r\nHirsch, whose conclusion is that “the mode of origin, and the character of\r\nthese endemics of syphilis, appear to me to furnish the key to an\r\nunderstanding of the remarkable episode of the disease in the 15th\r\ncentury,--an episode which entirely resembles them as regards its type,\r\nand differs from them only as regards extent[869].”\r\n\r\nReferring the reader for farther particulars to the work quoted, I shall\r\nleave the antecedents of the epidemic of pox in the end of the 15th\r\ncentury to be judged of according to the probabilities thus far stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX AND MEASLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith our modern habit of seeking out the matter of fact, of going back to\r\nthe reality and of reconstructing the theory, it is not easy for us to\r\nunderstand how completely the medieval world of medicine was enslaved to\r\nauthority and tradition even in matters that were directly under their\r\neyes. It was thought a great thing that Linacre, of Oxford, in the first\r\nyears of the 16th century, and Caius, of Cambridge, some fifty years\r\nlater, should have gone back to Galen for their authority, passing over\r\nthe Arabians who had been the interpreters of classical medicine all\r\nthrough the Middle Ages. Their editions of forgotten medical works of the\r\nGraeco-Roman school were a step forward in scholarship, and they opened\r\nthe way to the first-hand observations of disease which really began some\r\nhundred years after with the writings of Willis, Sydenham and Morton. But\r\nsmallpox and measles were not Galenist themes, they were peculiarly\r\nArabian; and the very moderate share that England took in the medical\r\nRevival of Learning made no difference to the paragraphs or chapters on\r\nthose diseases that were circulating in the medieval compends. While the\r\nArabian or Arabistic writers of Spain, of Salerno, and of Montpellier were\r\nthe depositaries and interpreters of the Galenic teaching, they were also\r\nthe first-hand authorities upon some matters of specially Arabian\r\nexperience, of which smallpox and measles were the chief. Whatever was\r\nsaid of those two epidemic maladies abroad, in the systematic works of\r\nGordonio and Gilbert, and in the later compilation of Gaddesden in\r\nEngland, was not only of Arabian origin, but it was all that was known of\r\nthem. Rhazes, the original Arabic writer on smallpox and measles about the\r\nbeginning of the 11th century, supplied both the doctrine and the\r\nexperience. His observations and reasonings, altered or added to by his\r\nlater countrymen, passed bodily into the medical text-books of all Europe.\r\nThe interest in the treatise of Rhazes was so great that it was printed in\r\n1766 by Channing, of Oxford, in Arabic with a Latin translation, and in an\r\nEnglish translation from the original by Greenhill, of Oxford, in 1847.\r\n\r\nIn the literature we took over smallpox from the Arabians; but had we no\r\nnative experiences of the disease itself, and, if so, when did it first\r\nappear in this country? One can hardly attempt an answer to these\r\nquestions even now without stirring up prejudice and embittered memories.\r\nIt has been the fate of smallpox, as an epidemological subject, to be\r\ninvested with bigotry and intolerance. Whoever has maintained that it is\r\nnot as old as creation has been suspected in his motives; anyone who shows\r\nhimself inclined to put limits to its historical duration and its former\r\nextent in Britain is clearly seeking to belittle the advantages that have\r\nbeen derived during the present century from vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe wish to establish the antiquity of the smallpox in Europe has been as\r\nstrong as the wish to overthrow the antiquity of the great pox. While\r\nundoubted traces of the latter in early times have been covered over with\r\nthe generic name of leprosy, the vaguest reference to “pustules” or spots\r\non the skin have been turned by verbalist ingenuity to mean devastating\r\nepidemics of smallpox. I am here concerned only with Britain, and must\r\npass over the much-debated reference by Gregory of Tours to epidemics in\r\nthe 6th century, the period of the Justinian plague. But in England the\r\nepidemic which stands nearest in our annals to the great plague of the 6th\r\ncentury, the widespread infection described by Beda as having begun in 664\r\nand as having continued in monasteries and elsewhere for years after, has\r\nbeen claimed by Willan as an epidemic of smallpox[870]. Willan, with all\r\nhis erudition, was a dermatologist, and acted on the maxim that there is\r\nnothing like leather. His contention in favour of smallpox has been\r\nreferred to in the first chapter, dealing with the plague described by\r\nBeda, and need not farther concern us. It is not in England that we find\r\nevidence of smallpox in those remote times but in Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in the Arabic Annals.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose the evidence on the antiquity of smallpox in China and\r\nIndia may be accepted, and for the rest left out of account. The Arabian\r\ninfluence is nearer to us, and is the only one that practically concerns\r\nus. Coming, then, to the history of smallpox in its prevalence nearest to\r\nEurope, we find a definite statement of the disease appearing first among\r\nthe Abyssinian army of Abraha at the siege of Mecca in what was known as\r\nthe Elephant War of A.D. 569 or 571. The best of the Arabic historians,\r\nTabari[871], writes: “It has been told to us by Ibn Humaid, after Salima,\r\nafter Ibn Ischâg, to whom Ja‘gûb b. Otha b. Mughira b. Achnas related that\r\none had said to him, that in that year the smallpox appeared for the first\r\ntime in Arabia, and also the bitter herbs,--rue, colocynth [and another].”\r\nThe tradition is by word of mouth through several, after the Semitic\r\nmanner, but it need not on that account be set aside as worthless. So far\r\nas concerns the bitter herbs, it is said to be against probability; but as\r\nregards the new form of epidemic sickness, there is no such objection to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic legend, as given by Tabari is as follows: “Thereupon came the\r\nbirds from the sea in flocks, every one with three stones, in the claws\r\ntwo and in the beak one, and threw the stones upon them. Wherever one of\r\nthese stones struck, there arose an evil wound, and pustules all over. At\r\nthat time the smallpox first appeared, and the bitter trees. The stones\r\nundid them wholly. Thereafter God sent a torrent which carried them away\r\nand swept them into the sea. But Abraha and the remnant of his men fled:\r\nhe himself lost one member after another.” In a former passage, the\r\ncalamity of Abraha is thus given: “But Abraha was smitten with a heavy\r\nstroke; as they brought him along in the retreat, his limbs fell off piece\r\nby piece, and as often as a piece fell off, matter and blood came forth.”\r\nTo illustrate this account by Tabari, his recent editor, Nöldeke, cites\r\nthe following from an anti-Mohammedan poem: “Sixty thousand returned not\r\nto their homes, nor did their sick continue in life after their return.”\r\nOne of the elephants which dared to enter the sacred region is said to\r\nhave been also wounded and afflicted by the smallpox.\r\n\r\nIn this narrative of Abraha’s disaster, says Nöldeke, there is a mixture\r\nof natural causation and of purely fabulous miracle; a real and sufficient\r\naccount of the cause of the Abyssinian leader’s discomfiture, namely, an\r\noutbreak of smallpox, had been blended with legendary tales. That the\r\ndisease was smallpox is made probable by the continuity of the Arabic\r\nname; under the same name Rhazes, the earliest systematic writer,\r\ndescribes the symptoms, pathology and treatment of what was unquestionably\r\nthe smallpox afterwards familiar in Western Europe. Why it should have\r\noriginated on Arabian soil in an invading army from Africa, is a question\r\nthat would require much knowledge, now beyond our reach, to answer\r\nconclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory of the nature of Smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the disease should, however, be borne in mind always in the\r\nfront of every speculation as to the origin of its contagious and epidemic\r\nproperties. It involves no speculative considerations to pronounce\r\nsmallpox a skin-disease, of the nature of lichen turned pustular. It is a\r\nskin-disease first, and a contagious or epidemic malady afterwards; its\r\nplace among diseases of the skin is indeed fully acknowledged by\r\ndermatologists. Apart from its contagiousness it conforms to the\r\ncharacters of other cutaneous eruptions: its outbreak is preceded by\r\ndisturbed health, including fever; when the eruption comes out the fever\r\nis so far relieved; and as in some other eruptions which are not\r\ncontagious the constitutional disturbance is in proportion to the area of\r\nthe skin involved. Even the peculiar scars or pits which it leaves behind\r\nin skins of a certain texture or in the more vascular regions, such as the\r\nface, are not unknown in non-contagious skin-diseases; nor does its other\r\npeculiarity, the offensive odour of many pustules, seem unaccountable in a\r\nskin-disease native to tropical countries.\r\n\r\nEruptions on the skin are in many cases the outcome of constitutional\r\nill-health; for example, the eczema of gout. Also where the whole body is\r\ninfected, as in syphilis, there are skin-eruptions, which may be pimples\r\n(lichenous) or scales, or rashes, or, as in the first great outburst of\r\nsyphilis, “pustules” so general over the body that those who were casting\r\nabout for the nosological affinities of the new malady, saw no better\r\nplace for it than Avicenna’s group of _alhumata_, which included smallpox\r\nand measles. That a skin-eruption of the nature of smallpox should have\r\ncome out as a constitutional manifestation, and that a number of persons\r\nshould have exhibited it together for the same internal reason, are both\r\ncredible suppositions, although necessarily unsupported by historic\r\nevidence. Let us suppose that the Abyssinian army before Mecca endured\r\nsome ordinary discomfort of campaigning, that, in the uniformity of their\r\nlife, numbers together had fallen into the same constitutional ill-health\r\njust as numbers together have often fallen into scurvy, and that an\r\neruption of the skin, proper to the tropics, was part of it. What we have\r\nfarther to suppose is that the constitutional eruption became catching\r\nfrom the skin outwards, so to speak,--that it could be detached from its\r\nantecedents in the body, and could exist as an autonomous thing, so that\r\nit would break out upon those who had none of its underlying\r\nconstitutional conditions, but had been merely in contact with such as had\r\ndeveloped it constitutionally or from within. Such detachment of a\r\nconstitutional eruption from its primary conditions is little more than\r\nconstantly happens when a skin-disease like eczema, or acne, persists long\r\nafter its provocation, or the disordered health which called it forth, is\r\nremoved. The inveteracy or chronicity of some skin-diseases is itself a\r\nform of autonomy, but a form of it which does not transcend the\r\nindividual, just as, among infections themselves, cancer does not\r\ntranscend the individual or propagate itself by contagion[872]. But there\r\nexists a closer probable analogy for a secondary eruption becoming a\r\nself-existent or independent infective disease. The instance in view is no\r\nmore than probable, and may easily be disputed by those who have\r\nsufficient prepossessions the other way; but there is no theory that suits\r\nso well the negro disease of yaws as that it is a somewhat peculiar\r\nsecondary of syphilis, which is now able to be communicated as an exanthem\r\ndetached from the primary lesions on which it had depended originally for\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence, historical and geographical, points to the several\r\nvarieties of the black skin (or yellow skin) as the native tissues of\r\nsmallpox. It is not without significance that a disease of the negroes\r\nwhich was observed by English doctors not long ago in the mining districts\r\nof South Africa led to a sharp controversy whether it was smallpox or not:\r\naccording to some, it was a constitutional eruption; according to others\r\nit was a contagious infection. Such phenomena are not likely to be seen in\r\nour latitudes; but the original smallpox itself was not a disease of the\r\ntemperate zone[873].\r\n\r\nI shall not carry farther this line of remark as to the probable\r\ncircumstances in which a pustular eruption, among the Abyssinians before\r\nMecca, or among other Africans or other dark-skinned races in other places\r\nand at other times, had become epidemically contagious in the familiar\r\nway of smallpox. One has to learn by experience that there is at present\r\nno hearing for such inquiries, because a certain dominant fashion in\r\nmedicine prefers to relegate all those origins to the remotest parts of\r\nthe earth and to the earliest ages (practically _ab aeterno_), and there\r\nto leave them with a complacent sense that they have been so disposed of.\r\nThat is not the way in which the study of origins is carried out for all\r\nother matters of human interest. Yet diseases are recent as compared with\r\nthe species of living things; some of them are recent even as compared\r\nwith civilized societies. Epidemical and constitutional maladies touch at\r\nmany points, and depend upon, the circumstances of time and locality, and\r\nupon racial or national characters. Perhaps their origins will one day be\r\nmade a branch of historical or archaeological research.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropean Smallpox in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe present extensive prevalence of smallpox among the Arabs may or may\r\nnot date from the Elephant War of A.D. 569. Its prevalence also in\r\nAbyssinia, so widely in modern times that almost everyone bears the marks\r\nof it, may have no continuous history from the return of Abraha’s\r\nexpedition. But the history of smallpox in the West comes to us through\r\nthe Saracens, and there can be no question that the disease is at the\r\npresent day peculiarly at home in all African countries, and most of all\r\nin the upper basin of the Nile, where, as Pruner says, “it appears as the\r\none great sickness[874].” It is a remark of Freind, whose erudition and\r\njudgment should carry weight, that “the Saracens first brought in this\r\ndistemper, and wherever their arms prevailed, this spread itself with the\r\nsame fury in Africa, in Europe, and through the greatest part of Asia, the\r\neastern part especially[875].” Our inquiry here does not extend beyond\r\nEngland, so that the extremely disputable question of the amount and\r\nfrequency of smallpox in the European countries conquered or invaded by\r\nthe Saracens in the Middle Ages need not be raised[876].\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns England, smallpox was first brought to it, not by the\r\nSaracen arms, but by Saracen pens. The earliest English treatise on\r\nmedicine, the _Rosa Anglica_ of Gaddesden, has the same chapter “De\r\nVariolis [et Morbillis]” as all the other medieval compends--in substance\r\nthe same as in the earlier work of Gilbert, and in all the other Arabistic\r\nwritings earlier or later. The _Rosa Anglica_ was a success in its day,\r\npartly, no doubt, by reason of its style being more boisterous than that\r\nof Gilbert’s or Gordonio’s treatises, partly, also, on account of its\r\nblunt indecency in certain passages. Guy de Chauliac, of Avignon, one of\r\nthe few original observers of the time, had heard of the _Rosa Anglica_,\r\nand was curious to see it; but he found in it “only the fables of\r\nHispanus, of Gilbert, and of Theodoric,” and he rather unkindly fixed upon\r\nit the epithet of “fatuous.” What de Chauliac had probably heard of was\r\nGaddesden’s occasional claims to originality; and these we shall now\r\nexamine so far as they concern smallpox.\r\n\r\nOne of Gaddesden’s variations from the stock remarks on smallpox is his\r\nexplanation of why the disease was called variola: it is called variola,\r\nsays he, because it occurs _in diverse parts of the skin_ (_quia in cute\r\ndiversas partes occupant_). This is an ingenious improvement upon Gilbert,\r\nwho says that it is called variola from the variety of colours (_et\r\ndicitur variola a varietate coloris_)--sometimes red, sometimes white, or\r\nyellow, or green, or violet, or black. Another remark attributed (by Häser\r\nat least) to Gaddesden as original, is that a person may have smallpox\r\ntwice; but Gaddesden, in a later paragraph, shows where he got that from:\r\n“And thus says Avicenna (_quarto_ Canonis), that sometimes a man has\r\nsmallpox twice--once properly, and a second time improperly.” The most\r\nfamous of Gaddesden’s originalities is his treatment by wrapping the\r\npatient in red cloth; for that also Häser ascribes to him. But Peter the\r\nSpaniard, the Hispanus of de Chauliac’s reference given above, is before\r\nhim with the red-cloth treatment also, while he is candid enough to quote\r\nGilbert: “Any cloth dyed in purple,” says Hispanus, “has the property of\r\nattracting the matter to the outside.”\r\n\r\nGilbert’s reference is as follows: “Old women in the country give burnt\r\npurple in the drink, for it has an occult property of curing smallpox. Let\r\na cloth be taken, dyed _de grano_.” Bernard Gordonio, also, says:\r\n“Thereafter let the whole body be wrapped in red cloth.” There was\r\nprobably Arabic authority for that widely diffused prescription, as for\r\nall the rest of the teaching about smallpox. But Gaddesden does improve\r\nupon his predecessors in boldly appealing to his own favourable experience\r\nof red cloth:--“Then let a red cloth be taken, and the variolous patient\r\nbe wrapped in it completely, as I did with the son of the most noble king\r\nof England when he suffered those diseases (_istos morbos_); I made\r\neverything about his bed red, and it is a good cure, and I cured him in\r\nthe end without marks of smallpox.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to this cure, it has to be said, in the first place, that\r\nthe object of the red cloth was to draw the matter to the surface[877],\r\nand that it had nothing to do with the prevention of pitting. The means\r\nto prevent pitting was usually to open the pustules with a golden needle;\r\nthat is the Arabian advice, and all the Arabists copy it. Gaddesden among\r\nthe rest copies it, but he does not say that he practised it on the king’s\r\nson. If he had said so, we might have believed that the disease was\r\nactually one bearing pustules which could be opened by a needle. What he\r\nsays, in the earliest printed text (Pavia, 1492) is that, while the king’s\r\nson was “suffering from those diseases,” he caused him to be wrapped in\r\nred cloth, and the bed to be hung with the same, and that he cured him\r\nwithout the marks of smallpox. Gaddesden was not altogether an honest\r\npractitioner; on the contrary he was an early specimen of the quack _in\r\nexcelsis_. According to the learned and judicious Dr Freind, “his\r\npractice, I doubt, was not formed upon any extraordinary knowledge of his\r\nfaculty;” and again, “He was, as it appears from his own writings,\r\nsagacious enough to see through the foibles of human nature; he could form\r\na good judgment how far mankind could be imposed upon; and never failed to\r\nmake his advantage of their credulity[878].” The opportunity of diagnosing\r\nvariola in the king’s son, and of curing it by red cloth, so as to leave\r\nno pits, was one that such a person was not likely to let slip. “It is a\r\ngood cure,” he says; and we may go so far with him as to admit that it\r\nmust have been impressive to the royal household to have heard some sharp\r\nsickness of the nursery called by the formidable name of variola, and to\r\nhave seen it cured “_sine vestigiis_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles in Medieval Writings.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of the Arabians and of their imitators, the so-called\r\nArabists, measles and smallpox are always taken together. The usual\r\ndistinction made between them is that _morbilli_, or measles, come from\r\nthe bile, whereas _variolae_, or smallpox, come from the blood, that the\r\nformer are small, and that they are less apt to attack the eyes. The\r\nreference in Gaddesden is of the usual kind, but it is complicated by the\r\nintroduction of a third term, _punctilli_, which Gruner, however, takes to\r\nbe merely a synonym for _morbilli_. As Gaddesden’s passage is of some\r\nimportance for the history of the familiar name of the disease in England,\r\nI shall translate it at length, so far as it can be made into sense:--\r\n\r\n    “Variolae are so called, as if variously choosing the skin itself,\r\n    because in the skin they occupy divers parts, by apostematising and\r\n    infecting; they are caused by corruption of blood, and therein they\r\n    differ from morbilli and punctilli.\r\n\r\n    Morbilli are small apostemata in the skin generated of bile; and they\r\n    are a diminutive of apostematous diseases because they occupy less\r\n    space by reason of the sharpness of choleric matter. They are in fact\r\n    variolae of choleric matter, and the smallest of pustules. But\r\n    punctilli are infections commonly sanguineous, as if they had arisen\r\n    from a fleabite, only they remain continually. And punctilli are of\r\n    two kinds, large and small. Of the small I have already spoken [under\r\n    the name of morbilli?]. But the large are broad, red and opaque\r\n    infections in the legs of poor and wasting persons, (_pauperum et\r\n    consumptuorum_), who sit as if continually at the fire without boots;\r\n    and they are called in English _mesles_[879].”\r\n\r\nThe rest of Gaddesden’s chapter on smallpox and measles contains nothing\r\nthat is not to be found in Avicenna or in any medieval compend on\r\nmedicine. But the passage quoted is of interest as using the old word\r\n“mesles” to mean one of the two forms of _morbilli_ or _punctilli_. We are\r\nhere enabled to see a little way into the confusion of mind which attended\r\nthe medievalists in their verbalist dealing with disease. The syntax of\r\nGaddesden’s sentence implies that the broad, red and opaque infections on\r\nthe legs of poor and wasted persons were called in English _mesles_. In\r\nother writers, both before and after his date, the name of mesles or\r\nmesels or meseals was given, not to a form of disease, but to a class of\r\nsufferers from disease. It is the name applied to the inmates of\r\nleper-houses by Matthew Paris (circa 1250)--_miselli_ and _misellae_,\r\nbeing diminutives of _miser_[880]. It is the word used for the same class\r\nin the Norman-French entries in the Rolls of Parliament in the reign of\r\nEdward I. fixing the taxation of leper-houses: if the head of the house\r\nwas himself a _meseal_, the hospital was to pay nothing, but if the head\r\nwere a whole man, the hospital had to pay[881]. The same use of mesles, as\r\nmeaning the leprous, in the generic sense, occurs several times in the\r\n14th century poem, ‘The Vision of Piers the Ploughman[882].’ Thus, Christ\r\nin His ministrations,\r\n\r\n            “Sought out the sick and sinful both,\r\n  And salved sick and sinful, both blind and crooked;\r\n  And comune women converted, and to good turned.\r\n  Both meseles and mute, and in the menysoun bloody,\r\n  Oft he heled such. He ne held it for no mystery,\r\n  Save tho he leched Lazar that had ylain into grave.”\r\n\r\nOr again:\r\n\r\n  “Ac old men and hore that helpless ben of strength,\r\n   And women with child that worche ne mowe,\r\n   Blind and bedred and broken their members,\r\n   That taketh their mischief mekely, as meseles and other.”\r\n\r\nIt is this old English word “mesles,” meaning the leprous in the generic\r\nsense, that Gaddesden brings into his Latin text in connexion with\r\n_morbilli_ (or _punctilli_). It is useless to look for precision in such a\r\nwriter; but if his introduction of “mesles” in the particular context mean\r\nanything at all, it means that the English word represented a variety of\r\n_morbilli_,--the large, broad and opaque variety. That it should have\r\noccurred to him to bring these blotches or spots on the legs of poor\r\npeople even remotely into relation with the _morbilli_ of the Arabians,\r\nprobably means that Gaddesden had a merely verbal acquaintance with the\r\nlatter, or that he knew them only in books. It is certainly improbable\r\nthat anyone, even in the Middle Ages, who had ever seen a case of measles\r\nshould bracket that transitory and insubstantial mottling of the skin,\r\nwith the large, broad and “obscure” spots (or nodules, or what else) on\r\nthe legs of poor and wasted persons, which were called, in the vernacular,\r\nmesles. But Gaddesden, though a verbalist and a plagiary, was a great name\r\nin medicine, a name usually joined (as in Chaucer) with more solid\r\nreputations than his own. If he identified “mesles” with a variety of\r\n_morbilli_ (which variety no one but himself seems to have heard of), it\r\nwas an easy transition for the name in English usage to become what it now\r\nis, measles meaning _morbilli_, in the correct and only real sense of the\r\nlatter[883].\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of the name “Pocks” in English.\r\n\r\nGaddesden’s case of _variola_ which he cured without pitting by means of\r\nred cloth stands alone in English records until the 16th century; probably\r\nhe was as little able to diagnose variola as _morbilli_, and it is more\r\nthan probable that he would not have scrupled to call some infantile\r\nmalady by the book-name _variola_, on the principle of “omne ignotum pro\r\nterribili,” when there was anything to be gained by so doing. There is no\r\nindependent evidence that smallpox or measles existed in England in the\r\n14th and 15th centuries. There are extant various medieval\r\nprescription-books, in which remedies are given for all the usual\r\ndiseases. If the name of _variola_, or any English form of it, occur\r\ntherein, we should draw the same inference as from the prescriptions for\r\nmaladies of children such as “the kernels,” and “the kink” (or\r\nwhooping-cough)[884]. In the Anglo-Saxon “leechdoms,” which have been\r\ncollected in three volumes, the word _poc_ occurs once in the singular in\r\nthe phrase “a poc of the eye” (probably a hordeum or sty of the eyelid),\r\nand once in the plural (_poccan_) without reference to any part of the\r\nbody and with no indication that a general eruption was meant. Willan,\r\nindeed, has found in a manuscript of uncertain date a Latin incantation\r\nagainst disease, in which the words _lues_, _pestis_, _pestilentia_, and\r\n_variola_ occur; at the end of it is written in Anglo-Saxon an invocation\r\nof certain saints to “shield me from the _lathan poccas_ and from all\r\nevil[885].” This looks as if _poccas_ had been the Anglo-Saxon translation\r\nof _variola_. But it remains to be seen in what sense the word “pokkes”\r\nwas used in the earliest English writings.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Vision of Piers the Ploughman’ (passus XX) the retribution of\r\nNature or “Kynde” upon the wickedness of the times is thus mentioned:\r\n\r\n  “Kynde came after with many keen sores,\r\n   As pokkes and pestilences, and much people shent;\r\n   So kynde through corruptions killed full many.”\r\n\r\nIn the lines immediately preceding there occur some other names, equally\r\ngeneric:\r\n\r\n  “Byles and boches and brennyng agues\r\n   Frensyes and foul evils, foragers of kynde.”\r\n\r\n“Boche” is botch,--the name given to the plague as late as the Stuart\r\nperiod, from its chief external sign, the bubo; and “byles” is merely the\r\nLatin _bilis_ = _ulcus_. “Pokkes” may be the Anglo-Saxon word; but it is\r\nknown that many of Langland’s colloquialisms are of Norman or French\r\norigin, and in that language there is a term _poche_, which is not far\r\nfrom the English “boche.” Whether “poche” be the same as “boche” or not,\r\n“pokkes and pestilences” may be taken to be synonyms for “byles and\r\nboches.” The generic or elastic use of such terms received a striking\r\nillustration in 1528, when spotted fever (typhus), perhaps mixed with\r\nplague, became exceedingly common among French and Spanish troops. Among\r\nthe French the disease was called _les poches_ and among the Spaniards\r\n_las bubas_[886], although both names had been assigned to syphilis at the\r\ntime of its epidemic outburst in the end of the 15th century. In those\r\ntimes diseases were called by their external marks; so that diseases\r\nessentially most unlike, but having certain spots, or blemishes, or\r\nbotches, or pustules of the skin in common, were called by a common name.\r\nThe plague itself was known by certain spots on the breast or back called\r\ntokens: hence the figure of John Stow and others that “many died of God’s\r\ntokens.”\r\n\r\nThere was certainly laxity of naming to that extent in the case of modern\r\nlanguages. As to Willan’s inference from the medieval incantation, it is\r\nby no means clear that _variola_ in medieval Latin may not have been used\r\ngenerically also; although, in the school of Salerno it appears to have\r\nhad its meaning fixed, in the Arabic sense of smallpox, from the time of\r\nConstantinus Africanus, who introduced the teaching of Bagdad into that\r\nschool about the year 1060.\r\n\r\nThe next use of “pokkes” that I have found is in a manuscript chronicle of\r\nEngland down to the year 1419[887], one of the series known as the\r\nchronicle of the Brute (from its commencing with the mythical landing of\r\nBrutus in England after the siege of Troy); this manuscript, known as the\r\n“Fruit of Times,” was afterwards printed at the St Albans press about\r\n1484[888], the history being carried down to Edward IV., and the passage\r\nin question reproduced exactly as it stands in the handwriting. Under the\r\n40th year of Edward III. (1366) there is the following entry:\r\n\r\n    “Ther fell also such a pestalence that never none such was seen in no\r\n    man’s tyme or lyf, for many men as they were gone to bede hole and in\r\n    gude poynte sodanly thei diede. Also that tyme fell a seknes that men\r\n    call ye pokkes, slogh both men and women thorgh ther enfectyne.”\r\n\r\nIt is clearly the same passage that occurs condensed in the chronicle of\r\nWilliam Gregory, mayor of London, which was written probably in\r\n1451-52[889]. Under the 40th of Edward III., after referring to a “grete\r\nbatille of sparows” just as the earlier chronicle does, he proceeds: “Also\r\nthe same yere men and bestys were grettely infectyd with pockys, wherfore\r\nthey dyde, bothe men and bestys.” The variation of “men and beasts,”\r\ninstead of men and women, is curious, and suggests that there may have\r\nbeen a common source for the story. The chronicle contemporary with 1366,\r\nwhich is of best authority, was that kept at St Albans Abbey; but it gives\r\nnothing under that year. Shortly after 1361, however, and probably about\r\n1362 or 1363 it has a singular entry, which may have been the source of\r\nthese references to “pockys.” The Latin may be translated thus: “Numbers\r\ndied of the disease of lethargy prophesying troubles to many; many women\r\nalso died of the flux; and there was a general murrain of cattle[890].”\r\nHere we have men, women, and cattle; also lethargy, flux, and murrain; and\r\nit is conceivable that later compilers of English chronicles may each have\r\nused this contemporary Latin entry of composite events to put their own\r\ngloss upon it, or to amplify the history into what each conceived to be\r\nthe probable meaning. But the most singular enlargement was that made by\r\nHolinshed in his chronicle of 1577. Having copied word for word, sparrows\r\nand all, the entry under the year 1366 in the “Fruit of Times” (as printed\r\nat St Albans about 1484), he takes leave to amend the sense in the part\r\nthat chiefly concerns us--he changes “pockys” into “smallpocks,” and “men\r\nand women” into “men, women, and children[891].” Holinshed was dealing\r\nwith an event two hundred years before his own time, and had no more\r\nfirst-hand knowledge of it than we have; but his authority has been\r\naccepted for the fatal prevalence of smallpox in 1366 by modern writers on\r\nthe history of that disease, such as James Moore[892], who have not sought\r\nfor the contemporary authority nor exercised a critical judgment upon the\r\nlax ways of verbalist compilers. Thus is history made--but not so easily\r\nunmade.\r\n\r\nOne other reference to “pockys” has to be noticed before we leave the\r\nphilological part of the subject and come to the unambiguous history of\r\nthe realities. Fabyan, in his _Chronicle_ written not long before his\r\ndeath in 1512, says that Edward IV. during an expedition to the Scots\r\nMarches “was then vysyted with the syknesse of pockys[893].” It is futile\r\nto conjecture what the king’s illness may really have been. The word in\r\nFabyan’s time had already acquired a technical sense, which it has ever\r\nsince retained; but that well-understood meaning was some twenty years\r\nlater than the year 1474 (although the disease itself doubtless existed\r\nall through the Middle Ages); while, in its earlier generic sense, as in\r\nthe ‘Vision of Piers the Ploughman,’ it seems to have meant botches or\r\nother tokens of pestilential disease. In a Latin glossary of English\r\nwords, published a hundred years after[894], “a pocke” is still defined as\r\n_phagedaena_, and “the French pocke” as _morbus Gallicus_, while\r\n“smallpox” is not given at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in England in the 16th Century.\r\n\r\nThe earliest references to smallpox in England, apart from the probably\r\nincorrect one by Gaddesden early in the 14th century, occur in letters of\r\nthe years 1514 and 1518. Another letter of 1514 will serve to bring out\r\nthe ambiguity of the names given to diseases at the time. On June 30,\r\n1514, Gerard de Pleine writes from London to Margaret of Savoy that he had\r\nbeen asked by the bishop of Lincoln why the marriage between the princess\r\nMary and Louis XII. had been broken off (it took place shortly after), and\r\nby another great peer whether Louis XII. “avoit eu les pocques,” which\r\nlast sentence has a marginal note in the printed collection of letters:\r\n“c’est la petite verole[895].” But _les pocques_ in a letter written from\r\nLondon in 1514 did not mean the smallpox. In a letter of March 3, 1514,\r\nPeter Martyr writing in Latin from Valladolid to Ludovico Mendoza, says\r\nthat the King of England has had a fever, and that the physicians were\r\nafraid it would turn to the pustules called _variolae_, but he is now well\r\nagain and rises from his bed[896]. This illness of Henry VIII. happened at\r\nRichmond previous to 7th February. Although in the letter quoted there was\r\nonly a fear that the illness might have turned to the pustules called\r\nsmallpox, yet in the instructions of Henry VIII. to Spinelly, English\r\nambassador in the Low Countries, sent in February, the twelfth item\r\ninstructs him to say that the English king has lately been visited by a\r\nmalady “nommée la petitte verolle[897].”\r\n\r\nFour years after, on July 14, 1518, Pace writes to Wolsey from\r\nWallingford, where the court then was, that the king was to leave next day\r\nfor Bisham “as it is time; for they do die in these parts in every place,\r\nnot only of the small pokkes and mezils, but also of the great\r\nsickness[898].”\r\n\r\nThese are the earliest known instances of the use of the words _pocques_,\r\n_variola_, _petite verolle_, “small pokkes and mezils,” as applied to\r\nparticular cases of sickness, in correspondence from or relating to\r\nEngland. The remarks to be made upon the early usage are: first, that the\r\nword _pocques_, as used by one writing in French from London in 1514, did\r\nnot mean smallpox, but pox; second, that the first authentic mention of\r\nsmallpox happens to have been in the French form--“une maladie nommée la\r\npetitte verolle;” third, that, in the political gossip of the time the\r\nopinion of the physicians regarding the illness of the young king is given\r\nas of a fever which they feared might have turned to the pustules called\r\n“_variolae_;” and fourthly, that in the very first mention of the disease\r\n_variola_ by an English name “small pokkes,” the name is modelled on the\r\nFrench, being coupled with the old English name “mezils.” It is impossible\r\nto infer from these references anything as to the amount of smallpox in\r\nEngland at the time, or even to be sure of the correctness of the\r\ndiagnosis. The lax usage as between “pox” and “smallpox” is shown in a\r\nbook of the year 1530 called ‘Prognosticacions out of Ipocras and Avicen,’\r\nin which a brief reference to _variola_ in the Latin original is\r\ntranslated “to prognosticate of the pockes.”\r\n\r\nIn Sir Thomas Elyot’s _Castel of Health_, published in 1541, children\r\nafter their first infancy are said to suffer from a number of maladies,\r\nand in “England commonly purpyls, meazels and smallpockes.” That is\r\nperhaps the first use of the terms in a systematic work on medicine, not\r\nindeed by one of the faculty, but by a layman. About the same time we hear\r\nof smallpocks in an infant of noble family: a letter of May 26, 1537, from\r\nCharles duke of Suffolk to Cromwell, written from Hoxun in Suffolk,\r\nexcuses his not repairing to Lincolnshire, as the king had ordered, on the\r\nground that “his son fell sick of the smallpox and his wife of the\r\nague[899].” “His son” was Henry Brandon, born September 18, 1535, so that\r\nhe was then an infant of some twenty months; he is the same that died,\r\nwith his younger brother, of the sweating sickness in July 1551.\r\n\r\nThe reference to smallpocks and meazels by Elyot in his _Castel of\r\nHealth_ is repeated in the almost contemporary _Book of Children_ by\r\nThomas Phaer. Whether Phaer translated that also “out of the French\r\ntongue” as he did the _Regiment of Life_, with which it is bound up in the\r\nedition of 1553, we have nowhere any information. In a list of forty\r\ninfirmities of children, the 32nd in order is “small pockes and measels.”\r\nA later passage in the _Book of Children_ shows how much, or how little,\r\nintelligent meaning Phaer attached to these terms: “Of smallpockes and\r\nmeasels. This disease is common and familiar, called of the Greeks by the\r\ngeneral name of exanthemata, and of Plinie papulae et pituitae eruptiones.\r\nIt is of two kinds:--varioli, ye measils; morbilli, called of us ye smal\r\npocks. They be but of one nature and proceed of one cause. The signs of\r\nboth are so manifest to sight that they need no farther declaration;”--but\r\nhe does add some signs, such as “itch and fretting of the skin as if it\r\nhad been rubbed with nettles, pain in the head and back etc.: sometimes as\r\nit were a dry scab or lepry spreading over all the members, other whiles\r\nin pushes, pimples and whayls running with much corruption and matter, and\r\nwith great pains of the face and throat, dryness of the tongue, hoarseness\r\nof voice, and, in some, quiverings of the heart with sownings.” He then\r\ngives the four causes, three of them being intrinsic states of the\r\nhumours, and the fourth “when the disease commenceth by the way of\r\ncontagion, when a sick person infecteth another, and in that case it hath\r\ngreat affinity with the pestilence.” The treatment is directed towards\r\nbringing out the eruption; all occasions of chill are to be carefully\r\navoided. More special directions are given for cases in which “the wheales\r\nbe outrageous and great;” also, “to take away the spots and scarres of the\r\nsmall pockes and measils,” a prescription of some authors is given, to use\r\nthe blood of a bull or of a hare.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Phaer’s section on smallpox and measles bears evidence of a\r\nforeign source, namely the same stock chapter from which Kellwaye drew\r\nmost of his section upon the same two diseases appended to his book on the\r\nplague in 1593. Not only does Phaer speak of smallpox and measles\r\nconjointly as leaving spots and scars, but he actually renders _variolae_\r\nby measles, and _morbilli_ by smallpox. Phaer was more of a literary\r\ncompiler than a physician with original knowlege of diseases and their\r\npathology. But he is not singular among the Tudor writers in taking\r\nmeasles to be the equivalent of _variolae_. William Clowes, of St\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, one of the most experienced practitioners of his\r\ntime, does the same. His _Proved Practice for all Young Chirurgeons_ has\r\nan appendix of Latin aphorisms “taken out of an old written coppy,” to\r\neach of which aphorisms Clowes has added an English translation: in the\r\naphorism on _variolae_, that term is translated “measles,” the name of\r\n“smallpox” nowhere occurring in the book. Clowes’s translation is exactly\r\nin accordance with the English-Latin glossary of the time by Levins\r\n(1570). Levins was an Oxford fellow who had graduated in medicine and\r\nafterwards become a schoolmaster, just as Cogan, of _The Haven of Health_,\r\nhad done. He wrote the _Pathway of Health_, and also compiled the\r\n_Manipulus Vocabulorum_. His definitions in the latter may be taken,\r\ntherefore, to stand for the medical usage of the time. In this glossary,\r\n“ye maysilles” is rendered by _variole_, while the name of “smallpox” is\r\nomitted altogether, “a pocke” having its Latin equivalent in _phagedaena_,\r\nand “ye French pocke” in _morbus Gallicus_. In the Elizabethan dictionary\r\nby Baret, “the maisils” is defined as “a disease with many reddish spottes\r\nor speckles in the face and bodie, much like freckles in colour;” and that\r\nwas the disease which the English profession then understood to be the\r\nsame as the _variolae_ of medieval writers.\r\n\r\nI leave readers to draw their own conclusions, whether there was much or\r\nlittle smallpox or measles in England in the Tudor period. They may be\r\nreminded that Pace, dean of St Paul’s, in a letter from Berkshire in 1518,\r\nasserts the fatal prevalence of “smallpox and mezils,” and that the duke\r\nof Suffolk called the illness of his infant son by the name of smallpox in\r\n1538. They may be farther helped to a conclusion by the following curious\r\ninstance which has been recorded by John Stow.\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous collections of that antiquary preserved in the\r\nLambeth Library[900], there is a narrative of the troubled conscience of\r\nMaster Richard Allington, esquire, a gentleman who appears to have lent\r\nmoney at high interest. Believing himself to be dying on November 22,\r\n1561, he summoned to his bedside at eight in the evening the Master of the\r\nRolls (“Sir John of the Rolls”), two doctors of the law and two other\r\nlawyers.\r\n\r\n    He began: “Maisters, seinge that I muste nedes die, which I assure you\r\n    I nevar thought wolde have cum to passe by this dessease, consyderinge\r\n    it is but the small pockes, I woulde therefore moste hertely desyre\r\n    you in the reuerence of God and for Christes passions sake to suffer\r\n    me to speake untyll I be dede, that I may dyscharge my conscens” etc.\r\n    He then explains that “no man had so especial tokens of God’s singular\r\n    grace, and so litele regarded them as I have done,” and goes on to\r\n    mention particular acts of usury and to offer restitution to the\r\n    amount of some hundred pounds or more. It had occurred to him to do so\r\n    the second night after he fell sick, being in perfect memory lying in\r\n    his bed broad awake, but with puppets dancing around him. After\r\n    entrusting the lawyers at his bed side with these restitutions, he\r\n    asked the Master of the Rolls to read to him certain of the\r\n    penitential Psalms which the sick man had selected as appropriate.\r\n    “And then he thought he should have died, but then broth being given\r\n    unto him, he revived again and fell to prayer and gave himself wholly\r\n    to quietness;” and there the narrative ends.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a reference in Stow’s _Survey of London_ that he did die\r\nin 1561, and that his widow was left well off: for she afterwards built\r\none of the finest of the new houses that were now beginning to line the\r\nhighway of Holborn almost as far out as St Giles’s in the Fields.\r\n\r\nThis is the first recorded case of smallpox in English. According to the\r\npatient’s own view, smallpox was not usually a formidable disease, nor\r\ndoes it appear that the Master of the Rolls and four other eminent lawyers\r\n(Dr Caldwell, Dr Good, Mr Garth, and Mr Jones) had been apprehensive of\r\ncatching it. One finds no other evidence of the existence of smallpox in\r\nLondon or elsewhere in England until it is mentioned in a letter of 1591\r\nand in the essay of Kellwaye, 1593, which asserts the occurrence of\r\n“smallpox and measles” in almost the same language as Phaer’s earlier\r\n_Book of Children_ and for the most part under the same foreign\r\ninspiration. From Scotland we have a single reference in Dr Gilbert\r\nSkene’s essay on the plague, published in 1568, from the terms of which\r\none may suppose that he is giving his own experience. The season, he\r\nsays, will sometimes foretell the plague, as well as other diseases:\r\n\r\n    “Siclyk quhen pokis or sic pustulis are frequent, not onlie amangis\r\n    barnis, but also amangis those quha be of constant or declynand\r\n    aige--greit frequent south and south-vest vyndis.” In a similar\r\n    passage on the previous page he couples “pokis, mesillis and siclike\r\n    diseisis of bodie[901].”\r\n\r\nIn a letter of August 26, 1591, written to a member of queen Elizabeth’s\r\ncourt, it is said: “Hir Higness wold you should remove from that place\r\nwhere the smalle pocks were, to take the fresh and clere ayre, the better\r\nto purge ye from the infection[902].”\r\n\r\nIn 1593 we come to the first systematic English essay on the disease,\r\nappended to the treatise on the plague by Simon Kellwaye[903]. The author\r\nis otherwise unknown as a medical writer, but he is commended in a preface\r\nby George Baker, a court surgeon, for his “good and zealous intent and\r\nsufficiencie in his profession.” In appending an essay on smallpox to a\r\ntreatise on the plague he follows the example of the Salernian treatise of\r\nAlphanus, which also affords him most of his systematic materials in both\r\ndiseases, filtered through Ambroise Paré and other writers. Kellwaye\r\nclaims, however, to have incorporated native experience: “which work I\r\nhave collected and drawn from sundry both auncient and later writers, the\r\nwhich being shadowed under the calm shroud of auncient consent and\r\nstrengthened with the abundant sap of late experience (as well mine own as\r\nothers) I here present the same.” In the treatise on the plague (fol. 2)\r\nhe mentions smallpox as among the forerunners or prognostics of that\r\ndisease:\r\n\r\n    “When the smalle poxe doth generally abound both in young and old\r\n    people.” In the separate essay on the smallpox (fol. 38), its interest\r\n    is again that of a forerunner or sequel of the plague, according to\r\n    the foreign teaching of the time:\r\n\r\n    “For that oftentimes those that are infected with the plague are in\r\n    the end of the disease sometimes troubled with the smallpockes or\r\n    measels, as also by good observation it hath been seen that they are\r\n    forerunners or warnings of the plague to come, as Salius and divers\r\n    other writers do testify, I have thought good and as a matter\r\n    pertinent to my former treatise” etc.\r\n\r\n    He proceeds: “I need not greatly to stand upon the description of this\r\n    disease because it is a thing well known unto most people.” It begins\r\n    with a fever; then shortly after there arise small red pustules upon\r\n    the skin throughout all the body, which come forth more or less\r\n    intermittently; “In some there arise many little pustules with\r\n    elevation of the skin, which in one day do increase and grow bigger,\r\n    and after have a thick matter growing in them, which the Greeks call\r\n    exanthemata or ecthymata; and after the Latins variola, in our English\r\n    tongue the smallpockes; and here some writers do make a difference\r\n    betwixt variola and exanthemata: for, say they, that is called variola\r\n    when many of those pustules do suddenly run into a clear bladder, as\r\n    if it had been scalled, but the other doth not so; yet are they both\r\n    one in the cure.” He recognizes the contagious property of the\r\n    disease, calling it “hereditable:” “For we see when one is infected\r\n    therewith, that so many as come near him (especially those which are\r\n    allied in the same blood) do assuredly for the most part receive the\r\n    infection also.” His _Practica_ are taken almost entirely from the\r\n    Arabian writers, as filtered through Gaddesden, one of them being the\r\n    prevention of pitting by opening the pocks with a gold pin or needle.\r\n    He had heard, however, “of some which, having not used anything at\r\n    all, but suffering them to dry up and fall of themselves without\r\n    picking or scratching, have done very well, and not any pits remained\r\n    after it.” He then refers to complications, such as ulcerations of the\r\n    skin, soreness and ulcerations of the mouth (_aphthae_), soreness of\r\n    the tonsils, and glueing together of the eyelids, all of which are\r\n    stock paragraphs in the foreign writers of the time and are probably\r\n    transferred from the latter. Also he goes a considerable way towards\r\n    the separation of measles from smallpox, which was not fully effected\r\n    in England until the century following: “What the measels or males\r\n    are:--many little pimples which are not to be seen but only by feeling\r\n    with the hand are to be perceived; they do not maturate as the pocks\r\n    doth do, nor assault the eyes” etc.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years after Kellwaye’s essay, there began, in 1604, the\r\nclassification of the deaths in London by the Company of Parish Clerks:\r\nbut it was not until 1629 that their weekly and annual bills were\r\nregularly printed. In the first printed bills, “Flox, smallpox and\r\nmeasles” appear as one entry. The meaning of “flox” seems to be explained\r\nby Kellwaye’s remark: “And here some writers do make a difference betwixt\r\nvariola and exanthemata; for, say they, that is called variola when many\r\nof those pustules do suddenly run into a clear bladder as if it had been\r\nscalled, but the other doth not so.” That is the distinction between\r\nconfluent smallpox and discrete; and the most probable explanation of\r\n“flox” is that it stands for the confluent kind, or for the pustules that\r\nrun together into a clear bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in the 17th Century.\r\n\r\nThe gradual rise of smallpox to prominence in England about the end of the\r\nElizabethan period and in the first years of the Stuarts cannot fail to\r\nstrike anyone who is occupied with the English records of disease as a\r\nwhole. Smallpox and measles may have been, and almost certainly were,\r\nobserved in England in the earlier part of the 16th century; but they make\r\nno such figure in the records, domestic and other, as they do from the\r\nbeginning of the 17th century onwards. Perhaps the first mention of\r\nsmallpox, in English literature proper, occurs in a collection of lyrical\r\npoems published in 1602[904]. In some verses “Upon his Ladies sicknesse of\r\nthe Small Pocks,” the poet, Th. Spilman, apostrophises the “cruel and\r\nimpartial sickness” and asks,--\r\n\r\n  Are not these thy steps I trace\r\n  In the pure snow of her face?\r\n\r\n  Th’ heavenly honey thou dost suck\r\n  From her rose cheeks, might suffice;\r\n  Why then didst thou mar and pluck\r\n  Those dear flowers of rarest price?\r\n\r\nIn two letters of Dr Donne, dean of St Paul’s, written probably a few\r\nyears before his death in 1631, reference is made to the smallpox in\r\nLondon. In the one he says:\r\n\r\n    “At my return from Kent to my gate, I found Peg had the pox: so I\r\n    withdrew to Prickham and spent a fortnight there. And without coming\r\n    home, when I could with some justice hope that it would spread no\r\n    farther amongst them (as I humbly thank God it hath not, nor much\r\n    disfigured her that had it), I went into Bedfordshire” etc.\r\n\r\nThis dread of smallpox infection is quite unlike anything that we meet\r\nwith in the earlier 16th-century domestic memorials; in them it is only\r\nthe infection of the plague that comes in. Donne’s other reference is to\r\nthe sickness of my lord Harrington: “a few days since they were doubtful\r\nof him; but he is so well recovered that now they know all his disease to\r\nbe the pox and measles mingled[905].”\r\n\r\nCases of smallpox among the upper classes are occasionally mentioned in\r\nthe letters written by Chamberlain to Carleton in the reigns of James I.\r\nand Charles I.[906]. On December 17, 1612, “The Lord Lisle hath lost his\r\neldest son, Sir William Sidney, by the smallpox, which were well come\r\nout.” On December 31, the same year, Carleton, writing from abroad,\r\nmentions that the duke of Mantua had died of the smallpox about three\r\nweeks since, of which he buried his only son not three weeks before. Also\r\non December 31, Chamberlain writes to him, that the Lady Webbe was sick of\r\nthe smallpox, of which, he says in another letter, she died: “She was\r\ngrown a very proper woman, but loved the town too well, which in a short\r\ntime would have drawn her and her husband dry as well in purse as in\r\nreputation.” It is the year 1614 that is given (by Horst) as the worst\r\nseason of smallpox all over Europe and the East; England is mentioned by\r\nthe foreign writer as among the countries affected, but there is no trace\r\nof an epidemic in our own records. On April 20, 1616, Chamberlain mentions\r\nthe case of the duke of Buckingham, the favourite; “he hath been crazy of\r\nlate, not without suspicion of the smallpox, which, if it had fallen out,\r\n_actum est de amicitia_. But it proves otherwise.” Buckingham’s illness,\r\nfor which he took much physic, produced an imposthume on his head (an\r\neffect which followed in the more notorious illness of Wolsey), and he is\r\nelsewhere said to be suffering from the _morbus comitialis_. The\r\nsuggestion of smallpox appears to be the same euphemism which was resorted\r\nto in the cases of other exalted personages.\r\n\r\nOn August 21, 1624, having written of the great mortality from fevers,\r\nChamberlain adds: “Lady Winwood, hearing that her only daughter was fallen\r\nsick of the smallpox at Ditton and that they came not out currently,” had\r\ngone to her. On December 18, 1624, “the Lady Purbeck is sick of the\r\nsmallpox, and her husband is so kind that he stirs not from her bed’s\r\nfeet.” In the first week of June, 1625, the famous composer Orlando\r\nGibbons died at Canterbury, not without suspicion of the plague[907], but\r\naccording to another opinion of the smallpox[908].\r\n\r\nWith the year 1629, the causes of death in London began to be published by\r\nParish Clerks’ Hall in a rough classification, smallpox being a regular\r\nitem from year to year. For the first eight years the deaths from “flox,\r\nsmallpox, and measles” were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1629        72\r\n  1630        40\r\n  1631        58\r\n  1632       531\r\n  1633        72\r\n  1634      1354\r\n  1635       293\r\n  1636       127\r\n\r\nThe greatest epidemic, it will be seen, was in 1634[909]. For the years\r\n1637-1646, the figures are lost (owing to Graunt’s omitting them in his\r\nTable of 1662, for want of room). But it is known from letters that the\r\nautumn of 1641 was a season of severe smallpox as well as plague. Thus on\r\nAugust 26, “both Houses grow very thin by reason of the smallpox and\r\nplague that is in the town, 133 dying here this week of the plague, and\r\n118 of the smallpox, 610 in the whole of all diseases.” On September 9, a\r\nletter from Charing Cross says: “Died this week of the plague 185, and of\r\nthe smallpox 101.” The plague mortality continues to be mentioned in\r\nsubsequent letters, but the references to smallpox cease[910]. On July 16,\r\n1642, one excuses his attendance on some State business because he is sick\r\nof the smallpox[911].\r\n\r\nAbout the Restoration the references to smallpox become more\r\nnumerous[912]. A letter of January 4, 1658 (1659), speaks of “much\r\nsickness in the town [London], especially fevers, agues and smallpox.” On\r\nFebruary 7, 1660, the earl of Anglesey is dead of the smallpox. In\r\nSeptember, 1660, Lord Oxford had a severe attack and recovered; at the\r\nsame time the duke of Gloucester, on the 8th September, was diagnosed by\r\nthe doctors to have “a disease between the smallpox and the measles; he is\r\nnow past danger of death for this bout, as the doctors say.” However he\r\ndied on 14th September, in the tenth day of the disease, with remarkable\r\nevidences (post mortem) of internal haemorrhage, having bled freely at the\r\nnose a few hours before his death. The eruption had “come out full and\r\nkindly” at the beginning, so that it was not the ordinary haemorrhagic\r\ntype. On the 20th December, 1660, the princess Henrietta goes to St\r\nJames’s for fear of the smallpox. On the 16th January, 1660 (? 1661), “the\r\nprincess is recovered of the measles.” Letters from a lady at Hambleton to\r\nher husband in London, May 26, 1661, speaks of smallpox raging in the\r\nplace, and in the house of her nearest neighbour, her own children having\r\nthe whooping-cough. In the bills of mortality of those years the deaths in\r\nLondon from smallpox and measles were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1647      139\r\n  1648      401\r\n  1649     1190\r\n  1650      184\r\n  1651      525\r\n  1652     1279\r\n  1653      139\r\n  1654      832\r\n  1655     1294\r\n  1656      823\r\n  1657      835\r\n  1658      409\r\n  1659     1523\r\n  1660      354\r\n  1661     1246\r\n  1662      768\r\n  1663      411\r\n  1664     1233\r\n  1665      655\r\n  1666       38\r\n\r\nThese figures bring us down to the period of Sydenham, who was the first\r\naccurate observer of smallpox in London. With his writings, and with those\r\nof Willis and Morton, we begin a new era in the history of epidemics in\r\nEngland. We find, for the first time in the history, an adequate\r\ndiscussion of the epidemiological and clinical facts by the ablest men in\r\nthe profession. But, as the new era is at one and the same time marked by\r\nthe cessation of plague and by the enormous increase of various fevers, as\r\nwell as of smallpox, it falls without the limits of this volume, making,\r\nindeed, the appropriate beginning of the new kind of epidemic history\r\nwhich is characteristic of England from the Restoration and the Revolution\r\ndown to the end of the 18th century. It is clear, from the instances\r\nabove given, that smallpox was already at the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury becoming a pest among the upper classes. But to anyone who studies\r\nthe history over continuous periods it is equally clear that its\r\nprominence was then something new and that the horror and alarm which it\r\ncaused became greater as the 17th century approached its close. And so as\r\nnot to leave the history of smallpox at this point with a wrong impression\r\nof its general virulence, it may be added that Dr Plot, writing of\r\nOxfordshire in 1677, says: “Generally here they are so favorable and kind,\r\nthat be the nurse but tolerably good, the patient seldom miscarries[913].”\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox in Continental Writings of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nIt would be beside the purpose of this work to follow the history of\r\nsmallpox and measles on the continent of Europe. But it will be necessary\r\nto say a few words on the contemporary foreign writings upon these\r\ndiseases, as it is chiefly teaching from a foreign source that we detect\r\nin the English authors of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nIt might be inferred from the classical work of Fracastori[914], published\r\nin 1546, that smallpox and measles were frequent and familiar diseases in\r\nthe author’s experience at Verona. At the same time it is clear that even\r\nhe, original observer as he was, is in places merely repeating the old\r\nstatements of the Arabian writers. Thus his statement that everyone has\r\nsmallpox or measles sooner or later, is the old Arabian tradition or\r\nexperience, usually joined to the explanation that the cause of that\r\nuniversality was the nourishment of the foetus by the retained and impure\r\nmenstrual blood, so that all children had to free their constitutions of a\r\ncongenital impurity sooner or later. So far as Fracastori’s originality\r\ncomes in, it is clear that he does not regard smallpox and measles as\r\nserious troubles. In his second chapter he says:\r\n\r\n    “First we must treat of those contagious maladies which, although\r\n    contagious, are not called pestilential, because, for the most part,\r\n    they are salubrious. Of such are variolae and morbilli. By variolae\r\n    are understood those which are called also varollae by the common\r\n    people, from their likeness, I suppose, to the pustules called vari.\r\n    By morbilli are understood those which the common people style fersae,\r\n    so-called perhaps from _fervor_. But of these the Greeks do not appear\r\n    to have treated under any other name than exanthemata. They happen\r\n    principally in children, rarely in men, most rarely in old people. But\r\n    they seem to befall all men once in life, or to be apt to befall them\r\n    unless a premature death removes the individual. In boys the malady is\r\n    more benign than in adults. For the more part, as already said, they\r\n    are salubrious, since this ebullition of the blood is something of a\r\n    purification of the same. It afflicts more or less according to the\r\n    density of the blood and as the vice is apt or not to be separated\r\n    from it. If the blood be more pituitous, the pustules are variform,\r\n    white, round and full of a kind of mucus; but if it be more bilious\r\n    the pustules break forth more of a dry sort. Where the disease has\r\n    happened once it is not apt to recur; but there are cases where it has\r\n    happened more than once.”\r\n\r\nIn the brief account by Fracastori, all the points are stated for measles\r\nand smallpox together; and the opinion is twice put forward that an attack\r\nwas salubrious as purifying the blood or as freeing it from some vice--an\r\nopinion which is still popularly held.\r\n\r\nIt is not until the latter half of the 16th century that we come to real\r\nepidemiological records of smallpox on the Continent,--the works by\r\nDonatus on smallpox and measles at Mantua in 1567, and by Betera upon\r\nepidemics at Brescia in 1570, 1577 and 1588, in which the more malignant\r\ntypes of smallpox were seen[915]. The treatise most used was that of\r\nAlphanus, published at Naples in 1577[916]; it was on plague and\r\npestilential fever, with an appendix on smallpox. Either it or Ambroise\r\nParé’s chapters seem to have furnished the greater part of the English\r\nessay by Kellwaye on the plague and smallpox.\r\n\r\nIn Ambroise Paré’s references to smallpox there occurs one singular line\r\nof remark which will serve to bring us back to etymology and to the great\r\npox[917]. The _petite vérole_, he says, has a resemblance to the _grosse\r\nvérole_ as sometimes attacking the bones. He had seen that in smallpox\r\ncases not only in 1568 but on other occasions: and he gives the details of\r\ntwo cases of smallpox, apparently with periostitis and necrosis, which he\r\ncompares to cases of the great pox. To express in one word the meaning of\r\nsuch cases, he says, the smallpox and _rougeolle_, not having been well\r\npurged, give rise to various troublesome accidents, as the great pox does.\r\nOne cannot read Paré’s chapters on the _grosse vérole_ and the _petite\r\nvérole_ without detecting an inclination to compare them or class them\r\ntogether in nosological characters. The comparison or classification is by\r\nno means explicit; but it seems to be in his thoughts, and he would seem,\r\naccordingly, to have held until a late period of the 16th century a view\r\nof the two diseases which was not unusual at the beginning of that century\r\n(as in the treatise of Pinctor and in the accounts of the dreadful\r\nmortality of Indians in Hispaniola and Mexico[918]), and was expressed in\r\nthe popular names given to each disease in France and in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPLAGUE, FEVER AND INFLUENZA FROM THE ACCESSION OF THE STUART DYNASTY TO\r\nTHE RESTORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last period of plague in England, from 1603 to its extinction in 1666,\r\nwas as fatal as any that the capital, and the provincial towns, had known\r\nsince the 14th century. The mortalities in London in 1603, 1625, and 1665\r\nare the greatest in the whole history of the City’s epidemics, not,\r\nperhaps, relatively to the population, but in absolute numbers. The\r\ncapital was growing rapidly, having now become the greatest trading\r\ncommunity in Europe. The dangers which were foreseen in the proclamation\r\nof 1580, of an extension of the City’s borders beyond civic control, had\r\nbeen realized. The old walled city, like Vienna down to a quite recent\r\ndate, remained both the residential quarter and the centre of trade and\r\ncommerce: the original suburbs, which were in the Liberties or Freedom of\r\nthe City, were the slums--the fringe of poverty covered by the poorest\r\nclass of tenements, unpaved and without regular streets, but penetrated by\r\nalleys twisting and turning in an endless maze. The City was not, indeed,\r\nwithout a good deal of building of the same class, especially in the\r\nparish of St Stephen, Coleman Street, the most populous parish within the\r\nwalls. But what was an occasional thing in the City where gardens and\r\nother open spaces had been built upon, was the rule in the parishes beyond\r\nthe walls. It was in the Liberties and outparishes that the plague of 1603\r\nbegan; its origin in 1625 is less certain; but there can be no question\r\nas to the gradual progress of the Great Plague of 1665 from the west end\r\nof the town down Holborn and the Strand to the City, to the great parishes\r\non the north-east and east, and across the water to Southwark. From one\r\npoint of view we may represent the later plagues as incidents in the\r\ntransition from the medieval to the modern state of the capital--a\r\ntransition which proceeded slowly and is still unfinished so far as\r\nconcerns the forms of municipal government. The history of the public\r\nhealth of London is, for nearly two centuries, the history of irregular\r\nand uncontrolled expansion, of the failure of old municipal institutions\r\nto overtake new duties. Perhaps if Wren’s grand conception of a New London\r\nafter the fire of 1666 had been taken up and given effect to by Charles\r\nII., the Liberties and suburbs might have been joined more organically to\r\nthe centre and have benefited by the municipal traditions of the latter.\r\nThe history of the public health in London during the latter part of the\r\n17th century and the whole of the 18th might in that case have been a less\r\nmelancholy record. That history falls within our next volume; but as it\r\nbegan with the expansion of London under Elizabeth and the Stuarts, this\r\nis the place to review the growth of the City from the time when it broke\r\nthrough its medieval limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Growth of London in the Tudor and Stuart Periods[919].\r\n\r\nThe accession of James I. to the English crown in 1603 corresponds in time\r\nwith the pretensions of London to be the first city in Europe. “London,”\r\nsays Dekker, in _The Wonderfull Yeare_, “was never in the highway to\r\npreferment till now. For she saw herself in better state than Jerusalem,\r\nshe went more gallant than ever did Antwerp, was more courted by amorous\r\nand lustie suitors than Venice (the minion of Italy); more lofty towers\r\nstood about her temples than ever did about the beautiful forehead of\r\nRome; Tyre and Sydon to her were like two thatcht houses to Theobals, the\r\ngrand Cairo but a hogsty.” That is, of course, in Dekker’s manner; but it\r\ncan be shown by figures that London took a great start in the end of\r\nElizabeth’s reign and grew still faster under James.\r\n\r\nFrom Richard I. to Henry VII., London was the medieval walled city, as\r\nDrayton says, “built on a rising bank within a vale to stand,” with a\r\npopulation between 40,000 and 50,000. Without the walls lay a few city\r\nparishes or parts of parishes, including the three dedicated to St Botolph\r\noutside Aldgate, Bishopsgate and Aldersgate, respectively, and St Giles’s\r\nwithout Cripplegate, all of these being at the gates or close to the\r\nwalls. On the western side, however, lay an extensive but sparsely\r\npopulated suburb, which was erected in 1393 into the Ward of Farringdon\r\nWithout; it extended westward from the city wall as far as Temple Bar,\r\nHolborn Bars and West Smithfield, and was divided into the four great\r\nparishes of St Sepulchre’s without Newgate; St Andrew’s, on the other side\r\nof Holborn valley, St Dunstan’s in the West (about Chancery Lane and\r\nFetter Lane), and St Bride’s, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known bills of mortality, in 1532 and 1535, from which a\r\npopulation of some 62,400 might be deduced, show that the St Botolph\r\nparishes, St Giles’s without Cripplegate and the four great parishes in\r\nthe western Liberties (or, more correctly, in the ward of Farringdon\r\nWithout) had one-third of the whole deaths, and presumably about one-third\r\nof the whole population. In the few memoranda left of the plague-bills of\r\n1563, we find evidence that the population had increased to some 93,276,\r\nof which about a sixth or seventh part, or some 12,000 to 15,000 was in\r\nthe “out-parishes,” or in the parishes not only beyond the walls, but\r\nbeyond the Bars of the Freedom. The most valuable series of statistics for\r\nElizabethan London are those which give the christenings and burials for\r\nfive years from 1578 to 1582; from those of the year 1580, which was\r\nalmost free from the disturbing element of plague, a population of some\r\n123,034 may be deduced by taking the birth-rate at 29 per 1000 living and\r\nthe death-rate at 23 per 1000, or in each case at a favourable rate\r\ncorresponding to the large excess of births over deaths.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough left of the introduction to these old manuscript\r\nabstracts of weekly births and deaths to show how many parishes they\r\nrelate to, or what is the proportion for each division of the capital.\r\nBut, as the earlier series of bills of mortality from 1563 to 1566\r\nincluded the City, the Liberties and the out-parishes, it is probable that\r\nthe series from 1578 to 1582 had done the same. The crowding of the\r\nLiberties with a poor class of tenements, and the extension of the\r\nout-parishes, are otherwise known from the preamble to the proclamation of\r\n1580, which prohibited all building on new sites within three miles of the\r\nCity wall. The next figures are for the years 1593, 1594, and 1595, which\r\nshow a population increased to about 152,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the figures of the plague-year, 1593, it appears that the mortality\r\nwithin the walls, both from plague and from ordinary causes, had now\r\nbecome the smaller half, or somewhat less than that “without the walls and\r\nin the Liberties,”--a phrase which is used loosely, even in some official\r\nbills, for both Liberties and suburbs. In 1604 we have the exact\r\nproportions of deaths in the City, in the Liberties and in the\r\nout-parishes respectively:\r\n\r\n                |96 parishes |16 parishes |8 parishes out| Total\r\n                |within walls|in Liberties|of the Freedom|\r\n  --------------|------------|------------|--------------|------\r\n  All deaths    |   1798     |    2465    |    956       |  5219\r\n  Plague deaths |    280     |     368    |    248       |   896\r\n  Christenings  |     --     |      --    |     --       |  5458\r\n\r\nThe sixteen parishes of the Liberties are now decidedly ahead of the\r\nninety-six old City parishes, while the eight out-parishes have some 18\r\nper cent. of the whole mortality. The population is best reckoned from the\r\n6504 baptisms of the year after, 1605, by which time the disturbance of\r\nthe enormous mortality in 1603 had ceased to be felt; at a birth-rate of\r\n29 per 1000, the population would be some 224,275. The proportions in\r\n1605, from the bills of mortality for the year, are 33·8 per cent. in the\r\nCity, 50 per cent. in the Liberties, and 16·2 per cent. in the\r\nout-parishes; so that the City would have contained in that year about\r\n76,000, the Liberties about 114,000, and the out-parishes about 37,000. To\r\nthose numbers we should have to add some 20,000 or 30,000 for\r\nWestminster, Stepney, Lambeth, Newington, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Graunt’s contemporary estimate for 1662, the population had\r\ngrown to 460,000, or to rather more than double that of 1605; and whereas\r\nthe proportion in 1605 was two-sixths in the City, three-sixths in the\r\nLiberties and one-sixth in the out-parishes, he makes it in 1662 to have\r\nbeen one-fifth in the City, three-fifths in the Liberties (including\r\nSouthwark) and the out-parishes nearest to the Bars, and one-fifth in the\r\nout-parishes of Stepney, Redriff, Newington, Lambeth, Islington and\r\nHackney, with the city of Westminster. Thus, whereas in 1535 the City had\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole estimated population, in 1662 it had one-fifth;\r\nbut with its one-fifth in 1662 it was twice as crowded as with its\r\ntwo-thirds in 1535, the comparatively open appearance given to it by\r\ngardens in various localities, as on Tower Hill, having entirely gone.\r\n\r\nAs early as the plague of 1563, the Liberties were observed to be first\r\ninfected, and to retain the infection longest; that is alleged of St\r\nSepulchre’s parish by Dr John Jones, from personal knowledge. The history\r\nof the plague of 1593 is imperfectly known; but it is clear from Stow’s\r\nsummation of the deaths during the year, that more died of plague in the\r\nLiberties and suburbs than in the City. Of the next plague, that of 1603,\r\nwe know that it did begin in the Liberties and was prevalent in those\r\nskirts of the City for some time before it entered the gates. “Death,”\r\nsays _The Wonderfull Yeare_, “had pitcht his tents in the sinfully\r\npolluted suburbs ... the skirts of London were pitifully pared off by\r\nlittle and little; which they within the gates perceiving,” etc. Then the\r\nplague, represented as an invading force, “entered within the walls and\r\nmarched through Cheapside,” the wealthier inhabitants having escaped\r\nmeanwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Plague of 1603.\r\n\r\nThe most useful document for the London plague of 1603 is a printed Bill\r\nof Mortality which is in the Guildhall Library. The bill, which is in the\r\nform of a broadside, is for the week 13-20 October, and purports to be a\r\ntrue copy, according to the report made to the king by the Company of\r\nParish Clerks, and printed by John Winder, printer to the honourable City\r\nof London[920]. It is necessary to be thus particular, because the clerk\r\nof the Company of Parish Clerks in the end of 1665 (between the Plague and\r\nthe Fire) published an account of all the statistics of former plagues\r\npreserved in his office, and emphatically denied that the Parish Clerks\r\ngave in an accompt for the year 1603; they did not resume their series\r\nafter 1595, he says, until 29th December, 1603. But the clerk was\r\nmistaken, as even the most prim of officials will sometimes be. The\r\nprinted bill which has come down to us gives the usual weekly return of\r\ndeaths from all causes in one column and those from plague in another, for\r\neach of the 96 parishes within their walls, each of the 16 parishes in the\r\nLiberties and each of 8 out-parishes. On the right hand margin it gives\r\nalso a summary statement of the deaths in “the first great plague in our\r\nmemory” that of 1563, which is the same as in Stow’s _Annales_, and of the\r\ndeaths in the next great plague, that of 1593, which differs considerably\r\nfrom Stow’s. It then goes on to give the sum of the figures of the year\r\n1603 from 17th December, 1602, and carries the deaths per week from 21st\r\nJuly down to date, the 20th of October, adding some information for the\r\nparishes which kept separate bills, namely, Westminster, the Savoy,\r\nStepney, Newington Butts, Islington, Lambeth and Hackney. This extant\r\nweekly bill was probably one of a series; for Graunt, in his book of 1662,\r\ncites various figures of weekly baptisms throughout the year 1603 which\r\nwould appear to have been taken from the bills for the respective weeks.\r\nBut the returns had not been made regularly from all the parishes within\r\nthe Bills from the beginning of the year 1603. The reason why the weekly\r\nfigures are not recapitulated farther back than the week ending July 21,\r\nis that the outparishes had not sent in their returns until that week.\r\nFrom another source, we know the figures for the City and Liberties from\r\nMarch 10 to July 14, and from the same source we obtain the totals for all\r\nparishes within the Bills from October 19 to the end of the year. By\r\nputting these figures into one table, we may represent the mortality of\r\n1603, not indeed completely, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Weekly Mortalities in London during the plague of 1603._\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n            |    City and   |\r\n            |   Liberties.  | Out parishes. |    Totals.\r\n     Week   |---------------|---------------|---------------\r\n    ending  |  All  |       |  All  |       |  All  |\r\n            |causes.|Plague.|causes.|Plague.|causes.|Plague.\r\n  ----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------\r\n  March 17  |  108  |    3  |       |       |       |\r\n        24  |   60  |    2  |       |       |       |\r\n        31  |   78  |    6  |       |       |       |\r\n  April  7  |   66  |    4  |       |       |       |\r\n        14  |   79  |    4  |       |       |       |\r\n        21  |   98  |    8  |       |       |       |\r\n        28  |  109  |   10  |       |       |       |\r\n  May    5  |   90  |   11  |       |       |       |\r\n        12  |  112  |   18  |       |       |       |\r\n        19  |  122  |   22  |       |       |       |\r\n        26  |  112  |   30  |       |       |       |\r\n  June   2  |  114  |   30  |       |       |       |\r\n         9  |  134  |   43  |       |       |       |\r\n        15  |  144  |   59  |       |       |       |\r\n        23  |  182  |   72  |       |       |       |\r\n        30  |  267  |  158  |       |       |       |\r\n  July   7  |  445  |  263  |       |       |       |\r\n        14  |  612  |  424  |       |       |       |\r\n        21  |  867  |  646  |  319  |  271  | 1186  |  917\r\n        28  | 1312  | 1025  |  398  |  354  | 1710  | 1379\r\n  Aug.   4  | 1700  | 1439  |  537  |  464  | 2237  | 1901\r\n        11  | 1655  | 1372  |  410  |  361  | 2065  | 1733\r\n        18  | 2486  | 2199  |  568  |  514  | 3054  | 2713\r\n        25  | 2343  | 2091  |  510  |  448  | 2853  | 2539\r\n  Sept.  1  | 2798  | 2495  |  587  |  542  | 3385  | 3037\r\n         8  | 2583  | 2283  |  495  |  441  | 3078  | 2724\r\n        15  | 2676  | 2411  |  433  |  407  | 3109  | 2818\r\n        22  | 2080  | 1851  |  376  |  344  | 2456  | 2195\r\n        29  | 1666  | 1478  |  295  |  254  | 1961  | 1732\r\n  Oct.   6  | 1528  | 1367  |  306  |  274  | 1834  | 1641\r\n        13  | 1109  |  962  |  203  |  184  | 1312  | 1146\r\n        20  |  647  |  546  |  119  |   96  |  766  |  642\r\n        27  |       |       |       |       |  625  |  508\r\n  Nov.   3  |       |       |       |       |  737  |  594\r\n        10  |       |       |       |       |  545  |  442\r\n        17  |       |       |       |       |  384  |  257\r\n        24  |       |       |       |       |  198  |  105\r\n  Dec.   1  |       |       |       |       |  223  |  102\r\n         8  |       |       |       |       |  163  |   55\r\n        15  |       |       |       |       |  200  |   96\r\n        22  |       |       |       |       |  168  |   74\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese figures may be accepted as real, so far as they go; and they give a\r\ntotal (37,192 from all causes, whereof of the plague, 30,519) which is\r\nnearly the same as that usually taken, e.g. by Graunt, for the mortality\r\nof the whole year in all London (37,294 from all causes, whereof of the\r\nplague, 30,561). But it is clear that important additions have to be made.\r\nIn the first place, no deaths are included for the weeks previous to March\r\n10. In the second place, no deaths are included from the out-parishes\r\n(within the Bills), previous to July 14. In the third place, no deaths at\r\nall are included from Westminster, Stepney, Newington, Lambeth, etc. These\r\nomissions have to be kept in mind when the plague of 1603 is compared with\r\nthose of 1625 and 1665, for which the figures are fully ascertained; and\r\nwe possess various data from which to supply them approximately. One great\r\naddition, with nothing conjectural in it, is for the seven parishes\r\noutside the general bill of mortality, Stepney being the largest: they\r\nkept their own bills, and the figures from them, for the principal part of\r\nthe year, are given on the margin of the broadside, as quoted below[921].\r\nAnother unconjectural addition is the mortality from all causes in the\r\nCity and Liberties from December 17, 1602, to March 10, 1603, which was\r\n1375, having been mostly non-plague deaths. All these deaths, actually\r\nknown, bring the total for the year up to 42,945 whereof of the plague\r\nabout 33,347. The farther additions, which can only be guessed, are the\r\nmortality from all causes in the eight out-parishes (within the Bills)\r\nprevious to July 14, and the mortality in the seven other suburban\r\nlocalities (Westminster, Stepney, etc.) before and after the dates stated\r\nin the note for each. Only the former of these additions would have been a\r\nconsiderable figure, the plague being already at 271 deaths a week when\r\nthe reckoning begins. Thus the totals, 42,945 burials from all causes, and\r\nfrom plague alone, 33,347, are well within the reality.\r\n\r\nSome details are extant of the incidence of the disease in particular\r\nparishes at certain dates. Thus, in the great parish of Stepney, which\r\nextended from Shoreditch to Blackwall, 650 plague-deaths, and 24 from\r\nother causes, took place in the single month of September; so that, if the\r\nplague began in Stepney about the 25th of March, it had not come to a head\r\nuntil autumn. In St Giles’s Cripplegate, the burials entered in the parish\r\nregister for the whole year are 2879, the highest mortality having been in\r\nthe beginning of September, when the burials on three successive days were\r\n36, 26 and 26[922]. In the week 13 to 20 October, for which the printed\r\nbill is extant, the proportions of the City, Liberties and 8 out-parishes\r\nrespectively were, for the week, 351, 296, and 119. Of the parishes\r\nwithout the walls, the most infected were, in their order at that date, St\r\nSepulchre’s, St Saviour’s, Southwark, St Andrew’s, Holborn, St Giles’s,\r\nCripplegate, St Clement’s Danes, St Giles’s in the Fields, St Olave’s,\r\nSouthwark, St Martin’s in the Fields, St Mary’s, Whitechapel and St\r\nLeonard’s, Shoreditch. For St Olave’s, Southwark, we have some particulars\r\nof the plague from the minister of the parish.\r\n\r\nIn a dialogue conveying various instructions on the plague[923], to his\r\nparishioners of St Olave’s, James Bamford states that 2640 had died in\r\nthat parish from May 7 to the date of writing (October 13), and that the\r\nburials had fallen from 305 in a week to 51, and from 57 in a day to 4. St\r\nOlave’s was a typical parish of the new London. It extended eastwards\r\nalong the Surrey bank of the river from London Bridge, and had been\r\nalmost all built within the half-century since the purchase of the Borough\r\nof Southwark by the City from the Crown in 1550. In Stow’s _Survey_ of\r\n1598 the parish is thus described: “Then from the bridge along by the\r\nThames eastward is St Olave’s Street, having continual building on both\r\nthe sides, with lanes and alleys, up to Battle Bridge, to Horsedown and\r\ntowards Rotherhithe some good half mile in length from London Bridge”--the\r\nBermondsey High Street running south from the Horsleydown end of it. St\r\nOlave’s Church, he continues, stood on the bank of the river, “a fair and\r\nmeet large church, but a far larger parish, especially of aliens or\r\nstrangers, and poor people.” A mansion of former times, St Leger House,\r\nwas now “divided into sundry tenements.” Over against the church, the\r\ngreat house that was once the residence of the prior of Lewes, was now the\r\nWalnut Tree inn, a common hostelry.\r\n\r\nLondon was now so extensive in area that it becomes of interest to know in\r\nwhat part of it the plague broke out, and in what course the infection\r\nproceeded. These things are known for the plague of 1665; but for that of\r\n1603 they cannot be ascertained precisely. Dekker is emphatic that it\r\nbegan in the suburbs. The earliest reference to it in the State papers is\r\nunder the date of April 18, when the Lord Mayor wrote to the Lord\r\nTreasurer to inform him of the steps taken to prevent the spread of the\r\nplague in the counties of Middlesex and Surrey. “The parishes in Middlesex\r\nand Surrey” was an expression which afterwards came to mean a group of\r\ntwelve out-parishes beyond the Bars of the Freedom, including St Giles’s\r\nin the Fields, Lambeth, Newington and Bermondsey, Stepney, Whitechapel,\r\nShoreditch and Clerkenwell, Islington, Hackney and two others. The phrase\r\nused by the mayor may not have had so definite a meaning in 1603, but he\r\ncan hardly have intended it to apply to the City and Liberties of London,\r\nalthough those were the only divisions of the capital directly under his\r\nown jurisdiction. The parish which is associated with the earliest date,\r\nin the summary of the epidemic in the broadside of 1603, is Stepney, where\r\nthe record of deaths from plague and other causes begins from 25th March.\r\nIt would perhaps be safe to conclude that the plague of 1603 began at the\r\nextreme east in Stepney, as that of 1665 certainly did at the extreme west\r\nin St Giles’s in the Fields.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Table shows that the eight out-parishes had reached\r\na higher plague mortality relative to their population on July 21, than\r\nthe parishes within the bars of the Freedom: but the maximum of deaths\r\nfalls in both divisions about the same week. We may take it that the\r\nplague broke out in one of the suburbs; and as Dekker speaks of the flight\r\nhaving been westwards, the evidence points on the whole to an eastern\r\nsuburb, perhaps Whitechapel or Stepney. March is clearly indicated by\r\nvarious things as a time when plague-deaths began to attract notice; and\r\nthat date of commencement is corroborated by the following passage from\r\nthe essay of Graunt, based, it would seem, upon a series of weekly\r\nbills:--\r\n\r\n“We observe as followeth, viz. First, that (when from December 1602 to\r\nMarch following there was little or no plague) then the christenings at a\r\nmedium were between 110 and 130 per week, few weeks being above the one or\r\nbelow the other; but when the plague increased from thence to July, that\r\nthen the christenings decreased to under 90.... (3) Moreover we observe\r\nthat from the 21st July to the 12th October, the plague increasing reduced\r\nthe christenings to 70 at a medium. Now the cause of this must be flying,\r\nand death of teeming women” &c.--the total christenings of the year 1603\r\nhaving been only 4789, as against some 6000 in the year before the plague,\r\nand 5458 in the year after it.\r\n\r\nThis prevalence of plague in the suburbs and liberties of the City in the\r\nspring of 1603 coincides with great political events. Queen Elizabeth died\r\nat Richmond on the 24th of March, and was buried at Westminster on the\r\n28th of April; according to Dekker, “never did the English nation behold\r\nso much black worn as there was at her funeral.” The approach of king\r\nJames from Scotland appears to have caused an outburst of gaiety, his\r\naccession to the crown, according to the same writer, having led to a\r\nmarked revival of trade: “Trades that lay dead and rotten started out of\r\ntheir trance.... There was mirth in everyone’s face, the streets were\r\nfilled with gallants, tabacconists filled up whole taverns, vintners hung\r\nout spick and span new ivy-bushes (because they wanted good wine), and\r\ntheir old rain-beaten lattices marched under other colours, having lost\r\nboth company and colour before.” James made a slow progress from Scotland,\r\npaying visits on the way. He arrived at Theobalds, near Cheshunt, on the\r\n3rd of May, and was at Greenwich before the end of the month. On May 29, a\r\nproclamation was issued commanding gentlemen to depart the court and city\r\non account of the plague. On June 23, the remainder of Trinity law term\r\nwas adjourned. On July 10, a letter (one of the series between J.\r\nChamberlain and Dudley Carleton) says: “Paul’s grows very thin [the church\r\naisles where people were wont to meet to exchange news], for every man\r\nshrinks away. Our pageants are pretty forward, but most of them are such\r\nsmall-timbered gentlemen that they cannot last long, and I doubt, if the\r\nplague cease not sooner, they will riot and sink where they stand.” The\r\nCoronation was shorn of its full splendour. On July 18, it was announced\r\nthat, as the king could not pass through the City--the traditional route\r\nbeing from the Tower to Westminster--all the customary services by the way\r\nare to be performed between Westminster Bridge and the Abbey. The\r\nceremony, thus shortened, took place on July 25. On August 8, it was\r\nordered that all fairs within fifty miles of London should be suspended,\r\nthe more important being Bartholomew fair at Smithfield, and Stourbridge\r\nfair near Cambridge. The new Spanish ambassador was unable to approach the\r\nking, who moved from place to place,--Hampton Court, Woodstock and\r\nSouthampton.\r\n\r\nThese are the traces left by this great epidemic in the state papers of\r\nthe time. As in the case of the sweating sickness of 1485, which was in\r\nLondon while the preparations were going on for Henry VII.’s coronation,\r\nwe should hardly have known from public documents that the City was in a\r\nstate of panic. But in 1603 we are come to a period when other sources of\r\ninformation are available. It remains to put together what descriptions\r\nhave come down to us of the City of the Plague.\r\n\r\nThe most graphic touches are those left by Thomas Dekker, the dramatist,\r\nof whom it has been said that “he knew London as well as Dickens[924].”\r\nTo describe first the condition of the “sinfully polluted suburbs,” he\r\ntakes a walk through the still and melancholy streets in the dead hours of\r\nthe night. He hears from every house the loud groans of raving sick men,\r\nthe struggling pangs of souls departing, grief striking an alarum,\r\nservants crying out for masters, wives for husbands, parents for children,\r\nchildren for their mothers. Here, he meets some frantically running to\r\nknock up sextons; there, others fearfully sweating with coffins, to steal\r\nforth dead bodies lest the fatal handwriting of death should seal up their\r\nhouses. This would have been an evasion of the order, dating from 1547,\r\nthat no bodies were to be buried between six in the evening and six in the\r\nmorning--an order which was exactly reversed in the plague of 1665.\r\n\r\nWhen morning comes, a hundred hungry graves stand gaping, and everyone of\r\nthem, as at a breakfast, hath swallowed down ten or eleven lifeless\r\ncarcases; before dinner, in the same gulf are twice so many more devoured,\r\nand before the sun takes his rest these numbers are doubled,--threescore\r\nbodies lying slovenly tumbled together in a muck-pit[925]! One gruesome\r\nstory he tells of a poor wretch in the Southwark parish of St Mary Overy,\r\nwho was thrown for dead upon a heap of bodies in the morning, and in the\r\nafternoon was found gasping and gaping for life. Others were thrust out of\r\ndoors by cruel masters, to die in the fields and ditches, or in the common\r\ncages or under stalls. A boy sick of the plague was put on the water in a\r\nwherry to come ashore wherever he could, but landing was denied him by an\r\narmy of brown-bill men that kept the shore, so that he had to be taken\r\nwhence he came to die in a cellar. The sextons made their fortunes,\r\nespecially those of St Giles’s, Cripplegate, of St Sepulchre’s, outside\r\nNewgate, of St Olave’s in Southwark, of St Clement’s at Temple Bar, and\r\nof Stepney. Herb-wives and gardeners also prospered; the price of flowers,\r\nherbs, and garlands rose wonderfully, insomuch that rosemary, which had\r\nwont to be sold for twelve pence an armful, went now for six shillings a\r\nhandful.\r\n\r\nWhile plague was thus raging in the poor skirts of the City, “paring them\r\noff by little and little,” the well-to-do within the walls took alarm and\r\nfled, “some riding, some on foot, some without boots, some in slippers, by\r\nwater, by land, swarm they westwards. Hackneys, watermen and waggons were\r\nnot so terribly employed many a year; so that within a short time there\r\nwas not a good horse in Smithfield, nor a coach to be set eyes on.” But\r\nthey might just as well have remained as trust themselves to the\r\n“unmerciful hands of the country hard-hearted hobbinolls.” The sight of a\r\nLondoner’s flat-cap was dreadful to a lob: a treble ruff threw a whole\r\nvillage into a sweat. A crow that had been seen on a sunshiny day standing\r\non the top of Powles would have been better than a beacon on fire, to have\r\nraised all the towns within ten miles of London for the keeping her out.\r\nOne Londoner set out for Bristol, thinking not to see his home again this\r\nside Christmas. But forty miles from town the plague came upon him, and he\r\nsought entrance to an inn. When his case was known, the doors of the inn\r\n“had their wooden ribs crushed to pieces by being beaten together; the\r\ncasements were shut more close than an usurer’s greasy velvet pouch; the\r\ndrawing windows were hanged, drawn, and quartered; not a crevice but was\r\nstopt, not a mouse-hole left open.” The host and hostess tumbled over each\r\nother in their flight, the maids ran out into the orchard, the tapster\r\ninto the cellar. The unhappy Londoner was helped by a fellow-citizen who\r\nappeared on the scene, and was carried to die on a truss of straw in the\r\ncorner of a field; but the parson and the clerk refused him burial, and he\r\nwas laid in a hole where he had died. According to Stow, Bamford, and\r\nDavies of Hereford, such experiences of fugitive Londoners were repeated\r\neverywhere in the country, and Dekker gives several other tales of the\r\nsame sort “to shorten long winter nights.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dekker goes on, the plague had entered the gates of the City\r\nand marched through Cheapside; men, women, and children dropped down\r\nbefore him, houses were rifled, streets ransacked, rich men’s coffers\r\nbroken open and shared amongst prodigal heirs and unworthy servants. Every\r\nhouse looked like St Bartholomew’s Hospital and every street like\r\nBucklersbury: (“the whole street called Bucklersbury,” says Stow, “on both\r\nsides throughout is possessed of grocers, and apothecaries towards the\r\nwest end thereof”), for poor Mithridaticum and Dragon-water were bought in\r\nevery corner, and yet were both drunk every hour at other men’s cost. “I\r\ncould make your cheeks look pale and your hearts shake with telling how\r\nsome have had eighteen sores at one time running upon them, others ten or\r\ntwelve, many four and five; and how those that have been four times\r\nwounded by this year’s infection have died of the last wound, while\r\nothers, hurt as often, are now going about whole.” Funerals followed so\r\nclose that three thousand mourners went as if trooping together, with rue\r\nand wormwood stuffed into their ears and nostrils, looking like so many\r\nboars’ heads stuck with branches of rosemary. A dying man was visited by a\r\nfriendly neighbour, who promised to order the coffin; but he died himself\r\nan hour before his infected friend. A churchwarden in Thames Street, on\r\nbeing asked for space in the churchyard, answered mockingly that he wanted\r\nit for himself, and he did occupy it in three days.\r\n\r\nOne more extract from Dekker will bring us back to the strictly medical\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n    “Never let any man ask me what became of our Phisitions in this\r\n    massacre. They hid their synodical heads as well as the proudest, and\r\n    I cannot blame them, for their phlebotomies, losinges and electuaries,\r\n    with their diacatholicons, diacodions, amulets and antidotes, had not\r\n    so much strength to hold life and soul together as a pot of Pinder’s\r\n    ale and a nutmeg. Their drugs turned to durt, their simples were\r\n    simple things. Galen could do no more good than Sir Giles Goosecap.\r\n    Hippocrate, Avicen, Paracelsus, Rasis, Fernelius, with all their\r\n    succeeding rabble of doctors and water-casters, were at their wits’\r\n    end; for not one of them durst peep abroad.”\r\n\r\nOnly a band of desperadoes, he goes on, some few empirical madcaps--for\r\nthey could never be worth velvet caps--clapped their bills upon every\r\ndoor. But besides the empirical desperadoes, who dared the infection for\r\nthe sake of the golden harvest, some few physicians and surgeons remained\r\nat their post, or at least put out essays with prescriptions and rules of\r\nregimen. Three such books on the plague were published in London in 1603,\r\nof which the most notable was one by Dr Thomas Lodge[926], a poet like\r\nDekker himself, but of the academical school to which Dekker did not\r\nbelong. The passage quoted about the impotence of the faculty is perhaps\r\naimed at these books, which all abound with the sayings and maxims of\r\nHippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and the like, Lodge also quoting the more\r\nobscure name of Fernelius, which Dekker has not failed to seize upon.\r\n\r\nLodge confirms the statement about the empirical desperadoes clapping\r\ntheir bills upon every post. One of them, “who underwrit not his bills,”\r\nposted them close to Lodge’s house in Warwick Lane, so that the physician\r\nwas taken by the populace to be himself the advertiser. He was besieged\r\nwith applicants for his cordial waters, and wrote his book to make his own\r\nposition clear, being “aggrieved because of that loathsome imposition\r\nwhich was laid upon me to make myself vendible (which is unworthy a\r\nliberal and gentle mind, much more ill-beseeming a physician and\r\nphilosopher), who ought not to prostitute so sacred a profession so\r\nabjectly.” Farther confirming Dekker about the greed of the quacks as well\r\nas about the strictly business-like attitude of the regular profession, he\r\nspeaks of “my poor countrymen left without guide or counsel how to succour\r\nthemselves in extremity; for where the infection most rageth, there\r\npoverty reigneth among the commons, which, having no supplies to satisfy\r\nthe greedy desires of those that should attend them, are for the most part\r\nleft desolate to die without relief.” The reader must wonder, he says,\r\n“why, amongst so many excellent and learned physicians of this city, I\r\nalone have undertaken to answer the expectation of the multitude, and to\r\nbear the heavy burthen of contentious critiques and depravers.” The\r\nexplanation was that the regular faculty had for the most part gone out of\r\ntown, along with magistrates, ministers and rich men. Bamford, the\r\nminister of St Olave’s, Southwark, who remained at his post, has no excuse\r\nto offer for magistrates or for his clerical brethren, but he is extremely\r\nfair to the doctors: “As for physicians, I only propound this question:\r\nWhether they be bound in conscience to be resident, in regard of their\r\nprofession and ability to do good, or they may use their liberty for\r\nthemselves and (as they think) for their lives, in regard they are no\r\npublic persons and live (not by a common stipend but) by what they can\r\nget.”\r\n\r\nDr Lodge, who dated his book from Warwick Lane on August 19, or when the\r\nepidemic would have been at its height, had already won laurels in the\r\nfield of poetry and romance. He was an Oxonian (Trinity College, 1573) and\r\none of a set with Marlowe and Greene. “At length his mind growing\r\nserious,” says Anthony Wood, “he studied physic,” travelling abroad for\r\nthe purpose and graduating M.D. at Avignon. He had great success in\r\npractice, especially among Catholics, to whom he was suspected of\r\nbelonging. He died of the plague, during the next great epidemic of 1625,\r\nat Low Leyton in Essex. His book on the plague would be entitled to a\r\nplace in medical literature if only that its style is above the average of\r\nmedical compositions. I cannot forbear quoting the following collect for\r\nits structure and euphony:\r\n\r\n    “But before I prosecute this my intended purpose, let us invocate and\r\n    call upon that divine bounty, from whose fountain head of mercy every\r\n    good and gracious benefit is derived, that it will please him to\r\n    assist this my labor and charitable intent, and so to order the scope\r\n    of my indevour, that it may redound to his eternal glory, our\r\n    neighbours’ comfort, and the special benefit of our whole country;\r\n    which, being now under the fatherly correction of Almighty God, and\r\n    punished for our misdeeds by his heavy hand, may through the admirable\r\n    effects and fruits of the sacred art of physic, receive prevention of\r\n    their danger, and comfort in this desperate time of visitation. To him\r\n    therefore, King of kings, invisible and only wise, be all honor,\r\n    majesty and dominion, now and for ever. Amen.”\r\n\r\nIt is only in dealing with the more public aspects of the plague that\r\nLodge shows any individuality. So far as concerns causes,\r\nprognostications, symptoms, remedies, preventives, and precautions, there\r\nis little in his essay which is not to be found in the older plague-books,\r\nsuch as the 14th century one of the bishop of Aarhus, his anatomical\r\ndirections for blood-letting being word for word the same as the bishop’s.\r\nSome of his points are the same as in Skene’s Edinburgh essay of 1568,\r\nsuch as the indication of plague about to begin which is got from rats,\r\nmoles and other underground creatures forsaking their holes. To keep off\r\nthe infection he advises the wearing of small cakes of arsenic in the\r\narmpits, where the buboes usually came. That Paracelsist practice is known\r\nto have been tried at Zurich in 1564; it was one of the matters of dispute\r\nbetween the Galenists and the chemical physicians. During the plague of\r\n1603, Dr Peter Turner published a curious tract in defence of it[927].\r\n\r\nFrom a Venetian gentleman Lodge obtained also the formula of a\r\npreservative from infection, which contained, among other things,\r\ntormentilla root, white dittany, bole Armeniac and oriental pearl: “The\r\ngentleman that gave me this assured me that he had given it to many in the\r\ntime of the great plague in Venice, who, though continually conversant in\r\nthe houses of those that were infected, received no infection or prejudice\r\nby them.”\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on “The Order and Police that ought to be held in a City\r\nduring the Plague-time,” he advises the removal of the shambles from\r\nwithin the walls to some remote and convenient place near the river of\r\nThames, to the end that the blood and garbage of beasts that are killed\r\nmay be washed away with the tide. Lodge lived just on the other side of\r\nNewgate Street from the shambles, and could speak feelingly about them, as\r\nmany more had done since Edward III.’s time. The nobles of Aries, he says,\r\nhad acted so on the advice of Valenolaes, having built their\r\nslaughter-houses to the westward of the city upon the river of Rhone. The\r\nchief interest of the book is in the sections on preventing the spread of\r\ninfection. He quotes an instance from Alexander Benedetti of Venice, of a\r\nfeather-bed, slept on by one in the plague, having been laid aside for\r\nseven years, “and the first that slept upon the same at the end of the\r\nsame term was suddenly surprised with the plague.” His directions for the\r\ncleansing of houses, bedding, clothes, &c. are minute and thorough\r\n(Chapter XVII.)[928]. Modern readers will find his views on isolation and\r\ncompulsory removal to hospital worth noting. The Pest House, which had\r\nbeen lately built in the fields towards Finsbury, was then the only\r\nspecial hospital to which patients in the plague could be removed, and its\r\naccommodation was not great; the burials at it in the nine weeks from July\r\n21 to September 22, 1603, were respectively 18, 18, 12, 21, 12, 6, 5, 10\r\nand 10. The Bridewell near Fleet Street appears also to have admitted a\r\nsmall number of plague-cases, the burials from it in the five weeks from\r\nAugust 18 to September 22, having been respectively 8, 5, 17, 7 and 19.\r\nThere was also a pest-house in Tothill fields, for the Westminster end of\r\nthe town. Servants appear to have been mostly sent to these refuges. Lodge\r\nsaw that the principle of compulsory removal of the sick had no chance\r\nwithout more hospital accommodation (as Defoe also insisted in reviewing\r\nthe plague of 1665), and he proposes a plan for a pest-house with\r\n“twenty-eight to thirty separate chambers on the upper floor, and as many\r\nbeneath.” He is humanely alive to the hardships of compulsory isolation:\r\n\r\n    “For in truth it is a great amazement, and no less horror, to separate\r\n    the child from the father and mother, the husband from his wife, the\r\n    wife from her husband, and the confederate and friend from his\r\n    adherent and friend; and to speak my conscience in this matter, this\r\n    course ought not to be kept before that, by the judgment of a learned\r\n    physician, the sickness be resolved on. And when it shall be found it\r\n    is infectious, yet it is very needful to use humanity towards such as\r\n    are seized. And if their parents or friends have the means to succour\r\n    them, and that freely, and with a good heart they are willing to do\r\n    the same, those that have the charge to carry them to the pest-house\r\n    ought to suffer them to use that office of charity towards their sick,\r\n    yet with this condition that they keep them apart and suffer them not\r\n    to frequent and converse with such as are in health. For, to speak the\r\n    truth, one of the chiefest occasions of the death of such sick folks\r\n    (besides the danger of their disease) is the fright and fear they\r\n    conceive when they see themselves devoid of all succour, and, as it\r\n    were, ravished out of the hands of their parents and friends, and\r\n    committed to the trust of strangers.... And therefore in this cause\r\n    men ought to proceed very discreetly and modestly.”\r\n\r\nAnother London essay of the same year, by “S. H. Studious in Phisicke” is\r\na much slighter production. The author writes in a superior strain and\r\noffers advice “unto such Chirurgeons as shall be called or shall adventure\r\nthemselves to the care of this so dangerous sickness,” one piece of advice\r\nbeing not to let blood except at the beginning of the seizure, and to take\r\nthen five ounces of blood in the morning, and three ounces more at three\r\nin the afternoon, repeating the depletion next day at discretion. He\r\nstates also the theory of the plague-bubo: it was a way made by nature to\r\nexpel the venomous and corrupt matter which is noisome unto it. He advises\r\nthe practice of incising the bubo and of helping it to suppurate, which\r\nwas the treatment in the Black Death of 1348-49: if nature be “weak and\r\nnot able to expel the venom fast enough, by insensible transpiration the\r\nvenom returneth back to the heart and so presently destroyeth\r\nnature[929].”\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the state of medical practice and literature in\r\nEngland at the end of the Elizabethan period that the only other treatise\r\nwhich the plague of 1603 is known to have called forth was a\r\nmystification[930] under the name of one Thomas Thayre, chirurgian, “for\r\nthe benefite of his countrie, but chiefly for the honorable city of\r\nLondon,” elaborately dedicated to the Lord Mayor of the year (by name),\r\nthe Sheriffs and the Aldermen, to whom “Thomas Thayre wisheth all\r\nspirituall and temporal blessings.” It proves on examination to be a very\r\nclose reproduction, with some omissions at the end and a few additions,\r\nof the old Treatise of the Pestilence by Thomas Phayre or Phaer, first\r\npublished in 1547, and was probably the venture of some bookseller or\r\nliterary hack. The original treatise of Phayre had been reprinted last in\r\n1596, “latelye corrected and enlarged by Thomas Phayre,” although that\r\nwriter must have been dead many years. A reprint of some of “Dr Phaer’s”\r\nremedies and preservatives, without date, is conjecturally assigned to the\r\nyear 1601. The original work of Henry VIII.’s time was also a literary\r\ncompilation, in some parts copied verbatim from the 14th century book by\r\nthe Danish bishop of Arusia, and bears not a trace of first-hand\r\nobservation. Yet it had the fortune to be reprinted once more, in 1722, by\r\na physician W. T., who remarked that, as the writers on plague in his own\r\ntime “usually transcribe from others,” he wished to set before them a\r\nspecimen “of such as have written on a disease of which they were\r\neye-witnesses.”\r\n\r\nTwo printed addresses on the plague by London ministers are extant: one by\r\nHenoch Clapham, “to his ordinary hearers,” which is merely a sermon, in\r\nthe form of an epistle, to improve the occasion[931]; and the other by\r\nJames Bamford, rector of St Olave’s, Southwark, in the form of a dialogue,\r\nand full of practical and sensible advice[932]. Bamford’s tract is\r\nespecially directed against “that bloody error which denieth the\r\npestilence to be contagious; maintained not only by the rude multitude but\r\nby too many of the better sort;” and its chief medical interest lies in\r\nthe reasons with which he confutes that deadly heresy:--\r\n\r\n    “Do not the botches, blains and spots (called God’s tokens)\r\n    accompanied with raving and death, argue a stranger [sic] infection\r\n    than that of the leprosy, to be judged by botches and spots? [the\r\n    infectiousness of leprosy being proved by revelation, Lev. xiii.].\r\n    Doth not the ordinary experience of laying live pigeons to\r\n    plague-sores and taking them presently dead away, and that one after\r\n    another, demonstrate mortal infection? In that the plague rageth and\r\n    reigneth especially amongst the younger sort, and such as do not\r\n    greatly regard clean and sweet keeping, and where many are pestered\r\n    together in alleys and houses--is not this an argument of infection?\r\n    Thousands can directly tell where, when, and of whom they took the\r\n    infection.... Persons of a tender constitution or corrupt humours\r\n    sooner take the plague than those of a strong constitution and sound\r\n    bodies. The infirmities of many women in travail, and other diseases,\r\n    turn into the plague. We see few auncient people die in comparison of\r\n    children and the younger sort.\r\n\r\n    “Lastly, of those that keep a good diet, have clean and sweet keeping,\r\n    live in a good air, use reasonable and seasonable preservatives, and\r\n    be not pestered many in one house, or have convenient house-room for\r\n    their household--we see few infected in comparison of those that fail\r\n    in all these means of preservation and yet will thrust themselves into\r\n    danger.”\r\n\r\nThe plague of London in 1603 called forth also a poem by John Davies, a\r\nschoolmaster of Hereford. It is called “The Triumph of Death; or the\r\nPicture of the Plague, according to the Life, as it was in A.D.\r\n1603[933].” The description is by no means so concrete as the title would\r\nhave us believe, and might, indeed, have been taken, most of it, at\r\nsecond-hand from Dekker:--\r\n\r\n  “Cast out your dead, the carcass-carrier cries,\r\n   Which he by heaps in groundless graves inters ...\r\n   The London lanes, themselves thereby to save,\r\n   Did vomit out their undigested dead,\r\n   Who by cart-loads are carried to the grave,\r\n   For all those lanes with folk were overfed.”\r\n\r\nHe mentions that the prisoners in the gaols were comparatively exempt from\r\nplague[934]. One line suggests the great size that the plague-buboes\r\nsometimes reached:\r\n\r\n  “Here swells a botch as high as hide can hold.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps his particulars of the plague in the provinces, in 1603 and\r\nfollowing years, are from his own knowledge. Both the Universities, he\r\nsays, were forsaken.\r\n\r\n  “Each village free now stands upon her guard ...\r\n   The haycocks in the meads were oft opprest\r\n   With plaguy bodies, both alive and dead,\r\n   Which being used confounded man and beast.”\r\n\r\nOne incident he vouches for (in a marginal note) as having occurred at\r\nLeominster: A person with the plague was drowned to prevent infection, by\r\nthe order of Sir Herbert Croft, one of the Council of the Marches of\r\nWales.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plague of 1603 in the country near London.\r\n\r\nMost of the country parishes nearest to London had plague-burials in 1603,\r\ndoubtless from the escape of infected Londoners to them and from the\r\nspreading of the infection. In several of these parish registers[935] the\r\nplague-deaths in 1603 are more than in the time of the Great Plague of\r\n1665: there is a note in the Croydon register that “many died in the\r\nhighways near the city.” The following table shows the mortalities, great\r\nand small.\r\n\r\n                              Burials\r\n               Burials from    from\r\n               all causes.    plague.\r\n\r\n  Barking             381       --\r\n  Battersea            23       --\r\n  Beckenham            24       --\r\n  Bromley              26       --\r\n  Cheam                13        9\r\n  Chigwell             28       --\r\n  Chiselhurst          62       --\r\n  Clapham              20  mostly plague\r\n  Croydon              --      158\r\n  Deptford            235       --\r\n  Ealing              136       --\r\n  Edmonton            145       85\r\n  Eltham               52       17\r\n  Enfield             253      129\r\n  Finchley             51       38\r\n  Hackney             321      269\r\n  Hampstead             7       --\r\n  Isleworth            75       --\r\n  Islington           322       --\r\n  Kensington           32       --\r\n  Lambeth             566       --\r\n  Lewisham            117       --\r\n  Romford             122       --\r\n  Stratford           130       89\r\n  Streatham            36       --\r\n  Tottenham            79       44\r\n  Twickenham           --       67\r\n  Wandsworth           --      100\r\n  Wimbledon            21       --\r\n\r\nA comparison of these figures with those of 1665 will show that the\r\nnorthern parishes, Islington and Hackney, as well as parishes farther out\r\nin the country, such as Enfield, had more plague-deaths in 1603 than in\r\nthe time of the Great Plague. Also Barking, Stratford and Romford on the\r\none side, and Lewisham, Eltham and Croydon on the other, had heavier\r\nmortalities in the earlier year. It would appear, indeed, that the\r\ninfection in the country near London had been attracting notice before the\r\nplague in the capital caused any alarm. On April 18, 1603, the lord mayor\r\nwrote to the Privy Council concerning the steps that had been taken “to\r\nprevent the spread of the plague in the counties of Middlesex and Surrey.”\r\nOn July 20, 1603, the king issued a warrant to the constables and others\r\nof the hundred of Twyford in Kent, to levy a special rate on certain\r\nparishes to relieve the sufferers by a grievous plague in the villages of\r\nWest Malling, East Malling, Offham, and seven others[936]. Such rates were\r\nusually levied when an epidemic was nearly over; so that the outbreak in\r\nKent must have been at least as early as that in London.\r\n\r\nThe towns and villages of Hertfordshire, which were favourite resorts of\r\nLondoners in plague-time, had their share of the visitation in 1603. At\r\nGreat Amwell, there were 41 burials in the year, of which 19 were of the\r\nplague between August 19 and November 28, 6 of them in one day. Doubtless\r\nthe registers of other parishes in the home counties would show a similar\r\nhistory if they were searched[937].\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Plague in London after 1603.\r\n\r\nBefore following the plague of 1603 into the provinces, it will be\r\nconvenient to give the history of the infection in London for the next few\r\nyears. There was little plague in 1604 and not much in 1605; but in 1606\r\nthe infection again became active, and continued at its endemic level for\r\nsome five or six years. The following table, from the weekly bills of\r\nmortality, shows how regularly the infection came to a height in the\r\nautumn year after year, as if it had been a product of the soil[938]:\r\n\r\n_Table, from the Weekly Bills of Mortality (London), showing the increase\r\nof Plague in Autumn, for five successive years._\r\n\r\n                      1606   1607   1608   1609   1610\r\n\r\n  Total deaths from}\r\n    plague in the  }  2124   2352   2262   4240   1803\r\n        year       }\r\n\r\n  Weekly deaths in\r\n\r\n                   {    25     27     16     60     38\r\n                   {    33     33     26     57     45\r\n       July        {    50     37     24     58     45\r\n                   {    46     51     50     91     40\r\n                   {    66     43\r\n\r\n                   {    67     77     45    100     47\r\n                   {    75     69     70    126     50\r\n       August      {    85     76     79    101     73\r\n                   {    85     71     73    150     60\r\n                   {                        177     99\r\n\r\n                   {   116    105    123    141     96\r\n                   {   105    121    136    158     89\r\n       Sept.       {    92    114    107    210     86\r\n                   {    87    177    143    144     72\r\n                   {                 147\r\n\r\n                   {   141    150    103    154     63\r\n                   {   106    113    131    177     79\r\n       Oct.        {   117    110    124    131     59\r\n                   {   109     82    102     55     49\r\n                   {   101     68\r\n\r\n                   {    68     66    109     84     58\r\n                   {    41     55     72     69     40\r\n       Nov.        {    78     46     69     67     22\r\n                   {    72     21     70     59     42\r\n                   {                         51     39\r\n\r\nIn Dekker’s _Seven Deadly Sins of London_, published in 1606, he returns\r\nto the subject of the plague. He says that it still slays hundreds in a\r\nweek, a statement which will be seen to be an exaggeration by reference to\r\nthe Table. But, on another point, Dekker would have been correctly\r\ninformed. The playhouses, he says, stand empty, with the doors locked and\r\nthe flag taken down. The policy of forbidding plays during plague-time, or\r\nwhen the infection threatened to be active, was advocated by the Puritan\r\nclergy as early as 1577, and had been in force in the plague of 1563.\r\n“Plaies are banished for a time out of London,” says Harrison in 1572,\r\n“lest the resort unto them should ingender a plague, or rather disperse it\r\nbeing already begonne[939].” In a sermon preached at Paul’s Cross on\r\nSunday, November 3, 1577, in the time of the plague, by T. W., on the text\r\n“Woe to that abominable, filthy and cruel city,” the preacher exclaims,\r\n“Behold the sumptuous theatre-houses, a continual monument of London’s\r\nprodigal folly! But I understand they are now forbidden because of the\r\nplague[940].” By the year 1581 the lord mayor had become a zealous\r\nsupporter of the Puritan demands for the stopping of plays in the City and\r\nin the Liberties[941]. In July (?), 1603, James I. granted a licence to\r\nplayers for performances in the Curtain and Boar’s Head theatres, “as soon\r\nas the plague decreases to 30 deaths per week in London[942].” In the\r\nbeginning of winter, 1607, on the subsidence of plague, the theatres were\r\npermitted to be opened, so that the “poor players,” might make a living;\r\nbut as the plague revived in 1608, and became still more serious in 1609,\r\nit is tolerably certain that the theatres were shut during the whole\r\nsummer and autumn of those years.\r\n\r\nThose years, from 1606 to 1610, when the actor’s and dramatist’s\r\nprofession was seriously hindered by the fear of plague, correspond to a\r\nblank period in the personal history of Shakespeare. It has been\r\nconjectured that he retired from London for a time, before his final\r\nretirement to Stratford-on-Avon. At all events his occupation, if not\r\ngone, was greatly interfered with in every one of the years from 1603 to\r\n1610, excepting perhaps the years 1604 and 1605, which would hardly have\r\ncome within the limit of 30 plague-deaths in a week. In 1604 his name is\r\njoined in a patent with that of Laurence Fletcher for the Globe theatre.\r\nPlays continued to be acted in the plague-years, before the court or in\r\nthe houses of the nobility; but the applause of the pit and gallery would\r\nhave been wanting. _Macbeth_, which is supposed, from its subject, to have\r\nbeen written to celebrate the accession of the king of Scots to the\r\nEnglish crown was not put on the stage until 1610 or 1611. _King Lear_\r\nwas given before the court at Christmas 1606. One of the quartos of\r\n_Troilus and Cressida_, published in 1609, with the author’s name, has a\r\nnote to say that “this new piece had never been staled with the stage,\r\nnever clapper-clawed by the palms of the vulgar;” but another edition of\r\nthe same year (1609) omitting the preface, bears on the title that the\r\npiece had been played at the Globe theatre by the king’s servants, from\r\nwhich it is inferred that it had been acted in the interval between the\r\ntwo editions of 1609. After 1610, and continuously so until 1625, there\r\nwas no plague in London to interfere with the business of actors and\r\nplay-writers, just as the period from 1594 to 1603 was a clear interval.\r\nThe earlier time of freedom was the great period of the drama in London.\r\nThe disastrous plague of 1603 and the successive unhealthy summers and\r\nautumns until 1610 seriously interfered with it, and seriously interfered,\r\nalso, with Shakespeare’s active share in the production of plays on the\r\nstage. Whatever writing he did after that would have been with a less\r\ncertain prospect of representation, or, one may say, was not done under\r\nthe same direct influence of playhouse atmosphere which inspired his\r\nearlier comedies and historical plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in the Provinces in 1603 and following years.\r\n\r\nReturning now to 1603, to follow the infection into towns and villages in\r\nthe provinces, we find first that the plague had been active in some\r\nprovincial parts of England for several months before it broke out\r\nseverely in London in 1603. At Chester the great epidemic, referred to in\r\nthe sequel, began in September, 1602. At Stamford, an epidemic which\r\neventually carried off nearly 600 is heard of first on December 2, 1602,\r\nwhen the corporation resolved to build a “cabbin” for the plague-stricken,\r\nand again in January, 1603, when a fourth part of a fifteenth was levied\r\nfor their relief and maintenance[943].\r\n\r\nAt Oxford, which was one of the towns earliest and most severely smitten,\r\nafter London, the disease was first seen in July, 1603, and was supposed\r\nto have been spread abroad by the “lewd and dissolute behaviour of some\r\nbase and unruly inhabitants.” In September the colleges broke up, having\r\nmade a collection for the relief of the plague-stricken town’s people\r\nbefore leaving. The Michaelmas term was prorogued until December 5, but\r\nvery few came to the congregation, the plague not ceasing until February.\r\nAnthony Wood says:\r\n\r\n    “The truth is, the times were very sad, and nothing but lamentation\r\n    and bemoanings heard in the streets. Those that had wealth retired\r\n    into the country, but those that were needy were, if not taken away by\r\n    death, almost starved, and so consequently ready to mutiny against\r\n    their superiors for relief.” All the gates of colleges and halls were\r\n    constantly kept shut day and night, a few persons being left in them\r\n    to keep possession. The shops of the town were closed, none but the\r\n    attendants on the sick or the collectors for them were to be seen\r\n    stirring abroad, the churches were seldom or never open for divine\r\n    service.\r\n\r\nThe plague having ceased in February most of the scholars came back, and\r\nin April the infection broke out again, but was prevented from spreading.\r\nThe court was at Oxford in 1604, and plague broke out after it left, the\r\ninfected being sent, as before, to the house in Portmead and to the\r\ncabins. Among the deaths was that of the Principal of Hart Hall,\r\napparently in August. It broke out once more in March, 1605, but did not\r\nspread, whether owing to the measures that were taken or to natural causes\r\nmay remain doubtful[944]. From that date Oxford had a twenty years’\r\nimmunity, until 1625. The Cambridge annals are less full, partly, perhaps,\r\nbecause none of the colleges kept a register on the plan of that of Merton\r\nCollege; but it appears from a letter assigned to 1608 that the Visitor of\r\nKing’s College had been unable to come to the college to exercise his\r\nmuch-needed authority, “in regard of the infection[945].”\r\n\r\nThe severity of plague in 1603 among the provincial towns and country\r\nparishes is known accurately for only a few of them. From a considerable\r\nnumber more there is evidence of outbreaks of one degree or another. Thus\r\nat Canterbury, the accounts of the corporation contain entries of sums\r\npaid for watching shut-up houses, for carrying out the dead, and the like,\r\nduring twenty-four weeks in 1603-4[946]. At Exeter, a pest-house had to be\r\nprovided, and the fairs were not kept[947]. Similar indications of plague\r\ncome from Winchester[948], Colchester[949], Ipswich[950], Norwich[951],\r\nBoston[952], and Newcastle[953]. The register of a parish in Derbyshire\r\n(Brimington) contains plague-deaths in the end of 1602[954].\r\n\r\nFor Chester there are full particulars of a great plague. It began in\r\nSeptember, 1602, in a glover’s house in St John’s Lane, where 7 died, and\r\nkept increasing until the weekly deaths reached 60. In 1603 there died of\r\nthe plague 650, and of other diseases 61. In 1604 the plague-deaths were\r\n986, of which 55 were in one week. From October 14, 1604, to March 20,\r\n1605, 812 died, and about 100 more until the 9th January, 1606, when the\r\ninfection ceased for a time. Cabins outside the city were erected for the\r\nplague-stricken. In some houses, especially of sailors, five or six of the\r\nsame family died in the course of two or three weeks[955].\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been in Nantwich and Northwych in one or more of the\r\nyears 1603-1605, a rate for relief of the poor in them having been ordered\r\non June 22, 1605. Plague-deaths occur in the registers of Macclesfield and\r\nCongleton in 1603. At Stockport 51 were buried of plague from October 9,\r\n1605, to August 14, 1606, most of them in the latter year[956]. Straggling\r\nepidemics are also reported from Northamptonshire--31 burials from plague\r\nat Merston Trussell in 1604, and 16 at Eydon in 1605[957].\r\n\r\nOne of the severest epidemics of the period occurred at York in 1604. The\r\nmarkets were closed, the courts adjourned to Ripon and Durham, and the\r\nMinster and Minster-yard closely shut up. The infected were housed in\r\nbooths on Hobmoor and Horsefair. The number of those who died is put down\r\nat 3512[958]. Durham also had a visitation in St Giles’s parish, but a\r\nminor one[959].\r\n\r\nAt Shrewsbury, however, the plague of 1604 was on the same disastrous\r\nscale as at Chester and York, the deaths in the five parishes from June 2,\r\n1604, to April 6, 1605, having been 667. On October 11, 1604, a\r\nproclamation was issued against buying or receiving apparel, bedding,\r\netc., as it was suspected that plague spread greatly in the town by such\r\nmeans[960]. A weekly tax was levied upon the inhabitants of Manchester,\r\nsometime previous to 1606, for the relief of the poor infected, or\r\nsuspected of being infected, with the plague[961]. It was in Nottingham in\r\n1604, and in at least one of the parishes in the county (Holme\r\nPierrepont)[962].\r\n\r\nThere are few parts of England from which evidence of plague does not come\r\nin the years immediately following the great plague in London in 1603. To\r\nthose already mentioned we have to add Cranborne, in Dorset, where 71 died\r\nof plague (in a total of 91) from June to December, 1604, six deaths\r\nhaving occurred in the family first infected and eight in another[963].\r\nThe parish register of Monkleigh in North Devon has the words “cessat\r\npestis” opposite the entry of a burial on March 30, 1605[964]. In 1606\r\nPeterborough was visited, the infection lasting “until the September\r\nfollowing[965].” In 1606 Eton also was “visited,” as appears from payments\r\nmade[966].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the years 1606-1610, as we have seen, the plague in London occurred as\r\na regular product of the summer and autumn seasons. The outbreak in 1608\r\nhas left several traces in the state letters[967]. On September 12, Lord\r\nChancellor Ellesmere writes from Ashridge (Berkhamstead) to the Secretary\r\nof State that he will remain away until he is fully sure of his London\r\nhouse being clear of the infection. On September 20 the City ditch was\r\nbeing cleaned out, and Parliament was put off until February. On November\r\n26 a letter from the court at Newmarket states that the king is angry that\r\nmy Lord Chamberlain has not sent him the bill of sickness. In 1609 there\r\nwere 13 plague-deaths in Enfield parish, and in 1610 some suspicious cases\r\nnear Theobalds.\r\n\r\nIn the provinces there is no record of plague again until 1608: at\r\nChester, in that year, 14 died of it “at the Talbot[968].” In 1609 the\r\ninfection was at work in a number of provincial centres. On June 1 a\r\nletter from Rochester reports it prevalent in Kent, impeding the work of\r\nthe Commissioners for the Aid. On June 15 the Commissioners at Hereford\r\nrequest farther time on account of the plague. On August 22 the king’s\r\ntenants of Long Bennington, near Grantham, are brought to great poverty by\r\nthe plague[969]. These accounts relate to the counties of Hereford,\r\nLincoln and Kent, and with the last may be taken the brief reference to\r\nplague at Sandwich[970]. Other counties affected in 1609, perhaps only at\r\na few spots, are Derbyshire, Norfolk, Northumberland, and Leicestershire.\r\nIn the first, there died at Chesterfield a few persons of the plague from\r\nMarch 18 until May; at Belper, 51 between May 1 and September 30; and at\r\nHolmesfield, the curate on March 12[971]. At Norwich the outbreak of 1609\r\nwas slight compared with other experiences of that city[972]. Its\r\nexistence at Newcastle the same year is known only from the register of St\r\nNicholas parish[973].\r\n\r\nThe plague in Loughborough was one of the severer kind. The first case of\r\nit appears to have been on the 24th August, 1609, in a woman who had given\r\nbirth to a child on the 19th. The last plague entry in the parish register\r\nis on February 19, 1611; so that the epidemic went on for about eighteen\r\nmonths. During that time the whole mortality was 452, of which by far the\r\nmost were plague-burials. Within a mile of Loughborough is a spot of\r\nground, long after known as the Cabbin Lees, whereon many of the\r\ninhabitants “prudently built themselves huts and encamped to avoid the\r\ninfection[974].”\r\n\r\nIn Leicester there was a slight amount of plague in 1607, and it\r\nreappeared in 1608 (payments on account of it in the former year, and an\r\nitem of “30 hurdells used at the visited houses” in the accounts of 1608).\r\nA more severe outbreak occurred in 1610 and 1611, during and after the\r\ngreat plague at Loughborough. The streets lying towards the Castle were\r\nexempt; a pest-house was built in Belgrave Gate; the burials for 1610 were\r\n82 in St Martin’s parish alone (more than half being from plague), and in\r\n1611 the same parish had 128 burials[975].\r\n\r\nIn 1610 the infection was at work in one or more villages of the county of\r\nDurham; 78 deaths “of the pestilence” occur in the register of Lamesley\r\nparish, and the same year was probably one of the numerous plague seasons\r\ndown to 1647 in Whickham parish, where it is said that the people, perhaps\r\nthe plague-stricken, lived in huts upon Whickham Fell[976]. At Chester in\r\n1610 “many died of the plague[977]”; and at Evesham there was a visitation\r\nwhich caused the wealthier inhabitants to leave the town and the\r\nauthorities to effect a much-needed improvement in the cleanliness of the\r\nstreets (swine found at large to be impounded, stones, timber, dunghills\r\nand carrion to be removed from the streets, and the paving in front of\r\neach house to be repaired and cleansed once a week)[978].\r\n\r\nBetween 1610 and 1625, which was an almost absolutely clear interval for\r\nLondon, there are few accounts of plague from the provinces. In 1611,\r\nmoneys were levied for “the visited” at Sherborne[979], and there was a\r\nlocal rate for the same class at Canterbury in 1614-15[980]. Accounts of\r\nthe same kind for Coventry probably belong to the year 1613[981]. Then, as\r\nwe come near the next great plague-period, which began with the new reign\r\nin 1625, we find an entry of 26 plague-deaths at Banbury in 1623,\r\n“recorded in a part of the original register which has not been\r\ntranscribed into the parchment copy[982]:” if the date be correct, Banbury\r\nwas the first town to break the somewhat prolonged truce with the plague,\r\nwhich became broken all over the country in 1625. There appears also to\r\nhave been distress in Grantham from sickness of some kind in 1623; in\r\nSeptember of that year the corporation of Stamford made a collection “in\r\nthis dangerous time of visitation,” and sent £10 of it to Grantham, the\r\nrest to go “to London or some other town as occasion offered.” But the\r\nyears 1623 and 1624 were so much afflicted with fevers that the “dangerous\r\ntime of visitation” may not have meant plague.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe accounts for Ireland are so casual that one suspects there may have\r\nbeen more plague in that country than the records show. Thus, on January\r\n25, 1604, there is a municipal order at Kilkenny, for men to stand at\r\nevery gate to keep out all strangers or suspected persons that might come\r\nfrom any infected place within the kingdom; and on October 24 there is\r\nanother order, from which it appears that the plague was then in the town,\r\nthat it was needful to have the sick persons removed to remote places,\r\nthat no dung should be in the open streets before the doors, and that no\r\nhogs should go or lie in the streets[983]. Towards the end of 1607 and\r\nbeginning of 1608 there was a “most dreadful pestilence” in the city of\r\nCork, which “by degrees ceased of itself[984].”\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in Scotland, 1603-24.\r\n\r\nThe history of the plague in Scotland, which we left in a former chapter\r\nat the year 1603, begins again in that year and goes on at one place or\r\nanother continuously until 1609. From June, 1603, until February, 1604, it\r\ncontinued in the south of Scotland. At Edinburgh, in April, 1604, the\r\nhouse of Mr John Hall was “clengit,” because a servant woman’s death was\r\nsuspected of the plague: which infection certainly spread in May and\r\nbecame so severe in July that people fled the city[985]. A letter of July\r\n18 from Codrus Cottage, relating to gold-mining, and making mention of\r\nCloseburn, says that the plague is amongst the men[986].\r\n\r\nIn 1605, towards the end of July, the infection reappeared at Edinburgh,\r\nLeith, and St Andrews[987]. On October 7, the chancellor of Scotland, Lord\r\nDunfermline, wrote to the earl of Salisbury that the plague was rife in\r\nthe small towns about Edinburgh, probably its old favourite seats along\r\nthe Firth and on the Fife coast[988]. The chancellor himself, as we know\r\nfrom another source, had had a sad experience of it in his own house; his\r\nson and niece had died of the plague, and his daughter “had the boils” but\r\nrecovered[989]. The next year, 1606, was the worst of this plague-period\r\nin Scotland: “It raged so extremely in all the corners of the kingdoms\r\nthat neither burgh nor land in any part was free. The burghs of Ayr and\r\nStirling were almost desolate, and all the judicatures of the land were\r\ndeserted[990].” It is to this epidemic that a curious transaction,\r\ndiscovered by Chambers, seems to belong. Two houses, on the line of the\r\ngreat road from the south towards Aberdeen, situated on opposite sides of\r\nthe Dee, the one being the house of a proprietor and the other of a\r\nminister, were suspected of having received the infection. The gentlemen\r\nof the county met and resolved to send to Dundee for two professional\r\n“clengers” or disinfectors, giving a bond to the borough of Dundee for 500\r\nmerks for the services of its “clengers[991].”\r\n\r\nIn April of the year following, 1607, we hear of the plague in Dundee\r\nitself, despite the experts, as well as in Perth and other places[992]. In\r\nJuly, 1608, many houses in Dundee were infected, and so many magistrates\r\ndead that new appointments were made by the Privy Council[993]. It broke\r\nout again at Perth on August 29, and continued till May, 1609, “wherein\r\ndeit young and auld 500 persons[994].”\r\n\r\nUntil 1624 there is no other Scottish reference to plague except an entry,\r\nNovember 7, 1609, touching the arrival at Leith of a vessel from the\r\nThames, with some of her crew dead of the plague, and the quarantining of\r\nher at Inchkeith[995]. Edinburgh had a small outbreak the year before the\r\nnext great English plague that we come to. On November 23, 1624, the\r\ninfection was discovered to be in several houses, and the session of the\r\nlaw courts was adjourned to January 8[996]; but Scotland appears to have\r\nhad no part in the great infection of English soil which immediately\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalignant Fever preceding the Plague of 1625.\r\n\r\nThe period of immunity from plague both in London and in the provinces,\r\nwhich began about 1611, was at length broken in 1625. The health of\r\nLondon, and of country districts as well, had not been good for two years\r\nbefore, but plague was not the reigning type of disease. Thus, in London,\r\nthe burials rose from 8959 in 1622, to 11,102 in 1623 and to 12,210 in\r\n1624. The letters of the time enable us to see what it was that disturbed\r\nthe public health. On August 21, 1624, Chamberlain writes from London to\r\nDudley Carleton[997]:\r\n\r\n    “We had 328 died this week, a greater number than hath been these\r\n    fifteen or sixteen years, and yet no mention of plague. God keep it\r\n    from among us, for we are in danger. But this spotted fever is\r\n    cousin-german to it at least, and makes as quick riddance almost. The\r\n    Lady Hatton hath two or three of her children sick of it at her\r\n    brother Fanshaw’s, in Essex, and hath lost her younger daughter, that\r\n    was buried at Westminster on Wednesday night by her father; a pretty\r\n    gentlewoman, much lamented.” Again, on September 4: “We have here but\r\n    a sickly season, which is easily seen by the weekly mounting of our\r\n    bill, which is come this last week to 407, and yet we will acknowledge\r\n    no infection [i.e., of plague]. Indeed, by the particulars we find\r\n    about 250 of them to be children, most of the rest carried away by\r\n    this spotted fever, which reigns almost everywhere, in the country as\r\n    ill as here.... The mortality is spread far and near, and takes hold\r\n    of whole households in many places.” On October 9: “The town continues\r\n    sickly still, for this week there died 347.” On October 23 we hear of\r\n    the Lord Keeper being “troubled with the fluent disease of the\r\n    time”--the flux, or flix. On December 18 (as well as previously on\r\n    August 21) a cure of smallpox is mentioned in a person of quality.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the prevalent types of epidemic sickness, in the houses\r\nof the great as well as among the poor--spotted fever or typhus, dysentery\r\nor flux, and smallpox. Two of these continued into the plague-year, 1625,\r\nas Taylor, the Water-poet, says of that occasion:\r\n\r\n  “Thou see’st the fearful plague, the flix and fever,\r\n   Which many a soul doth from the body sever.”\r\n\r\nAn eminent victim of the “pestilent fever” was the marquis of Hamilton,\r\nwho died of it while at Moor Park, Rickmansworth, on Ash-Wednesday,\r\n1625[998]. His residence in London was the house called Fisher’s Folly\r\n(mentioned by Stow) outside Bishopsgate in a parish which was now\r\n“pestered” with tenements of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe fever was not always called the spotted fever. It may have been the\r\nsame disease that is often spoken of under the name of ague--“the ague\r\nwith a hundred names,” as Abraham Holland says (1625). Thus, Mead, of\r\nChrist’s College, Cambridge, writes on September 4, 1625: “Agues grow\r\nwonderfully rife both here and everywhere; so that one told me yesterday\r\nthat about Royston and Barkway they wanted help to gather their harvest\r\nout of the fields”--perhaps the same sort of “burning fever” which we\r\nshall have to trace a few pages later, both in town and country, in time\r\nof peace as well as in the Civil Wars, the type of sickness which became\r\nthe common one in England when the plague had ceased, reaching its highest\r\npoint in the 18th century. But here again we meet the old difficulty of\r\n“influenza.”\r\n\r\nThese historical glimpses of spotted fevers, or pestilent fevers, in the\r\nhouses of the great, as well as among the common people, are in\r\naccordance not only with the London bills of mortality for the respective\r\nyears, but also with the registers of country parishes and market towns as\r\nabstracted by the laborious Dr Short. Repeating the form of table used in\r\na former chapter, which dealt with the epidemic years 1557-8 and 1580-82,\r\nwe find the years 1623-25 distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n_Country Parishes._\r\n\r\n  Year.      No. of      No. of      Baptised    Buried\r\n             registers   unhealthy   in same     in same\r\n             examined    parishes\r\n\r\n  1622          85          11        177          223\r\n  1623          84          30        601          836\r\n  1624          87          19        362          511\r\n  1625          88          13        246          327\r\n\r\n\r\n_Market Towns._\r\n\r\n  Year.

Fever, we may take it,\r\nwas the prevalent epidemic types both in London and provincial places,\r\nurban and rural. In his other treatise Short calls it “malignant spotted\r\nfever,” and refers specially to the parish registers of Keswick, Penrith,\r\nand Wigton for its prevalence in 1623[999].\r\n\r\nChamberlain, in the letter of August 21, 1624, says the spotted fever was\r\ncousin-german at least to the plague; and therein he expressed as a layman\r\nan opinion which was afterwards formally expounded by Willis Sydenham and\r\nMorton. Along with the flux and the smallpox it stood for the\r\nunhealthiness of London in 1623 and 1624 and the first months of 1625,\r\njust as the trio were the chief causes of epidemic mortality in the\r\ncapital in the latter part of the seventeenth century and throughout the\r\nwhole of the eighteenth. But in 1625 London was not yet done with plague.\r\nAs the year passed from spring into summer, the spotted fever did not,\r\nindeed, cease (as we may infer from casual references and from the known\r\nfacts of the analogous plague-years, 1636 and 1665); but it was soon\r\novertaken, surpassed, and eclipsed by the greater infection, the old\r\n“common infection” of the sixteenth century, the bubo-plague itself. To\r\nexplain the existence of typhus in the Liberties and out-parishes of\r\nLondon in 1623 and 1624, we find ready to hand the evidence of\r\novercrowding while the plague was quiet from 1611; the births in 1624 were\r\nabout half as many again as immediately before the last great plague of\r\n1603, and the deaths were twice as many. The fringe of poverty had grown\r\nonce more, despite the epidemic checks of flux, fever and smallpox: the\r\nharvest was ready for the sickle, and the reaping took place in the summer\r\nand autumn of 1625. The infection of plague was lurking in London, as it\r\nhad been for nearly three centuries; but it depended for its activity upon\r\nthe times and seasons, and the season of 1625 was a favourable one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Plague of 1625.\r\n\r\nThe previous summer of 1624 had been unusually hot and dry. The weather in\r\nOctober was exceptionally fine, and the fruit crop was abundant. In\r\nJanuary the weather was warm and mild. On February 25 there occurred one\r\nof those very high tides that come perhaps once in a generation. Thames\r\nStreet was wrecked, Westminster Hall was “full three feet in water all\r\nover. But the greater loss we hear of in the drowning of marshes, and\r\noverthrowing the walls in Kent, Essex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and other\r\nplaces near the sea[1000].” For the first three months of 1625 the deaths\r\nfrom plague were two or three in a week, some weeks being clear. In the\r\nlast week of March they were 11, and in the week after, 10. In the last\r\nweek of May they were 69, reported from twenty parishes. The spring is\r\ndescribed by the Water-poet as “wholesome;” but the early summer was\r\nunusually cold. On June 12 Chamberlain writes: “We have had for a month\r\ntogether the extremest cold weather ever I knew in this season.” The whole\r\nmonth of June was a time of “ceaseless rain in London[1001].” In the\r\ncountry, the hay-harvest was spoilt, and the corn-harvest was only a half\r\ncrop[1002]. Another says (in verse), that the summer sun wore sallow hair\r\nand a languishing complexion; the air was full of black mists and damp,\r\nwith no dewdrops at night, but a vaporous smoke[1003]. The following table\r\nof the weekly burials (with christenings) in London will show how the\r\nplague increased after the rains of June. The mortality of May and June\r\nhad been a good deal higher for the season than in the moderate endemic\r\nyears of plague, such as the last series from 1606 to 1611; but it was not\r\nuntil July that a plague of the first degree declared itself.\r\n\r\n_A Table of the Christenings and Mortality in London for the year\r\n1625._[1004]\r\n\r\n                                               Of        Parishes\r\n  Week ending    Christened     Buried       Plague      Infected\r\n\r\n  Dec.  23           165           183           0           0\r\n        30           176           211           0           0\r\n  Jan.   6           199           220           1           1\r\n        13           194           196           1           1\r\n        20           160           240           0           0\r\n        27           178           226           0           0\r\n  Feb.   3           178           174           3           1\r\n        10           161           204           5           2\r\n        17           181           211           3           1\r\n        24           190           252           1           1\r\n  Mar.   3           185           207           0           0\r\n        10           196           210           0           0\r\n        17           175           262           4           3\r\n        24           187           226           8           2\r\n        31           133           243          11           4\r\n  Apr.   7           184           239          10           4\r\n        14           154           256          24          10\r\n        21           160           230          25          11\r\n        28           134           305          26           9\r\n  May    5           158           292          30          10\r\n        12           140           332          45          13\r\n        19           182           379          71          17\r\n        26           145           401          78          16\r\n  June   2           123           395          69          20\r\n         9           125           434          91          25\r\n        16           110           510         165          31\r\n        23           110           640         239          32\r\n        30           125           942         390          50\r\n  July   7           114          1222         593          57\r\n        14           115          1741        1004          82\r\n        21           137          2850        1819          96\r\n        28           155          3583        2471         103\r\n  Aug.   4           128          4517        3659         114\r\n        11           125          4855        4115         112\r\n        18           134          5205        4463         114\r\n        25           135          4841        4218         114\r\n  Sept.  1           117          3897        3344         117\r\n         8           112          3157        2550         116\r\n        15           100          2148        1674         107\r\n        22            75          1994        1551         111\r\n        29            78          1236         852         103\r\n  Oct.   6            77           838         538          99\r\n        13            85           815         511          91\r\n        20            91           651         331          76\r\n        27            77           375         134          47\r\n  Nov.   3            82           357          89          41\r\n        10            85           319          92          35\r\n        17            88           274          48          22\r\n        24            88           231          27          16\r\n  Dec.   1            93           190          15          12\r\n         8            90           181          15           7\r\n        15            94           168           6           5\r\n                    ----         -----       -----\r\n                    6983         54265       35417\r\n\r\nThe deaths from all causes in May and June were so many more than the\r\nreported plague-deaths could account for that those who watched the bills\r\nof mortality (Mead at Cambridge, Salvetti in London) suspected that plague\r\nwas being concealed. “It is a strange reckoning,” says Mead of the bill\r\nfor the week ending June 30: “Are there some other diseases as bad and\r\nspreading as the plague, or is there untrue dealing in the account[1005]?”\r\nProbably there were both; at the end of the year the deaths from all\r\ncauses were some 20,000 more than the plague accounted for; and at least\r\nhalf of that excess was extra to the ordinary mortality. The spotted fever\r\nand the flux doubtless continued side by side with the plague, having\r\nbeen its forerunners. The parishes most affected were, as in 1603, St\r\nGiles’s, Cripplegate, St Olave’s, Southwark, St Sepulchre’s, without\r\nNewgate, and St Mary’s, Whitechapel, corresponding to the mazes of lanes\r\nand twisting passages, “pestered” with the tenements of the poorer class,\r\nof which only a few examples now remain from 18th century London. The\r\nfollowing are the parishes with greatest mortality, in their order (Bell):\r\n\r\n                                   Total       Plague\r\n                                   deaths      deaths\r\n\r\n  St Giles’s, Cripplegate           3988        2338\r\n  St Olave’s, Southwark             3689        2609\r\n  St Sepulchre’s, Newgate           3425        2420\r\n  St Mary’s, Whitechapel            3305        2272\r\n  St Saviour’s, Southwark           2746        1671\r\n  St Botolph’s, Aldgate             2573        1653\r\n  St Botolph’s, Bishopsgate         2334         714\r\n  St Andrew’s, Holborn              2190        1636\r\n  St Leonard’s, Shoreditch          1995        1407\r\n  St George’s, Southwark            1608         912\r\n  St Bride’s, Fleet St.             1481        1031\r\n  St Martin’s in the Fields         1470         973\r\n  St Giles’s in the Fields          1333         947\r\n  St Clement’s Danes                1284         755\r\n  St James’s, Clerkenwell           1191         903\r\n  St Magdalen’s, Bermondsey         1127         889\r\n  St Katharine’s, Tower              998         744\r\n  St Dunstan’s in the West           860         642\r\n  97 parishes within the walls     14342        9197\r\n\r\nThe original printed bill of the Parish Clerks is extant for the worst\r\nweek but one, August 4th to 11th[1006]. Its mortalities for the week in\r\neach of the 122 parishes are almost exactly in the order of the final\r\nsummation for the year, so that the details throw no light upon the\r\nquestion, in what direction the infection spread, or what parishes felt\r\nits incidence most as the season advanced. The total mortalities for the\r\nweek within the walls, in the Liberties, and in the nine out-parishes\r\n(within the Bills) are respectively 1144, 2717 and 994. The infection is\r\nsaid[1007] to have begun in Whitechapel, as we conclude that it did also\r\nin 1603; but the City had its due share at length, the parishes of St\r\nStephen, Coleman Street (full of tortuous passages), of Allhallows the\r\nGreat, and of Christ Church having the largest mortalities.\r\n\r\nIn the 97 parishes of the City, the 16 parishes of the Liberties, and 9\r\nout-parishes, the deaths at the end of the year were 54,265 from all\r\ncauses, whereof of the plague 35,417. But that was by no means the whole\r\nmortality. A separate account was kept for the parishes of Stepney,\r\nNewington, Lambeth, Islington, and Hackney, and for the Westminster\r\nparishes, in all of which the deaths from December 30, 1624, to December\r\n22, 1625, were from all causes 8,736, whereof of the plague 5,896[1008].\r\nThe grand total of deaths in 1625 was, accordingly, 63,001, whereof of the\r\nplague 41,313.\r\n\r\nThe large parish of Stepney, extending from Shoreditch to Blackwall, was\r\none of the worst plague-districts in London. It is mentioned as such by\r\nDekker in 1603; and in the plague of 1665 it headed the list, with 8,598\r\ndeaths, whereof of the plague 6,583. We have some particulars of it for\r\n1625: in the week July 18 to 24, there died in it 184, whereof of the\r\nplague, 144; and from July 25 to 31, 259, of which 241 were\r\nplague-deaths[1009]; and those figures would have been nearly doubled in\r\nthe weeks of August. Stepney alone would have had about half the deaths in\r\nthe additional bill for the year; the parish register of Lambeth gives 623\r\nburials, of Islington 213, and of Hackney 170[1010], while Westminster\r\nwith St Mary Newington (or Newington Butts, between Lambeth and Southwark)\r\nand Rotherhithe would account for most of the remainder. The parishes\r\nfarthest out, and on higher ground, such as Hackney, Islington and Stoke\r\nNewington had fewer burials than in 1603.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 1625 was a great national event, although historians, as\r\nusual, do no more than mention it. Coinciding exactly with the accession\r\nof Charles I., it stopped all trade in the City for a season and left\r\ngreat confusion and impoverishment behind it; in many provincial towns and\r\nin whole counties the plague of that or the following years made the\r\npeople unable, supposing that they had been willing, to take up the\r\nforced loan, and to furnish ships or the money for them. The history might\r\nhave proceeded just the same without the plague; but historians would\r\ndoubtless admit that all causes, moral and physical, should be taken into\r\nthe account; and it will not be thought beyond the scope of this history\r\nto enter as fully as possible into these events of sickness. First as to\r\nthe sources, other than statistical. Four or more poems were written on\r\nthe plague of 1625--an interminable one by George Wither (with other\r\ntopics brought in) in eight cantos and about thirty thousand lines[1011],\r\na piece by John Taylor, the water-poet and Queen’s bargeman, not wanting\r\nin graphic touches[1012], a short piece by Abraham Holland[1013], the son\r\nof Philemon Holland, doctor of physic, and another short poem by one\r\nBrewer[1014]. Besides the poems, there were sermons, mostly when the\r\nepidemic was over, and various other moral pieces to improve the occasion.\r\nA broadside called _The Red Crosse_ gives a few details of former plagues.\r\nThe letters of Chamberlain to Carleton, those of Mead, at Christ’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge (whose relation Dr Meddus, rector of St Gabriel’s,\r\nFenchurch Street, was in the City during the epidemic), and the diary of\r\nSalvetti, the envoy of the Grand Duke of Tuscany[1015], supply many\r\nparticulars; while the _Calendar of State Papers_ brings together other\r\ninformation both for London and the provinces. I know of no account of the\r\nplague of 1625 from the medical side[1016].\r\n\r\nJames I., prematurely worn out at fifty-seven, died at Theobalds on March\r\n27, from the effects of a tertian ague, for which he preferred to be\r\ntreated by the plasters and possets of an obscure ague-curer from Dunmow,\r\nsetting aside his physicians, who would have succeeded no better. A great\r\nfuneral, for which 14,000 “blacks” were given out, followed on May 7.\r\nMeanwhile the marriage of Charles I. to the princess Henrietta of France\r\nwas being arranged. The king met his bride at Dover on June 13, and\r\nentered London with her on the 18th, passing up the river in a state barge\r\nto Denmark House, amidst an immense concourse of people on the houses and\r\nshipping, and in wherries on the water, with salvoes of artillery and\r\ndemonstrations of welcome to the Catholic princess. On the 13th the Lord\r\nKeeper had written to Conway, Secretary of State, that cases of plague had\r\noccurred in Westminster, and that he could have wished that his majesty\r\nhad determined to come no nearer than Greenwich. The nobility were kept in\r\ntown to await the coming of the new queen, and some of them by the summons\r\nto Parliament. The Houses met on June 18, and were advised in the king’s\r\nspeech to expedite their business on account of the plague. However, those\r\nwho were disposed to refuse supplies until grievances were redressed could\r\nmake use of the plague as well as the king, and it was proposed by Mallory\r\nand Wentworth to adjourn on that plea until Michaelmas. The Houses sat for\r\nthree weeks, until July 11, when they were adjourned to meet at Oxford on\r\nAugust 1. On a day in June Francis, Lord Russell (afterwards earl of\r\nBedford), “being to go to Parliament, had his shoemaker to pull on his\r\nboots, who fell down dead of the plague in his presence,” so that his\r\nlordship avoided the House. In the first week of July, the court removed\r\nto Hampton Court, and thence to Woodstock and to Beaulieu in the New\r\nForest. The Coronation was put off until October, for reasons connected\r\nwith the queen’s religion as well as for the infection, and eventually\r\nuntil February 2, 1626.\r\n\r\nBefore Parliament rose, it obtained the king’s sanction to a solemn fast.\r\n“This,” says the Tuscan, Salvetti, “is a ceremony which is performed in\r\nall the parishes, and consists in staying in church all day singing\r\npsalms, hearing sermons, the one shortly after the other, and making I\r\nknow not how many prayers, imploring God for stoppage of the plague, and\r\nof the ceaseless rain which for a month past has fallen to the detriment\r\nof all kinds of crops.” At that date, July 1, he says that plague is now\r\nspread through all the streets and has reached other parts of the kingdom.\r\nA general exodus took place to the country, of all who had the means to\r\nremove. As in 1603, the magistrates, the ministers, the doctors, and the\r\nrich men seem to have left the city to take care of itself. On August 9,\r\nSalvetti, who had himself escaped to Richmond, writes: “The magistrates in\r\ndesperation have abandoned every care; everyone does what he pleases, and\r\nthe houses of merchants who have left London are broken into and robbed.”\r\nOn September 1, Dr Meddus, rector of St Gabriel’s, Fenchurch Street,\r\nwrote: “The want and misery is the greatest here that ever any man living\r\nknew; no trading at all; the rich all gone; housekeepers and apprentices\r\nof manual trades begging in the streets, and that in such a lamentable\r\nmanner as will make the strongest heart to yearn.” The city an hour after\r\nnoon was the same as at three in the morning in the month of June, no more\r\npeople stirring, no more shops open[1017]. This is re-echoed in verse by\r\nAbraham Holland:\r\n\r\n  “A noon in Fleet Street now can hardly show\r\n   That press which midnight could, not long ago.\r\n   Walk through the woeful streets (whoever dare\r\n   Still venture on the sad infected air)\r\n   So many marked houses you shall meet\r\n   As if the city were one Red-Cross Street.”\r\n\r\nAnd by the Water-poet:\r\n\r\n  “In some whole street, perhaps, a shop or twain\r\n   Stands open for small takings and less gain.\r\n   And every closed window, door and stall\r\n   Makes every day seem a solemn festival.\r\n   All trades are dead, or almost out of breath,\r\n   But such as live by sickness and by death.”\r\n\r\nThe circumstances are so exactly the same as in 1603 that it is needless\r\nto repeat much: the sextons, coffin-makers, bearers, searchers,\r\napothecaries and quacks are all profitably employed;\r\n\r\n  “And last to dog-killers great gain abounds,\r\n   For braining brawling curs and foisting hounds.”\r\n\r\nThe clocks striking the hours are not heard for the constant tolling of\r\nbells. “Strange,” says Holland,\r\n\r\n  “Strange that the hours should fail to tell the day\r\n   When Time to thousands ran so fast away.”\r\n\r\nOf the sick, Taylor says there were\r\n\r\n  “Some franticke raving, some with anguish crying.”\r\n\r\n--delirious ravings and cries of pain (from the buboes) which we know from\r\nthe accounts for 1665 to have been no rhetorical exaggeration. There were\r\nthe same crowded common graves as in 1603, probably in the same\r\ngraveyards:\r\n\r\n  “My multitude of graves that gaping wide\r\n   Are hourly fed with carcases of men.\r\n   Those hardly swallowed, they be fed again.”\r\n\r\nOr as Taylor says,\r\n\r\n  “Dead coarses carried and recarried still\r\n   Whilst fifty corpses scarce one grave doth fill.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment seems to have been mostly in the hands of quacks. Taylor\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “On many a post I see Quacksalvers’ bills\r\n   Like fencers’ challenges to show their skill.”\r\n\r\nThe Water-poet, being Queen’s bargeman, appears to have had a proper\r\nfeeling for all constituted authorities. After denouncing the quacks, as\r\nmen who “pick their living out of others’ dying,” he proceeds to eulogise\r\nthe regular practitioners, forgetting to add that they were now\r\nconspicuous by their absence:\r\n\r\n  “This sharp invective no way seems to touch\r\n   The learned physicians whom I honour much.\r\n   The Paracelsists and the Galenists,\r\n   The philosophical grave Herbalists,--\r\n   These I admire and reverence, for in those\r\n   God doth dame nature’s secrets fast inclose,\r\n   Which they distribute as occasions serve.”\r\n\r\n--the prevalence of plague not being one of the occasions for revealing\r\nthe secrets entrusted to them.\r\n\r\nThe medical faculty is hardly at all in evidence the whole time. Thayre’s\r\nsurgical treatise of 1603 was reprinted; while a semi-empiric, one Stephen\r\nBradwell, the grandson of Banister, a well-known Elizabethan practitioner,\r\npublished a poor essay on plague, patched up from the usual stale sources\r\nand plagiarised even from the lay dialogue of the rector of St Olave’s in\r\n1603[1018]. Bradwell addressed the reader, on July 15 “from my study in\r\nMugwell-street, ready to my power to do thee any pleasure.”\r\n\r\n    “I have two powders. I have also an excellent electuary. I have\r\n    likewise lozenges, and rich pomanders to smell of. These are all of my\r\n    grandfather’s invention, and have been proved to be admirably\r\n    effectual both by his and my father’s experience. I confess they are\r\n    costly; but slight means and cheap medicines (however they promise)\r\n    prove as dear as death. The first powder is 12 pence a dram. The\r\n    second is 3 pence a grain (the quantity is 10 or 12 grains). The\r\n    electuary is 2 shillings and 6 pence an ounce, the quantity is one or\r\n    two drams. There is a fellow in Distaff-lane that disperseth his bills\r\n    abroad, bragging of a medicine that was my grandfather Bannister’s. My\r\n    grandfather was very scrupulous of giving any special receipts to\r\n    others. But if any man can say he hath any receipt of his, I am sure,\r\n    if it were of any value, I have the copy of it. Because many men know\r\n    that I have a whole volume of excellent receipts left me both by my\r\n    grandfather and my father, and lest they should conceive me as too\r\n    strict and covetous in keeping all secret to myself, I have thought\r\n    fit for the common good to divulge this excellent antidote\r\n    following:”--the ingredients occupying a whole page.\r\n\r\nThis enterprising tradesman had been at Oxford, where he failed to take a\r\ndegree in medicine, but he was a licentiate of the College of Physicians.\r\nHe is the single literary representative of the faculty, so far as\r\nappears, in 1625; and there is nothing in his essay that concerns us,\r\nexcept the following corroboration of a well-known character of the\r\nepidemic:\r\n\r\n    “Poor people, by reason of their great want, living sluttishly,\r\n    feeding nastily on offals, or the worst and unwholesomest meats, and\r\n    many times, too, lacking food altogether, have both their bodies much\r\n    corrupted, and their spirits exceedingly weakened; whereby they\r\n    become (of all others) most subject to this sickness. And therefore we\r\n    see the plague sweeps up such people in greatest heaps.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to know whether any considerable proportion recovered. It\r\nappears that, as in 1603, the buboes and boils might come out in the same\r\nperson more than once, and that the best chance was from their\r\nsuppuration:\r\n\r\n  “Some with their carbuncles and sores new burst\r\n   Are fed with hope they have escaped the worst.”\r\n\r\nBut the best hope was in flight, as Bradwell was candid enough to say,\r\nalthough he remained behind with his shilling powders and half-crown\r\nelectuaries. _Cito cede, longé recede, tardé redi_--is the proverbial\r\nadvice which he quotes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the people in their flight, unless they were nobles or squires\r\nwith country houses, fared but ill in the provinces. The story of their\r\nreception in country towns and villages is so like that of 1603 that one\r\nmight suppose in this, as in other things, that the writers of 1625 were\r\ncopying from Dekker. One of the versifiers, Brewer, has a section\r\nspecially devoted to a “Relation of the many miseries that many of those\r\nthat fly the City do fall into in the country.” They are driven back by\r\nmen with bills and halberds, passing through village after village in\r\ndisgrace until they end their journey; they sleep in stables, barns and\r\nouthouses, or even by the roadside in ditches and in the open fields. And\r\nthat was the lot of comparatively wealthy men. Taylor says that when he\r\nwas with the queen’s barge at Hampton Court and up the river almost to\r\nOxford, he had much grief and remorse to see and hear of the miserable and\r\ncold entertainment of many Londoners:\r\n\r\n  “The name of London now both far and near\r\n   Strikes all the towns and villages with fear.\r\n   And to be thought a Londoner is worse\r\n   Than one that breaks a house, or takes a purse ...\r\n   Whilst hay-cock lodging with hard slender fare,\r\n   Welcome, like dogs into a church, they are.\r\n   For why the hob-nailed boors, inhuman blocks,\r\n   Uncharitable hounds, hearts hard as rocks,\r\n   Did suffer people in the field to sink\r\n   Rather than give or sell a draught of drink.\r\n   Milkmaids and farmers’ wives are grown so nice\r\n   They think a Citizen a cockatrice,\r\n   And country dames are waxed so coy and brisk\r\n   They shun him as they shun a basilisk.”\r\n\r\nTaylor gives various instances in prose:\r\n\r\n    “A man sick of an ague lying on the ground at Maidenhead in Berkshire,\r\n    with his fit violently on him, had stones cast at him by two men of\r\n    the towne (whom I could name), and when they could not cause him to\r\n    rise, one of them tooke a hitcher, or long boat-hook, and hitched in\r\n    the sick man’s breeches, drawing him backward with his face grovelling\r\n    on the ground, drawing him so under the bridge in a dry place, where\r\n    he lay till his fit was gone, and having lost a new hat, went his\r\n    way.”\r\n\r\nOne at Richmond was drawn naked in the night by his own wife and boy, and\r\ncast into the Thames, where the next day the corpse was found. The village\r\nof Hendon distinguished itself by relieving the sick, burying the dead,\r\nand collecting eight pounds, at the least (being but a small village) for\r\nthe poor of St Andrew’s, Holborn, besides allowing good weekly wages to\r\ntwo men to attend and bury such as died. The village of Tottenham appears\r\nto have been equally hospitable; but as it was on the road to Theobalds,\r\nand some of his majesty’s servants dwelt there, the Privy Council on July\r\n19, wrote to the justices of Middlesex to order the inhabitants of\r\nTottenham, who had received into their houses “multitudes of inmates,” to\r\nremove the new-comers and not to receive any in future[1019]. Although the\r\nking was not at Richmond, yet as there was a royal residence there, the\r\ninhabitants sought to drive away citizens on the ground of the warrant\r\nforbidding them to approach any of his majesty’s houses[1020]. At\r\nWoodstock, where the Court was in August, no one was allowed to go from\r\nthence to London, nor any to come thither, and for contraveners a gibbet\r\nwas set up at the Court gate[1021]. It was hardly possible to get a letter\r\nsmuggled into London[1022]; in the provinces “no one comes into a town\r\nwithout a ticket, yet there are few free places.” At Southampton on August\r\n27, a stranger died in the fields: “He came from London. He had good store\r\nof money about him, which was taken before he was cold[1023].” Dr Donne,\r\nthe dean of St Paul’s, confirms these experiences in a letter of November\r\n25, from Chelsea[1024]:\r\n\r\n    “The citizens fled away as out of a house on fire, and stuffed their\r\n    pockets with their best ware, and threw themselves into the highways,\r\n    and were not received so much as into barns, and perished so: some of\r\n    them with more money about them than would have bought the village\r\n    where they died. A justice of the peace told me of one that died so\r\n    with £1400 about him.”\r\n\r\nMeddus, rector of St Gabriel’s, heard of one sad case of a citizen in\r\nLeadenhall-street who removed to the country with his seven children, “but\r\nhaving buried all there is come again hither,” in July[1025]. In October,\r\nthe people began to come back, although the infection was by no means\r\nover; Salvetti, who was himself near Huntingdon, says that many of the\r\nreturning artisans caught the infection in the city, which is probable\r\nenough, as it happened also in 1665. On October 15, a correspondent of\r\nMead’s wrote that in his passing through London he found the streets full\r\nof people, and the highways full of passengers, horse and foot. On October\r\n24, we hear of great distress among tradesmen, artificers and farmers\r\nround London, and of discontent at the forced loan[1026]; although the\r\nCourt itself was in as great extremity during the plague for want of money\r\nas any private house could have been. On November 22, the lord mayor and\r\naldermen wrote to the Privy Council that the great mortality, although it\r\nhad taken many poor people away, yet had made more poverty by decay of\r\ntradesmen, the want and misery being still very great[1027]. Still, the\r\neffect of this great plague on London, cutting off some fifty thousand in\r\na year, or more than a fifth part of the population, must have been, like\r\nthat of all other great plagues in London, to cut off the fringe of\r\npoverty and broken fortunes, and to raise the general average of\r\nwell-being of those that remained. Trade would come back; but the\r\nsubmerged tenth, or sixth, or fourth, or whatever fraction they made, were\r\ndrowned for good.\r\n\r\nLondon soon filled up the gaps made by the plague, doubtless by fresh\r\nblood from the country. In 1627, the christenings were again at 8,408,\r\nhaving been at a maximum of 8,299 the year before the plague. In 1629 they\r\nactually exceeded the burials by more than a thousand (9,901 to 8,771),\r\nand continued to be slightly in excess until the next plague of 1636.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plague of 1625 near London.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the capital the parishes on the Kentish\r\nchalk below London, such as Deptford, Greenwich, Lewisham, Eltham and\r\nBromley had more plague in 1625 than in 1603. Kensington, for some unknown\r\nreason, has 80 deaths from all causes in the register, as against 32 in\r\n1603 and 62 (of plague 25) in 1665. The group of parishes in Middlesex,\r\nsuch as Enfield, Edmonton and Finchley, had each a large number of deaths,\r\nbut somewhat less than in 1603 and 1665, and the same holds for Hackney\r\nand Stoke Newington, Islington and Hampstead. Places up the Thames all the\r\nway from Battersea to Windsor were infected, including Wandsworth, Putney,\r\nIsleworth, Richmond, Kingston and Hampton Court. Eton was “visited;” even\r\nthe sequestered village of Stoke Pogis had houses shut up “by reason of\r\nthe contagion” and a collection made for their impoverished inmates. Among\r\nthe Hertfordshire towns to which Londoners resorted in plague-times,\r\nWatford is known to have had plague-deaths in 1625. In Essex,--Stratford,\r\nTottenham, Romford and Barking had each a large number of plague-deaths,\r\nand, in Surrey, Croydon and Streatham. At Carshalton, oddly enough, the\r\nheavy mortality was the year after (1626) “not from plague, but from a\r\ndisease somewhat akin to it[1028].”\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in the Provinces in 1625 and following years.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Salvetti and other gossips of the time that the infection\r\nof plague in 1625 was carried all over the country from London by the\r\nfleeing citizens, and that few places remained free from it, just as it\r\nwas said afterwards for the plague of 1665. So far as records show, one\r\nwould not be warranted in inferring a great provincial prevalence of\r\nplague either in 1625 or in 1665. There was plague at Plymouth, and in the\r\nsouth-western counties, under very special circumstances, as we shall see.\r\nThere was plague also at Norwich, said to have been brought from Yarmouth,\r\nand at Colchester the year after. Newcastle, also, which hardly ever\r\nescaped the infection when it was afoot, had one of its minor visitations.\r\nBut, on the whole, it is impossible to show by local evidences that the\r\nplague of 1625 was diffused universally over England, either in that or in\r\nthe following year, or that it grew to a great epidemic in but a few\r\nprovincial centres[1029]. Probably all the plague-deaths in the provinces\r\ntogether, in 1625 and 1626, would not have made a fifth part of the\r\nmortality in London.\r\n\r\nThe interest centres in the plague at Plymouth, with which the outbreaks\r\nat Ashburton, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bridport, and perhaps Portsmouth, Rye and\r\nother places, may be connected, if not causally, yet in neighbourhood. The\r\nfirst that we hear of sickness at Plymouth is under date July 26, 1625;\r\nsome of the ships arrived there had been visited with sickness, and the\r\nsick had been landed and lodged under sails[1030]. It is not called “the\r\nsickness,” and it is not clear that it was bubo-plague. There may, indeed,\r\nhave been real plague on board ships of war: Stow says that it was in the\r\nfleet in 1603, and there is evidence of its existence now and again in the\r\nVenetian galleys of an earlier day. But we are now come to the period of\r\nthe beginnings of ship-fever, as we shall see in the next chapter; and,\r\nfor the present, we must not assume that the sickness on board ship in\r\n1625 was all plague, or chiefly plague.\r\n\r\nThe ships at Plymouth in July were doubtless a part of the squadron of\r\nninety sail, which sailed thence in autumn, carrying ten thousand men to\r\nmake war on Spain, in accordance with the anti-Catholic policy which had\r\nbeen forced upon James I. in the last years of his reign, and was now\r\nbeing carried out by Charles I. and Buckingham. This was not the first\r\nfruit of that policy. The immediate result of it was Mansfeld’s English\r\ntroops for the recovery of the Palatinate to Protestant rule. That\r\nexpedition failing to effect a landing was speedily broken with disease,\r\nand before it had been many days on shore in Holland was burying 40 or 50\r\nmen a day. The fleet eight months later had a similar experience. The\r\nships were victualled with rotten food, and the men were supplied with\r\nworthless clothing. As the facts were never investigated, the king having\r\ninterfered to shield the duke of Buckingham from the attack on him by Sir\r\nJohn Eliot, peculation and jobbery were never proved, although it was\r\nknown to everyone that honesty was the last quality to be looked for in\r\nthose about the king and the favourite. The fleet reached the Bay of Cadiz\r\nand made a futile demonstration there. It is in the month of November that\r\nwe begin to hear of sickness. On the 9th Viscount Wimbledon writes from on\r\nboard the ‘Anne Royal’ to Secretary Conway that there are not men enough\r\nto keep the watches owing to sickness. On December 22, the Commissioners\r\nat Plymouth write to the Council that about thirty sail had arrived there\r\nwith 4,000 soldiers “in such miserable condition as for the most part to\r\nbe incapable of such comforts as the country would afford them.” Captain\r\nBolles, who died since their coming in, declared the occasion of his\r\nsickness to be scarcity and corruption of the provisions. Great numbers of\r\nthe soldiers are continually thrown overboard. Yesterday seven fell down\r\nin the streets. The rest are weak, and want clothes, for the supply of\r\nwhich some thousands of pounds were needed. The despatch of December 29,\r\nsays, “They stink as they go, and the poor rags they have are rotten and\r\nready to fall off if they be touched”[1031].\r\n\r\nSo far there is no word of plague; on the other hand there is a strong\r\nprobability that the sickness was ship-fever, or typhus. It is not until\r\nthe spring of 1626 that the plague is mentioned at Plymouth. On March 18,\r\nsickness increases at Plymouth and the plague is wondrous rife. On March\r\n28, the plague is dispersed about the town. On April 5, the sickness\r\nincreases very much. On the 11th, 40 died last week and twenty houses are\r\nshut up; some of the sick died and were buried in less than twenty-four\r\nhours. On 8th June, the plague is very bad in Plymouth, and the town is\r\ndestitute of its best inhabitants. The town-council records bear witness\r\nto a rate having been levied for the relief of the plague-stricken, and to\r\nattempts as late as 1628 to collect their share of it from those who had\r\nfled the town in 1626. The deaths at Plymouth are stated in a manuscript\r\nbook of the municipal annals to have been 2,000[1032].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile plague appeared in other parts of Devonshire. In Exeter it had\r\nbeen prevalent sooner than in Plymouth itself; a letter of November 17,\r\n1625, speaks of the afflicted state of the city, and of the weekly\r\ncontributions for the plague-stricken. Some particulars of the state of\r\nExeter at this time are given in a memorial to the Privy Council by the\r\nmayor and bailiffs of the city, dated October 15, 1627. During the great\r\nsickness which fell on their city, and was not cleared in sixteen months,\r\nall trading was stopped and the inhabitants generally left the town. To\r\nappease a mutiny of the more disordered people, who threatened to burn the\r\ncity, a rate was assessed generally on the city, but most of the\r\ninhabitants being absent, the corporation took up the amount at interest\r\non their own credit. The persons whose names are inclosed, being\r\ninhabitants who have returned to the city, now refuse to pay the rate\r\nassessed in their absence; and the Council is petitioned to summon them\r\nbefore it[1033].\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1626, the plague is reported to be rife “in Devonshire,” and\r\nspecifically, on July 28, at Okehampton and Ashburton. The epidemic at\r\nAshburton was on the same severe scale as at Plymouth. It began in the end\r\nof 1625, but was most fatal in April and May, 1626. The deaths in a\r\ntwelvemonth were 365, “probably a fourth of the inhabitants[1034].” (In\r\n1627 there were only 27 deaths, doubtless from the empty state of the\r\ntown.) The same summer it is heard of in Dorsetshire. On September 2, the\r\ndeputy lieutenants and justices of the county petition the Privy Council\r\nthat the 1000 soldiers who were to be removed from Devon and Cornwall,\r\nshould not be quartered in Dorset, but in Somerset, as the former was\r\nvisited with the plague[1035]. Perhaps Bridport was the centre of plague\r\nreferred to. Sometime later in the year, perhaps in November, the bailiffs\r\nand burgesses of that town explain to the Council that, although they had\r\nsubscribed to the loan, yet they were unable to pay the amount subscribed\r\nas the town was destitute by reason of a twenty weeks’ visitation of\r\nplague[1036].\r\n\r\nThe last of this series of outbreaks in the south-west appears to have\r\nbeen at Dartmouth in the summer of 1627. On June 29, it was reported that\r\nthe plague was so hot there that the inhabitants had left. The mayor wrote\r\non July 19 to the Privy Council that it was true the inhabitants were\r\nstill away, but the plague had ceased; only 15 houses had been infected,\r\nthe inhabitants of which had all been removed to the pest-houses remote\r\nfrom the town[1037].\r\n\r\nFarther east on the Channel coast, Portsmouth had a visitation of plague\r\nprevious to September 28, 1625, perhaps in connexion with the Cadiz fleet;\r\nthe mayor and bailiffs, being at the end of their year’s office, had\r\nrefused to take steps to sever the infected[1038]. At Southampton, only\r\none house was infected on August 27. The infection is reported also from\r\nRye in 1625, and from Canterbury, where the famous composer, Orlando\r\nGibbons, died in the beginning of June, 1625, “not without suspicion of\r\nthe sickness,” says Chamberlain, but, according to Anthony Wood, of the\r\nsmallpox. The king and queen lodged at Canterbury on June 14; but on July\r\n23 the place had to be avoided “for the great infection.”\r\n\r\nFrom Oxford, where the Parliament met on August 1, the vice-chancellor\r\nwrote on July 27, that Sir John Hussey came thither infected from London,\r\nand died, that Dr Chaloner, being in the same house, was since dead, that\r\nthe infection was in other parts of Oxford, and that All Souls College was\r\nshut up. There was a slight revival of it in January, 1626, which caused\r\nthe exercises and the sermons at St Mary’s to be put off[1039]. Anthony\r\nWood gives much the same account as for 1603, and blames the great\r\nincrease of “cottages” erected by townsmen, to which scholars were\r\nenticed.\r\n\r\nCambridge kept free in 1625; but on October 3, three deaths are reported\r\nat Trumpington--one Peck, his wife, and maid. On the same date three\r\nhouses were shut up at Royston, and the infected “translated into the\r\nfields[1040].”\r\n\r\nThe outbreak at Norwich was one of the severer degree[1041]. It was said\r\nto have been brought in the end of June, 1625, from Yarmouth, where\r\nnothing is recorded of it. A king’s order to the mayor imposed extensive\r\ncleansings, &c., but the plague increased from 26 deaths in a week in\r\nJuly, to 40 in September, reaching a maximum of 73 from plague in a week,\r\nbesides 18 from other causes. On August 27, Mead, the Cambridge don,\r\nwrites that he had met the Norwich carrier, who told him that the number\r\nof burials there the last week was 77, whereof of the plague 67, and but\r\n14 the week before. The infection lingered on until December of the year\r\nafter (1626), the total deaths from plague having been 1431. The plague at\r\nNorwich was made the excuse, by the mayor and aldermen writing to the\r\nPrivy Council on January 30, 1627, for not contributing towards shipping\r\nfor the king’s service; the city was distressed from inundations and the\r\nplague, “many hundreds of houses” standing empty. There appears to have\r\nbeen some plague at Lynn in the end of 1625, a Privy Council order of\r\nJanuary, 1626, authorising the fair to be held there, the disease having\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1627, the bailiffs and aldermen of Colchester offer the same\r\nexcuse as Norwich; they are unable to set forth any ships as directed on\r\naccount of the heavy visitation of their town by the plague, the decay of\r\ntheir trade in the new draperies and baize, and the loss of their ships at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nLeicestershire, also, would appear to have had another visitation in 1626.\r\nOn July 28, the muster in that county was respited on account of the shire\r\ntown and nine or ten other towns being visited with the plague. Of that\r\nthere is no trace in the excellent county history by Nichols. Leicester,\r\nlike Bristol and other places, is known to have imposed quarantine against\r\nLondoners in the summer of 1625. It is probable that plague was also in\r\nWarwickshire in 1626[1042].\r\n\r\nAmong other outbreaks in 1625 was one at Newcastle, but it does not\r\ncompare in extent with some earlier and later plagues there. On September\r\n10, Lord Clifford writes from Appleby Castle to Secretary Conway that\r\nNewcastle is so infected with plague, so ill fortified, and ill\r\nneighboured, that 500 men would disarm it. In his own county of Cumberland\r\nthere was plague in Lord William Howard’s house. Sir Francis Howard’s lady\r\ntook the infection from a new gown she had from London, so as she died the\r\nsame day she took it; they are all dispersed most miserably, with the\r\ngreatest terror in the world. Cheshire also had the infection in\r\n1625[1043].\r\n\r\nAfter a clear interval of two or three years, the history of plague begins\r\nagain in London, and in the provinces. The London plague of 1630 was a\r\nsmall affair (1317 deaths), the city being otherwise so healthy that the\r\nchristenings exceeded the total burials (9315 to 9237). In 1630, at the\r\nsame time as the small London outbreak, Cambridge had what appears to have\r\nbeen its most considerable plague, but a very small one at the worst. It\r\nbegan about February 28, caused the colleges to break up and the midsummer\r\nassizes to be transferred to Royston, and from first to last produced 214\r\ndeaths, known or suspected from plague[1044].\r\n\r\nAlong with it there were a good many cases at Wymondham (Windham), and\r\nsome straggling cases at Norwich and Colchester, continuing into 1631,\r\nsome 20 or 30 dying at Norwich of plague in the latter year[1045]. The\r\nother centre in 1630 was in the north-west. Shrewsbury, an old-world town\r\nwhich seldom escaped, had a localised epidemic in St Chad’s parish. It\r\nbegan on May 24 in Frankwell, but was confined to that street by cutting\r\noff the residents therein from the rest of the town, and by removing the\r\ninfected to pest-houses in Kingsland[1046]. It continued at Shrewsbury\r\ninto 1631, and is heard of also at Preston, Wrexham, and Manchester,\r\ncollections having been made in neighbouring places for the\r\ninfected[1047]. But the one great outbreak of those years fell upon the\r\ntown of Louth, in Lincolnshire, of which the sole particulars are that the\r\nplague from April to the end of November, 1631, swept away 754 persons of\r\nwhom nearly 500 in July and August[1048].\r\n\r\nAfter four years clear in London and in all parts of England (years\r\noccupied with the growing quarrel between the king and the Parliament),\r\nplague broke out again not far from Louth, where we saw it last, namely at\r\nHull. A century and a half had passed since Hull’s last great devastation\r\nby plague year after year from 1472 to 1478. It was then a medieval town,\r\nwith a chain drawn across the mouth of its creek of the Humber, surrounded\r\nby great abbeys, and owing its importance to its trade in stock fish from\r\nIceland and the North Sea. In the Tudor times it had experienced one small\r\nepidemic about the Blackfriars Gate in 1576, causing about a hundred\r\ndeaths. The date of the outbreak in 1635 is not given exactly; but, as in\r\nthe 15th century, it was the peculiarity of Hull among provincial towns\r\nthat it kept the infection for several years,--down to June, 1638.\r\nBusiness was paralysed, schools shut up, and the town deserted by the\r\nwealthier classes. The deaths from plague from first to last are counted\r\nat 2730, besides those which occurred in flight to other places. Upwards\r\nof 2,500 persons, once in easy circumstances, are said to have been\r\nreduced to seek relief, to which the county of York contributed[1049]. In\r\n1643 Hull stood a siege, but there is no farther mention of plague; nor\r\ndid the town suffer in 1665.\r\n\r\nThe year 1635, which saw the beginning of the Hull plague, at a time when\r\nthe infection was absolutely quiet in the capital, saw also the beginning\r\nof an outbreak at Sandwich, with accompanying cases at Canterbury, and a\r\nbeginning at Yarmouth, Lynn and Norwich[1050], in all which places the\r\ninfections lingered at a low endemic level for a year or more. The dates\r\nare important only as showing that these provincial infections were\r\nlooking up some months before the sharp outburst in London in the late\r\nautumn of 1636 made any sign. In Sandwich, on the 12th of March, 1637,\r\nthere were 78 houses “visited,” and 188 persons infected; on June 30, 24\r\nhouses shut up, with 103 persons, some of them lodged in tents; from July\r\n6 to October 5, there were buried of the plague about ten every week in St\r\nClement’s parish. Considerable expenses were incurred (more than £40 a\r\nweek), to which the county of Kent and the other Cinque Ports\r\ncontributed[1051].\r\n\r\nBesides these lingering endemics in Kent and Norfolk, the great plague\r\nepidemics of 1636 were in Newcastle and London. The Newcastle epidemic\r\nwas both earlier and relatively far more severe than that of the capital.\r\nFor a town of some 20,000 inhabitants, the following weekly figures[1052]\r\nindicate a plague of the first degree, comparable to the London\r\ndeath-rates of 1625 and 1665:\r\n\r\nDied of plague at Newcastle, within the liberties, from May 7 to December\r\n31, 1636:\r\n\r\n           Week       Plague\r\n          ending      deaths\r\n\r\n           May 14       59\r\n               21       55\r\n               28       99\r\n          June  4      122\r\n               11       99\r\n               18      162\r\n               25      133\r\n          July  2      172\r\n                9      184\r\n               16      212\r\n               23      270\r\n               30      366\r\n          Aug.  7      337\r\n               14      422\r\n               21      346\r\n               28      246\r\n         Sept.  4      520\r\n               11      325\r\n   To end of Dec.      908\r\n                      ----\r\n  Total to 31st Dec.  5027\r\n\r\nBesides in Garthside, from May 30 to October 17, 515, making a total of\r\n5542.\r\n\r\nThis tremendous visitation of Tyneside is said to have begun in October,\r\n1635, at North Shields, where the infection rested during the winter cold,\r\nto begin again at Newcastle in spring. During the height of the epidemic\r\nin summer and autumn all trade was suspended, no one being about in the\r\nstreets or in the neighbouring highways. The means tried to check the\r\ninfection were fumigations with pitch, rosin, and frankincense. Newcastle\r\nhad one other visit from the plague, as we shall see, in 1644 and 1645,\r\nduring and after the siege by the Scots Presbyterian army; but in 1665 it\r\nis said to have escaped, although Defoe says that the infection was\r\nintroduced by colliers returning from the Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Plague of 1636.\r\n\r\nThe London plague of 1636 was one of the second degree, for the capital,\r\nand was otherwise peculiar as being rather later in the autumnal season\r\nthan usual.

Stepney\r\nis still wanting from the general bill; but after 1636 it was included\r\ntherein, along with Newington, Lambeth, Westminster, Islington and\r\nHackney. These omitted parishes doubtless contributed largely, Stepney in\r\nparticular, so that the total of plague-deaths would have to be increased\r\nby perhaps two thousand. The following parishes had the severest\r\nmortalities:\r\n\r\n                               Total     Plague-deaths\r\n                               deaths\r\n\r\n  St Giles’s, Cripplegate       2374         870\r\n  St Mary’s, Whitechapel        1766        1060\r\n  St Olave’s, Southwark         1537         847\r\n  St Botolph’s, Aldgate         1506         735\r\n  St Sepulchre’s, Newgate       1327         566\r\n  St Saviour’s, Southwark       1269         742\r\n  St Botolph’s, Bishopsgate     1239         515\r\n  St George’s, Southwark        1044         514\r\n  St Andrew’s, Holborn           922         419\r\n  St Giles’s in the Fields       863         428\r\n\r\nLike the greater plagues of 1603 and 1625, that of 1636 appears to have\r\nbegun in the suburbs[1053]. Taylor, the Water-poet, in reprinting his poem\r\non the plague of 1625, with some notes for 1636, says that of 1076\r\nplague-deaths from April 7 to July 28 (the summation in the annual bill\r\ncomes to 864), only 40 had occurred within the walls, so that the general\r\ninfection of the City must have followed that of the Liberties and\r\nout-parishes. As early in the epidemic as 31 May, according to a record of\r\nthe Middlesex Sessions, “the plague increases most at Stepney,” wherefore\r\nthe Greengoose Fair at Stratford was prohibited, (the parish of Stepney\r\nextending as far as Shoreditch)[1054]. From Taylor we learn that Gravesend\r\nand Faversham had calamitous visitations, and that the infection was in\r\nmany other towns and villages.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1636 was like the plague of 1625 in having been preceded\r\nby much typhus fever in London, and accompanied by the same, as many as\r\n2360 deaths being put down to fever in the plague-year in the classified\r\ncauses of death now issued regularly (since 1629) in their printed bills\r\nby the Parish Clerks’ Hall. The letters and state papers of the time bear\r\nwitness to the usual exodus from the City, the movements of the Court, and\r\npersonal incidents, which have no farther interest after the samples given\r\nfor 1625. One incident relating to the worst week of the plague in London\r\nin 1636 is preserved: eleven persons were committed to Newgate on 5\r\nOctober for going with one Samuel Underhill, a trumpeter, who died of the\r\nplague, to his grave with trumpets and swords drawn in the night time in\r\nShoreditch[1055]. The profession still makes no appearance in the way of\r\nepidemiological writing; but some “necessary directions” were drawn up by\r\nthe College of Physicians, in substance the same as certain statutes\r\nissued on the alarm of plague in 1630[1056].\r\n\r\nNext year, 1637, the plague continued in London, causing 3082 deaths out\r\nof a total of 11,763 in the bills. In 1638 there were only 363\r\nplague-deaths, but the total mortality was 13,624, or nearly 2000 more\r\nthan in the previous year, when plague alone had claimed its 3000. What\r\nwere the epidemic types of disease that caused the high mortality in 1638?\r\n\r\n\r\nFever in London.\r\n\r\nThere ought to have been no difficulty in answering the question. The\r\ncauses of death in the metropolis had been assigned in the books kept at\r\nParish Clerks’ Hall since 1604, and had been printed since 1629. The\r\nprinted series was in the hands of Graunt, from 1629 down to the date of\r\nhis writing, January 1662; and he did abstract the deaths under each head\r\nof disease and casualty from 1629 to 1636 inclusive, and again from 1647\r\nto 1661; but the ten years from 1637 to 1646 inclusive, he omitted as\r\npresenting nothing of importance and as being “inconsistent with the\r\ncapacity” of his sheet of paper[1057]. All the original documents prior to\r\n1658 appear to have been lost in the fire of 1666, so that Graunt’s\r\nomission cannot now be made good. One could wish that the worthy citizen\r\nhad made no difficulty about the size of his paper. The omitted years are\r\nnot only those of great political revolution, which may have had an effect\r\nupon the public health, but they are of special interest for the beginning\r\nof that great period of fever and smallpox in London which continued all\r\nthrough the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe following section of London mortality, down to the end of our present\r\nperiod, will show, by reference to the total deaths, how important the\r\nomitted years are for the epidemiological history.\r\n\r\n  Year     Plague     Fever     Smallpox     Total\r\n                                deaths\r\n\r\n  1629       0          956        72         8771\r\n  1630    1317         1091        40        10554\r\n    31     274         1115        58         8562\r\n    32       8         1108       531         9535\r\n    33       0          953        72         8393\r\n    34       1         1279      1354        10400\r\n    35       0         1622       293        10651\r\n    36   10400         2360       127        23359\r\n    37    3082          --         --        11763\r\n    38     363          --         --        13624\r\n    39     314          --         --         9862\r\n  1640    1450          --         --        12771\r\n    41    1375          --         --        13142\r\n    42    1274          --         --        13273\r\n    43     996          --         --        13212\r\n    44    1492          --         --        10933\r\n    45    1871          --         --        11479\r\n    46    2365          --         --        12780\r\n    47    3597        1260        139        14059\r\n    48     611         884        401         9894\r\n    49      67         751       1190        10566\r\n  1650      15         970        184         8754\r\n    51      23        1038        525        10827\r\n    52      16        1212       1279        12569\r\n    53       6         282        139        10087\r\n    54      16        1371        832        13247\r\n    55       9         689       1294        11357\r\n    56       6         875        823        13921\r\n    57       4         999        835        12434\r\n    58      14        1800        409        14993\r\n    59      36        2303       1523        14756\r\n  1660      13        2148        354        12681\r\n    61      20        3490       1246        16665\r\n    62      12        2601        768        13664\r\n    63       9        2107        411        12741\r\n    64       5        2258       1233        15453\r\n    65   68596        5257        655        97306\r\n  1666    1998         741         38        12738\r\n\r\nThe year 1638, and the four successive years 1640-43, have exceptional\r\nmortalities, which plague alone can by no means account for. In one of\r\nthose years, 1641, we know that smallpox was rife, along with plague, in\r\nthe autumn; in the third week of August there were 118 deaths from\r\nsmallpox (133 from plague), and in the second week of September 101 from\r\nsmallpox (185 from plague), the plague continuing at even higher figures\r\nall through September and October, while smallpox ceases to be mentioned\r\nin the letters of the time[1058]. According to earlier and later\r\nexperience, the epidemic of smallpox would have been followed by a quiet\r\ninterval of that disease; so that the high mortality, beyond what plague\r\ncould account for, would have been due to some other epidemic type. There\r\nis little doubt that that type was fever, less heard of in letters of the\r\nsociety people because it was, in its steady prevalence from year to year,\r\nan infection of the crowded quarters of the poor.\r\n\r\nWe begin about this period to find fever, or typhus fever, taking that\r\nplace in the medical history of England which it continued to hold down to\r\nthe generation before our own. What remains of the history of plague until\r\nits extinction in 1665-66, is so closely interwoven with the history of\r\nmalignant fever, that it will be more convenient to carry the latter on\r\nside by side with it instead of in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nThe first medical essay upon the malignant fever which got the name of\r\ntyphus at the beginning of the 19th century, was that of a physician, Sir\r\nEdward Greaves, published at Oxford in 1643 in connexion with the sickness\r\nin that city while the king and the Royalist army lay there, and with the\r\nsickness in the Parliamentary army of the earl of Essex which lay at\r\nReading. Greaves describes the unmistakable characters of spotted fever or\r\ntyphus, and calls it, in his title “_Morbus Epidemicus Anni 1643_, or the\r\nNew Disease.” In his text he speaks of “this so frequently termed the New\r\nDisease.” The name of “New Disease” was used also for influenza; but there\r\ncan be no doubt that typhus did become common in England during the Civil\r\nWars, between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, which were the first\r\nand also the only sieges and campaigns on English soil that really touched\r\nthe life of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe continent of Europe had been familiar with the same type of fever ever\r\nsince the beginning of the 16th century, now in Italy, now in Spain,\r\nanother time in the Low Countries, or in Hungary, or in Germany in the\r\nThirty Years’ War. Greaves, our first writer on epidemic typhus, had been\r\npreceded a whole century by Fracastori, whose description of the fever at\r\nVerona in 1505 is perhaps the first account of epidemic sickness free from\r\nsubservience to ancient or medieval authority, and based upon direct\r\nobservations made in modern Europe. At the same time typhus or spotted\r\nfever was not new to England in 1643. There is always the difficulty\r\nwhether some epidemics of fever should be called influenza or typhus; but\r\nthe fever of the Black Assizes, as well as the standing “sickness of the\r\nhouse,” was certainly typhus, and so probably was the “new disease” in\r\n1612.\r\n\r\nThe history of fever in England has been partly traced in the chapter on\r\ngaol-fevers in the Tudor period and on the Protean “hot agues,” “new\r\nsickness,” “strange fevers” or influenzas of 1540, 1557-8 and 1580. At a\r\nmuch earlier period, fevers of the same type (with dysenteries,\r\nlienteries, and pestilent sore throats) have been described, with whatever\r\ndetails there are, in connexion with the periodic famines, especially\r\nsince the Conquest. But we are now come to a time in the history when\r\ntyphus fevers appeared in the country unconnected with gaols or with\r\nfamines. We are come, indeed, to the new era of epidemics, which is\r\nrevealed more clearly after the plague was extinguished for good, but was\r\nreally concurrent with the last half-century of plague, preparing, as it\r\nwere, to succeed the long reign of that infection. The Civil Wars may be\r\nadmitted to have given the new types of sickness an impulse, but the wars\r\ndid not originate them, nor did they serve in any way to establish them as\r\nthe predominant forms of epidemic sickness for nearly two centuries.\r\nWhatever it was in the condition of England that favoured the prevalence\r\nof fevers, fluxes, and smallpox, that factor was beginning to make itself\r\nfelt shortly after the Tudor period ended: it continued in operation\r\nthrough all political changes of Restoration, Revolution, and Georgian\r\nrule; and if the conditions at length changed, largely for the better so\r\nfar as the adult population is concerned, and for the better even as\r\nregards infancy, there has followed the “_nova cohors febrium_” of our own\r\ntime, appropriate to its own state of society, as was the old troop\r\nbefore it. This theme is really the subject with which a new volume should\r\nopen; but as the plague-period overlaps its successor the fever-period by\r\nhalf a century, and as one must pay heed to the chronology, it remains to\r\ninsert some facts about fevers in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview of Fever in England to 1643.\r\n\r\nOf the prevalence of malignant fevers in England in the earlier years of\r\nthe 17th century we have only occasional glimpses. Thus, in London in\r\nNovember, 1612, there were several deaths of prominent personages. Prince\r\nHenry, eldest son of James I., died of a fever in the course of that\r\nmonth, the illness being thus referred to by Chamberlain in one of his\r\nletters to Carleton, written on November 12 from London:\r\n\r\n    “It is verily thought that the disease was no other than the ordinary\r\n    ague that hath reigned and raged almost all over England since the\r\n    latter end of summer, which, by observation, is found must have its\r\n    ordinary course, and the less physic the better, but only sweating and\r\n    an orderly course of keeping and government. The extremity of the\r\n    disease seemed to lie in his head [a sure sign of typhus], for remedy\r\n    whereof they shaved him and applied warm cocks and pigeons newly\r\n    killed, but with no success.”\r\n\r\nSir Theodore Mayerne, the king’s physician (who had been driven from Paris\r\nby the intolerance of the Galenists towards those who used antimony and\r\nother Paracelsist remedies), was a good deal blamed because he had purged\r\nthe patient instead of bleeding him.\r\n\r\nWriting again on the 19th November, Chamberlain says: “On Friday Sir Harry\r\nRow, our alderman died, and, same morning, Sir George Carey, master of the\r\nwards, of this new disease.” Chamberlain’s statement that an epidemic\r\nfever, which he calls “the ordinary ague,” had raged all over England from\r\nthe end of summer, 1612, is supported by Short’s abstracts of the parish\r\nregisters for that year, while the following year, 1613, stands out as\r\nstill more unhealthy. The next unwholesome year in Short’s tables is 1616;\r\nand of that sickly time we have one great personal illustration.\r\nShakespeare died on April 23 at Stratford-on-Avon, after three days’\r\nillness of a fever (but possibly of a chill) having just completed his\r\n52nd year. So far as is known, he was not in failing health. It is a\r\nsingular coincidence that he made his will on March 25 preceding, the\r\nfirst day of the year, old style; but the customary phrase, “in perfect\r\nhealth and memory (God be praised!),” would have been perhaps varied a\r\nlittle if illness had been creeping upon him. Now the year 1616 is the\r\nmost unhealthy in Short’s tables from the beginning of the century; the\r\nparish registers do not bear witness again to so much sickness until 1623,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, was a year of typhus. The winter of 1615-16 was\r\naltogether exceptional: warm and tempestuous south-westerly and westerly\r\nwinds prevailed from November until February; on the 8th February, there\r\nwere East Indiamen lying in the Downs, which had been at anchor there for\r\nten weeks waiting for a change of wind to take them down the Channel. The\r\nwarm winds brought “perpetual weeping weather, foul ways and great\r\nfloods,” and brought also an early spring. In the last week of January the\r\narchbishop found a nest of young blackbirds in his garden at Lambeth, and\r\nhad “another sent to him from Croydon about four days after.” That was\r\nproverbially the kind of Christmas to make a fat churchyard; but it is\r\nimpossible to say whether one type of sickness, such as fever,\r\npredominated, as in the preceding sickly years, 1612-13, and in the next\r\nfollowing 1616, namely 1623-24. The following figures from Short’s tables\r\nwill prove, at least, that there was excessive mortality.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1616, twenty-one parish registers out of eighty-eight\r\nexamined, showed excessive mortality, the burials being 601 and the\r\nbaptisms 417, the year 1617 showing a somewhat improved state of health.\r\nIn the market towns for the same two years, the excessive proportion of\r\nburials to christenings is equally striking: of sixteen town registers\r\nexamined, ten showed a bad state of health in 1616 (714 burials to 568\r\nbaptisms), and in 1617, nine towns had 786 burials to 652 baptisms. But\r\nneither in town nor country do the years 1616-17 stand out so unhealthy as\r\nthe years 1623-24. Those two biennial periods are the only very\r\nconspicuous ones in Short’s list for the first quarter of the 17th\r\ncentury, the year 1613 coming next in unhealthiness.\r\n\r\nLet us now seek for any causes such as unwholesome conditions of living\r\nupon which these epidemic fevers might have depended. One of the most\r\nnotorious forms of typhus in the 18th century was the ship-fever. The\r\nproblem how to destroy its infection in the hulls of transports and ships\r\nof war occupied the attention of the men of science, Stephen Hales among\r\nthe rest. Parliament, eager for any cure of so disastrous a pest, voted\r\nsome thousands of pounds to a projector whose method, when tried, resulted\r\nin nothing but the burning of three ships to the water’s edge. This\r\nship-fever became notorious early in the 17th century, having occurred\r\nbefore in 1588. If the Elizabethan naval annals in Hakluyt’s collection\r\nwere less engrossed than they are with adventures and doughty deeds, we\r\nshould probably have had more glimpses of an unwholesome state of things\r\nin the ’tween-decks. At all events there is no doubt that fever infested\r\nthe shipping of England as well as of France about the year 1625. The\r\nconditions on board ship are, of course, special; there might have been\r\nship-fever, when there was no gaol-fever, workhouse-fever, or domestic\r\ntyphus in general. But what happened on board ship was no bad index of\r\nwhat was happening on shore. The nation, both on sea and on land, was\r\nexpanding far beyond its old medieval limits, with very crude notions of\r\nthe elbow-room that it needed. The ideas of cubic space, ventilation, and\r\nthe like, with which we are now so familiar, had then no existence. A few\r\nfacts about the shipping, gaols and houses will serve to illustrate this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThe fleet which sailed from Plymouth to make war on Spain in the autumn of\r\n1625 consisted of 90 sail, and carried 10,000 men. Whether there was\r\novercrowding would depend, of course, on the size of the ships; and it may\r\nbe safely said that the largest ship of the fleet was not a fourth part\r\nthe size of a transport that would be allowed to carry five hundred men\r\ntoday. The expedition came back in a few weeks broken by sickness and\r\nmutiny, just as the expedition of Mansfeld for the relief of the\r\nPalatinate had fared. The wretched state of the thirty ships which arrived\r\nat Plymouth in November, 1625, has been mentioned already. At the same\r\ndate we read of French ships of war also throwing overboard two or three\r\ndead men every day. There are some more precise figures for French ships\r\nin 1627, to be given in the next chapter, which will enable us to measure\r\nthe provocation to ship-fever afforded by the conditions of a transport\r\nservice in those years.\r\n\r\nBesides ship-fever, in the great typhus period of the 18th century, there\r\nused to be named gaol-fever, and workhouse-fever. Of the gaol-fever one\r\nhears little in these years. It was severe in the Queen’s Bench prison in\r\nSouthwark in March, 1579; a petition of that date complains that the\r\nprison held double the usual number, that “the sickness of the house” was\r\nrife, and that near a hundred had died of it there during the previous six\r\nyears, many more having been sick[1059]. “The sickness of the house” is a\r\nname suggestive of what was usual. These events of prison life made little\r\nstir unless they involved the health of classes far removed from the\r\nprison-class, as in the three memorable instances of the Black Assizes at\r\nCambridge, Oxford and Exeter. But it is not certain that even such cases\r\nhave been all recorded, or that instances of gaol-fever spreading to those\r\noutside may not have been more frequent than appears. Whitmore in his book\r\nof 1659 on fevers in London and the country, quotes Bacon’s remarks upon\r\nthe Black Assizes of the Tudor period and adds: “and within this eight or\r\nnine years there happened the like at Southwark, as I am credibly\r\ninformed.” That would have been in the King’s Bench prison some time about\r\n1650, which is not far from the date we have brought the history down\r\nto[1060].\r\n\r\nThe overcrowding of the ships and of the gaols had its counterpart in the\r\ndwelling-houses of London and other towns such as Portsmouth. The\r\nproclamations against the erection of houses on new sites within three\r\nmiles of the city gates continued to be issued to the time of Cromwell.\r\nThe effect of them was merely to call into existence a class of poor\r\ntenements in odd corners or to overcrowd the existing houses. Thus, on\r\nJune 27, 1602: “The council have spied an inconvenient increase of housing\r\nin and about London by building in odd corners, in gardens and over\r\nstables. They have begun to pull down one here and there, lighting in\r\nalmost every parish on the unluckiest, which is far from removing the\r\nmischief[1061].” Again, on February 24, 1623, certain inhabitants of\r\nChancery Lane were indicted at the Middlesex Sessions for subletting, “to\r\nthe great danger of infectious disease with plague and other\r\ndiseases[1062].” Again, in May, 1637, there were found in one house eleven\r\nmarried couples and fifteen single persons; in another the householder had\r\ntaken in eighteen lodgers[1063]. The monstrous window-tax, which did more\r\nthan anything else to breed typhus and perpetuate smallpox, was not\r\nimposed until after the Revolution; but there was enough in the London of\r\nthe Stuarts to explain the great increase of those diseases.\r\n\r\nWe have already had evidence of the wide prevalence of spotted fever in\r\n1624, even in the houses of the rich. In the harvest of 1625, Mead, of\r\nCambridge, heard of much sickness which he calls “ague,” about Royston and\r\nBarkway, localities by no means malarious; so many were ill that the\r\npeople wanted help to gather the harvest out of the fields. The nature of\r\nthese “agues” is a question of great difficulty. The intermissions or\r\nremissions of the country fevers are clearly enough asserted by Willis and\r\nothers, whatever they were; at the same time the general characters of the\r\ndisease, or diseases, are not those of intermittent malarial fever; and\r\n“influenza” does not help us. Chamberlain calls the fever of 1624 “the\r\nspotted fever,” and Sir Theodore Mayerne, physician to James I., in a long\r\nopinion upon the king’s state of health and the treatment, dated Aug. 20,\r\n1624, introduces a paragraph “Ad Febrem Purpuream,” which, he says, was\r\nprevalent that year, “not so much contagious as common through a universal\r\ndisposing cause,” seizing upon many in the same house, and destroying\r\nnumbers, being most full of malignity etc. These various accounts for town\r\nand country point to a form of typhus; and we find that diagnosis\r\nconfirmed for the country fevers which were again widely prevalent a few\r\nyears later, about 1638.\r\n\r\nAmong other statistics in Graunt’s essay of 1662 we find the figures from\r\nthe register of “a parish in Hampshire” from 1569 to 1658. There were\r\nseveral years of excessive mortality in that period just as in Short’s\r\ntables, but the worst were 1638 and 1639--the years of high mortality (not\r\nplague) in London also. Of that mortality in the Hampshire parish Graunt\r\nhas given a brief account, which he seems to have based on first-hand\r\ninformation. The parish contained about 2700 inhabitants, and enjoyed\r\naverage good health during the period of 90 years covered by the figures,\r\nthe births exceeding the deaths by twelve on an average in the year. In\r\nthe year 1638 the deaths were 156 and the births 66 (about the average);\r\nin 1639 the deaths were 114 and the births 55. The cause of this great\r\nexcess of mortality in a country parish was, says Graunt, not plague, “but\r\na malignant fever raging so fiercely about harvest that there appeared\r\nscarce hands enough to take in the corn; which argues, considering there\r\nwere 2700 parishioners, that 7 might be sick for one that died; whereas of\r\nthe plague more die than recover. They lay longer sick than is usual in\r\nplague,” and there were no plague-tokens.\r\n\r\nThis considerable epidemic of fever, which must have affected some\r\nhundreds of people, occurred in a Hampshire parish. In the very same\r\nseason (autumn and winter of 1638) we hear of what is obviously the same\r\nsickness being epidemic all over the county of Monmouth. On April 23,\r\n1639, the sheriff of Monmouthshire thus explained his delay in executing\r\nthe king’s writ for an assessment: “In January last I sent forth my\r\nwarrants for the gathering and levying thereof, but there has been such a\r\ngeneral sickness over all this country, called ‘the new disease,’ that\r\nthey could not possibly be expedited.... Besides, the plague was very hot\r\nin divers parts of the county, as Caerleon, Abergavenny, Bedwelty, and\r\nmany other places[1064].” Here the sheriff uses the same name as Greaves\r\nput on his title-page five years after, and he distinguishes clearly\r\nbetween the fever and the plague. The mayor and others of Northampton, in\r\na memorial to the Recorder, dated May 1, 1638, touching the exclusion of\r\nNorthampton tradesmen from fairs in the vicinity owing to suspicions of\r\nthe plague in their town, had been informed by the physicians that some\r\ncases were of the plague, and some of “the spotted fever[1065].” The same\r\ndistinction had been made at Norwich, in 1636: in October there was a\r\nsuspicion of the plague, “but the physicians say it is some other\r\ncontagious disease which die with the spots[1066].” At Northampton, the\r\ncoexistence of plague and some other sickness is asserted also by the\r\nsheriff (Sept. 18, 1638), who had to excuse himself, like so many other\r\nsheriffs, for his failure to remit the ship-money: he himself and his\r\nservants had had sickness, and the plague was so great and so long in\r\nNorthampton that the county still allowed £148 a week for relief of the\r\nsick. The deaths in that epidemic from March to September were 533[1067].\r\nThe sheriff of Montgomery, making a like excuse on October 25, 1638,\r\nspeaks of the plague only: “It pleased God to visit a great part of the\r\ncounty with the plague, and three of the greatest towns, Machynlleth,\r\nLlanidloes and Newton[1068].” The sheriff of Radnorshire, in his excuse to\r\nthe Privy Council, on November 14, says he could not collect the\r\nship-money at Presteign “by reason of the plague, which continued there\r\nfor two years together, and did not cease until the latter end of April\r\nlast[1069].” We may take it, then, that there was a great deal of plague\r\nin Wales about 1637 and 1638, that there was also “the new disease,” or\r\nspotted fever, all over Monmouth and probably other Welsh counties, that\r\nthe same two forms coexisted at Norwich and Northampton, just as they\r\ncoexisted in London, and that Graunt’s parish in Hampshire in 1638 had\r\nprobably the fever only.\r\n\r\nShort’s statistical tables again bear out the concrete history. In 1638,\r\nnineteen country parishes, out of ninety-four examined, had 699 burials to\r\n542 baptisms, and in 1639, eighteen parishes had 585 burials to 386\r\nbaptisms. In the market towns the unhealthy period (which may have been\r\ndue to plague in great part) is a year earlier. In 1637, ten towns out of\r\ntwenty-four whose registers were added up, show 1474 burials to 1008\r\nbaptisms, the proportion in 1638 for the same number of unhealthy towns\r\nbeing 1438 to 1025.\r\n\r\nIt would have been one of the country epidemics of those years that\r\nBoghurst brings into his account of the plague of London in 1665: “I was\r\ntold by an ancient woman that in Somersetshire the spotted fever was very\r\nepidemical, so that whole families died; but being told that plantan\r\n[plantain] was very good, all of them almost took it, which wrought an\r\nadmirable change, for very few died that took it, whereas before they died\r\nvery fast.” He thinks plantain was as likely to have effected a cure as\r\n“higher priced medicines.” We shall find a corresponding prevalence of\r\nfever described by a competent physician, Whitmore, for rural parts of\r\nCheshire and Shropshire in 1651 and 1658. Thus we have a remarkable\r\nepidemiological phenomenon, somewhat new to England unless, indeed, we\r\nbring all those spotted fevers and the like under the generic name of\r\ninfluenza. It was in country districts in 1612-13 and from 1623 to 1625,\r\nit was extensively prevalent in 1638 in places as far apart as Hampshire,\r\nMonmouth and Northampton, it appeared in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in 1643\r\nin connexion with the military movements of the Royalist and Parliamentary\r\narmies, it caused a disastrous loss of life in Tiverton within a few weeks\r\nof Essex’s army passing through the town in 1644; it is heard of again in\r\nShropshire and Cumberland in 1651-52, and in the same parts in 1658, as\r\nwell as in Somerset, and in London steadily from year to year.\r\n\r\nIt was in its steadiness from year to year in the poor quarters of towns,\r\nas well as in its more frequent recurrences as a country epidemic, that\r\nthe spotted fever deserved the name of “new disease” in the reign of\r\nCharles I. But more than one epidemic fever had been called a “new\r\ndisease” in England before; and no fewer than five epidemics were so\r\ncalled from 1643 to 1685, of which only one or two can be classed among\r\nthe influenzas.\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible to keep in mind the history of sicknesses from\r\ncentury to century or even from generation to generation, the “new\r\ndisease” might have been recognised as not unlike the type that overran\r\nEngland in 1087, that was described by William of Newburgh in 1196, by\r\nMatthew Paris in 1258, and by Trokelowe in 1315-16. The conditions\r\nproducing it or favouring it were not, indeed, the same in all particulars\r\nin the medieval period, in the Tudor period, and in the Stuart period. In\r\nthe medieval period, the extreme want and misery which brought epidemic\r\nsickness were due to occasional sharp famines at long intervals, from\r\nfailure of the crops. In the Tudor period epidemics were still so\r\noccasional (so far as is known) that something more special will have to\r\nbe blamed for them than the swarms of vagrants and criminals all over\r\nEngland, which made the reign of Henry VIII. notorious, and were still a\r\nsource of trouble until late in the reign of Elizabeth; the four chief\r\nperiods were in 1540, 1557-8, 1580-82, and 1596-97 so that some special\r\ncause would have to be assumed in those years to account for their\r\npeculiar “epidemic constitution.” Almost from the beginning of the Stuart\r\nperiod, the seasons of fever (to say nothing of flux and smallpox), seem\r\nto come in quicker succession; they are heard of in 1612-13, 1623-25,\r\n1638, 1643-44, 1651, 1658-9, and 1661-65, and heard of in those years over\r\nwide tracts of rural England as well as in London and other towns. It was\r\nfrom such experiences that the doctrine arose, so unintelligible to us\r\nnow, of an “epidemic constitution of the air,” which may be traced,\r\nindeed, to much earlier writings than those of the 17th century, but finds\r\nits most frequent applications in the latter. The fevers were in part\r\ncontagious and not contagious; contagion could not explain them all, and\r\nyet there was an undoubted infective element in them. The universality or\r\ngenerality of their incidence was accounted for by assuming, on the one\r\nhand, something common in the state of the air and, on the other hand,\r\nsome common predisposition in the bodies of men, which might itself have\r\nhad seasonal causes. We have now only one name for such common infection\r\nof the air, namely influenza; and it is significant that the catarrhal\r\ninfluenzas of 1658 and 1659 were regarded by some at the time as only the\r\nappropriate vernal form of the fever which in the hot weather of 1657 and\r\n1658 had prevailed almost in the same general way as influenza, but with\r\nthe symptoms of typhus. One thing which should not be overlooked, is that\r\nplague was still in the country, not always at the same time as the fever,\r\nand perhaps not usually coincident with it. Another thing, which will come\r\nout in its due order at a later part of the history, is that after the\r\nextinction of plague, fever became far more steady in the towns from year\r\nto year, and in certain years was not less prevalent in influenza-like\r\nepidemics all over the country. One might offer some suggestions as to the\r\nmeaning of these epidemiological phenomena; but it will perhaps be more\r\nconvenient that critics who have a speculative turn or a craving for\r\ngeneralities should exercise the one or gratify the other at their own\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nAlong with the prevalence of plague in 1637-38 in many towns of Wales, we\r\nmay associate the outbreak of 1638 in Gloucester on the one side and in\r\nthe small Salopian town of Clun on the other. From a letter of the Privy\r\nCouncil to the justices of Gloucestershire, it appears that a rate in aid\r\nof the plague-stricken in the city had been imposed upon the county in\r\nDecember, 1637, and that the infection still continued in Gloucester in\r\nSeptember, 1638. Contributions made in Bridgenorth for the relief of the\r\nvisited in Clun appear to belong to the same year. At Reading a tax for\r\nthe “visited” had been collected once or oftener between 1638 and 1641. In\r\n1641 the town of Leicester was put to some expense (£46. 8_s._ 7_d._) in\r\nwatching to keep out the sickness which prevailed in Thurmaston, Birstal,\r\nWhetstone and Oakham. The very severe plague in Stamford the same year\r\nwould have been the most intense part of the epidemic in that corner of\r\nEngland; “Camden,” quoting from bishop Sanderson’s manuscript, says that\r\nit began at St James’s tide, 1641, and ended in March following, whereof\r\nare said to have died between 500 and 600 persons[1070].\r\n\r\nAnother centre of plague in 1641 was Congleton, in Cheshire, if we may\r\ntrust the accuracy of the date given in a manuscript written some time\r\nafter and seemingly based upon tradition[1071]. The infection was traced\r\nto a box of clothes which had belonged to one dead of the plague in London\r\nand were sent to the dead man’s relations at North Rede Hall. The family\r\nwho received the box “caught the infection and died.” It spread “all over\r\nthe country,” and came to Congleton, where it made dreadful ravages. The\r\ntraditions which the anonymous narrator has put on record are, indeed,\r\nthose of a plague of the greater degree--stories of corpses that no one\r\nwould bury, of the sick left to their fate, of money dropped into water\r\nbefore it changed hands. This somewhat doubtful narrative ends with the\r\nstatement that “the greatest part of the inhabitants died.”\r\n\r\nThe period from 1643 to 1650 contains all the outbreaks of plague that\r\nremain, whether in London or the provinces, until we come to the final\r\nexplosion of 1665. In London the plague continued at a low endemic level\r\nfrom the outburst of 1636 until 1648, the deaths in 1647 reaching the\r\nconsiderable figure of 3597. This series of plague-years has no other\r\ninterest than as showing how regularly every season the infection\r\nincreased from a few cases in May or June to a maximum in September or\r\nOctober. One incident, out of many, may find a place. In August, 1647, Sir\r\nPhilip Stapleton, one of the Eleven Members, leaders of the Presbyterian\r\nparty, who were accused of treason by the Army, went over to Calais with\r\nfive more of the accused, and died of the plague almost as soon as he\r\nlanded. The people of the house where he died made the rest of the party\r\npay them £80 before they would let them come forth, for bringing the\r\nsickness into their house[1072].\r\n\r\nThe plagues in provincial towns were in those years much more serious\r\nrelatively than those in London. All of them occurred in towns that were\r\nbesieged, or had been besieged, or had been occupied by bodies of troops\r\nor by garrisons. At the same time most of them were towns which had\r\nsuffered plagues before. But the first effects of the war in the way of\r\nepidemic sickness were not of the type of plague.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar-typhus in Oxfordshire and Berkshire.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring and summer of 1643 that England had a first\r\nexperience of the war-typhus which had been familiar to the continent of\r\nEurope for a century and a half, having reached perhaps its greatest\r\nprevalence in the Thirty Years’ War. It is only in the sense of war-typhus\r\nthat Shakespeare’s boast, put into the mouth of John of Gaunt, holds good:\r\n\r\n  “This fortress, built by nature for herself,\r\n   Against infection and the hand of war.”\r\n\r\nThe medieval civil wars in England do not seem to have bred infection\r\namong the people, unless, perhaps, during the anarchy of Stephen’s reign:\r\nthere is reason to think that the faction-fights of York and Lancaster had\r\nno such result. But the wars of the Parliament against the Royalists\r\nproduced war-sickness in its most characteristic form, and that too, at\r\nthe very beginning of the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe existence of sickness in 1643 among the troops of the Parliament in\r\nBerkshire and Oxfordshire, under the earl of Essex, is briefly stated by\r\nRushworth. But, for the first time in the history, we find a medical\r\naccount of the type of sickness, of its circumstances, and of the extent\r\nof its prevalence, which is not without interest even for the military\r\nhistory. It happened that the afterwards celebrated Dr Thomas Willis,\r\nchemist, anatomist, physiologist and physician, was at Christ Church,\r\nOxford, in 1643, being then aged twenty-one, and intending to enter the\r\nChurch. In 1659 he published at the Hague his first medical essays, one on\r\nFermentation and the other on Fevers[1073]; and in the latter he recalls\r\nmany particulars of what he had seen in his earlier years in and around\r\nOxford. The sickness of 1643 was also the subject of a tract published\r\nthat year in Oxford, by his majesty’s command, by Sir Edward Greaves,\r\nphysician to the king, which appears to have been in sufficient request in\r\nthe town to be reprinted within the year[1074].\r\n\r\nThe preceding events may be briefly summarized[1075]. In November, 1642,\r\nthe king moved from Oxford with his army towards London and seized\r\nBrentford. The forces of the Parliament, under Essex, concentrated round\r\nthe capital, where they were joined by the trainbands of the City, so that\r\nthe king recrossed the Thames at Kingston and retired upon Reading and\r\nOxford. All through the months from January to April 1643, tedious\r\nnegociations went on for a treaty, the details largely relating to the\r\nplaces to be occupied by the Parliamentary troops on the one hand (around\r\nWindsor) and by the Royalist troops on the other (in Oxfordshire and\r\nBucks). In April the negociations fell through, and Essex came before\r\nReading on the 15th, with an army of 15,000 foot and 3000 horse. The king\r\nand prince Rupert attempted to raise the siege by a march from Oxford, but\r\nwere stopped at Caversham bridge, and on the 26th April, Reading was\r\nsurrendered to the Lord General, the garrison marching out the day after.\r\n\r\nThe siege had lasted only eleven days; the Royalist commandant was\r\nsentenced to death at Oxford for betraying the town, but was pardoned.\r\nWhen Essex entered Reading he found the place “infected,” and a great\r\nmortality ensued among his men, who were discontented at the want of\r\nplunder and of pay. In June he moved his troops across the chalk downs to\r\nThame, on the borders of Bucks; but the weather being wet and unseasonable\r\nin the early summer, and afterwards hot, the sickness so increased among\r\nthem that “he judged the design upon Oxford impracticable” (Rushworth),\r\nand on July 9, wrote to the Parliament advising a peace. In his letter,\r\nEssex explained that it was impossible to keep the counties from being\r\nplundered, “so that they must suffer much wrong, and the cries of the\r\npeople are infinite.” Eventually he brought what remained of his army to\r\nthe neighbourhood of London, and having received 2000 recruits from the\r\nCity, he held a muster on Hounslow Heath, when his whole force amounted to\r\n10,000 men. With his recruited army he marched to the relief of\r\nGloucester[1076], raised the siege, and on September 20 won the (first)\r\nbattle of Newbury.\r\n\r\nThe realities of that inactive summer at Reading and Thame may be\r\nconceived from what Willis tells us of the state of things within the\r\nRoyalist lines in Oxfordshire. These things, he says, “fell under our own\r\nobservation,” he being then at Christ Church and not yet entered on the\r\nphysic line.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1643, Reading being held for the king,\r\n\r\n    “In both armies there began a disease to arise very epidemical;\r\n    however they persisting in that work till the besieged were forced to\r\n    a surrender, this disease grew so grievous that in a short time after,\r\n    either side left off and from that time for many months fought not\r\n    with the enemy, but with the disease; as if there had not been leisure\r\n    to turn aside to another kind of death....\r\n\r\n    Essex’s camp moving to Thame, pitched in the places adjacent, where he\r\n    shortly lost a great part of his men.\r\n\r\n    But the king returned to Oxford, where at first the soldiers, being\r\n    disposed in the open fields, then afterwards among the towns and\r\n    villages, suffered not much less. For his foot (which it chiefly\r\n    invaded) being pact together in close houses, when they had filled all\r\n    things with filthiness and unwholesome nastiness and stinking odours\r\n    (that the very air seemed to be infected) they fell sick by troops,\r\n    and as it were by squadrons. At length the fever, now more than a camp\r\n    fever, invaded the unarmed and peaceable troops, to wit, the\r\n    entertainers of the soldiers, and, generally, all others: yet at first\r\n    (the disease being but yet lightly inflicted) though beset with a\r\n    heavy and long languishment, however, many escaped. About the summer\r\n    solstice this fever began also to increase with worse provision of\r\n    symptoms, and to lay hold on the husbandmen and others inhabiting the\r\n    country, then afterwards spread through our city and all the country\r\n    round for at least ten miles about. In the mean time they who dwelt\r\n    far from us in other counties remained free from hurt, being as it\r\n    were without the sphere of the contagion. But here this disease became\r\n    so epidemical that a great part of the people was killed by it; and\r\n    as soon as it had entered a house it ran through the same, that there\r\n    was scarce one left well to administer to the sick. Strangers, or such\r\n    as were sent to help the sick, were presently taken with the disease;\r\n    that at length for fear of the contagion, those who were sick of this\r\n    fever were avoided by those who were well, almost as much as if they\r\n    had been sick of the plague.\r\n\r\n    Nor indeed did there a less mortality or slaughter of men accompany\r\n    this disease; because cachectic and phthisical old men, or other ways\r\n    unhealthful, were killed by it; also not a few children, young men,\r\n    and those of a more mature and robust age. I remember in some villages\r\n    that almost all the old men died this year, that there were scarce any\r\n    left who were able to defend the manners and privileges of the parish\r\n    by the more anciently received traditions[1077].”\r\n\r\nWillis recalls how this epidemic disease changed its type as the season\r\nwore on. At first it was a “putrid synochus,” which seemed to be helped by\r\na sweat or a looseness; a relapse or renewal followed the crisis. Later,\r\nit became a continual fever of six or seven days, with no crisis; when the\r\nfever ceased the sick kept their beds, sometimes raging, more often in a\r\nstupor, great weakness continuing, and sometimes convulsions ensuing.\r\nAbout midsummer “the disease betrayed its malignancy by the eruption of\r\nwhelks and spots.” It would often begin with an insidious languishing, the\r\nstrength being totally withdrawn. At length buboes appeared in many, as in\r\nthe plague. At this time, during the dog-days, the disease began to be\r\nhandled, not as a fever, but as a lesser plague--by vomits, purges, and\r\nsudorifics. The autumn coming on, the disease by degrees remitted its\r\nwonted fierceness, so that fewer grew sick of it, and of them many grew\r\nwell. At the approach of winter the fever almost wholly vanished, and\r\nhealth was fully restored to Oxford and the country round about. Among the\r\nvictims are mentioned “some belonging to the king’s and queen’s Court,\r\nwith a few scholars[1078].”\r\n\r\nOf the causes, Willis says that, so far as concerned the army, the evident\r\ncauses were “errors in the six non-naturals.” The spring was very moist\r\nand “flabbery,” with almost continual showers, to which a hot summer\r\nsucceeded. The tract upon the Oxford fever by Greaves, a short piece of\r\nsome 25 pages, which was written for use in the city during the epidemic,\r\nbears out the account by Willis, without developing the doctrine of\r\nincreasing malignancy. He is concerned to prove that it was not the plague\r\n“as the relations and hopes of your enemies, and the fears of others, have\r\nsuggested.” One of his proofs is the insidious mode of invasion, which\r\nWillis ascribes to the sickness in its later type--great weakness without\r\nany manifest cause appearing, such as sweating or looseness, so that even\r\nstrong men were prostrated, with a quick, weak and creeping pulse,\r\nsometimes intermittent, with pains in the head, vertigo &c. The most\r\ndistinctive thing was the spots; “But what need we any farther signs than\r\nthe spots, which appear upon half the number, at least, of those that fall\r\nsick?” Greaves seems to claim that Oxford had some immunity for a time:\r\n“God hath been most merciful to this city in sparing us heretofore, when\r\nour neighbours round about us were visited.”\r\n\r\nAmong the causes, he mentions putrid exhalations from stinking matters,\r\ndung, carcasses of dead horses and other carrion; “and were there care\r\ntaken for the removing of these noisome inconveniences, and keeping the\r\nstreets sweet and clean, it would doubtless tend much to the abatement of\r\nthe disease.” The diet, also, may have had something to do with it; more\r\nparticularly the brewers should dry their malt better, boil their beer\r\nlonger, and put in a sufficiency of hops. But the great cause was the\r\npresence of the army.\r\n\r\n    “We need not look far for a cause where there is an army residing,\r\n    which the Athenians called to mind in their calamity, or as Homer\r\n    speaks of his Greeks:\r\n\r\n        εἰ δὴ ὁμοῦ πόλεμός τε δαμᾷ καὶ λοιμὸς ’Αχαιούς.\r\n\r\n    --it being seldom or never known that an army, where there is much\r\n    filth and nastiness in diet, worse lodging, unshifted apparel, etc.,\r\n    should continue long without contagious disease.” Whole families were\r\n    infected, “and seldom in any house where sick soldiers of either side\r\n    are quartered, but the inhabitants likewise fall sick of the same\r\n    disease.”\r\n\r\nThere appears to have been the almost inevitable doubt in some minds,\r\nwhether the disease were contagious: “But if anyone be yet obstinate, and\r\nwill not believe it contagious, let him go near and try.” Among the\r\nremedies, he mentions a favourite one of the empiric sort, “Lady Kent’s\r\npowder,” which Willis also refers to; but Greaves, as became an academical\r\nphysician, would not admit that it had any advantage over medicines of\r\nknown ingredients.\r\n\r\nThis widespread epidemic of typhus, perhaps not without some relapsing\r\nfever, and, according to what Willis says in one of his general chapters,\r\ncomplicated, in its diffusive form in the villages around, “with squinancy\r\n[sore throat], dysentery, or deadly sweat,” is the only one medically\r\nrecorded of the Civil Wars. But there was certainly a renewal of it, in\r\nthe same circumstances, next year at Tiverton; and it seems probable, from\r\nthe heavy mortality which the parish registers witness to in that year\r\n(1644) that some kind of epidemic sickness had spread far and near. Thus,\r\nin Short’s abstracts of the burials and christenings in country parishes\r\nand market towns, the years 1643 and 1644, and especially the latter,\r\nstand out as the most unhealthy for a long time before and after, the next\r\nsickly period, as we shall see, being the years 1657-1659. In the year\r\n1643, out of eighty-eight country registers examined, twenty-nine showed a\r\nsickly death-rate, although the disproportion of births to deaths does not\r\nappear great (821 to 847). That was the year of the epidemic fever in\r\nBerkshire, Oxfordshire and Bucks. Next year, which was the year of the\r\nTiverton epidemic, there are again twenty-nine country registers\r\nindicating unusual sickness (715 baptisms to 938 burials). In nineteen out\r\nof twenty-four market towns, the same two years come out still more\r\nunhealthy (844 births to 1193 deaths in 1643 and 1008 births to 1647\r\ndeaths in 1644). The registers examined by Short were mostly from Northern\r\nand Midland parishes; but they included two or three from Devonshire, and\r\namong his market towns was Tiverton. We shall now see what these bald\r\nfigures mean in that concrete instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar-typhus at Tiverton in 1644.\r\n\r\nTiverton was then a town of some 8000 inhabitants, mostly occupied in the\r\nweaving industry. On July 5, 1644, Essex arrived with his army on his way\r\nto Cornwall to subdue prince Maurice, and lay there till the 18th. The\r\ndiary of one farmer Roberts has an entry that Mr Thomas Lawrence, who came\r\nfrom Tiverton, reported to him that the earl had 350 and odd carriages,\r\nand of horse belonging thereto for draught 2000[1079]. This would have\r\nbeen his large artillery train, baggage and ammunition waggons, etc. His\r\ninfantry would be some 6000, and his cavalry perhaps 1000. The king’s\r\nforce meanwhile advanced after Essex, and on July 25 lay in the great\r\nmeadow at Crediton. They had advanced by Yeovil and may or may not have\r\npassed through Tiverton. The two armies came to blows in Cornwall, a\r\nprolonged series of encounters in the country around Lostwithiel in wet\r\nAugust weather ending in the escape of Essex to the coast, the retreat of\r\nhis cavalry through the Royalist lines, and the surrender of the infantry\r\non 1st September. The disarmed foot-soldiers were convoyed back to Poole\r\nand Wareham, and did not trouble Tiverton again. The retreating cavalry\r\npassed that way, but did not enter the town, which was now held by the\r\nRoyalists. But the king’s army came back by the way of Tiverton, which\r\nthey reached on Saturday, the 21st September. They had got no farther than\r\nChard on the 30th, and may have halted in Tiverton some days. A Royalist\r\ngarrison of 200 men was left in it, and held the place until October 1645,\r\nwhen it was taken by Fairfax after a short siege[1080].\r\n\r\nTiverton was thus occupied by both armies in the summer and autumn of\r\n1644, that of Essex having been quartered in and around the town for a\r\nfortnight in July. A serious epidemic followed, especially in the suburb\r\non the western side of the Exe. The particulars of it are in the parish\r\nregister, from which it would appear that the sickness began in August and\r\nlasted until November. The greatest mortality was in October, when 105\r\nwere buried, the whole mortality of the year having been 443. The ordinary\r\nmonthly burials would hardly have exceeded a dozen or fifteen; and as the\r\n105 burials in October would have meant some eight or ten times as many\r\nsick, it is not surprising to read that the town was desolate, and that\r\ngrass grew in the streets[1081]. Of this epidemic there are no medical\r\nparticulars; but it appears from the parish register that it was known as\r\n“the sweating sickness.” It would hardly have been so called if sweating\r\nhad not been a prominent symptom. Besides the English sweat proper, with\r\nits five epidemics from 1485 to 1551, we have had occasion to notice a\r\nsweating type in several epidemics of fever. That symptom was so marked in\r\nthe epidemic of 1558 at Southampton, Portsmouth, and Isle of Wight when\r\nthey were full of troops, that Dr John Jones, who had personal experience\r\nof it, compares it to the sweat proper. It was a sufficiently prominent\r\nsymptom in the Oxford gaol-fever of 1577 for the _sudor Anglicus_ to be\r\ncalled to mind. In the English fevers and influenzas of 1580-82, a sweat\r\nor a lask is mentioned by Cogan as a least occasional; but the fevers of\r\nthe same years on the Continent had so often the sweating character that\r\nit was sometimes said the English sweat had come back. Lastly for the\r\nwar-fevers of 1643 around Reading and Oxford, Willis asserts in more than\r\none place the occurrence of sweats, critical or giving relief for a time\r\nin the milder form, “deadly sweats” in fevers of an aggravated type. To\r\nanticipate somewhat, it may be mentioned also that a sweating character is\r\nrecorded of some cases of the perennial London typhus at its worst period\r\nin the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nAdmitting all these facts, we must still hold to the opinion expressed in\r\nthe chapter on the Sweating Sickness, that sweating was never again the\r\n_signum pathognomicum_ of a whole epidemic, as it had been of the sudor\r\nAnglicus in its five outbursts. But if there be gradations of type, or\r\napproximations of typhus to sweating sickness (as well as to influenza),\r\nthen we may perhaps take the Tiverton epidemic as coming nearer than any\r\nother to the sweating sickness, on the strength of the name given to it in\r\nthe parish register.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of sickness in the army of Essex, which lay at Tiverton\r\nfrom 5th to 18th July, 1644. It suffered much in the fighting in Cornwall,\r\nand the Parliament on 7 September sent to Portsmouth arms for 6000 foot\r\nand 6000 suits of clothes and shirts for the infantry who had surrendered\r\nand been convoyed back along the coast. The king’s troops which occupied\r\nTiverton on 21 September on their way back, had doubtless suffered also,\r\nfrom the campaigning in wet fields and miry ways, and are known to have\r\nbeen discontented for want of pay. Probably the epidemic at Tiverton was\r\ndue to aggravation of the usual circumstances of war. It must be classed\r\nas a form of typhus; while its distinctive character of sweating might\r\nfind an explanation, on the analogy of the sweat of 1485 in London after\r\nthe arrival of Henry VII. from Bosworth Field, if we had sufficient reason\r\nto suppose that the soldiers who successively occupied Tiverton were not\r\nthemselves suffering from fever. Contact alone, especially the contact _en\r\nmasse_ of men reduced by hardships and disorderly in their habits, will\r\nsometimes serve to breed contagion among a population unlike them in these\r\nrespects. The converse of that principle, namely that contagion need not\r\nfollow from the introduction of developed sickness _en masse_, finds an\r\nillustration in the case of Tiverton itself within little more than a year\r\nafter the epidemic of 1644. In November, 1645, Fairfax lay at Ottery St\r\nMary with his army, pending the investment of Exeter. On account of much\r\nsickness and heavy mortality among his infantry (not medically described)\r\nhe removed them on December 2, to Crediton and ultimately to Tiverton,\r\nwhich was supposed to be a healthier situation and became his\r\nhead-quarters until January 8, 1646[1082]. But no outbreak in the town is\r\nmentioned, and almost certainly none occurred; the health of the place\r\ncontinued to be good every year of the time that it was under the rule of\r\nthe Parliament, as the parish register proves. On the other hand Totness,\r\nwhich was occupied by the same convalescent force after it left Tiverton,\r\nhad a severe epidemic of plague in the end of the year, 1646.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in the Provinces during the Civil Wars.\r\n\r\nThe type of sickness, after the first two years of the war, does not\r\nappear to have been typhus-fever, but always the old bubo-plague of the\r\ntowns. So far as the history is known, the experience of war-sicknesses\r\nupon English soil began in 1643 and ended in 1644, except in the instance\r\nof Fairfax’s troops at Ottery St Mary in November, 1645.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the “new model” of the Parliamentary forces, after the pattern of\r\nCromwell’s Ironsides, may have had something to do with the immunity of\r\nEngland from war-typhus in all the marchings and counter-marchings,\r\nbattles, occupations and sieges, from 1645 to the end of the Civil Wars.\r\nCromwell pointed out to Hampden that the army of Essex was composed of “a\r\nset of poor tapsters and town-apprentices,” and gave it as his opinion\r\nthat these were not the men to win with. When the original commanders,\r\nEssex, Manchester, Sir W. Waller, and others, had retired in 1645, terms\r\nof the self-denying ordinance, the army of the Parliament acquired a new\r\ncharacter under Fairfax and Cromwell: it contained a large proportion of\r\n“men of religion,” especially among the officers; and there is sufficient\r\nevidence that the war was in future carried on so as to produce as few as\r\npossible of those effects of campaigning among the people at large which\r\nhad marked the Thirty Years’ War in Germany and had attended the\r\noperations of Essex and the Royalists in 1643 and 1644.\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be said of the epidemics of the Civil Wars relates almost\r\nexclusively to plague, with an occasional reference to the spotted fever\r\nwhich was widely prevalent in the autumn of 1644. These epidemics of\r\nplague in the English provinces, during the political troubles, more\r\nnumerous than usual from 1644 to 1650, are the last on English soil until\r\nwe come to the final grand explosion of 1665-66.\r\n\r\nIn 1644 there were two principal centres of plague (besides London),\r\nnamely Banbury, and the valley of the Tyne. Banbury was near enough to the\r\nRoyalist head-quarters to have shared in the fever-epidemic of 1643; in\r\nthat year the burials of 58 soldiers are entered in the parish register,\r\nbesides a large excess of burials among the civil population (total of 225\r\ndeaths in the year as against an annual mortality in former years ranging\r\nfrom 30 to 98). The siege by the Parliamentary forces did not begin until\r\nJuly 19, 1644, and ended in the surrender of the castle in October. The\r\nepidemic of plague may have begun as early as January, a soldier having\r\n“died in the street” on the 16th; but it is not until March 1644, that\r\nplague-deaths appear in the register. In that month there were 10 deaths\r\nfrom plague, in April 34, and so until November, when there were 2, the\r\ntotal mortality from plague having been 161. After the plague ceased, the\r\ntown remained otherwise unhealthy until 1647[1083].\r\n\r\nThe information as to Newcastle and Tyneside comes from the observant\r\nScotsman, William Lithgow, who was with the Presbyterian army when\r\nNewcastle was stormed on October 20, 1644[1084]. The town had suffered\r\nheavily from plague, as we have seen, in 1636, and there had been a\r\nslighter outbreak in 1642. Although the state of things during the siege\r\nin 1644 was wretched in the extreme, there does not appear to have been\r\nplague until after the surrender. The infection was already at work,\r\nhowever, in places near. Thus Tynemouth Castle was surrendered by the\r\nRoyalist commander, Sir Thomas Riddell on October 27: “The pestilence\r\nhaving been five weeks amongst them, with a great mortality, they were\r\nglad to yield, and to scatter themselves abroad; but to the great undoing\r\nand infecting of the country about, as it hath contagiously begun”\r\n(Lithgow). Among the places infected were Gateshead, Sandgate, Sunderland,\r\nand many country villages, the plague being reported in Newcastle itself\r\nin 1645 as well as in Darlington[1085].\r\n\r\nThe year 1645 was one of severe plague in several towns at the same time,\r\nsome of them in a state of siege and all of them occupied by troops. The\r\nlargest mortality was at Bristol, being proportionate to its size. The\r\ntown was taken by prince Rupert on July 22, 1643, and was held by a strong\r\ngarrison for two years and some weeks. It was towards the end of the\r\nRoyalist occupation that the plague broke out, probably in the spring of\r\n1645[1086]. On the 16th May, Sir John Culpepper wrote to Lord Digby: “The\r\nsickness increases fearfully in this city. There died this week according\r\nto the proportion of 1500 in London[1087].” When it had been stormed by\r\nFairfax and Cromwell in September 1645, it was found that prince Rupert’s\r\ngarrison consisted of 2500 foot, and about 1000 horse. The auxiliaries and\r\nthe trained bands of the town were reduced in June to about 800, and of\r\nthe 2500 families then remaining in the town, 1500 were in a state of\r\nindigence and want[1088]. In Cromwell’s despatch of September 14 to Mr\r\nSpeaker Lenthall he says: “I hear but of one man that hath died of the\r\nplague in all our army, although we have quartered amongst and in the\r\nmidst of infected persons and places[1089].” The deaths from plague in the\r\nwhole epidemic approached 3000, according to the MS. calendars[1090].\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on within the walls of Bristol, an epidemic of plague\r\nmore severe for the size of the town was progressing at Leeds. The town\r\nhad been taken by Fairfax on January 23, 1643, and had remained in the\r\nquiet possession of the Parliament, under a military governor. In August,\r\n1644, there were buried 131 persons, “before the plague was perceived,”\r\nsays the parish register; which means that the excessive mortality was not\r\nfrom plague, but probably from the spotted fever which reigned that autumn\r\nin other places in the North. The plague proper began with a death in\r\nVicar-lane on March 11, 1645. The weekly bills of mortality which were\r\nordered by the military governor showed a total mortality, from March 11\r\nto December 25, of 1325. It raged most in Vicar-lane and the close yards\r\nadjoining; it was also very prevalent in March-lane, the Calls, Call-lane,\r\nLower Briggate, and Mill-hill. The largest number of burials in a week\r\n(126) was from July 24 to 31; the mortality kept high all through August\r\nand September (60 to 80 weekly), and declined gradually to 3 in the week\r\nending Christmas-day. Whitaker estimates that probably the fifth part of\r\nthe population died, and he cannot discover any person of name among the\r\nvictims. The air was so warm and infectious that dogs, cats, mice and rats\r\nare said to have died (of rats and mice it can well be believed), and that\r\nseveral birds dropped down dead in their flight over the town[1091]. This\r\nappears to have been the only visitation of plague in Leeds, at least\r\nsince the medieval period.\r\n\r\nThe plague of Lichfield in 1645-46, like that of Bristol, went on during a\r\nconstant state of military turmoil. On April 21, 1643, the Close was taken\r\nby prince Rupert and was held as a Royalist stronghold until July 26,\r\n1646, the king having repaired thither after his defeat at Naseby in June,\r\n1645, and again in September. The plague is said to have been active both\r\nin 1645 and 1646; in twelve streets there occurred 821 deaths, the largest\r\nshare (121) falling to Green Hill[1092]. In what way the state of siege\r\nmay have contributed to the plague is uncertain. The fosse was drained dry\r\nat one stage, and was choked with rubbish at another. Many of the\r\ninhabitants of the town would appear, from the 4th article of the\r\ncapitulation, to have taken refuge with their effects within the fortified\r\nCathedral Close, which was almost enclosed by water. This was one of\r\nseveral outbreaks of plague that Lichfield had suffered since early Tudor\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nMinor plague outbreaks of 1645 were at Derby and Oxford. Of the latter we\r\nhave a glimpse from Willis of Christ Church.\r\n\r\n    “Sometime past in this city [Oxford] _viz._, 1645, the plague (tho’\r\n    not great) had spread. Doctor Henry Sayer, a very learned physician,\r\n    and happy in his practice, many others refusing this province, boldly\r\n    visited all the sick, poor as well as rich, daily administered to them\r\n    physic, and handled with his own hands their buboes and virulent\r\n    ulcers, and so cured very many sick by his sedulous though dangerous\r\n    labour. That he might fortifie himself against the contagion, before\r\n    he went into the infected houses, he was wont only to drink a large\r\n    draught of sack, and then his perambulation about the borders of death\r\n    and the very jaws of the grave being finished, to repeat the same\r\n    antidote.\r\n\r\n    After he had in this city, as if inviolable as to the plague, a long\r\n    while taken care of the affairs of the sick without any hurt, he was\r\n    sent for to Wallingford Castle, where this disease cruelly raged, as\r\n    another Æsculapius, by the governor of the place. But there, being so\r\n    bold as to lie in the same bed with a certain captain (his intimate\r\n    companion), who was taken with the plague, he quickly received the\r\n    contagion of the same disease; nor were the arts then profitable to\r\n    the master which had been helpful to so many others, but there with\r\n    great sorrow of the inhabitants, nor without great loss to the\r\n    medical science, he died of that disease.” He treated the sick, in the\r\n    pre-bubonic stages, by a vomit of Crocus Metallorum, and then by\r\n    diaphoretics[1093].\r\n\r\nNone of the other localized epidemics of plague in those years would\r\nappear to have been of the first magnitude. Thus, the 22 deaths from\r\nplague at Loughborough from 1645 to May 14, 1646, and the renewed\r\nprevalence, after a year’s interval, (83 plague-deaths from July 20, 1647\r\nto March 25, 1648)[1094], are samples of local mortalities from plague\r\nthat other parish registers might bear witness to if they had been\r\nexamined by antiquaries as closely as Nichols examined those of\r\nLeicestershire.\r\n\r\nNewark was one of the towns which suffered much during the Civil War.\r\nBesieged time after time, it was at length surrendered to the Parliament\r\non May 6, 1646. A letter written shortly after the surrender says[1095]:\r\n\r\n    “Truly it is become a miserable, stinking, infected town. I pray God\r\n    they do not infect the counties and towns adjacent.... By reason of\r\n    the sickness in divers places, the officers dare not yet venture to\r\n    fetch out the arms.... Tradesmen are preparing to furnish their shops\r\n    ... but the market cannot be expected to be much whilst the sickness\r\n    is in the town.”\r\n\r\nThe parish register of Newark bears no witness to deaths from plague; but\r\nthat of the adjacent parish of Stoke, in which stood the Castle and the\r\nsuburb of Newark surrounding it, has numerous entries of plague-deaths,\r\nbeginning with one some three weeks after the surrender, on May 28, 1646,\r\nand continuing through July, August, and September. Several of the same\r\nhousehold are buried in one day, one is “buried in the field,” another “in\r\nhis croft.” The vicar sums up the mortality thus: “There dyed in the towne\r\nof Stoke, 1646, eight score and one, whereof of the plage seven score and\r\nnineteen.” The whole deaths in Stoke parish the year before had been nine,\r\nand the year after they were six[1096]. If the plague had been at all\r\nproportionate in Newark town itself, the deaths would have far exceeded\r\n159; but, as the parish register does not record plague-deaths at all, it\r\nmay be inferred that the infection lay mostly around the Castle.\r\n\r\nWhitmore speaks of having practised in the plague in Staffordshire in\r\n1647-8, and there is some other evidence, without particulars, of an\r\nepidemic in the town of Stafford.\r\n\r\nOne more epidemic of plague is reported from the theatre of Civil War in\r\nthe south-west, the outbreak at Totness in 1646-7. In the parish register\r\nthere is a burial entered on July 30, 1646, “suspected she died of the\r\nplague.” A leaf of the register has the following: “From December 6, 1646,\r\ntill the 19th October, 1647, there died in Totness of the plague 262\r\npersons”--a number greater than the register shows in detail. The\r\nstereotyped remark is added, that the town was deserted and that grass\r\ngrew in the streets[1097]. For months before the first suspected case of\r\nplague in 1646, Totness had been occupied by one body of troops after\r\nanother. In November or December, 1645, Goring’s Royalist cavalry, to the\r\nnumber of nearly 5000, were quartered at Totness and two or three other\r\nplaces near. On January 11, 1646, Fairfax came with his army to Totness\r\nfor the siege of Dartmouth, which was carried by storm on the 20th. The\r\nLord General then withdrew to resume the investment of Exeter. Before\r\ndoing so he issued warrants to four Hundreds to assemble their men at\r\nTotness on the 24th January. The men came in to the number of about 3000,\r\nand a regiment was formed from them[1098]. What connexion with the plague\r\nin the end of the year all this military stir at Totness may have had, it\r\nwould not be easy to determine. There had been a great deal of sickness in\r\nthe army of Fairfax while it lay at Ottery St Mary in the latter half of\r\nNovember, 1645. “By reason of the season,” says Rushworth, “and want of\r\naccommodation, abundance of his army, especially the foot, were sick, and\r\nmany died, seldom less than seven, eight or nine in a day in the town of\r\nAutree, and amongst the rest Colonel Pickering died and some other\r\nofficers. The Royal party had notice of this consumption of Fairfax’s\r\narmy,” and took heart to make a new effort. The type of sickness is\r\nunknown; but it was such as to cause the removal of the head-quarters on\r\nDecember 2 to Tiverton, for better air. The army lay there until January\r\n8, and came to Totness, for the siege of Dartmouth, on the 11th. Thus\r\nTotness had not only been occupied by an army some months before the\r\nplague, but by an army which had lately had a fatal form of sickness in\r\nit. The troops march away, and the historical interest goes with them;\r\nwhat they may have left behind them concerns only the domestic history.\r\nFifty-six years had passed since Totness had the plague before; and on\r\nthat occasion the epidemic was equally disastrous.\r\n\r\nTwo other centres of plague in 1646-7 are casually mentioned, one at\r\nReading[1099], which affected “a great number of poor people,” and the\r\nother at Carlisle[1100]. Of the latter there are no particulars; but the\r\ncircumstances of the town for several years were such as to make an\r\noutbreak of plague in 1646 credible.\r\n\r\nCarlisle suffered much from the war for a series of years. In July, 1644,\r\nit was seized for the Royalists, and was besieged by Lesley in October,\r\nthe siege lasting many months. It had a garrison of about 700, including\r\nsome of the townsfolk armed. About the end of February, 1645, all the corn\r\nin the town was seized to be served out on short allowance; on June 5,\r\n“hempseed, dogs and rats were eaten.” The surrender was on June 25, and\r\nthe place was held by a Scots garrison until December, 1646. It was again\r\nseized for the Royalists in April, 1648, was recaptured by Cromwell in\r\nOctober, and held by a strong garrison of 800 foot and a regiment of\r\nhorse, besides dragoons to keep the borders. All Cumberland was in such a\r\nstate of destitution that the Parliament ordered a collection for its\r\nrelief; numbers of the poor are said to have died in the highways, and\r\n30,000 families were in want of bread[1101].\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in Scotland during the Civil Wars.\r\n\r\nConnecting with plagues in the north of England, there was a great\r\nprevalence of the infection in Scotland. After the storming of Newcastle\r\nby the Scots Covenanters in October, 1644, the plague appeared in\r\nEdinburgh, Kelso, Borrowstownness, Perth and other places. On April 1,\r\n1645, Kelso was burned down, the fire having originated in a house that\r\nwas being “clengit” or disinfected after plague in it. At Edinburgh the\r\nplague-stricken were housed in huts in the King’s park below Salisbury\r\nCrags. Collections were made for the relief of people in Leith\r\nimpoverished by the plague. The epidemic in and around Perth is said to\r\nhave given rise to the story of Bessie Bell and Mary Gray, who fled from\r\nthe plague-tainted ground and built themselves a bower by a burn\r\nside[1102]. At Glasgow the infection was severe in the end of 1646, and\r\ndid not cease entirely until the autumn of 1648. There are numerous\r\nreferences to it in the letters of principal Baillie of Glasgow\r\nUniversity, of which the following are the most important[1103].\r\n\r\nOn September 5, 1645, he writes that the pest has laid Leith and Edinburgh\r\ndesolate, and rages in many more places: never such a pest seen in\r\nScotland (in his time, perhaps). About January, 1646, he writes of “the\r\ncrushing of our nation by pestilence and Montrose’s victories.” At the end\r\nof that year, the plague was in Glasgow: on January 26, 1647, during\r\nwinter cold, “all that may are fled out of it.” On June 2, the plague had\r\nscattered the St Andrews’ students, the principal of St Leonard’s College\r\nwas dead of it, and it was killing many in the north. The same summer,\r\nprincipal Baillie was shut up in the town of Kilwinning, cut off, with all\r\nthe inhabitants, from communication with the outer world owing to a\r\nsuspicion of plague in the place. Edinburgh and Leith, which had suffered\r\nearliest, were almost free in the autumn of 1647, but “Aberdeen, Brechin\r\nand other parts of the north are miserably wasted; the schools and\r\ncolleges now in all Scotland, but Edinburgh, are scattered.” Glasgow had\r\nits worst experience of plague in the summer and autumn of 1648, which\r\nwere wet seasons: on August 23, “our condition for the time is sad; the\r\nplague is also in Edinburgh and Aberdeen.... At this time I grieved for\r\nthe state of Glasgow.... My brother’s son’s house was infected; my\r\nbrother’s house enclosed many in danger; one night near a dozen died of\r\nthe sickness.... The long great rains for many weeks did prognosticate\r\nfamine; but these three days past there is also a great change of weather;\r\nthe Lord continue it.” The infection which began at Glasgow in January,\r\n1647, reached Aberdeen in April, having been carried, it was said, by a\r\nwoman from Brechin. It was still raging at Aberdeen in September, and\r\nthere were straggling cases as late as November of the following year\r\n(1648). The deaths from plague are put down at 1600, besides 140 in the\r\nadjacent fishing villages of Futtie and Torrie on either side of the Dee\r\nmouth. This enormous mortality ensued despite the usual rigorous\r\nmeasures--the removal of the infected to huts on the Links and\r\nWoolmanhill, a cordon of soldiers to shut them in, a gibbet for the\r\ndisobedient, and “clengers” for the infected houses[1104]. This disastrous\r\nepidemic of 1647-1648 is the last that is heard of plague in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in Chester &c. and in Ireland, 1647-1650.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining English plagues of those years were both in cities that\r\nhad suffered much from plague before, and were in a constant state of\r\nturmoil during the war, namely Chester and Shrewsbury. Chester was held\r\nfor the king, and surrendered to the Parliament on February 3, 1646, after\r\na siege of twenty weeks, during the latter part of which there was famine\r\nwithin the walls. It was not until 1647 that plague broke out. From June\r\n22 until April 20, 1648, the numbers that died of plague are stated in the\r\nMS. of Dr Cowper to have been 2099; all business was suspended, and cabins\r\nfor the plague-stricken were built outside the town[1105].\r\n\r\nThe Shrewsbury plague of 1650, like that of Chester, is described as\r\nhaving been dreadful in its effects upon the town. It broke out during the\r\noccupation by the Parliament’s troops, on June 12, 1650, in a house in\r\nFrankwell, and continued until January, 1651. Only one parish, St Chad’s,\r\nappears to have kept account of the plague-deaths: in that register from\r\nJune 12 to January 16, there are entered 277 burials, whereof of the\r\nplague 250, the highest monthly mortality (76) being in August, 1650. Of\r\nthese 250 deaths, 123 took place in the pest-houses. A letter of August 21\r\nsays that 153 died in two months, and that there were near 3000 people in\r\nthe town dependent upon common charity[1106]. On November 21, there were\r\nstill 200 cases in the pest-houses, most of them being in the way to\r\nrecover, as usually happened towards the end of an epidemic through the\r\ngreater readiness of the buboes to suppurate.\r\n\r\nFrom the small number of burials due to ordinary causes in the St Chad’s\r\nregister, it would appear that many citizens had fled. The severity of\r\nincidence upon certain houses appears from the fact that five servants in\r\nMr Rowley’s house died of it; and that 15 out of 21 burials in St Julian’s\r\nparish came from four families[1107]. These are incidents like those of\r\nthe great plague of London in 1665, which is the next in time in the\r\nEnglish annals after Shrewsbury’s visitation in 1650.\r\n\r\nThe plague in Ireland in 1649-50 was connected, directly and indirectly,\r\nwith the military operations under Ireton and Cromwell. The previous year,\r\n1648, had been one of famine: at the attack on Kildare by the rebels in\r\nthe spring, both the English garrison in the town and the attacking Irish\r\nwere half-starved, and there was a great mortality on both sides, as well\r\nas a murrain of cattle. On May 4, corn in all the rebel quarters is said\r\nto be at the incredible price of £8 the quarter, both men and cattle dying\r\nin large numbers[1108]. In 1649 the plague broke out in Kilkenny, obliging\r\nthe supreme council of Confederate Catholics to remove to Ennis. Ireton,\r\n“thinking he ought not to meddle with what the Lord had so visibly taken\r\ninto his hands, has declined taking Kilkenny into his own.” But Cromwell\r\nbesieged it on March 23, 1650, by which time the garrison of 200 horse and\r\n1,000 foot had been reduced to 300 men through the ravages of the plague,\r\nthe inhabitants having also suffered heavily[1109].\r\n\r\nThe Royalist letters from the Hague speak of the plague in the summer of\r\n1650 as disastrous in Ireland, particularly in Dublin[1110]. On August\r\n5/15: “Lady Inchiquin came hither last night; those with her report that\r\nthe plague will devour what the sword has not in Ireland.” On September\r\n2/12: “All I hear out of Ireland is that the plague has made a horrid\r\ndevastation there; 1100 in a week died in Dublin”--an improbable\r\nestimate[1111]. The ranks of the rebels were so thinned by the sword and\r\npestilence that “not above 200 suffered by the hands of the executioner,”\r\nafter trial at the high court of justice held in County Cork in\r\n1651[1112]. The epidemic appears to have ceased in the autumn of 1650,\r\nwhen the Council of State, in a despatch to the Lord Deputy, take notice\r\nof the goodness of God in stopping the plague[1113].\r\n\r\n\r\nFever in England, 1651-2.\r\n\r\nBetween those plagues of the years 1644-1650 and the final re-appearance\r\nof the infection on English soil from 1665 to 1666, the interval is\r\noccupied with a good deal of fever both in town and country. The\r\nsicknesses of those years are of interest as having been described by two\r\ncompetent physicians, Willis and Whitmore.\r\n\r\nThere were two principal periods of the epidemics, the years 1651-2 and\r\n1657-9. In the former period the sickness appears to have been mostly in\r\nthe north-west. Whitmore, who had seen practice in the Civil War, in\r\nStaffordshire and Shropshire, appears to have been in Chester in 1651, and\r\nwas settled in London in 1657. It is from him that our information mostly\r\ncomes[1114].\r\n\r\n    “It is well known,” he says, “that this disease in the year 1651 [the\r\n    same fever that he describes more fully for the years 1658 and 1659]\r\n    first broke out by the seaside in Cheshire, Lancashire, and North\r\n    Wales.... In Cheshire in the year 1651 this disease seized most upon\r\n    the country people who were laborious, the seeds being sooner\r\n    dispersed in them through the agitation of the humours and spirits in\r\n    their harvest labours, than on those who lead a more sedentary life;\r\n    and that might be one reason why we were so free in the city of\r\n    Chester, when within three or four miles of us round about, whole\r\n    towns were infected with it, there being 80 and 100 sick at a time in\r\n    small villages, as at Stanney, Dunham-on-the-hill, Norton and all\r\n    there abouts by the water side it extremely raged.”\r\n\r\nWhitmore refers to something that he had written, “for my private use,” on\r\nthe subject of this fever as far back as 1642; he remarks also that it\r\nraged every autumn in some place or other of the kingdom, and mentions his\r\nown experience in Staffordshire and Shropshire during the late war. But it\r\nis the epidemic in Cheshire, Lancashire and North Wales, in 1651 that he\r\nspecially describes, side by side with those of 1658 and 1659; and it is\r\nof interest to note his suggestion as to the origin of the fever on both\r\nshores of the Mersey. It was well known that the fever in 1651 first broke\r\nout by the seaside in Cheshire, Lancashire and North Wales:\r\n\r\n    “And if it were observed in Holland that on a misty day, that\r\n    infectious disease the Sudor Anglicus came into Amsterdam in an\r\n    afternoon, five hundred or more dying that night of it, as Lemnius\r\n    reports, I know not why we may not as well suppose their opposite\r\n    neighbour, Dublin, then visited for two years with the plague, should\r\n    not have communicated the same to them though in a more remiss\r\n    degree.”\r\n\r\nHere the suggestion is that the prevalence of plague on the opposite coast\r\nof Ireland had given rise to a minor and “more remiss” contagion along the\r\ncoasts of North Wales, Cheshire and Lancashire. But the plague had been\r\nmost severe in Chester itself before it broke out in Ireland, and had been\r\nsevere in Shrewsbury at the same time as in Ireland. Whatever the theory,\r\nit is significant that the corner of England which was the worst and\r\nperhaps only seat of plague in 1648 and 1650, was the seat of a malignant\r\nfever in 1651, the former having been in the towns, and the latter in the\r\ncountry villages.\r\n\r\nWe get a glimpse of a heavy mortality among the country people the year\r\nafter at Bootle, in Cumberland, just across the border from\r\nLancashire[1115]. On July 8, 1652, Thomas Wharton writes from Kirkdale to\r\nEdward Moore:\r\n\r\n    “There was a boy at widow Robinson’s died upon Saturday in Whitsun\r\n    week, and upon the Wednesday before he was sawying at the steward\r\n    Worsley’s house with his wrights. The boy and the steward’s man slept\r\n    together in Worsley’s barn; towards night the boy was not well, and\r\n    could work no longer. All this John Wiggan of Kirkdale did see. Next,\r\n    John Birch died, and four of his children--all are dead but his wife.\r\n    At John Robinson’s, one child and his wife died last week, and upon\r\n    Wednesday last two children more died; and it was thought by the\r\n    constable of Bootle that he would be dead before this day at night.\r\n    Upon Wednesday at night last, at James Pye’s, there died two, his son\r\n    and daughter; and a servant of Thomas Doubie’s is dead; and it is this\r\n    day broken forth in Bridge’s, as we hear.”\r\n\r\nOn what evidence this country epidemic is called “the plague” by the\r\nantiquary who prints the document does not appear. The fatality of the\r\ndisease would suggest plague, rather than fever; but the fever itself\r\nwould seem to have been more malignant at one place than another, and at\r\none time than another, and there may have been at Bootle cases unmentioned\r\nwhich recovered. If it had been true bubo-plague, it is a solitary\r\ninstance, so far as records go, in the fifteen years between the\r\nextinction of plague at Shrewsbury in 1650, and its revival in London and\r\nelsewhere in 1665. The epidemic disease that we ordinarily hear of in that\r\ninterval is fever; and of the fever our best accounts, after Whitmore’s\r\nreference to 1651, are of the epidemics in 1657, 1658 and 1659.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever and Influenza, 1657-9.\r\n\r\nThe account by Willis of three consecutive epidemics in the autumn of\r\n1657, the spring of 1658, and the autumn of 1658, is of peculiar interest\r\nfor the reason that it is the first systematic piece of epidemiology\r\nwritten in England, and that the middle epidemic of the three was one of\r\ninfluenza[1116]. On reading the narrative of events by Willis, we can\r\nunderstand how it was that the physicians of that period were so impressed\r\nby the doctrine of an epidemic constitution of the season, and by its\r\ncounterpart doctrine of a seasonal predisposition in the human\r\nconstitution. That teaching was afterwards expounded in successive essays\r\nby Sydenham; but it was held generally in those times, and Willis found\r\napt illustrations of it in the three epidemics one after the other in\r\n1657-58. Let us follow his narrative, and add to it some particulars from\r\nWhitmore.\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer of 1657 were extremely dry and hot; but especially\r\nafter the summer solstice the heats were so intense for many weeks\r\nfollowing that, day and night, there was none that did not complain of the\r\nheat of the air, and were almost in a continual sweat and were not able to\r\nbreathe freely. About the calends of July, the fever which was at first\r\nsporadic and particular, began to break forth in some places, perhaps two\r\nor three cases in the same city or village. The fever fits at this period\r\noccurred every other day, but there was no cold fit or rigor preceding, as\r\nin an ordinary ague, the heat being intense from the outset. Vomiting and\r\nbilious stools occurred plentifully to most, with sweat succeeding, not\r\nhowever an easy, uninterrupted and critical sweat. The remission of the\r\nfever fit was rarely complete in the intermediate day, weakness, languor,\r\nthirst and restlessness always remaining. In some the type improved after\r\nthree or four of these quasi-tertian paroxysms; the later fits were\r\nushered in with a rigor and a cold stage, so that the fever became an\r\nexact tertian intermittent. But in most the type became worse, which may\r\nhave been due to errors of regimen and physicking. The fever became,\r\nindeed, a continued one, and might end in nervous symptoms--lethargy,\r\ndelirium, cramps or convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn August it was spreading far and near, so that in every region or\r\nvillage round Oxford, many were sick of it; but it was much more frequent\r\nin the country cottages and in the smaller villages than in cities or\r\ntowns. It was called “the new disease,” as the war-typhus of 1643 had been\r\ncalled, and other epidemics both earlier and later.\r\n\r\nWillis continues: It crept from house to house, infecting most of the same\r\nfamily, and especially those in familiar converse with the sick. “Yea old\r\nmen, and men of ripe age, it ordinarily took away.” It lasted many days in\r\nan individual, nay even months, attended with much evacuation and almost\r\ndaily vomits and sweats. “Scarce one in a thousand died of it, which I\r\nnever knew in an epidemical synochus.” This singular malady, which\r\ndiffered from ague not only in its want of clear intervals between the\r\nfits of fever, but also in being propagated by contagion, raged throughout\r\nall England in the autumn of 1657. Only in some few limited localities,\r\nand in these only in some cases, was it accompanied by true dysentery.\r\nWillis is not satisfied with the facile explanation of an infection of the\r\nair, “the little bodies of which infections, being admitted within, did\r\nferment with the blood and humours.” There must have been something\r\nequally general in the human body, a predisposition to be so acted upon;\r\nand of that proneness to fever he finds the cause in the intemperance of\r\nthe year, namely the great heat of the summer and autumn.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable illustration of these doctrines was the epidemic\r\nof the following spring, which was a pure and unmistakeable epidemic of\r\ninfluenza-cold. After the very hot summer and autumn, there was a long\r\nwinter of intense frost. From the ides of December to the vernal equinox\r\nthe earth was covered with snow, the wind blowing steadily from the north.\r\nThe state of health through the winter was fairly good. The north wind\r\ncontinued until June. “About the middle of April, suddenly a distemper\r\narose as if sent by some blast of the stars, which laid hold of very many\r\ntogether; and in some towns in the space of a week above a thousand fell\r\nsick together.” They had a troublesome cough, great spitting, and catarrh\r\n“falling down on the palate, throat, and nostrils.” The illness approached\r\nwith fever, thirst, want of appetite, weariness, grievous pains in the\r\nhead, back, loins and limbs, and heat in the praecordia. Some were very\r\nill in bed, with hoarseness and almost continual coughing; others had\r\nbleeding at the nose, bloody spittle or bloody flux. Not a few old and\r\ninfirm died, but the more strong, and almost all the healthy constitutions\r\nrecovered. Those that died “wasted leisurely,” like persons sick of a\r\nhectic fever. About the third part of mankind was distempered in a month.\r\nWillis’s explanation of it is that the constant north wind checked the\r\nnatural action of the blood in spring. The spring blood is more lively,\r\nlike the juices of vegetables. The catarrhal fever was a disorder of the\r\nspring blood, like new wine close shut up in bottles.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak about the middle of April is evidently described for Oxford\r\nand the country around. Willis then describes his third epidemic, that of\r\nthe summer and autumn of 1658, which was the same type of fever as in the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1657. The vernal fever of 1658 did not last longer\r\nthan six weeks. The wind continued still north, until the summer solstice;\r\na little before the beginning of July there was a most fierce heat for a\r\nfew days, and when the dog-days were begun, the air grew most cruelly hot,\r\nso that one could scarce endure it in the open. The new fever arose mostly\r\nabout the end of August, and began to spread through whole regions about\r\nus (at Oxford), and chiefly, like that of 1657, in country houses and\r\nvillages; but in the meantime few of the inhabitants of the greater towns\r\nand cities fell sick. The symptoms were much the same as in the previous\r\nautumn. The fever was continual in some; in others it was of an\r\nintermitting type at first; but very many were ill “in their brain and\r\nnervous stock,” with cruel headache, noises in the ears, dullness of\r\nhearing, stupor, vertigo, waking, and delirium. In some, on the first or\r\nsecond day, “little broad and red spots like to the measles have leisurely\r\nbroken forth in the whole body, which being shortly vanished, the fever\r\nand headache became worse.” The patients lay for a few days as if dying,\r\nwithout speaking or knowing their friends, after which came lethargy and\r\ndelirium. The young men mostly recovered, the old men died. In the fits of\r\nold men, the heat was not very sharp, but there were restlessness, tossing\r\nabout, idle and random talking, with dryness of the mouth, surfiness of\r\nthe tongue, and viscous sordes. Usually the pulse was strong and equal; a\r\nweak, unequal and intermittent pulse, with contractures of the tendons and\r\nconvulsive motions in the wrists, was an omen of death. Those who died\r\npassed away in a stupor, without consciousness to dispose of their goods;\r\nthe recovery of others was long and doubtful. One notable thing in this\r\nfever was the exanthem, which reminds one more of the rash of sweating\r\nsickness or dengue (breakbone fever), than of the spots of typhus.\r\n\r\nWillis ends his book on fevers with that account of the autumnal epidemic\r\nof 1658, “taken the 13th of September,” his work having been published at\r\nthe Hague in 1659. Whitmore, whose short essay is dated from London,\r\nNovember, 1659, begins with the autumnal epidemic of 1658, which is the\r\nlast of Willis’s three; and, strangely enough, he also has a vernal\r\nepidemic of influenza to describe--an epidemic clearly belonging to the\r\nspring of 1659. Unless there be some error in Whitmore’s dates, it is\r\nimpossible to avoid the conclusion that the second autumnal fever, that of\r\n1658, was followed by a spring influenza, just as the first, of 1657, had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nWhitmore’s account of the autumnal fever of 1658 agrees in the main with\r\nthat given by Willis. He defines it as “a putrid continued and malignant\r\nfever containing in it the seeds of contagion.” It raged in the last\r\nautumn through all England, “and now begins again,” (his preface being\r\ndated November, 1659), seizing on all sorts of people of different nature,\r\nwhich shows that it is epidemic. The part affected is chiefly the heart,\r\nand therefore some call it _cordis morbus_.\r\n\r\n    “In this, as in the plague at the first catching of it, some seem to\r\n    be very pleasant, so far are they from perceiving themselves to be\r\n    amiss, when indeed death itself hath set his foot within the threshold\r\n    of their earthly houses.” There were pains in the head, inclination to\r\n    vomit, sudden fainting of spirits, and weakness without any manifest\r\n    cause, the pulse feeble and sometimes intermittent, so as very lusty\r\n    and strong men in Cheshire (in the year 1651 where this disease then\r\n    raged) in a very short space so lost their strength that they were not\r\n    able to stand or turn themselves in their beds. Some also are taken\r\n    with bleeding, purging, and sweating, and many have the spots. But for\r\n    the most part it appears in the livery of some other kind of ague. It\r\n    begins to show its malignity after the 5th, 7th, or 9th day, with loss\r\n    of appetite, thirst, and a dry black tongue.\r\n\r\nLetters of 1658 from London bear out the prevalence of autumnal sickness.\r\nOn August 3, one writes that the weather is hot and dry, the town\r\nextremely empty, and the flux beginning. On January 4, 1659, there is much\r\nsickness, especially fevers, agues and the smallpox.\r\n\r\nA good deal of the interest of Whitmore’s essay lies in his arguments\r\nagainst blood letting in this fever; but that is part of a history which\r\nwill have to be dealt with as a whole at a later stage.\r\n\r\nWhitmore then proceeds to the vernal epidemic of 1659, just as Willis had\r\ndone to that of 1658. His words are (4 Nov. 1659):\r\n\r\n    “Having given an account of the nature and cure of this disease which\r\n    now rageth throughout England, I shall briefly describe that which\r\n    this spring universally infested London; and show how it agreed and\r\n    how it differed from that disease which last fall invaded the whole\r\n    nation.” He then describes the typical influenza, just as Willis had\r\n    done under a date a year earlier--pains in the limbs of some, coughs,\r\n    and aguish distempers in others; “so that in a week or a fortnight’s\r\n    time, when it had fermented and caused a putrefaction of humours, it\r\n    quickly tended to a height, and struck many thousands in London down,\r\n    scarce leaving a family where any store were, without some being ill\r\n    of this distemper, suddenly sweeping very many away, being the same,\r\n    in the judgment of no mean physician, with that in autumn last, though\r\n    in a new skin.” Whitmore then gives a reason “why this should hold\r\n    them all with coughs, which it did not in the fall.”\r\n\r\nAssuming an affinity to the autumnal epidemic of 1658, he proceeds to\r\nstate the circumstance of a reappearance in the spring of 1659: “Upon this\r\nhush it lay all the winter, until the Easter week, and then in two or\r\nthree warm days broke loose, having had no warm weather all before, but a\r\nrainy and black week, the sun not appearing for five or six days together\r\njust before the holiday; when on a sudden that warm weather breaking\r\nforth, the citizens in their summer pomp, being thinner clothed many of\r\nthem than before (like bees on a glorious day) swarmed abroad, and the\r\npores etc.”\r\n\r\nBoth Willis and Whitmore incline to the view that the catarrhal fever of\r\nthe spring was akin to the strange fever of the autumn, the differentia of\r\neach being appropriate to the season. Willis, however, keeps the two types\r\nmore apart than Whitmore. The latter speaks of both fevers as “this\r\nProtean-like distemper,” whose various shapes “render it such a hocus\r\npocus to the amazed and perplexed people, they being held after most\r\nstrange and diverse ways with it.” It is “so prodigious in its alterations\r\nthat it seems to outvie even Proteus himself.” Thus the strangest part of\r\nthese narratives is not the catarrhal influenza, which has so often\r\nreappeared as to be familiar, but the prevalence of anomalous fevers, in\r\nsome respects like intermittents without the clear interval between the\r\nfits, but in respect of contagion, spots, pains and other symptoms, like\r\ntyphus--a volatile typhus of the country and of the towns. Although this\r\nepidemiological phenomenon be a strange one, there is no reason to\r\nquestion the correctness of Willis’s observations, corroborated as they\r\nare by those of Whitmore. But there are, indeed, many more experiences of\r\nthe like kind in the years to follow, which fall without the limits of the\r\npresent volume. One only of these later observers need be mentioned here.\r\nThe third of the famous trio with Sydenham and Willis was Morton. He had a\r\nlong experience in London of fever and smallpox, which he made the subject\r\nof a book in 1692-4[1117]. His history goes as far back as\r\n1658--“_historia febris_ συνεχὴς _ab anno 1658 ad annum 1691_.” Of the\r\nyear 1658 he says the fever was everywhere through England and refers to\r\nWillis; the only facts of his own being that Oliver Cromwell and his\r\n(Morton’s) father were carried off by it in September of that year, that\r\nhe had it himself (aged 20) and was three months in recovering, and that\r\nthe whole household (in Suffolk) were infected. Cromwell’s attack came\r\nupon him at Hampton Court on August 21; but it was not the first sickness\r\nof the kind that he had suffered. He was only fifty-nine, but worn out\r\nwith many cares, and at that time distressed by the death of his favourite\r\ndaughter, Lady Claypole, under his roof on August 6, from some painful\r\ninternal female trouble. The Lord Protector’s fever was called a “bastard\r\ntertian,” which might have been a name for the fever described by Willis.\r\nHe was removed on the 24th August to Whitehall, where the air was thought\r\nto be more wholesome; and died between three and four in the afternoon of\r\nSeptember 3, the anniversary at once of “Dunbar field and Worcester’s\r\nlaureat wreath.”\r\n\r\nThis prevalence of fevers, Protean in their varying types, all over\r\nEngland in 1657-59 corresponds to the fever period of 1623-24. In each\r\ncase the fever was a minor plague, and in each case it was followed by a\r\nrevival of the plague proper, which had been dormant all over the country\r\nfor a dozen or fifteen years. The principal difference is that the\r\nfever-period of 1623-24 was followed by the plague in 1625, whereas the\r\nfever-period of 1657-59 was followed by several years not free from fever\r\nand then by the plague in 1665. It is clear that the fevers of 1657-59\r\nmade a great impression all over England, and were afterwards popularly\r\nspoken of as a warning of the Great Plague itself. In the parish register\r\nof Aldenham, Hertfordshire, there is inserted a poem on the Great Plague\r\nof 1665, which has the following verses[1118]:\r\n\r\n  “Seven years since a little plague God sent,\r\n   He shook his rod to move us to repent.\r\n   Not long before that time a dearth of corn\r\n   Was sent to us to see if we would turn.”\r\n\r\nIn Short’s abstracts of parish registers, the years preceding 1665 stand\r\nout as sickly in country districts, according to the following figures:\r\n\r\n         No. of      No. with    Baptisms    Burials\r\n         registers   sickness    in same     in same\r\n         examined\r\n\r\n  1657       98         36          991        1305\r\n  1658       96         33          704        1159\r\n  1659      101         29          553         825\r\n  1660      107         17          342         489\r\n  1661      182(?)      25          448         685\r\n  1662      105         20          376         504\r\n  1663      119         15          325         443\r\n  1664      118         12          328         364\r\n  1665      117         14          229         446\r\n\r\nPeriods as unhealthy as 1657-59 do not occur again until 1667-71, and\r\n1679-84.\r\n\r\nWillis says, of the autumnal epidemic of 1658: “But in the meantime few of\r\nthe inhabitants of the greater towns and cities fell sick.” That is\r\nconfirmed for London, in a letter of October 26, 1658: “A world of\r\nsickness in all countries round about London. London is now held the\r\nwholesomest place;” but on January 4, 1659: “There is much sickness in the\r\ntown, especially feavers, agues, and smallpox[1119].” In Short’s tables,\r\nthe registers of market towns bear the same traces of much sickness in\r\n1657 and 1658 as those of country parishes.\r\n\r\nA high mortality from fever and spotted fever continued in London every\r\nyear from 1658 to the year of the great plague. The largest number of\r\ndeaths from fever was in the year of the plague itself, when the bills of\r\nmortality returned them as 5257 (without much certainty, however, owing to\r\nthe confusion of the plague). The next highest figures had been in 1661,\r\nwhen the fever deaths were 3490. We get a glimpse of that epidemic from\r\nPepys; on August 16, 1661, he writes: “But it is such a sickly time both\r\nin the city and country everywhere (of a sort of fever) that never was\r\nheard of almost, unless it was in plague-time. Among others, the famous\r\nTom Fuller is dead of it, and Dr Nicholls [Nicholas], dean of St Paul’s,\r\nand my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.” On August 31 he enters\r\nin his diary: “The season very sickly everywhere of strange and fatal\r\nfevers.” The same diarist, on October 20, 1663, has an entry that the\r\nqueen is ill of a spotted fever and that “she is as full of spots as a\r\nleopard;” on the 24th the queen was in a good way to recovery.\r\n\r\nIt is at this period that Sydenham’s famous observations of the seasons\r\nand the public health in London begin. The autumnal intermittents, he\r\nsays, which had been prevalent some years before, came back in 1661 with\r\nnew strength, about the beginning of July, being mostly tertians of a bad\r\ntype: they increased so much in August as to sweep away families almost\r\nentirely, but declined with the winter cold coming on. He then draws the\r\ndistinction between them and ordinary tertians. In the same years,\r\n1661-2-3-4, a continued fever is described at great length, and then he\r\ncomes to the “pestilential fever” and the plague itself of 1665 and\r\n1666[1120]. Taking from Sydenham the single fact, for the present, that\r\nan unusual amount of pestilential fever led up to the plague of 1665\r\n(which he did not stay in London to witness), we shall proceed in the next\r\nchapter but one to that crowning epidemic of the present section of our\r\nhistory. Something more remains to be said of the fevers of 1661\r\n(specially described by Willis as a fever of the brain and nervous stock,\r\nbut called “the new disease” in its turn); but as it is the first of\r\nSydenham’s “epidemic constitutions,” and as these are recorded\r\ncontinuously to 1685, when there was another “new fever,” it will be\r\nconvenient to end the detailed history of fevers for the present with the\r\nremarkable epidemics of 1657-59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSICKNESSES OF VOYAGES AND COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sea Scurvy, Flux, Fever, and Yellow Fever.)\r\n\r\nThe sicknesses of the first voyages and foreign settlements come into the\r\nhistory of national maladies, both as concerning Britain on the sea and\r\nbeyond sea, and as showing forth the disease-producing conditions of those\r\nearly times. In the latter respect there is more to be learned from\r\nvoyages and colonial experience than the records of domestic life at home\r\nare likely to inform us of otherwise than vaguely. The Englishman of the\r\ntime carried his habits with him to sea and to foreign parts, where the\r\ncircumstances were more trying and the consequences more obvious.\r\n\r\nThis history divides itself at once into several branches. There are the\r\ndisease-incidents of ocean voyages, irregular at first but becoming\r\nsomewhat uniform after the East India Company’s start in 1601, chief among\r\nthem being scurvy. There are next the early discouragements from sickness,\r\nboth on the voyage and after landing, in the planting of colonies in\r\nVirginia, New England and the West Indies, among which the troubles of\r\nJamaica were on a sufficiently great scale to deserve minute study.\r\nLastly, among the larger sections of this chapter, we have to notice the\r\nbeginnings and circumstances of the terrible and long-enduring scourge of\r\nWest Indian colonies--yellow fever. While we are mainly, in this record of\r\nthe sicknesses of voyages and of new colonies, concerned with British\r\nenterprise, we shall have occasion to glance at the similar experiences of\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first accounts of Sea Scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe malady that figures most in the narratives of the long ocean voyages\r\nwhich began with the modern period is scurvy. In the very first of the\r\ngreat voyages, that of Vasco de Gama to the Indies by the Cape of Good\r\nHope in 1498, scurvy appeared when the ships were on the West African\r\ncoast, fifty-five deaths occurring within a short period. Of all the known\r\nsubsequent occurrences of the kind, there are accounts more or less full\r\nin the collections of Hakluyt and Purchas, from which the facts in the\r\nsequel have been taken.\r\n\r\nIn the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan to the Pacific, scurvy is mentioned\r\nfirst at a late stage; in the year 1520 the ships had passed the straits\r\ncalled by his name and had been three months and twelve days sailing\r\nwestwards from the last land; their provisions had run short, and, “by\r\nreason of this famine and unclean feeding, some of their gums grew so over\r\ntheir teeth that they died miserably for hunger.” Nineteen men, as well as\r\na giant from Patagonia and an Indian from Brazil, were dead, and some\r\ntwenty-five or thirty others were sick, “so that there was in a manner\r\nnone without some disease[1121].”\r\n\r\nThere were no voyages of the same length by English ships until many years\r\nafter: and then we find the same troubles in them from scurvy and other\r\nsickness. While the Portuguese and Spaniards were navigating in tropical\r\nwaters, the English and French were sending most of their expeditions to\r\nthe North. The French attempted to found a colony on the shores of the\r\nGulf of St Lawrence, while the English sought to establish a trade with\r\nMuscovy by way of the White Sea, and to open a nearer route to the far\r\nEast by way of the polar regions. The voyages in all these enterprises\r\nwere short, the ships for the most part returning after an absence of four\r\nor five months, and without any notable experience of sickness: it was\r\nonly when the French wintered in Canada that scurvy broke out. Thus the\r\nEnglish voyages for the Muscovy Company have little or no interest for our\r\nsubject; while the three voyages of Frobisher in search of the North-West\r\npassage in 1576, 1577, and 1578, and the three of Davis in 1585, 1586, and\r\n1587 (in which last he got to 73° N.) are as nearly as possible free from\r\nrecords of sickness.\r\n\r\nJacques Cartier’s second expedition to the St Lawrence in 1535 had a\r\ndisastrous experience of scurvy. In his first voyage in 1534, with two\r\nships of sixty tons each and each carrying sixty-one men, he appears to\r\nhave had no sickness, having left St Malo on April 20, traded with the\r\nIndians on the Gulf of St Lawrence, and returned on September 5 of the\r\nsame year. The expedition of the following year, with three ships,\r\nwintered on the coast, amidst heavy ice, and about mid-winter began to\r\nsuffer from scurvy[1122]. The crews appear to have had no lack of stores,\r\nboth meat and drink, and the outbreak of scurvy, described as an unknown\r\ndisease, was so surprising that it was traced to infection from the\r\nIndians, who are said to have admitted the deaths of some fifty of their\r\nnumber from “pestilence.”\r\n\r\n    “The said unknown sickness began to spread itself amongst us after the\r\n    strangest sort that ever was either heard of or seen, insomuch as some\r\n    did lose all their strength, and could not stand on their feet; then\r\n    did their legs swell, their sinewes shrink as black as any coal.\r\n    Others also had their skins spotted with spots of blood of a purple\r\n    colour; then did it ascend to their ankles, knees, thighs, shoulders,\r\n    arms, and neck; their mouth became stinking, their gums so rotten that\r\n    all the flesh did fall off even to the roots of the teeth, which did\r\n    also almost all fall out. With such infection did this sickness spread\r\n    itself in our three ships that about the middle of February, of a\r\n    hundred and ten persons that we were, there were not ten whole; so\r\n    that one could not help the other.... There were already 8 dead and\r\n    more than 50 sick, and, as we thought, past all recovery.” The body of\r\n    one dead, aged 22, was opened to see what the disease was; he was\r\n    found to have his heart white, but rotten, and more than a quart of\r\n    red water about it[1123]; his liver was indifferent fair; but his\r\n    lungs black and mortified ... his milt toward the back was somewhat\r\n    perished, rough as if it had been rubbed against a stone.\r\n\r\n    “From the midst of November to the midst of March there died 25 of our\r\n    best and chiefest men, and all the rest sick except three or four;\r\n    then it pleased God to cast his pitiful eye upon us, and sent us the\r\n    knowledge of remedie of our healths, and recovery.... The Captain,\r\n    walking upon the ice, asken of Domagaia [an Indian] how he had done to\r\n    heal himself; he answered that he had taken the juice and sap of the\r\n    leaves of a certain tree, and therewith had healed himself! for it was\r\n    a singular remedy against that disease.” The Indian’s advice was “to\r\n    take the bark and leaves and boil them together and to drink of the\r\n    said decoction every other day, and to put the dregs of it upon the\r\n    legs that is sick.”...\r\n\r\n    “It is thought to be the sassafras tree. After this medicine was found\r\n    and proved to be true there was such strife about it, who should be\r\n    first to take of it, that they were ready to kill one another, so that\r\n    a tree as big as any oak in France was spoiled and lopped bare, and\r\n    occupied all in five or six days, and it wrought so well that if all\r\n    the physicians of Montpelier and Lovaine had been there with all the\r\n    drugs of Alexandria, they would not have done so much in one year as\r\n    that tree did in six days, for it did so prevail that as many as used\r\n    of it, by the grace of God recovered their health.”\r\n\r\nIn 1542, while Cartier was still trading on his own account to the St\r\nLawrence from Brittany, a more ambitious project, under a Crown patent,\r\nissued from La Rochelle[1124]. With De la Roche, count of Roberval, as\r\ngovernor, a number of adventurous nobles and gentry, with men, women and\r\nchildren to the number of two hundred in all, sailed in three ships, and\r\nestablished themselves in Lower Canada with all the formalities of\r\noccupation. Two of the three ships were sent home in September, the\r\ncolonists proper being left to taste the rigours of a Canadian winter: “In\r\nthe end many of our people fell sick of a certain disease in their legges,\r\nreynes and stomacke, so that they seemed to bee deprived of all their\r\nlymmes: and there died about fiftie.”\r\n\r\nThe first English records of scurvy at sea are in connexion with the early\r\nvoyages to Guinea for gold-dust[1125]. Mr John Lok sailed on the second\r\nvoyage to Guinea, on October 11, 1554, his ships being the ‘Trinitie,’ 140\r\ntons, the ‘Bartholomew,’ 90 tons, and the ‘John Evangelist,’ 140 tons.\r\nAfter trading some months on the African coast the ships sailed for home:\r\n“There died of our men at this last voyage about twenty and four, whereof\r\nmany died at their return into the clime of the cold regions, as between\r\nthe islands of Azores and England.” The disease is not named; but it is\r\nprobable from what follows that it was scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe next voyage to Guinea was Towrson’s first, in October 1555, from\r\nNewport, Isle of Wight, in the ‘Hart’ and the ‘Hind;’ the death of only\r\none man is mentioned; he died “in his sleep” on March 29; by the 7th May,\r\nthe provisions were so reduced that the ships put in on the coast of\r\nIreland to purchase milk and two sheep from the wild kernes, paying in\r\ngold-dust.\r\n\r\nIn Towrson’s second voyage there is no word of sickness; but in his third\r\nvoyage in 1577, it is a prominent topic of the narrative. The vessels\r\n‘Minion,’ ‘Christopher’ and ‘Tiger’ left Plymouth on January 30, 1577. On\r\nthe 8th of May, “all our cloth in the ‘Minion’ being sold, I called the\r\ncompany together to know whether they would tarry the sale of the cloth\r\ntaken in the prize at this place or no: they answered that in respect of\r\nthe death of some of their men, and the present sickness of 20 more, they\r\nwould not tarry, but repair to the other ships, of whom they had heard\r\nnothing since April 27.” Having at length bartered for gold until the\r\nnatives would barter no longer, the three ships bore up for home. On July\r\n24 the master of the ‘Tiger’ came aboard the ‘Minion’ and reported that\r\n“his men were so weak and the ship so leak that he was not able to keep\r\nher above the water.” A muster held of all the three crews the same day\r\nshowed that there were not above 30 sound men in them. On September 3,\r\nthere being only six men in the ‘Tiger’ who could work, the gold and\r\nstores were taken out of her, and she was abandoned. On October 6, when\r\noff the coast of Portugal, the ‘Christopher’ reported herself so weak that\r\nshe was not able to keep the sea. The ‘Minion’ promised to attend her into\r\nVigo; but a fair wind springing up, she signalled that she was off for\r\nhome, whereupon the ‘Christopher’ followed. On October 16, a great\r\nsouth-westerly storm arose; the men in the ‘Minion’ were not able, from\r\nweakness, to handle the sails, which were blown away: however, they made\r\nshift to reach the Isle of Wight on October 20, nothing more being said of\r\nthe ‘Christopher.’\r\n\r\nThe English voyages to Guinea for gold-dust were shortly followed by the\r\nthree expeditions of John Hawkins in 1562, 1564 and 1567 to the West coast\r\nof Africa for negro slaves to be sold to the Spaniards in Hispaniola and\r\nCuba and on the Spanish Main[1126]. Only a brief summary remains of the\r\nfirst voyage, in which nothing is said of sickness; in the second, the\r\nnegroes, at least, appear to have suffered on the somewhat long passage\r\nacross the tropical belt, especially from want of water; and the third was\r\nso calamitous in various ways that Hawkins himself wrote of it: “If all\r\nthe miseries and troublesome affairs of this sorrowful voyage should be\r\nperfectly and thoroughly written, there should need a painful man with his\r\npen, and as great a time as he had that wrote the lives and deaths of the\r\nmartyrs.” Little or nothing is said of one class of martyrs in the\r\nbusiness--the negroes, of whom the ships carried four to five hundred.\r\nEnglish lives were lost in the kidnapping raids, from poisoned arrows, it\r\nwas thought, the wounded dying “in strange sort with their mouths shut\r\nsome ten days before they died, and after their wounds were whole.” It was\r\non the return from the Gulf of Mexico, more than a year out from England,\r\nthat the sickness on board was worst. They cleared the Bahamas channel on\r\nNovember 16, 1568, after which, “growing near to the cold country, our men\r\nbeing oppressed with famine, died continually, and they that were left\r\ngrew into such weakness that we were scarcely able to manage our ship”\r\n(the ‘Jesus’ of Lubeck, 700 tons). They put in at Ponte Vedra, near Vigo,\r\non December 31, but the fresh provisions that they got turned to their\r\nhurt: “our men with excess of fresh meat grew into miserable diseases and\r\ndied a great part of them.” Twelve fresh hands shipped at Vigo enabled the\r\nvessels to reach the nearest English haven at Mount’s Bay in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we obtain some glimpses of seafaring among the Portuguese, who\r\nhad now in the middle of the 16th century a regular trade to the Indies,\r\nestablished by Vasco de Gama’s route round the Cape of Good Hope. Perhaps\r\nthe most famous of these records is that of the voyage of St Francis\r\nXavier from Lisbon to Goa in the spring of 1540. The expedition with which\r\nhe took passage carried, it is said, a regiment of a thousand men to\r\nreinforce the garrison of Goa; during the voyage the Jesuit apostle\r\n“rendered to the diseased services too revolting to be described, and\r\nlived among the dying and the profligate, the unwearied minister of\r\nconsolation and of peace[1127].” After five months the ships arrived at\r\nMozambique, by which time Xavier and many more were suffering from fever.\r\nGoa was not reached until thirteen months out from the Tagus. A more\r\nfamiliar narrative of the same voyage of the Portuguese ships a generation\r\nlater is given by an English youth, Thomas Stevens, in a letter written\r\nhome to his father, a citizen of London, shortly after arriving at Goa.\r\nBoth in its generalities and in its particulars this excellent letter will\r\nserve to measure the prevalence of scurvy, flux, and fever in the earlier\r\nperiod of the East Indian trade by the Cape[1128].\r\n\r\n    The five ships left Lisbon on April 5, 1579, the solemnity being\r\n    marked by the firing of ordnance and the braying of trumpets. In the\r\n    ships, “besides shipmen and soldiers, there were a great number of\r\n    children, which in the seas bear out better than men; and no marvel,\r\n    when that many women also pass very well.” After a passage along the\r\n    Guinea coast, made tedious by calms and head winds, they rounded the\r\n    Cape of Good Hope on July 29. From that point in the voyage the\r\n    Portugal ships were wont to follow one or other of two routes\r\n    according to the lateness of the season--either the route by the\r\n    Mozambique Channel, in which case they were able to get fruits and\r\n    fresh provisions, or the route along more southern parallels for a\r\n    time, and passing to the east of Madagascar[1129]. In the latter case,\r\n    “by reason of the long navigation and want of food and water, they\r\n    fall into sundry diseases, their gums wax great and swell, and they\r\n    are fain to cut them away, their legs swell, and all the body\r\n    becometh sore and so benumbed that they cannot stir hand nor foot, and\r\n    so they die for weakness. Others fall into fluxes and agues, and so\r\n    die thereby.\r\n\r\n    “And this way it was our chance to make; and though we had more than\r\n    one hundred and fifty sick, there died not past seven-and-twenty,\r\n    which loss they esteemed not much in respect of other times.”\r\n\r\n    The ships went greatly out of their course, having sighted the island\r\n    of Socotra at the entrance to the Gulf of Aden, and did not arrive at\r\n    Goa until October 24, 202 days from Lisbon without calling anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first of the long English voyages beyond the Line was Sir Francis\r\nDrake’s famous circumnavigation from November 15, 1577, to September 26,\r\n1580[1130]. Drake must have lost many of his men in those three years, but\r\nthere is nothing in the narrative to show that they perished of disease.\r\nThe expedition was by way of the Straits of Magellan, and was mainly given\r\nup to plundering the Spaniards on the coasts of Chili and Peru. Drake set\r\nout for home loaded with treasure by way of the Philippines and the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. It is not until the narrative brings us to a small island\r\nbetween Ternate and Celebes that we hear of sickness; they graved the ship\r\nthere and remained twenty-six days, during which the “sickly, weak and\r\ndecayed” recovered their strength, a large species of crayfish found on\r\nthe island being “very good and restoring meat, whereof we had\r\nexperience.” But even Drake, with all his systematic care and resource,\r\nwas destined in after years to have a share of the common sickly\r\nexperience at sea, and to find disease a more potent enemy than the\r\nSpaniard.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarkable Epidemic in Drake’s Fleet 1585-6.\r\n\r\nDrake’s next great expedition after his circumnavigation was in 1585, with\r\nsix Queen’s ships and some nineteen others, carrying 2,300 men. A large\r\nnumber of private adventurers had a money interest in the enterprise,\r\nwhich had for its object to plunder Spanish towns in the West Indies and\r\nthe Spanish Main and to capture the treasure at the isthmus of Panama on\r\nits way to Spain. The fleet experienced one of the most remarkable\r\nepidemics in the whole history of sickness[1131].\r\n\r\n    Having left Plymouth on September 14, 1585, they arrived at the island\r\n    of St Jago, in the Cape de Verde group, on November 16. More than a\r\n    thousand men were landed, and were marched up the steep and broken\r\n    ground to a hill overlooking the capital, which stood in a narrow\r\n    valley, with high cliffs on the east and west and the Atlantic open\r\n    before it at some distance on the south. The place was surrounded by a\r\n    wall, and defended by fifty pieces of brass ordnance; but no\r\n    resistance was offered, and the English marched in to find the\r\n    inhabitants fled farther inland. On the 17th November, the town was\r\n    quartered out for the lodging of the whole army, which remained there\r\n    for ten days or a fortnight (there are inconsistent dates), taking\r\n    such spoils as the place yielded (wine, oil, meal and “trash” of the\r\n    Portuguese trade to the Indies). After a week, when no one had come to\r\n    ransom the town, Drake set out with 600 men to the village or town of\r\n    St Domingo, twelve miles inland, with the hope of finding the governor\r\n    and the bishop; but, finding no one, he marched his men back again the\r\n    same evening. On November 26 the whole force was re-embarked, all the\r\n    houses in the capital as well as in the country round were set fire\r\n    to, the port of Playa, a few miles to the westward, was also burned,\r\n    and on the same night the ships weighed anchor from the latter, and\r\n    stood away to the south-west. They had filled their water-casks from a\r\n    pool, near the seashore, formed by the small stream which runs through\r\n    the capital and descends the southern declivity. Nothing is said of\r\n    sickness during the occupation of St Jago; there seems to have been\r\n    some lax discipline, (owing to the mixed character of the expedition),\r\n    which Drake quickly remedied.\r\n\r\nThe ships were only eighteen days in crossing the Atlantic to Dominica, a\r\ndistance of some forty meridians. In the midst of that quick sailing along\r\nthe edge of the tropical belt of ocean, with the steady north-east trade\r\nwind behind them, the season the beginning of December and the climate the\r\nmost delightful and most refreshing on the globe, the ships were visited\r\nsuddenly with the fury of a deadly pestilential fever, of which the\r\nfollowing is the account by a captain of the land-forces on board:\r\n\r\n    “We were not many days at sea but there began among our people such\r\n    mortality as in a few days there were dead two or three hundred men.\r\n    And until some seven or eight days after our coming from St Jago\r\n    there had not died any one man of sickness in all the fleet. The\r\n    sickness showed not his infection wherewith so many were stroken until\r\n    we were departed thence; and then seized our people with extreme hot\r\n    burning and continual agues whereof very few escaped with life, and\r\n    yet those for the most part not without great alteration and decay of\r\n    their wits and strength for a long time after. In some that died were\r\n    plainly showed the small spots which are often found upon those that\r\n    be infected with the plague.”\r\n\r\nFrom Dominica the ships sailed to St Christopher, on which island Drake\r\ndisembarked his whole force, and cleaned and aired his ships, according to\r\nan excellent practice which he had followed also in his great\r\ncircumnavigation. Some days of Christmas having been thus spent ashore,\r\n“to refresh our sick people,” the voyage was resumed to Hispaniola. Deaths\r\ncontinued to occur, from the same disease as at first, both among officers\r\nand men, and so continued for many weeks. However, they were able to land\r\nsome 1000 or 1200 men on Hispaniola, and to carry the city of San Domingo\r\nby assault. The fleet then sailed southwards along the coast of the\r\nmainland to Cartagena, which was captured in turn, and in like manner held\r\nto ransom.\r\n\r\nIt is at this part of the narrative that we next hear of the infection in\r\nthe fleet:\r\n\r\n    “We stayed here six weeks [from middle of January to end of February,\r\n    1586], and the sickness with mortality, before spoken of, still\r\n    continued among us, though not with the same fury as at the first. And\r\n    such as were touched with the said sickness, escaping death, very few\r\n    or almost none could recover their strength; yea, many of them were\r\n    much decayed in their memory, insomuch that it was grown an ordinary\r\n    judgment, when one was heard to speak foolishly, to say he had been\r\n    sick of the _calentura_, which is the Spanish name of that burning\r\n    ague; for, as I told you before, it is a very burning and pestilent\r\n    ague.”\r\n\r\nThen follows the Spanish theory of the _calentura_, which may or may not\r\nbe rightly applied to the deadly epidemic that broke out suddenly in the\r\nEnglish ships in mid ocean:\r\n\r\n    “The original cause thereof is imputed to the evening or first night\r\n    air, which they term _la serena_, wherein they say, and hold very firm\r\n    opinion, that whoso is then abroad in the open air shall certainly be\r\n    infected to the death, not being of the Indian or natural race of\r\n    those country people. By holding their watch our men were thus\r\n    subjected to the infectious air, which at St Jago was most dangerous\r\n    and deadly of all other places. With the inconvenience of continual\r\n    mortality, we were forced to give over our intended enterprize, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe land-captains having been consulted by Drake, on February 27, 1586,\r\nadvised that the expedition should go home from Cartagena, instead of\r\nattempting to capture the treasure at Panama. In their memorandum they\r\nwrote: “And being further advised of the slenderness of our strength,\r\nwhereunto we be now reduced, as well in respect of the small number of\r\nable bodies, as also not a little in regard of the slack disposition of\r\nthe greater part of those which remain, very many of the better minds and\r\nmen being either consumed by death, or weakened by sickness and hurts,\r\netc.” The voyage to England was accordingly begun; St Augustine in Florida\r\nwas captured by the way, and the struggling colony in Virginia, the first\r\nsent out by Raleigh, was taken up and brought back, and Portsmouth reached\r\non July 28. “We lost some 750 men in the voyage, above three parts of them\r\nonly by sickness.” The names are given of eight captains, four\r\nlieutenants, and seven masters, who had died; and there were some other\r\nofficers dead unnamed. When the ransoms of San Domingo and Cartagena came\r\nto be divided, the venture must have been found as unprofitable to the\r\nshareholders as it had been disastrous to officers and men.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish name _calentura_, by which the fever in the fleet is\r\ndescribed, was probably used generically for various kinds of fever in the\r\ntropics. But of this fever in particular, we have some details not without\r\ndiagnostic value. It was doubtless contracted at St Jago in the Cape de\r\nVerde islands; it broke out suddenly in mid ocean after some seven or\r\neight days sailing before the wind, in a delightful climate, which points\r\nto the regular incubation of an infective virus, received by hundreds of\r\nmen when they were last ashore; the mortality was enormous; the symptoms\r\nwere those of a burning fever; and in some cases there were small spots or\r\npetechiae like those often seen in the plague. It was clearly a febrile\r\nform of pestilential infection, and, as few recovered, it must be\r\nconsidered to have had a death-rate such as typhus has rarely had, and\r\nsuch as yellow fever has commonly had. Nothing is said of the black\r\nvomit, the haemorrhages, and the saffron colour of skin and eyes, which\r\nare distinctive of yellow fever[1132]. On the other hand there is a\r\nremarkable after-effect mentioned in both the passages quoted, the loss of\r\nmemory, impairment of wits, and appearance of foolishness, which made “the\r\ncalenture” a bye-word in the fleet. I shall not venture to say what the\r\ninfection was; but it seems tolerably certain that it was contracted by\r\nthe English during their occupation of the capital town of St Jago. More\r\nrecent visitors to the Cape de Verde islands have remarked upon their\r\ntowns and villages as fever-traps, and have pointed to the source of the\r\nfever; it is not malaria, or the mere climatic influence, but a\r\npestilential emanation from spots of soil long inhabited by mankind, both\r\nblack and white, and so situated in cups of the hills as to retain and\r\nmultiply the filth-ferment in them. According to all analogy, the\r\nemanations from such a soil would be felt most by strangers not inured to\r\nthem, and most of all by men of another stock and from other\r\nlatitudes[1133].\r\n\r\n\r\nSicknesses of Voyages, continued: Management of Scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Virginia which returned in 1586 with Drake’s ships\r\nhomeward bound from the Spanish Main, was the first sent out by Raleigh\r\nwith the intention of settling, an earlier voyage in 1584 having been made\r\nto explore the country. It is in connexion with Raleigh’s second colony\r\n(and fourth expedition) in 1587 that we hear of disastrous sickness[1134].\r\nHaving left 118 people to inhabit the country, the two larger ships sailed\r\nfor home on August 27 of the same year. On board the “fly-boat,” the\r\nprovisions fell short, the water turned stinking, officers and men died,\r\nand the vessel was navigated with difficulty to the west coast of Ireland.\r\nWhen they reached Portsmouth, they found the admiral arrived there three\r\nweeks before them, but with an equally disastrous experience: “Ferdinando\r\nthe master, with all his company were not only come home without any\r\npurchase, but also in such weakness by sickness of their chiefest men that\r\nthey were scarce able to bring their ship into harbour, but were forced to\r\nlet fall anchor without.”\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1588, was made memorable in the English annals of the\r\nsea by the defeat of the Spanish Armada. There was much sickness in both\r\nfleets. As regards the English ships, a writer who has had special access\r\nto original documents says[1135]:\r\n\r\n    “We little think, when we peruse the melancholy tale of disease,\r\n    starvation and shame, so needlessly undergone by the heroic champions\r\n    of England’s liberty against the invading might of Spain, from what\r\n    obscure and insignificant causes the difficulties and hardships of the\r\n    Island seamen may have chiefly arisen”--namely the peculation of\r\n    officials, the mouldering rations, empty magazines, and the like. In\r\n    the ships of the Spanish fleet the infection was like that of the\r\n    plague itself; the main body of the expedition, fifty sail, reached\r\n    Corunna, Santander and St Sebastian with such infection among the ten\r\n    thousand men on board, that the inhabitants shut their houses against\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nTwo of the heroes of that fight, Drake and Hawkins, met their death by\r\nsickness off the Spanish Main in 1595-6. The expedition, consisting of\r\n2500 men in six Queen’s ships and twenty-one others, left Plymouth on\r\nAugust 28, 1595[1136]. Only the deaths of officers are mentioned in the\r\nnarrative, but of these there seem to have been a good many, when the\r\nships were in the Caribbean Sea. Hawkins died off Porto Rico on November\r\n12. On December 7, Mr Yorke, captain of the ‘Hope,’ died of sickness, on\r\nJanuary 15, captain Plat died of sickness, and then Sir Francis Drake\r\nbegan to keep his cabin and to complain of a scouring or flux: he died on\r\nJanuary 28, off Porto Bello. On the 27th died captain Jonas of the\r\n‘Delight,’ captain Egerton, and James Wood, chief surgeon of the fleet,\r\nout of the ‘Garland.’ On the 28th died Abraham Kendall out of the ‘Saker.’\r\nSeveral of the ships were sunk so that their men might go to the Queen’s\r\nships, which were short of hands. A muster on February 6 showed in the\r\nwhole fleet “two thousand sick and whole,” or five hundred fewer than had\r\nsailed. There was some loss of life in encounters with the enemy, but much\r\nmore from disease.\r\n\r\nOf the filibustering cruises or expeditions to the East by the South\r\nAmerican route, there remain to be mentioned two by Thomas Cavendish, and\r\none at some length by Richard Hawkins, before we come to the establishment\r\nof regular English trade to the East Indies by the Portuguese route round\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. Cavendish’s first voyage[1137] by the Straits of\r\nMagellan was from Plymouth, 25 July, 1586, with three ships (240 tons in\r\nall) carrying 125 men.\r\n\r\n    Touching on the west coast of Africa, they went ashore and took lemons\r\n    from the trees. Off the coast of Brazil in November and December two\r\n    men died “of the disease called scorbuto, which is an infection of the\r\n    blood and the liver.” Arrived at the Straits of Magellan they found\r\n    twenty-three Spaniards living on shell-fish, “which were all that\r\n    remained of four hundred which were left there [to found a colony] in\r\n    these Straits of Magellan, three years before, all the rest being dead\r\n    with famine.” They were only too glad to hasten from this place, Port\r\n    Famine, “for the noysome stench and vile savour wherewith it was\r\n    infected through the contagon of the Spaniards’ pined and dead\r\n    carkeises.” In one of Cavendish’s own ships, on February 21, 1588,\r\n    when among the East Indian islands, Captain Havers died of “a most\r\n    severe and pestilent ague, which held him furiously some seven or\r\n    eight days. Moreover presently after his death, myself [Pretty, the\r\n    narrator] with divers others in the ship fell marvellously sick, and\r\n    so continued in very great pain for the space of three weeks or a\r\n    month, by reason of the extreme heat and intemperature of the\r\n    climate.”\r\n\r\nOne might guess that these were cases of ship-fever (or calenture); but in\r\nCavendish’s last voyage we meet with a strange sickness which will perhaps\r\nbaffle all nosological conjecture. This voyage, like the first, was\r\nintended for the East Indies by way of the Straits of Magellan[1138]. The\r\nthree tall ships and two barks, having sailed from Plymouth on August 26,\r\n1591, never got through the Straits; they were still within their recesses\r\nin April, 1592, many men having “died with cursed famine and miserable\r\ncold,” and sick men having been put ashore into the woods in the snow. The\r\nnarrative (by John Lane), then follows the fortunes of one of the ships,\r\nthe ‘Desire.’ Landing at Port Desire, in Patagonia, they found\r\nscurvy-grass growing, which they ate with oil: “This herb did so purge the\r\nblood that it took away all kind of swellings, of which many [had] died,\r\nand restored us to perfect health of body, so that we were in as good\r\ncase as when we came first out of England.” There also they took on board\r\n14,000 penguins, which they had dried on the rocks, mostly without salt;\r\nand sailed northwards on December 22. With only 27 men surviving out of\r\n76, they left the coast of Brazil at Cape Frio (near Rio de Janeiro), and\r\nthen began their more singular experience of disease.\r\n\r\n    “After we came near unto the sun, our dried penguins began to corrupt,\r\n    and there bred in them a most loathsome and ugly worm of an inch long.\r\n    This worm did mightily increase, and devour our victuals;” it devoured\r\n    everything except iron,--clothes, boots, shirts, even the ship’s\r\n    timbers! “In this woeful case, after we had passed the equinoctial\r\n    toward the North, our men began to fall sick of such a monstrous\r\n    disease as I think the like was never heard of: for in their ankles it\r\n    began to swell, from thence in two days it would be in their breasts,\r\n    so that they could not draw their breath, and then fell into their\r\n    cods, and their cods and yardes did swell most grievously and most\r\n    dreadfully to behold, so that they could neither stand, lie, nor goe.\r\n    Whereupon our men grew mad with grief. Our captain [John Davis] with\r\n    extreme anguish of his soul was in such woeful case that he desired\r\n    only a speedy end, and though he were scarce able to speak for sorrow,\r\n    yet he persuaded them to patience.... For all this, divers grew raging\r\n    mad, and some died in most loathsome and furious pain. It were\r\n    incredible to write our misery as it was; there was no man in perfect\r\n    health but the captain, and one boy.... To be short, all our men died\r\n    except sixteen [i.e., eleven died of the survivors after Cape Frio] of\r\n    which there were but five able to move.” Those five worked the ship\r\n    into Berehaven (Bantry Bay) on June 11, 1593, and there ran her\r\n    ashore.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable epidemic on board the ‘Desire,’ among men living upon dried\r\npenguin infested with worms, was probably not scurvy, or at least not all\r\nscurvy: the dropsy and dyspnœa suggest one of the two forms of beri-beri,\r\nof a peculiarly severe type. The co-existence of worms in the dried food\r\nmay lead one to think of a parasitic malady such as that caused by\r\nAnchylostoma duodenale, which has also an anasarcous or œdematous\r\ncharacter. But the diagnosis of beri-beri appears to be far more likely.\r\nThat epidemic, however we interpret it, must rank among the curiosities of\r\nthe history. But, in the next that we come to, the sickness on board the\r\n‘Daintie,’ Richard Hawkins master, on a voyage in 1593 through the Straits\r\nof Magellan, the disease is typical scurvy; and the observations on\r\nsea-scurvy by Hawkins himself are among the best that we have for the\r\nperiod, and, indeed, until long after the Elizabethan period[1139].\r\n\r\nThe ‘Daintie,’ a nearly new ship of 300 to 400 tons, weighed anchor from\r\nBlackwall on April 8, 1593. She was deeply laden with merchandise for\r\ntrade and accompanied by a victualler, of 100 tons, the ‘Hawk.’ It was not\r\nuntil June 12, that they got away from Plymouth. They put in at the Cape\r\nde Verde islands, about whose climate and health Hawkins makes some\r\nobservations already quoted. Sailing thence they had come within three or\r\nfour degrees of the Line, when scurvy broke out:\r\n\r\n    “My company within a few days began to fall sick of a disease which\r\n    seamen are wont to call the scurvie; and seemeth to be a kind of\r\n    dropsie, and raigneth most in this climate of any that I have heard or\r\n    read of in the world, though [it is found] in all seas. It possesseth\r\n    all those of which it takes hold with a loathsome sloathfulnesse,\r\n    _that even to eate_ they would be content to change _with sleepe and\r\n    rest_, which is the most pernicious enemie in this sickness that is\r\n    known. It bringeth with it a great desire to drink, and causeth a\r\n    general swelling of all parts of the body, especially of the legs, and\r\n    gums; and many times the teeth fall out of the jaws without pain. The\r\n    signs to know this disease in the beginning are divers,--by the\r\n    swelling of the gums, by denting of the flesh of the legs with a man’s\r\n    finger, the pit remaining without filling up in a good space; others\r\n    show it with their laziness; others complain of the crick of the back,\r\n    etc., all which are for the most part certain tokens of the infection.\r\n    The cause is thought to be the stomack’s feebleness by change of air\r\n    in intemperate climates, of diet in salt meats, boiled also in salt\r\n    water, and corrupted sometimes; the want of exercise, also, either in\r\n    persons or elements, as in calms.”\r\n\r\nHawkins then recalls the experience of the Queen’s fleet in 1590, at the\r\nAzores, the ships being in calm weather for six months: “in which voyage,\r\ntowards the end thereof, many of every ship (saving the ‘Nonpereli’ which\r\nwas under my charge and had only one man sick in all the voyage) fell sick\r\nof this disease and began to die apace.”\r\n\r\nHawkins wrote out the account of his 1593 voyage some time after, and did\r\nnot print it until 1622; but it may be supposed that the views about\r\nscurvy therein expressed were the same that he held and acted upon in his\r\nearlier life[1140]. Thus his remarks upon the prevention and cure of\r\nscurvy, about to be given, may be taken to stand for the practical wisdom\r\nor sagacity of the Elizabethan period. The ship should be kept clean,\r\nvinegar should be sprinkled and tar burned. In hot latitudes salt meats\r\nshould be shunned, and especially salt fish. Salt water should not be used\r\nto dress the meat, nor to wash shirts in; nor should the men sleep in\r\ntheir wet clothes. The crews should be set to various exercises, and\r\nencouraged to various pastimes. At this point he seems to feel that he is\r\na layman giving medical advice, and interpolates:\r\n\r\n    “And I wish that some learned men would write of it, for it is the\r\n    plague of the sea and the spoil of mariners. Doubtless it would be a\r\n    work worthy of a worthy man, and most beneficial for our country, for\r\n    in twenty years (since I have used the sea) I dare take upon me to\r\n    give account of ten thousand men consumed with this disease.”\r\n\r\nThe learned man was forthcoming in due course, in the person of John\r\nWoodall, surgeon-general to the East India Company; and we shall see what\r\nhe made of it. Meanwhile, in default of professional guidance, we may hear\r\nHawkins himself:\r\n\r\n    “That which I have seen most fruitful for this sickness is sour\r\n    oranges and lemons, and a water called Dr Stevens his water, of which\r\n    I carried but little, and it took end quickly, but gave health to\r\n    those that used it. The oyle of vitry [vitriol] is beneficial--two\r\n    drops in a draught of water with a little sugar. But the principal of\r\n    all is the air of the land; for the sea is natural for fishes, and the\r\n    land for men. And the oftener a man can have his people to land, not\r\n    hindering his voyage, the better it is and the profitablest course he\r\n    can take to refresh them.”\r\n\r\nHawkins, as well as his contemporaries, as we shall see, knew what\r\nlime-juice could do for scurvy, and knew also the limit of its powers; it\r\nwas useful, as he had himself found; but much else was needed to ward off\r\nscurvy. After experience showed clearly enough that some commanders with\r\nthe same stores as others could carry their crews through a long voyage\r\nwithout scurvy; Hawkins himself, in the ‘Nonpareil’ in 1590, had only one\r\nman sick of it, while it was general in the fleet. In the voyage of 1593,\r\nfor all his knowledge and resource, he appears to have found circumstances\r\ntoo hard for him. His crew showed their bad habits while the ship lay at\r\nPlymouth; as in Lancaster’s experience two years before, the evil habits\r\nof sailors told upon their constitutions, so that they became an easy prey\r\nto monotonous living at sea. Scurvy broke out when they were within three\r\nor four degrees of the Line: “The sickness was fervent, every day there\r\ndied more or less.” The ship’s course was accordingly turned westward,\r\nalthough they were too far south to benefit by the north-east trade wind;\r\nand in the end of October they came to the coast of Brazil at Santos, four\r\nmonths and a half out from Plymouth. At Santos they obtained 200 or 300\r\noranges and lemons, and a few hens; there were so many men sick that there\r\nwere not above three or four oranges or lemons to a share: “Coming aboard\r\nof our ships there was great joy amongst my company, and many with the\r\nsight of the oranges and lemons seemed to recover heart.” It is the great\r\nand unknown virtue of that fruit, he says, to be a certain remedy for this\r\ninfirmity. The rest of the voyage possesses no special interest for us.\r\nThe scurvy had “wasted more than half of my people;” so that Hawkins took\r\nthe crew and provisions out of the ‘Hawk,’ and burned her. He left the\r\nBrazilian coast on December 18, passed the Straits of Magellan, and after\r\nsome filibustering on the Chilian and Peruvian coasts, was captured by a\r\nSpanish ship, and sent home to Spain to be ransomed.\r\n\r\nHawkins, it will have been remarked, was no bigoted “lime-juicer;”\r\nalthough he knew the virtues of anti-scorbutic acids, he had a correct\r\napprehension of the need of cleanliness, dry clothing, exercise,\r\namusements and discipline, and if he had understood the need of wind-sails\r\nfor the ventilation of ’tween-decks, he would have had as scientific a\r\ngrasp of the whole question as Blane had two centuries after. But in the\r\nend of the Tudor period, and in the Stuart period, with abounding\r\nenterprise and national expansion, there was little sense of the personal\r\nneed of breathing space, whether in ships or in houses. The number of\r\nsouls on board, in proportion to a ship’s tonnage, was twice or thrice as\r\ngreat as the Board of Trade now allows. It was not only in long voyages,\r\nor in the monotony of tropical calms, that scurvy was apt to invade a\r\ncrew. The following experience, on our own shores, is credible enough: In\r\n1611 Purchas was shown a letter from Newfoundland, giving an account of a\r\nwinter spent there, the writer taking credit to himself for the small\r\namount of scurvy among the men under him: in a company of 39 persons, only\r\nfour were wanting in the spring; but, by way of contrast, he recalls what\r\nhappened at home in the year 1600[1141]:\r\n\r\n    “One Richard Fletcher, that is master pilot here, and a director of\r\n    the fishing, reported unto me that he was one of the company,\r\n    consisting of forty persons, that went in a drumbler of Ipswich called\r\n    the ‘Amitie,’ to the north of Ireland about eleven years ago from\r\n    London in the late Queen’s service under the charge of one Captain\r\n    Fleming, and continued there the space of two years. In which time two\r\n    and thirty died of the scurvie, and that only eight of them returned\r\n    home, whereof the said Richard Fletcher was one ... notwithstanding\r\n    that there were to be had fresh victuals and many other helps, which\r\n    their country [Newfoundland] as yet hath not, but in good time may\r\n    have.”\r\n\r\nWe have not yet come to any deliverance of the faculty on the subject of\r\nscurvy; Hawkins appears to be giving merely his own experience and\r\nreflections. Beside these we may here place the contemporary observations\r\nand practice of the French laymen, which are expressly at variance on some\r\npoints with medical teaching. Some time previous to 1609, Marc Lescarbot\r\nwrote an account of ‘the voyage of M. de Monts into New France;’ the\r\nexpedition sailed from Havre in March, 1604. Their first winter in Canada\r\nis thus related[1142]:\r\n\r\n    In the meanwhile the cold and snows came upon them.... Many idle,\r\n    sluggish companions drank snow-water, not willing to take the pains to\r\n    cross the river. “Briefly, the unknown sicknesses like to those\r\n    described unto us by James Quartier in his relation, assailed us. For\r\n    remedies there was none to be found. In the meanwhile the poor sick\r\n    creatures did languish, pining away by little and little for want of\r\n    sweet meats, as milk or spoon meat for to sustain their stomachs,\r\n    which could not receive the hard meats, by reason of let, proceeding\r\n    from a rotten flesh which grew and overabounded within their mouths;\r\n    and when one thought to root it out, it did grow again in one night’s\r\n    space more abundantly than before.... There died of this sickness\r\n    thirty-six; and thirty-six or forty more that were stricken with it\r\n    recovered themselves by the help of the Spring, as soon as the\r\n    comfortable season appeared. But the deadly season for that sickness\r\n    is the end of January, the months of February and March, wherein most\r\n    commonly the sick do die, every one at his turn, according to the time\r\n    when they have begun to be sick; in such sort that he which began to\r\n    be ill in February and March may escape, but he that shall overhaste\r\n    himself, and betake him to his bed in December and January, he is in\r\n    danger to die in February and March, or the beginning of April.... M.\r\n    de Poutrincourt made a negro to be opened that died of that sickness\r\n    in our voyage, who was found to have the inward parts very sound\r\n    except the stomacke, that had wrinkles as though they were ulcerated.”\r\n\r\nThen follow Lescarbot’s views of the treatment and prevention of scurvy.\r\nAfter advising to avoid “cold” meats without juices, gross and corrupted,\r\nsalted, “smoaky,” musty, raw and of an evil scent, including dried fishes,\r\nhe proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “I would not, for all that, be so scrupulous as the physicians, which\r\n    do put in the number of gross and melancholy meats, beeve’s flesh,\r\n    bear’s, wild boar’s and hog’s flesh (they might as well add unto them\r\n    beaver’s flesh, which notwithstanding we have found very good), as\r\n    they do amongst fishes the tons [tunnies], dolphins, and all those\r\n    that carry lard; among the birds the hernes, ducks and all other\r\n    water-birds; for, in being an over-curious observator of these things,\r\n    one might fall into the danger of starving. They place yet among the\r\n    meats that are to be shunned, bisket[1143], beans and pulse, the often\r\n    using of milk, cheese, the gross and harsh wine and that which is too\r\n    small, white wine, and the use of vinegar”\r\n\r\n--just like our own great masters in prohibitory dietetics.\r\n\r\nLescarbot’s advice agrees on the whole with that of Sir R. Hawkins: the\r\nmen should be well shod and clothed, merriment should be encouraged, and\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n    “Good wine taken according to the necessity of nature, it is a\r\n    soveraigne preservative for all sickness, and particularly for this.\r\n    The young buds of herbs in the Spring time be also very soveraigne....\r\n    We have had some sick that have been (as it were) raised up from death\r\n    to life, for having eaten twice or thrice of a coolice made of a\r\n    cock.”\r\n\r\nIn the voyage of Sir Thomas Smith to Baffin’s Bay in 1616, the treatment\r\nof scurvy by vegetable juices is mentioned: “Next day, going ashore on a\r\nlittle island we found great abundance of scurvie grass, which we boiled\r\nin beer, and so drank thereof, using it also in sallet, with sorrel and\r\norpen, which here groweth in abundance; by means whereof, and the blessing\r\nof God, all our men within eight or nine days shall gain perfect health,\r\nand so continue till our arrival in England[1144].”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who appear to have had the most correct intuition\r\nof the teaching of the schools were the Red Indians. Lescarbot says that,\r\nin the treatment of scurvy, “they use sweating often.” Perhaps they had\r\nsome dim notion of the doctrine of peccant humours: at all events they\r\nclung to the alterative practice until long after that date, with a\r\ntenacity second only to that of the European faculty itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nScurvy in the East India Company’s Ships: Professional Treatment.\r\n\r\nUntil the end of the Tudor period, scurvy had been only an occasional\r\nincident of English voyages. But as soon as the regular trade to the East\r\nbegins, we find it a common experience.\r\n\r\nThe English voyages to the East Indies by the Cape route really began in\r\n1591, when Captain James Lancaster sailed first in command of ships\r\nbelonging to the Company of Merchant Adventurers; but it was not until\r\n1601 that he sailed again to the East Indies in command of the first ships\r\nof the East India Company, which had been formed the year before.\r\n\r\n    The three ships in 1591, the ‘Penelope,’ ‘Marchant Royal,’ and ‘Edward\r\n    Bonaventure,’ cleared from Plymouth on April 10[1145]. They crossed\r\n    the Line on June 6, by which time two men were dead and divers sick.\r\n    In the tropics so much rain fell that “we could not keep our men dry\r\n    three hours together, which was an occasion of the infection among\r\n    them, and their eating of salt victuals, with the lack of clothes to\r\n    shift them.” On this first voyage, Lancaster began the practice which\r\n    was generally followed when the East India trade in English ships\r\n    became established; before attempting to double the Cape of Good Hope,\r\n    he refreshed his crews, who were weak and sick in all three ships, by\r\n    a sojourn ashore at the Bay of Saldanha, a few leagues to the north of\r\n    Table Bay. The voyage had already lasted more than three months from\r\n    Plymouth, and about six weeks from the Line[1146].\r\n\r\n    At a muster on August 1, in the Bay of Saldanha, Lancaster found that\r\n    he had 198 men sound and whole, of whom he assigned 101 to the\r\n    ‘Penelope,’ and 97 to the ‘Edward Bonaventure,’ sending home 50 more\r\n    or less unfit men in the ‘Royal Merchant.’ Scurvy, he says, was the\r\n    disease:\r\n\r\n“Our soldiers, which have not been used to the sea, have best held out,\r\nbut our mariners dropt away, which in my judgment, proceedeth of their\r\nevil diet at home.” The voyage was continued to the East Indies, the next\r\nthat we hear of the state of health being at Penang in the beginning of\r\nJune 1592, or some fourteen months out. The men were then very sick and\r\nmany fallen; the sick were landed, and twenty-six died there, but not of\r\nscurvy, we may surmise. They had now left but thirty-three men and one\r\nboy, “of which not past twenty-two were found for labour and help.”\r\n\r\n    The two ships sailed for home from Point de Galle on December 8, 1592,\r\n    and reached St Helena on April 3, 1593; one man was sick of the\r\n    scurvy, and another had been suffering from the flux for nine months,\r\n    but on the island both shortly recovered their perfect health. Instead\r\n    of reaching England, the ships were carried to the West Indies, where,\r\n    after an attempt to navigate them northwards, they were wrecked, and\r\n    the small remnants of their crews dispersed.\r\n\r\nLancaster’s first voyage for the East India Company in 1601[1147] was\r\n“with foure tall shippes, to wit, the Dragon, the Hector, the Ascension,\r\nand Susan, and a victualler called the Guest.” The Company, founded in\r\n1600, began with a capital of £72,000, which was laid out in the purchase\r\nand outfit of the ships, and in loading them with merchandise. The crews\r\nwere as follow:\r\n\r\n  Dragon,      600 tons,      202 men.\r\n  Hector,      300   \"        108  \"\r\n  Ascension,   260   \"         82  \"\r\n  Susan,       ---   \"         88  \"\r\n                              ---\r\n                              480\r\n  Guest,       130 tons.\r\n\r\nFurther, “in every of the said ships, three merchants to succeed one the\r\nother, if any of them should be taken away by death”--a sufficient\r\nindication of the risks of foreign trade.\r\n\r\n    The ships, having loaded in the Thames, sailed from Dartmouth on April\r\n    18, 1601, and got clear of Tor Bay on the 22nd. On July 24, two months\r\n    from the Channel, they crossed the southern tropic. But they had been\r\n    so long under the Line that “many of our men fell sick.” On August 1,\r\n    in 30° S., they met the south-west wind, “to the great comfort of all\r\n    our people. For, by this time very many of our men were fallen sick of\r\n    the scurvy in all our ships, and, unless it were in the general’s ship\r\n    only, the others were so weak of men that they could hardly handle the\r\n    sails.” Headwinds again hindered their course, and “now the few whole\r\n    men we had began also to fall sick, so that our weakness of men was so\r\n    great that in some of the ships the merchants took their turn at the\r\n    helm and went into the top to take in the top sails, as the common\r\n    mariners did.” Lancaster at length made Saldanha Bay, where he had\r\n    landed to refresh his crews on his first voyage round the Cape ten\r\n    years before. The state of three of the ships “was such that they was\r\n    hardly able to let fall an anchor to save themselves withall;” but\r\n    “the general went aboard of them and carried good store of men, and\r\n    hoysed out their boats for them.... And the reason why the general’s\r\n    men stood better in health than the men of other ships was this: he\r\n    brought to sea with him certain bottles of the juice of lemons, which\r\n    he gave to each one as long as it would last, three spoonfuls every\r\n    morning fasting, not suffering them to eat anything after it till\r\n    noon. This juice worketh much the better if the partie keepe short\r\n    diet, and wholly refrain salt meat, which salt meat, and long being at\r\n    the sea, is the only cause of the breeding of this disease. By this\r\n    means the general cured many of his men and preserved the rest, so\r\n    that in this ship (having the double of men that was in the rest of\r\n    the ships) he had not so many sick, nor lost so many men as they did,\r\n    which was the mercie of God to us all.”\r\n\r\nAt Saldanha Bay they bartered with the natives for an abundant supply of\r\nfresh meat and other provisions, and in due time doubled the Cape of Good\r\nHope. On Christmas day, eight months out from England, they put in to\r\nAntongil Bay, on the east side of Madagascar. On landing they found a\r\nwriting on the rocks that five Dutch ships had sailed thence two months\r\nbefore, having “lost between 150 and 200 men while they roade in that\r\nplace.” The English had a similar experience in store for them: on board\r\nLancaster’s ship, the master’s mate, the preacher, the surgeon and some\r\nten others, died; and, in the vice-admiral’s ship, the master with other\r\ntwo. It was mostly the flux that they died of, brought on by the\r\ndrinking-water, or by the excessive wetness of the season, or by “going\r\nopen and cold in the stomacke, which our men would often do when they were\r\nhot” (Hawkins gives the latter reason for flux at the Cape de Verde\r\nislands).\r\n\r\nThe references to scurvy before reaching the Cape, and to dysentery in\r\nMadagascar, are all that is said of sickness in this first venture of the\r\nEast India Company. But in the accounts of the voyages which regularly\r\nfollowed we hear a great deal of the loss of men at the factories, or in\r\nthe country trade, or on the voyage home, as well as on the outward\r\nvoyage[1148]. The Directors in London were naturally well aware how\r\ngreatly their ventures were imperilled and their profits reduced by the\r\nenormous loss of men. Under their own eyes ships would arrive in the mouth\r\nof the Channel with crews so weakened that they had to be met at Scilly\r\nwith help to navigate them through the narrow seas to the Thames. By their\r\ncorrespondence from abroad, they were frequently hearing of artificers\r\ndying in their factories, of ships arriving out with so many men dead, and\r\nof other ships cast away, partly by stress of weather no doubt, but\r\nsometimes from inability of the crews to man them. Accordingly we find\r\nthat they were alive to the best means of preventing “flux, scurvy, and\r\nfever.” Lancaster, as we have seen, carried lime-juice on his first voyage\r\nfor the Company in 1601. In the Court minutes of August 13, 1607, the\r\nfollowing were ordered to be provided with expedition: “Lemon water,\r\n‘alligant’ from Alicante, a wine very fit for beverage and good against\r\nthe flux, and old corn, etc.” At the Court of Directors on December 10,\r\n1614, there was considered an “offer of Dr Burgis to present the Company\r\nwith an antidote against poison, scurvy, and other diseases to which\r\npeople are subject these long voyages: Sir Thomas Roe and Captain Keeling\r\nto confer with him and report their opinions.” Trial was also to be made\r\nof baking fresh bread at sea, with the grinding of corn, “an exercise fit\r\nto preserve men in health.” The offer of Dr Burgis was accepted; and on\r\nJanuary 26, 1615, the minutes of the Court mention “instructions in\r\nwriting, and boxes of such things as are to be used, for prevention of the\r\nflux, scurvy, and fever, prepared by Dr Burgis, to be delivered to each\r\nship; the cost, about £23, to be paid.” In the minutes of the Court,\r\nNovember 22, 1619, there is reference to another preventive of scurvy:\r\n“The fleet to be supplied with 15 tons of white wine, to be drunk at the\r\nLine, and the Cape, which is used by the Dutch to preserve men from\r\nscurvy, and will refresh the men and scour their maws, and open and cool\r\nas well as lemon water”--the latter having been in all probability\r\ndisliked or refused by the men. In 1624, “the death of mariners” is a\r\ntopic at the Court of Directors; again, on October 15, 1626, the Court\r\nconsiders of the great mortality from scurvy in the ‘Charles’ and ‘Hart,’\r\nhomeward bound, and how to prevent it. Some were of opinion that lemon\r\nwater was very good, but Mr Styles related that tamarind was the\r\nexcellentest thing. However, there had been plenty of tamarinds aboard the\r\nships; and on Lieutenant Hill being called in, he testified that the crews\r\nhad all got tamarind, but they were all debauched people.\r\n\r\nJohn Woodall, surgeon to St Bartholomew’s Hospital, was at this time\r\nsurgeon-general to the East India Company, having medical charge of their\r\ndockyard at Blackwall; his name appears in the Court minutes as early as\r\n1614. In 1617 he published his ‘Surgion’s Mate,’ “chiefly for the benefit\r\nof young sea-surgions imployed in the East India companies affairs,” and\r\ndedicated it to Sir Thomas Smith, himself a navigator, and then chairman\r\nof the Court of Directors. This practical manual is largely occupied with\r\nthe management of fractures, dislocations, amputations, and the like, a\r\npart of his subject wherein Woodall was thoroughly competent; but there\r\nappears also in the title, “the cure of the scurvie, the fluxes of the\r\nbelly, of the collica and iliaca passio, tenasmus and exitus ani, the\r\ncallenture.” The section on scurvy, twenty-six pages long, is the one that\r\nhere concerns us. This was what Sir Richard Hawkins had desired: “And I\r\nwish that some learned men would write of it, for it is the plague of the\r\nsea and the spoil of mariners.” Woodall begins by disclaiming learning: “A\r\nlearned treatise befits not my pen.” But, at all events, his was the voice\r\nof the faculty, and he plunges boldly into pathology in the very first\r\nlines: “Scurvy is a disease of the spleen, whereby it is sometimes wholly\r\nstopped” etc. Being a man of much good sense, Woodall quickly leaves that\r\nline of remark, for a time at least. He repeats all the familiar\r\nexperience of Hawkins, Lancaster, and the numerous captains of East\r\nIndiamen, with whom he must have conversed many times (it does not appear\r\nthat he had himself sailed). He mentions the great benefit to the crews\r\nfrom landing at the Cape, with the fresh air and food, scurvy being\r\nthereby cured “without much other help.” He enforces the need of changes\r\nof clothing, and other things in the regimen on board, just as Hawkins and\r\nothers were wont to do in practice. He is as clear on the virtues of\r\nlime-juice as Lancaster, and copies somewhat closely the practice of the\r\nlatter in 1601: “each morning two or three spoonfuls, and fast after it\r\ntwo hours”; his originality appearing in the rider, grateful to seamen:\r\n“and if you add one spoonful of aqua vitae thereto, to a cold stomach it\r\nis the better.” He mentions that a “good quantity of juice of lemons is\r\nsent in each ship out of England, by the great care of the merchants, and\r\nintended only for the relief of every poor man in his need.” The ship’s\r\nsurgeon is advised to lay in a store of fresh lemons and oranges where\r\nthey were to be had on the voyage, and of tamarinds at Bantam.\r\n\r\nSo far, Woodall merely sets down what every shipmaster knew as to the\r\nthings that bring on scurvy, the best regimen to keep it off, and the\r\nextraordinarily rapid curative effect of lime-juice and of change to land\r\nair and fresh food. But there was a certain professional doctrine of\r\nscurvy, and a treatment of it _secundum artem_, namely the wisdom of\r\nlearned men which Hawkins had called for; and we have now to see what\r\nthat was, according to Woodall. His pathology is that of “obstructions,”\r\na curious fancy of the learned[1149].\r\n\r\nThe spleen, said Woodall in his opening lines, is the chief seat of\r\nobstruction; but on resuming the pathology, he proceeds to obstructions\r\nalso of the liver and brain:\r\n\r\n    “But it is plain that this grief is a lazy foul disease with\r\n    obstructions of the liver, or spleen, or both; as also it appeareth\r\n    that the head is much diseased, and that there is great obstructions\r\n    in the brain, for that the eyes not only look evil coloured, but also\r\n    the gums putrefy, and the teeth grow loose, and all the sinewy parts\r\n    of the body bear their part in the disease, for the shrinking and\r\n    withering of the sinews, with the great pains the party hath,\r\n    declareth no less” (p. 180).\r\n\r\nThis theoretical pathology Woodall supports by an appeal to morbid\r\nanatomy:\r\n\r\n    “Also it is manifest that divers of those which have been opened after\r\n    death have had their livers utterly rotted”-others having their livers\r\n    much swollen, and the spleen swollen, others full of water, others\r\n    their lungs putrefied and stunk while they have lived, (which last may\r\n    have been an incorrect inference from the foul state of the mouth).\r\n\r\nSuch being the pathology of the disease, he comes next to the indications\r\nof cure; and these he takes from “a famous writer, Johannes Echthius.”\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n    1. The opening of obstructions.\r\n\r\n    2. The evacuating of offending humours.\r\n\r\n    3. The altering the property of the humours.\r\n\r\n    4. The comforting and corroborating the parts late diseased.\r\n\r\nThe order of treatment, _lege artis_, is accordingly as follows: the\r\nadministration of a clyster or clysters; the opening of a vein, if strong\r\n(“but beware of taking too much blood away at once”); next day after the\r\nbleeding, “if he can bear it,” give him pills of euphorbium or gamboge;\r\nand lastly, “if you see cause,” certain days after you have given of any\r\nof your former laxatives, you may give a sweat to the patient in his bed.\r\nThus the indications from the pathology would be fulfilled--opening of\r\nobstructions, evacuating of ill humours, and altering the property of the\r\nhumours. It should be said for Woodall that his practice was better than\r\nhis theory. Thus, he cautions the young dogmatists who sailed as surgeons\r\nin East Indiamen, not to carry their principles too far; he has heard that\r\nthey are somewhat fond of the lancet, and he cautions them not to take too\r\nmuch blood at sea, as excessive depletion “makes the disease worse;” he\r\ncautions them also as to the use of gamboge.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed with a few more illustrations of what the Company’s\r\nships were actually experiencing during the period that those questions\r\nwere before the Court of Directors[1150].\r\n\r\n    In the sixth voyage for the Company, under the command of Sir H.\r\n    Middleton, the captain of the ‘Darling’ and three of his merchants\r\n    died at Tecoa, and most of the men were ill. In the eighth voyage,\r\n    when homeward bound between the Cape and St Helena in the month of\r\n    June, many of the men fell ill with scurvy, and the ship had to come\r\n    in to Waterford instead of the Thames. A similar experience befell\r\n    Captain Thomas Best in the ‘Dragon’ and ‘Hosiander,’ carrying together\r\n    380 persons. Having left Gravesend on February 1, 1612, he completed\r\n    his trading in the Indies, and arrived in the Thames on June 15, 1614,\r\n    six months from Bantam. The scurvy in this voyage comes in towards the\r\n    end. On March 4, 1614, “I did set sail in the roade of Saldanha; yet\r\n    notwithstanding our short passage, having been from Santa Helena but\r\n    two monethes and nine days, the one half or more of our company are\r\n    laid up [on June 4] of the scurvie and two dead of it. Yet we had\r\n    plentie of victuals, as beef, bread, wine, rice, oil, vinegar, sugar;\r\n    and all these without allowance. Note that all our men that are sick\r\n    have taken their sickness since we fell with Flores and Corvo. For\r\n    since that time we have had it very cold, especially in two great\r\n    storms.... From the Cape of Good Hope to the islands of Flores and\r\n    Corvo I had not one man sick.” While in the Malay Archipelago they had\r\n    buried twenty-five men at one place.\r\n\r\n    On November 3, 1618, the Directors have letters from two of their\r\n    captains at the Cape, of July 6 and 7, with news of their arrival\r\n    there on June 26, and the loss or sickness of many men, partly through\r\n    the stinking beer, the tainted beef, the lack of fresh provisions at\r\n    the Cape, and the want of warm clothes. A letter of February 25, 1619,\r\n    announces the arrival of the ‘Peppercorn’ in Bantam roads: A great\r\n    many men had died in the ten-months’ voyage between England and\r\n    Bantam; putrefied beef and pork, “not man’s meat,” the chief cause of\r\n    sickness. When they arrived at Bantam, not six men able to work; the\r\n    whole fleet in the like distress. Twenty-five men in all dead or\r\n    drowned. A letter from Batavia, January 11, 1622, says the master of\r\n    the ‘Anne’ and 14 men of the fleet were dead: “so many men are\r\n    deceased that they have not enough to man all the ships now in the\r\n    roads.” The ‘Diamond’ sailed from England on October 8, 1621, and\r\n    after a “long and tedious voyage” arrived at Jacatra previous to\r\n    November 24, 1622: enclosed are the accounts of those men who have\r\n    died, and nine wills. Another letter from Batavia, sometime in 1623,\r\n    covers an “abstract of the men deceased in the ships.”\r\n\r\n    On March 28, 1624, the ‘Royal James,’ with five others, sailed from\r\n    the Downs; she called at Saldanha Bay, and arrived on or before\r\n    November 15, at Swally bar, Batavia; the bread had been very bad, the\r\n    water too little, the beef not fit for men; have enclosed the names of\r\n    those deceased. The ‘Jonas,’ also arrived out at Batavia on November\r\n    15, appears to have been one of the five others; she called at\r\n    Saldanha Bay on July 19; “the wholesomeness of the air and the herb\r\n    baths caused the most part of their sick men to recover in ten days\r\n    from the scurbeck.” In June, 1625, the ‘Anne’ had been at Mocha for\r\n    eight months in great distress, with most part of her men dead and the\r\n    ship ready to founder.\r\n\r\n    Writing on October 13, 1625, from Batavia to the East India Company in\r\n    London, Governor Hawley says that the ‘London’ had arrived out on\r\n    August 23, with loss of 36 men, and 80 sick. She reported the\r\n    ‘Discovery’ to have left the Cape for St Helena, having lost 21 men;\r\n    two other ships, the ‘Moon’ and ‘Ruby’ had their crews “in remarkable\r\n    health.” On September 14, the ‘Swallow’ arrived out, having lost only\r\n    3 men. Of 46 men shipped in the ‘Abigail’ out of England, all were\r\n    dead but 5, in her coasting voyages upon Sumatra. Most of the workmen\r\n    and soldiers sent in the ‘London’ had arrived; “but since, by\r\n    disorders, are dead, as are those in the ‘Swallow.’ The smiths are all\r\n    dead; of the armourers, only John Speed and a boy alive. Most other\r\n    workmen dead or incapable. This is not remissness of government, but\r\n    the newcomers, dreaming of nothing but sack and sugar-plums in India,\r\n    are with much difficulty brought to obedience.” A Dutch ship, the\r\n    ‘Leyden’ arrived out in 1626, with loss of 22 men, having been twelve\r\n    months on the passage.\r\n\r\n    In the end of October, 1628, the ‘Morris’ reached the mouth of the\r\n    Channel from Bantam, “which was most happily met with near Scilly by\r\n    Captain Bickly, who was sent out to relieve any ship from the Indies,\r\n    she being in a very weak state by reason of an infectious disease.”\r\n    She reached the Downs safely with two other East Indiamen; but having\r\n    been driven from her anchors in a great storm, was wrecked on the\r\n    coast of Holland previous to November 19. Next year, about October 28,\r\n    1629, the ‘Mary’ of the East India Company was reported to have put\r\n    into Scilly having lost most of her men by sickness. Therefore, Sir H.\r\n    Mervyn, of H.M.S. ‘Lyon,’ in the Downs, having got early word of the\r\n    ‘Mary’s’ distress, writes to E. Nicholas, to say that if the Company\r\n    desire a convoy for the ‘Mary’ from their lordships of the Admiralty,\r\n    “she being rich,” he (Mervyn) hopes that Nicholas will remember him.\r\n\r\nBut, although it was not unusual for ships to come home with crews\r\nweakened by scurvy, it was not invariable. The ‘William’ returned to\r\nEngland in 1628, as rich a ship as the Company ever had from the East\r\nIndies, with not a sick man in her, nor any dead on the way; her lading\r\nwas computed to be worth £170,000[1151].\r\n\r\nIn a despatch of February 6, 1626, Hawley gives an account of a truly\r\ndisastrous sickness in the factory and among the Company’s ships at\r\nBatavia during the previous year, which illustrates another risk than that\r\nof scurvy or flux, and an experience in the East Indies not altogether\r\nexceptional[1152].\r\n\r\n    “On March 12, I dispeeded the ‘Diamond’ for Japan to fetch boards,\r\n    planks, etc. [to repair the ‘Bull’ with]; but hardly had fourteen days\r\n    passed when the ‘Bull’s’ men fell sick and died daily; then the\r\n    ‘Reformation’s’ men died by five, six or more in a day; in a short\r\n    time the ‘Bull’s’ men all died but the master and one more, who were\r\n    dangerously sick, and in the ‘Reformation’ the master and all the men\r\n    lay at God’s mercy. We were forced to relieve them by blacks, and hale\r\n    the ships to the open bay [they would seem to have been careened]\r\n    where they rode like wrecks without other help than some few to\r\n    comfort their sick, for more from the other ships might not be spared.\r\n    The contagion was so pestilent that their blood, being licked by dog\r\n    or cat, caused them to swell, burst and die. It was more moderate on\r\n    shore, and was least on the ships in the open bay, though they also\r\n    were daily visited.... The ‘Diamond’ returned on April 11, with planks\r\n    etc.; also slaves and 44 Chinamen, which were with no small charge\r\n    procured, and who all fell sick, and 10 or 12 died.... Thinking the\r\n    mortality was occasioned, not by pestiferous air or soil, nor by any\r\n    noxious tree, but by surfeit and the wet monsoon, I enacted orders for\r\n    government building, and cleansing the trees to get more air. Wanted\r\n    no provisions of fresh victual; could at pleasure command neighbours\r\n    to fish and fetch anything needed, and the island itself furnished\r\n    deer. On April 12, took general view of all people, as follows:\r\n\r\n                               English    English    Portuguese\r\n                              in health    sick        sick\r\n\r\n               On shore          40         58           5\r\n        In the ‘Charles’         32         10\r\n          \"    ‘Roebuck’         16          2\r\n          \"    ‘Bull’             2          8\r\n          \"    ‘Reformation’     23         14          12\r\n          \"    ‘Abigail’          8          3\r\n          \"    ‘Rose’             7          2           5\r\n                               -----      -----       -----\r\n                                128         97          22\r\n\r\n    --leaving, of course, an immense proportion dead.\r\n\r\nThese are instances from the records of the East India Company during the\r\nfirst thirty years of its existence. It would be tedious, even if it were\r\npracticable, to follow the history continuously. But meanwhile to show\r\nthat its experiences, good and bad, remained much the same until long\r\nafter, let us take two voyages in the year 1682. Governor William Hedges,\r\npassenger on board one of the Company’s ships, enters in his diary the\r\n25th of May, 1682, being then off the Cape of Good Hope: “Not lost a man\r\n(except Mr Richards) either by sickness or any other accident, since we\r\nleft England, which wants but three days of four months, and is just two\r\nmonths since we passed the Equinoctial Line,” nothing being said of\r\nsickness in the rest of the voyage. But another of the Company’s ships the\r\nsame year fared worse: “December 9, 1682, ship ‘Society’ arrived at\r\nBalasore. She left the Downs on May 30, and, not touching at any place by\r\nthe way, lost seventeen men of the scurvy[1153].”\r\n\r\n\r\nSickness in the Colonizing of Virginia and New England.\r\n\r\nLeaving now the long voyages of the English beyond the Line, and their\r\nfactories in the East, let us see how they fared as regards health when\r\nthey merely crossed the Atlantic in their own latitudes. The earliest\r\nseries of voyages to Virginia, at Raleigh’s instigation, from 1585 to\r\n1590, have been already referred to. The continuous history of Atlantic\r\nvoyages, and of the North American colonies, begins with the expedition\r\nof 1609 under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers[1154].\r\n\r\nSeven of the ships fitted out in the Thames, and sailed from Woolwich on\r\nMay 15, 1609. Having been joined at Plymouth by two more, the fleet sailed\r\nthence on June 2, and from Falmouth on June 8. The expedition included\r\n“many unruly gallants, packed thither by their friends to escape ill\r\ndestinies,” with the proportion of women and children usual among\r\nemigrants, as well as horses, and probably other live stock. The\r\nnavigation, to reach Western land in 37° N., appears to have been somewhat\r\nerratic:\r\n\r\n    “We ran a southerly course from the tropic of Cancer, where, having\r\n    the sun within six or seven degrees right over our head in July, we\r\n    bore away West; so that by the fervent heat and loomes breezes, many\r\n    of our men fell sick of the calenture”--Noah Webster takes that to\r\n    mean a spotted pestilential fever--“and out of two ships was thrown\r\n    overboard thirty-two persons. The vice-admiral [the ‘Diamond’] was\r\n    said to have the plague in her; but in the ‘Blessing’ we had not any\r\n    sick, albeit we had twenty women and children.”\r\n\r\nA storm came on, in which the ships were scattered, the admiral’s ship\r\nbeing driven to the Bermudas and there wrecked[1155]. In the storm “some\r\nlost their masts, some had their sails blown from their yards; the seas\r\nover-raking our ships, much of our provision was spoiled, our fleet\r\nseparated, and our men sick, and many died; and in this miserable state we\r\narrived at Virginia.” The ‘Blessing,’ on board which was Gabriel Archer,\r\nthe principal narrator of events, seems to have fared better than the\r\nrest: “The ‘Unity’ was sore distressed when she came up with us; for, of\r\nseventy landmen [emigrants], she had not ten found, and all her seamen\r\nwere down, but only the master and his boy, with one poor sailor; but we\r\nrelieved them, and we four consorting, fell into the King’s River [James\r\nRiver] haply the 11th of August.” They found the colony “all in health\r\n(for the most part).” There were fourscore living 20 miles from the Fort,\r\nwho fed upon nothing but oysters eight weeks’ space. “After our four ships\r\nhad been in harbour a few days, came in the vice-admiral, having cut her\r\nmainmast overboard, and had many of her men very sick and weak.” This was\r\nthe ship that was said to have the plague in her. The admiral and his\r\nship’s company, wrecked on the Bermudas, fared in health best of all; the\r\nwhole number of 150 persons reached Jamestown in due course, to find only\r\n60 remaining alive of the 350 who had formed the complement of the other\r\nships. Part of the mortality had happened on board ship, but probably the\r\nmost of it after landing; Jamestown “is in a marish ground, low, flat to\r\nthe river, and hath no fresh water springs serving the town, but what we\r\ndrew from a well six or seven fathom deep, fed by the brackish river\r\noozing into it, from whence I verily believe the chief causes have\r\nproceeded of many diseases and sicknesses which have happened to our\r\npeople, who are indeed strangely afflicted with fluxes and agues.” Lord De\r\nLa Warre, one of the early governors, had a succession of illnesses--hot\r\nand violent ague, followed by a relapse still more violent and lasting a\r\nmonth, “then the flux surprised me and kept me many days,” then the cramp,\r\nwith strong pains, afterwards the gout, and finally the scurvy--which\r\nlast, however, might have been the eczema of gout, although it was said to\r\nhave been cured by the oranges and lemons of the Western Islands, and by\r\nthe voyage thither[1156].\r\n\r\nMuch in these early ventures was put down to climate, which was really due\r\nto other causes. There are, of course, unhealthy climates; but a great\r\ndeal of the talk in the 17th and 18th centuries about the “tainted air” of\r\n“foreign climes” was mere confusion of ideas. A more correct view of\r\nevents was that of the Governor and Council of Virginia, in a letter of\r\nJanuary 30, 1624, to the Virginia Company in London:\r\n\r\n    “The mortality, which is imputed to the country alone, is chiefly\r\n    caused by the pestilent ships, which reach Virginia victualled with\r\n    musty bread and stinking beer, heretofore so earnestly complained\r\n    of.... Robert Benet in his lifetime boasted that the sale of four\r\n    butts of wine would clear a voyage. Rotten wines destroy their bodies\r\n    and empty their purses[1157].”\r\n\r\nThe letter then goes on to relate how sickness had brought down great\r\nnumbers “since their last.” According to Purchas, the emigration to\r\nVirginia in three years immediately preceding this, the years 1619, 1620\r\nand 1621, had amounted to 3570 persons in 42 ships. Overcrowding, we may\r\nbe sure, was the rule. We shall find particular evidence of it in speaking\r\nof West Indian colonization in the sequel; and for the present, it may\r\nsuffice to quote a document of April 24, 1638, a list of 110 passengers\r\nfor New England per ‘Confidence’ of 200 tons.\r\n\r\nIf Virginia was settled by a crew of broken gallants and their humbler\r\nfollowers, the New England colony was officered by strict Puritans, who\r\nwere accompanied by men and women sharing, as nearly as might be, the same\r\nbeliefs and principles of conduct. The records of the Massachusetts Bay\r\nsettlements might be expected, therefore, to show less of sickness and\r\nfailure than the Virginian; and so, indeed, they do, although they are by\r\nno means clear of it. The first voyage of the ‘Mayflower’ in 1620,\r\ncarrying the small sect of Brownists who had tried Holland for a time as a\r\nplace of refuge, presents nothing for our purpose. Like the settlers along\r\nthe shores of Chesapeake Bay before them, these first New Englanders had\r\nto encounter famine and sickness. Famine appears to have been the cause\r\nalso of the disastrous epidemics among the Indians along the whole coast\r\nfrom Cape Cod to Cape Charles, on two occasions, the one previous to 1614\r\nand the other in 1619[1158]. The emigration to New England really began in\r\n1630, and of one of the expeditions of that year we have authentic\r\nparticulars by the leader of it, John Winthrop[1159]. On board the\r\n‘Arbella,’ under date April 17, 1630, he enters in his journal:\r\n\r\n    “This day our captain told me that our landmen were very nasty and\r\n    slovenly, and that the gun-deck, where they lodged, was so beastly and\r\n    noisome with their victuals and beastliness as would much endanger the\r\n    health of the ship. Hereupon, after prayer, we took order, and\r\n    appointed four men to see to it, and to keep that room clean for three\r\n    days, and then four others should succeed them, and so forth on.”\r\n\r\nNothing more is said of the health on board the ‘Arbella.’ The ‘Mayflower’\r\nand ‘Whale’ had their passengers all in health, but most of their cattle\r\nand horses dead. The ‘Success’ lost -- goats, and many of her passengers\r\nwere near starved. The ‘Talbot’ lost fourteen passengers. The colony had\r\nvarious experiences of sickness in due course. In 1633, smallpox proved\r\nfatal to whole settlements of Indians: “the English came daily and\r\nministered to them; and yet few, only two families, took any infection by\r\nit[1160].” In 1646 an epidemic of influenza went among the Indians,\r\nEnglish, French and Dutch, “not a family, nor but few persons, escaping\r\nit;” few died, not above 40 or 50 in Massachusetts, and near as many at\r\nConnecticut[1161]. In the spring of 1654, a general fast was appointed by\r\nthe government of Connecticut, one reason among others being “the\r\nmortality which had been among the people of Massachusetts.” In 1655 there\r\nwas another influenza, in 1658 “great sickness and mortality throughout\r\nNew England,” in 1659 “cynanche trachealis,” croup perhaps, and in 1662\r\nagain general sickness, which, along with drought, called for a day of\r\nthanksgiving on their cessation in October[1162]. It is beside the purpose\r\nto follow the epidemics in America minutely; but before quitting the\r\nsubject, the following, from a Philadelphia letter of August 24, 1699,\r\nwill suffice to keep in mind the conditions of emigration which prevailed\r\nlong after the first voyages: “Arrived the ‘Britannia’ from Liverpool,\r\nwhich had been 13 weeks on her passage; she had 200 passengers on\r\nboard,--had lost 50 by death, and others were sickly[1163].”\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Indian Colonization: Yellow Fever and the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\nThe other field of English colonial enterprise that concerns us is the\r\nWest Indies. The West Indian colonies of Britain play a great part in the\r\ncommercial history, in the naval history, and in the legislative history\r\nin connexion with the negro slave-trade and the institution of negro\r\nslavery. From the very first they play a great part, also, in the history\r\nof epidemic sickness; they and the Spanish, French and other colonies\r\nthere were the peculiar home of yellow fever for two centuries, having\r\nshared that unenviable distinction, after a generation or two, with\r\ncertain ports of the North American continent. The larger part of the\r\nhistory of yellow-fever epidemics falls outside the period to which I here\r\nlimit myself. But the beginnings fall within it; and as the beginnings\r\nraise the whole question of causation, this part of the subject resolves\r\nitself into a somewhat comprehensive discussion of the circumstances of\r\nyellow fever as illustrated by the first English colonizations in the\r\nCaribbean Sea, and the tradings connected therewith.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important disease-producing conditions in the West Indies\r\narose out of the Guinea slave-trade. But, so that we may set down to that\r\nno more than it deserves, we shall have to review also the earlier\r\nexperiences of English and French emigrants, both on the voyage and in\r\ntheir settlements in Barbados and St Christopher, and, at greatest length,\r\nthe disastrous first occupation of Jamaica in 1655 by the army of the\r\nCommonwealth. It will be convenient to begin the history, in which there\r\nis so much to disentangle, with a few facts about the negro labour-traffic\r\nto the New World previous to the time when the demands of the\r\nsugar-plantations caused it to be established on a great scale.\r\n\r\nAfrican negroes were brought first to the West Indies by the Spaniards to\r\nwork in the mines of Hispaniola. They are heard of as early as 1501, and\r\nare much in evidence after that date. The Christian conscience appears to\r\nhave been at first tender. It was the high purpose of Isabella of Spain to\r\nconvert the Indies to the Christian faith; and the cruelties of the negro\r\nimportation and of the forced labour in the mines were obviously\r\ninconsistent with the humanitarian teaching of the Gospels. The\r\nremonstrances of missionaries were listened to at the Spanish Court, and\r\nlicences to trade in negroes were either granted under strict conditions\r\nor withheld altogether. However, there were rapacious pro-consuls to deal\r\nwith as well as monarchs at home, and cargoes of slaves found their way\r\nto Cuba, to Hispaniola (St Domingo), and at length to the Spanish Main.\r\nEach importation as late as 1518 was still regulated by special licence;\r\nbut soon after that date a powerful minister sold the privilege to the\r\nGenoese, so that it passed somewhat beyond control of the Spanish\r\nCourt[1164]. Connected with these importations in the first quarter of the\r\n16th century, were the disastrous epidemics of two diseases with somewhat\r\nsimilar names and inextricably confused in the records--the great pox and\r\nthe small pox; it is not easy to say which did the most harm among the\r\nnative population of the islands and mainland occupied by Spain; but it is\r\nsaid that by disease of one kind or another Mexicans and Caribs on the\r\nmain, in Hispaniola, and in Cuba, came near to being exterminated[1165].\r\n\r\nThe first English share in the negro traffic over sea fell to John Hawkins\r\nand partners, who had not even the excuse of an open market for their\r\nwares in the Spanish colonies, and had sometimes to dispose of their\r\nnegroes by stealth. It would appear that it was still in part for the\r\nmines that African negroes were in request. In Richard Hawkins’ account of\r\nhis voyage to the Pacific in 1593, he mentions that he captured a\r\nPortuguese ship of 100 tons shortly after leaving the coast of Brazil;\r\nshe was bound for Angola to load negroes to be carried to and sold in the\r\nRiver Plate: “It is a trade of great profit and much used. The negroes are\r\ncarried to work in the mines of Potosi.”\r\n\r\nIt is not until a generation after that we hear of the English as\r\nslave-owners. On February 16, 1624, there were 22 negroes on the English\r\nsettlements in Virginia, the whites numbering 1253[1166]. In somewhat\r\ngreater numbers, negroes are next heard of in English possession in the\r\nBahamas; but, from the correspondence between the Company of Providence\r\nIsland in London and their agents in the colonies, it would appear that\r\nthe policy of using forced labour was by no means admitted by all, or free\r\nfrom difficulties. Thus in 1635 the Company condemned as indiscreet and\r\ninjurious Mr Rushworth’s behaviour concerning the negroes who ran away,\r\n“arising, as it seems, from a groundless opinion [of Rushworth] that\r\nChristians may not lawfully keep such persons in a state of servitude\r\nduring their strangeness from Christianity[1167].”\r\n\r\nWhatever negroes the English colonists possessed at this time they got\r\neither by capture or purchase from Dutch and other foreign traders. Thus,\r\nin the instructions to a shipmaster sailing from London, dated March 19,\r\n1636, captured negroes were to be conveyed to the Somers Islands, those\r\nwho can dive for pearls to be employed at Providence. Again, the\r\ninstructions to the captain of the ‘Mary Hope,’ bound for the West Indies,\r\nJanuary 20, 1637, refer to the distribution of negroes “if a prize be\r\ntaken.” And, on June 7, 1643, the earl of Warwick instructs the captain of\r\nthe ‘Elias,’ 400 tons, that captured negroes are “to be left at my island\r\nof Trinidad[1168].” The negro carrying-trade was in those years mostly in\r\nthe hands of the Dutch, who not only stocked their own colony of Surinam\r\non the mainland but used their small island of Curaçoa as a slave-depot\r\nfor the supply of colonies belonging to other nations. Thus the governor\r\nof Antigua, which had then no negroes, says in a despatch of about the\r\nyear 1670: “At Curaçoa they [the Dutch] send a vast quantity of negroes to\r\nthe Spaniard, and of late four ships from Jamaica for ready\r\npieces-of-eight carried thence great store. They intend to settle a mart\r\nfor negroes at Tortola to engross the trade of Porto Rico.”\r\n\r\nThe direct share of England in the negro carrying-trade arose out of the\r\nmonopoly of the Guinea Company. The history of English interests in Guinea\r\nand “Binney” need not detain us. When the first patent for sole trade was\r\ngranted in 1624, it was felt to be a grievance, as “many had been there\r\nalmost for fifty years since.” The charter was renewed on November 22,\r\n1631; but in course of time, some who had been ousted from their original\r\nshare in the monopoly traded on their own account, the rivalries at home\r\nbeing aggravated by conflicts with Swedes (in 1653) and Dutch at the\r\nfactories on the coast. The trade was ostensibly for gold dust and ivory,\r\nbut live freight soon found a place in English bottoms as well as in\r\nDutch, Swedish, Danish, French, Portuguese, Spanish and others. We may now\r\nreturn to our proper subject--the state of health in the first English and\r\nFrench plantations in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe English and French arrived in the West Indies almost at the same\r\nmoment. Their experiences were probably not very different, but it happens\r\nthat it is of the French emigrants that we have particulars, which it is\r\nimportant to introduce here.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1625, a Norman adventurer of good family, D’Enambuc, sailed\r\nfrom Dieppe in a brigantine armed with four pieces and manned with 35 or\r\n40 men, on a roving cruise to the West Indies[1169]. Having been battered\r\nby a Spanish galleon at the Kaymans, D’Enambuc made the island of St\r\nChristopher. He found it occupied by the native Caribs and a few stranded\r\nFrenchmen, who were on good terms with the natives. Shortly after, an\r\nEnglish captain (“Waërnard”) appears upon the scene, who joined D’Enambuc\r\nin the alleged murdering and poisoning of the natives and the plundering\r\nof the island. Loaded with his Carib spoils and a quantity of tobacco,\r\nD’Enambuc set sail for France, and having sold his tobacco and other\r\nthings in Normandy, entered Paris with a fine equipage, thus giving\r\nevidence to all men of the fortunes that awaited them in the Indies. In a\r\nshort time he had an audience of Richelieu, and on the 31st October 1626\r\nthe charter was signed of the Compagnie des Isles, granting a monopoly of\r\ntrade with “les isles situées à l’entreé du Perou”--namely St Christopher\r\nand Barbados. The Company raised 45,000 livres, of which capital Richelieu\r\nheld 10,000 livres in his own name. The money was spent in fitting out and\r\nfurnishing with stores three ships--the ‘Catholique’ at Havre, a craft of\r\n250 tons, and the ‘Cardinal’ and ‘Victoire’ at St Malo, two much smaller\r\nvessels. Numerous poor peasants and artisans from Brittany and Normandy\r\nwere induced to go out as colonists, the ‘Catholique’ (250 tons) carrying\r\n322 souls, the ‘Cardinal’ 70, and the ‘Victoire’ 140. The two last sailed\r\nfrom St Malo on February 24, 1627 under the command of Du Rossey. The\r\npassage was long, the provisions both bad and insufficient, and the\r\nmortality terrible. When the ‘Cardinal’ arrived at the Pointe de Sable of\r\nSt Christopher on May 8, only 16 of her 70 souls remained alive, and these\r\nwere sick. In the other ships, also, “most of the people died on the\r\npassage out.”\r\n\r\nThe English experience can hardly have been so bad as that. When the\r\nFrench colonists landed, they found four hundred Englishmen settled near\r\nthe chief anchorage, hale and strong and well stocked with provisions,\r\nhaving lately come out under Lord Carlisle’s patent. Cordial to each other\r\nat first, the two nationalities soon fell out. The French had rather the\r\nworst of it, having lost many of their number by sickness, while the\r\nEnglish kept their health. Help came to the former from home, and a\r\nvictory over the English is claimed for them. But they had also a Spanish\r\nfleet to reckon with, and eventually the French colony fell into disorder\r\nand escaped to Antigua, while its leader, Du Rossey, went home to France\r\nand was thrown into the Bastille by Richelieu, one of the largest\r\nshareholders. The refugees to Antigua soon returned to St Christopher,\r\nagain suffered from famine, and had the mortification of seeing all the\r\nprofits of their monopoly swallowed up by unlicensed Dutch traders. In\r\n1635 they obtained a new charter; at the same time a fortunate capture of\r\na ship-load of negroes from the Spaniards gave them a supply of labour so\r\nthat “the island began to change its face.” English usurpation was kept\r\nwithin limits, and the French colony grew daily, by addition of European\r\nsettlers and of “Moorish slaves whom the French and Dutch ships go to buy\r\nin Guinea, or capture from the Spaniards along the coasts of Brazil.” The\r\nFrench on St Christopher were now strong enough to send branch colonies to\r\nGuadeloupe and Martinique (1635). It was then the turn of the English to\r\nhave disastrous sickness among their immigrants. Sir Thomas Warner, who\r\nhad planted the English colonies in Barbados and St Christopher, and was\r\nnow governor of the latter, went to England in 1636 to bring over new\r\nsettlers. On his arrival out on 10 September, he wrote home that one of\r\nhis two ships, the ‘Plough,’ was given up for lost, and that in his own\r\nship there had been “great sickness and mortality, not 20 out of 200\r\nhaving escaped and 40 having died, some near to him in blood and many of\r\nespecial quality and use.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Barbados had been the chief scene of English enterprise, from a\r\ndate (1624-26) almost the same as that of the joint occupation of St\r\nChristopher by French and English. Its earliest annals contain little else\r\nthan the accounts of rivalries under Lord Carlisle’s patent and other\r\npatents. So far as regards sickness, the annals were probably uneventful.\r\nIn 1643 the island had plantations stocked with no fewer than 6400 negro\r\nslaves, and its prosperity advanced so steadily, that by the year 1666,\r\nthe slaves in the island numbered some 50,000: “The buildings in 1643 were\r\nmean; but in 1666 [when Bridgetown was burned], plate, jewels and\r\nhousehold stuff were estimated at £500,000[1170].” It is a date\r\nintermediate between those two that directly concerns us--the year 1647.\r\nIn that year, Ligon, the historian of the colony, arrived out from England\r\nabout the beginning of September[1171]. The ship in which he came to\r\nBarbados was consigned thence to Cutchew, on the African coast, to trade\r\nfor negroes. On their arrival they found twenty-two good ships at anchor\r\nin Carlisle Bay (Bridgetown), a brisk trade going on, and plantations\r\nvisible all along the shore. A plantation of 500 acres had 96 negroes and\r\n28 Christians; some plantations contained 10,000 acres. The population was\r\ndifficult to estimate, so many ships were arriving with passengers daily;\r\nand Ligon’s estimate of 50,000, “besides negroes,” is doubtless too much.\r\nAbout one hundred sail visit the island every year; they bring “servants”\r\nand negro slaves, both men and women. The servants are bound for five\r\nyears, and are worse treated than the negroes. The negroes are more than\r\ndouble the number of the Christians; they come from different parts of\r\nAfrica--Bonny, Cutchew, Angola and Gambia--and do not understand each\r\nother’s language. They are bought out of the ship naked, being chosen as\r\nhorses are in a market, the strongest, youthfullest and most beautiful\r\nyielding the highest price (man £30, woman £25 to £27, children at easier\r\nrates).\r\n\r\nWe have to note, also, Ligon’s account of the colony’s chief\r\nharbour--Bridgetown. The whole of Carlisle Bay is environed by high\r\nground. Bridgetown is so-called “for that a long bridge was made at first\r\nover a little nook of the sea, which was rather a bog than sea.” The\r\nstream which discharges there into the bay is like a lake for want of\r\noutfall. The spring tides fill it, but during the neap tides the salt\r\nwater is kept stagnant behind the sea-banks, making a small lagoon. The\r\nspring tides seldom rise above four or five feet, but high enough to flow\r\nover the low ground in front of the houses, making the flat a kind of bog,\r\nwhich vents out a loathsome savour.\r\n\r\nLigon landed at Bridgetown about the beginning of September, 1647, in time\r\nto witness the ravages of a deadly epidemic:\r\n\r\n    “Yet, notwithstanding all this appearance of trade, the inhabitants of\r\n    the island, and shipping too, were so grievously visited with the\r\n    plague (or as killing a disease) that before a month was expired after\r\n    our arrival, the living were hardly able to bury the dead. Whether it\r\n    was brought thither by shipping, (for in long voyages diseases grow at\r\n    sea and take away many passengers, and these diseases prove\r\n    contagious), or by the distemper of the people of the island”--he\r\n    leaves uncertain. For one woman that died, there were ten men. The\r\n    ships at anchor in Carlisle Bay were, for the most part, infected with\r\n    this disease.\r\n\r\nWhat was the disease? How came it there? What sort of origin did its\r\ncharacters, symptoms, or type suggest? On these questions we have some\r\nlight thrown by other writings besides Ligon’s, relating to the same\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\nJohn Winthrop, the Governor of Massachusetts, writes in his journal, under\r\nthe year 1647[1172]:\r\n\r\n    “It pleased the Lord to open to us a trade with Barbados and other\r\n    islands in the West Indies, which as it proved gainful, so the\r\n    commodities we had in exchange there for our cattle and provisions, as\r\n    sugar, cotton, tobacco and indigo, were a good help to discharge our\r\n    engagements in England. And this summer there was so great a drouth as\r\n    their potatoes and corn, etc. were burnt up; and divers London ships\r\n    which rode there were so short of provisions as, if our vessels had\r\n    not supplied them, they could not have returned home.... After the\r\n    great dearth of victuals in these islands followed presently a great\r\n    mortality (whether it were the plague, or pestilent fever, it killed\r\n    in three days), that in Barbados there died six thousand, and in\r\n    Christophers, of English and French, near as many, and in other\r\n    islands proportionable.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of the French on St Christopher brings us to the third source\r\nof information, the Jesuit father Dutertre, who was an eye-witness[1173]:\r\n\r\n    “During this same year, 1648, the plague (la peste), hitherto unknown\r\n    in the islands since they were inhabited by the French, was brought\r\n    thither by certain ships. It began in St Christopher, and in the\r\n    eighteen months that it lasted, it carried off nearly one-third of the\r\n    inhabitants.” This plague, or peste, was marked by violent pain in the\r\n    head, general debility of all the muscles, and continual vomiting. It\r\n    was contagious. A ship, the ‘Bœuf’ of Rochelle, carried it to\r\n    Guadeloupe, the sailors and passengers dying on board of her. A priest\r\n    went on board to administer the sacraments, and caught the infection;\r\n    he recovered, but [had a relapse and] died on August 4. It was\r\n    contagious at Guadeloupe also, and lasted twenty months.\r\n\r\nThis testimony of Dutertre is important for several things. He had arrived\r\nat Guadeloupe in 1640 in a small vessel of 100 to 120 tons, crowded with\r\nstores and carrying besides, 200 souls of both sexes and all ages. Much\r\ndistress and sickness followed their arrival; he mentions nearly 100 sick\r\nin the quarters of M. de la Vernade, with only the ground to sleep on;\r\nmore than three-fourths of the help for the struggling colony that arrived\r\nfrom St Christopher died, perhaps by infectious disease bred by the\r\nothers. Now, with that personal experience in his mind, and with personal\r\nexperience also of the epidemic of 1647-8, he describes the latter as a\r\npestilence “hitherto unknown in the islands since they were inhabited by\r\nthe French.” Like Ligon and Winthrop, he is led to think of plague itself\r\nby the rapidity and fatality of the infection; but he mentions no signs of\r\nplague proper, and at the same time mentions continual vomiting. The\r\ndisease was, in short, the Yellow Fever; and the epidemic in the end of\r\n1647 at Bridgetown, and shortly after at St Christopher and Guadeloupe,\r\nwas the first of it, so far as is known, in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nBut what then were the earlier epidemics spoken of by Dutertre? The branch\r\ncolony to Guadeloupe from St Christopher in 1635 had been only two months\r\nin their new home, when, in September, their experiences of famine began.\r\nThe famine or scarcity, says Dutertre, continued for five years, and was\r\nfollowed by “a mortality almost general.” It was part of that mortality\r\nwhich Dutertre himself saw on his arrival at Guadeloupe in 1640. He calls\r\nthe fever _coup de barre_--a name which in the sequel was sometimes given\r\nto yellow fever; and he mentions symptoms which agree, in part at least,\r\nwith those of yellow fever--violent pains in the head, throbbing of the\r\ntemporal arteries, great distress of breathing, lassitude, pains in the\r\ncalf of the legs, as if they had been struck by a _coup de barre_. But in\r\nspeaking of the sickness which he found prevalent on landing in 1640, he\r\ndoes not mention the irrepressible vomiting, which he puts in the first\r\nplace when he describes the other fever of 1647-8; and, to repeat, he says\r\nthat the latter was a pestilence hitherto unknown since the occupation of\r\nthe French Antilles, and as fatal as the plague. It is tolerably certain,\r\ntherefore, that the sickness on Guadeloupe sometime between 1635 and 1640,\r\nwas of the usual kind incidental to the settlement of a new colony. We\r\nhave had to notice it in Virginia (“from pestilent ships,” the governor\r\nthought), in St Christopher, and in other new settlements. In a petition\r\nof the Governor and Company of the Somers Islands, July 28, 1639, it is\r\nsaid that about one hundred and thirty of their colonists had transplanted\r\nthemselves last year to St Lucia, where they suffered so much from\r\nsickness that not one was in health[1174]. Any one of those epidemics\r\namong new settlers might be diagnosed yellow fever with as much warrant as\r\nanother; but the deadly infection of 1647-8 was something special,\r\ndifferent from all that had preceded, and to be accounted the first\r\nappearance of yellow fever whether in the West Indies or anywhere\r\nelse[1175].\r\n\r\nYellow fever received much elucidation in after years, both as regards its\r\nsymptoms and pathology, and as regards its circumstances and causation. To\r\nget a familiar view of what the disease was like, let us take the\r\nfollowing graphic case recorded by Moseley at Jamaica more than a century\r\nafter the date with which we are still engaged[1176]:\r\n\r\n    “The last patient I saw, in the last stage of the yellow fever, was\r\n    Captain Mawhood of the 85th regt. at Port Royal, in Jamaica on the\r\n    24th Sept., 1780. It was on the fourth day of his illness. He had been\r\n    in the island seven weeks.\r\n\r\n    I arrived at the lodgings of this much esteemed young man about four\r\n    hours before his death. When I entered the room, he was vomiting a\r\n    black, muddy cruor; and was bleeding at the nose. A bloody ichor was\r\n    oozing from the corners of his eyes, and from his mouth and gums. His\r\n    face was besmeared with blood; and with the dulness of his eyes, it\r\n    presented a most distressing contrast to his natural visage. His\r\n    abdomen was swelled, and inflated prodigiously. His body was all over\r\n    of a deep yellow, interspersed with livid spots. His hands and feet\r\n    were of a livid hue. Every part of him was cold excepting about his\r\n    heart. He had a deep, strong hiccup, but neither delirium nor coma;\r\n    and was at my first seeing him, as I thought, in his perfect senses.\r\n    He looked at the changed appearance of his skin, and expressed, though\r\n    he could not speak, by his sad countenance, that he knew life was soon\r\n    to yield up her citadel, now abandoning the rest of his body.\r\n    Exhausted with vomiting, he at last was suffocated with the blood he\r\n    was endeavouring to bring up, and expired.”\r\n\r\nOne of the best summaries of its symptoms is that given by the Rev.\r\nGriffith Hughes, rector of one of the Barbados parishes[1177]:\r\n\r\n    “The attack begins with a feeling of chill lasting an hour or two.\r\n    Then violent fever comes on, with excessive pain in the head, back,\r\n    and limbs, loss of strength, great dejection of spirits, insatiable\r\n    thirst, restlessness, sometimes vomiting, redness of the eyes, and\r\n    that redness in a few days turning to yellow. If the patient turn\r\n    yellow soon, he has scarce a chance for life, and, the sooner he does,\r\n    the worse. After some days the pain in the head abates, as well as the\r\n    fever. A sweat breaks out, and the patient appears to be better; but\r\n    on a narrow view a yellowness appears in his eyes and skin, and he\r\n    becomes visibly worse. About this time he sometimes spits blood, and\r\n    that by mouthfuls; as this continues, he grows cold and his pulse\r\n    abates till at last it is quite gone, and the patient becomes almost\r\n    as cold as a stone, and continues in that state with a composed sedate\r\n    mind. In this condition he may perhaps live twelve hours, without any\r\n    sensible pulse or heat, and then expire. Such were the symptoms and\r\n    progress of this fever in the year 1715.” He adds that the hæmorrhage\r\n    was sometimes from the nose or rectum. “A loose tooth being drawn from\r\n    a person who had the fever very severely, there issued out from the\r\n    hole a great quantity of black stinking blood, which still kept oozing\r\n    till the third day, on which the patient died in great agonies and\r\n    convulsions.” The symptoms were not uniform in all, nor in every\r\n    visitation. It was most commonly rife and fatal in May, June, July and\r\n    August, and then mostly among strangers, though a great many of the\r\n    inhabitants died of it in 1696 and a great many at different periods\r\n    since. (The next Barbados epidemic after 1647 was in 1671.)\r\n\r\nNow, of that remarkable disease, a pestilent fever with hæmorrhages,\r\nhaving a final stage of collapse not unlike the algid termination of\r\ncholera, and a mortality equalled only by that of plague itself, or, in\r\nafter times, by that of cholera, it will be difficult to find instances in\r\nany part of the world previous to the Barbados, St Christopher, and\r\nGuadeloupe epidemics of 1647-48. Not only so, but these and other West\r\nIndian harbours were the distinctive seats of it for long after. From\r\nfirst to last yellow fever has been an infection of certain harbours--of\r\nthe shipping anchored, moored, or careened in them, and of the houses\r\nnearest to the shore. In the Barbados epidemic of 1647, Ligon says, the\r\nships at anchor in Carlisle Bay were for the most part infected; Dutertre\r\nsays that the crew and passengers died of it on board the ship which\r\nbrought it to Guadeloupe; he says, also, that it had come to St\r\nChristopher with certain ships; and Ligon clearly suspects that it may\r\nhave had an origin on board ship: “for in long voyages diseases grow at\r\nsea and take away many passengers, and these diseases prove contagious.”\r\nWe have had many instances of the sicknesses of voyages, not only scurvy\r\nbut also fevers. But these ship-fevers were not yellow fever; we know more\r\nof them in later periods of the history, when they were recognized as\r\nship-typhus. For yellow fever we must seek something more distinctive, and\r\nthat distinctive thing we shall probably find in a kind of voyage which we\r\nhave not hitherto considered from the point of view of its sicknesses--the\r\nMiddle Passage, or the voyage with negroes from the African coast across\r\nthe tropical belt to one part or another of the New World. Let us then\r\ntake that particular kind of voyage, as we have already taken the voyages\r\nof the East India Company’s ships, the voyages of emigrant ships from\r\nEngland to the North-American Colonies, and those from France and England\r\nto the West Indies.\r\n\r\nDutertre, our authority for the first yellow fever in St Christopher, is\r\nalso a witness to the sicknesses and mortality of the Middle Passage. Of\r\nthe negroes, he says, more die on the passage than land. He has known\r\ncaptains who have taken on board up to 700 in one ship and landed only\r\n200; they died of misery and hunger, and the stifling monotony of tropical\r\ncalms. Some of the slaves are of high degree; there was one negress, in\r\nparticular, whom all the rest looked up to as a princess.\r\n\r\nThe African slave-trade was not altogether so reputable as to have had the\r\nincidents of the voyages recorded with anything approaching to scientific\r\nfulness. But within the period that now occupies us, there are four\r\nnotices of arrivals of slavers in the West Indies from Guinea, in which\r\nthe health of the voyage had called for remark[1178]. In a letter from\r\nBarbados, March 20, 1664, it is said that the ‘Speedwell’ has arrived with\r\n282 negroes, who have greatly lost in value owing to smallpox breaking out\r\namongst them; the ‘Success’ brought 193 blacks; the ‘Susan’ 230, which\r\nwere not allowed to be landed until the officers of the ship had proved\r\nthat they had not collected them within the Royal African Company’s\r\nlimits. Another Barbados letter of March 31, 1664, says that “there has\r\nbeen a great mortality amongst the negroes [? on St Christopher and Nevis]\r\nwhich the African Company’s physician at Barbados, De La Rouse, assures\r\nthem is through a malignant distemper contracted, they think, through so\r\nmany sick and decaying negroes being thronged together, and perhaps\r\nfurthered by the smallpox in Captain Carteret’s ships. Most men refused to\r\nreceive any of them, and Philip Fusseires, a surgeon, to whom they sold\r\ntwenty at a low rate, lost every one.” This is a confused letter, but the\r\nreference to “sick and decaying negroes thronged together,” appears to\r\nmean, not a sharp sickness soon over, but a general sickly state and loss\r\nof condition, which had come upon them during the voyage[1179]. The third\r\nletter is from Barbados, June 25, 1667: from Guinea are arrived four\r\nships, two of the African Company’s, and two private; in which had\r\nhappened a great mortality of negroes and of the ships’ companies. Once\r\nmore, to bring out the long imprisonment of negroes under decks while the\r\nslaver was filling up on the coast, T. Barrett writing from Port Royal on\r\nOctober 17, 1672, to James Littleton, “has heard that Capt. James Tallers\r\nbought the negroes for Littleton from another ship in Guinea which had\r\nthem three months aboard, and that they were almost all starved and\r\nsurfeycatted [surfeit had come to mean dysentery], he having fed them with\r\nlittle else but musty corn. There must have been something extraordinary\r\nthat so many of them died.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the letters we hear of sickness and mortality not only of slaves\r\non the passage but also of the ships’ companies. Long after, Clarkson\r\nshowed from the muster-rolls of Liverpool slave-ships that the\r\nslave-trade, instead of being a “nursery” of British sailors, was their\r\ngrave[1180]. There are, however, few medical particulars; doubtless many\r\nof the deaths among the crews occurred on the coast, from fever, dysentery\r\nand the like brought on by debauchery and during trading excursions up the\r\nrivers in the long-boat; but from the third of the letters quoted it\r\nappears that there had been also deaths on the voyage. Of the sicknesses\r\namong the negroes, more is said of smallpox than of any other malady in\r\nthe foregoing records. But smallpox was not in ordinary circumstances a\r\nvery fatal or very severe disease among negroes, although it was very\r\ncommon. An early medical writer on the diseases of the Guinea Coast, both\r\nof white men and negroes, Dr Aubrey, “who resided many years on the coast\r\nof Guinea,” may pass as a credible witness in the matter, the more so as\r\nhis book shows him to have been competent in his profession[1181].\r\n\r\n“Measles and smallpox,” he says, “are no ways dangerous, nor so\r\ntroublesome as in cold climates, neither are they so very sick e’er they\r\ncome out, nor remains there any great sign of them after they recover.\r\nAbundance of these poor creatures are lost on board ships, to the great\r\nprejudice of the owners and scandal of the surgeon, merely through the\r\nsurgeon’s ignorance; because he knows not what they are afflicted with,\r\nbut supposing it to be a fever, bleeds and purges or vomits them into an\r\nincurable diarrhœa, and in a very few days they become a feast for some\r\nhungry shark. When they are in the woods sick of these diseases, they take\r\nnothing but cold water, and suck oranges, and yet recover, as I myself\r\nhave been an eyewitness many a time; and the grandy-men’s children are\r\ntreated no otherwise in their sickness, and are very well of the smallpox\r\nin less than half a moon,” etc. It is conceivable, however, that smallpox\r\nleft to itself would not have run so favourable a course in the hold of a\r\nslaver as in the native huts of the negroes. On board ship the subjects of\r\nsmallpox died from a complication of diarrhœa; and, according to the same\r\nwriter, diarrhœa or dysentery was the grand cause of mortality on the\r\nvoyage, the most inveterate form of it, (according to his fixed belief),\r\noccurring in those who had been constitutionally affected by yaws: “This\r\n(the yawey flux) is the mortal disease that cuts off three parts in four\r\nof the negroes that are commonly lost on board ships.” But the same writer\r\nreveals enough to let us understand the prevalence of flux as a primary\r\nmalady. The food of the slaves on board ship, to say nothing of the\r\nregimen, was distasteful to them. They missed their palm oil and other\r\naccustomed articles of diet. They were fed, morning and evening, on pease,\r\nbeans, and the like, mixed with “rotten salt herrings,” with an occasional\r\nmeal of salt beef or salt pork, and a stinted allowance of water.\r\n\r\n    “These are foods that very few of them will eat. Very often they are\r\n    abused by sailors, who beat and kick them to that degree that\r\n    sometimes they never recover; and then the surgeon is blamed for\r\n    letting the slaves die, when they are murthered, partly by strokes and\r\n    partly famished; for if they do not eat such salt things as are enough\r\n    to destroy them, they must fast till supper; and then they lose their\r\n    appetites, and perhaps fall sick, partly through fasting and partly\r\n    with grief to see themselves so treated; and if once they take\r\n    anything to heart, all the surgeon’s art will never keep them alive;\r\n    for they never eat anything by fair means or foul, because they choose\r\n    rather to die than be ill-treated.... When they are costive and griped\r\n    [by the salt food], they stay betwixt decks and will eat nothing; but\r\n    cry _yarry, yarry_, and perhaps creep under one of the platforms and\r\n    hide themselves, and die there, and the surgeon can’t think what is\r\n    the meaning on’t..., I am very sensible that it is impossible to\r\n    maintain the slaves on board, after one quits the Coast, without salt\r\n    provisions; but then care might be taken to water the beef and pork\r\n    ere it be boiled, and also to bring a cruce of palm-oil round the deck\r\n    from mess to mess, and also pepper, and let everyone take as he\r\n    pleaseth.... Another principal cause of their destruction is forcing\r\n    them into a tub of cold water every day, and pouring the water on\r\n    their heads by buckets-full”--doubtless for the sake of cleanliness,\r\n    although they were too ill to stand such washings.\r\n\r\nWhatever else the negroes died of on the voyage from Guinea, they did not\r\ndie of yellow fever: there is hardly another generality of pathology so\r\nwell based as that Africans of pure blood have been found immune from that\r\ninfection in all circumstances ashore or afloat--protected not by\r\nacclimatisation but by some strange privilege of their race. And yet we\r\nhave to think of yellow fever as somehow related to the over-sea traffic\r\nin negroes. Two instances from the later history will serve to bring the\r\nproblem concretely before us. In 1815, a British transport, the ‘Regalia,’\r\nwas employed in carrying recruits from the West Coast of Africa to the\r\nblack regiments in the West Indies. The health of the ship when on the\r\nAfrican coast had been good; but on the voyage across with the\r\nnewly-enlisted negroes, much sickness, chiefly dysenteric, occurred among\r\nthe latter, whereupon yellow fever broke out with great malignancy,\r\nattacking all on board except the black soldiers, who were from first to\r\nlast untouched by it. From such experiences as that, Sir Gilbert Blane\r\nformulated a somewhat vague doctrine that the causes which produced\r\ndysentery in the negro produced yellow fever in the white race. But it is\r\nmore probable that the dysenteric matters of the negroes had themselves in\r\nturn bred an infection of yellow fever for the whites. To take another\r\ncase: In 1795, after the capture of Martinique from the French, one of the\r\nfrigates ‘La Pique,’ was manned by a British crew and sent to Barbados. On\r\nthe voyage they rescued two hundred negroes from a ship which was about\r\nfoundering. The negroes were confined in the hold of ‘La Pique;’ and in a\r\nshort time yellow fever broke out among her English crew, killing one\r\nhundred and fifty of them, although it was not prevalent among the blacks\r\nat all. “Such a mixture of men,” says Gillespie, “strangers to each other,\r\nhas been often found to occasion sickness in ships; and, together with\r\nother causes, fatally operated here before the arrival of the ship at\r\nBarbados.... This is a melancholy instance of the generation of a fatal\r\nepidemic on board ship at a time when the inhabitants of Barbados and the\r\ncrews of the other ships in company remained free from any such\r\ndisease[1182].”\r\n\r\nBut such instances are comparatively rare, while epidemics of yellow fever\r\non shore, or among the shipping in an anchorage, have been common. It is\r\npossible that the yellow fever experiences of the ‘Regalia’ and ‘La Pique’\r\nhad happened often to the white crews of slavers; we shall never know.\r\nWhat we do know is that the ports of debarkation of the slave-trade\r\nbecame the endemic seats of yellow fever. The theory is that the matters\r\nproductive of yellow fever were brought to the West Indian harbours,\r\ndeposited there, left to ferment and accumulate, and so to taint the soil,\r\nthe mud and the water as to become an enduring source of poisonous\r\nmiasmata. The facts in support of that view are not far to seek.\r\n\r\nLet us come back to the circumstances of Bridgetown, Barbados, when the\r\nyellow fever broke out first in 1647. A good many slavers had landed their\r\ncargoes at Bridgetown in the years preceding (in 1643 the island had at\r\nleast 6400 negroes), and each of them had left behind a material quantity\r\nof the filth of the voyage, having probably been careened for the purpose\r\nof cleaning out and overhauling. There are traditions still extant that\r\nthe cleaning of a slave-ship after a voyage from Africa was an exceptional\r\ntask, to which Kroomen used to be set. Be that as it may, it needs only a\r\nlittle reflection to see that a crowd of some hundreds of negroes under\r\ngratings in the hold or ’tween decks of a brig or schooner, suffering at\r\nfirst from sickness of the sea and, as the voyage across the tropic belt\r\nprogressed, from the more distressing flux, must have set all rules of\r\ncleanliness at defiance. The ship’s bilges and ballast would be foul\r\nbeyond measure: and it was just the contents of her bilges, with or\r\nwithout the ballast itself, that would be pumped out or thrown out when\r\nthe ship was moored in the harbour or careened on the mud. At Bridgetown\r\nthere were no plunging tides, such as we watch on our own shores, to carry\r\nthe filth out to sea. The spring tides, says Ligon, rose only four or five\r\nfeet; the flood tide carried the water over the banks into the lagoon, and\r\nthe ebb carried it off; but at neap tides a quantity of water remained\r\nstagnant behind the sea-banks, according to the familiar experience in\r\nsuch circumstances. The flat shore, says Ligon, became “a kind of bog,\r\nwhich vents out so loathsome a savour as cannot but breed ill blood, and\r\nis (no doubt) the occasion of much sickness to those that live there.” A\r\nbrackish estuary, with an impeded outfall, will often smell badly, from\r\nrotting sea-wrack or other decomposing matters; but we have yet to learn\r\nthat any so commonplace conditions can breed a deadly pestilence such as\r\narose at Bridgetown for the first time in the autumn of 1647. Carlisle\r\nBay was doubtless a leeward harbour, with high land all round it and a\r\nsluggish ebb and flow of the tide, subject to calms and a scorching sun;\r\nbut besides all that, the careenage at the head of the bay was the regular\r\nreceptacle of the ordure of slave-ships year after year. Travellers and\r\nimaginative writers have sometimes pictured the bays and creeks of the\r\nislands and main of the Caribbean Sea as if the mere decay of tropical\r\nvegetation had made them pestilential[1183]. Risk, of course, there is in\r\nsuch situations, but chiefly when men are exposed by turns to the noonday\r\nheat and the nocturnal chill. The ill repute of West Indian harbours, with\r\ntheir sweltering mud, mangrove swamps, and lazy tides, is a composite and\r\nconfused idea. It is not so much Nature that has made them unwholesome, as\r\nman. Yellow fever, in particular, is not a miasm of remote and primeval\r\nbays or lagoons into which a boat’s crew may come once and again; it is\r\nnot a fever of any and every part of the coast of a tropical island; it is\r\na fever of only a few inhabited spots on the wide shores of the globe; and\r\nthose seats of it, so far as it has been steady or periodic in its\r\nprevalence, are all of them harbours distinguished at one time or another\r\nas the resort of slave-ships, and distinguished from many other ports of\r\neither Hemisphere in no other way. Everything in the subsequent history of\r\nyellow fever pointed to its being a poison lurking in the mud or even in\r\nthe water of slave-ports, and in the soil of their fore-shores, wharves\r\nand houses along the beach. Miasmata rose from the ground in the latter\r\nsituations, to taint the air of the town at certain seasons; the poison\r\nalso entered the bilges of ships moored or careened in the harbour, and\r\nrose from the holds as a noxious vapour to infect the crews. The miasmata\r\nwere deadly for the most part to new comers, especially to those from the\r\ncolder latitudes, although acclimatised residents were not exempt in a\r\ntime of epidemic; but there is very general agreement that they carried no\r\nrisk for negroes of pure blood.\r\n\r\nWhat was there special in the circumstances of 1647 to give rise to the\r\nfirst epidemic explosion of yellow fever? There was, in the first place,\r\nthe accretion of the peculiar fermenting filth in the mud and soil, which\r\nhad been going on for several years. Secondly, there was the brisk trade,\r\nas indicated by the large number of ships in the harbour, a great\r\nconcourse of new arrivals having been often remarked in the later history\r\nas one of the conditions of an outbreak. But more particularly there were\r\nthe peculiarities of the season: it was one of those seasons in which the\r\nregular rains of June and following months had failed. What we know on\r\nthat head comes exclusively from Winthrop’s ‘Journal,’ already quoted.\r\nThere was so great a drouth, he says, that their potatoes, corn, &c., were\r\nburnt up; and after the “great dearth of victuals in these islands\r\nfollowed presently a great mortality.” But the mortality was certainly not\r\nfrom famine, nor from the effects of famine. It was the parching drought\r\nthat the epidemic really followed, and not merely the scarcity, which was,\r\nindeed, relieved by the ships from New England, and was so little felt\r\nthat Ligon does not mention it. The rainy season missed, or all but\r\nmissed, in a tropical country means a great fall of the ground water; it\r\nmeans the pores of the ground filled with air to an unusual extent; and\r\nthat is a state of any soil, if it be already full of fermenting organic\r\nmatters, which breeds the most dangerous half-products of decomposition,\r\nor, in other words, the most poisonous miasmata. There needs always some\r\nsuch special determining thing to explain the epidemic outbursts of yellow\r\nfever; in the later history we shall see that the first great epidemic of\r\nit at Jamaica followed immediately upon the earthquake that destroyed Port\r\nRoyal.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of the ordinary principle that seasonal and periodic\r\ninfection is dependent on the state of the ground water, are given at\r\ngreater length in the chapters upon the later epidemics of plague in\r\nLondon. What applies in that respect to one soil-poison applies to\r\nanother; and it will be shown in the proper place to apply with least\r\nambiguity of all to Asiatic cholera, as well as to typhoid fever. Yellow\r\nfever is, in clinical characters, allied more to typhus than to typhoid;\r\nbut it is a typhus of the soil, whereas the common and much less fatal\r\ntyphus of ordinary domestic life in colder latitudes is an infection\r\nabove ground--of the air, walls, floors and furnishings of rooms. There is\r\nthe same relation between yellow fever and ordinary typhus in that\r\nrespect, as between plague and ordinary typhus. When ordinary typhus has\r\npassed into a soil-poison, by aggravation of conditions, as in the\r\nexperience of Arab encampments in North Africa, it has become at the same\r\ntime bubonic fever, or, approximately plague proper. Yellow fever had its\r\nhabitat essentially in the soil, from the peculiar circumstances\r\n(importation of the crude materials of it by ships engaged in the\r\nslave-trade); and plague in ordinary, or in European experience, had also\r\nits habitat in the soil, from circumstances which have been elsewhere\r\ngiven as its probable conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps because they are soil-poisons that those two diseases rank\r\nso high in their fatality and quickness of execution, in which respects\r\nthey resemble Asiatic cholera, and differ from most other infections.\r\nWinthrop says that the first yellow fever killed in three days, and was\r\ntherefore comparable to the plague. Ligon says that it was as killing a\r\ndisease as the plague (of which both he and Winthrop would have had old\r\nexperience at home), and he uses the stock phrase, that the living were\r\nhardly able to bury the dead. Winthrop says that 6000 died in Barbados:\r\nand one of his correspondents in the island, Vines, writes that “in our\r\nparish there were buried twenty in a week, and many weeks together fifteen\r\nor sixteen.” Dutertre says that nearly a third of the colonists of St\r\nChristopher died of it, and that it lingered there for eighteen months,\r\nand for twenty months in Guadeloupe, whither it was believed to have been\r\nbrought in the ship ‘Le Bœuf.’\r\n\r\nBarbados, St Christopher and Guadeloupe (with minor settlements on\r\nMartinique, Nevis, &c.) were the earliest English and French colonies in\r\nthe Caribbean Sea. The Spaniards had occupied the Greater Antilles\r\n(Hispaniola or San Domingo, Cuba, Porto Rico and Jamaica) long before.\r\nNothing particular is known of the health of these colonies except for the\r\nearlier years of the 16th century, when the native populations were\r\nravaged by the great pox and the smallpox. But when Jamaica was seized\r\nfrom the Spaniards by the army of the Commonwealth in 1655 we begin to\r\nhave authentic information, the state of health being perhaps the most\r\nprominent thing (although little noticed by historians) in the despatches.\r\nThat incident in the expansion of England, relating as it does to the\r\nplanting of what was for long our greatest island colony, and illustrating\r\nthe risks of those early enterprises more fully than any other of the\r\nkind, may fitly come into this chapter and conclude it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Mortality in the occupying of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector’s design in the year 1654, to acquire one or more of\r\nthe Spanish Antilles for an English colony, was more methodically\r\nconceived and more strenuously supported by the resources of the State\r\nthan any previous attempt at colonization. It was attended with disasters\r\non a proportionate scale, and at first with ignominy and failure which\r\nmust have added seriously to the burden of Cromwell’s later years. The\r\noriginal design, in the admiral’s sealed orders, was to seize upon the old\r\nSpanish colony of Hispaniola or San Domingo[1184]. A fleet had been fitted\r\nout at Portsmouth, which sailed on 19th-21st December, 1654, carrying a\r\nland force of three thousand men. After a favourable voyage, the fleet of\r\nthirty sail, half of them victuallers, arrived at Barbados on February 1,\r\nwhere they lay until March 31, engaging settlers for the proposed new\r\ncolony as well as campaigners, including a troop of cavalry, from the not\r\nvery choice class of English subjects in that island. Some twenty Dutch\r\nships were seized and made victuallers or transports. The expedition\r\nreceived a draft also from Nevis, and calling at St Christopher they took\r\nup 1300 more, making in all an addition of over 5000 colonial men, besides\r\nwomen and children, to their original force. On April 13 the fleet arrived\r\noff the harbour of St Domingo. It came out afterwards that the sight of so\r\nmany English frigates and other ships had driven the townspeople to\r\ninstantaneous flight, so that the capital would have fallen to the\r\nEnglish without a blow. But no landing was attempted in the harbour,\r\nowing to difficulties about piloting, ignorance of the depth of water, and\r\nthe like. It was decided to disembark the force in a bay at the mouth of a\r\nriver some six or ten miles (two leagues) to the eastward, where Drake had\r\nlanded in 1586. Most of the ships, however, were carried past the\r\nappointed place, and came to anchor in another bay thirty miles (ten\r\nleagues) eastwards from St Domingo; there a multitude of some 7000\r\nsoldiers and colonials, with their women and children, were landed on the\r\nbeach with three days’ rations. Several of the ships landed their men at\r\nthe original rendezvous two leagues from St Domingo, to the number of\r\nabout 2000 in three regiments. The larger and farther-off force began to\r\nadvance on St Domingo through dense woods; their presence in the country\r\nwas soon known in all the plantations, whence the people fled to the\r\ncapital for safety, so that the San Domingans were able to extemporise a\r\nconsiderable force for defence. The advance of the English was hindered by\r\nthe stifling heat; distressed by thirst, they ate immoderately of oranges\r\nand other fruits, and in one way or another brought on dysentery. General\r\nVenables, in a despatch to Cromwell, says that by these causes they “were\r\ntroubled with violent fluxes, hundreds of our men having dropped down by\r\nthe way, some sick, others dead.” Meanwhile the nearer and smaller force\r\nof some 2000 had advanced on St Domingo; they got over one of the two\r\nleagues between them and the capital, but an old fort, manned for the\r\noccasion, barred the way, and the regiments fell back upon the river\r\nwhence they had started, and rested there five days, the main body having\r\nmeanwhile come up with them. One attempt after another was made to pass\r\nthe half-way fort, but the Spaniards held their ground, and actually\r\ninflicted defeat in the open and a disgraceful rout upon the English, some\r\nof whose gallant officers threw their lives away in a vain attempt to lead\r\ntheir men. All the while this broken and demoralised mob was without\r\nproper supplies from the fleet, the officers of which were either unable\r\nto communicate with the land force or indifferent as to their duty. The\r\nstate of health on the 25th of April, some ten or twelve days after\r\nlanding, is thus described in a letter: “And the rains nightly pouring,\r\nwith fogs and dews along the river, so soaked our bodies with flux, and\r\nnone escaping that violence, that our freshment [by retreat to the river]\r\nproved a weakening instead of support.” Another letter of two days’ later\r\ndate (April 27) says: “The rains increasing, our men weakening, all even\r\nto death fluxing, the seamen aboard neglecting,--that forced us to eat all\r\nour troop horses.” An attempt was made to restore discipline; an officer\r\nof high rank was cashiered for a coward, his sword having been broken over\r\nhis head; a soldier was shot for desertion; some loose women in men’s\r\nclothes from Barbados were chastised, and a sharp look-out kept for other\r\ncamp-followers of the kind. At length it was decided by Venables and his\r\ncouncil that the attempt on San Domingo must be abandoned; probably it was\r\nseen that the Barbadian and St Christopher following was a fatal\r\nencumbrance at that stage, the more so as the rainy season was in\r\nprogress. By the third of May the whole expedition was re-embarked, the\r\nSpaniards making no attempt to harass the operation. The number reshipped\r\nis said to have been seventeen hundred short of that which landed three\r\nweeks before: a good many had fallen fighting, others were slain by the\r\nSpaniards or negroes in the woods, and some appear to have died of the\r\nflux. The attempt on St Domingo having failed it was decided to make a\r\ndescent on Jamaica, the least important of the Spanish Antilles. On the\r\npassage thither, Winslow, one of the three lay commissioners or\r\n“politicals” with the expedition, died “very suddenly of a fever.”\r\n\r\nOn May 10 the ships entered the bay of Caguya. Admiral Penn, being\r\nresolved not to repeat the mistake they had made at St Domingo, kept sail\r\non the ‘Martin’ galley until she was beached under the small fort of the\r\nPassage, at the head of the bay, so as to cover the debarkation with his\r\nguns. However, the few Spaniards living at the shore fled, and the whole\r\nforce, to the number of some 7000, was landed by midnight. Venables then\r\nreturned to his ship for his usual repose, leaving the men under arms all\r\nnight. Not until nine next day, by which hour the cool of the morning was\r\nlost, did the march begin to the capital, St Jago de la Vega (“St James of\r\nthe Plain”), situated on an elevation by the river Cobre, in the midst of\r\nan alluvial plain with an amphitheatre of hills behind it, some six miles\r\nfrom the place of landing. About two in the afternoon they came before the\r\ntown, and marched in that night: they found it empty, “nothing but bare\r\nwalls, bedsteads, chairs and cowhides.” The town is said to have had some\r\n1700 houses (too many for its population), two churches, two chapels, and\r\nan abbey; there all the Spaniards dwelt in ease and indolence, “having\r\ntheir slaves at their several small plantations, who constantly brought\r\nthem store of provisions and fruits.” In this great island there were but\r\nabout 3000 inhabitants, half of them, if not more, being slaves. There\r\nwere no manufactures or native commodities, except a very little sugar and\r\ncocoa. The four ships that came thither in a year traded generally for\r\nhides and tallow only.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish colony had removed as much of their property as they could in\r\ntheir first flight, and shortly sent their head men with their governor,\r\n“an old decrepid seignior full of the French disease” carried by two\r\nbearers in a hammock, to treat for their re-entry into the town. Venables\r\nwas afterwards much blamed for returning the politeness of the Spaniards;\r\nhe received their presents of fresh provisions and fruit, accepted their\r\npromises of a steady supply for his men, and gave them the free run of\r\ntheir own houses for a week or so, by which time they are said to have\r\ncarried off all their personal belongings of value. They objected to leave\r\nthe island, saying that Jamaica was their home, and that they had no\r\nfriends either in New Spain or in Old Spain. At length they left their old\r\nsettlement, with the avowed purpose of embarking for Cuba from a bay on\r\nthe same side to the west. There were divided counsels among the English\r\nas to the treatment of the Spaniards, and Colonel Bullard was sent towards\r\nthe bay with a large force to intercept them in their flight. They had,\r\nhowever, given a false direction, and had in reality crossed the mountains\r\nnorthwards to the other side of the island, clearing the country as they\r\nwent of cattle and produce of every kind. Some of them, including eight\r\nfamilies of the upper class, at length found their way to Cuba, but the\r\nlarger number remained on the north of the island, where they were\r\novertaken by famine and pestilence before a few months, and nearly\r\nexterminated. Their negroes took to the mountains, and became the\r\nmaroons, famous in the later history of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the Spaniards, the English troops went roaming over the\r\ncountry, destroying the hogs and cattle in mere wantonness, and leaving\r\ntheir carcases to putrefy. In a short time the multitude of English at St\r\nJago de la Vega (Spanish Town) were on short rations, and before long\r\n“dogs and cats the best part of their diet.” The stores from the ships had\r\nbeen left on the beach exposed to the weather, and soon turned mouldy, the\r\nmen refusing to carry them, in the absence of waggons, over the six miles\r\nbetween the shore and the head-quarters. Two or three victuallers besides\r\nhad arrived from England within a week or two of the first landing, but,\r\nfor all that, the expedition was starving. Many of the men were suffering\r\nfrom the flux which they had contracted in St Domingo. Venables, in a\r\nprivate letter of May 25, or a fortnight after landing, gives the number\r\nof the sick at near 3000; in a despatch to Cromwell, of June 4, he says:\r\n\r\n    “The want we have been in hitherto of bread (we not being able to be\r\n    suddenly supplied therewith out of the fleet, or our stores, through\r\n    want of waggons and other conveniences for the transportation\r\n    thereof), joined with the drinking of water, hath already cast both\r\n    officers and soldiers into such violent fluxes that they look more\r\n    like dead men crept out of their graves than persons living; and this\r\n    so generally that we have not above two colonels in health, three\r\n    majors, some seven field officers in all; besides many have been\r\n    already swept away with this disease. We lost Mr Winslow very\r\n    suddenly, in our sailing towards this island, of a fever.”\r\n\r\nOn June 9 there was a general muster of the land forces, “whose number was\r\nfound to be much diminished of late, not so much by any pestilential or\r\nviolent disease, as for mere want of natural sustenance; which, in common\r\nreason, may seem strange that of all men soldiers should starve in a\r\ncook’s shop, as the saying is[1185].”\r\n\r\nIn a despatch of June 13, Venables says that “about 2000 are sick. Our men\r\ndie daily, eating roots and fresh fish (when any food is got), without\r\nbread or very little.” He was himself ill, having had the flux for five\r\nweeks. Admiral Penn (father of the founder of Pennsylvania) had resolved\r\nto go home with two-thirds of the ships, thinking that his services were\r\nno longer needed, and having been advised that he could be of more service\r\nto Cromwell in England. He sailed on June 21, leaving the frigates and the\r\nDutch prizes, under Goodson; and Venables followed in four days, with the\r\nsurviving “political,” leaving the settlement in charge of Fortescue, who\r\nwrote home, “I am left to act without book.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cromwell had got ready reinforcements, sparing no trouble or\r\nexpense at home. The expedition in aid left Plymouth on July 11, 1655,\r\nunder the command of Sedgwick, and arrived at Barbados on August 26-31,\r\nafter a fine passage; they left again on September 7, having trimmed their\r\ncasks and taken in water with other refreshments. This force was in the\r\nbest of health until after leaving Barbados. Sedgwick writes:\r\n\r\n    “I think never so many ships sailed together with less trouble, grief\r\n    or danger than we did; only God did in a little visit us between this\r\n    [Jamaica] and Barbados with some sickness, I apprehend caused by some\r\n    distemper taken there [? yellow fever]; in which visitation, I think,\r\n    in the whole fleet we lost between 20 and 30 seamen and soldiers.”\r\n\r\nFinding the Spanish flag flying at San Domingo, they came on to Jamaica on\r\nOctober 1, and there found a calamitous state of things.\r\n\r\n    “For the army, I found them in as sad and deplorable and distracted\r\n    condition as can be thought of: commanders, some left them, some dead,\r\n    some sick, and some in indifferent health; the soldiery many dead,\r\n    their carcases lying unburied in the highways and among bushes, to and\r\n    again; many of them that were alive walked like ghosts or dead men,\r\n    who, as I went through the town, lay groaning and crying out, Bread,\r\n    for God’s sake!”\r\n\r\nSedgwick brought with him in four victuallers a thousand tons of\r\nprovisions, which he secured in a store built for the occasion on the\r\nbeach. Among his troops was Colonel Humphry’s regiment of 831 “lusty,\r\nhealthful, gallant men, who encouraged the whole army.” But now we begin\r\nto see that the sickness at St Jago de la Vega had become infective or\r\npestilential. The new-comers, healthy and well found as they were, began\r\nat once to sicken and to die. Of Humphry’s regiment, on November 5:\r\n\r\n    “There are at this day 50 of them dead, whereof two captains, a\r\n    lieutenant, and two ensigns, the colonel himself very weak, the\r\n    lieutenant-colonel at death’s door. Soldiers die daily, I believe 140\r\n    every week, and so have done ever since I came hither. It is strange\r\n    to see lusty men, in appearance well, and in three or four days in the\r\n    grave, snatched away in a moment with fevers, agues, fluxes and\r\n    dropsies, a confluence of many diseases. We furnished the army now\r\n    with 60 butts of Madeira wine, and to every regiment a butt of brandy,\r\n    and a hogshead or two of sweet oil. Our soldiers have destroyed all\r\n    sorts of fruits, and provisions and cattle. Nothing but ruin attends\r\n    them wherever they go.” On January 24, 1656, Sedgwick again writes to\r\n    Thurloe: “Did you but see the faces of this poor small army with us,\r\n    how like skeletons they look, it would move pity; and when I consider\r\n    the thousands laid in the dust in such a way as God hath visited, my\r\n    heart mourns. Here hath come down to us from many of the Windward\r\n    Islands divers people with intentions of sitting down with us, but at\r\n    their coming hither, either fall sick and die, or are so affrighted\r\n    and dismayed as that, although to their much impoverishing, yet will\r\n    not be persuaded to stay with us.”\r\n\r\nThe men in the fleet were in better health; but among them also “some die\r\nand some are sick, in so much that we need a good recruit fully to man our\r\nships as men-of-war.” On the same date (January 24, 1656) Admiral Goodson,\r\nwriting to Thurloe, estimates the surviving officers and men at 2600,\r\nbesides women and children; and in another despatch of that date from\r\nSedgwick and Goodson jointly to Cromwell it is stated:\r\n\r\n    “The numbers of the army are much lessened since our last letters\r\n    [November 5]; the whole not extending to 3000, many of them sick and\r\n    weak, the best and soundest much abated of their strength and vigor,\r\n    and God goes on every day to shorten our number. We die daily, not\r\n    less than fifty every week, which is much considering our small\r\n    numbers.”\r\n\r\nAs the season advanced the health of the troops on shore improved. A\r\nletter of March 12 says that the condition of the army is much mended; the\r\nsoldiers are far more healthful, but much dejected and averse to the\r\nplace. The fleet was in good spirits, and impatient for action; however,\r\nthere was sickness also on board the ships; they had lost some fourscore\r\nmen since the last despatch; and on April 30 the report is: “our seamen\r\nare indifferently well in health; yet some few are sick, and God is daily\r\nshortening them, so that our fleet will want a recruit of men.” Several of\r\nthe frigates were wormeaten, and careened for repairs. Sickness is\r\nreported in the ships as late as October 10, 1656.\r\n\r\nThe sickness among all ranks had been so general and severe that it was\r\nhardly possible to find senior officers to undertake the government.\r\nFortescue died in October, 1655, and was succeeded temporarily by D’Oyley\r\nand others, the sole government being at length given by Cromwell to\r\nSedgwick, who died a few days after receiving his unwelcome commission.\r\nBrayne, transferred from Lochaber to Jamaica, also died, and it fell at\r\nlength to D’Oyley, an effective person in whom all on the spot had\r\nconfidence, to carry the colony through its troubles. Cromwell spared no\r\neffort at home. Immense quantities of provisions were shipped; planters,\r\nwith their families, ‘servants’ and slaves, to the number of some 1700,\r\nwere removed to Jamaica from Nevis, under Stokes, the governor of that\r\nisland; the New Englanders were also encouraged to resort to the new\r\ncolony; and a thousand or so of young men and marriageable young women\r\nwere furnished from Ireland, together with pioneers, described as of a\r\nrougher kind, from Scotland. “And so at length,” says Carlyle, “a\r\nWest-Indian interest did take root; and bears spices and poisons, and\r\nother produce, to this day.”\r\n\r\nThe sickness and mortality among the first English colonists of Jamaica\r\ngave the island a bad name, and must have added not a little to the\r\nconfusion of ideas already existing as to the pestilent character of\r\ntropical climates[1186]. The older sugar-colonies, such as Barbados, which\r\nsaw in Jamaica a formidable competitor, would appear to have encouraged\r\nthe notion that climates varied much, that of Jamaica being bad. Soon\r\nafter the Restoration, Charles II. was urged to give back Jamaica to\r\nSpain, and is said to have seriously entertained that purpose. Among the\r\nstate papers is a document, supposed to have been written in November,\r\n1660, which sets forth the natural advantages of Jamaica, together with\r\ntwo sets of reasons why England should retain it[1187]:\r\n\r\n    “The air here is more temperate than in any of the Caribee Islands,\r\n    being more northerly and as sufferable hot as in many places.... The\r\n    winds here constantly all day blow easterly, so coolly that it renders\r\n    any labour sufferable at midday.... We find here is not such antipathy\r\n    between the constitution of the English and the climate that sickness\r\n    is not inevitable and contingent; for we have experimentally found\r\n    that persons observing a good diet and using moderate exercise, enjoy\r\n    a somewhat (?) measure of health. The said causes of the mortality of\r\n    the Army at their first arrival were want of provisions, unwillingness\r\n    to labour or exercise, and inexcusable discontent to be constrained to\r\n    stay here. The diseases that strangers are most incident to are\r\n    dropsies (occasioned often by evil diet and slothfulness), calentures\r\n    (so frequently produced of surfeit), and fevers and agues, which,\r\n    although very troublesome, are never mortal.... Cagway [Port Royal] is\r\n    the place where all the merchants reside, being the most healthy place\r\n    in the island; whither resort all the men that frequent the Indies,\r\n    which makes houses so dear that an ordinary house in this town is\r\n    worth £40 or £60 per annum. There are about 200 houses there, all\r\n    built by the English. About 50 houses have been built by the English\r\n    at the fort of the Passage [at the head of the harbour and the nearest\r\n    point to Spanish Town]; of the houses in the old capital, St Jago de\r\n    la Vega, about 800 are ruinous. As to the number of English in the\r\n    island, the relics of the six regiments do muster 2200, and it is\r\n    probable that the planters, merchants, sailors and others may be as\r\n    many.”\r\n\r\nThe above statements about the healthiness of Jamaica in 1660 were\r\nrepeated by Dr Trapham, in his work on the climate and diseases of the\r\ncolony in 1678[1188]. This earliest medical writer is, indeed, more\r\noptimist than those who followed him, as to contagious or infective\r\nsickness; there was no smallpox, or very rarely, saving sometimes brought\r\nfrom Guinea by negroes; and “no depopulating plague that ere I have heard\r\nof,” saving a pestilential fever brought in by the victorious fleet\r\nreturned from the signal Panama expedition in 1670. The experiences of\r\nyellow fever at Port Royal and Kingston were mostly, if not entirely,\r\nsubsequent to these dates. But, as there had been yellow fever at\r\nBarbados, St Christopher, and Guadeloupe as early as 1647-48, it has been\r\nthought probable that the enormous mortality in Jamaica in 1655-56 was\r\nfrom the same endemic cause[1189] Undoubtedly the epidemic at Spanish Town\r\nbecame at length more than the dysentery which had been brought by some of\r\nthe troops from San Domingo, or had been induced among others of them by\r\nbad food and water; it became a virulent specific infection, attacking the\r\nhealthy and well-found reinforcements from England and the new arrivals\r\nfrom the Windward Islands, and destroying them quickly, “in three or four\r\ndays.” Fevers are specially named, as well as fluxes and dropsies; and the\r\nquestion arises whether the pestilential fever was not yellow fever.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing said of the striking and ghastly symptoms of\r\nthe _vomito negro_. Moreover the sickness was nearly all at the town of St\r\nJago de la Vega, six miles from the bay, situated on a rising of the plain\r\nwith a declivity to the Cobre river, a place which was only exceptionally\r\nthe seat of yellow fever in after-experience. Thus Judge Long, the able\r\nhistorian of Jamaica, says[1190]:\r\n\r\n    “After a series of hot, dry, and calm weather, eight days of continued\r\n    rain succeeded in May, 1761. Spanish Town grew more sickly than ever I\r\n    knew it, either before or since. From that period to August there were\r\n    buried 29 white inhabitants, of whom 15 were soldiers. Their disorder\r\n    had all the appearance of being the true yellow fever, and was\r\n    supposed to have been communicated from some ship in Kingston\r\n    harbour:”\r\n\r\n--Kingston and Port Royal, or the ships moored near to them, being the\r\ncommon habitat of the disease, as in the corresponding circumstances at\r\nother West Indian islands.\r\n\r\nBut if the infective fever at Spanish Town in 1655-56 was almost certainly\r\nnot yellow fever, it was probably allied to it in type. Dysentery had\r\nbeen almost universal; there was no care of the sick, and, so far as one\r\nhears, no medical attendance, no hospitals, no scavenging, no security\r\ntaken to keep the water-supply pure--nothing, in short, of what is now\r\ncalled sanitation. Sedgwick, arriving on October 1, 1655, found even the\r\ndead unburied by the highways and among the bushes. The correlation\r\nbetween dysentery and pestilential fever is no new hypothesis: flux first\r\nand fever afterwards has been an experience both in sieges and in ordinary\r\ndomestic famines on many occasions. The origin of the yellow fever at\r\nBarbados and elsewhere in 1647-8, which has been outlined in this chapter,\r\nis but a special application of the same principle, the dysenteric matters\r\nwhich represent the crude source of the infection having been brought in\r\nthe bilges and ballast of slave-ships, thrown into the mud of almost\r\ntideless harbours, left to ferment amidst the heat and moisture of the\r\nshore, and so made into a soil-poison which, in due season, would give off\r\nemanations, fatal especially to new-comers. Port Royal and Kingston had\r\nfull experience of that endemic influence in after-years, for the first\r\ntime in 1692, after the earthquake and disturbance of soil which destroyed\r\nthe former town and occasioned the building of the latter on the other\r\nside of the bay. By that time there had been slavers enough in the bay to\r\nbring all the ordure that the hypothesis requires. But, down to 1655, the\r\nSpaniards had traded only with hides and tallow in some four ships every\r\nyear, and had the headquarters of their cultivation and stock-raising at\r\nthe town in the plain some six miles from the shore. Four or five years\r\nafter their expulsion we find the whole aspect of the port changed,\r\naccording to the description already given. It does not appear that\r\nCromwell looked forward to negro labour in his colony, although the Nevis\r\nplanters brought their blacks with them. Charles II. had not been many\r\nmonths on the throne when James, earl of Marlborough, petitioned him to\r\noffer inducements to the Royal African Company to make Jamaica the staple\r\nfor the sale of blacks, and to contract with that company for one hundred\r\nnegroes to be delivered at the island[1191]. Negroes did begin from that\r\ntime to arrive in Jamaica, although Port Royal was at first rather a\r\ngeneral centre of commerce and piracy than a slave-port like Bridgetown,\r\nperhaps because the Windward Islands were strong enough to keep their\r\nprivileges undivided. As late as 1670 the negro slaves in Jamaica were\r\nreckoned at no more than 2500, not counting the old Spanish maroons[1192].\r\nOn September 20 of that year, Sir Thomas Modyford, governor of Jamaica,\r\nsent to Secretary Arlington certain proposals for the improvement of the\r\ncolony, of which the following bears upon our subject[1193]:\r\n\r\n    “That they may have licence gratis or at moderate rates to trade for\r\n    negroes in Africa. Did those honourable persons, which make that Royal\r\n    [African] Company so glorious, but fall into considerations how much\r\n    more it is his Majesty’s interest to increase the number of his\r\n    subjects than bullion of gold or silver (which by law all nations may\r\n    import), they would not only freely consent to this proposal for us\r\n    but for the whole nation and foreigners also. Mankind is the\r\n    principal, gold the accessory: increase the first considerably, and\r\n    the other must follow. Barbados had never risen to its late perfection\r\n    had it not been lawful for Dutch, Hamburghers, and our whole nation,\r\n    and any other, to bring and sell their blacks or any other servants in\r\n    the colony’s infancy.”\r\n\r\nThe harbours of Port Royal and Kingston did, in the event, become the\r\nchief resort of slave-ships in the British West Indies, slaves having been\r\nlanded there up to ten thousand in a year throughout the 18th century.\r\nThey came also to be among the chief seats of yellow fever, and continued\r\nso until a recent date. The subsequent progress of yellow fever there, and\r\nin other West Indian harbours as well as in the ports of some of the North\r\nAmerican colonies, is not the least important of the subjects that fall to\r\nthe second period of this history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON, AND THE LAST OF PLAGUE IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature of the Great Plague.\r\n\r\nThe writings called forth directly by the London Plague of 1665 were\r\nhardly more numerous or of better quality than those of 1603 and 1625. At\r\nits beginning in June, or in August, there appeared a number of tracts by\r\nenterprising practitioners, containing a few commonplace remarks on causes\r\nand the like, and advertisements of nostrums--by G. Harvey, Kemp,\r\nGarrencieres (“Plague is one of the easiest diseases in the world to cure,\r\nif” etc.), and Gadbury, an astrologer. The directions drawn up by the\r\nCollege of Physicians in 1636, for the preservation of the sound and\r\nrecovery of the sick were re-issued, and an excellent set of “cautionary\r\nrules” by H. Brooke was published by order of the mayor. The writings\r\nwhich contain accounts of the Great Plague fall under two periods--the\r\nyears immediately following 1665, and the years 1720 to 1723 when there\r\nwas a sudden revival of interest in the subject in London owing to the\r\ngreat plague of Marseilles in 1720. To the latter period belongs the most\r\nfamous work on the plague of 1665, Defoe’s _Journal of the Plague Year_,\r\nwhich embodied in a picturesque form the substance of various writings\r\nthat preceded it, together with traditions known to Defoe. A brief account\r\nof those writings that preceded Defoe’s in both periods will serve at the\r\nsame time to show the sources of a great part of his information.\r\n\r\nThe weekly bills of mortality issued by Parish Clerks’ Hall, which showed\r\nthe number of deaths week by week in each of the one hundred and forty\r\nparishes of London, with a rough classification of the causes of death,\r\nwere reprinted at the end of the year 1665 in a volume with the title\r\n_London’s Dreadful Visitation_[1194]. The bills thus collected in\r\nconvenient form were made great use of by Defoe, and became, indeed, the\r\nbackbone of his work. Next to them in importance, although it is not\r\ncertain that Defoe used it, is a treatise on the medical aspects of the\r\nGreat Plague, which has never had the fortune to be published. The author\r\nof it was William Boghurst, a young apothecary practising at the White\r\nHart in St Giles’s-in-the-Fields, who advertised in the _Intelligencer_ on\r\nJuly 31, 1665, at the height of the plague in his parish, that he had\r\ntreated forty, fifty or sixty patients in a day, that he was prepared to\r\nundertake the treatment of cases in the City, the suburbs, or the country,\r\nand that he had a water, a lozenge, and an electuary, as well as an\r\nantidote at eightpence an ounce[1195].\r\n\r\nAfter the epidemic was over he employed his spare half-hours in writing a\r\nbook upon his experiences, “considering that none hath printed anything\r\neither since this plague, or that forty years since--which I something\r\nwonder at.” He professes to have taken nothing from hearsay, or from\r\nbooks, or from the testimonies of others; he writes in English “for\r\ngeneral readers and sale,” and he had omitted many things “so as not to\r\nmake the book too tedious and too dear to bie.” The manuscript was\r\ncompleted for the press, with a title-page, at the foot of which is what\r\nappears to be a publisher’s name (the surname now torn off); but it was\r\nnever published, although the author lived until 1685. It is conceivable\r\nthat the printed sheets, or the composed type, may have been destroyed in\r\nthe fire of September, 1666, and the enterprise abandoned. The manuscript\r\ncame into the possession of Sir Hans Sloane, and is now in the British\r\nMuseum[1196]. It gives much fuller clinical details of the plague than any\r\nother English work, although in somewhat aphoristic form; and it may be\r\nallowed the character of originality which the author claims for it,\r\nexcept in some of the more systematic chapters showing the influence of\r\nDiemerbroek.\r\n\r\nAnother medical essay following the plague was that of Dr Hodges, of\r\nWatling Street, first written in English in 1666 (May 8) under the title\r\n_A Letter to a Person of Quality_[1197], and expanded in 1671 into a Latin\r\ntreatise[1198]. Besides a few pages at the beginning, giving some general\r\nfacts of the London outbreak (which Defoe used), it is mostly a systematic\r\ndisquisition, although a few cases are interspersed. One other medical\r\npiece of 1666 (June 16) is known, by Dr George Thomson, of Duke’s Place\r\nnear Aldgate, a Paracelsist or chemical physician; it contains the account\r\nof a dissection of a plague-body, but is mostly occupied with a polemic\r\nagainst the Galenists, which the author carried on for a number of years\r\nin numerous other writings[1199].\r\n\r\nDescriptive pieces, in prose or verse, such as the plagues of 1603 and\r\n1625 elicited, are entirely wanting for that of 1665. But there was the\r\nusual crop of religious and moral exercises to improve the occasion. These\r\nappear to have come mostly, if not exclusively, from Dissenters. “Many\r\nuseful and pious treatises,” says a Dissenter in 1721, “were published\r\nupon the occasion of the last visitation, as by Mr Zach. Crofton, Mr Shaw,\r\nMr Doolittle, and others.” But the only one that attained popularity,\r\nhaving gone through five editions at once, and been often reprinted, even\r\nas late as 1851, was _God’s Terrible Voice in the City_[1200], by the Rev.\r\nThomas Vincent, of Christ Church, Oxford, who had been ejected from his\r\nliving of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, and was then a leader of Dissent.\r\nVincent preached in several parish churches (deserted by their parsons)\r\nall through the plague, and ministered constantly among the sick. His\r\nbook, which moralizes also upon the great fire of 1666, will be drawn upon\r\nin the sequel.\r\n\r\nWe come next to the revival of interest in the Great Plague of London,\r\nwhich was occasioned by the Marseilles epidemic in the summer of 1720, an\r\nevent that alarmed Western Europe as if the old recurrences of plague were\r\nabout to begin afresh after a long interval. In London, in 1721, several\r\nbooks were published upon the Marseilles plague itself; and the years from\r\n1720 to 1722 saw a whole crop of writings,--new essays and reprints of old\r\nones,--upon the last London plague of 1665. Among the books reprinted were\r\nHodges’ _Loimologia_, in an English translation by Quincy, his _Letter to\r\na Person of Quality_, the _Necessary Directions_ of the College of\r\nPhysicians, the _Orders drawn up by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the\r\nCity_ (these three in 1721 in a _Collection of very Valuable and Scarce\r\nPieces relating to the last Plague in 1665_), and Vincent’s _God’s\r\nTerrible Voice in the City_. The new medical books on the Great Plague\r\nwere by Scarborough, Hancock and Browne.\r\n\r\nWhen Defoe in 1722 wrote his _Journal of the Plague Year_, he had these\r\nrecent reprints and original books convenient to his hand. He had to go\r\nback to 1665 for the collection of the weekly bills of mortality in the\r\nplague-year (in a volume called _London’s Dreadful Visitation_), and he\r\nmay have consulted Boghurst’s manuscript, which was probably then in the\r\npossession of Sir Hans Sloane. But it is impossible to trace all his\r\ncopious narrative of the Great Plague to these sources, even if we make\r\ndue allowance for his legitimate construction of incidents out of the\r\ngeneralities of contemporary writers. It is possible that he may have had\r\nsome unknown manuscript, less technical than Boghurst’s, to draw from. At\r\nall events, he was a likely person to have had many stories of the plague\r\nin his memory. He was a child of four when the plague was in London, the\r\nson of a butcher named Foe in St Giles’s, Cripplegate, which was one of\r\nthe most severely visited parishes. The most graphic parts of his\r\n_Journal_ are those which contain such tales as he might have been told in\r\nboyhood concerning the plague in Cripplegate, the scene of them being\r\ncarried round to Aldgate, opposite to the Butchers’ Row (still there) in\r\nWhitechapel High Street. He must have had some testimony from which to\r\nconstruct the visit to Blackwall, the view of the shipping moored all up\r\nand down the Thames, and the other particulars of the river-side\r\npopulation in the plague-time. The rough experiences of the three Stepney\r\nmen in the country near London are in the manner of _Robinson Crusoe_, and\r\nneeded only a few hints from Dekker’s stories, or from the writers of\r\n1625. His account of the burials by the cart-load in plague-pits is also\r\nsuggestive of Dekker. The somewhat meagre references by Hodges might have\r\nsufficed him for his frequent theme of the hardships and horrors of\r\nshut-up houses, even if he had not seen two other tracts, of 1665, on the\r\nsame. The accounts of the Marseilles plague, one of the worst in history,\r\nwould have kept him right in picturing that of London.\r\n\r\nWhatever materials Defoe took from Hodges, Vincent, or the writers on\r\nother plagues, he enlarged them by his power of circumstantial\r\nconstruction into a narrative which must be accounted on the whole\r\nveracious. He based upon figures, whenever he could get them; he seems\r\neven to have sought among the archives of the City for accounts of monies\r\ndistributed to the poor. He prints in full the orders of the Mayor and\r\nAldermen, and professes to give the text of a formal resolution which they\r\npassed to remain at their posts throughout the crisis. His table of the\r\nnumber of plague-deaths in each of twenty-six towns or villages near\r\nLondon does not, indeed, agree with the figures in the parish registers,\r\nas the table on a later page will show; but it can hardly have been drawn\r\nup at a guess.\r\n\r\nThe best instance of Defoe’s skilful use of authentic documents is his\r\ndescription of how the infection invaded one part of London after another\r\nfrom the western suburbs to the eastern, so that its intensity was nearly\r\nover in one place before it had begun in another. That is the most\r\ninteresting epidemiological fact in the whole outbreak; and Defoe has done\r\nample justice to it. Boghurst had stated it with equal clearness and\r\nemphasis in his manuscript of 1666, which Defoe may or may not have\r\nseen[1201]; however the latter deduced it afresh, and illustrated it by\r\nnumerous tables from the bills of mortality, which showed the incidence of\r\nplague upon each of the one hundred and forty parishes from week to week.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntecedents, Beginnings and Progress of the Plague of 1665.\r\n\r\nWhen the London plague of 1665 had given indications that it would grow to\r\nbe one of the great outbreaks of that infection, much was made, in the\r\nretrospect, of a single death from plague which had occurred towards the\r\nend of December, 1664, in a house in or near Long Acre. Connected with\r\nthat case was one of those trivial chains of evidence which are so often\r\nproduced as the easy solution of a difficult problem. A bale of silks had\r\ncome to the house from Holland, and that bale of silks could be traced to\r\nthe Levant; therefore the seeds of the great plague of London were\r\nimported Levantine seeds. This was pretty well for a city which had a\r\ncontinuous record of plague-infection in its soil ever since the Black\r\nDeath of 1348. But credulity could ignore facts more recent than the\r\nhistory for three centuries. The death in Long Acre in December was a\r\nsolitary one, and was of no more import for what followed than any of the\r\nfive other sporadic plague-deaths in 1664[1202]. Only one more death from\r\nplague occurred in the bills (in the middle of February), until the last\r\nweek of April, 1665; even then the progress of the infection was slower\r\nfor the next two months than it had been in many former seasons of\r\nmoderate plague, such as the five years 1606-1610 and the eight years\r\n1640-1647, or than it had been in the great plague-years of 1603, 1625 and\r\n1636. An importation from abroad had been alleged as early as the great\r\nplague of 1563, namely from Havre, which was then held by an English\r\ngarrison. But on that occasion the epidemic in London was gaining ground\r\nbefore the sickness at Havre had declared itself plague, and was of the\r\nbubonic type while the latter was still a malignant fever. The return of\r\nthe whole English garrison from Havre, with the seeds of sickness among\r\nthem, might well have introduced infection; but that return was not until\r\nthe end of July, by which time the mortality in London had been\r\nprogressing for two months. There is equally little reason for Stow’s\r\nstatement that the plague of 1603 was brought to London from Ostend, or\r\nfor the corresponding theory of origin for the plague of 1625. A foreign\r\nsource was not thought of unless the plague became one of the greater\r\ndegree. Year after year in London there were a few cases of plague, and\r\nsometimes for a succession of years the plague-deaths kept steadily at a\r\nlevel of from one thousand to three thousand. There are, indeed, few years\r\nfrom 1348 to 1666 in which the infection did not declare its presence in\r\nLondon. Whether the few threatening cases in the spring were to rise to a\r\nplague of the greater degree depended upon a concurrence of\r\ncircumstances--upon the interval since the last great plague, upon the\r\nnumber of strangers crowding to the capital, and upon the kind of weather\r\npreceding. In 1665 the various determining things did chance to come\r\ntogether, and a plague of the first degree ensued. The one singular thing\r\nin the history is that such a concurrence never happened again, or that\r\nthe conditions had so far changed (certainly not for the better), that\r\nthe type of epidemic disease was no longer the bubo-plague.\r\n\r\nAccording to precedent, a great plague was somewhat overdue in the year\r\n1665. Its two great predecessors (not reckoning the smaller plague of\r\n1636) had happened each at the beginning of a new reign--in 1603 on the\r\naccession of James I., and in 1625 on the accession of Charles I. The\r\nRestoration of 1660 was the time for the next great outburst; but that was\r\ndelayed for five years. Those five years were occupied with a good deal of\r\nfever and other infective disease in London, and the fever in the\r\nbeginning of 1665 was, according to Sydenham, of a marked pestilential\r\ntype. It may be said to have led up to the plague; but the bubonic disease\r\nitself needed something in addition to the determining causes of spotted\r\nfever. It is generally admitted that London was unusually crowded with the\r\npoorer classes whose work is required by the luxury of the rich (Defoe\r\nsays that an enumeration for the Lord Mayor had made out 100,000\r\nribbon-weavers in the eastern suburbs, although the number is incredible).\r\nThere was also a general relaxation of morals, which may have predisposed\r\nmany constitutions to receive the seeds of infection. Another element in\r\nthe case was the weather.\r\n\r\nThe summer before had been remarkable for the immense number of\r\nhouse-flies, and of other insects and frogs. From November to the end of\r\nMarch the earth was held in almost continual black frost. Boghurst says\r\nthe wind was westerly for seven months. No rain fell all the time except a\r\nslight sprinkling in the end of April. The dry cold continued after the\r\nfrost broke, and produced, says Sydenham, an unusual number of cases of\r\npleurisy, pneumonia and angina. Richard Baxter says of the seasons\r\npreceding the great plague, that they were “the driest winter, spring and\r\nsummer that ever man alive knew, or our forefathers ever heard of; so that\r\nthe grounds were burnt like the highways, the meadow ground where I lived\r\n[Acton] having but four loads of hay which before bare forty[1203].” The\r\nhay crop was “pitiful,” says Boghurst, in consequence of the long cold and\r\ndrought. But the summer was made pleasant by refreshing breezes, and\r\nthere was abundance of all kinds of grain, vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the beginning of June that the deaths from plague in all\r\nLondon, according to the bills of mortality, reached the sum of 43 in the\r\nweek. But the mortality had been excessive from the beginning of the year,\r\nand it was suspected, as in the like circumstances in 1625, that the\r\nsearchers had been concealing the existence of plague, or calling cases of\r\nit by other names, so as to save the infected houses from being shut up.\r\nThe motive for bribery and concealment doubtless existed; it had been kept\r\nin view by the authorities from the first institution of searchers, who\r\nwere solemnly sworn before the Dean of the Arches to make a true return of\r\nthe cause of death. In all the great plagues, less so in 1563 and 1603\r\nthan in other years, there was reason to suppose that a large proportion\r\nof deaths put down to other causes than plague were really cases of\r\nplague. However there is no doubt that, in the early months of 1665, just\r\nas in the beginning of 1625, there was a great deal of spotted fever in\r\nLondon, not to mention smallpox and dysentery. The season was a sickly\r\none, such a sickly season as often occurred in the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century and throughout the whole of the eighteenth, when there\r\ncould be no longer any question of plague. The weekly bills contain\r\nnumerous deaths in the several parishes from “fever” and from “spotted\r\nfever” for months before they contain more than an occasional\r\nplague-death. There was no reason why these and other maladies should not\r\nhave swelled the bills to three or four hundred in a week; in the year\r\n1739, when London was probably not a third larger than in 1665, Strother\r\nsays that fever brought the weekly bill up to near a thousand. It is\r\nremarkable, however, that Boghurst claims to have been treating cases of\r\nplague from the month of November, 1664; Hodges also says that he was\r\ncalled in the middle of the Christmas holidays to a young man in a fever\r\nwho acquired, two days after, a plague-botch in each groin as large as a\r\nnutmeg, and recovered. Boghurst admits that “tokens,” by which he means\r\nthe marks of plague other than the botch or bubo, “appeared not much till\r\nabout the middle of June, and carbuncles not till the latter end of July.”\r\nHe suspects that the bills of mortality did not tell the whole truth;\r\nand, as an instance of evasion, he says that there had been plague in St\r\nGiles’s, St Martin’s, St Clement’s, and St Paul’s, Covent Garden, for\r\nthree or four years before (the bills of mortality give only 12, 9, and 5\r\ndeaths respectively for all London in the years 1662, 1663 and 1664), “as\r\nI have been certainly informed by the people themselves that had it in\r\ntheir houses in those parishes.”\r\n\r\nBut, in claiming an earlier beginning for the plague than the bills\r\nrecognize, and in setting aside the diagnosis of fever as insufficient,\r\nBoghurst takes what is known, in the controversies upon the nature and\r\naffinities of plague, as the “ontological” view: that is to say, he sees\r\nin plague a fixed and uniform entity, and he sees the same in fever. The\r\nother view is the developmental, which recognizes transitions from the one\r\ntype of pestilential disease into the other. The great writers of the\r\ntime, Willis, Sydenham, and Morton, were none of them “ontologists.” They\r\nall taught the scale of malignity, which had simple continued fever at one\r\nend, then a severer fever with spots and “parotids,” then a fever with\r\nbuboes, and at the farthest end of the scale the true plague, with its\r\nbuboes, carbuncles, and tokens. Nor is it denied by competent observers,\r\nsuch as Boghurst himself, that an epidemic of plague declined as a whole\r\nin malignity towards the end, so that the buboes suppurated, and three out\r\nof four, or three out of five, patients recovered. If that were the case\r\nin the descent of the curve, why should there not have been something\r\ncorresponding in the ascent? If certain cases of the prevailing fever in\r\nthe beginning of the year developed buboes which suppurated (as in the\r\ncase treated by Hodges at Christmas, 1664), should they be called plague\r\nor fever? Willis would have answered in favour of fever, until such time,\r\nat least, as the “epidemic constitution” of the season changed definitely\r\nto plague[1204]; he does in effect answer so in the particular instance\r\nof the Oxford fever of 1643, which in some cases was bubonic, whereas, in\r\n1645, he makes no doubt that the disease prevailing in Oxford and\r\nWallingford was true plague.\r\n\r\nThe more general discussion of this theme will be found in the concluding\r\nsection of the chapter on the Black Death, where illustrations are given\r\nof typhus fever turning to bubonic fever and to plague, from recent and\r\nanomalous outbreaks of plague in Arab villages or encampments, in some\r\nIndian villages, and elsewhere. The conclusion there come to was that the\r\ntype of plague, or the bubonic type, prevailed when the infection of the\r\nfilthy habitations began with change of season to rise from the soil,\r\nwhereas the form of sickness was typhus fever so long as the infection was\r\nprimarily in the atmosphere of the dwellings.\r\n\r\nWe may admit, then, that there was some ambiguity in the naming and\r\nclassifying of pestilential cases in the early months of 1665. If we\r\nfollow the bills--and there is nothing else to follow--the plague-deaths\r\nin all the parishes of London for the seven weeks from April 18 to June 6\r\nwere respectively no more than 2, 0, 9, 3, 14, 17 and 43, the deaths from\r\n“fever” and “spotted fever” being much more numerous.\r\n\r\nHaving thus far determined the date of beginning, we come next to the line\r\nof advance of the plague of 1665. It was from the western and northern\r\nsuburbs towards the City, the eastern suburbs, and Southwark. Boghurst,\r\nwho practised in St Giles’s-in-the-Fields, says:\r\n\r\n    “The plague fell first upon the highest ground, for our parish is the\r\n    highest ground about London, and the best air, and was first infected.\r\n    Highgate, Hampstead and Acton also all shared in it.” From the west\r\n    end of the town, Boghurst continues, “it gradually insinuated and\r\n    crept down Holborn and the Strand, and then into the City, and at last\r\n    to the east end of the suburbs, so that it was half a year at the west\r\n    end of the city [in his experience] before the east end and Stepney\r\n    was infected, which was about the middle of July. Southwark, being the\r\n    south suburb, was infected almost as soon as the west end.” But the\r\n    same writer farther explains that “it fell upon several places of the\r\n    city and suburbs like rain--at the first at St Giles’, St Martin’s,\r\n    Chancery-lane, Southwark, Houndsditch, and some places within the\r\n    City, as at Proctor’s-houses.”\r\n\r\nThe slow progress from west to east has been made much of by Defoe, who\r\nused the bills of mortality to ascertain the rise of the infection in the\r\nseveral districts. His conclusion is the same in the main as Boghurst’s\r\ncontemporary observation; only that he makes the infection of Southwark\r\nlater, and with reason so far as the bills show:--\r\n\r\n    “It was now mid-July, and the plague which had chiefly raged at the\r\n    other end of the town, and as I said before, in the parishes of St\r\n    Giles’s, St Andrew’s, Holbourn, and towards Westminster, began now to\r\n    come eastward towards the part where I lived. It was to be observed,\r\n    indeed, that it did not come straight on toward us; for the City, that\r\n    is to say within the walls, was indifferent healthy still; nor was it\r\n    got then very much over the water into Southwark; for though there\r\n    died that week 1268 of all distempers, whereof it might be supposed\r\n    above 900 died of the plague [only 725 in the bill], yet there was but\r\n    28 in the whole City within the walls, and but 19 in Southwark,\r\n    Lambeth included; whereas in the parishes of St Giles’ and St Martin’s\r\n    in the Fields alone, there died 421.... We perceived, I say, the\r\n    distemper to draw our way; viz. by the parishes of Clerkenwell,\r\n    Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two parishes\r\n    joining to Aldgate, Whitechapel and Stepney, the infection came at\r\n    length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts, even\r\n    when it abated at the western parishes where it began. It was very\r\n    strange to observe that in this particular week, from the 4th to the\r\n    13th July, when, as I have observed, there died near 400 of the plague\r\n    in the two parishes of St Martin’s and St Giles’ in the Fields only,\r\n    there died in the parish of Aldgate but four, in the parish of\r\n    Whitechapel three, and in the parish of Stepney but one.” In the\r\n    following week of July, with a total of 1761 deaths, whereof of the\r\n    plague 1089, only 16 occurred on the Southwark side. Soon, however,\r\n    Cripplegate had the infection at its hottest, and at the same time\r\n    Clerkenwell, St Sepulchre’s parish, St Bride’s and Aldersgate. “While\r\n    it was in all these parishes, the City and the parishes of the\r\n    Southwark side of the water, and all Stepney, Whitechapel, Aldgate,\r\n    Wapping and Ratcliff were very little touched; so that people went\r\n    about their business unconcerned, carried on their trades, kept open\r\n    their shops, and conversed freely with one another in all the City,\r\n    the east and north-east suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as if the\r\n    plague had not been among us.”\r\n\r\nIn another passage Defoe brings out the moral of its gradual advance. He\r\nhad shown\r\n\r\n    “how it began at one end of the town, and proceeded gradually and\r\n    slowly from one part to another; and like a dark cloud that passes\r\n    over our heads, which as it thickens and overcasts the air at one\r\n    end, clears up at the other end: so while the plague went on raging\r\n    from west to east, as it went forwards east it abated in the west, by\r\n    which means those parts of the town which were not seized, or who were\r\n    left, and where it had spent its fury were, as it were, spared to help\r\n    and assist the other; whereas had the distemper spread itself all over\r\n    the City and suburbs at once, raging in all places alike, as it has\r\n    done since in some places abroad, the whole body of the people must\r\n    have been overwhelmed” etc.\r\n\r\nThat is how Defoe constructs a concrete picture from the dry statistics of\r\nthe weekly bills. He has defined the stages, and pointed the moral, with a\r\nfirmer hand than the reality would most likely have warranted. But no\r\nscientific writer could have apprehended more correctly the general fact\r\nof a gradual invasion from the west end of the town.\r\n\r\nThese striking facts of the gradual advance of the Great Plague of London\r\nfrom west to east will be found to suit that theory of the plague-virus\r\nwhich has been illustrated in various parts of this volume. The virus of\r\nplague is a soil-poison, or the ground is its habitat; its quiescence or\r\nactivity depends upon whether or not the state of the soil favours the\r\nfermentation of the special organic matters therein, which special organic\r\nmatters we here take to be the products of cadaveric decomposition. The\r\nconclusion that the poison of plague lay in the soil, and that it rose\r\ninto the air in emanations or effluvia, was forced upon all those who\r\nthought much about the matter from the medieval period onwards. Thus, the\r\napothecary Boghurst, says in his first chapter: “And therefore my opinion\r\nfalls in wholly with those who make the earth the seminary and seed-plot\r\nof these venomous vapours and pestiferous effluvia, which vitiate and\r\ncorrupt the air, and consequently induce the pestilence.” And again: “The\r\nplague is a most subtle, insinuating, venomous, deleterious exhalation,\r\narising from the maturation of the ferment of the forces (?) of the earth,\r\nextracted into the air by the heat of the sun.” It is true that Boghurst,\r\nlike the sixteenth-century writers abroad, such as Ambroise Parè, locates\r\nthe venom in mysterious cavities and bowels of the earth, and dwells upon\r\nthe agency of earthquakes in setting it free. But he comes to more\r\nordinary causes in his enumeration of favouring things--“dunghills,\r\nexcrements, dead bodies lying unburied, putrefying churchyards too full,”\r\nand again “breaking up tombs and graves where dead bodies have been long\r\nburied.” As telling against the last, however, he adds: “When the\r\ncharnel-house at St Paul’s was demolished, there was a thousand cart-loads\r\nof dead men’s bones carried away to Finsbury, yet no plague followed it.”\r\n\r\nThe activity of this soil-poison depends upon processes in the soil which\r\ngo on so slowly that the link of cause and effect is easily overlooked. In\r\nthe last resort, they are dependent on the rise and fall of the\r\nground-water. It was observed beyond all doubt as the law in Lower Egypt,\r\nthat the plague came forth annually after the Nile had begun to fall, and\r\nthat it reached its height in the months of March, April and May, when the\r\nsoil was driest, or the pores of the ground occupied solely by air after\r\nhaving been full of water. It was observed, also, that the plague-area and\r\nthe inundation-area were co-extensive. Lower Egypt is, of course, somewhat\r\npeculiar (Lower Bengal coming near to it) in these regular alternations of\r\nair alone and water alone in the pores of the ground. But other countries\r\nhave the same sharp contrast occasionally, and London had the contrast\r\nvery decidedly in the years 1664 and 1665. The months from November 1664\r\nto June 1665, some of which ought to have brought snow or rain to raise\r\nthe wells and springs to their highest periodic water-mark early in the\r\nyear, were quite remarkable for drought: Richard Baxter says that no one\r\nremembered the like. The ground-water, instead of rising all through the\r\nwinter, must have fallen lower and lower as the spring and summer\r\nadvanced. The pores of the ground had been occupied with air to an unusual\r\ndepth of the subsoil, and the presence of air in these circumstances had\r\ngiven occasion to that ferment-activity in the special organic matters of\r\nan old-inhabited soil which produced the virus of plague. The stratum of\r\nsubsoil would become dry first in the more elevated parts; and as the\r\nground-water continued to fall, the air would reach in due course an\r\nunwonted stratum in the lower situations. Defoe says that they came to\r\nwater at eighteen feet in digging the Whitechapel plague-pits. The same\r\nseasonal march of a soil-infection from the higher ground to the lower\r\nhas been observed in modern times in other cities, and in other diseases\r\nthan plague. The drought for seven months from November to June would not,\r\nof itself, have caused a great plague. But it was an essential member of\r\nthe co-operating group of things; and it probably determined of itself the\r\nseason when the great plague was once more to come and take away the\r\nenormous increase of poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\nMortality and Incidents of the Great Plague.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 1665 was justly called the Great Plague, and is sometimes\r\nspoken of as “the plague of London,” as if it were unique. But it was not\r\nmuch more severe than those of 1603 and 1625 had been for the London of\r\ntheir generation; and there had been many plagues when London was a small\r\ncapital, such as those of 1407, 1479, 1500, 1513 and 1563, which had cut\r\noff as large a proportion (one-fifth to one-sixth) of the population. The\r\ninhabitants in 1665 were not far short of half a million, nearly twice as\r\nmany as in 1603, and about a third more than in 1625. The increased\r\nmortality in 1665 was somewhat more than proportionate to the increase of\r\ninhabitants, as the following table shows:--\r\n\r\n                                              Highest\r\n  Year    Estimated     Total     Plague     mortality      Worst\r\n          population    deaths    deaths     in a week      week\r\n\r\n  1603     250,000      42,940    33,347       3385       25 Aug.-1 Sept.\r\n  1625     320,000      63,001    41,313       5205       11-18 Aug.\r\n  1665     460,000      97,306    68,596       8297       12-19 Sept.\r\n\r\nReckoned from the christenings and burials in the bills of Parish Clerks’\r\nHall, the population in 1605 would have been 224,275, and in 1622,\r\n272,207. But in those years (and until after 1636) certain of the newer\r\nparishes (known as the Seven Parishes), including Stepney and Westminster,\r\nkept separate bills, of which some figures for 1603 and 1625 are given at\r\np. 477 and p. 511. The population of the Seven Parishes appears to have\r\nbeen about one-ninth of the whole metropolis in 1603, and about\r\none-seventh in 1625, while Graunt, a contemporary, makes it one-fifth in\r\n1662. These fractions have been added in the table, so as to make 1603\r\nand 1625 comparable with 1665. In 1603 and 1625, the highest mortality in\r\na week does not show the deaths in those parishes (Westminster, Stepney\r\n&c.) which did not send their returns to the general bill until 1636, but\r\ntheir figures have been included in the totals for those years. It will be\r\nseen that the plague of 1665 fully kept pace with the increase of\r\npopulation. The old City within the walls had 15,207 deaths in the year\r\nfrom all causes. It had become crowded since the beginning of Elizabeth’s\r\nreign by its gardens and churchyards being built upon, and its mansions\r\nturned into tenement-houses for a poorer class; and yet in 1563 the\r\nmortality from plague and other causes in the City and its Liberties, with\r\na population hardly exceeding that of the City alone in 1665, was 20,372.\r\nThe enormous total of 1665 was largely made up from the populous suburbs\r\nof Cripplegate, Whitechapel, Stepney, St Martin’s in the Fields, St\r\nGiles’s in the Fields, Southwark and Westminster, which would have\r\ncontributed but little to the total down to the middle third of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe following tables will show the progress of the epidemic from week to\r\nweek, the weekly deaths from all causes and from plague, and the incidence\r\nupon the several parts of London. The so-called ordinary deaths are much\r\nin excess of the average, and must have included many that were really\r\ncases of plague. Part of the excess, however, was due to the great\r\nprevalence of fever and spotted fever, which made a heavy mortality in the\r\nearly months before the plague began. Bowel complaint also is credited\r\nwith a good many deaths. The other more important items in the bills are\r\nconsumption and infantile troubles. Boghurst, however, says: “Almost all\r\nother diseases turned into the plague. For five or six months together\r\nthere was hardly any other disease seen but the plague and a few\r\ncasualties, whatever the Bills say; and Thucydides says the same of the\r\nplague at Athens.” As to the total of deaths in the year from all causes\r\n(97,306), Hodges thinks that it does not show the whole mortality. The\r\nlargest number of burials in one week is 8297; but he thinks that 12,000\r\nwere buried in that week, and that 4000 were buried in one day and night.\r\nBut there seems to be no reason to set aside the tally of the sextons to\r\nthat extent; the returns were made weekly from one hundred and forty\r\nparishes, and might easily have been exact to within a few in each.\r\n\r\n_Bill of Mortality of the Plague-year 1665 in London._\r\n\r\n   Week\r\n  ending    Christened   Buried     Plague\r\n\r\n  Dec. 27      229        291         1\r\n  Jan.  3      239        349         0\r\n       10      235        394         0\r\n       17      223        415         0\r\n       24      237        474         0\r\n       31      216        409         0\r\n  Feb.  7      221        393         0\r\n       14      224        462         1\r\n       21      232        393         0\r\n       28      233        396         0\r\n  Mar.  7      236        441         0\r\n       14      236        433         0\r\n       21      221        363         0\r\n       28      238        353         0\r\n  Apr.  4      242        344         0\r\n       11      245        382         0\r\n       18      287        344         0\r\n       25      229        398         2\r\n  May   2      237        388         0\r\n        9      211        347         9\r\n       16      227        353         3\r\n       23      231        385        14\r\n       30      229        400        17\r\n  June  6      234        405        43\r\n       13      206        558       112\r\n       20      204        615       168\r\n       27      199        684       267\r\n  July  4      207       1006       470\r\n       11      197       1268       725\r\n       18      194       1761      1089\r\n       25      193       2785      1843\r\n  Aug.  1      215       3014      2010\r\n        8      178       4030      2817\r\n       15      166       5319      3880\r\n       22      171       5568      4237\r\n       29      169       7496      6102\r\n  Sept. 5      167       8252      6988\r\n       12      168       7690      6544\r\n       19      176       8297      7165\r\n       26      146       6460      5533\r\n  Oct.  3      142       5720      4929\r\n       10      141       5068      4327\r\n       17      147       3219      2665\r\n       24      104       1806      1421\r\n       31      104       1388      1031\r\n  Nov.  7       95       1787      1414\r\n       14      113       1359      1050\r\n       21      108        905       652\r\n       28      112        544       333\r\n  Dec.  5      123        428       210\r\n       12      133        442       243\r\n       19      147        525       281\r\n             -----     ------    ------\r\n             9,967     97,306    68,596\r\n\r\n_Incidence on Parishes of the Plague in 1665._\r\n\r\n_Ninety-seven Parishes within the Walls._\r\n\r\n                     All deaths     Plague deaths\r\n  97 City parishes     15,207          9,877\r\n\r\n(The parishes with heaviest mortalities were St Anne’s, Blackfriars;\r\nChrist Church, Newgate;

As before, all that could afford to do so\r\nmade their escape at the outset. Sydenham, who fled with the rest, says\r\nthat two-thirds of the population left; which may be true of the City\r\nproper, but certainly not of the populous Liberties and suburbs on both\r\nsides of the water, as Defoe points out. The poorer classes were left\r\nstranded, and bore the brunt of the calamity, as they had always done.\r\nFlight was, doubtless, the best step to take, the motive being to get\r\n“into clean air,” as cardinal Wolsey expressed it in 1515. Those that were\r\nleft behind knew that they were in bad air, and knew that it mattered\r\nlittle whether they came into contact with the sick or not[1205]. Their\r\nemployments and wages mostly ceased as the plague extended from suburb to\r\nsuburb and to the City, so that with starvation on the one side and plague\r\non the other, they held their lives cheaply and bore themselves with an\r\nunconcern which was strange to the rich. Their desperate case explains, as\r\nDefoe correctly saw, the ease with which the mayor could always get men to\r\nundertake for pay the disagreeable and risky work of day and night\r\nwatchmen to the multitude of shut-up houses, of bearers of the dead, of\r\nburiers, of nurses, and distributors of the public charity. As soon as any\r\nfell in these humble ranks, others were willing to take their place; so\r\nthat at no period of the epidemic was there any break-down in the work of\r\nexpeditious burial or any failure in good order and decency. To carry the\r\npoor through the great crisis much money was needed; Defoe says that it\r\nwas forthcoming from all parts of England and he estimates the\r\ndistribution of relief at thousands of pounds weekly, although he failed\r\nto find the exact accounts, which, he thinks, had been destroyed in the\r\nfire of 1666. A thousand pounds a week, he says, was given from the king’s\r\npurse. The whole of this great system of relief was under the direction of\r\nthe Lord Mayor, Sir John Lawrence, who proved himself worthy of the best\r\ntraditions of his office. In the out-parishes there were Justices of the\r\nPeace who discharged the like duties.\r\n\r\nThe regular clergy for the most part left the town, but two are honourably\r\nmentioned as having stayed with the plague-stricken people, Dr Anthony\r\nWalker, of St Mary Aldermanbury, and Mr Meriton[1206].\r\n\r\nSometime in August Lord Arlington wrote to the bishop of London that the\r\nking was informed of many ministers and lecturers being absent from their\r\nposts during this time of contagion, and that nonconformists had thrust\r\nthemselves into their pulpits to preach seditions and doctrines contrary\r\nto the Church. His majesty wishes the bishop to prevent such mischiefs to\r\nChurch and State[1207]. The bishop replied, from Fulham, 19 August, that\r\nthe sober clergy remain, that he had refused some that offered to supply\r\nvacancies, suspecting them to be of the factious party, though they\r\npromised to conform, that most of his officers had deserted him and gone\r\ninto the country, but he could not learn that any nonconformists had\r\ninvaded the pulpit[1208]. The bishop, however, was not likely to hear much\r\nwithin his garden walls at Fulham of what was passing at Aldgate. There\r\ncan be no question that Church pulpits were occupied during the plague by\r\nministers who had been ejected in 1662. Chief among them was Thomas\r\nVincent, formerly minister of St Magdalen’s, Milk Street, who preached in\r\nSt Botolph’s, Aldgate, Great St Helen’s, and Allhallows Staining[1209].\r\nVincent says that it was the opportunity of irregular practitioners both\r\nin the Church and in medicine, and he is disposed to say a good word for\r\nthe latter from a fellow feeling with them. Besides Vincent, says Richard\r\nBaxter[1210], there were “some strangers that came thither since they were\r\nsilenced, as Mr Chester, Mr Janeway, Mr Turner, Mr Grimes, Mr Franklin,\r\nand some others.” These all became prominent in London Nonconformity; and\r\nBaxter clearly traces their subsequent power to the opportunity that the\r\nplague gave them:\r\n\r\n    “But one great benefit the plague brought to the city, that is, it\r\n    occasioned the silenced ministers more openly and laboriously to\r\n    preach the Gospel to the exceeding comfort and profit of the people;\r\n    in so much that to this day [1670] the freedom of preaching which this\r\n    occasioned, cannot, by the daily guards of soldiers, nor by the\r\n    imprisonments of multitudes be restrained. The ministers that were\r\n    silenced for Nonconformity had ever since 1662 done their work\r\n    privately.”\r\n\r\nBaxter knew of none among the Nonconformist ministers remaining in London\r\nwho fell victims to the plague, except “Mr Grunman, a German, a very\r\nhumble, holy, able minister, but being a silenced Nonconformist, was so\r\npoor that he was not able to remove his family.” Two others of the sect,\r\nwho fled, lost their lives--“Mr Cross, flying from the plague into the\r\ncountry died with his wife and some children as soon as he came thither,\r\nin the house of that learned worthy man, Mr Shaw, another silenced\r\nminister,” and Mr Roberts, “a godly Welsh minister, who also flying from\r\nthe plague, fell sick as far off as between Shrewsbury and Oswestry and\r\ndied in a little straw, but none durst entertain him.” Baxter himself\r\nfound refuge in the house of the Hampdens, in Bucks[1211], leaving his\r\nfamily, as he says, in the midst of plague at Acton. Defoe draws from the\r\nincident of the Nonconformists in Church pulpits a somewhat sentimental\r\nmoral; he sees nothing aggressive in it, but merely the levelling of\r\ndifferences by affliction, and a short-lived prospect of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe irregular practitioners of physic would appear to have been in great\r\nforce, just as in former plagues, when their bills were on every post.\r\nDefoe professes to give specimens of their advertisements, which he might\r\nhave adapted from actual advertisements in the news-sheets, the\r\n‘Intelligencer’ and the ‘Newes.’ The empirics were of both sexes, and of\r\nforeign extraction as well as native.\r\n\r\nAmong the regular physicians who practised for a time, at least, in the\r\nplague were the famous Professor Glisson, Dr Nathan Paget (an intimate\r\nfriend of Milton and cousin of Elizabeth Minshull whom the poet, in 1664,\r\nhad married for his third wife), Dr Wharton, of St Thomas’s Hospital, a\r\ndistinguished anatomist, Dr Berwick or Barwick, Dr Brooke, Dr Hodges, and\r\nDr Conyers. The last was one of two of his order who died of the plague.\r\nTwo Paracelsist or chemical physicians, Dr Dey and Dr Starkey, died of it:\r\nand Dr George Thomson says that he survived three several attacks of the\r\nbuboes, the first sore lasting for four months. A considerable number of\r\nchirurgeons and apothecaries are said (by Defoe) to have fallen victims.\r\nPepys says that at the first meeting of Gresham College (the Royal\r\nSociety) since the plague, held on January 22, 1666, Dr Goddard “did fill\r\nus with talk in defence of his and his fellow physicians’ going out of\r\ntown in the plague-time,” his plea being that their particular patients\r\nwere out of town, and they left at liberty. But that excuse ignores the\r\nfact that the time was a great emergency, and puts the defence upon the\r\nwrong ground.\r\n\r\nGoddard had attended Cromwell in the Irish and Scottish campaigns as\r\nphysician to the army. For a short time he had been a member of the\r\nCouncil of State, and for several years was master of a College at Oxford.\r\nHe was Gresham professor of physic, and one of the original council of the\r\nRoyal Society. This eminent man of science was the inventor and proprietor\r\nof “Goddard’s drop,” the secret of which he sold to Charles II. for a\r\nlarge sum, said to have been £6000. Dr Martin Lister says that the king\r\nshowed him the receipt, and that the drops were nothing more than the\r\nvolatile spirit of raw silk rectified with oil of cinnamon, and no better\r\nthan ordinary spirit of hartshorn. Another writer says that the drops\r\ncontained also skull of a person hanged and dried viper. According to\r\nSydenham, Goddard’s drops were preferable to other volatile spirits for\r\nthe particular purpose, namely, the recovery of people from faintings of\r\nvarious kinds. Even if Dr Goddard had remained in town, he would have been\r\na trafficker in nostrums as much as the empirics; nor is it probable, from\r\nall that we know, that he could have brought epidemiological principles to\r\nbear upon the management of the epidemic among the poor. The best teaching\r\nof the time counselled that which he himself practised, namely, flight.\r\n\r\nDefoe says that the Lord Mayor (Sir John Lawrence), the Sheriffs (Sir\r\nGeorge Waterman and Sir Charles Doe), the Court of Aldermen and certain of\r\nthe Common Council, or their deputies, came to a resolution and published\r\nit, viz.:\r\n\r\n    “That they would not quit the City themselves, but that they would be\r\n    always at hand for the preserving of good order in every place, and\r\n    for the doing justice on all occasions; as also for the distributing\r\n    the public charity to the poor; and, in a word, for the doing the duty\r\n    and discharging the trust reposed in them by the citizens to the\r\n    utmost of their power.”\r\n\r\nThe minutes are extant of numerous meetings of the Mayor and Council,\r\nwith the orders made (on May 11, June 17, 19, and 27, July 12, and at\r\nshort intervals thereafter)[1212]. Two of the Aldermen died of plague.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be admitted by all, that good order was kept, the dead\r\nburied expeditiously, day and night watchmen provided for an immense\r\nnumber of infected houses (until, as Vincent says, the infected houses\r\nbecame so many that there was no use shutting them up), bearers of the\r\ndead and grave-diggers engaged to fill the places of those who died, and\r\napplications heard for relief. One of the things that justly excited the\r\nadmiration of Defoe was the abundant supply of all the markets, and the\r\nalmost unvarying weight of the penny wheaten loaf, which is given every\r\nweek at the foot of the bill of mortality. The Parish Clerks brought out\r\ntheir bill regularly, although Hodges says that the sextons failed at\r\nlength to keep an accurate account of the number of corpses. All the dead\r\nwere buried at first in coffins and with full ceremony; but when the\r\ninfection became hottest in August and September, especially in the\r\ncrowded East-end and in Southwark, the bodies are said to have been\r\nbrought to the pits in cartloads and thrown in, sometimes without even a\r\ncovering[1213]. That is alleged by the writers on the plagues of 1603 and\r\n1625, and the same must have happened to some extent in 1665, but whether\r\nto the extent that Defoe’s graphic account implies may be doubted.\r\n\r\nThe burials took place over night until, as Vincent says, “now the nights\r\nare too short to bury the dead.” This was a reversal of the order, first\r\nissued in 1547 and probably carried out in the plague of 1603, that no\r\nburial was to take place between six in the evening and six in the\r\nmorning. Even at the worst time, coffins would seem to have been got for\r\nmost. Vincent says, “Now we could hardly go forth but we should meet many\r\ncoffins,” and he mentions one woman whom he met with a little coffin under\r\nher arm. Evelyn enters in his diary on September 7, the worst week of the\r\nepidemic: “I went all along the City and suburbs from Kent Street to St\r\nJames’s, a dismal passage and dangerous, to see so many coffins exposed in\r\nthe streets now thin of people.” Defoe’s weird description of the Aldgate\r\nplague-pit at midnight, with seven or eight lanterns set on the heaps of\r\nearth round the edge, and of the constant journeys to and fro of the\r\ndead-carts, has probably made the most of the realities of the case.\r\n\r\nA letter of Pepys to Lady Carteret, written from Woolwich on September 4,\r\ngives us a glimpse of the state of the City:\r\n\r\n    “I having stayed in the city till about 7400 died in one week, and of\r\n    them above 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day nor night\r\n    but tolling of bells; till I could walk Lumber-Street and not meet\r\n    twenty persons from one end to the other, and not fifty upon the\r\n    Exchange; till whole families, 10 and 12 together, have been swept\r\n    away; till my very physician, Dr Burnet, who undertook to secure me\r\n    against any infection, having survived the month of his own being shut\r\n    up, died himself of the plague; till the nights, though much\r\n    lengthened, are grown too short to conceal the burials of those that\r\n    died the day before, people being thereby constrained to borrow\r\n    daylight for that service.” The butcheries are everywhere visited, his\r\n    brewer is shut up, and his baker dead with his whole family.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, he writes in his diary:\r\n\r\n    “But Lord! what a sad time it is to all: no boats upon the river, and\r\n    grass grows all up and down Whitehall Court, and nobody but poor\r\n    wretches in the streets.”\r\n\r\nSome three weeks later (October 11) Evelyn writes in his diary: “Went\r\nthrough the whole city, having occasion to alight out of the coach in\r\nseveral places about business of money, when I was environed with\r\nmultitudes of poor pestiferous creatures begging alms. The shops\r\nuniversally shut up.” Vincent says that he would meet “many with sores and\r\nlimping in the streets,” (from the suppurating buboes in the groins).\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    “It would be endless to speak what we have seen and heard of:--some in\r\n    their frenzy rising out of their beds and leaping about their rooms;\r\n    others crying and roaring at their windows; some coming forth almost\r\n    naked into the streets”\r\n\r\n--the delirium being sometimes of the gentle or foolish kind, and\r\nsometimes violent. These incidents are much enlarged upon by Defoe, who\r\nmakes out the cries and groans (mentioned by Dekker and others for the\r\nearlier plagues) to have been from the pain of the hard and tense buboes.\r\nBoghurst says that the treatment by actual cautery and other escharotics\r\ncaused more pain than the buboes.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to the more horrible picture given by Defoe of the inmates of\r\na house all dying together, their bodies being found by the watchmen and\r\ntaken away in the dead-cart, we may turn to Vincent’s plain account of\r\nwhat happened in the house where he lodged, probably in the neighbourhood\r\nof Aldgate or Bishopsgate, when he came up from Islington to minister to\r\nthe sick.\r\n\r\n    “We were eight in the family--three men, three youths, an old woman\r\n    and a maid; all which came to me, hearing of my stay in town, some to\r\n    accompany me, others to help me [he was a celebrity in the religious\r\n    world with a large following]. It was the latter end of September\r\n    before any of us were touched.... But at last we were visited.... At\r\n    first our maid was smitten; it began with a shivering and trembling in\r\n    her flesh, and quickly seized on her spirits.... I came home and the\r\n    maid was on her death-bed; and another crying out for help, being left\r\n    alone in a sweating fainting-fit. It was on Monday when the maid was\r\n    smitten; on Thursday she died full of tokens. On Friday one of the\r\n    youths had a swelling in his groin, and on the Lord’s day died with\r\n    the marks of the distemper upon him. On the same day another youth did\r\n    sicken, and on the Wednesday following he died. On the Thursday night\r\n    his master fell sick of the disease, and within a day or two was full\r\n    of spots, but strangely recovered.... The rest were preserved.”\r\n\r\nThe two boys appear to have been conscious to the end, and to have died in\r\nthe placid mood that often came on in the last hours of plague, as in\r\nother prostrating infections such as yellow fever and cholera. In those\r\ntwo weeks at the end of September and beginning of October the burials in\r\nall London were 6460 (of plague 5533) and 5720 (of plague 4929).\r\n\r\nThe chief preventive measure which the mayor had to give effect to was the\r\nshutting-up of infected houses. Defoe says that he carried out that odious\r\npolicy considerately. The policy was a traditional one, and may or may\r\nnot have had its origin in medical prescription. It was practised, as we\r\nhave seen in a former chapter, early in the reign of Henry VIII., if not\r\neven before that. The doctrine underlying it was the contagiousness of\r\nplague, which was much more a doctrine of the faculty than of the people,\r\nand was most of all a doctrine of the Court. Originally the dogma of\r\ncontagiousness, in all its rigour, had been made for the persons of the\r\nTudor monarchs, and as late as 1665 it was in the atmosphere of the Court\r\nthat the contagion of plague was invested with the most powerful\r\nproperties. The common people of London gave no heed to it, because they\r\nsaw every hour that it was a matter of indifference; the middle classes\r\nheld it in a qualified way, knowing that there was less to fear from\r\nplague-bodies than from plague-infected ground; but kings took the\r\ncomprehensive view of it, allowing no exceptions or scientific\r\nreservations, and the Court doctors, such as Mead in the 18th century, at\r\nlength succeeded in making the high doctrine of plague-contagion to pass\r\ncurrent. Two instances are known from extant petitions, of its rigorous\r\napplication upon Court servants in 1665: one in the case of a trumpeter of\r\nthe king, and the other in the case of the barber to the household. In the\r\nlatter case, apparently when the Court was at Salisbury in the autumn, a\r\nstranger supposed to be visited with the sickness ran into the barber’s\r\ntent in his absence; whereon the tent and all his goods and instruments of\r\nlivelihood were burnt, he himself confined, and his servants sent away,\r\naccording to the orders for the preservation of the Court, “so that he\r\nlost his trade and was utterly ruined[1214].”\r\n\r\nThe more discriminating of the profession knew and taught that the seeds\r\nof plague could lurk in a bundle of clothes, or of bedding, or in other\r\neffects, or in bales of goods, and that they became the more virulent\r\nthrough the fermentation that goes on in these circumstances. The\r\ncontagion was understood to be _per fomitem_ and _per distans_; on the\r\nother hand, experience was rather against a contagion from the exhalations\r\nof the sick: the immunity of nurses was as striking as it has been in many\r\nother contagions. The people were instinctively right in their belief\r\nthat they mostly caught the plague because the infection was in the air of\r\nthe place; so long as they were living on a plague-stricken spot, they\r\nwere exposed to the risk; and if there were any difference in safety\r\nbetween dwelling-houses, and the streets, markets or shops, the preference\r\nseemed to lie with the former. The traditional or official doctrine,\r\nhowever, was that the plague-stricken were the sources of contagion, that\r\nall who had come near them were suspect, and that the safety of the well\r\ndepended upon the rigorous shutting-up of the sick and the suspected\r\ntogether. The experience of epidemic after epidemic might have shown that\r\nthis theoretical reasoning, so attractive to the “thorough” order of mind,\r\nwas worthless in practice. A great plague pursued its course until the\r\ninfected houses became too many for shutting up; if many plague-years did\r\nnot develop epidemics of the first degree, that was in accordance with\r\nsome epidemiological law, and not because the preventive measures were one\r\nyear effective and another year ineffective. However, a traditional\r\ndoctrine will always survive a good deal of adverse experience; and the\r\nshutting-up of houses, which had signally failed in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625\r\nand 1636, was resorted to once more in 1665, and perhaps with more rigour\r\nthan ever so as to give it a fair chance. Defoe has stated with great\r\nfairness the hardships of it, and he follows Hodges and Boghurst in\r\npronouncing it a mistake and a failure. Most of the horrible incidents of\r\nthe plague came from the shutting-up of houses; those which Defoe\r\nintroduces in that connexion do not exceed probability. It is hard to say\r\nwhether the condemnation of shutting-up, which found wide currency during\r\nand immediately after the plague of 1665, would have at length made any\r\ndifference to the traditional doctrine and practice. The occasion did not\r\narise again in London except for a few months in 1666, when the old\r\npractice seems to have been enforced. The corresponding doctrine and\r\npractice that arose in its place, was quarantine against foreign\r\nimportation; that rested firstly upon the sophistical assertion of the\r\nall-powerful Mead, that plague had been an exotic to England, and secondly\r\nupon the doctrine of plague-contagion in its most comprehensive and least\r\ndiscriminating form. But the quarantine law dates really from the Queen\r\nAnne period, and the curious history of its rise, progress, and overthrow\r\nbelongs to another part of this work.\r\n\r\nThe other general preventive measure besides the shutting-up of “visited”\r\nhouses was the burning of fires in the streets, which was also a tradition\r\nfrom Tudor times. The mayor loyally carried out that also; until in the\r\nbeginning of autumn a concurrence of things made an end of the practice.\r\nThese adverse influences were first, the heavy showers of rain, which put\r\nthe fires out; secondly, the differences in medical opinion whether\r\ncoal-fires or wood-fires were the better, and whether fires were to be\r\nrecommended at all; and thirdly the popular perception that the fires made\r\nno difference to the progress of the epidemic.\r\n\r\nIn the way of individual protection and treatment, the College of\r\nPhysicians issued a tract full of directions and prescriptions, which\r\nBoghurst says were all old, being taken from De Vigo († 1520). It is not\r\nnecessarily against methods of practice that they are old; but one cannot\r\nfail to observe how closely the medieval teaching about plague, cause and\r\ncure together, was followed to the last in England: for two centuries the\r\nwriters on plague reproduced the chapters and paragraphs almost without\r\nchange that we find in the treatise of the bishop of Aarhus, which\r\ncirculated in manuscript in England in the 15th century and was first\r\nprinted about 1480. The most popular preventive was something “to smell\r\nto,” not sweet but _aigre_. Hence the use of civet-boxes, pouncet-boxes,\r\nand pomanders, which were made to suit all purses. There were also\r\nplague-waters, one of which, “the plague-water of Matthias,” figures among\r\nthe prescriptions of the College of Physicians both in a cheap and in an\r\nexpensive form. The College’s prescription “to break the tumour” is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Take a great onion, hollow it, put into it a fig, rue cut small, and\r\n    a dram of Venice treacle; put it close stopt in a wet paper, and roast\r\n    it in the embers; apply it hot unto the tumour; lay three or four, one\r\n    after another; let one lie three hours.”\r\n\r\nThe Paracelsist or chemical physician, Thomson, gives a prescription which\r\nbrings out the mystical tendencies of that otherwise meritorious sect. It\r\nrelates to a method of curing plague by means of a toad.\r\n\r\n    “The great difficulty to bring this animal to a true Zenexton lies in\r\n    an exquisite preparation of it, the manner whereof that great\r\n    investigator of verity, Van Helmont, hath thus delivered, as he\r\n    received instructions from Butler, an Irishman who (to Helmont’s\r\n    knowledge) had cured some thousands of the pest in London. He gave\r\n    directions that a large Bufo, taken in the afternoon in the month of\r\n    June, should be hung up by the legs, nigh the fire, over a vessel of\r\n    yellow wax” etc.\r\n\r\nTobacco, smoked or chewed, came into great vogue in 1665 as a preservative\r\nfrom the plague. Hearne, the antiquary, says:\r\n\r\n    “I have been told that in the last great plague at London [1665] none\r\n    that kept tobacconists shops had the plague. It is certain that\r\n    smoaking it was looked upon as a most excellent preservative; in so\r\n    much that even children were obliged to smoak. And I remember that I\r\n    heard formerly Tom Rogers, who was yeoman beadle, say that when he was\r\n    that year, when the plague raged, a schoolboy at Eaton, all the boys\r\n    of that school were obliged to smoak in the school every morning, and\r\n    that he was never whipped so much in his life as he was one morning\r\n    for not smoaking[1215].”\r\n\r\nThe best medical details of the Great Plague come from Boghurst, who\r\nclaims that the observations were all his own.\r\n\r\n    With regard to its incidence he says: “About the beginning most men\r\n    got it with fuddling, surfeiting, over heating themselves, and\r\n    disorderly living.” Again: “Those that married in the heat of the\r\n    disease (if they had not had the disease before) almost all fell into\r\n    it in a week or a fortnight after it, both in the city and in the\r\n    country, of which most died, especially the men.” One of Dekker’s\r\n    stories of the year 1603 is an illustration of the same thing. “It\r\n    usually went through a whole kindred, though living in several places;\r\n    which was the cause it swept away many whole families.... In some\r\n    houses ten out of twelve died, and sixteen out of twenty.” Melancholy\r\n    for the loss of friends predisposed to it, while cheerfulness and\r\n    courage fortified some against it. Old people that had many sores upon\r\n    them, especially carbuncles, almost all died. The natural\r\n    constitution, disposition, or complexion “did much to make or mar the\r\n    disease.” People with hollow eyes commonly died. Those who drank\r\n    brandy and strong waters grew mad, looked about them wildly, and died\r\n    quickly in two days. “All that I saw that were let blood, if they had\r\n    been sick two, three, four or five days or more, died the same day.”\r\n    Teeming women fared miserably; they were not more subject than others:\r\n    but scarce one in forty lived (this is enlarged upon by Defoe). Many\r\n    people had the spotted fever and the plague both together, and many\r\n    the French pox and the plague both together, and yet both sorts\r\n    commonly lived (someone says that men caught the French pox of\r\n    purpose[1216]). All sorts died, but more of the good than the bad,\r\n    more men than women, more of dull complexion than fair. “Of all the\r\n    common hackney prostitutes of Luteners-lane, Dog-yard, Cross-lane,\r\n    Baldwin-gardens, Hatton-garden and other places, the common criers of\r\n    oranges, oysters, fruits etc., all the impudent drunken drabbing\r\n    bayles and fellows, and many others of the _rouge route_, there is but\r\n    few missing--verifying the testimony of Diemerbroeck that the plague\r\n    left the rotten bodies and took the sound[1217].” It fell not very\r\n    thick upon old people till about the middle or slake of the disease,\r\n    and most in the decrease and declining of the disease. Cats, dogs,\r\n    cattle, poultry, etc., were free from infection.\r\n\r\n    Some died in twelve or twenty days, but most in five or six. In summer\r\n    about one-half that were sick, died; but towards winter, three of four\r\n    lived. None died suddenly as stricken by lightning: “I saw none die\r\n    under twenty or twenty-four hours.” After one rising, or bubo, was\r\n    broke and run, commonly another and another would rise in several\r\n    parts of the body, so that many had the disease upon them half a year;\r\n    some risings would not break under half a year, being so deep in the\r\n    flesh.\r\n\r\nThis explains Dekker’s statement in 1603 that some had buboes repeatedly,\r\nand that one person had eighteen sores. Dr Thomson himself had buboes\r\nthrice. Hodges, also, knew of many cases fatal at the third seizure, the\r\nlater attacks being not relapses but new infections; some even fell at the\r\nfifth or sixth time, being before well recovered. In one of the earlier\r\nLondon plagues, that of 1563, Jones saw a case of a woman near Temple Bar\r\nthat ended fatally at the third attack, the buboes having suppurated\r\ntwice, but not at the third time. Boghurst goes on:\r\n\r\n    Of evil omen was “a white, soft, sudden, puffed up tumour on the neck\r\n    behind the ears, in the armpit, or in the flank;” also a “large\r\n    extended hard tumour under the chin, swelling downwards upon the\r\n    throat and fetching a great compass” (the brawny swelling of the\r\n    submaxillary salivary glands and surrounding tissues). Tokens came out\r\n    after a violent sweat, which was often induced of purpose by nurses,\r\n    who said, ‘Cochineal is a fine thing to bring out the tokens.’ Nurses\r\n    often killed their patients by giving them cold drinks. Many also were\r\n    killed by the shutting-up of houses, by wickedness (of nurses ?), by\r\n    confident and ignorant mountebanks, by over-hasty cutting and burning\r\n    of buboes. Servants and poor people removed to the pest-house or to\r\n    other houses in their sickness, took harm therefrom. People using\r\n    corrosives, actual cauteries and many intolerable applications put\r\n    their patients to more pain than the disease did.\r\n\r\n    The botches, or buboes (swollen lymph-glands in the neck, armpits or\r\n    groins), were the most distinctive sign of the plague, having given to\r\n    it the old name of “the botch.” Besides these, there were the “tokens”\r\n    (specially limited in meaning to livid spots on the skin), carbuncles\r\n    and blains. Carbuncles, says Boghurst, commonly rose upon the most\r\n    substantial, gross, firm flesh, as the thighs, legs, backside,\r\n    buttock; they never occurred, that he saw, on the head among the hair,\r\n    or on the belly. They were not seen until the end of July, were most\r\n    rife in September and October, commonly in old people, never in\r\n    children.\r\n\r\nHodges saw one carbuncle on the thigh, the size of two handbreadths, with\r\na large blister on it, “which being opened by the chirurgeon and\r\nscarification made where the mortification did begin, the patient expired\r\nunder the operation.” But most commonly carbuncles did not exceed the\r\nbreadth of three or four fingers. Boghurst continues:\r\n\r\n    “Blains are a kind of diminutive carbuncle, but are not so hard,\r\n    black, and fiery; sometimes there is a little core in them. Generally\r\n    they are no bigger than a two penny piece, or a groat at the biggest,\r\n    with a bladder full of liquor on the top of them, which, if you open\r\n    but a little, will come out whitish or of a lemon or straw colour.”\r\n    “Besides a blain there is a thing you may call a blister, puffing up\r\n    the skin, long like one’s finger in figure, like a blister raised with\r\n    cantharides; and such usually die.” The following experience is\r\n    remarkable, but it is doubtful whether Boghurst has not taken it from\r\n    Diemerbroek: “Towards the latter end of a plague, many people that\r\n    stayed, and others that returned, have little angry pustules and\r\n    blains rising upon them, especially upon the hands, without being sick\r\n    at all. But such never die, nor infect others; and I remember\r\n    Diemerbroeck saith, etc.” Can this be the meaning of “smallpox”\r\n    following the plague, as in the 16th century books by Alphanus,\r\n    Kellwaye and others?\r\n\r\nThe tokens proper, according to Hodges, were spots on the skin “proceeding\r\nfrom extravasated blood.” The body of the youth dissected by Thomson was\r\n“beset with spots, black and blue,” some of which when opened “contained\r\na coagulated matter.” The tokens, as the name implies, were made the most\r\ndistinctive sign of the plague; but they were far from being so constant\r\nas the botches or buboes. Boghurst says that “tokens appeared not much\r\nuntil about the middle of June;” and, according to a letter of September\r\n14, they must have been very variable even at the height of the plague:\r\n“The practitioners in physic stand amazed to meet with so many various\r\nsymptoms which they find among their patients; one week the general\r\ndistempers are blotches and boils, the next week as clear-skinned as may\r\nbe, but death spares neither; one week full of spots and tokens, and\r\nperhaps the succeeding bill none at all[1218].”\r\n\r\nThe account of the dissection by Thomson, of a youth dead of the plague,\r\nis perhaps all the morbid anatomy that has come down to us. He found what\r\nappear to have been infarcts in the lungs; the surface was “stigmatised\r\nwith several large ill-favoured marks, much tumified and distended,” from\r\nwhich, on section, there issued “sanious, dreggy corruption and a pale\r\nichor destitute of any blood.” The stomach contained a black, tenacious\r\nmatter, like ink. The spleen gave out on section an ichorish matter. The\r\nliver was pallid and the kidneys exsanguine. There were “obscure large\r\nmarks” on the inner surface of the intestines and stomach. The peritoneal\r\ncavity contained a “virulent ichor or thin liquor, yellowish, or\r\ngreenish.” There was a decoloured clot in the right ventricle, but “not\r\none spoonful of that ruddy liquor properly called blood could be obtained\r\nin this pestilential body.” In all other cadavers that he ever dissected\r\nhe had found that the right ventricle had blackish blood condensed, but\r\nthis one had a pale clot “like a lamb-stone cut in twain,” which puzzled\r\nhim greatly; perhaps it came, he conjectures, from a sumption of mere\r\ncrude milk which an indiscreet nurse had given the boy not long before he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAmong the symptoms of a fatal issue, Boghurst mentions the following:\r\nHiccough, continual vomiting, sudden looseness, or two or three stools in\r\nsuccession, shortness of breath, stopping of urine, great inward burning\r\nand outward cold, continual great thirst, faltering in the voice, speaking\r\nin the throat and occasionally sighing, with a slight pulling-in one side\r\nof the mouth when they speak, sleeping with the eyes half-open, trembling\r\nof the lips and hands and shaking of the head, staggering in going about\r\nrooms, unwillingness to speak, hoarseness preventing speech, cramp in the\r\nlegs, stiffness of one side of the neck, contraction of the jaws, the\r\nvomit running out from the side of the mouth, prolonged bleeding at the\r\nnose, the sores decreasing and turning black on a sudden.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that Boghurst says very little of the gentle or the\r\nviolent delirium, on which Defoe enlarges picturesquely; nor does he\r\nemphasize the extreme pain of the hard and tense buboes, which is another\r\nof Defoe’s themes. Hodges, however, says that “some of the infected run\r\nabout staggering like drunken men, and fall and expire in the streets;\r\nwhile others lie half-dead and comatous.... Some lie vomiting as if they\r\nhad drunk poison.”\r\n\r\nThe progress of the epidemic would seem to have been little influenced by\r\nthe weather or by what was done, unless the shutting-up of houses had\r\nhelped to intensify the virus. Boghurst says: “If very hot weather\r\nfollowed a shower of rain, the disease increased much;” and again: “If, in\r\nthe heat of the disease the wind blew very sharp and cold, people died\r\nvery quickly, many lying sick but one day.” We are told, however, by\r\nHodges that “the whole summer was refreshed with moderate breezes,” and\r\nthat “the heat was too mild to encourage corruption and fermentation.” The\r\nair itself, he says, “remained uninfected.” Rain fell from time to time in\r\nthe end of summer, copious enough to put out the fires in the streets.\r\nThere was at least one very hot day, near the beginning of the epidemic,\r\nthe 5th of June, which Pepys says was “the hottest day that I ever felt in\r\nmy life.” On September 20, however, he says that the increase of the\r\nplague could not have been expected “from the coldness of the late\r\nseason.”\r\n\r\nThe plague lingered in London throughout the year 1666, causing 1998\r\ndeaths in all. In January 1666 it was still at as high a figure as 158\r\ndeaths in a week, and in the week ending September 18 it rose again to the\r\nexceptional height of 104 deaths. In the first three weeks of December,\r\nthe deaths were 2, 4, and 3; and from that low level the plague never rose\r\nagain in London. A few annual deaths continued to appear in the bills down\r\nto 1679, when they finally disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague near London in 1665.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile various parts of England were affected with plague during and\r\nafter the great epidemic, and in one or two instances a little before it.\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the capital all the towns and villages\r\nusually implicated by the exodus from the City had cases of plague, as the\r\nfollowing table shows. It has been compiled from the parish registers, as\r\nextracted in Lysons’ _Environs of London_, Defoe’s widely discrepant\r\nfigures being given for comparison in the third column.\r\n\r\n                     All              Defoe’s\r\n                    causes    Plague   list.\r\n  Barking            230                200\r\n  Barnes              27\r\n  Barnet and Hadley                      43\r\n  Battersea          113\r\n  Beckenham           18\r\n  Brentford          103                432\r\n  Brentwood                              70\r\n  Bromley             27         7\r\n  Camberwell         133\r\n  Charlton             7         3\r\n  Chertsey                               18\r\n  Chiselhurst         21\r\n  Clapham             28\r\n  Croydon            141        61\r\n  Deptford           548       374      623\r\n  Ealing             286       244\r\n  Edmonton                               19\r\n  Eltham              44        32       85\r\n  Enfield            176                 32\r\n  Epping                                 26\r\n  Finchley            38\r\n  Greenwich          416                231\r\n  Hampstead          214\r\n  Heston              48        13\r\n  Hodsdon                                30\r\n  Hertford                               90\r\n  Hornsey             53        43       85\r\n  Islewort           195       149\r\n  Kensington          62        25\r\n  Kingston                              122\r\n  Lewisham            56\r\n  Mortlake           197       170\r\n  Newington, Stoke                       17\r\n  Norwood             12         2\r\n  Putney                        74\r\n  Romford             90                109\r\n  St Albans                             121\r\n  Stratford-Bow      139\r\n  Staines                                82\r\n  Tottenham       no entries             42\r\n  Twickenham                    21\r\n  Uxbridge                              117\r\n  Waltham Abbey                          23\r\n  Walthamstow         68\r\n  Wandsworth                   245\r\n  Ware                                  160\r\n  Watford                                45\r\n  Windsor                               103\r\n  Woodford            33\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact that comes out is that most of the parishes around\r\nLondon had actually fewer deaths from plague in 1665 than in 1603. The\r\nexceptions to this rule in 1665 are the villages on or near the Thames\r\nabove London-Battersea, Wandsworth, Putney, Mortlake, Brentford,\r\nIsleworth, and Ealing, which had all a very high mortality, Barnes being\r\nalmost exempt. On the lower reaches of the Thames, Barking on the Essex\r\nshore, and Deptford, Greenwich and Lewisham on the other side, had the\r\ninfection in them very severely; but these three places in Kent had a\r\nstill more severe visitation in 1666, along with other towns in that\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nOn September 9, Evelyn wrote from his Deptford house, Sayes Court, that\r\n“near thirty houses are visited in this miserable village.” The infection\r\ngot also among the ships of the navy; on August 29, on board the ‘Loyal\r\nSubject’ at Deal, Captain Fortescue and six men died suddenly, it was\r\nfeared of the plague.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlague in the Provinces in 1665-6.\r\n\r\nThe earliest accounts of plague in the provinces come from Yarmouth in\r\nNovember, 1664. On the 18th it is said to have been brought in a vessel\r\nfrom Rotterdam; three died in one house, of whom one had the plague. On\r\nNovember 30, the plague was spreading, if the searchers (drunken women,\r\nhowever) were to be credited. On February 8, 1665, there was another death\r\nfrom plague, and as the summer wore on the mortality increased rapidly. On\r\nJune 16, thirty had died in the week, the inhabitants had fled, the town\r\nwas like a country village, and the poor left behind were lamenting at\r\nonce the lack of work and of charity. On August 21, the king wrote from\r\nSalisbury to the bailiffs of Yarmouth concerning the plague. In the weeks\r\nending August 30 and September 6, there were 117 deaths (96 from plague)\r\nand 110 deaths (100 from plague), and as late as November 6, there had\r\nbeen 22 plague-deaths in the week. In March, 1666, the epidemic came to an\r\nend[1219]. Smaller outbreaks occurred in the autumn of 1665 and spring of\r\n1666 at Lynn, Norwich, Ipswich and Harwich. The great epidemic at\r\nColchester began in summer, 1665, but fell mostly in 1666, at a time when\r\nthere was little plague elsewhere, so that it practically closes the\r\nhistory of plague in England, and will come naturally at the end of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nMost of the provincial outbreaks in 1665 were of small extent, and were\r\nprobably due to introduction of the virus from London. The valley of the\r\nTyne, which had often experienced severe plagues, had a slight epidemic,\r\nsaid to have originated from the colliers returned from the Thames. On\r\nJuly 18, there were seven houses shut up at Sunderland, one at Wearmouth\r\nand one at Durham[1220]. A paragraph in the ‘Newes,’ from Durham, October\r\n13, says that the sickness in the north is now much assuaged. Newcastle\r\nremained almost free (although Defoe says different), two houses being\r\nshut up on January 30, 1666, and two at Gateshead. The whole north-west\r\nand west of England, which had suffered most during the last\r\nplague-period, in the Civil Wars, appears to have escaped altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the south, there was a good deal of the infection at Southampton in the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1665; on July 6, “the poor will not suffer the rich\r\nto quit the town and leave them to starve[1221].” It is heard of, also, at\r\nPoole and Sherborne in Dorset (in November), at Salisbury, where the Court\r\nlay for some weeks, and at Battle[1222] in Sussex; but in none of these\r\nplaces to any great extent. Various places in Kent had cases in\r\n1665--Rochester, Chatham, Sandwich, Eastry, Westwell, Deal, Dover and\r\nCanterbury[1223]; but it was only the naval stations that had more than a\r\nfew cases in 1665; while all of them had it far worse in 1666. Other\r\ncentres in 1665 were in Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nAt Peterborough, Oundle and Newport Pagnell, there was a visitation of the\r\nseverer kind, with flight of the richer inhabitants, and the usual arrest\r\nof work and trade. The parish register of Yardley, Hastings, records that\r\n60 persons died of plague in that town from June 5, 1665, to January 3,\r\n1666. There was also a sharp epidemic in Cambridge and in the country\r\naround, of which we get a glimpse in a letter of October 19, 1665, written\r\nfrom Clare Hall to one of the fellows of Clare[1224]:\r\n\r\n    “Alderman Mynell the brewer and one of his children died of the plague\r\n    this last Monday; he hath had four children in all dead of it.\r\n    Clayton, the barber in Petty Cury, and one of his children, died last\r\n    Saturday of the sickness. It is newly broken out sadly by Christ’s\r\n    (though they have all fled from the Colledge upon Mr Bunchly, their\r\n    manciple, dying of the plague)--where Nicholson the smith, his wife\r\n    and two children are dead within three days, his other children being\r\n    deadly sick in the house. But it most rageth in St Clement’s parish,\r\n    where seldom a day passeth without one dead of the sickness.... Poor\r\n    Mr Brown, the old man that is one of the University musicians, and Mr\r\n    Saunders that sings the deep bass, are shut up in Mr Saunders’ house\r\n    in Green Street, whose child died last week suspected. Two houses at\r\n    Barton are infected by two of Alderman Mynell’s children, that are\r\n    dead there. Ditton is broke out just by the butcher, from whom we had\r\n    our meat, which made us hastily remove to Grantchester. H. Glenton,\r\n    the carrier, fled from this town to Shelford, where he died within two\r\n    or three days, suspected.... Royston is sadly in two or three places,\r\n    the last of which is just in the middle of the town. The infection,\r\n    they say, was brought thither by a Cambridge man, whom they caught,\r\n    and shut him up; but he hath since made his escape.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epidemic of Plague at Eyam, 1665-6.\r\n\r\nAnother of the English towns visited by plague in 1665 was Derby; whether\r\nthe cases were many or few, they caused great alarm, the town being\r\nforsaken, the streets grass-grown, and the market set up on a new stance,\r\nto which the farmers and traders came primed with a plug of tobacco in\r\ntheir mouths as a preservative. But the epidemic in Derby itself was\r\ntotally eclipsed in interest by an extraordinary outbreak of plague in the\r\nsmall village of Eyam, at the opposite end of the county, in the North\r\nPeak, some twelve miles to the west of Sheffield. The plague of Eyam is,\r\nindeed, the most famous of all English plagues; the story of it has been\r\ntold many times in prose and verse, its traditional incidents being well\r\nsuited to minor poets and moral writers, and the whole action of the\r\ndrama conveniently centered within a circuit of half a mile in a cup of\r\nthe heathy hills[1225].\r\n\r\nEyam was a village of some three hundred and fifty inhabitants, standing\r\namong meadows around which the hills towered. It had no resident doctor,\r\nbut it had two ministers. The one was the rector, the Rev. William\r\nMompesson, a young man of twenty-seven, with a wife and two children, who\r\nhad been settled in Eyam only a year and did not like it; the other was\r\nthe former rector, the Rev. Thomas Stanley, who had been ejected for\r\nnonconformity in 1662, and had remained to carry on his ministrations as a\r\nDissenter among such of his old flock as adhered to him. The wealthier\r\nhouseholders resided at the western and higher end of the village, on the\r\nother side of a brook which crossed under the road; as we shall see, they\r\nescaped the infection almost if not altogether. The annual village wake\r\nhad been held in August, 1665, with more than the usual concourse of\r\npeople from villages near. On the 2nd or 3rd September a box arrived from\r\nLondon to the village tailor, who lived in a small house at the western\r\nend of the churchyard; it contained old clothes which someone in London is\r\nsupposed to have bought for him cheap, and some tailors’ patterns of\r\ncloth. This box is assumed to have been opened by one George Vicars, a\r\nservant, who was certainly the first victim of plague. He found the\r\ncontents to be damp and hung them up at the fire to dry. He was quickly\r\nseized with violent sickness, became delirious, developed buboes in his\r\nneck and groin, a plague-token on his breast the third day, and died in a\r\nwretched state on September 6. His body, which is said to have become soon\r\nputrid, was buried in the churchyard on the 7th. Nearly a fortnight passed\r\nbefore another case occurred, that of a youth supposed to have been the\r\ntailor’s son, who was buried on the 22nd September. Before the 30th four\r\nmore had died, and in the course of October twenty-two more were buried\r\nof the plague. The deaths in November declined to seven, and in December\r\nthey were nine. There was now snow on the ground, with hard frost, and at\r\nthe beginning of January, 1666, the plague was confined to two houses.\r\nFour died in January, eight in February, six in March, nine in April, and\r\nonly three in May. On June 2, another burial occurred, and then there was\r\nanother pause. But in a week or more the epidemic broke out with renewed\r\npower, three having been buried on the 12th of June, three on the 15th,\r\none on the 16th, three on the 17th, and so on until the total for June\r\nreached nineteen. The wealthier villagers at the west end had taken the\r\nalarm before and had mostly fled in the spring; those who stayed kept\r\nwithin their houses or at least did not cross the stream. Now that the\r\ninfection was revived in the hot weather of June, the rector’s wife also\r\nproposed flight, but on her husband’s refusal, she resolved to remain with\r\nhim, and to send her two children to a relative in Yorkshire. At the same\r\ntime the villagers in general were instinctively moved to escape from the\r\ntainted spot; but Mompesson used his authority to prevent them, and a\r\nboundary line was drawn round the village, about half a mile in circuit\r\nand marked by various familiar objects, beyond which no one was to go.\r\nMompesson’s motive appears to have been to prevent the spread of the\r\ninfection to the country around, and his parishioners submitted passively.\r\nAfter the end of June the villagers would have found it difficult to\r\nescape, owing to the terror which the very name of their village caused in\r\nall the country round. Some of them quitted their cottages and took up\r\ntheir abode in shelters built along the side of a rocky glen within the\r\ncordon. The earl of Devonshire, then at Chatsworth, promised Mompesson\r\nthat the village should not be left without supplies; and people from the\r\nvillages near brought their market produce to certain stated points on the\r\nboundary, where the Eyam people came to fetch it, the money paid being\r\ndropped into water. Thus shut up in their narrow valley, the villagers\r\nperished helplessly like a stricken flock of sheep. By the end of June\r\nceremonial burials came to an end, the church and the churchyard were\r\nclosed, the dead were carried out wrapped in sheets by one of the\r\nvillagers noted for his herculean strength, and laid in shallow graves in\r\nthe meadows or on the hill-sides. In July the deaths mounted up to five or\r\nsix on some days, and the total for the month to fifty-seven. In August\r\nthe dead numbered seventy-eight, among them the rector’s wife on the 25th,\r\nafter a walk with her husband through the meadows, during which she is\r\nsaid to have made the ominous remark that the air smelled sweet[1226].\r\nSeptember added twenty-four to the total, and there were now only about\r\nforty-five left alive in the place. Of these, fifteen died to the 11th\r\nOctober, when the mortality ceased. Some of the survivors had passed\r\nthrough an attack of the plague, among them the rector’s man, whose buboes\r\nsuppurated. Mompesson himself, who had an issue open in his leg all the\r\ntime, escaped the infection, as well as his maid-servant. A young woman of\r\nEyam, married in the village of Corbor, two miles off, came one day to see\r\nher mother, whom she found sick of the plague; on her return home she took\r\nthe sickness and died, but no one else in Corbor had it. A man was also at\r\nlarge in the neighbourhood suspected of plague, to whom the earl of\r\nDevonshire sent a doctor. The doctor and patient met by appointment on the\r\nopposite banks of a stream, and the diagnosis made across the water\r\nacquitted the man of plague; even in these unconventional circumstances\r\nthe consultation did not end without a prescription (still extant) for a\r\nbottle of “stuff.” Seventy-six households in Eyam were infected, and out\r\nof these two hundred and fifty-nine persons were buried of the plague.\r\nDuring the time that the infection lasted eight more died from other\r\ncauses. When the sickness had ceased Mompesson set about burning the\r\ninfected articles in the empty cottages. Three years after, in 1669, he\r\nwas presented to the better living of Eakring, in Notts; but on arriving\r\nto enter on his duties he was refused admission by the villagers, and had\r\nto take up his residence in a temporary hut in Rufford Park, until such\r\ntime as the prejudices of his new parishioners had been overcome. He\r\nmarried another wife, and for thirty-nine years held the living of\r\nEakring, where he died on March 7, 1708. Stanley, his Dissenting colleague\r\nat Eyam, died there a few years after the plague.\r\n\r\nSeveral things combined to magnify the disaster at Eyam. The story of the\r\nbox of clothes from London is entirely credible, and can be matched by\r\nmany other instances in the history of plague and of cholera[1227].\r\nNothing intensifies the virus of such diseases so much as fermentation\r\nwithout air in the textures of clothes or linen; a whiff from the opened\r\nbox or bundle suffices soon to prostrate the person who breathes it. The\r\npoison at Eyam was a powerful one from the first, and it is credible that\r\nthe body of the earliest victim did become quickly putrid. The heavy\r\nmortality, with few recoveries, which followed after a fortnight’s\r\ninterval, and continued all through the winter, also shows a virus raised\r\nto no ordinary potency. But, for the revival of the infection in June,\r\n1666, we must seek other causes. Eyam was one of those basins which, on a\r\nlarge scale or on a small, have often been observed to keep infection in\r\ntheir soil. The virus must have passed into the pores of the ground after\r\nthe first sixty or more burials in the churchyard down to the lull of the\r\nepidemic in winter; with the rise of the ground-water in spring, it would\r\nbe comparatively inactive; but in June, when the water was again sinking\r\nin the soil and the great heat was raising emanations from the dry ground,\r\nit broke forth with an intensity which poisoned the whole air of the\r\nvalley. The burials, after the end of June, without coffins and in shallow\r\ngraves in the meadows or on the hill-side, were so much ferment added to a\r\nsoil already permeated by it. Flight from such a place was the only\r\nsafety, and the rector, with the best motives, counselled the people to\r\nremain. Mompesson’s conduct has always been held up as a pattern of\r\nheroism, as if the circumstances had been desperate like those of the\r\nTrojans when the Greeks were in their streets and houses:\r\n\r\n  Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem.\r\n\r\nNo word of detraction should be spoken of anyone who does manfully what he\r\nconceives to be his duty to his neighbours; but the villagers of Eyam were\r\nsacrificed, all the same, to an idea, and to an idea which we may now say\r\nwas not scientifically sound. When the impulse came upon them to flee,\r\nthey might have left their tainted soil without much risk to the country\r\naround so long as they did not collect in one spot or carry with them\r\nbedding or the like susceptible articles: those who did flee from the\r\nhouses at the upper end of the village are not known to have carried the\r\ninfection to other places, and the young woman who brought it to Corbor\r\ngave it to no one else. But the wisdom of flight may be regarded by some\r\nas still disputable; while it will be admitted by all that Mompesson acted\r\nfor the best according to his lights.\r\n\r\nThe plague in 1666 raged severely in a number of towns, while it lingered\r\non in London. The information from Winchester is vague; it is said that\r\nthe dead were carried out in carts and buried on the downs to the\r\neastward[1228]; the epidemic was over by the 1st of December, so that the\r\nCollege resumed[1229]. Pepys enters in his Diary (April 4, 1667): “One at\r\nthe table [the duke of Albemarle’s] told an odd passage in the late\r\nplague, that at Petersfield (I think he said), one side of the street had\r\nevery house almost infected through the town, and the other not one shut\r\nup.” There may have been other such centres of plague, and equally\r\ninteresting observations made on them; but it appears to be the merest\r\nchance whether anything is recorded of them at all, or whether one has the\r\nluck to come across the record.\r\n\r\nThe great centres of plague in 1666 had some connexion with the fleet, and\r\nwere mostly in Kent and Essex. Deptford and Greenwich had more plague that\r\nyear than the year before, the total deaths at the former having been 715\r\n(of plague 522) and at the latter 423. Eltham and Lewisham were also\r\nvisited in proportion. The other intense centre of infection in Kent was\r\nDeal. On the 26th August, seven died of the plague, and twenty in the\r\nwhole week. At that date there were said to be only 16 houses which had\r\nnot had plague in them. On December 9, all the houses were clear, although\r\nthe crews of ships still avoided the town. Next to Deal, Sandwich, Dover,\r\nCanterbury and Maidstone had considerable outbreaks in the autumn. At\r\nPortsmouth also there was a sharp outbreak in the summer of 1666,\r\ntwenty-one having died of plague in a week at the beginning of July.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Counties, plague revived to a considerable extent in 1666\r\nat Norwich, Ipswich, Harwich and Woodbridge, the Yarmouth outbreak, which\r\nhad been the great one in that quarter the year before, having come to an\r\nend in the spring. But it was at Colchester that the epidemic engrossed\r\nattention in 1666. Colchester had, indeed, two successive seasons of\r\nplague, or rather a continuous prevalence of it from the summer of 1665 to\r\nDecember, 1666. The plague at Colchester in 1665-66 was the greatest of\r\nall provincial plagues since the Black Death, unless, indeed, we credit\r\nthe numbers (11,000 or 12,000) given for a plague at York in 1390. It\r\nreproduced the mortality of the Great Plague of London on a scale more\r\nthan proportionate to its size, and it doubtless called forth the same\r\nclass of incidents--flight of the wealthier classes, and almost total\r\nextermination of the poor. No documents remain, however, of this plague\r\nexcept the oaths administered to searchers and bearers of the dead\r\n(printed below) and the weekly totals of deaths from plague and from other\r\ncauses[1230]. The weekly bills are, indeed, as eloquent a testimony as\r\nany detailed description could have been; and as they are the most\r\ncomplete of the kind for a provincial town, I have transcribed them from\r\nthe manuscript record in full. The small number of deaths from ordinary\r\ncauses points to the emptiness of the better quarters of the town; the\r\ntotal deaths in seventeen months, 5345, including 4817 plague-deaths and\r\n528 from other causes, must have meant an enormous clearance of the poorer\r\nclasses. Colchester was then a place of considerable wealth, with a\r\nthriving Dutch trade and a considerable Dutch colony. Perhaps the\r\nconnexion with Holland, where plague had been rife in the years just\r\nbefore, may explain the origin of the outbreak; but local conditions of\r\nsoil, overcrowding, and the like must be looked to for the cause of its\r\nextraordinary persistence and fatality.\r\n\r\n_Weekly mortalities in Colchester, August 14, 1665, to December 14, 1666,\r\nfrom plague and other diseases._\r\n\r\n1665\r\n\r\n   Week          Plague     Other\r\n  ending\r\n\r\n  Aug. 21          26         2\r\n       28          62         2\r\n  Sept. 8         122         4\r\n       15         153        22\r\n       22         159        25\r\n       29         100        25\r\n  Oct.  6         161        27\r\n       13         122        23\r\n       20         106        15\r\n       27          60        41\r\n  Nov.  3         104        13\r\n       10          88        22\r\n       17          88        18\r\n       24          62         8\r\n  Dec.  1          38        10\r\n        8          39         6\r\n       15          67         4\r\n       22          53         7\r\n       29          21         3\r\n\r\n1666\r\n\r\n  Jan.  5          23         6\r\n       12          46         8\r\n       19          36        13\r\n       26          26        10\r\n  Feb.  2          34         9\r\n        9          25         3\r\n       16          23         7\r\n       23          33         6\r\n  Mar.  2          53         2\r\n        9          26        11\r\n       16          37         5\r\n       23          48         4\r\n       30          66         1\r\n  Apr.  6          73         2\r\n       13          90         2\r\n       20          68         4\r\n       27          90         4\r\n  May   4         169         8\r\n       11         167         7\r\n       18         150        11\r\n       25          98        12\r\n  June  1          89        10\r\n        8         110        10\r\n       15         139         3\r\n       22         195         6\r\n       29         176         4\r\n  July  6         167         8\r\n       13         160         9\r\n       20         175         3\r\n       27         109         4\r\n  Aug.  3         109         2\r\n       10          85         4\r\n       17          70         1\r\n       24          51         1\r\n       31          53         4\r\n  Sept. 7          31         6\r\n       14          22         2\r\n       21          16         2\r\n       28          10         2\r\n  Oct.  5           7         2\r\n       12           7         0\r\n       19           7         2\r\n       26           4         2\r\n  Nov.  2           4         2\r\n        9           4         2\r\n       16           2         6\r\n       23           1         4\r\n       30           1         8\r\n  Dec.  7           1         7\r\n       14           0         0\r\n                 ----       ---\r\n                 4817       528\r\n\r\nTo relieve the poverty caused by this great disaster a tax was levied on\r\nvarious other parts of the county of Essex, and contributions were made by\r\nprivate individuals, the London churches collecting £1311. 10_s._ in the\r\nbreathing-time between the plague and the fire. Colchester had so far\r\nrecovered in the end of 1666 as to be able to contribute in turn about a\r\nhundred pounds for the relief of London after the fire[1231].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last of Plague in England.\r\n\r\nThe history of plague in England must be made to end with a solitary\r\nepidemic at Nottingham in 1667, but not without some misgivings as to the\r\ncorrectness of the date. Dr Deering, the historian of the town in 1751,\r\npaid little heed to epidemics, although medicine was his business; but he\r\nmentions one of smallpox in 1736, which had probably come within his own\r\nexperience, and proceeds:\r\n\r\n    “I question much whether there has been the like since the plague\r\n    which visited the town in 1667, and made a cruel desolation in the\r\n    higher part of Nottingham, for very few died in the lower; especially\r\n    in a street called Narrow Marsh, it was observed that the infection\r\n    had no power, and that during the whole time the plague raged, not one\r\n    who lived in that street died of it, which induced many of the richer\r\n    sort of people to crowd thither and hire lodgings at any price; the\r\n    preservation of the people was attributed to the effluvia of the\r\n    tanners’ ouze (for there were then 47 tanners’ yards in that place),\r\n    besides which they caused a smoak to be made by burning moist tanners’\r\n    knobs[1232].”\r\n\r\nIf there had been any reference to the parish registers or to the\r\ncorporation minutes, we should have had no reason to doubt that this\r\nepidemic had been correctly assigned to 1667. The last Winchester epidemic\r\nhad been given under the year 1668, first by one local historian, and then\r\nby another who copied him; but when a third went to the manuscript\r\nrecords, he found that the year was 1666, as indeed an incidental\r\nreference to the re-opening of Winchester School on 1st December, 1666,\r\n“the sickness being in all appearance extinguished,” might have warranted\r\none in concluding. It is a singular experience to have brought the history\r\nof plague down through several centuries, not without particulars of times\r\nand numbers, and to be obliged to end it in the latter half of the 17th\r\ncentury with an unauthenticated date. The Nottingham epidemic may have\r\nbeen an exception to the generality that all England was finally delivered\r\nfrom the plague in 1666; it is due, at least, to the local historian, in\r\nthe absence of evidence against, to record his date of 1667. The\r\ndifficulty of confirming so simple a fact at so late a period may dispose\r\nthe readers of this work to be tolerant of any lack of certainty and\r\nprecision that they may discover in its history of more remote times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aarhus, bishop of, his book on plague, 209,\r\n    his identity, 210 _note_\r\n\r\n  Abbotsley, scene in church, 39\r\n\r\n

Hist.\r\nSociety, I. 25.\r\n\r\n[11] The first of Beda’s incidents of the Barking monastery relates to a\r\nmiraculous sign in the heavens showing where the cemetery was to be. It\r\nbegins: “Cum tempestas saepe dictae cladis, late cuncta depopulans, etiam\r\npartem monasterii hujus illam qua viri tenebantur, invasisset, et passim\r\nquotidie raperentur ad Dominum.”\r\n\r\n[12] “Erat in eodem monasterio [Barking] puer trium circiter, non amplius\r\nannorum, Æsica nomine, qui propter infantilem adhuc aetatem in virginum\r\nDeo dedicatarum solebat cella nutriri, ibique medicari. Hic praefata\r\npestilentia tactus ubi ad extrema pervenit clamavit tertio unam de\r\nconsecratis Christo virginibus, proprio eam nomine quasi praesentem\r\nalloquens ‘Eadgyd, Eadgyd, Eadgyd’; et sic terminans temporalem vitam\r\nintravit aeternam. At virgo illa, quam moriens vocabat, ipso quo vocata\r\nest die de hac luce subtracta, et ilium qui se vocavit ad regnum coeleste\r\nsecuta est.” Beda, p. 265. Then follows the story of a nun dying of the\r\npestilence in the same monastery.\r\n\r\n[13] Beda, Lib. IV. cap. 14. In addition to the instances in the text,\r\nwhich I have collected from Beda’s _Ecclesiastical History_, I find two\r\nmentioned by Willan in his “Inquiry into the Antiquity of the Smallpox,”\r\n(_Miscell. Works_, London, 1821, pp. 109, 110): “About the year 672, St\r\nCedda, Bishop of the East Saxons, being on a visitation to the monastery\r\nof Lestingham, was infected with a contagious distemper, and died on the\r\nseventh day. Thirty monks, who came to visit the tomb of their bishop,\r\nwere likewise infected, and most of them died” (_Vita S. Ceddae_, VII.\r\nJan. p. 375. Cf. Beda, IV. 3). Again: “In the course of the year 685, the\r\ndisease re-appeared at Lindisfarne, (Holy Island), St Cuthbert’s abbacy,\r\nand in 686 spread through the adjoining district, where it particularly\r\naffected children” (_Vita S. Cuthberti_, cap. 33). Willan’s erudition has\r\nbeen used in support of a most improbable hypothesis, that the pestilence\r\nof those years, in monasteries and elsewhere, was smallpox.\r\n\r\n[14] _Historia Abbatum Gyrvensium, auctore anonymo_, §§ 13 and 14. (App.\r\nto vol. II. of Beda’s works. Eng. Hist. Society’s edition, p. 323.)\r\n\r\n§ 13. Qui dum transmarinis moraretur in locis [Benedict] ecce subita\r\npestilentiae procella Brittaniam corripiens lata nece vastavit, in qua\r\nplurimi de utroque ejus monasterio, et ipse venerabilis ac Deo dilectus\r\nabbas Eosterwini raptus est ad Dominum, quarto ex quo abbas esse coeperat\r\nanno.\r\n\r\n§ 14. Porro in monasterio cui Ceolfridus praeerat omnes qui legere, vel\r\npraedicare, vel antiphonas ac responsoria dicere possent ablati sunt\r\nexcepto ipso abbate et uno puerulo, qui ab ipso nutritus et eruditus.\r\n\r\nIn the Article “Baeda,” _Dict. Nat. Biog._, the Rev. W. Hunt points out\r\nthat the boy referred to in the above passage would have been Beda\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[15] The history of the name _pestis flava ictericia_ is given by\r\nO’Donovan in a note to the passage in the _Annals of the Four Masters_, I.\r\n275: “Icteritia vel aurigo, id est abundantia flavae bilis, per corpus\r\neffusae, hominemque pallidum reddentis,” is the explanation of P. O’S.\r\nBeare. The earliest mention of “yellow plague” appears to have been in an\r\nancient life of St Gerald of Mayo, in Colgan’s _Acta Sanctorum_, at the\r\ncalendar date of 13th March.\r\n\r\n[16] _Polychronicon_, Rolls edition, V. 250.\r\n\r\n[17] _The Story of England_, Rolls series, ed.

Another narrator of the story\r\nof St Elphege and the Danes is Henry of Huntingdon (Rolls ed. p. 179); he\r\nsays nothing of the pestilence, but describes the sack of Canterbury.\r\nEadmer also (_Historia Novorum in Anglia_, Rolls ser. 81, p. 4) omits the\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\n[29] Quoted by Higden, _Polychronicon_, Rolls ed.

Hist. Society’s edition I. 159), takes Beda’s\r\nSussex reference to famine and makes it do duty, under the year 665, for\r\nthe great general plague of 664, having apparently overlooked Beda’s\r\nentirely distinct account of the latter.\r\n\r\n[40] _Hist. Eccles._ § 290:--“Siquidem tribus annis ante adventum ejus in\r\nprovinciam, nulla illis in locis pluvia ceciderat, unde et fames\r\nacerbissima plebem invadens inopia nece prostravit. Denique ferunt quia\r\nsaepe quadraginta simul aut quinquaginta homines inedia macerati\r\nprocederent ad praecipitium aliquod sive ripam maris, et junctis misere\r\nmanibus pariter omnes aut ruina perituri, aut fluctibus absorbendi\r\ndeciderent. Verum ipso die, quo baptisma fidei gens suscepit illa,\r\ndescendit pluvia serena sed copiosa, refloruit terra, rediit viridantibus\r\narvis annus laetus et frugifer.”\r\n\r\n[41] Green _Short History of the English People_, p. 39: “The very fields\r\nlay waste, and the land was scourged by famine and plague.” I have missed\r\nthis reference to plague in the original authorities. A passage in\r\nHigden’s _Polychronicon_ (V. 258) may relate to that period, although it\r\nis referred to the mythical time of Vortigern.\r\n\r\n[42] Stow, in enumerating the instances of public charity in his _Survey\r\nof London_, ascribes the melting of the church plate to Ethelwald, bishop\r\nof Winchester in the reign of King Edgar, about the year 963.\r\n\r\n[43] The murrain was a flux, _anglicé_ “scitha” (Roger of Howden) or\r\n“schitta” (Bromton).\r\n\r\n[44] Simeon of Durham, in Rolls series, II. 188.

The number of\r\nchurches may seem large for the population; but it should be kept in mind\r\nthat these city parish churches were mere chapels or oratories, like the\r\nside-chapels of a great church. Indeed, at Yarmouth, they were actually\r\nbuilt along the sides of the single great parish church; whereas, at\r\nNorwich, there were sixty of them standing each in its own small parish\r\narea, the Cathedral, as well as the other conventual churches, being the\r\ngreater places of worship. Lincoln is said to have had 49 of these small\r\nchurches, and York 40.

The itinerary\r\nof Bishop Baldwin, which the author follows, was in 1188; but the “his\r\nquoque nostris diebus” clearly refers to a later date, which may have been\r\nthe year after, or may have been the more severe famine of 1195-7 or of\r\n1203.\r\n\r\n[74] _Histor.

It suggests a larger\r\npopulation in the capital than we might have been disposed to credit. The\r\nsame writer says that London was so full of people when the parliament was\r\nsitting the year before (1257) that the city could hardly hold them all in\r\nher ample bosom. The Annals of Tewkesbury put the whole mortality from\r\nfamine and fever in London in 1258 at 20,000. But the whole population did\r\nnot probably exceed 40,000.\r\n\r\n[96] The year 1274 was the beginning of so exceptional a murrain of sheep\r\nthat it deserves mention here, although murrains do not come within the\r\nscope of the work. It is recorded by more than one contemporary. Rishanger\r\n(p. 84) says: “In that year a disastrous plague of sheep seized upon\r\nEngland, so that the sheep-folds were everywhere emptied through the\r\nspreading of it. It lasted for twenty-eight years following, so that no\r\nfarm of the whole kingdom was without the infliction of that misery. Many\r\nattributed the cause of this disease, which the inhabitants had not been\r\nacquainted with before, to a certain rich man of the Frankish nation, who\r\nsettled in Northumberland, having brought with him a certain sheep of\r\nSpanish breed, the size of a small two year old ox, which was ailing and\r\ncontaminated all the flocks of England by handing on its disease to them.”\r\nUnder the year following, 1275, he enters it again, using the term\r\n“scabies.” Thorold Rogers (_Hist. of Agric. and Prices_, I. 31) has found\r\n“scab” of sheep often mentioned in the bailiffs’ accounts from about 1288;\r\nit is assumed to have become permanent from the item of tar occurring\r\nregularly in the accounts; but tar was used ordinarily for marking. It may\r\nhave been sheep-pox, which Fitzherbert, in his _Book of Husbandry_\r\n(edition of 1598), describes under the name of “the Poxe,” giving a clear\r\naccount of the way to deal with it by isolation. For murrains in general,\r\nthe reader may consult Fleming’s _Animal Plagues_, 2 vols. 1871--1884, a\r\nwork which is mostly compiled (with meagre acknowledgment for\r\n“bibliography” only) from the truly learned work of Heusinger, _Recherches\r\nde Pathologie Comparée_, Cassel, 1844. Fleming has used only the “pièces\r\njustificatives,” and has not carried the history beyond the point where\r\nHeusinger left it.\r\n\r\n[97] Continuation of Wm. of Newburgh, Rolls series No. 82, vol.

It fell to be described by two learned writers,\r\nSennert and Horst, of whose accounts a summary is given by Short, _Air,\r\nweather, seasons, etc._ I. 275-285.\r\n\r\n[114] Translated into the _Philosophical Transactions_, No. 130, vol. XII.\r\np. 758 (14 Dec. 1676) from the _Journal des Sçavans_.\r\n\r\n[115] _Studien über den Ergotismus_, Marburg, 1856.\r\n\r\n[116] Simeon of Durham and Roger of Howden have the following, under the\r\nyear 1048: “Mortalitas hominum et animalium multas occupavit Angliae\r\nprovincias, et ignis aereus, vulgo dictus sylvaticus, in Deorbensi\r\nprovincia et quibusdam aliis provinciis, villas et segetes multas\r\nustulavit.”\r\n\r\n[117] “Je crois qu’ils ont voulu indiquer l’ignis sacer ou de St Antoine,\r\nqui dans ces années et surtout 1044 sévit en France.” _Recherches de\r\nPathologie Comparée_, vol. II. p. cxlviii.\r\n\r\n[118] On the other hand, Short, in his _General Chronological History of\r\nthe Air, Weather, Seasons, Meteors etc._ (2 vols. London, 1749) says that\r\nthe epidemic of 1110 consisted of “especially an epidemic erysipelas,\r\nwhereof many died, the parts being black and shrivelled up;” and that in\r\n1128, “St Anthony’s fire was fatal to many in England.” He gives no\r\nauthority in either case. But the one error is run to earth in a French\r\nentry of 1109, “membris instar carbonum nigrescentibus” (Sig. Gembl.\r\nauctar. p. 274, Migne); the other, most likely, in the _ignis_ around\r\nChartres, 1128 (Stephen of Caen, Bouquet, xii. 780).\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is the best place to express a general opinion on the work by\r\nShort, which is the only book of the kind in English previous to my own.\r\nIt is everywhere uncritical and credulous, and often grossly inaccurate in\r\ndates, sometimes repeating the same epidemic under different years. It\r\nappears to have been compiled, for the earlier part, at least, from\r\nforeign sources, such as a Chronicle of Magdeburg, and to a large extent\r\nfrom a work by Colle de Belluno (fl. 1631). Many of the facts about\r\nEnglish epidemics are given almost as in the original chronicles, but\r\nwithout reference to them. English experience of sickness is lost in the\r\ngeneral chronology of epidemics for all Europe, and is dealt with in a\r\npurely verbalist manner. So far as this volume extends (1667) I have found\r\nShort’s book of no use, except now and then in calling my attention to\r\nsomething that I had overlooked. His other work, _New Observations on\r\nCity, Town and County Bills of Mortality_ (London, 1750) shows the author\r\nto much greater advantage, and I have used his statistical tables for the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n[119] The facts were communicated to the Royal Society by Charlton\r\nWollaston, M.D., F.R.S., then resident in Suffolk, and by the Rev. James\r\nBones. They were referred by Dr G. Baker to Tissot of Lausanne, who\r\nreplied that they corresponded to typical gangrenous ergotism. See _Phil.\r\nTrans._ vol. LII. pt. 2 (1762) p. 523, p. 526, p. 529; and vol. LX. (1768)\r\np. 106.\r\n\r\n[120] An erroneous statement as to an epidemic of gangrenous ergotism, or\r\nof Kriebelkrankheit, in England in 1676, has somehow come to be current in\r\nGerman books. It has a place in the latest chronological table of ergotism\r\nepidemics, that of Hirsch in his _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen\r\nPathologie_, vol. II. 1883 (Engl. Transl. II. p. 206), the reference being\r\nto Birch, _Philos. Transact._ This reference to ergotism in England in\r\n1676 is given also in Th. O. Heusinger’s table (1856), where it appears in\r\nthe form of “Schnurrer, nach Birch.” On turning to Schnurrer’s _Chronik\r\nder Seuchen_ (II. 210), the reference is found to be, “Birch, _Phil.\r\nTrans._ vols. XI. and XII.”; and coming at length to the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, it appears that vols. X., XI. and XII. are bound up\r\ntogether, that vol. XII. (1676) p. 758, contains an extract from the\r\n_Journal des Sçavans_ about ergot of rye in certain parts of France, and\r\nthat there is nothing about ergotism in England in either vol. XI. or vol.\r\nXII. So far as concerns Dr Birch, he was secretary to the Royal Society in\r\nthe next century.\r\n\r\n[121] Knighton, _De Eventibus Angliae_ in Twysden, col. 2580: “In aestate\r\nscilicet anno Gratiae 1340 accidit quaedam execrabilis et enormis\r\ninfirmitas in Anglia quasi communis, et praecipue in comitatu Leicestriae\r\nadeo quod durante passione homines emiserunt vocem latrabilem ac si esset\r\nlatratus canum; et fuit quasi intolerabilis poena durante passione: ex\r\ninde fuit magna pestilentia hominum.”\r\n\r\n[122] _Phil.

Angl._\r\nII. 186. Under the same year, 1389, the continuator of Higden’s\r\n_Polychronicon_ (IX. 216) says that the king being in the south and\r\n“seeing some of his prostrated by sudden death, hastened to Windsor.”\r\n\r\n[128] For example in the Sloane MS. 2420 (the treatise by Constantinus\r\nAfricanus of Salerno), there are chapters “De Litargia,” “De Stupore\r\nMentis,” and “De Phrenesi.”\r\n\r\n[129] Th. O. Heusinger, _Studien über den Ergotismus_, Marburg, 1856, p.\r\n35: “Es werden freilich in den Beschreibungen einiger früheren Epidemieen\r\nöfter typhöse Erscheinungen erwähnt; die Beschreiber behaupten aber auch\r\ndann meist die Contagiosität der Krankheit, und es liegt die Vermuthung\r\nnahe, dass die Krankheit dann eigentlich ein Typhus war, bei dem die\r\nErscheinungen des Ergotismus ebenso constant vorkommen, wie sie sonst in\r\nvereinzelteren Fällen dem Typhus sich beigesellen” (cf. ‘Dorf Gossfelden,’\r\nin Appendix).\r\n\r\n[130] _History of Agriculture and Prices_, I. 27.\r\n\r\n[131] “Sed in fructibus arborum suspicio multa fuit, eo quod per nebulas\r\nfoetentes, exhalationes, aerisque varias corruptiones, ipsi fructus, puta\r\npoma, pyra, et hujusmodi sunt infecta; quorum esu multi mortales hoc anno\r\n[1383] vel pestem letalem vel graves morbos et infirmitates incurrerunt.”\r\nWalsingham, _Hist. Angl._ II. 109. The continuator of Higden records under\r\nthe same year, in one place a “great pestilence in Kent which destroyed\r\nmany, and spared no age or sex” (IX. 27), and on another page (IX. 21) a\r\ngreat epidemic in Norfolk, which attacked only the youth of either sex\r\nbetween the ages of seven and twenty-two!\r\n\r\n[132] Walsingham, II. 203; Stow’s _Survey of London_, p. 133.\r\n\r\n[133] The spelling, and a few whole words, have been altered from Skeat’s\r\ntext, so as to make the meaning clear.\r\n\r\n[134] Simpson, _Edin.

Trans. of Royal Society_, XXXI. 58: “Now in a true leprosy\r\nwe never meet with the mention of any disorder in those parts, which, if\r\nthere be not, must absolutely secure the person from having that disease\r\ncommunicated to him by coition with leprous women; but it proves there was\r\na disease among them which was not the leprosy, although it went by that\r\nname; and that this could be no other than venereal because it was\r\ninfectious.”\r\n\r\nHe then quotes from Trevisa’s translation of Bartholomew Glanvile, _De\r\nproprietatibus rerum_, passages which he thinks relate to syphilis,\r\nalthough they are obviously the distinctive signs of lepra taken almost\r\nverbatim from Gilbertus Anglicus. He implies that the later so-called\r\nleper-houses of London were really founded for syphilis when it became\r\nepidemic. In the will of Ralph Holland, merchant taylor, mention is made\r\nof three leper-houses, the Loke, Hackenay and St Giles beyond Holborn\r\nBars, as if these were all that existed in the year 1452. But in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII. there were six of them besides St Giles’s,--Knightsbridge,\r\nHammersmith, Highgate, Kingsland, the Lock, and Mile End; and these, says\r\nBeckett, were used for the treatment of the French pox, which became\r\nexceedingly common after 1494-6.\r\n\r\n[143] Martin, _Histoire de France_, VII. 283.\r\n\r\n[144] One of Gascoigne’s references was copied by Beckett (_Phil.

Jud._ V. 13, 7).\r\nThis was quite understood by early readers of the Gospels; the Syriac New\r\nTestament, translated from the Greek, restores the lost guttural, and uses\r\nthe Syriac form, as employed in _1 Macc._ viii. 17 to render the Greek\r\n’Ελάζαρος. Moreover the Latin and Greek _onomastica_ explain Lazarus as\r\nmeaning ‘adjutus,’ which shows that they took it from (Hebrew) ‘to\r\nhelp’--the second element in the compound Eliezer. The etymology ‘adjutus’\r\n(or the like) ‘helped by God,’ would no doubt powerfully assist in the\r\nchoice of the designation lazars (for lepers). Suicer, in his _Thesaurus_,\r\nquotes a sermon of Theophanes, where it is suggested that every poor man\r\nwho needs help from those who have means might be called a Lazarus.”\r\n\r\nHirsch (_Geog. and Hist. Path._ II. 3) says that the Arabic word for the\r\nfalling sickness comes from the same root (meaning “thrown to the ground”)\r\nas the Hebrew word “sâraat,” which is the term translated “leprosy” in\r\nLeviticus xiii. and xiv. In Isaiah liii. 4, the Vulgate has “et nos\r\nputavimus eum quasi leprosum,” where the English Bible has “yet we did\r\nesteem him stricken.”\r\n\r\n[161] Roger of Howden. Edited by Stubbs.

Y. Simpson has\r\nmade out a table of some hundred leper-houses in Britain (_Edin. Med. and\r\nSurg. Journ._ 1841 and 1842). Simpson’s table has been added to by Miss\r\nLambert in the _Nineteenth Century_, Aug.-Sept. 1884, by the Rev. H. P.\r\nWright (_Leprosy_ etc. 1885), who says at the end of his long list: “There\r\nwere hundreds more,” and by Mr R. C. Hope (_The Leper in England_,\r\nScarborough, 1891), whose list runs to 172.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable development of that verbalist handling of the\r\nmatter has been reserved for a recent medical writer, who has constructed,\r\nfrom the conventional list of leper-hospitals, a map of the _geographical\r\ndistribution of leprosy_ in medieval Britain.

On 1 July,\r\n1371, another bequeaths money to “the three colleges of lepers near\r\nLondon, viz. at _le loke_, at St Giles de Holbourne, and at Hakeney” (p.\r\n147). On 7 April, 1396, bequests are made to “the lepers at le loke near\r\nSeynt Georges barre, of St Giles without Holbournebarre, and le meselcotes\r\nde Haconey” (p. 341). The “lazar house at Knyghtbrigge” appears, for the\r\nfirst time, in a will dated 21 Feb. 1485, along with “the sick people in\r\nthe lazercotes next about London” (p. 589).\r\n\r\n[192] _Accounts of the Lord High-Treasurer of Scotland._ Rolls series I.\r\n1473-1498, pp. 337, 356, 361, 378, 386.\r\n\r\n[193] These are all the so-called “medieval leper-hospitals” collected by\r\nBelcher (_Dubl. Quart. Journ. of Med. Sc._ 1868, August, p. 36) chiefly\r\nfrom Archdall’s _Monasticon Hibernicum_.

The\r\nchronicler has nothing farther to say as to the cause of the leprosy, than\r\nthe opinion of “a certain philosopher,” that whatever turns us from health\r\nto the vices of disease acts by the weight of too much blood, by\r\nsuperfluous heat, by humours exuding in excess, or by the spirits flowing\r\nwith unwonted laxity through silent passages.\r\n\r\n[195] Eadmer, _Vita S.

On y trouvait encore\r\ndes personnes qui s’imposaient une réclusion perpétuelle pour vivre avec\r\nles lépreux et faire leur salut par une vie de soumission aux règles de\r\nl’Église.”\r\n\r\n[198] The ordinance is translated in full from the City archives by H.

Norway has had leprosy in some\r\nprovinces for centuries; and it is significant that William of Malmesbury,\r\nreferring to those who went on the first Crusade, says: “Scotus\r\nfamiliaritatem pulicum reliquit, Noricus cruditatem piscium.” (_Gesta\r\nRegum_, Eng. Hist. Soc.

Little\r\nhas printed, with remarks, in the _English Historical Review_, July, 1890,\r\np. 524, the data submitted to a jury of eighteen who had been empannelled\r\nto settle a dispute between the archdeacon of Richmond and Adam de\r\nKirkham, dean of Amounderness, touching the account rendered by the dean,\r\nas proctor for the archdeacon, of fees received for instituting to vacant\r\nlivings, for probates of wills, and for administration of the goods of\r\nintestates. The dean’s account to the archdeacon is said to run “from the\r\nFeast of the Nativity of our Lady [8 September] in the year of our Lord\r\n1349 unto the eleventh day of January next following;” but it may not\r\nimply, and almost certainly does not, that the vacancies in benefices, the\r\nprobates and the letters of administration, or the corresponding deaths of\r\nindividuals, fell between those dates.

Nine benefices of one kind or another are\r\nmentioned as vacant, three of them twice.

The archdeacon’s whole claim for the 300 was 20\r\nmarcs, which the jury reduced to 10 pounds. Of the alleged 200 intestates\r\nin the same parish, two married couples, one woman, and “Jakke o þe hil”\r\nare named. In the parish of Garstang, the executors of 6 deceased are\r\nnamed, whose probate fees in all amounted to 16 sh. 10 d., the whole claim\r\nof the archdeacon for 400 deceased leaving wills being £10, and the award\r\nof the jury 40 sh. In the parish of Kirkham, on a claim of 20 marcs for\r\nprobate fees not accounted for, “the jury say that he received £4;” on a\r\nclaim of £10 for quittance, the jury say 20 sh. This was a parish in which\r\n3000 are said to have died, the number of wills being not stated. The\r\nnumbers had obviously been put in for a forensic purpose, and are, of\r\ncourse, not even approximately correct for the actual mortality, or the\r\nactual number of wills proved, or of letters of administration granted.\r\nThe awards of the jury amounted in all to £48. 10_s._ See also _Eng.

It appears from a\r\nstatute of 5 Ric. II. that 240 wool-fells were equivalent, for duty, to\r\none sack of wool. In Rogers’ tables, the wool-fell is usually priced at\r\nabout the value of 1½ lbs. of wool, which was at the same time about the\r\naverage clip of a sheep. The present average clip would be at least four\r\ntimes as much. The colonial bale of wool is of the same weight as the\r\nmedieval sack, but would represent 40 to 60 fleeces, instead of about 240.\r\nAt the smallest of the estimates in the text, the wool of 7,680,000 sheep\r\nwould have been exported in a year. Avesbury’s estimate would mean an\r\nannual export to foreign countries of the clip of about 24,000,000 sheep.\r\nThe average price of a sack of wool just before the Black Death was about\r\n£4 in money of the time; the period immediately following the plague was\r\none of low prices; but from 1364 to 1380, the price was uniformly high.\r\n\r\n[338] _Foedera_, III. 186.\r\n\r\n[339] _Ib._ III. 191.\r\n\r\n[340] Jessopp (_l. c._) giving a general reference to the _Foedera_, and\r\nprobably having the Sandwich letter in view, says there was “mad,\r\nunreasoning, insensate panic among well-to-do classes--the trader and the\r\nmoneyed man, the _bourgeoisie_ of the towns,” and “a stampede,”\r\n(presumably to foreign parts). But the mortality was all over by 1st\r\nDecember, 1349; and the exodus, whatever motive it may have had, was\r\nalmost certainly deliberate.\r\n\r\n[341] _Foedera_, III. 198.\r\n\r\n[342] The last clause of the ordinance implies that not only the labourers\r\nbut also the employers of labour were taking the natural advantage of the\r\nsituation. There appears to be some particular evidence of this for\r\nBristol (Rev. W. Hunt, _Bristol_, p. 77): the masters in various crafts\r\nand trades were so reduced in numbers that the survivors could charge what\r\nthey pleased. Thus, the attempt to coerce labourers and skilled workmen\r\nwas a one-sided affair; although, in practice, it related mostly to\r\nfarm-labour, where the one-sidedness did not appear.\r\n\r\n[343] _Foedera_, III. 210.\r\n\r\n[344] _Rot. Parl._ II. 225.\r\n\r\n[345] This was the first parliamentary Statute of Labourers (25 Ed. III.\r\ncap 2). The king’s ordinance of 18th June, 1350 (re-issued for Suffolk and\r\nLindsey on 18th Nov.), is usually reckoned the first Statute of Labourers,\r\nand is invariably assigned to the 23rd year of Edward III., being so\r\nentered in the _Statutes of the Realm_. It is clear, however, from the\r\ntext of the ordinance in the _Foedera_ that it belongs to the 24th of\r\nEdward III., its exact date being 18th June, 1350. Longman, in his\r\n_History of the Life and Times of Edward III._, correctly states in one\r\nplace (I. 309) that the ordinance of 18th June, 1350, was “the first\r\nstep,” but on the very next page, after stating that the ordinance failed,\r\nhe proceeds, according to the usual chronology of 23 Ed. III. and 25 Ed.\r\nIII., to say that “therefore, two years afterwards,” the statute of 25 Ed.\r\nIII. was made in Parliament. The interval was only some eight months.\r\n\r\n[346] _Rot.

All the labour\r\nstatutes were confirmed in the 12th year of Richard II. (cap. 34).\r\nLegislative attempts of the same kind continued to be made as late as the\r\n5th of Elizabeth (1562-3), with particular reference to sturdy beggars.\r\nSee copious extracts from the Statutes in Sir George Nicholls’s _History\r\nof the English Poor Law_, vol. I. Lond. 1854. “An Act for regulating\r\nJourneymen Tailors” was made in 7 Geo. I. (cap. 13).\r\n\r\n[350] “There is no trace of the villenage described in Glanville and\r\nBracton, among the tenants of a manor 500 years ago. All customary\r\nservices were commutable for money payments; all villein tenants were\r\nsecure in the possession of their lands; and the only distinction between\r\nsocage and villein occupation lay in the liberation of the former from\r\ncertain degrading incidents which affected the latter.” Thorold Rogers,\r\n“Effects of the Black Death, &c.” _Fort.

The great landowner ceases to carry on agriculture with his\r\nown capital, and farmers’ rents of a fixed and almost invariable amount\r\ntake the place of the lord’s cultivation by bailiffs. Attempts were made\r\nfor varying periods of time to continue the old system, especially by\r\ncorporations. It is possible that the system of stock and land leasing,\r\nwhich became very general after the change commenced, may have been\r\nsuggested by the hope that the old state of things might be restored....\r\nIn the end all the great landowners conformed to the inevitable change,\r\nand let their land on short leases, and as a rule at low and almost fixed\r\nrents, to capitalist farmers.”\r\n\r\n[367] Thorold Rogers, _op. cit._, I. 376.\r\n\r\n[368] _Rot.

Forestalling of\r\nbutter, cheese and eggs, on the way to market, came before the court in\r\n1418.\r\n\r\n[378] At the manor court in 1417, Thomas Selwin, a butcher, was convicted\r\nof throwing offal and other offensive matters into the common street and\r\nof making his dung-heap there, to the common hurt; also the said Thomas\r\nSelwin “tarde et de novo erexit unam latrinam foetidam in shopa sua ad\r\ncommune nocumentum. Ideo ipse in misericordia.” The next entry of\r\nnuisances, so far as extracts are given, is as late as 1590--various\r\noffences in the street and churchyard, and the glover washing his skins in\r\nthe stream or otherwise befouling the water running by his house.\r\n\r\n[379] Cited in Owen and Blakeway’s _History of Shrewsbury_, II. 524: “per\r\nadvenas qui in dicta villa post ultimam pestilenciam de novo sunt\r\ninhabitati ... at regimen dictae ville ad se attrahere ... machinantes.”\r\nBy the “ultima pestilencia” could hardly have been meant the pestis\r\nsecunda of 1361, the year of the patent, as the learned antiquaries\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n[380] _Rotul.

Typogr._ II. 19) assigns the printing to Machlinia,\r\nand reproduces a page as a sample of his common type. Bliss (_Reliquiae\r\nHearnianae_, II. 117) says that this sample page does not correspond with\r\nthat of the British Museum copy. He adds that there is a fragment of the\r\nprinted book in the library of St Peter’s College, Cambridge, “pasted\r\nwithin the wooden covers of the binding of an edition (1499) of _Discipuli\r\nSermones_.”\r\n\r\n[400] In the earliest printed Latin texts of this work (Antwerp, 1485?\r\nLeipzig, 1495? and versified in Albertus Magnus, ‘De Virtute Herbarum,’\r\n1500?) he is named Kamitus, bishop of Arusia, a city in the realm of\r\nDenmark. In the copy of the English version in the British Museum, someone\r\nhas called him Ramicius, having written on a leaf, “Ramicius Episcopus\r\nArusiensis civitatis Daciae Regimen contra pestem,” with the date 1698.\r\nThe name of Kamitus, being judged improbable on the face of it, has been\r\nchanged in the catalogue of the British Museum library into Canutus. But\r\nthere was no Canutus among the bishops of Aarhus, nor a Kamitus, nor a\r\nRamicius. The two bishops that appear to suit best are Olaus, or Olaf, who\r\nwas bishop from 1371 to 1388, and Ulricus or Udalricus, or Olric Stycka,\r\nwho succeeded in 1425 and held the see until 1449. Curiously enough, the\r\nlatter, when he went to Rome in 1425 to represent Eric, king of Pomerania\r\nin a suit with the dukes of Sleswig, figures throughout the records of the\r\nsuit as “Olaus, episcopus Arosiensis,” although Olaus, bishop of Arusia,\r\nbelonged to a former generation. It is, of course, the merest guessing;\r\nbut I am inclined to think that the author of the essay on plague was\r\neither bishop Olaus, of 1371-1388, or bishop Udalricus, of 1425-1449, a\r\nman of character and ability, who also went by the name of Olaus; and that\r\nin any case the manuscript version of the essay in the English tongue is\r\nmore likely to have been of the early part of the fifteenth century than\r\nof the fourteenth. The above facts are collected from various parts of\r\nLangbeck’s _Script. Rer. Dan._: the “Series Episcoporum Arhusiorum” is in\r\nvol. VII. p. 212. Nothing is there said of any bishop of Aarhus having\r\nwritten a book, or having been a physician at Montpellier.\r\n\r\n[401] These words (“the impressions”) are contracted in the printed book,\r\nexactly as in the manuscript. I have modernised the spelling for the most\r\npart.\r\n\r\n[402] “When a man feeleth himself infect, as soon as he may, let him be\r\nlet blood plenteously till he swoon: then stop the vein. For a little\r\nletting of blood moveth or stirreth venom.... Let him blood on the side of\r\nthe body where the swelling appeareth. Therefore if a swelling appear\r\nunder the right arm, let blood in the middle of the same arm, in the vein\r\ncalled _mediana_. If it appear under the left arm, let him blood in midst\r\nof the same, or in the vein of the liver which is about the little finger.\r\nAnd if it be about the share, let him blood about the heel upon the same\r\nside. If the swelling be in the neck, let him blood in the vein called\r\n_cephalica_, about the thumb in the hand of the same side; or in the vein\r\nthe which is called _mediana_ of the same arm, or in the hand of the same\r\nside about the little finger. And, overmore, if the swelling appear about\r\nthe ear, let him blood in the vein called _cephalica_ of the same side, or\r\nin the vein which is between the long finger and the thumb, lest many\r\nvenomous things go into the brain.” If the swelling is in the shoulders,\r\nbleed from the _mediana_: if on the back from _pedica magna_, and so on.\r\n\r\n[403] Walsingham, _Hist. Angl._ I. 309. Adam of Murimuth, Engl. Hist. Soc.\r\n\r\n[404] The Stratford bread-carts are explained in Stow’s _Survey of London_\r\n(“Lime Street Ward”). In the famines of 1512 and 1527, they were besieged\r\non the way by hungry citizens and had to be guarded. The same phrase of\r\nbread being “gesen” or scarce, occurs in a letter of 4 September, 1535,\r\nfrom Thomas Broke to Cromwell, secretary of State: “never knew good bread\r\nso geason in London at this time of the year; it is so musty, and of so\r\nevil wheat, that it is rather poisonous than nourishing; what was sold for\r\na halfpenny, when you were here, is now a penny.” (_Cal.

(no. 863, fol. 107) of the time of Charles\r\nI., the duration of the _pestis tertia_ as 2 July--29 Sept., 1369, which\r\nshould probably read “2 July, 1368--29 Sept. 1369.”\r\n\r\n[409] _Memorials of London_, etc. from the Council Records.

Some\r\nof the enumerations are clearly erroneous. Thus in _A Short English\r\nChronicle_ from the Lambeth MS. (ed. Gairdner for the Camden Society,\r\n1880), the plague of 1361 is erroneously called “the threde pestilence,”\r\nwhile the fourth is assigned to 1369 and the fifth to 1377 (for 1375).\r\nOtterbourne places the _quarta_ in 1374 (for 1375), and the _quinta_ (as\r\nothers do) in 1391; but in the _Life of Richard II._, by a monk of\r\nEvesham, the pestilence of 1382 is more correctly reckoned the fifth from\r\nthe Black Death.\r\n\r\n[412] Walsingham, _Hist.

A great\r\nmortality increased in Norfolk and in many other counties in England, and\r\nit seemed not unlike the season of the great pestilence: it was occasioned\r\nby a great want of victuals, that forced many people to eat unwholesome\r\nfood, and so brought distempers upon them. This dearth began under the\r\nsickle, and lasted to the following harvest [1391], but was not so much\r\nfor want of corn, as money to purchase it, occasioned by the law made in\r\nrelation to wool, by which wool became dog-cheap; for a stone of chosen\r\nand picked wool of the best sort was sold for 3 sh. and some for 22 pence\r\nor 2 sh., so that in these times the woollen manufacture was the great\r\nsupport of the nation.” According to Thorold Rogers, these high prices of\r\nwool obtained from 1364 to 1380.\r\n\r\n[425] Walsingham, II. 203. The Continuator of Higden (IX. 259) says\r\n12,000. These estimates are, of course, the merest guesses, and extreme\r\nexaggerations.

The facts given in the next few pages may be taken\r\nas coming from the Calendar of State Papers, under their respective dates,\r\nunless it is otherwise stated in the notes.\r\n\r\n[495] This appears to have been a common direction. In a letter of 12\r\nAugust, 1517, dated from the Fleet Prison by Thomas Leeke to his brother\r\nsir John Leeke (_Hist. MSS. Commission Reports_, X. pt. 4, p. 447), the\r\nwriter says he has been sore vexed with the sweat and in danger of life:\r\n“If any of you have it, pray you to keep well and close about your breasts\r\nand your heart for twenty-four hours and then with God’s grace there is no\r\ndanger in it: there has been a marvellous great death for so short a\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n[496] In the letter of 12 August from the Fleet Prison, already quoted\r\n(_Hist. MSS. Reports_, _l. c._), it is stated that fifteen are dead in the\r\nCardinal’s house, including Mr Cowper, the steward, Talboys, lord of Kyme,\r\nyoung Wastness, and one Grenell. In my lord of Durham’s house, Dr Port and\r\nDr Fysche are dead, with divers others. Of the Court, my lord Clinton, Mr\r\nMorgan, steward to the Queen, and one Mat. Jones, of the King’s wardrobe,\r\nwere buried at Richmond on Friday last, and divers more of the Court are\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n[497] _The Pitiful Life of King Edward the Fifth_: “Considering there is,\r\nas physicians say, and as we also find, double the peril in the relapse\r\nthat was in the first sickness,” p. 230.

State Papers_) reads the letter, “On Tuesday one of\r\nthe ladies of the chamber, Mlle de Boulan, was infected with the sweat.”\r\nBut P. Friedmann (_Anne Boleyn_, Lond. 1884, I. 72) says the correct\r\nreading is a fille-de-chambre of Mlle de Boulan; and it is known that Anne\r\nBoleyn did not take the sweat until some days after.\r\n\r\n[502] In the _History of Cork_ by C. Smith, M.D. (2nd ed., 1774) there is\r\nan entry under 1528: “a malignant disorder called the sweating sickness in\r\nCork,” with a reference to “MS. annals.” It has been generally supposed\r\nthat the sweat did not enter Ireland or Scotland in any of its five\r\noutbreaks.\r\n\r\n[503] The German writers have assumed that the sweat was prevalent abroad\r\nreally in the same summer or autumn as in England, explaining the\r\ndiscrepant dates by the difference in the English calendar. But it was\r\nonly the months of January and February, and March to the 24th, that were\r\ncounted in the old year in England; the months of June, July, August, etc.\r\nin which the sweat occurred, are the same in the English and foreign\r\ncalendar-years. In the English chronology of the sweat, those months\r\nbelong quite clearly to the year 1528; and, in the German, Swiss, and\r\nNetherlands chronology of the sweat, just as clearly to the year 1529. The\r\nsweat on the Continent was a year later than in England.\r\n\r\n[504] Gruner’s _Scriptores de sudore Anglico superstites_ was reprinted by\r\nHäser, with additional citations and notes, in 1847. Hecker (_Der\r\nEnglische Schweiss_, 1834) refers to the work by Gruner, _Itinerarium\r\nsudoris Anglici ex actis designatum_, Jena, 1805, which I have been unable\r\nto see. The account of the German invasion in the text is accordingly at\r\nsecond-hand.\r\n\r\n[505] _A boke or counseill against the Sweate_, London, 1552. _De Ephemera\r\nBritannica_, London, 1555.\r\n\r\n[506] “This yere the swetinge sycknes raignyd in England, and began first\r\nin this towne of Shrowsbery the xxii of Marche, and ran through the\r\nrealme, and began in London the ixth of July.” Quoted from MS.

New ed. 1596, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[526] There is a single reference to a sweat on the Continent in 1551,\r\nwhich may really have been one of those epidemics of typhus (or\r\ninfluenza), with a sweating character, that were observed in 1557-8 and\r\n1580. Brassavolus, writing _de morbo Gallico_, and illustrating the fact\r\nthat epidemics were sometimes generated by drought (though mostly by\r\nhumidity), says that the sweat in England, in former years, came with\r\ndrought, and that at the time of his writing, the 15th September, 1551,\r\nthat disease was vexing Flanders,--the season being extremely dry,--and\r\nhad attacked many thousands. This was first noticed by Häser, _Op. cit._\r\nIII. (1882), p. 332. The reference to Brassavolus is Luisini’s _Script. de\r\nlue venerea_. Lugd.

The writer on “Sweating Sickness” in the\r\n_Encycl. Brit._ has adopted it as a common-place; it is obvious enough\r\nwhen pointed out, but Hecker had not done so.\r\n\r\n[533] The above account is summarised from the chapter in Hirsch, _Geog.\r\nand Histor.

In the last great plague, more died about\r\nthere than in three parishes besides; these fields are the chiefest walks\r\nfor recreation of the cityzens, and though the ditch were cast every\r\nsecond year, yet the water coming from the kennel and slaughter-houses\r\nwill be very contagious. It is no material defence for the city, and half\r\nthe ditch has been stopped these many years.”\r\n\r\n[703] _London’s Remembrancer_, by John Bell, Clerk of the Company of\r\nParish Clerks. London, 1665. He says: “I shall begin with the year 1593,\r\nbeing the first year in which any account of the christenings and burials\r\nwas kept. I cannot find any record of more antiquity than that of this\r\nyear in the Company of Parish Clerks Hall.” However we can now point to\r\noriginal weekly bills of mortality of 1532 and 1535, to abstracts of\r\nweekly plague-burials in 1563-66, to the figures from one weekly bill of a\r\nseries in 1574, and to abstracts of 1578-83.\r\n\r\n[704] The total of 25,886 was copied, probably from the broadside of 1603,\r\ninto an anonymous essay of 1665, called _Reflections on the Bills of\r\nMortality_, the total of plague alone being given as 11,503, evidently by\r\na misprint for 15,003. At the same time a table was given, professing to\r\nbe of the weekly deaths from all causes, in one column, and from plague in\r\nanother, from March 13 to December 18, 1593. The column of plague-deaths\r\nsums up to 11,110, but the total of 11,503 (which originated in a\r\nmisprint) is printed at the foot of the column as if that were the\r\nsummation. The column of deaths from all causes is made to sum up to\r\n25,886, the actual sum being 25,817. But the weekly mortalities in it for\r\nthose weeks that had little plague are an absurdity for 1593. Whatever the\r\nsource of this table, it is not genuine for 1593, and was disclaimed by\r\nBell, the clerk of Parish Clerks’ Hall, whose essay was written in 1665 to\r\ncorrect that and other errors about former plagues in London.\r\n\r\n[705] _Cal.

L. p. 699) it is printed, with remarks, by Tho. Birch, D.D., Sec.

Quod etiam eodem tempore, regnante tum\r\nEdwardo sexto, Cantabrigiae evenit, cum duo simul liberi ducis inclyti\r\nSuffolchiae ibi morerentur. Nec tamen Oxonienses ulli fere interierunt,\r\nquod coeli constitutio apud nos quam ibi salubrior sit. Sed iis ita\r\nsuccurrendum morbis putamus, ut Brittanico sudore (sic enim vocant)\r\nopitulari solemus.”\r\n\r\n[791] Anthony Wood, as we have seen in the text, put together his version\r\nof the fever of 1577 from the Merton College register, from Stow’s\r\n_Annals_, and from Ethredge’s reference to the sweat of 1551. In 1758,\r\nJohn Ward, LL.D., copied the passage in the Merton register and sent it to\r\nthe Royal Society; whose secretary, the Rev. Dr Thomas Birch, appended to\r\nit in the _Philosophical Transactions_ some annotations--“copying,” as\r\nCarlyle said of him with reference to some Cromwell matter, “from Wood’s\r\n_Athenae_; and has committed--as who does not?--several errors,” his\r\nannotations being “sedulous but ineffectual”--to the extent of fixing on\r\nthe original correct narrative an accretion of mistakes (600 for 60,\r\nsweating sickness for gaol fever, &c.). Trusting to the respectable Birch,\r\nBancroft in his _Essay on the Yellow Fever, with observations concerning\r\nfebrile contagion &c._ (Lond., 1811) has based a theory that the Oxford\r\nepidemic was not typhus at all. Murchison (_Continued Fevers of Great\r\nBritain_, 2nd ed. 1873, p. 103) has also been misled, and has found\r\nhimself therefore at a disadvantage in answering Bancroft’s empty\r\nverbalisms about the invariable reproduction of typhus from some previous\r\ncase. F. C. Webb, in a paper “An Historical Account of the Gaol Fever,”\r\n_Trans. Epidem. Soc._ for 1857, p. 63, has not used the Oxford case for\r\nany argumentative purpose, but he has, like the others, given the facts\r\nerroneously. He gives no particulars of the Exeter Black Assize.\r\n\r\n[792] Howard, _On Lazarettos in Europe_, &c. Warrington, 1789, p. 231:\r\n“But as I have found, in some prisons abroad, cells and dungeons as\r\noffensive and dirty as any I have observed in this country, where however\r\nthe distemper was unknown, I am obliged to look out for some additional\r\ncause of its production. I am of opinion that the sudden change of _diet_\r\nand lodging so affects the _spirits_ of _new_ convicts that the general\r\ncauses of putrid fever exert an immediate effect upon them. Hence it is\r\ncommon to see them sicken and die in a short time with very little\r\napparent illness.” The last words are important.\r\n\r\n[793] _Sylva Sylvarum, or A Natural History._ In ten centuries.

New edition by Hoker, London, 1587, pp.\r\n1547-8.\r\n\r\n[795] These statements by Hoker, chamberlain of Exeter, are sufficiently\r\ncircumstantial; but they do not quite suit the theory of a writer in the\r\n_Dict. Nat. Biog._, under “Drake, Sir Bernard” that the ship was “a great\r\nPortugal ship,” called the Lion of Viana, with an English master, taken by\r\nBernard Drake in Brittany. No doubt such a capture is stated in the _Cal.\r\nState Papers_, 1585, p. 295 (the reference given), Sir W. Raleigh’s ship\r\nthe “Jobe” being included in the same petition; but nothing is said of\r\nDartmouth as the port to which the two vessels were brought, or of Exeter\r\nas the place where their captains were imprisoned. It is of importance for\r\nthe theory of the Exeter gaol fever to know whether Drake’s prisoners were\r\nPortuguese fishermen or not, and Hoker may be supposed to have known.\r\n\r\n[796] The author of the misadventure. He succeeded in getting home to\r\nCrediton, where he died on the 12th April, four weeks after the Assizes\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n[797] Sir George Nicholls, in his _History of the English Poor Law_, 1854,\r\nI. 113, threw out the suggestion that the decay was in the old walled\r\ntowns, and that it was compensated by the rise of populations on less\r\nhampered sites. This theory has been adopted by some later writers.\r\n\r\n[798] _Calendar of State Papers._ Domestic, Hen. VIII.\r\n\r\n[799] Becon’s _Works_, 3 vols.

G.\r\nNichols, xxiv.\r\n\r\n[802] Strype’s ed. of Stow’s _Survey of London_.\r\n\r\n[803] In the Rolls of the Middlesex Sessions (Middlesex Record Society),\r\nthere occur numerous entries of inquests on deaths in the gaol of Newgate\r\nfrom the 25th year of Elizabeth: a few of these are from plague; but by\r\nfar the larger number are from “the pining sickness,” a malady which\r\nsometimes cut off several prisoners in the same few days and after a brief\r\nillness. In one of these epidemics (Dec. 1586-Feb. 1587), a single case is\r\ncalled “pestilent fever,” the other seven being “pining sickness.” Next\r\nyear, June 19, there is a case of bloody flux, and, on June 24, a case of\r\n“pining sickness.” The other periods when the disease so named was\r\nepidemic in Newgate were Feb.-May, 1595, June and July, 1597, March, 1598,\r\nand March-April, 1602. The pining sickness was probably a generic term,\r\nand may have included chronic disease; there is a solitary case entered as\r\nailing for as long a period as eight months, the usual duration of the\r\nsickness being one, two, or three days up to three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nThis place will serve to notice the strange teaching about “parish\r\ninfection” which has received currency among the writers of good repute as\r\nauthorities. Guy (_Public Health_, Lectures, 1870, I. 23) says the gaol\r\ndistemper was an old offender known as the _sickness of the house_: “I\r\nthink I recognize it in the London Bills from 1606 to 1665 as the _Parish\r\nInfection_.” The column of figures in the London Bills which has been\r\ntaken to show the weekly prevalence of a disease, otherwise unheard of,\r\n“parish infection,” really shows the number of “parishes infected.” The\r\nearlier bills showed, in the corresponding column, the number of parishes\r\nclear (“parish.clere” or “paroch.clere”). By adding up the number of\r\nparishes infected in each of the 52 weeks of a bad plague-year, a total of\r\nsome thousands is got, and that total has been taken to be the annual\r\nmortality from “parish infection”--a pure myth. The original author of\r\nthis singular mistake appears to have been Marshall, in his _Mortality of\r\nthe Metropolis_, London, 1832, p. 67. Of the “parish infection,” he says:\r\n“The disease below is specified by Mr Bell in his _Remembrancer_ [1665];\r\nit is probably the same as exhibited under the name of spotted fever.”\r\nWhat Bell “specifies” is not another disease, but the number of parishes\r\nin the City and suburbs infected with the plague in each week of the year.\r\n\r\n[804] _Annales Monastici_, Rolls series, No. 19. Chronicle by an unknown\r\nauthor (St Albans) temp. Hen. VI., 1422-31:--“Quaedam infirmitas reumigata\r\ninvasit totum populum, quae _mure_ dicitur: et sic senes cum junioribus\r\ninficiebat quod magnum numerum ad funus letale deducebat.”\r\n\r\nIn the Report of the Irish Local Government Board, Medical Department,\r\n1890, influenza is identified under the name “slaedan,” or prostration,\r\nwhich was epidemic in Ireland in 1326 or 1328, the same epidemic being\r\ncalled “murre” in the _Annals of Clonmacnoise_. The use of the word “mure”\r\nin the St Albans Chronicle is just a century later. Murrain (or _morena_\r\nin Latin chronicles) is probably the modern survival of “mure” or “murre.”\r\n\r\n[805] I take this summary from Short (_Chronology_, etc. I. 204), who\r\nomits his authority, probably the foreign writers to whom he is usually\r\nindebted in the earlier period. The first part of Theophilus Thompson’s\r\n_Annals of Influenza_ (Sydenham Society) is little else than extracts from\r\nShort, and therefore of foreign origin.\r\n\r\n[806] _Cal. State Papers._ Domestic, _sub dato_.\r\n\r\n[807] Thus in the continuation of Fabyan’s Chronicle under the year 1512,\r\nthe Marquis of Dorset, sent into Spain with 10,000 men, is said to have\r\n“returned in winter by reason of the flix (dysentery).” And in Hall’s\r\n_Chronicle_ (ed. of 1807, p. 523), we have particulars of the very serious\r\nsickness in his army in Biscay; owing to their diet being largely of\r\ngarlic and fruits, and their drink being hot wines in hot weather, “there\r\nfell sick 3000 of the flix, and thereof died 1800 men.”\r\n\r\n[808] Continuator of Fabyan’s _Chronicle_, sub anno. There is an almost\r\nidentical entry in _A London Chronicle of Henry VII. and Henry VIII._\r\n(Camden Miscellany, vol. V. 1859), but under the year 1539, in a hot and\r\ndry summer. The most discrepant date and designation of the epidemic of\r\nthose years are those given in Hardiman’s _History of Galway_ (p. 40):\r\n“This charitable institution [St Bridget’s Hospital] was fortunately\r\ncompleted in the year 1543, when the sweating sickness broke out, and\r\nraged with great violence, destroying multitudes of the natives, and\r\nparticularly the tradesmen of the town.”\r\n\r\n[809] The term “hot ague” occurs as early as 1518, in a letter of 18 July\r\n(_Cal.

The same kind of misdating occurs among the printed letters of\r\nErasmus.\r\n\r\n[862] This letter is printed in his _Opuscula_, Papiae, 1496.

London, 1885.\r\n\r\n[873] The South-African controversy, which became acute, was carried on in\r\njournals of the colony (the _South African Medical Journal_ about 1883 and\r\n1884 is a likely source of information), but some echoes of it were heard\r\nin letters to the _British Medical Journal_, 1884. A few years ago a\r\nsimilar diagnostic difficulty arose, not in an African race, but among the\r\ninmates of a Paris hospital. In the smallpox wards of the Hôpital St\r\nAntoine, a number of cases occurred, one of them in a nurse, another in an\r\nassistant physician, of a particular skin-disease, which was either\r\ndiscrete or confluent, lasted about ten days, and was attended by fever up\r\nto 40° C. or 41° C. Yet these cases were discriminated from smallpox; they\r\nwere diagnosed, and have been recorded, as an epidemic of ecthyma. (Du\r\nCastel, _Gazette des Hôpitaux_, 1881, No. 122, quoted in the\r\n_Jahresbericht_.)\r\n\r\n[874] _Krankheiten des Orients._ Erlangen, 1847, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[875] _History of Physic_, II. 190.\r\n\r\n[876] Gruner, a learned professor of Jena, who made collections of works\r\nor passages relating to syphilis and to the English sweat, published also\r\nin 1790 a collection of medieval chapters or sentences on smallpox, “De\r\nVariolis et Morbillis fragmenta medicorum Arabistarum,” including the\r\nwhole of Gaddesden’s chapter but omitting the earlier and more important\r\nchapter from Gilbert. Gruner correctly says at the end of his extracts:\r\n“while the Arabists write thus, they seem to have followed their Arabic\r\nguides, and to have repeated what they received from the latter.” This is\r\nobvious from the text of the chapters themselves: some quote more often\r\nthan others from Avicenna, Rhazes and Isaac; but it is clear that they all\r\nbase upon the Arabians. The substance is the same in them all; it is a\r\nmerely verbal handling of Arabic observation and theory. There are no\r\nconcrete experiences or original additions, from which one might infer\r\nthat they were familiar at first hand with smallpox and measles. Häser,\r\nhowever, seems to take these chapters in the medieval compends as evidence\r\nof the general prevalence of smallpox in Europe in the Middle Ages. As he\r\nfinds little writing about smallpox when modern medical literature began,\r\nhe is driven into the paradox that epidemics of smallpox had actually\r\nbecome rarer again in the sixteenth century (III. p. 69). But the\r\nsixteenth-century references to smallpox, although they are indeed scanty,\r\nare at the same time the earliest authentic accounts of it in Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[877] This intention is most clearly expressed by Valescus de Tharanta:\r\n“Then let him be wrapped in a woollen cloth of Persian, or at least of\r\nred, so that by the sight of the red cloth the blood may be led to the\r\nexterior and so be kept at no excessive heat, according to the tenour of\r\nthe sixth canon [of Avicenna].” _Apud_ Gruner, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[878] _History of Physic_, Pt.

(108),\r\nand Passus vii.\r\n\r\n[883] Trench, in his _Select Glossary_, has adopted the derivation of\r\nmeasles from _misellus_, without apparently knowing that John of Gaddesden\r\nhad actually used “mesles” for a form of _morbilli_. The derivation of\r\nmeasles from _misellus_ has been summarily rejected by Skeat, who thinks\r\nthat “the spelling with the simple vowel _e_, instead of _ae_ or _ea_,\r\nmakes all the difference. The confusion between the words is probably\r\nquite modern.” Perhaps I ought not to contradict a philologist on his own\r\nground; but there is no help for it. I know of four instances in which the\r\nsimple vowel _e_ is used in spelling the name of the disease that is\r\nassociated with smallpox, the English equivalent of _morbilli_. In a\r\nletter of July 14, 1518, from Pace, dean of St Paul’s to Wolsey (_Cal.\r\nState Papers_, Henry VIII. II. pt. 1), it is said, “They do die in these\r\nparts [Wallingford] in every place, not only of the small pokkes and\r\nmezils, but also of the great sickness.” In the _Description of the Pest_\r\nby Dr Gilbert Skene, of Edinburgh (Edin. 1568, reprinted for the Bannatyne\r\nClub, 1840, p. 9), he mentions certain states of weather “quhilkis also\r\nsignifeis the Pokis, Mesillis and siclik diseisis of bodie to follow.” And\r\nif a Scotsman’s usage be not admitted, an Oxonian, Cogan, says, “when the\r\nsmall pockes and mesels are rife,” and another Oxonian, Thomas Lodge, in\r\nhis _Treatise of the Plague_ (London, 1603, Cap. iii.) says: “When as\r\nFevers are accompanied with Small Poxe, Mesels, with spots,” etc. On the\r\nother hand, Elyot, in the _Castel of Health_ (1541), Phaer in the _Book of\r\nChildren_, (1553), Clowes in his _Proved Practice_, and Kellwaye (1593)\r\nwrite the word with _ea_. There is, indeed, no uniformity, just as one\r\nmight have expected in the sixteenth century. Again, Shakespeare\r\n(_Coriolanus_, Act III., scene I) spells the word with _ea_ where it is\r\nclearly the same word that is used in _The Vision of Piers the Ploughman_\r\nin a generic sense and in the spelling of “meseles:”--“Those meazels which\r\nwe disdain should tetter us.” Lastly, there are not two words in the\r\nElizabethan dictionaries, one with _e_ signifying lepers, and another with\r\n_ea_ signifying the disease of _morbilli_. In Levins’ _Manipulus\r\nVocabulorum_, we find “ye Maysilles” = _variolae_, but there is no word\r\n“mesles” = _leprosi_. There was only one word, with the usual varieties of\r\nspelling; and in course of time it came to be restricted in meaning to\r\n_morbilli_, Gaddesden’s early use of “mesles” in that sense having\r\ndoubtless helped to determine the usage.\r\n\r\n[884] _Harl. MS._, No. 2378. So far as I have observed, there is no\r\nprescription for “mesles,” or for smallpox under its Latin name or under\r\nany English name that might correspond thereto. Moulton’s _This is The\r\nMyrror or Glasse of Helth_ (? 1540), which reproduces these medieval\r\nprescriptions with their headings, is equally silent about smallpox and\r\nmeasles.\r\n\r\n[885] Willan’s _Miscellaneous Works_. “An Inquiry into the Antiquity of\r\nthe Smallpox, Measles, and Scarlet Fever.” London, 1821, p. 98.

His _Opera Medica_ contain ordinary cases treated by him in\r\nLondon in December, 1625, but there is no mention of plague-cases.\r\nWoodall’s essay on plague, published in 1639, thus refers to his\r\nexperience in the epidemic of 1625: “In anno 1625 we had many signes\r\ncontrarie to the plagues in other times; yea, and many did dye dayly\r\nwithout any signes or markes on their bodies at all.”\r\n\r\n[1017] _C. and T.

In a petition relating to Farnham, Jan.\r\n1628, the town is described as being “impoverished through the plague and\r\nmany charges,” which may mean that plague had been diffused in Surrey and\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\n[1030] _Cal.

This he did because he was a strong man and\r\nheavier than his said nephew and another wench were able to bury. He died\r\nabout the 24th of August. Thus much was I credibly tould. He died 1625.\r\n\r\n“John Dawson, son of the above-mentioned Thomas, came unto his father when\r\nhis father sent for him being sick, and having laid him down in a ditch\r\ndied in it the 29th day of August, 1625, in the night.\r\n\r\n“Rose Smyth, servant of the above-named Thomas Dawson, and last of that\r\nhousehold, died of the plague and was buried by Wm.

Shortened in\r\nHakluyt, III. 542. The earlier part of the narrative is by Captain Bigges,\r\nand, after his death in the West Indies, by his lieutenant, Croftes.\r\n\r\n[1132] Mr Froude (_History_, XII. 150) must be pronounced somewhat happy\r\nin his bold guess of “yellow fever.” At the same time the enthymeme by\r\nwhich he had reached his conclusion is altogether wrong: first, in\r\nassuming that the infection “broke out” after the capture of Cartagena,\r\nignoring the fact of its disastrous prevalence in mid-ocean two or three\r\nmonths before, shortly after leaving the Cape de Verde islands; and\r\nsecondly in assuming that the yellow fever for which Cartagena and other\r\nharbours of the Spanish Main became notorious in later times had existed\r\nas an infection there in the 16th century.\r\n\r\n[1133] Sir Richard Hawkins, who commanded the galliot ‘Duck’ in Drake’s\r\nexpedition of 1585, thus refers to the Cape de Verde islands, on the\r\noccasion of touching there in his own expedition to the Pacific in 1593\r\n(Purchas, IV. 1368):\r\n\r\nThese islands are “one of the most unhealthiest climates in the world. In\r\ntwo times that I have been in them, either cost us the one half of our\r\npeople, with fevers and fluxes of sundry kinds, some shaking, some\r\nburning, some partaking of both; some possesst with frensie, others with\r\nslouth; and in one of them it cost me six months’ sickness, with no small\r\nhazard of life.” He then gives a reason for the great risk to health: the\r\nnorth-east breeze about four in the afternoon seldom faileth, “coming cold\r\nand fresh, and finding the pores of the body open and for the most part\r\nnaked, penetrateth the very bones, and so causeth sudden distemperature,\r\nand sundry manners of sickness, as the subjects are divers whereupon they\r\nwork. Departing out of the calmes of the Islands, and coming into the\r\nfresh breeze, it causeth the like; and I have seen within two days after\r\nthat we have partaked of the fresh air, of two thousand men above an\r\nhundred and fifty have been crazed in their health.” This seems to refer\r\nto the epidemic in Drake’s fleet, as given in the text; but it is clearly\r\nan imperfect account of the facts, and in theory altogether improbable, as\r\na trade wind within the tropic cannot be credited with such effects, even\r\nif the forms of sickness were conceivably due at all to chill.\r\n\r\nDarwin (_Naturalist’s Voyage in the Beagle_, p. 366) says: “The island of\r\nSt Jago, at the Cape de Verde, offers another strongly-marked instance of\r\na country, which anyone would have expected to find most healthy, being\r\nvery much the contrary. I have described the bare and open plains as\r\nsupporting, during a few weeks after the rainy season, a thin vegetation,\r\nwhich directly withers away and dries up; at this period the air appears\r\nto become quite poisonous; both natives and foreigners often being\r\naffected with violent fevers. On the other hand, the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago, in the Pacific, with a similar soil, and periodically subject\r\nto the same process of vegetation, is perfectly healthy.” But the\r\nGalapagos have been uninhabited, except in recent times by two or three\r\nhundred people banished from Ecuador. On the other hand the Cape de Verde\r\nislands are believed to have been at one time well wooded and not\r\nunfertile; and the Portuguese settlements in them, to say nothing of the\r\nnative negro villages, had a fair population. It is not easy to understand\r\nthe pernicious character of their fevers without assuming that spots of\r\nsoil had become pestilential by human occupancy; but it is at the same\r\ntime clear that a degree of befouling of the soil which would be innocuous\r\nin ordinary, would there engender deadly miasmata owing to the remarkable\r\nalternations of drought and wetness under a tropical sun.\r\n\r\n[1134] Hakluyt, III. 286.\r\n\r\n[1135] Mr Hubert Hall, of the Record Office, in _Society in the\r\nElizabethan Age_.

Laughton (_Dict. of National Biography._ Art. “Hawkins,\r\nSir Richard”) points out that Hawkins’s narrative of the ‘Daintie’s’\r\nvoyage had not always been authenticated by reference to notes or\r\ndocuments. It seems probable also, from his remarks on the epidemic in\r\nDrake’s fleet after leaving the Cape de Verde islands in 1585, that he\r\ntrusted his memory too much. But that objection of writing from memory has\r\nno force as against his general observations and reflections on scurvy.\r\n\r\n[1141] Purchas, part IV. p. 1877.\r\n\r\n[1142] _Ibid._ p. 1623.\r\n\r\n[1143] Woodall defends the use of biscuit in his _Surgeon’s Mate_,\r\npublished in 1617.\r\n\r\n[1144] Purchas, III. 847.\r\n\r\n[1145] _The Voyages of Sir James Lancaster, Knight, to the East Indies._\r\nHakluyt Society, ed.

[Syphilis was prevalent in Barcelona and Valencia\r\nprevious to 1494. See Chapter VIII.] Soon after, in the year 1496, began\r\nthe disease to arrest some courtiers; but in those beginnings it was only\r\namongst baser persons of small authority; and it was thought that they got\r\nit by having to do with common women. But afterwards it extended to\r\nprincipal persons, and the physicians could not tell what to think of it,\r\nso that many died.’... But indeed it came from Hispaniola, where it is\r\nordinary, and the remedy also [guaiacum]. _Our author_ (_l. c._ civ.), and\r\nRamusio in his preface to his third Tome, say that the souldiers of\r\nPamfilo de Nuney, having the small pocks, infected the Indians which never\r\nbefore heard of that disease; in so much that of 1,600,000 soules in that\r\nisland there are so few left, as by and by you shall hear....

Also\r\nObservations taken from an original Manuscript of a graduate physician,\r\nwho resided in London during the whole time of the late plague, anno\r\n1665._ London 1721 (and two more editions the same year). The title-page\r\nof this astute gentleman is of the catch-penny order. All that is said of\r\nthe original manuscript occupies about the same number of lines in the\r\ntext as in the title, and might have been extracted in the course of five\r\nminutes’ research; it consists merely of a list of a few things supposed\r\nto be distinctive signs of plague--extraordinary inward heat, difficulty\r\nof breathing, pain and heaviness in the head, inclination to sleep,\r\nfrequent vomiting, immoderate thirst, dryness of the tongue and palate,\r\nand then the risings, swellings, or buboes. Boghurst’s third chapter is\r\noccupied with twenty-one such signs, and his fourth chapter with a hundred\r\nmore signs and circumstances, in numbered paragraphs. It is possible that\r\nhis was the manuscript out of which the botanist made capital in his\r\ntitle-page; but his meagre list of signs might have been got from almost\r\nany work on almost any febrile disorder, and is not sufficient to identify\r\nBoghurst by, although a word or phrase here and there is the same.\r\nHowever, Defoe would have seen Bradley’s title-page, and might have\r\ninquired after the Sloane MS.\r\n\r\n[1202] Of the six plague-deaths in 1664, three were in Whitechapel parish,\r\nand one each in Aldgate, Cripplegate and St Giles’s-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\n[1203] _Reliquiae Baxterianae._ London, 1696, I. 448.

XIV. p. 131:--“Diseases which seem to be nearest\r\nlike its (plague’s) nature; which chiefly are fevers, called pestilent and\r\nmalignant; for ’tis commonly noted that fevers sometimes reign popularly,\r\nwhich for the vehemency of symptoms, the great slaughter of the sick, and\r\nthe great force of contagion, scarce give place to the pestilence; which,\r\nhowever, because they imitate the type of putrid fevers, and do not so\r\ncertainly kill the sick as the plague, or so certainly infect others, they\r\ndeserve the name, not of the plague, but by a more minute appellation of a\r\npestilential fever.”\r\n\r\n[1205] In a letter from London, 9 May, 1637 (Gawdy MSS. at Norwich, _Hist.\r\nMSS. Commis._ X. pt. 2. p. 163) it is said: “There is a strange opinion\r\nhere amongst the poorer sort of people, who hold it a matter of conscience\r\nto visit their neighbours in any sickness, yea though they know it to be\r\nthe infection.”\r\n\r\n[1206] Evans, in preface to 1721 edition of Vincent’s book.\r\n\r\n[1207] _Cal.

He there showed Ellwood the manuscript of _Paradise\r\nLost_, which was published in 1667. The poem contains no reference to the\r\nplague, unless, indeed, the flight to the country had given point to the\r\nlines in the 9th book:\r\n\r\n  “As one who long in populous city pent,\r\n   Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,\r\n   Forth issuing on a summer’s morn, to breathe\r\n   Among the pleasant villages and farms,”--\r\n\r\nAn opportunity arises in the 12th book, where the Plagues of Egypt come\r\ninto the prophetic vision of events after the Fall; but the movement is\r\ntoo rapid to allow of delay, and we have no more than--\r\n\r\n  “Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,\r\n   And all his people.”\r\n\r\nGibbon thought that the comet of 1664 (which was generally remarked upon\r\nas a portent of the plague that followed) might have suggested the lines,\r\nII. 708-11\r\n\r\n                  “and like a comet burn’d,\r\n  That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\r\n  In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\r\n  Shakes pestilence and war.”\r\n\r\nGibbon seems to make a slip in taking these as “the famous lines which\r\nstartled the licenser;” those are usually taken to have been I. 598-9, the\r\nfigure of the sun’s eclipse, which\r\n\r\n                “with fear of change\r\n  Perplexes monarchs.”\r\n\r\n[1212] _Brit.

Some hundreds of them were collected and\r\nre-interred. (_Notes and Queries_, 3rd Ser. IV. 85.) The ground was part\r\nof the old enclosure of Bethlem Hospital (St Mary’s Spital outside\r\nBishopsgate), and was acquired for a cemetery, to the extent of an acre,\r\nby Sir Thomas Roe, in 1569. Probably there were plague-pits dug in it\r\nduring more than one of the great epidemics, from 1593 to 1665.\r\n\r\n[1214] _Cal.

Sed haec\r\npostea clarius patuerunt.” On this Gibbon remarks: “Philosophy must\r\ndisdain the observation of Procopius, that the lives of such men were\r\nguarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or Providence;” and most men\r\nwill agree with Gibbon. But, if we could be sure of the fact of immunity\r\n(and Boghurst’s testimony is a little weakened by his deference to\r\nDiemerbroek, who knew the classical traditions of plague), it might be\r\npossible to explain it on merely pathological grounds.\r\n\r\n[1218] John Tillison to Dr Sancroft, September 14, 1665.

Rhodes, S. T. Hall,\r\nWilliam and Mary Howitt, S. Roberts, and J. Holland. The story is also in\r\nthe _Book of Golden Deeds_.\r\n\r\n[1226] Bacon (_Sylva Sylvarum_, Cent. X. § 912. Spedding II. 643) says:\r\n“The plague is many times taken without a manifest sense, as hath been\r\nsaid. And they report that, where it is found, it hath a scent of the\r\nsmell of a mellow apple; and (as some say) of May-flowers; and it is also\r\nreceived that smells of flowers that are mellow and luscious are ill for\r\nthe plague: as white lilies, cowslips and hyacinths.”\r\n\r\n[1227] Sir Thomas Elyot, in _The Castle of Health_ (1541), says that\r\n“infected stuff lying in a coffer fast shut for two years, then opened,\r\nhas infected those that stood nigh it, who soon after died.” (Cited by\r\nBrasbridge, _Poor Man’s Jewel_, 1578, Chapter VIII.)\r\n\r\n[1228] Milner’s _Hist. of Winchester_.\r\n\r\n[1229] _The City Remembrancer_, Lond. 1769, vol.

A. Herbert, of\r\nthe Manuscript Department, pointed them out to me.
