This cause\r\nof disease is often entirely overlooked even by medical men, either\r\nfrom false notions of delicacy, or because their attention has not\r\nbeen drawn by fearful experience to cases which are ascribable merely\r\nto onanism. The patient is unconscious of his danger, and perseveres\r\nin his vicious habit--the physician treats him symptomatically, and\r\ndeath soon closes the scene. “Many a young man,” remarked a physician,\r\nwho had seen much of disease from this cause, “many a one has come to\r\nme, totally unconscious that his criminal act was sapping to the very\r\nfoundation his health and strength.”\r\n\r\nTo call the attention of medical men to this source of disease, and to\r\npoint out to such persons not of the profession as may meet with this\r\nbook, and who indulge in this habit, the fatal precipice to which they\r\nwend their way, has been the object of publishing it here. How very\r\nmany cases of consumption, that disease which annually destroys its\r\nthousands, could, if the truth were known, be referred to this cause!\r\nHow many minds have been ruined by self-indulgence!\r\n\r\nIf any apology were needed for this publication, it may be found in the\r\nlast annual report of the State Lunatic Asylum of Massachusetts, which\r\nstates that of the number of insane received at that institution during\r\nthe last year, no less than THIRTY-TWO lost their senses from this\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n\r\n  EFFECTS OF VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER 1.

MODE OF REPAIRING THE INJURY ARISING\r\n  FROM VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nONANISM\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nOTHER ABUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF EXCESS IN VENERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan the power possessed by man of indulging in the act of venery be\r\nabused? or, in other words, can any injury arise to the health or\r\nconstitution, by indulgence in this act. It is sufficient to observe,\r\nthat the affirmative has never been doubted by any author, that no\r\nmedical man has ever been found at any time, or in any country,\r\nso deficient in intelligence as to doubt that venereal enjoyments\r\nwere attended by venereal excess, and no one has ever disputed that\r\nmasturbation or coition may be injurious.\r\n\r\nThe act of venery, then, may be followed by bad effects. But is it\r\nso, and to what extent? This question is the only one which has been\r\ndebated, the only one to be debated. Let then those, who think that\r\nvenereal indulgences are followed only by the remembrance of them,\r\nknow, that deceived by their desires, and perhaps by their necessities,\r\nthey are rushing blindly toward a fatal precipice, which is to be sure\r\nat a greater or less distance from them, but which however exists, and\r\nto which those who do not take warning will arrive more quickly.\r\n\r\nIt is generally thought that venereal excesses, particularly those of\r\nmasturbation, contribute in a considerable proportion to the ills of\r\nsuffering humanity. Some even consider this cause of disease, as one\r\nof the most fatal and active. “In my opinion,” says Réveillé-Parise,\r\n“neither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have\r\nproduced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of\r\nonanism: it is the destroying element of civilized societies, which\r\nis constantly in action, and gradually undermines the health of a\r\nnation.” (_Revue Medicale, April_, 1828, p. 93.) No one has disputed\r\nthe dangers of this kind of excess. Many authors, however, have\r\nthought, that writers had exaggerated on this subject. Thus Montègre\r\nsays that “the bad consequences (although they do exist) attending\r\npremature indulgences have _sometimes_ been exaggerated.” (_Dict. des\r\nsc. med._ vol. vi. p. 100.) Georget’s opinion is similar. According to\r\nhim, (_Physiologie du système nerveux_ vol. i.) most authors and Tissot\r\namong others have much exaggerated the effects of masturbation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, with how much reserve these authors speak. The injury\r\narising from this habit, say they, is very great, but it has been\r\noverrated. Let us now examine upon what grounds they and others have\r\nbeen led to consider these fears as too great: we shall see by what\r\nreasoning they have been governed, and if they are correct.\r\n\r\nMontègre was struck by the instances of individuals who were addicted\r\nto onanism from early childhood, and who, however, in the prime of\r\nvigour and health, had attained an age to which men do not generally\r\narrive, or to whom advanced age comes loaded with troubles. But do\r\nwe not see old soldiers who have always escaped bullets? Now what do\r\nthese facts prove except that such individuals exist? It has also\r\nbeen stated, that influenced with what they have read in books, which\r\ncontain the most formidable cases, as those only are printed, many\r\nphysicians have attributed too much importance to the diseases caused\r\nby onanism. But admitting this, may we not conclude also, that many\r\nsevere affections which it produces are not referred to it? That in\r\nattending cases of dorsal consumption, epilepsy, paralysis, loss of\r\nsight, &c., less dangerous diseases are overlooked, and that their\r\norigin is not suspected? How often, for instance, are we ignorant of\r\nthe true cause of these affections whose characters are constantly\r\nchanging, which are seen every day, which at first produce uneasiness,\r\nbut with which one soon becomes familiar; which are not the symptoms\r\nof a disease having its name and place among other diseases, so much\r\nas the indication of constitutional affections, which appear from a\r\nvariety of influences, and are referred to each one of them. And yet\r\nthis kind of affection, as we shall state hereafter, is that presented\r\nmost frequently by individuals addicted but for a short time to\r\nonanism, who indulge in it but seldom, or whose constitution resists\r\nthis kind of excess.\r\n\r\nAppeal has been made also to direct observation; the number of those\r\nwho have fallen victims to onanism has been cited. It has been said,\r\ncall to mind every thing which has occurred to you in the course of a\r\nlong practice, you will doubtless find deplorable and even numerous\r\ninstances of the diseases attending onanism; but does this number\r\napproximate that of the individuals who abandon themselves to this\r\nvice? There are few persons who are not addicted to masturbation; very\r\nwell, are there many whose constitutions are impaired and whose health\r\nis destroyed? It is admitted that premature and too frequent and too\r\noften repeated indulgences may injure and sometimes have caused great\r\ndetriment, yet those who live through them are very numerous, and the\r\ndistance between the use and abuse of the act of venery, is greater\r\nthan is generally admitted.\r\n\r\nThis manner of counting the dead and wounded has something specious\r\nin it, but it is defective in this respect, that it takes no account\r\nof what has escaped observation, and cannot be estimated. Every\r\npractitioner has undoubtedly seen more cases of masturbation than\r\nhe has seen victims to this habit. But how many circumstances have\r\nprevented him from seeing all the diseases which are caused by this\r\nhabit, or have prevented him from referring these diseases to their\r\ntrue cause? We have already mentioned the influence which his previous\r\nreading and occupation have on this subject; to this cause of errour,\r\nwe may add others. How numerous are the affections which are borne\r\nin silence and which never come under the notice of a physician. How\r\nnumerous too the practitioners who avoid the trouble of referring to\r\nthe immediate or remote causes of the diseases which are observed by\r\nthem, and who confine themselves simply to their treatment, without\r\ntracing them to their source. How often too are diseases resulting\r\nfrom onanism attributed to causes with which they have no connexion,\r\nto causes which were indicated by persons who knew no better, or even\r\nby the patient who believed himself to be interested in giving wrong\r\nstatements. How frequently also does the practitioner exclude himself\r\nfrom obtaining information, by abstaining from making suggestions\r\nto the parents, which all hear with displeasure, and repel with\r\nindignation. How often, also, does he refrain from asking necessary\r\nquestions, for fear of wounding the modesty of the young patient, of\r\nteaching him a thing of which perhaps he is ignorant, or at least of\r\nexciting in him a dangerous curiosity! Finally how frequently are his\r\ndoubts removed by the art with which those who indulge in onanism, even\r\nwhen young, know how to conceal a habit at which they blush in secret.\r\nNow is it reasonable to expect, that the physician when surrounded\r\nby so many causes of errour, should go into statistical details and\r\nestimate from them the sum total of the ills produced by onanism and\r\nother excesses of a similar character? This method would undoubtedly\r\nlead to taking a part for the whole and consequently to forming too\r\nnarrow an opinion of the evil. Many authors having followed this\r\ncourse, and having considered the evils which are unobserved by them\r\nas only imaginary, have not denied the dangers and inconveniences of\r\nvenereal excesses, but have supposed that they exist less frequently\r\nthan is really the case.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to call in question the utility of observations, or\r\nto pretend that they must be neglected. I only wish to say that in\r\nattaching to them too much consequence we are led to false conclusions\r\nwhich may inspire a dangerous security. The physician who commits this\r\nfault, reasons as does the onanist, who being unable to distinguish,\r\neither in his comrades or in himself, the effects of his pernicious\r\nhabit, concludes that it is an innocent practice and that it may be\r\nindulged in unreservedly. The principal utility of observing the\r\ndiseases caused by masturbation is to determine _what are the maladies\r\nproduced by onanism and what is the relative frequency of each of\r\nthem_. We can also certainly form an opinion, from that which is\r\nshown by observation, in regard to that which escapes us. But it is\r\nonly by induction, that the extent of the evils caused by venereal\r\nabuses can be estimated. The bad effects produced by these abuses,\r\ncan be estimated only by considering what they may produce. It is\r\nonly after studying the genital system in its relations with other\r\norgans, and considering the influence it exercises upon them, that we\r\ncan pronounce in regard to the maladies and infirmities and dangers\r\nof all kinds which attend the abuse of the genital system. We proceed\r\nto this subject first. We shall then state what is known from direct\r\nobservation in regard to the different affections which result from\r\nvenereal excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOF THE DANGERS WHICH MAY FOLLOW VENEREAL EXCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo abuse oneself by onanism, by coition, is to abuse the organs which\r\nserve for the execution of these acts. The genital organs in the\r\nfemale are, the vulva, clitoris, vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes and\r\novaries. Those in the male are the penis, the seminal passages and\r\nthe testicles. These organs are then placed in such a state that they\r\nbecome a source of disorder and of disease to the rest of the body.\r\nNow, what is their power in this respect? Can they do much injury?\r\nThis is the question now to be examined.\r\n\r\nThe injury which the genital organs can do to the rest of the body\r\nwhen they are abused, is the natural consequence of the influence\r\nexercised when they are not abused! This injury is in a direct ratio\r\nwith this influence; it is by this then that it must be measured. In\r\nfact, it is clear that if the different organs have in the ordinary\r\nstate different degrees of power, they must, when they do injury,\r\nexercise it in different degrees. Let us then attempt to estimate the\r\ninfluence possessed by the genital organs. If it be demonstrated that\r\nwhen these organs are in a state of rest, of excitement, or in use,\r\ntheir influence on the other functions is considerable, some opinion\r\nmay be formed as to what may be their influence when abused. It must\r\nbe admitted that organs, which have a powerful effect on all parts of\r\nthe body, which regulate all the others, which cannot feel, act, and\r\nperform their functions without the others taking part in what takes\r\nplace in them, it must be admitted I say, that when such organs are\r\nmade instruments of disorder, the bad consequences which follow may be\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nThe genital organs may be observed in three states; the first state is\r\nthat of _rest_. They then merely live, present no special sensation and\r\ndo not proceed to the act of venery. In the second state they become\r\nthe seat, the focus of more or less vivid sensations, and which have\r\nfor a special character to invite and to constrain with more or less\r\npower to the act of venery. In animals, this state is called _rutting_:\r\nin our species, it has no special name, except when existing to a very\r\ngreat degree, and then it constitutes a disease, termed _Satyriasis_\r\nor _nymphomania_: I shall call it the state of _excitement_. The third\r\nis that of _action_: it is the state in which the genital organs are,\r\nwhen they perform their special functions, when they accomplish the\r\nact of venery. They then do not simply live as in the first state, or\r\nfeel as in the second; but they act, and afterward return to one of\r\nthe preceding states, and particularly to the first: they rest. These\r\nare the three aspects under which we shall examine these organs. To\r\nrender our remarks more intelligible, we will give a few definitions.\r\nThe power of bringing the genital organs into a state of action is\r\nthe _venereal_ power: this when put in action is the _act of venery_.\r\nIf this act results from the concurrence of the two sexes, it is\r\n_coition_. If it be caused by solitary manipulation, it then receives\r\ndivers names; the terms most used are _masturbation_, or _onanism_. The\r\nact of venery, whether it does or does not result from the concurrence\r\nof the two sexes may or may not be injurious. When it is injurious\r\nin any degree there is then _venereal excess, abuse of the genital\r\norgans_. This sense is the only one attached in this book, to this mode\r\nof expression: for if in a moral and religious point of view the simple\r\nfact of coition in some cases and of onanism in every case be a vice,\r\nan excess, an abuse, the physician should apply these terms only to\r\ncases where the health is injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. INFLUENCE OF THE GENITAL ORGANS CONSIDERED IN A STATE OF REST.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that when these organs are at rest, when they are\r\nneither used nor abused, when the venereal sense is as it were asleep\r\nin them, and they seem occupied only with their own development, and\r\nnutrition, it might seem I say that these organs take little or no\r\npart in what is going on around them: but this is a mistake. We shall\r\nsee that this dull life which then occupies them is sufficient to make\r\nthem a powerful focus of action; that all the other organs owe to them\r\na part of their mode of existence their form and substance. By this\r\nwe can judge of what the genital system is capable, when excited, and\r\nwhen by the hand or otherwise it is brought to the highest degree of\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nConsider him who was born an eunuch, the man who has never had genital\r\norgans, whose body, mind, and heart are developed without their\r\ninfluence: compare him with other men and see in what he is deficient:\r\nfor his physical moral and intellectual relations will of course be\r\ndeficient in all that depends on the genital organs. This study will\r\nreveal to you their power, and will point out to you the difference\r\nbetween a man in whose development they have assisted, and one in whose\r\ndevelopment, the genital organs have taken no part.\r\n\r\nEunuchs are very seldom tall: they are frequently short and sometimes\r\nvery short. A woman fifty-two years old, who had no uterus, and whose\r\ngenitals were presented to the academy of medicine by M. Renaulden,\r\nwas only three and a half feet high. The limbs of eunuchs when they\r\nare not percolated with white fluids, are generally thin and badly\r\ndeveloped. Their bones have neither their usual size nor form, as has\r\nbeen remarked by many observers, particularly by M. Mojon of Geneva.\r\n(_Alibert_, _Nouv. El. de therapeutique_, 3d edition, vol. ii., p.\r\n115.) This defect in growth is much more remarkable in the larynx.\r\nThis organ which generally acquires two-thirds of its size at puberty,\r\nremains as in infancy, and the voice preserves that shrillness which\r\nit has in young people, but becomes a little stronger because the\r\nchest enlarges. The different tissues are not only less developed,\r\nbut some are not developed at all. Thus in eunuchs the beard and the\r\nhairs on the pubis are deficient; their skin remains as free from\r\nhairs as in early youth. The genital organs then have a powerful\r\neffect on nutrition, because when they are deficient, the growth is\r\ndefective or ceases entirely. This influence is manifested also by the\r\ncharacters presented by the different tissues after the action of the\r\ngenital parts ceases. To understand these characters, we have only\r\nto compare the flesh of animals who have been castrated with that of\r\nthose who are perfect; for example the flesh of the ox with that of\r\nthe bull, that of the capon with that of the rooster &c. In the eunuch\r\nthese characters are no less marked. His organization is in a measure\r\nstationary. When an adult, he preserves in great part the physical\r\nattributes of youth, and then when these are lost, those of old age,\r\nand not those of manhood, present themselves. It is the genital organs\r\nthen which in a perfect man, give colour to the skin, give to the flesh\r\nmore consistence and firmness and which gradually take up from the\r\ncellular tissue those white fluids, which prevent us from seeing the\r\nprominences of the bones and muscles. The organization of the eunuch\r\nis then unfinished, imperfect. The organs which should have appeared\r\nat the period of puberty are not seen: others acquire only a part of\r\ntheir growth: all retain a part of those characters which they ought\r\nproperly speaking to lose and do not obtain those which belong to them.\r\nThese facts are highly important. The study of them demonstrates the\r\nextent of the derangement caused by venereal excesses: for the organs\r\nabused by the onanist and libertine, are those which take so active and\r\nspecial a part in the internal economy of all our tissues: which stamp\r\nthem with the seal of virility, of which the eunuch always remains\r\ndestitute.\r\n\r\nConsider the eunuch now in his life of relation: look in him for the\r\nthought, activity, and sensibility of the man. In these respects\r\nalso how much he is deficient; he is inactive, indifferent, and\r\ndestitute of energy. The lymphatic temperament is marked in him by\r\nhis insensibility, his apathy, no less than by the delicacy of his\r\nflesh, and the whiteness of his skin. He has preserved from infancy\r\nthe disposition given by feebleness, to be excited by the least\r\ncause: hence he is timid and pusillanimous and cowardly. Devoid of\r\nany internal feeling which renders the soul gay, he is morose and\r\nwearisome. He is destitute of those feelings which attach man to man\r\nand render one capable of attachment, love, and devotion. He lives,\r\nhe vegetates only for himself: he is a perfect egotist: if he has any\r\nsentiments they are those of envy or hatred: in fact they are repulsive\r\nsentiments: but most frequently he has none or they are very slight.\r\nThe crimes of the eunuch come in fact less from the sentiments he has,\r\nthan from those he has not. His mind, like his body and heart, remains\r\na perfect waste. His intelligence is but moderate and he is never\r\nknown to conceive or execute great ideas. This picture is not drawn\r\nfrom the imagination; it is the result of long continued observations\r\nat all periods, in all places, and upon all kinds of eunuchs. One of\r\nthem observed by M. Bedor embodied in himself the principal features of\r\nthis picture. He was an eunuch from birth who had become a conscript.\r\nHis appearance was humble and languishing; his eyes were downcast and\r\naverted; he was very timid and cowardly, was afraid of dead bodies,\r\nand of darkness. He admitted that he had never been attached even to\r\nany member of his family: but he was also incapable of dislike. He\r\nwas not pleased with musick, and had no idea of singing: finally he\r\nwas insensible to all enjoyment. He did not however complain of his\r\nsituation. His intelligence was very slight, his conversation was\r\nobscure and incorrect, and he was so incapable of being instructed that\r\nalthough he had lived in the barracks a year he had none of the moral\r\nhabits of the soldier. (_Journal de med. chir. et phar._ vol. xxv. p.\r\n75.)\r\n\r\nSuch is the eunuch. The operator in mutilating him mutilated his heart,\r\nhis senses, his mind. The development of the moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties then like that of the body is connected with the existence\r\nof the genital organs. Deprive a child of a limb of his four limbs,\r\nthat is of the half at least of his frame, and he will continue to be\r\ndeveloped, the same as if no part had been taken from him. But take\r\naway the testicles, and all his tissues, all his faculties will bear\r\nindelible marks of this mutilation. These organs alone then have much\r\nmore power than the four extremities. It is with these, with this\r\npower, that the onanist trifles from childhood, without hesitation\r\nand without moderation. Is it necessary now to follow this train of\r\nreasoning to show that his course of conduct is dangerous? It is\r\nalso to the influence exercised by the genital organs on other parts\r\nthat the sexes owe their peculiar differences. Their organization,\r\ninfluenced by a different genital apparatus, presents a different\r\nmode of existence, action and sensation. Thus the sexual characters\r\nare slightly marked at birth, become distinct as the genital organs\r\ndevelope themselves, suddenly enlarge at the period of puberty, exist\r\nin the greatest degree when these parts have come to their perfect\r\nstate, and lose their energy in old age. The destruction of the\r\ntesticles in the male and of the ovaries in the female prevents the\r\nregular development, or even alters the special distinctions of sex.\r\nWe have already seen that this destruction renders man effeminate:\r\nwe will add that it renders the female more masculine, and gives her\r\ncharacters, which in the natural order of things belong exclusively to\r\nthe male. This conclusion is drawn from facts which seem authentic,\r\nand it is strengthened too by the fact that when the activity of the\r\ngenitals is destroyed by age, the voice becomes rough, resembling\r\nthat of the male, the upper lip and chin are covered with hairs, the\r\nmoral character acquires more firmness, the taste and habits are much\r\nmodified and approximate those of the male. A similar thing occurs in\r\nanimals according to Dumeril. (_Dict. des sc. med., art. continence_,\r\np. 118.)\r\n\r\nIt is not only by comparing the sexes that we see that different\r\ngenital organs have a different action, but it follows also from\r\nobserving those doubtful beings termed _hermaphrodites_. In these\r\nindividuals the genital organs disturbed in their regular development,\r\npresent doubtful appearances and belong at the same time to the two\r\nsexes. In these individuals the organization being influenced in\r\nanother manner is developed differently. Faithful to these organs which\r\ngenerally impress in the body the seal of sex, the general state of the\r\nbody becomes equivocal like them and presents a mixture in different\r\nproportions of the male and female attributes. Thus in a girl whose\r\nhistory is stated by Beclard, and who among other imperfections of the\r\nexternal genital organs which rendered her sex doubtful, presented a\r\ncomplete closure of the vulva, and a clitoris so much developed that\r\nit resembled a penis, the larynx and voice were like those of a youth:\r\nthe upper lip, the chin and cheeks presented a white beard, long and\r\ncoarse hairs covered the lower extremities and surrounded the anus;\r\nfinally the proportions of the trunk and limbs and the formation of\r\nthe pelvis resembled those of man. (_Bull. de la Faculté de med._ vol.\r\niv. p. 273.) It would be easy to refer to similar facts which have\r\nbeen frequently recorded. The general state of the economy, then, is\r\nsomewhat connected with that of the genital parts, varies like them and\r\ntakes part in the changes which they undergo. Hence it is astonishing\r\nto see libertines and onanists render themselves effeminate, and\r\ndemoralize their constitution by using these parts in such a manner as\r\nto fatigue and change them: and to observe women robbing themselves in\r\nthe same manner of their beauty, the delicacy of their form and the\r\ncharm of their voice.\r\n\r\nWhen man has attained his perfect development, the bonds which unite\r\nthe genital organs to the rest of the body become less apparent and\r\nprobably less intimate than before: they however are not destroyed.\r\nCastration certainly does not deprive the adult of all the characters,\r\nof all the faculties which had been developed by puberty: but it\r\nmodifies them very much. The beard has been known to come out after the\r\nloss of the testes as if its existence were connected with theirs, as\r\nan effect is with its cause. The intellectual faculties particularly\r\nlose much of their energy, when the genital organs are removed. Those\r\npersons who have been mutilated not unfrequently become melancholy and\r\nfinally commit suicide. (_Orfila, Leçons de medicine legale_, 1823, p.\r\n126.) A remarkable case of enervation was observed by Richerand, in\r\nsome soldiers whose testes had been shot away in action. Among other\r\ncases, he mentions a soldier who had previously been celebrated for\r\nhis activity and valor, and who, after his mutilation took an aversion\r\nto any violent exercise, and to gain his livelihood, applied himself\r\nto such labours as are carried on by females, particularly to sewing\r\ngloves. (_Richerand, nosographie chirurgicale_, 2nd edition, vol.\r\niv. p. 292.) Compare these facts with what takes place when age, that\r\ngreat operator, extinguishes the principle of virility. When one is\r\nold, is he as affectionate, as sensible, as devoted, as intelligent, as\r\nhe was in youth? do not the general characters of an eunuch gradually\r\ncome upon him? The genital organs then, even when in repose, regulate\r\nin more than one respect and at every period of life, the rest of the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\nBut it is particularly before and during puberty that these organs\r\ndeserve the most serious attention, for then they possess the most\r\npower. This power commences with them, and like them increases every\r\nday. Thus the tastes, the characters, the inclinations, and generally\r\nall which distinguishes the sexes in a moral and physical point of\r\nview, are marked from infancy. That poverty of body of heart and\r\nof spirit which characterizes eunuchism, is seen in young eunuchs,\r\nin those for instance who are born destitute of genital organs.\r\nThe soldier whose case is stated by Bedor, always presented that\r\nindifference and languor common to eunuchs; he always avoided all\r\ntrials of skill at wrestling, running, leaping and finally all youthful\r\nexercises, and as we have already remarked, never exhibited attachment\r\nto any one, even to his parents. The influence of the sexual organs\r\nthen commences with life. But it does not attain all its intensity\r\nuntil puberty.\r\n\r\nAt this period, which in our climate commences from the twelfth to the\r\nsixteenth year, a little sooner in females than in males, the genital\r\norgans have the most vitality. Until that time they are developed\r\nslowly and almost imperceptibly; they suddenly increase with great\r\nactivity, and their growth is not arrested till they have arrived at\r\nperfection. This is not the place to enter into details as to the\r\nlabour which then takes place in them: we will merely remark that\r\nthe change is often so intense as to present all the characters of\r\ninflammation. It is then admissible that in such a state these organs\r\nshould exercise on the economy a much more powerful action than\r\nbefore, when their development was imperceptible, and also than they\r\ndo afterward, when they have only to preserve themselves. This in fact\r\nis proved by observation. At no period of life, does the body grow as\r\nrapidly as during puberty. The researches of Quetelet and Villermé on\r\nthe weight and height of men at different ages, (_Annales &c._ p. 26)\r\nleave no doubt on this subject. Thus the annual increase in the weight\r\nof the body which until the period of puberty was only from three to\r\nthree and a half pounds, suddenly rises to five and six pounds when\r\nthis period commences, and gets to be twelve pounds when it is at the\r\nsummum of intensity. And it is worthy of remark that in females who\r\narrive at the age of puberty about two years earlier than males, this\r\nincrease of growth also commences two years sooner. A similar fact\r\nis observed in those monsters who present in early infancy traces\r\nof virility: in them the mass of the body is in a direct ratio with\r\nthe development of the genital system; hence their height and weight\r\nare enormous. This is proved by a great number of facts related by\r\nauthors and particularly by Moreau, Fages, J. G. Smith, Gedike, Meckel,\r\nDupuytren, &c. Let us now compare these facts with those pointed out\r\nwhen speaking of eunuchism, and it will be shown that the power of the\r\ngenital organs in its nutrition follows in its variations those which\r\nthey experience: that the general growth conforms to theirs, that if\r\none advances the other does, and if one be imperfect, the other is\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nThis increase in the activity of the nutritive powers during puberty,\r\nis not shown simply by the increase of the substance of the body, it\r\nmanifests itself by other symptoms. More heat is generated in the\r\ntissues, as is indicated particularly by the facility with which\r\nindividuals at the age of puberty resist cold, and by the interesting\r\nremark of Quetelet and Smitz, that the summer of all seasons of the\r\nyear is most fatal to them. Ailments of every kind too show in most\r\nsubjects, that the influence of the genital organs on all parts of\r\nthe body may be so great as even to derange the functions: of this\r\ncharacter are pains, heaviness in the head, vertigos, redness of the\r\nface, numbness in the limbs, dulness and oppression, palpitations\r\nof the heart, bleeding from the nose, painful engorgements of the\r\nlymphatic ganglions, different inflammations, &c. &c. Finally the body\r\nresponds like an echo, to all that takes place in the genital system.\r\nNeed we say that nothing of the kind takes place in eunuchs.\r\n\r\nThe active development of the genital parts exercises an equal\r\ninfluence on the functions of the life of relation, in the faculties\r\nof sensation, action, and thought. These faculties, which are so\r\nfeeble in the eunuch are extremely active during puberty. This is the\r\nage of muscular activity and agility. If those who are growing up,\r\nsometimes are reluctant to take exercise, this feeling of reluctance\r\ndepends on a hyperemia of the nervous centres, which soon disappears.\r\nNumerous different and generally transient sensations, denote the part\r\nwhich the nervous system takes in what passes in the genital system;\r\nand this is proved also by the frequency of convulsive and spasmodic\r\naffections at this period of life. The moral susceptibility is then\r\nstill more exalted than the physical susceptibility. The mind directed\r\nand controlled by the most vivid, most varied, and most transient\r\nimpressions, takes up and lays aside the most opposite opinions, and\r\nadopts the most hazardous enterprises. This disposition has existed\r\nto so great a degree as even to constitute a kind of monomania, so\r\ntransient as to be almost imperceptible, and during which crimes,\r\n(particularly that of arson) were committed. This fact rests on the\r\nauthority of Osiander, Henke, of the faculty of medicine at Leipsick,\r\nof Marc and of many other authors. (_See Marc’s memoir on incendiary\r\nmonomania, Annales d’hyg._ October, 1833.) But the mental state\r\nresulting from the change of puberty is characterized particularly by\r\nthe readiness with which one shares the affections of others, partakes\r\nof their sympathies, and sympathizes with them. This is the moment of\r\ngenerous ideas, or as is remarked by those, whose minds no longer feel\r\nthe action of organs which have become mute, the period of illusions.\r\nHow much experience ought not the mind to gain when passing through\r\nthis moral tempest? Is it astonishing then to find weak minds and cold\r\nhearts among eunuchs? Being deprived of these organs which at the\r\nperiod of puberty give so marked an impulse to the system, they do not\r\nfeel it: the most active of all moral excitants is absent. Judge from\r\nthis of its power, and yet it is this stimulant which is so much abused\r\nby the onanist.\r\n\r\nLet us resume our remarks. We have seen by comparing the eunuch to the\r\nperfect individual, the male to the female, and the hermaphrodites to\r\nthose persons whose genitals are perfect, that the genital organs, from\r\nthe simple fact of their existence, exercise a well-marked influence\r\non the physical intellectual and moral constitution of individuals. We\r\nhave also seen by comparing the period of life when the genital organs\r\nare actively developed, with that when they are simply preserved, that\r\nthe influence which has been spoken of, is exercised with a variable\r\ndegree of intensity, and is in a direct ratio with the vital activity\r\nwhich exists in these organs. We may then state as a positive truth,\r\nthat the genital system modifies extensively the action and sensation\r\nof all our organs, and modifies it in proportion as it is itself\r\nexcited. This fact stated, the question whether venereal excesses can\r\nor cannot do much injury is resolved. We may, _à priori_, affirm,\r\nthat when the genital organs pass from a state of repose to that of\r\nexcitement, and from this to a state of action, their influence on the\r\nother organs is always in an increasing ratio. To prove this requires\r\nno new facts. This action and this progressive increase of power,\r\nresult, inevitably from the comparisons we have made. Life is so\r\nmysterious and on the other hand, coition is so transient, that what\r\ntakes place in the tissues during its continuance is concealed from\r\nview: but we may be certain that something takes place in them, that\r\nsome disturbance there occurs and that the disturbance is greater\r\nduring the act of venery than during the preceding states. This act\r\nthen exerts more influence than it appears to exert, as it affects\r\nall parts of the organization. If when the genital system appears at\r\nrest, it exercises so much influence on the vitality of the other\r\norgans, what must be its power when the venereal sense is excited in\r\nit, and further when this sense is carried by masturbation or coition\r\nto the greatest degree of excitement. How much then must these secret\r\nfunctions be modified, whose exercise is so intimately connected with\r\nthat of the genital organs! Certainly those who say that the possible\r\nconsequences of venereal excesses are exaggerated, have not taken this\r\nview of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. POWER OF THE GENITAL ORGANS CONSIDERED IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen these organs are in a state of _excitement_, they present a\r\ngreater degree of excitement than at any of the phases of the state\r\nof repose, not even excepting that of puberty. We may say that they\r\nhave passed from the chronic to the acute state. They not only\r\nbecome the seat of a vivid and special sense, but they also present\r\na kind of turgescence of erethism, and I will say of very remarkable\r\ninflammation. They swell, become firm and redder, hotter, and moister:\r\ntheir sensibility becomes extreme. Their power ought certainly to\r\nbe increased in proportion to the distance between this state and\r\nthe one of repose. This excitement however is so transient, and the\r\nfunctions on which it reacts are so mysterious, that a great part of\r\nits immediate influence cannot be estimated. For in order to mark the\r\naction of the genital organs on the mode of existence on the action\r\nof the different tissues we must compare individuals to individuals,\r\nthat is a whole life with a whole life, or at least we must compare two\r\nlong portions of the same life. On this point the study of the state of\r\nrepose, of that state which is incomparably the most common, has been\r\nuseful to us, for we have arrived at facts, by considering their remote\r\nconsequences, which at the moment of their production, constantly\r\nescape. The state of excitement however does not manifest itself solely\r\nby the sensations which attend it. Different signs show that the rest\r\nof the economy feels that the power of the genital organs is increased.\r\n\r\nIn fact when this state is well marked, the heat of the other parts\r\nof the body is increased. The eyes are more brilliant: the colour of\r\nthe complexion is more lively, the pulse is quicker, and the patient\r\nexperiences a kind of febrile agitation which in satyriasis and\r\nnymphomania, that is, in the greater degrees of human venery, presents\r\nthe characters of a highly marked fever. The secretions also undergo\r\nimportant modifications, which are but slightly marked in man, but are\r\neasily recognised in a great number of animals, who exhale during the\r\n_period of heat_, a strong and most generally a disagreeable odour. The\r\nfunction of nutrition also suffers from this state: thus if it appears\r\ntoo frequently, or is continued too long, the embonpoint disappears,\r\nthe flesh becomes dry, and the body exhibits that leanness which is\r\nseen so frequently in those who are extremely salacious. But, I repeat,\r\na great part of the influence exercised upon the nutritive functions by\r\nthe genital organs when in a state of excitement would be overlooked,\r\nif only the phenomena mentioned were taken into account. In fact these\r\nphenomena are only those which fall directly under the notice of the\r\nsenses, and we believe that their number and proportions would increase\r\ninfinitely, if the observer could directly inspect the tissues closely.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking fact in the state of excitement is the\r\ndevelopment of a special sense, the _venereal_ sense. This fact\r\ncharacterizes this state and it effaces the others to such an extent\r\nthat it seems to form it alone. We shall not attempt to describe the\r\ngenital sense: a sense cannot be described. We may however ask what is\r\nrequired? Even as hunger impels to eat and thirst to drink, this sense\r\nimpels to the act of venery. It is the bond which brings the two sexes\r\ntoward each other, which unites them and which makes, in the words of\r\nthe disciples of a new belief, a perfect individual of the male and\r\nfemale. This sense may be only feebly excited, and then may have only a\r\nmoderate degree of power. But when it is exalted, the chain with which\r\nit binds the free will is of incalculable power. The male dreams of the\r\nfemale: the latter of the male. One of the opposite sex is continually\r\npresent to the mind and eyes and imagination. Individuals and forms\r\nwhich at other times appear by no means remarkable, now seem perfect\r\nand excite transports of admiration. Riches and honors are no longer\r\nesteemed, and even life itself is considered as not worth possessing.\r\nAll necessities have disappeared before one only. Hunger and thirst\r\nare no longer felt. In fact it is a state of delirium. All the senses\r\nare concentrated in one: it commands them and receives from them, like\r\na blind master, all the illusions which they present to it: and then\r\nfatigued by this violent state and exhausted by its excess, even when\r\nnot satisfied, it is as it were extinguished. Such is the power of the\r\ngenital organs, those organs which are abused by the onanist. Who then\r\ncan question the physical evils with which its abuse may be attended.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. POWER OF THE GENITAL ORGANS CONSIDERED IN A STATE OF ACTION.\r\n\r\nIf the individual either by legitimate modes or otherwise, wishes to\r\nsatisfy his desires, the state of excitement becomes changed to one of\r\naction, and the genital organs then arrive at their greatest degree\r\nof power. All parts of the genital system are interested, and combine\r\ntheir actions: the testes prepare the semen: the excretory ducts convey\r\nit: the prostrate gland and the muciparous follicles secrete their\r\nspecial humours, and the mucous fluids flow to the sexual parts. The\r\nerectile tissue, which forms the whole of the glans, the cavernous\r\nbodies, the clitoris, and most of the external and internal labia, the\r\nvagina &c., solicits to itself and retains the blood, becomes swelled\r\nby as much as it can contain, hardens and enlarges to the utmost of\r\nits capacity. At the same time the genital sense passes rapidly through\r\nall the degrees of excitement: and finally arrives at that point beyond\r\nwhich it cannot extend: every muscle, every mature fibre in the genital\r\nsystem is then convulsed: the seminal vesicles, the muscles surrounding\r\nthe urethra and those which are attached to the anus contract with\r\nviolence, and the semen, the loss of which causes so much exhaustion\r\neven when discharged involuntarily, is convulsively expelled.\r\n\r\nThe scene now changes: the genital apparatus, lately so full of life\r\nnow becomes flaccid: the scrotum becomes loose and pendent, and a\r\nsensation of torpor, of fatigue, of chill follows. The convulsive\r\nmotions are succeeded by a kind of paralysis, and all attempts at new\r\nexcitement are vain.\r\n\r\nDuring this tumult and after this crisis, the general state of the\r\npatient conforms in every manner to that of the genital system. Thus\r\nthe face reddens, the neck swells, the veins become filled; the skin\r\nis now burning and now moistened with sweat, the heart beats with\r\nrapidity; in fact there is a state of fever, which almost justifies\r\nus in placing the act of venery among diseases. At the same time the\r\nnervous centres, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the spinal marrow,\r\nexperience a very powerful impression. As the state progresses,\r\nconsciousness is lost, and the subject is as it were in a state of\r\ndelirium. The will is suspended, and the muscles are not controlled by\r\nit, but by the nervous centres which are so much irritated. Thus the\r\ntrunk and limbs are agitated by involuntary motions and chills. This\r\ndisturbance increases until the crisis arrives, when the convulsion\r\naffects the genital system; a fit of epilepsy as it were ensues: the\r\nsight becomes dim, the trunk stiffens and the neck is thrown back: and\r\nfinally this state might be regarded as a violent access of disease if\r\nthe beginning and end of it were not known.\r\n\r\nNow however the individual is changed: his face has lost its color,\r\nhis limbs are stiff, without motion and as it were paralyzed: the head\r\nis painful, the mind is slow and the limbs are incapable of the least\r\neffort. The hearing is dull, the sight is deranged, and the external\r\nsenses impart to the brain only imperfect impressions. The pulsations\r\nof the heart are feeble, the pulse is small, the veins are collapsed\r\nand the eyelids are livid. The soul is left in a state of languor and\r\nsadness and becomes as it were melancholy.\r\n\r\nThis picture although giving the principal points is far from being\r\ncomplete; in order to be perfect it should include that which is not as\r\nwell as that which is seen. If the simple labor which takes place in\r\nthe genital organs at puberty, is sufficient to modify materially the\r\nfunctions of nutrition, functions which when deranged give rise to many\r\ndiseases, what must be in this respect the influence of the venereal\r\nact, and a fortiori of venereal excesses. This influence, like that\r\nexercised by this act on the nervous system cannot be appreciated at\r\nthe moment it is produced, for it is not immediately perceptible. An\r\nidea of this can be gained only in two modes: one consists in measuring\r\nthe long intervals which exist between a state of repose and that of\r\naction: we then say that if the first can modify to such an extent the\r\ntexture of these organs, their powers of sensation and of action, how\r\ngreat must be the power of the second. In this manner we reason in this\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nIn the other mode an opinion may be formed by remarking the physical\r\nalterations and functional disorders which have been the consequence\r\nof them. This kind of proof which we shall soon examine will not fail\r\nus. We shall then see that the diseases affecting the nervous system,\r\nthat system which is powerfully disturbed during coition, are not\r\nthe only ones resulting from venereal excesses. We shall see that\r\nall alterations of tissue, every physical disorder, may be caused by\r\nthem: and thus we shall complete the proof of this fact that the act\r\nof venery not only produces that convulsive state which is so powerful\r\nwhile it continues but that it also exercises on all parts of the body\r\nan action which is extremely powerful and is also the source of many\r\nevils. When we think of the power of the act of venery, and consider\r\nthat it may be indulged in as often as an individual chooses, and that\r\nif the legitimate mode of indulgence, the concurrence of the sexes is\r\ndenied, the individual may abuse himself; when we reflect we say on\r\nall this, we may fearlessly assert that most of the inconveniences and\r\ndiseases afflicting the human species, arise from venereal excesses.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered masturbation and coition abstractedly\r\nand as if there were no circumstances to change the influence they\r\nexercise. But is this always the case? Are there not individuals who\r\nare rendered indisposed by a single act of venery? Are there not others\r\nwho can repeat this act with impunity at near intervals and for a long\r\nperiod of time? Farther is its influence always the same? Are there not\r\ncircumstances which render it more or less injurious and dangerous at\r\ndifferent periods of life? And now what are the circumstances and the\r\ncauses of all the differences we have mentioned? This subject will be\r\nconsidered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RENDER THE ACT OF VENERY MORE OR LESS INJURIOUS TO\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION AND TO THE HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese circumstances are of two kinds: some depend on the act itself:\r\nothers are independent of it and depend most frequently upon the\r\ndisposition in which the economy is at the moment of its occurrence.\r\nLet us study in succession these two orders of circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE ACT OF VENERY WHICH RENDER IT\r\nMORE OR LESS INJURIOUS.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding chapter that the influence of these\r\norgans is much greater the more vivid their excitement is: that,\r\nfor instance, this influence has more intensity during the state of\r\nexcitement than during that of repose: finally that its greatest\r\ndegree is felt in the act of venery. The natural consequence of these\r\nfacts is that the greater the excitement of the genital organs during\r\nthis act, the stronger must be the impression caused by it. We may\r\nthen say that its power of doing injury, other things being equal, is\r\nin direct ratio with the force and duration of the excitement which\r\nattends it. And further this result is proved by observation.\r\n\r\nCompare the two sexes together: the female presents instances of\r\nvenereal excess, much less frequently than the male. Whence is this\r\ndifference? Is it not because the genital sense in females is much\r\nless susceptible of excitement than in males, and therefore the act of\r\nvenery causes them much less fatigue? I know that this fact has been\r\ndisputed: and it is asserted that the female is fully as sensual as the\r\nmale; and that if females show their feelings less, it is because they\r\nare controlled by custom. I know also that the reluctance of females\r\nto submit to the approach of the male is ascribed to a kind of tender\r\ncoquetry which tends to increase the ardor of the former. Finally, the\r\nredness of the genital organs of females during the period of heat, has\r\nbeen mentioned as proving the intensity of their sensations. (_Marc_,\r\n_Dict. des Sc. med._, _art. Celib. etc._) But these arguments cannot be\r\nmaintained in opposition to that which daily experience proves to be\r\ntrue, viz., that as a general fact, females are much less addicted to\r\nthe pleasures of love than males, and experience less fatigue during\r\nsexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe inferiority or perhaps the advantage which females have over males\r\nin this respect, depends on the passiveness which they naturally\r\nexercise in the act of generation: and hence their desires are less\r\nstrong. The state of manners justifies their reserve in this respect,\r\nand points out a physiological fact, or rather they are the consequence\r\nof it. As to the pretended coquetry of animals, I do not believe in it\r\nstrongly; and in regard to that of females I believe that it has caused\r\nmore to err than their desires. If the venereal passion be equally\r\ndeveloped in the two sexes, why is onanism more common in males than in\r\nfemales, notwithstanding certain conditions ought to produce a contrary\r\nstate of things? And farther do not many wives yield themselves to the\r\ncaresses of their husbands, without desire and without enjoyment? and\r\nyet this indifference does not prevent conception, for the sensation\r\nof love is not with them, as with the male, an indispensable condition\r\nof the work of generation. Finally would there be any prostitutes,\r\nif coition caused in females the same exhaustion as in the male?\r\nFemales then are indisputably less sensual than males; and when this\r\nfact is taken in connexion with the circumstance that women are less\r\nfrequently victims of venereal excess, does not this tend to prove,\r\nthat, other things being equal, the act of venery is, as before stated,\r\nless injurious, in proportion, as the sensations attending it are less\r\nvivid? Perhaps this explains why females generally live longer by two\r\nor three years, than males, notwithstanding the pains and dangers of\r\npregnancy, parturition and lactation: and this fact may be deduced\r\naccording to Sir John Sinclair, from the registers of mortality of\r\ndifferent countries, and from the rent tables which have been kept\r\nin Holland for a hundred and twenty-five years. Farther, it is well\r\nascertained that every thing which contributes to give more force and\r\nduration to the sensations attending the act of venery, also increases\r\nthe fatigue and disorder which follow it. Coition taken in its simplest\r\nsense, and considered only as an excretion of semen, undoubtedly\r\ncauses much less injury than if it occurs with other sensations. Thus\r\nintercourse with public women and generally with those who do not\r\nexcite strong sensations is generally attended with less derangement,\r\nas Hunter has remarked, than if accompanied with violent passion. Some\r\nauthors however as Sanctorius and Tissot have advanced a contrary\r\nopinion; but they have evidently confounded the state of the mind with\r\nthat of the body. When the soul is possessed of a violent passion, the\r\nardors of love continue a longer time, are not so soon satisfied:\r\nbut does it follow from this that the body presents more resistance.\r\nCertainly not, but only that the pernicious effects are felt less at\r\nthe time; although at a later period they will be perceived.\r\n\r\nOne reason why masturbation is more pernicious than coition arises\r\nfrom the state of mind during the two acts. The onanist, and here we\r\nallude only to those who have some ideas of sexual intercourse and\r\nlove, having no material object which is the beginning and the end of\r\nits pleasures, the imagination must supply and invent it. This mental\r\nlabor renders the sensations stronger and the body more disposed to\r\nfeel them. Added to these, the onanist is desirous of prolonging his\r\nfeeling, and having under his control certain circumstances which in\r\nsexual intercourse hasten the denouement, he retards it. Thus with\r\nfatal skill he gives to this destructive vice all the power it can\r\npossess, and experiences all the evil which this vice can cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. CIRCUMSTANCES INDEPENDENT OF THE ACT OF VENERY, WHICH RENDER IT\r\nMORE OR LESS INJURIOUS.\r\n\r\nThe economy is not equally affected by venereal excesses in all\r\nindividuals at all periods of life. There are some circumstances\r\nwhich make it necessary for masturbation or coition to be more or\r\nless frequently repeated in order to be injurious. Hence if we wish\r\nto know the real influence of these acts, these circumstances must\r\nbe considered. These are numerous but they are not all known. Two\r\nindividuals indulge in onanism: one becomes ill in a few weeks: but the\r\nother resists the pernicious habit longer. These two individuals were\r\ncertainly in different states, as the event proves. This fact however\r\nwas indicated previously by no circumstance: their age, constitution\r\nand manner of living before this were similar: in fact the reason why\r\nthey were affected so differently cannot be told. The difference here\r\npresented by two individuals may be observed in the same person, when\r\nconsidered at different epochs and periods of life. He will resist the\r\nexcess of masturbation and coition to a greater degree at some times\r\nthan at others, although the circumstances on which these differences\r\ndepend are not known. There are then unknown circumstances which have\r\nan effect on the consequences arising from onanism. These remarks are\r\nhighly important and seem to be well understood; and it is clear that\r\nthere is no possible security for the onanist: in vain does he look\r\nfor encouragement by comparing himself to others, or by remarking of a\r\ncomrade: “if he had been as healthy as I am, his health would still be\r\ngood, he would not have died:” or by saying “why should I fear what I\r\nhave indulged in so long with impunity.” This mode of reasoning is out\r\nof the question when the truth of the preceding remark is admitted, and\r\nit is then impossible for a person to deceive himself; and the reason\r\nthat so many abuse themselves is because they think themselves stronger\r\nthan others.\r\n\r\nBesides these circumstances, there are some which are well known\r\nand which contribute more or less to render the act of venery more\r\ndetrimental. These circumstances consist first, in the general state of\r\nthe functions at different ages and in the peculiar state of some of\r\nthem at different _periods_ of life; second, in a coincidence of action\r\nbetween the act of venery, and other causes of disease; third, in the\r\nalterations which the constitution may have already suffered, and in\r\nthe disposition existing to contract certain diseases; fourth, finally\r\nin the state of the diseases with which the patient is afflicted, when\r\nhe indulges in the act of venery.\r\n\r\n§ 3. INFLUENCE WHICH THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FUNCTIONS HAS AT\r\nDIFFERENT AGES, AND WHICH THE PECULIAR STATE OF SOME OF THEM AT\r\nDIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE MAY HAVE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACT OF\r\nVENERY.\r\n\r\nLife is composed of three very distinct periods. In the first, the\r\nbody is developed and formed: it is a period of progress: while it\r\ncontinues, the organs gain in force and substance: it terminates when\r\nthey have arrived at their greatest degree of perfection: and this\r\ngenerally takes place about the twenty-fifth year. During the second\r\nperiod man uses the organs as they are formed and constituted. The only\r\nprocess which takes place in them is one of reparation, of renewal:\r\nthis is the period of maturity: it generally terminates about the\r\nfiftieth year. The third period is the opposite of the first: it is the\r\nperiod of decline. There is, during this latter period, a progressive\r\ndeterioration of the strength and of the tissues. It terminates with\r\nlife. Thus a state of development, that of maturity, and that of\r\ndecline are the three aspects under which life presents itself. Let\r\nus trace the effect of venereal excesses in these different phases of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n_First period._ No animal, and particularly no one of the vertebrated\r\nanimals can procreate on entering the world. The genital organs\r\ndoubtless exist at that time, but their form is rudimentary, which\r\nproves that they are incapable of doing much. These organs do not\r\nacquire the power of fulfilling their special functions, until a more\r\nadvanced period of life, which period varies in different species of\r\nanimals, but is nearly the same in all individuals of the same species.\r\nUntil this time there is no secretion of prolific semen in the male,\r\nnor creation of ovales in the female: the procreative power does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nMan is no exception to this common rule; his genital organs, although\r\ndistinct, are scarcely developed at the moment of birth. The penis in\r\nmales, the nymphæ and clitoris in females appear it is true to have a\r\ncertain size, but this size does not depend on the development of the\r\ntrue spongy, erectile tissue of these parts. The genital apparatus\r\ncontinues to grow, although slowly during infancy, but it does not\r\nbecome filled for reproduction until after the rapid development seen\r\nat puberty. Hence in man, as in all animals, the power of reproduction\r\ndoes not exist until after some portion of life has elapsed. What is\r\nthis portion? why does not the power come earlier or later? this is of\r\nbut little importance: existence is necessary a certain time before\r\nit appears. But as God has made nothing useless in this world, we may\r\nfearlessly assert that those who before the age for procreation, excite\r\nin themselves the feelings attending this faculty, do an unnatural act\r\nand one which is necessarily pernicious.\r\n\r\nThus _à priori_, and by the application of general laws all premature\r\nindulgences are reproved. This opinion is confirmed by the study of\r\nthe human body in the first third of its existence. This period of\r\nlife is marked by two facts of the highest importance. It is then\r\nthat the organs form, that they become perfect in substance, extent,\r\nand texture. It is then also that they acquire in action and in the\r\npower of receiving impressions the characters which form their special\r\nconstitution, that is, the state which considered at the same time\r\nin all the organs, composes what is called the _temperament_. During\r\nInfancy and in youth, the formation of the substance of the body and\r\nof its constitution, is going on. Let us compare with this process, on\r\nthe regularity of which the health, and well-being of the individual\r\ndepends, let us compare, we say venereal indulgences, or rather\r\nmasturbation, for this alone is then possible; we shall then see why\r\nthe generative faculty was not born with us, and why the precocious\r\nexcitement of the genital sense is attended with so much danger.\r\n\r\nThe first result of this excitement is to hasten the material and\r\nsensitive development of the genital organs. The preternatural size\r\nwhich masturbation gives to the penis in children is so remarkable\r\nthat this alone is often sufficient to reveal this habit. Farther\r\nthis excitement not only awakens the venereal sense long before the\r\nlegitimate period of its appearance, but it acquires so much power\r\nthat the youngest persons brave all connective means to satisfy it.\r\nHere then we have a system of organs forcing their development forward\r\nat the expense of the other organs. This state undoubtedly causes\r\nderangement and if we compare the genital organs with those which have\r\nthe least sensibility, we may form an opinion of the consequences\r\nof it. If we reflect on the symptoms attending dentition which are\r\noften severe; or those depending on too rapid growth of the bones, and\r\nthen measure the great difference between the vitality of the osseous\r\nand genital systems, we can form an idea of the injury caused by the\r\npremature enlargement of the genital apparatus. Although there may be\r\nno real disease, yet the wasting of the body, the enervation which\r\nresults from excessive growth are often sufficient to give to a young\r\nman the appearance of an onanist.\r\n\r\nIf such feelings arise simply from the osseous system, what must we\r\nexpect when onanism, with its train of moral and of sensual feelings,\r\nforces the genital organs to take part in the efforts of growth. The\r\npower which is then impaired is the same which we have seen extend\r\nover all parts of the organization, that, whose action when regular,\r\ncontributes so much to make each tissue perfect, in fact that which\r\nwhen removed gives to man the characters of an eunuch. Now consider\r\nonanism as possessing this power and using to do injury all the\r\nenergy which it possesses to do good; what limits shall be assigned\r\nto its injurious effects? and yet some authors question them. Many\r\ngeneral phenomena of puberty also appear prematurely, when premature\r\nindulgences call them into development. Thus the beard appears on the\r\nchin, the pubis is covered with hairs, the voice assumes a deeper tone,\r\nand the first indications of virility show themselves much earlier than\r\nis proper. These symptoms serve to trace the aberrations which onanism\r\ncauses in the formation of the organs. This vice too does not surely\r\nhasten or retard; it deranges: for the derangement of the functions\r\nis not generally manifested by irregularities in formation, aspect,\r\nand texture, but by material alterations, by diseases. Hence why\r\ninflammations of all kinds, and numerous organic affections result, as\r\nobservation proves, sooner or later from anticipated pleasures: now as\r\nthe susceptibility of the organs varies in individuals, and as in one,\r\nthe heart, in another the lungs, the stomach &c. is most liable to be\r\naffected, we see why the list of diseases caused by onanism, comprises\r\nmost of those which afflict the human body.\r\n\r\nNor is this all; if the excitement of a sense, which affects all the\r\nother organs, and to which they respond, occurs at a time when their\r\nmode of action and of sensation, or their temperament is not formed,\r\nthis latter varies from what it would be, if developed calmly and\r\nuninfluenced by this excited sense. Hence not only the _health_ but\r\nthe _constitution_ suffers from the too precocious use of the genital\r\norgans. He who might have attained the age of manhood, with a robust\r\ntemperament by which his body resists numerous bad influences by which\r\nit is constantly assailed, will after indulging in onanism, be exposed\r\nto all these influences. This vice then compromises both the present\r\nand future health of the body; the present by the diseases with which\r\nit is accompanied, and the future by those for which it prepares.\r\nHence if the young man escapes with life, he is as it were loaded with\r\na tribute of ills which he must pay before long and perhaps always.\r\nThus the indirect influence of onanism in producing human suffering is\r\nenormous. I consider it even as greater in proportion than that of the\r\nmost immediate consequences of this fatal habit. This is confirmed not\r\nonly by daily observation, but it cannot be otherwise. How much then\r\ndo those deceive themselves who seek for the diseases of masturbation\r\nwithout believing in their existence, and who continue to indulge\r\nbecause they do not see its abuses.\r\n\r\nIf premature indulgence cause so much injury it should be one of\r\nthe most interesting duties of humanity to prevent children and\r\nyoung persons from abusing themselves, and although the practice of\r\nonanism cannot be controlled by laws, legislators might however fix\r\nthe age under which marriages could not legally take place. We must\r\nhowever admit that circumstances connected with the social state of\r\ndifferent people, with the power of procuring the means of subsistence\r\nfor a family and the necessity of having vigorous children have\r\ncontributed not a little to fix this age. Thus the laws frequently\r\npresent differences which can only be explained by taking into view\r\nthe necessities under which they were passed. Females however are\r\nallowed to marry much younger than males: this depends on two facts,\r\nfirst because puberty takes place earlier in females than in males,\r\nand secondly because the latter require their organization to be more\r\nadvanced to resist the fatigue of generation.\r\n\r\nThe age at which the venereal power enters into full action, and when\r\nits exercise is attended with the least detriment has been generally\r\ndetermined on two distinct grounds: first, the physical aptitude for\r\nsexual intercourse: second, the general state of the organization.\r\nThe marriageable age has been fixed at an earlier or later period\r\naccording as legislators have assumed one or the other of these bases.\r\nThe first served as foundations for the matrimonial laws of the Romans:\r\nand probably the second served as a guide to Lycurgus, who prohibited\r\nmen from marrying before the age of thirty-seven, and to Plato who\r\nrecommended that every child born of a female younger than twenty years\r\nold or begotten by a man less than thirty years, should be branded with\r\ninfamy. J. J. Rousseau too reasons in the same manner: “until the age\r\nof twenty,” he says, “the body grows and has need of all its substance:\r\ncontinence is natural, and if not observed it is at the expense of the\r\nconstitution.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the physical aptitude for coition comes at the age of puberty,\r\nthis fact proves nothing except that the genital organs can then be\r\nused. It does not follow that the genital power is fully developed\r\nor that the body is in the state most favorable for its use. Who\r\nwould venture to say; that because masturbation is practicable in\r\nearly infancy that it is not more injurious than at a later period of\r\nlife? Hence the cause and degree of the evils attendant on premature\r\nindulgence is to be sought for in the degree of perfection of the\r\norganism as we have already stated. We therefore think ourselves\r\njustified in saying that other things being equal the period of life\r\nwhen the act of venery is attended with the least trouble, is that\r\nwhich begins when the organization is completed, is perfected; and as\r\na reverse of this formula, we may say, that other things being equal,\r\nvenereal enjoyments anterior to this period, are more detrimental, the\r\nless perfect the system is.\r\n\r\nThe _perfect state_ then is the point to which the system must\r\narrive, before the act of venery is permitted, and before marriage\r\nis allowable. There is then no longer any fear of disturbing the\r\nformative process. Look at animals, those at least which are not\r\ndomesticated; they do not indulge in the act of reproduction, until\r\nthey have attained their full vigor, and how often too do severe\r\nbattles take place for a female. The domestic animals live in a manner\r\nwhich hastens the development of the venereal sense; and they often\r\nindulge in procreating at an early period, but suffer for it, and the\r\ngenital faculties soon become extinct. It seems also to be proved by\r\nthe researches of Hofalker of Inspruch and Girou of Buzaringues, that\r\nboth in man and animals the age of the individuals has an influence\r\non the sex and quality of the offspring. But why look to animals for\r\nproofs? Daily observation and the testimony of all authors, put beyond\r\nall doubt the danger of precocious indulgence. There are certainly\r\nnumerous individuals of every age who indulge in venereal excesses;\r\nbut those cases which come under our notice, or whose histories are\r\nrelated by authors, are generally those of young people. Different\r\ncauses I know may contribute to this result; one of the principal is,\r\nthat masturbation is the act of venery most frequently practised before\r\nthe adult age, and that this is generally more pernicious than coition.\r\nWe have already stated one reason for this difference; we may add that\r\nas onanism does not require the concurrence of the sexes, it is more\r\nliable on this account to excess. But do these causes alone explain\r\nwhy the immediate consequences of venereal excesses are not seen with\r\nbut few exceptions except at an early period of life. The enormous\r\ndisproportion arises from the precocity of these excesses, and also\r\nfrom the state of the economy before it is perfect.\r\n\r\nWe have now to determine at what period of life the body arrives at\r\nits perfect state and the distance which separates it from this state\r\nat the different ages which precede it. This period however is varied\r\nby many circumstances, and it is far from being the same in every\r\nindividual, in the same country or in the same climate. We can then\r\npresent only mean results, deduced from those collected in France which\r\nare the most numerous and authentic.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the organization of the human body is\r\ncomposed of two parts: the development of the tissues and that of\r\nthe constitution. The economy then cannot be said to be in a perfect\r\nstate until this double development is finished, and the organs\r\nhave gained all their power and substance. Unfortunately the labor\r\nof the constitution and its progress in activity and in receiving\r\nimpressions, cannot be estimated by positive rules: but it is connected\r\nso intimately with the development of the body, that this can give a\r\nsufficiently exact idea of its progress and state. We may then simply\r\nby a glance at the development of texture, fix with a certain degree\r\nof precision, the value of these words: _premature_ and _precocious\r\nenjoyments_.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place to examine the different organs separately and\r\ntrace their growth, and in the present state of science we cannot give\r\nthis labor the precision necessary to attain our purpose. But there is\r\none fact which can be measured, viz., the weight of the body. Let us\r\nstate then the varieties in weight presented at different periods of\r\nlife, as determined by Quetelet and Villermé.\r\n\r\nThe mean weight of a male child at birth is three kilogrammes and\r\ntwenty decimetres. Each year its weight increases in the following\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\n  At 1 year  he weighs  9 kil. 45 dec.\r\n     2  \"         \"    11      34\r\n     3  \"         \"    12      47\r\n     4  \"         \"    14      23\r\n     5  \"         \"    15      77\r\n     6  \"         \"    17      74\r\n     7  \"         \"    19      10\r\n     8  \"         \"    20      76\r\n     9  \"         \"    22      64\r\n    10  \"         \"    24      52\r\n    11  \"         \"    27      10\r\n    12  \"         \"    29      82\r\n    13  \"         \"    34      38\r\n    14  \"         \"    38      76\r\n    15  \"         \"    43      62\r\n    16  \"         \"    49      67\r\n    17  \"         \"    52      85\r\n    18  \"         \"    57      85\r\n    19  \"         \"    60      06\r\n    25  \"         \"    62      93\r\n    30  \"         \"    63      95\r\n    40  \"         \"    63      67\r\n    50  \"         \"    64      46\r\n    60  \"         \"    61      94\r\n    70  \"         \"    59      52\r\n    80  \"         \"    57      83\r\n    90  \"         \"    57      83\r\n\r\nThis table shows us that man attains the maximum of weight at forty\r\nyears of age. At this age then we may regard the economy as being\r\nperfect. Now when we consider that persons from twelve to eighteen\r\nyears indulge most frequently in masturbation and that this habit may\r\nbe formed at a very young age, we may easily conceive of the ills\r\nwith which it may be attended. This consequence is seen more clearly\r\nand exactly by the following table. The mean weight of man when the\r\norganization is complete being sixty-three kilogrammes sixty-seven\r\ndecimetres, at the time of birth he has yet to gain sixty kilogrammes\r\nforty-seven decimetres.\r\n\r\n  At 1 year  old 54 kils. 22 dec.\r\n     2    \"      52       33\r\n     3    \"      51       20\r\n     4    \"      49       44\r\n     5    \"      47       90\r\n     6    \"      46       43\r\n     7    \"      44       57\r\n     8    \"      42       91\r\n     9    \"      41       02\r\n    10    \"      39       15\r\n    11    \"      36       57\r\n    12    \"      33       85\r\n    13    \"      29       29\r\n    14    \"      24       91\r\n    15    \"      20       05\r\n    16    \"      14       00\r\n    17    \"      10       82\r\n    18    \"       5       82\r\n    20    \"       3       61\r\n    25    \"       0       74\r\n    30    \"       0       02\r\n\r\nHence it will be seen that a man who at the moment of birth only\r\npossesses about .05 of the growth he afterwards attains, will have at\r\nmost only a quarter of his full weight when 5 years old, at which age\r\nmany children begin to indulge in masturbation. When ten years of age,\r\nhe has yet to gain nearly .60 and nearly .40 of his weight when he has\r\narrived at his fourteenth year. When sixteen years old, one fifth of\r\nhis weight is still deficient, and at eighteen years nearly one tenth;\r\nhis growth although nearly completed at the age of twenty-five, is not\r\nentirely attained, since even when thirty years old, the weight of the\r\nbody is capable of a slight increase.\r\n\r\n_Of the effect of venereal excesses when the subject of them has\r\nattained his growth._ The age of maturity is the period when venereal\r\npleasures are attended with the slightest derangements and dangers. At\r\nthis period these pleasures may not only not be injurious, but may even\r\nbe necessary. This last circumstance would be sufficient to distinguish\r\nthis period from those of the growth and decline of the body, when\r\nthese pleasures are never useful. Let it not be thought, however, that,\r\nat the age of maturity, they may be indulged in to excess, or that the\r\npleasures of love are limited only by the power of indulging in them,\r\nthis is a great mistake; abuses are less frequent, but they do occur,\r\nas is seen both by experience and by simple reasoning. Although at\r\nthe age of maturity the body increases but slightly, yet the process\r\nof nutrition is not arrested. It is true that the size and weight of\r\nthe body no longer increase, but its substance is constantly renewed.\r\nThe act of venery may then interfere with and derange as before the\r\nfunction of nutrition. The constitution also may be affected, and\r\nalthough the regular course of its formation may not be deranged, yet\r\nit may be deteriorated and its influence on the action and sensation of\r\nthe different organs is so great, that if this deterioration proceed\r\nto any extent, these organs will suffer. Thus the health may be\r\ninjured and the constitution impaired in adults, by venereal excesses;\r\ntheir influence however is resisted longer. The adult age may even\r\npresent more unfavourable conditions for venereal excess than the\r\nperiod of growth. It may be attended with diseases transmitted from\r\npreceding years. In the adult age, the errours of youth are atoned\r\nfor: wretchedness, debauchery, and excesses of every kind may leave\r\ntheir mark upon the body. Venereal excesses then find the constitution\r\nimpaired, the health deranged, and they increase the evil already\r\nexisting. Those particularly who have indulged in masturbation in\r\ntheir youth, perceive on arriving at the adult age, that if they wish\r\nto taste the pleasures of love, even to a moderate extent, they are\r\naffected with bad feelings which prove that premature indulgences must\r\nbe paid for with interest.\r\n\r\nDifferent circumstances may render the act of venery injurious at the\r\nadult age, but as these do not belong exclusively to this age, we shall\r\nspeak of them hereafter.\r\n\r\n_Of the effect of venereal excesses in the period of decline._ The\r\nfaculty of procreating in mankind has its limits: as this power is not\r\nattained till at a certain period of life, so too it continues only\r\nfor a certain period. The spermatic animalculæ, the microscopic sign\r\nof the power of generating, are seen only during a portion of human\r\nexistence: they do not appear till puberty, and disappear in advanced\r\nlife. This is true also in regard to all animals: the rule is a general\r\none. God has willed that the period of maturity should be the only one\r\ndevoted to love: is it not a fair conclusion that those who transgress\r\nthis law expose themselves to its penalties? As the sense of venery\r\nprecedes, so too it may outlive, the procreative power; it then excites\r\nto indulgence at too late a period of life. Examples of this anomaly\r\nare very common; hence we need not refer for them to the works of the\r\nold writers, we will merely say that a large portion of those committed\r\nfor attempts at rape are old men. Fortunately the venereal sense is\r\nthat which suffers the soonest from excesses; and if sometimes the\r\nvenereal desires are excited, the state of the genital organs prevents\r\ntheir indulgence.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the case is otherwise: excited in different ways\r\nthe genital organs in old men, may for a few moments appear to have\r\nregained a faculty which they considered to be lost; these imprudent\r\npersons soon pay dearly for their indiscretion. Let us reflect a moment\r\non the state in which venereal pleasures find man in his old age.\r\nHis substance, instead of increasing or of continuing sound, wastes\r\naway. We have seen in a former page, that after the fortieth year the\r\nweight of the body begins to diminish; the tissues also vary in every\r\nrespect from the perfect state as seen at the age of maturity. Farther\r\nthe sensibility is diminished, the vital activity is enfeebled, the\r\nfaculties become enervated, in short the economy is impaired. Need\r\nwe now to make any remarks in regard to the most exhausting of human\r\nactions to show its danger? And yet we have only pictured old age as it\r\nprogresses of its own accord, gently and slowly, without being hurried\r\non by any infirmity; but this rarely happens.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the adult age, I have pointed out the affections with\r\nwhich it is attended. But the case is worse in old age. All parts of\r\nthe body have suffered so many attacks, have been so often affected,\r\nthat hardly one of them can be called sound. Hence every cause of\r\ndisease is serious and important, the body being as it were ripe for\r\na diseased affection. What ought then to be the influence of the act\r\nof venery? Will it not quicken into life, the seeds of disease which\r\nare as it were already sown? In fact it often has a violent effect on\r\nthe system, and sudden death follows exertions which ought not to be\r\nmade. How many old men have yielded up their existence in the nuptial\r\nbed, when their term of life might have been continued, if they had not\r\nexhausted their strength in unnatural exertions.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the peculiar state of some functions may render the\r\nact of venery more injurious at some periods of life than at others.\r\nThe functions to which we alluded, were digestion, menstruation,\r\npregnancy, and lactation.\r\n\r\nMasturbation and coition are often practised after taking food.\r\nSometimes the general excitement attending the labor of digestion\r\nextends to the genital organs, and excites to these acts. We cannot\r\nsay that they are then always injurious: as this would be contradicted\r\nby facts; but that they frequently are is supported by the opinions of\r\nall authors, who have written on the subject. “Coition after eating,”\r\nsays Sanctorius, “is injurious,” and he attributes the same effect to\r\nthoughts of venery. His commentator Lorry confirms this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe act of venery during digestion, may injure in two modes. First by\r\nderanging the digestive system, and by exposing it to the affections\r\nwhich are the usual consequences of such a derangement. To this\r\nmust be referred most of the derangements usually presented by the\r\ndigestive organs of onanists, who merely watch their opportunities\r\nfor self-pollution, without regarding whether digestion is or is not\r\nfinished. Happily vomiting then sometimes rids the stomach of food\r\nwhich might be badly digested, and thereby cause more disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe second mode in which the act of venery acts during digestion, is\r\nby causing a general state of excitement, which adds to that caused\r\nby the digestive process. All the organs as the heart, lungs, brain,\r\n&c., are during digestion in a state of hyperemia, of congestion;\r\nthey are crowded with blood, as is indicated by a great number of\r\nsymptoms. It can easily be imagined that venereal excitement under\r\nsuch circumstances, may become the cause of inflammations and organick\r\naffections, or may, at least, contribute to their development;\r\nby increasing also a congestion caused by an abundant repast, it\r\nmay immediately excite severe and fatal symptoms. Instances of\r\nindividuals who have died during the act of coition, after leaving the\r\ndinner-table, are by no means rare. Campet states a case where a man on\r\nquitting the dinner-table, at which he had drank freely, was accosted\r\nby a public woman, went home with her, and died in her arms. A marshal\r\nof France a few years since, met his death in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe act of venery, if indulged in during the period of menstruation,\r\nmay sometimes derange this function.\r\n\r\nThe injuries resulting from coition during pregnancy have never been\r\ndoubted; by some, however, too much importance and by others too\r\nlittle has been attached to this state. Levret attributes most cases\r\nof abortion, which cannot otherwise be accounted for, to this cause.\r\nZimmerman, Gardien, Murat, Dugès, &c., also regard this act as a\r\nfrequent cause of miscarriage. Different conclusions have been drawn\r\nfrom these opinions. Some authors assert, that females have a right to\r\ndeny their husbands during gestation. Montaigne is of this opinion.\r\nSome natives as the Mahometans, repudiate all intercourse with pregnant\r\nfemales. In some African tribes, pregnant women are secluded, and no\r\none is allowed to have intercourse with them. Pallas states that the\r\nCalmuck Tartars condemn the person, whose incontinence has caused\r\nabortion, to pay a fine, the amount of which is directly in proportion\r\nto the age of the fetus.\r\n\r\nThe most general opinion however of physicians on this subject, is\r\nthat coition to a moderate extent during pregnancy, and where there is\r\nno disposition to miscarriage, is not generally detrimental: but that\r\nwhen this act is repeated imprudently, it may cause great excitement in\r\nthe uterus, and be attended with abortion. Continence is particularly\r\nrecommended to nervous females, and must be insisted upon when there\r\nis reason to fear abortion. We must however observe, that venereal\r\nexcesses have often been indulged in during pregnancy with evil\r\nintents, but without producing the desired result.\r\n\r\nLactation has also been considered by some authors as contra indicating\r\nthe pleasures of love. Children it is said have been known to become\r\nconvulsed, when nursing just after their mothers had indulged in sexual\r\nintercourse. Lascivious nurses have generally been regarded as bad.\r\nMany mothers, however, admit the embraces of their husbands, and their\r\noffspring does not suffer. We are far from thinking that the influence\r\nsupposed to be exercised by the act of venery upon the milk of nurses,\r\nis entirely unfounded; hence this act should be used with moderation.\r\n\r\n_Influence which the act of venery may have, when coincident either\r\nwith the action of other causes of disease, or with alterations in the\r\nconstitution and health._ When an individual suddenly changes his mode\r\nof living, and the influences to which he has been exposed, and becomes\r\na subject to new influences, his health most generally suffers to a\r\ncertain extent. This is seen in the young man who comes directly from\r\nthe pure air of the country into the confined atmosphere of the city,\r\nand in those who remove from the temperate to the torrid zone. The\r\naction of powerful causes of disease, of excessive heat, of deleterious\r\nexhalations, often adds to the simple change of habit. Thus all authors\r\nwho have written on the diseases of warm countries, consider the act\r\nof venery, as one of the most active occasional causes of yellow\r\nfever, of malignant fevers, of cholera morbus, and generally of the\r\nsevere diseases contracted by Europeans. A similar disposition may\r\nbe seen in young men, who pass many hours in the infected atmosphere\r\nof hospitals, and particularly in dissecting-rooms, if they indulge\r\nwith females or in onanism: typhus fevers have been caused by it.\r\nThe individual who lives in a filthy neighbourhood, who experiences\r\nprivations, who indulges to excess in wine or spirituous liquors,\r\nwho labors hard either corporeally or mentally, who is deprived of\r\nsleep, who is affected with sadness, &c., bears the act of venery\r\nbadly; it adds to the enervation already felt, and generally robs the\r\nindividuals of health. Venereal pleasures should be abstained from,\r\nduring the prevalence of epidemics: every person is then disposed to\r\nthe prevailing disease, and a single act of coition may produce it.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the act of venery is much more injurious, when the\r\ncauses which we have mentioned, and generally all those which may\r\nimpair the constitution, have affected it to a greater or less degree.\r\nDiseases of long duration, if badly treated, excesses and the causes\r\nmentioned above may bring the system to such a state, that enjoyments\r\neven if seldom indulged in, may produce great suffering and disease.\r\nVenereal excesses may also create predispositions and change them\r\nas well as those which have a different origin into other morbid\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the venereal desires do not generally exist,\r\nexcept the person be in a state of health. The same may be said too\r\nof the generative power, if we may judge from Haller’s remark that\r\nthe spermatic animalculæ disappear during disease. It is ascertained\r\nthat the number of conceptions is in a direct ratio with the degree\r\nof health enjoyed by a people; they increase in a healthy season,\r\nand diminish in an unhealthy season. This fact is established by the\r\nresearches of Villermé in regard to the births and deaths in France,\r\nItaly, England and Belgium, and also in regard to the marshy parts\r\nof France at different periods of the year, (_Ann. d’hyg. publ._,\r\n_January_, 1831.) Thus then the genital sense, like that of hunger,\r\nand probably the power of procreating, like that of digesting, is\r\nmost generally suspended during disease. Is not this one of the many\r\nwarnings of the organization, as to the preservative power?\r\n\r\nIt is true however that individuals indulge in coition and masturbation\r\nalthough even in an advanced state of disease. This is most frequently\r\nseen in onanists. “I have seen,” says Pinel, “a person affected with\r\na dynamic fever who was entirely exhausted, and yet his passion for\r\nonanism was so powerful, that on the sixth day of the disease he\r\nstill attempted to excite his organs, although death was coming upon\r\nhim.” Similar cases have been witnessed by every practitioner, which\r\nwe shall mention in the course of this work. Thus then even a severe\r\ndisease does not entirely prevent the act of venery. Let us now inquire\r\nwhat is the effect when such people indulge. It must be admitted that\r\nthis indulgence is at least useless, except in very rare cases, where\r\ncontinence is the cause of sickness. Strictly speaking, this may be\r\nthe case in certain chronic affections and in some few individuals,\r\nbut it is rare. The power of the act of venery is so great, and the\r\ndiseased organs are generally so sensitive to the impressions made\r\non the economy, that if there are apparently some diseases which\r\nseem unaffected by this act, it is because the modification which\r\nthey experience escapes observation. We may then state as a general\r\nrule that if the act of venery be indulged in by sick people, it is\r\ninjurious and generally to a great degree. How great is the injury when\r\nthe disease is caused by venereal indulgences.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that diseases resist to an unaccountable extent all\r\nremedial agents: suspicion is excited and finally we find that the\r\npatient, an onanist before he was taken sick, has continued to abuse\r\nhimself through his sickness: and again, the symptoms of the disease\r\nunder treatment gradually disappear: but the strength does not return,\r\nnor does the patient become convalescent. Debility increases instead\r\nof diminishing: the patient becomes thinner and the fever continues:\r\nfinally the sick person falls into a consumption and the fatal habit\r\nis at last discovered. In others the disease seems to be terminated,\r\nbut is suddenly re-excited, the patient being too hasty to indulge\r\nin masturbation or coition. This happened to a man fifty years old,\r\nwho was gouty, and much addicted to the pleasures of the table, and\r\nwhose case is related by Hoffman. Having indulged in coition soon\r\nafter he was convalescent from pleurisy, this man had a relapse which\r\nwas much more dangerous than the original illness. The same author\r\nstates a similar case, where the imprudence was followed by death.\r\nScrofula, rickets, gout, and stone are says M. Marc, diseases, which\r\non arriving at a certain point, are aggravated by coition. The same\r\nremark applies to all other maladies. M. Falret mentions a female\r\naffected with melancholy at the hospital Salpetrière, whose mental\r\naffection has several times been re-excited by onanism, after she was\r\nthought to be cured. Cutaneous diseases in particular may give an idea\r\nof the influence exercised by the act of venery on those maladies\r\nwhich are deeply situated. Alibert mentions the history of an herpetic\r\ndisease which was always more intense after the patient had indulged\r\nin onanism: this unfortunate individual was then tormented by a severe\r\nitching.\r\n\r\nThe irregularity and singularity of the symptoms of those sick people\r\nwho indulge in onanism, are particularly remarkable. The nervous system\r\nevidently feels an influence in addition to that of the disease, or is\r\ndisposed to be particularly affected by all those which occur. This\r\nfact, established by Tissot and Georget, should always be remembered\r\nby physicians. We may form an idea of the derangement caused by the\r\nact of venery in the progress and appearance of diseases by the severe\r\nsymptoms which it produces in wounds and particularly those of the\r\nhead. Tetanus, delirium, and other nervous symptoms have often been\r\ncaused by it. Fabricius de Hilden states the case of a young man whose\r\nhand was amputated, and whose physician forbid having any intercourse\r\nwith his wife, who was also informed of the danger. But when all\r\nthe symptoms disappeared, and the cure was progressing rapidly, the\r\npatient feeling desires to which his wife could not respond, procured a\r\nseminal emission without coition; it was immediately followed by fever,\r\ndelirium, convulsions and other symptoms, and in four days the patient\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nDeath also often follows coition in patients affected with diseases\r\nof the heart and large vessels. This was seen in the case of Corroy,\r\na servant at the hospital la Chardité. One evening while intoxicated\r\nhe met a courtezan with whom he proposed spending the night, but in\r\nthe midst of his transports he suddenly died. On examining his body it\r\nwas found that he had an aneurism near the commencement of the arch of\r\nthe aorta. The rupture of this tumor was evidently the cause of his\r\nsudden death. Probably also a similar occurrence happened in the case\r\nmentioned by Felix Plater. The patient having married a second time,\r\nexperienced, while consummating the marriage, such a violent degree\r\nof suffocation that he was forced to suspend his efforts: the same\r\nsymptom re-appeared whenever he again attempted it. Having consulted\r\na charlatan, he was recommended to persevere: he did so, and died.\r\nExamples of sudden death during coition are not rare. Death generally\r\narises from aneurism or apoplexy. Pliny the naturalist mentions two\r\ncases, and Tabourdot in his _Bigarrures_, has preserved the epitaphs of\r\nseveral who have perished in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND DISEASES CAUSED BY VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\nThe genital organs when they are abused are precisely in the same state\r\nas if they were diseased. In this case in fact, they are not in their\r\nnormal state for they are in action when the health demands that they\r\nshould rest. Hence when we consider them either specially or as to\r\ntheir action on the rest of the body, we see that they resemble organs\r\nin a morbid state; they are, as it were affected with an intermittent\r\nmalady, having distinct periods of access, which are repeated more\r\nor less frequently, according to the acts of the onanist. The local\r\ncondition of these organs is at first that which they present during\r\nthe act of venery, but at a later period they may present different\r\nalterations, which continue after the periods of access, in the same\r\nmanner as the tissues are modified, if the cause which renders them\r\ndiseased continues to act on them. The general state of onanists is\r\nalso perfectly analogous to that observed in diseases. In them, the\r\ngenital organs are the seat of different symptoms, and the focus of\r\nnumerous diseases. The symptoms appear first only during the periods of\r\naccess, or for a few hours afterward: then they continue longer and the\r\nintermissions become shorter and afterward are only remissions: finally\r\nthe disease is perfectly continued. This is the usual course of the\r\nsymptoms of this affection which may be called the _genital_ disease.\r\nFrequently however, one of the derangements of the reproductive system,\r\nassumes, on account of its individual peculiarities a more determined\r\ncharacter than the others, and becomes as it were independent of them.\r\nThis disorder is then no longer a symptom but becomes a disease which\r\nis in one phthisis, in another myelitis, epilepsy, amaurosis &c. So too\r\nwith a wound; this which at first caused only fever and other symptoms\r\nintimately connected with it, becomes afterward gastroenteritis,\r\ntetanus, or some other disease which has its regular place in systems\r\nof nosology. _Voluntary pollution_, when it becomes injurious must\r\nthen be considered as an _affection_ having its symptoms, and also as\r\na _cause_ of disease. We shall proceed to consider it in these two\r\nrelations in two different sections. The first will be devoted to the\r\nsymptoms arising from this pollution, the second, to the diseases\r\ncaused by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. SPECIAL SYMPTOMS OF VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe these symptoms, we would remark, 1st\r\nthat the results of venereal excesses are so analogous to those\r\nof involuntary pollution, that it is impossible to point out any\r\ndifference between them: 2d that the general effects of these\r\npollutions, whether voluntary or involuntary, are also extremely\r\nanalogous to those caused by the slow destruction of an organ; those\r\nfor instance observed in phthisis pulmonalis, cancer of the uterus,\r\nprofuse suppurations, chronic diarrhœa, &c. Thus then the results\r\nof masturbation and of coition are the same as those of involuntary\r\nseminal emissions, which is decidedly a disease of the genital organs,\r\nand as those of other severe maladies affecting different parts.\r\nAre not these analogies sufficient to prove that we were correct in\r\nregarding the state in which the genital organs are momentarily when\r\nabused, as a state of disease.\r\n\r\nOne of the most constant effects of excessive masturbation is the\r\nloss of flesh. This symptom shows itself more or less rapidly, and\r\nextends to a greater or less degree. We may regard it as one of the\r\ncircumstances in which onanists most resemble those affected with\r\nphthisis, with diarrhœa, and generally, individuals confined with a\r\nsevere and long continued illness. The loss of flesh arising from\r\nonanism has not unfrequently been attributed to a too precocious growth\r\nand vice versa. This symptom is much more striking in some onanists,\r\nas it is attended with excessive appetite and a healthy state of the\r\ndigestive organs. How great must be the influence of the genital organs\r\nwhen abused, on the nutritive process, to cause this loss of flesh,\r\neven under the conditions most favorable for its gain. It is not\r\nuncommon to see onanists affected with a complete state of marasmus:\r\ntheir frame is reduced to a skeleton and presents in anticipation a\r\npicture of the state in which death will soon place them. Many parts,\r\nas the loins, thighs and lower extremities are often remarkable for\r\ntheir extreme emaciation. Sainte Marie who has observed this fact,\r\nattributes it and also the debility of these parts, to a morbid state\r\nof the spinal marrow, and not unjustly. The facility with which\r\nonanists regain their flesh on leaving off these bad habits, is equally\r\nremarkable with their rapid loss of substance. There are individuals\r\nhowever who remain thin and dried up through life, in consequence of\r\nabusing themselves while young.\r\n\r\nThe loss of strength generally follows the loss of flesh and returns\r\nalso with it. At first debility only follows the act temporarily, but\r\nafterward it continues longer: new emissions of semen take place, and\r\neven before the subject of them has regained the strength exhausted\r\nby a previous indulgence. In the morning he rises from his bed with\r\ndifficulty: during the day he is idle, stupid, and indolent, and\r\npursues his avocations without any spirit. If he goes up stairs, or\r\nascends a hill, his heart beats forcibly, and he pants very much. This\r\ndebility, if the cause which produces it does not cease to act, may\r\nincrease to a frightful degree. We have seen onanists whose bodies were\r\nbent down by the weight of the head and chest and curved as in old\r\nmen: these individuals could not stand erect, their lower extremities\r\ncould not support their weight, and at the least motion they felt giddy\r\nand faint, and finally terminated the remnant of their existence on a\r\nsofa or bed which they could not leave. Many authors, Sanctorius and\r\nTissot among others, have asserted that this debility is greater or\r\nless according to the position of the body during the act of venery;\r\nbut we attach but slight importance to this circumstance, although\r\nthey may have some effect. We think more of Sainte Marie’s opinion,\r\nthat the lower part of the body is frequently weaker than the upper,\r\nbecause the spinal marrow is affected by seminal emissions. As the\r\nflesh returns when the onanist ceases from his bad habits, so too\r\ndoes his strength, and generally rapidly. But there are many, who are\r\naffected during their whole lives with great debility, which unfits\r\nthem for many occupations. It is very common to find individuals who\r\ncomplain of being incapable of any physical effort, and who request\r\ntheir physician to give them strength. On questioning them, almost all\r\nadmit that in their youth they have been addicted to onanism. Some do\r\nnot wait to be questioned but refer to their former excesses as the\r\nsource of their troubles and denounce them as the cause of their actual\r\ndebility. Most invalids however do not refer so far back to the origin\r\nof their illness or even do not dream of it: they remain at peace\r\nwith themselves and their ignorance might deserve to be respected,\r\nif they were not or would not probably be fathers, and if it did not\r\nbecome us to excite their vigilance in regard to their children. Thus\r\nthen venereal abuses may cause not only a transient debility, but an\r\nexhaustion which may be continued, as long as life lasts.\r\n\r\nThe loss of flesh and strength is not the only symptom of consumption\r\nwhich _undermine gradually_ the onanist: many signs indicate that\r\nall the functions are affected as it were with a loss of strength.\r\nThe countenance instead of the vermilion glow of health, is pale and\r\nwithout freshness, or of a yellowish, earthy, leaden, and livid teint;\r\nthe lips lose their color, a bluish circle surrounds the eyes, the\r\neyelids are puffed out with œdema: the flesh is soft and flaccid: the\r\npulse is small and feeble: upon the slightest motion or during sleep,\r\nthe forehead, chest and palms of the hands are bathed with profuse\r\nperspiration: in some patients the hands and feet are edematous: in\r\nshort, the symptoms are those of general atony, which are attended with\r\na slow hectic fever, denoting that the economy does not yield without\r\nreaction to the destructive disease.\r\n\r\nWe ought perhaps to wait before speaking of the disturbance of\r\nthe digestive organs, which almost constantly attends venereal\r\nabuses, until we had finished describing the symptoms of voluntary\r\nspermatorrhœa and were stating the diseases resulting from it. In fact\r\nthe digestion is deranged then only because the digestive organs are\r\ndiseased, and are affected with dyspepsy, gastritis, erteritis, &c.;\r\nbut these derangements are so common after the loss of the seminal\r\nfluid, that we think ourselves authorized to treat these derangements\r\nas symptoms. Venereal excesses may affect the digestive organs in\r\nseveral ways, first by disturbing digestion if they occur while this\r\nprocess is going on: this fact has already been stated. We might\r\nadd that when food is taken too soon after masturbation or coition\r\ndigestion is seldom performed well. This fact did not escape the notice\r\nof Sanctorius, who remarks, _Cibus copiosior solito post immoderatum\r\ncoition interimeret nisi succederet aliqua ciborum corruptela_.\r\nVenereal excesses may also affect the digestive apparatus in another\r\nmanner besides that of directly disturbing its functions. This system\r\nis so intimately connected with all parts of the human body that all\r\nare influenced by it. If then the digestive functions are disturbed by\r\nmost morbid states, can they remain uninjured when so many symptoms\r\nare presented by the genital apparatus which has become the focus of\r\nso many symptoms! Certainly not: these functions also take a part\r\nand a large part in the disorders which are the usual consequences\r\nof venereal excesses. A moderate exercise of the genital organs may\r\nexcite the stomach, render the appetite more keen and the digestion\r\nmore rapid. Hence why young men who begin to masturbate or to indulge\r\nwith women have frequently an insatiable appetite, which leads them to\r\neat constantly, which is very striking inasmuch as debility and loss of\r\nflesh ensue in just the same manner. But such a state of things cannot\r\nlong continue: thus numerous signs soon show that excesses in venery\r\nmay act on the digestive tube in another manner than by rendering the\r\nappetite more keen and the digestion more easy. In fact the appetite\r\ndoes not long resist excesses of onanism: it first diminishes, then\r\ndisappears, and is often replaced by a decided disgust for every kind\r\nof food; in some patients it becomes irregular, capricious: in others\r\nit remains: the latter have most cause of complaint, for it continues\r\nlonger than digestion is performed. “My appetite remains,” writes\r\nan onanist to Tissot, “but it is a misfortune, as eating is followed\r\nby pain in the stomach and my food is rejected.” Many onanists feel\r\npains of a similar character after eating. In others there is a sense\r\nof oppression, of fulness, in the epigastric region. In some there\r\nis a gnawing feeling resembling that produced by a want of food:\r\nthis symptom is very common in girls, who in consequence of secret\r\npractices, have become affected with leucorrhœa. In some the face and\r\ncheeks present a redness which contrasts remarkably with their habitual\r\npaleness: onanists are frequently affected with headache, vertigo,\r\nflushed face, &c. In some the slowness of the digestion is indicated by\r\neructations, which occur long after taking food: or the belly is tense\r\nand filled with wind. Food, which was formerly digested with ease, is\r\nnow oppressive: and the list of articles of diet is shortened every\r\nday. Some onanists have been known in these cases to indulge in ardent\r\nspirits with the vain hope of exciting their appetite, and regaining\r\ntheir strength. Repeated vomitings, constant pain in the belly and a\r\nslow fever are also frequent symptoms of the deep-seated affections of\r\nthe digestive organs. In many patients the intestinal canal is more\r\nliable to be affected by venereal excesses, than the stomach. Obstinate\r\nconstipation in some, diarrhœa and borborygmi in others are the usual\r\nsigns of the affection of this canal. Fournier and Begin mention the\r\ncase of a young man, who almost constantly experienced after excess\r\nin coition, severe colics followed by excessive diarrhœa and an\r\ninsupportable tenesmus. Rest, gummy drinks, the use of farinaceous food\r\nand a small quantity of red wine, soon dissipated these symptoms, which\r\nsometimes threw him into an alarming state of languor and debility.\r\n(_Dict. des. Sc. Med._, _art. Masturbation_.) Hoffman relates a\r\nsimilar case. We have more than once met with similar effects. A young\r\nman whom we attended in 1832 died, after excesses in onanism, with\r\ndiarrhœa. This unfortunate individual, although in the last stages\r\nof consumption, still indulged as soon as he was left alone, in his\r\ndeplorable habit. Diarrhœa, or rather intestinal ulcerations, which are\r\nthen the cause of it, generally appear in onanists as in those affected\r\nwith consumption, at the last stages of life. Thus a young man,\r\nnineteen years old, addicted to masturbation from childhood, died a few\r\nyears since at Hotel Dieu. The most active watching and the strictest\r\nmechanical methods could not arrest his fatal manipulations. Diarrhœa\r\nwas added to his habitual loss of semen, and he died three months after\r\nentering the hospital, in a perfect state of marasmus.\r\n\r\nMany authors have repeated after the statements of Hippocrates, that\r\nindividuals affected with consumption, arising from venereal excesses,\r\nhave no fever. This is an error: they die as we have already stated,\r\nwith true hectic fever, which is caused by the state of the different\r\norgans, and particularly by that of the genital system. Of this,\r\nnumerous instances might be cited: the following is related by Dr.\r\nFederigo, the Italian translator of Portal’s work on consumption. “I\r\nknew,” says he, “a female who was affected for many years with extreme\r\ndebility and entire loss of appetite. A slow fever every evening had\r\nrendered her extremely thin: her eyes were pale and sunken; her skin\r\nwas very hot, and it was highly painful for her to stand erect: a\r\nprofuse discharge weakened her still more; and she was in an advanced\r\nstate of marasmus. All the active remedies, as preparations of iron,\r\ndecoctions of cinchona and mineral waters were tried without success.\r\nShe died in a most deplorable state of consumption. I attempted, by\r\nquestioning her as to her mode of living, to discover the cause of\r\nthis disease, but unsuccessfully. A month before her death however,\r\nshe told me with tears in her eyes, that she brought her debility upon\r\nherself, by indulging constantly and for many years in a secret and\r\nmurderous habit.” We will add that Sainte Marie having found that daily\r\ninvoluntary pollution occurred in diseases of languor, as soon as he\r\nbecame acquainted with the dissertation of Wichmann, discovered that\r\nmany slow nervous fevers were kept up by this affection.\r\n\r\nFrom our remarks on the influence exercised by the genital organs\r\non the nervous system, even when simply in a state of excitement\r\nor repose, it will not surprise, if we should state, that in this\r\nsystem are seen the affections resulting most frequently from the\r\nabuse of these organs. In fact the diseases of motion, sensation\r\nor of intelligence, that is of the faculties which are situated in\r\nthe nervous system, are in fact the most common consequences of\r\nmasturbation, and of venereal excesses generally. We have already\r\nspoken of the gradual diminution in the locomotive powers of the\r\nonanist. That of sensation presents very different phenomena, it is\r\nexalted as much as the first is diminished. Farther it is admitted\r\nthat these two faculties are in an inverse ratio to one another. This\r\nincrease of the susceptibility may take place at any age in consequence\r\nof venereal excesses; but it occurs much more readily in young\r\npersons, that is at that period of life when the mode of sensation\r\nassumes those characters which at a later period more than all the\r\nothers constitute the temperament. Thus the excessive susceptibility\r\ngenerally presented by onanists, does not belong to those transient\r\nsymptoms which disappear when the habit ceases: but, on the contrary,\r\nit continues, long after the habit has ceased, and its influence is\r\nlong felt. How many persons of every age complain of being extremely\r\nnervous. Some know that this depends upon their own conduct, which they\r\ndeeply regret. Interrogate them, and many will admit the excesses of\r\ntheir youth. We have rarely neglected to verify this remark and the\r\nresponses have generally confirmed my suspicions. These individuals are\r\nseldom free from disagreeable feelings, from pain and inconvenience of\r\nsome kind: their symptoms may vary extremely, and change very suddenly,\r\nbut they are generally or always indisposed one way or another.\r\nThis can be readily imagined: every thing affects them: cold, heat,\r\ndryness, moisture, rain, snow, food, drink, exercise, rest, in fact\r\nall these modifying circumstances find in them an organization ready\r\nto be acted on. The act of venery, the first source of their nervous\r\nsusceptibility, subjects them to constant privations. A young man,\r\ntwenty-two years old, whom we attended a few months since, told me in\r\na depressed manner the constant inconveniences which he experienced\r\nfrom onanism. The following is his narrative, which we shall give\r\nhere because it presents a faithful picture of the state in which the\r\nnervous system exists in most persons who have indulged in onanism.\r\n\r\n“At sixteen years of age,” said he, “I learned to masturbate; this\r\nhabit, I continued, for several years, with a kind of fury. My health\r\nsoon became affected, my strength failed and also my digestion. I\r\nsoon perceived a heat and constant pain in my stomach: my throat\r\nwas inflamed and my feelings were extremely bad. The advice which I\r\nreceived and the alteration in my health, caused me to renounce this\r\nhabit. My situation soon improved and I gained daily, but at the same\r\ntime my desires returned and I shortly relapsed into my former errors.\r\nThe same cause produced the same effects and I again abandoned onanism,\r\npromising never to indulge again. For two years I kept my word:\r\nunhappily this time however my health was not restored as at first, and\r\nI continually experienced all the sufferings which I have described.\r\nBesides I have become so sensitive that every thing incommodes me:\r\nthe least change in the weather and particularly a storm causes me a\r\ngreat deal of suffering. Farther I cannot say what temperature is best\r\nfor me, for I do not experience much difference whether it be cold or\r\nwarm. I have but little desire for females, and although indulging at\r\ntimes after long intervals, yet I have always suffered for several days\r\nafterward, in the same manner as after masturbation. I feel constant\r\npains of a lacerating character in the limbs: sometimes also, but more\r\nrarely pains in the back; often also, I have pains in the stomach and\r\ncolic. My digestion although better than before, is far from being\r\ngood: I can take but a few articles of food, and the smallest portion\r\nof wine, spirit, or coffee produces great distress.” This was the\r\nyoung man’s statement: he was deeply affected by the slightest cause:\r\nhis appearance was sad, he was tired of himself and was constantly\r\ntormented by thoughts of his former excesses. I have seen him several\r\ntimes since; and I have reason to believe that his obedience to my\r\nadvice improved his health.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that this patient is a hypochondriac. I admit it: but\r\nwhat is hypochondria, save an excessive susceptibility, added to all\r\nthe inconveniences which result from it, and the derangement of the\r\ndigestive functions? And hence all authors who have spoken of this\r\ndisease, and of hysteria, which resembles it in so many respects, have\r\nclassed venereal excesses among their most common causes. I might\r\ncite in proof of this, Tissot, Louyer-Villermey, Fodéré, Foville and\r\nmany others. Oppenheim, physician to the grand vizier, attributes\r\nthe frequency of hypochondria and of hysteria among the orientals,\r\nto their abuse of the pleasures of love. Pinel gives the history\r\nof a hypochondriac who at the age of puberty abandoned himself to\r\nmasturbation which was followed by frequent involuntary pollutions.\r\nIn another place he speaks of a similar case: and almost every\r\npractitioner can mention several.\r\n\r\nThe affection of the nervous system in onanists consists not only in\r\nan increased susceptibility, but is indicated also, by a number of\r\nsymptoms, as pains sensations and spasms of every kind. Angelot has\r\nrelated the case of a young man affected with constant discharge of\r\nsemen, who, among other phenomena, presented so great a degree of\r\nnervous irritation that he experienced a vibration over his whole\r\nbody at the slightest noise. Some patients experience pains in the\r\nlimbs as if they had been beaten; others are affected with intense\r\nheadache and pains in the loins which reappear at each pollution:\r\nor wandering pains, which however are sometimes fixed, are felt in\r\nthe course of the nerves and are similar to neuralgia. We shall see\r\nhereafter that painful affections of various kinds have been the\r\nmore or less direct consequence of venereal excesses. Sensations of\r\ngiddiness, of formication or crawling, &c., may also be perceived: some\r\npatients experience cramps which at first are felt only during the\r\nact of venery, but which afterwards reappear at other times. Spasms,\r\ncontractions and generally the convulsive motions so often observed\r\nin onanists usually result from severe affections of the nervous\r\ncentres, affections which we shall speak of directly. A very frequent\r\nsymptom and one too which has never deceived me as to its nature, says\r\nGeorget, are palpitations of the heart attended with difficulty in the\r\nrespiration, slight suffocating feelings, &c. He remarks also that\r\nfainting and partial or general trembling appears on the slightest\r\ncontradiction and often without any known cause in onanists. These\r\nremarks are very true: palpitations and stifling sensations continue\r\nsometimes for years after onanism has ceased, and fainting fits,\r\ntrembling sensations, &c. show themselves during or immediately after\r\nthe act of venery.\r\n\r\nThe heart and the mind suffer as much as the body from excesses of\r\nmasturbation. To be assured of this we have only to remember the\r\npower exercised by the genital organs in the physiological state, on\r\nthe ideas and feelings. Generally the necessity which the onanist\r\nexperiences for dissembling his tastes and for concealing a habit which\r\nis both ridiculous and vile, renders him taciturn: his eyes are turned\r\nfrom the gaze of those around: he loves solitude, avoids the world and\r\nis embarrassed, and almost as it were ashamed of himself. His manner\r\nmight sometimes pass for timidity, we might almost say for innocence,\r\nbut it is entirely changed, when being in company with professed\r\nonanists he no longer feels restraint.\r\n\r\nIt is to this habit of dissimulation, this inquietude with which the\r\nonanist is constantly haunted, that Montegre attributes particularly\r\nthe difference between self-pollution and coition: but this moral\r\ntorment is far as we shall see from being the only one with which the\r\nonanist is affected.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he constantly experiences a sensation of sadness and ennui,\r\nwhich is impressed on his countenance and which is the natural\r\nconsequence of restlessness and of the fatigue which he feels\r\nconstantly. He is sad as one is when suffering, and when debility are\r\nfelt. This inward feeling of shame which is banished with difficulty\r\nwhen the actions reputed to be bad are often repeated, must also\r\ncontribute to increase his melancholy and sadness. But perhaps\r\nthe worst feelings which torment him, are regret and remorse. The\r\nexhaustion of his system, his sufferings, the near approach of death\r\noften render him desperate. He remembers the time when he did not\r\nindulge in onanism: he remembers those who first taught him that vice:\r\nhis shame, his pains and fears all come up strongly before him. Being\r\nthe author of his own misfortunes he constantly reproaches himself,\r\nand he remembers all that has been said to wean him from the habit.\r\nNow picture with these regrets these fears, and the despair we have\r\ndescribed, the existence of this fatal habit which cannot be overcome.\r\nThe onanist knows this danger and yet he cannot break himself of his\r\nbad habit.\r\n\r\nIt can readily be supposed that onanists tortured by the present and\r\nby the thoughts of the future which appears to them overshadowed with\r\nclouds, have often wished to terminate their sufferings criminally.\r\nThis has in fact sometimes happened. “I do not believe,” writes an\r\nonanist to Tissot, “that any human being has suffered as much as I\r\nhave. Without the special care of Providence I should find it difficult\r\nto support the burden of life.” Some have not the courage to sustain\r\nlife. Esquirol has often known masturbation to lead to melancholy and\r\nsuicide. Orfila also mentions among the occasional causes of suicide\r\n“the physical and moral disgust, intellectual apathy without any hope\r\nof cure which often follows premature indulgences of every kind.”\r\nIf the resources of nature had been known to those who thus abandon\r\nthemselves to despair; if they had witnessed, as we have, the rapidity\r\nwith which the health is restored, when onanism is arrested, if they\r\nhad believed in the healing power of time, they would have seen that\r\ntheir pains might disappear, their strength might have been restored,\r\nand they might have enjoyed a long and happy life. The following case\r\nwill teach onanists not to despair.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, twenty-four years old, says M. Sainte Marie, in order to\r\navoid conscription shut himself up in an isolated chateau under the\r\ncharge of an old and confidential domestic. There in order to lighten\r\nthe ennui of his situation he gave himself up to onanism. After three\r\nyears of this forced seclusion and dangerous excess, he reappeared in\r\nthe world; he was excessively pale and thin, which was attributed to\r\nthe extreme loneliness in which he existed. Marriage was urged upon\r\nhim as a mode of relieving, by an agreeable establishment, this long\r\nennui; his strength however failed him the night of his marriage,\r\nand he was unable, as Montaigne says, to consummate the nuptials. He\r\nbecame disgusted with himself, and this feeling soon settled into\r\none of deep and fixed despair. One day he swallowed a large dose of\r\narsenic, but vomited it soon after with the food which he had eaten.\r\nHe then came to Lyons to seek a death which he considered more worthy\r\nof his birth and station. He followed very closely for several days a\r\ncelebrated fencer, and finding an opportunity to insult him, did so,\r\nwith no other intent than that of losing, sword in hand, a life which\r\nhad become hateful to him. The fortune of arms decided otherwise:\r\nalthough feeble and languid, he wounded his adversary, and this slight\r\nadvantage suddenly changed his resolution. He now saw that life was not\r\na series of defeats and humiliations: he desired to live, and in this\r\nframe of mind he came to consult me. His impotence seemed but a slight\r\nsymptom. I readily saw that it was only the symptom of a well marked\r\ndorsal consumption. I prescribed ice to be taken internally, iced water\r\ndouches to be used along the vertebral column and a milk diet. After\r\ncontinuing this treatment three months, the patient’s health seemed\r\nperfectly restored. He left Lyons, and rejoined his family, who were\r\nmuch concerned at his long absence. I learn now that he is very happy,\r\nand that his wife has presented him with three living pledges of\r\naffection. (_Wichmann_, _p._ 91.)\r\n\r\nBesides the intellectual and moral effects which we have mentioned,\r\nonanism often produces a very marked debility of the mental faculties,\r\nand particularly of the memory. Young men, who previously showed\r\nconsiderable vivacity of mind and aptitude for study, become, after\r\nbeing addicted to this habit, stupid, and incapable of applying\r\nthemselves: it is evident, that this transitory state which immediately\r\nsucceeds the act of venery, becomes continued when this act is\r\nfrequently repeated, because time is not allowed for the effects of\r\nit to pass off. This debility of the intellectual faculties must not\r\nalways be considered as irremediable: in fact, these individuals\r\nsometimes regain their original acuteness, when the habit which\r\nhad enfeebled them is discontinued, before the deterioration is of\r\nlong standing. We might adduce instances of this return. The most\r\nremarkable, assuredly, is that of an idiot girl, who was restored to\r\nreason by amputation of the clitoris--an operation performed by Dr.\r\nGraefe, of Berlin. In a future page, we shall give this interesting\r\ncase in full. Unfortunately, the simple cessation of onanism is\r\nnot always sufficient to efface its effects completely; and many\r\nindividuals preserve, during their whole existence, a certain\r\nfeebleness of mind, which arises from the excesses of their youth.\r\nThe debility of the intellectual faculties does not always stop at\r\nthe point indicated: it may extend almost to idiocy--to the most\r\ncomplete stupidity. Most generally, then, the brain, or its appendages,\r\nare deeply injured, which is indicated by different symptoms, as\r\nloss of sight, hearing, fits, paralysis, &c. This was the case with\r\nan individual, whose case is stated by Serrurier, and who became,\r\nthrough onanism, perfectly imbecile. This is true, too, of an idiot,\r\nwho was under the charge of Pinel, in the infirmary of Bicêtre. He\r\nwas a sculptor, who had previously been exhausted by intemperance\r\nand venery. He remained almost motionless and quiet, or at intervals\r\nindulged in a foolish laugh. His face was destitute of expression,\r\nand he had no remembrance of his former state. His appetite was\r\nalways good; and, even at the sight of food, his jaws began to move.\r\nHe constantly remained in a recumbent posture; and, finally, became\r\naffected with hectic fever, which terminated fatally.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, in those onanists who become idiots, that,\r\nwhile the external senses and the intelligence diminish, the genital\r\nactivity is increased: all these faculties seem to be blended in\r\none, the proportions of which seem much greater, as the others\r\nare diminished. This opposite state of things, found in all cases\r\nproduced by onanism, is particularly remarkable in a case observed at\r\nthe Hospital St. Louis, by Alibert. The patient was a peasant-girl\r\ntwenty-two years old, who was constantly employed in tending sheep.\r\nThe seclusion of this girl’s situation favored the development of\r\nonanism. She concealed herself in retired and quiet situations, to\r\nindulge this horrid inclination. Two years elapsed, during which her\r\nintellectual faculties were progressively enfeebled: she became stupid,\r\nwhile the venereal sense was excited to the highest degree. Things\r\ncame to such an extent, that she fell, as it were, into a species of\r\nnymphomania, for which she was carried to the hospital. The unfortunate\r\ngirl presented a kind of automatic motion, which she could not repress.\r\nHer head, chest, and upper half of her body were excessively thin,\r\nwhile the other half was remarkably plump. The sight, and much more\r\nthe contact of a male, caused in her a state which was soon terminated\r\nby a pollution. By merely touching this girl, her whole person could\r\nbe agitated and convulsed to a distressing degree, and it was thought\r\nexpedient to send her home. (_Dict. des Sc. Med., Vol. XXXVI., p. 582._)\r\n\r\nAre the alternate states of excitement and collapse experienced by the\r\nbrain, during and after the act of venery, the only cause of weakness\r\nin onanists? Does not the constant state of their mind contribute also,\r\nas Tissot and many other authors think, to this unfortunate result? Of\r\nthis, we have no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe yoke which onanism imposes on those who are completely abandoned\r\nto it, is such, that they have constantly before them a certain set of\r\nideas. All their study is confined to avoid the looks of others, and\r\nto call to mind all the remembrances, and to create all the illusions,\r\nupon which their senses revel: their strength of mind is consecrated\r\nto these objects alone. To dissemble, and enjoy themselves, is all\r\nthey wish. The intellectual faculties, being thus neglected, must\r\nremain imperfect; or even, if we may be allowed the expression, must\r\nlose their vigour, and waste. We can understand well how the necessity\r\narising from this state of things may aid the development of the\r\nmost wicked thoughts. Was not this the case with a young girl, whose\r\nhistory, as stated by Parent Duchatelet, is as follows:--\r\n\r\nThis girl, whose early childhood was spent with her grandmother, a\r\nrespectable and religious woman, was about seven years old, when she\r\nreturned home. For the first four months after her return, she was\r\nvery sad and was not as playful as children are generally, and never\r\ncaressed her father and mother. She lost flesh rapidly. The cause of\r\nthis was sought for in vain; when, one day, a few questions having been\r\nput to her, she stated, that from the age of four years she had been\r\nin the habit of seeing boys from ten to twelve years old; that since\r\nshe had returned home, she had had no opportunity, and had indulged in\r\nself-pollution. In vain did her parents try to wean her from this vice:\r\nthey reasoned with and caressed her; they gave her presents, and all\r\nthe clothes she desired; physicians visited her; the powers of religion\r\nwere tried. But all in vain: the child abused herself, even in her\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nBut a horrid inclination soon appeared: she now desired to see her\r\nparents dead, and even to murder them. This wish she expressed freely,\r\nand also her regret at not being able to satisfy her wishes. She\r\npromised herself to embrace any opportunity which presented. The only\r\nmotives which induced her to do this, were to possess her mother’s\r\njewels, and then to go with the men. Things soon came to such an\r\nextent, that the parents, for their own safety, were obliged to lock\r\nup their daughter every night, as she did not conceal her intention\r\nof assassinating them during sleep. The child, being in this manner\r\nless exposed to observation, abandoned herself to her habits without\r\nconstraint, it being the only wish she could gratify. She never\r\nlaughed, nor cried. She sat the whole day in a very small chair, with\r\nher hands crossed, and she abused herself as soon as her mother’s back\r\nwas turned. Punishments succeeded no better than presents or caresses.\r\nOne day, her father tied her to the bedstead: she said, “You may\r\nkill me; but I will not change.” These facts gave rise to a judicial\r\ninvestigation, from the minutes of which this statement is taken.\r\n(_Arch. d’hygiene et de med. legale_, _January_, 1832.)\r\n\r\nThis young girl certainly had inclinations which were the result of her\r\norganization. She never became attached even to the grandmother who\r\nbrought her up; and whom also she would have destroyed for her jewels.\r\nShe was not animated by the wish to kill, as by that of acquiring a\r\ndesired object. One day, while a man was talking with her, she looked\r\nattentively at his breast-pin: when questioned on the subject, she\r\nadmitted that she would kill this man for the sake of this jewel. Her\r\npassion for venereal pleasures also came from an organic arrangement:\r\nshe had never been led into these enjoyments by men or women. When four\r\nyears old, she sought after little boys; and it was not till she was\r\ndeprived of them, that she resorted to onanism. She admitted that she\r\npreferred the boys.\r\n\r\nNow, I would ask, if this primitive exaltation of a sense, which\r\nmasturbation excited still more every day, could govern a disposition\r\nwhich caused her to regard homicide as the best mode of satisfying\r\ncertain desires? Could that state of fatigue, which is constantly felt\r\nin those individuals who are addicted to onanism, excite in this young\r\ngirl the sympathies which unite each individual to his fellows, and\r\ngive strength to those bonds which she was always ready to break? Was\r\nit possible for her to love her parents, who constantly thwarted her\r\ndesires? Would not the irritation she constantly felt at not being\r\nable to give herself completely up to venereal pleasures, react on\r\nher other inclinations? Would not the obstacles she encountered tend\r\nto make her think herself surrounded with enemies? Governed by one\r\nsense, was she in a state to listen to and understand all that was said\r\nto her, to modify her bad inclinations? Did not her state resemble\r\nthat of animals, who, although mild and amiable, become dangerous and\r\nwicked, when the genital sense is excited? Finally, does not this case\r\nprove that deviations of character may result from onanism--that good\r\nfeelings may be changed by this habit--or, at least, that bad ones may\r\nbe called into action?\r\n\r\nMoral depravity of another kind may result from onanism. The mind,\r\naccustomed to seek pleasure in a certain circle of ideas, or a\r\npeculiar series of sensations, cannot find any in any other manner.\r\nThe enjoyments of onanism are then the only ones which the onanist\r\ncan realize. The union of the sexes has no attraction for him: he\r\nindulges with repugnance, and thinks the sensations much less agreeable\r\nthan those arising from self-pollution. The genital sense, the power\r\nof proceeding to the act of venery, and of procreating, remain: but\r\ndepraved tastes have taken the place of the legitimate desires. Tissot\r\nregards this perversion as more frequent in females than in males: he\r\nremarks upon the case of a female as stated by Bekkers, over whose\r\nmind self-pollution had taken such possession, that she detested the\r\nlegitimate modes of gratification.\r\n\r\nWe believe, that if there are females who prefer onanism to coition,\r\nit is because the sensual results of the latter are generally very\r\nuncertain. Besides, Tissot does not exclude the male sex from this\r\nkind of depravation: the same author states the history of a man, who,\r\nin being taught onanism by his preceptor, experienced, when first\r\nmarried, so great a disgust for the natural relations which result from\r\nit, added to the exhaustion caused by his manipulations, that he became\r\nmelancholy; which state, however, yielded to appropriate remedies.\r\n\r\nA fact published by Alibert is very analogous to the preceding. He\r\nstates, that a young man, brought up in a boarding-house, contracted\r\nthe habit of onanism in his childhood. Tissot’s book was put into\r\nhis hands, which frightened, but did not entirely cure him. After\r\nreading it, however, he was more moderate, and indulged only at long\r\nintervals, and when he was excited by very violent desires. Hence, his\r\ntemperament did not change; but he continued robust, and his moral\r\nfaculties preserved their energy: but the frightful habit which he had\r\ncontracted, prevented the development of any desire for the other sex.\r\nEven when thirty years old, he had never been excited by the sight of a\r\nfemale; and his feelings were called into action only by vain images,\r\nor by the phantoms of his depraved imagination. He had early studied\r\ndrawing, which he had always pursued with ardor. The beautiful forms of\r\nmen, in this beau-ideal of painters, which nature has never realized,\r\naffected him, and finally inspired him with an extraordinary emotion--a\r\nvague passion, for which he could not account. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, to remark, that this passion had no connexion with the tastes\r\nof sodomy, and that it could not be excited by the sight of any man.\r\nSuch was his strange situation, when he came to ask my advice. He then\r\npresented, as I said before, no physical symptom of impotence. He was\r\nhealthy and well-made, and nature had not been unkind to him; but he\r\nhad so abused the use of her gifts, that it was difficult to restore\r\nto him their proper use. The patient was perfectly acquainted with his\r\nsituation. “There is no effort,” said he, “that I am not willing to\r\nmake, to free myself from my ignominious situation--to drive away from\r\nmy thoughts the infamous images which haunt me. They have deprived me\r\nof the legitimate enjoyments procured by the union of the sexes--of the\r\npower possessed by the lowest animals of reproducing their species. I\r\nam dying of chagrin and shame.”\r\n\r\nI considered his disease as a perversion of the venereal appetite. I\r\nthought that the most urgent indication was to restore nature to its\r\ntrue type. In fact, the individual was very robust, at the period\r\nof consulting me; and farther, as I have said, the beauty of the\r\nideal forms of man excited in him voluptuous sensations, during the\r\ncontinuance of which the genital organs became excited, and there was a\r\ndischarge of semen: this favored the supposition that he still retained\r\nsome stamina. Hence, there was neither destruction nor essential\r\nalteration in his physical sensibility; but rather a false direction\r\nof this faculty of the organism. The following course of treatment\r\nwas proposed. I have already said, that the patient was very fond of\r\ndrawing, and that he applied himself to it with that ardor which is\r\nthe sure guaranty of success. I required him to study carefully the\r\nfemale form, and to make drawings of it--to break through his habits,\r\nand to renounce the Belvidere Apollo for the Venus de Medicis. He did\r\nso. Nature gradually resumed her rights: he soon preferred a round\r\nand delicate arm to that which was strong and masculine; and when he\r\ncontemplated the elegance and softness of contour in the female form,\r\nhe began to be cured. After constructing an imaginary model, he sought\r\nfor it in the physical world. Time was required, and perseverance; but\r\nhe was perfectly restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. DISEASES ARISING FROM VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\nThere are but few diseases which have not been observed as occurring\r\nafter venereal excesses. The influence of the genital organs is so\r\ngreat, and extends so perfectly to all points of the organism, that the\r\nslightest morbid disposition of the latter is favored by its action.\r\nCapable of fecundating all the germes of the diseases which occur, the\r\nabuse of the genital organs produces all those which may happen in\r\nthe body. Hence, we must not be astonished to see venereal excesses\r\nmentioned in enumerating the direct or indirect causes of most of them.\r\nWe should certainly sometimes be embarrassed to justify this indication\r\nby positive proofs; for we do not know all that exists, and written\r\nscience does not represent all that has been seen: but, as we know that\r\na powerful influence only requires to exist with a morbid arrangement,\r\nto make of it a disease, the knowledge of this fact alone authorizes us\r\nto place venereal excesses, which have so injurious an effect, among\r\nthe productive causes of most affections of the body.\r\n\r\nThose diseases which are the consequence of this cause generally have\r\na special mark, which depends not only upon the fact, that in a great\r\nmany cases it continues to act when they are developed, and therefore\r\nderanges their course; but which results also particularly from the\r\npresence among their symptoms of those which belong particularly to\r\nvenereal excesses. Hence, if, in consequence of these excesses, an\r\nindividual should be affected with phthisis, epilepsy, a chronic\r\ndisease of the brain, spinal marrow, caries of the vertebræ, &c., the\r\npatient will present, besides the special symptoms of these different\r\naffections, the signs of consumption already mentioned by us, and which\r\nare generally the consequences of the prolonged abuse of masturbation,\r\nor of coition; he will become thin, his strength will be exhausted,\r\nhis eyes will be sunken, and present a dark ring beneath them; his\r\ncountenance will be melancholy and suffused; his digestion will be\r\nderanged; he will suffer from wandering pains, from trembling, and\r\nfrom spasms; his mind will become enfeebled; and, finally, he will\r\nshow many of the phenomena which we have described as general symptoms\r\nof venereal excesses. In these cases, there is, properly speaking, a\r\ncomplication of the special disease which they have produced, and of\r\nthis other disease resulting as we have seen before, from the abuse of\r\nthe genital organs. There are, at the same time, the general effects\r\nof this abuse, which may be seen in all those who are the victims of\r\nit, and the special characters of diseases which might have arisen from\r\nsome other cause. The practitioner who should be unacquainted with\r\nthese facts, in regard to which we find nothing precise in authors,\r\nwould be liable to mistakes which would render him liable to errors of\r\nprognosis and of treatment.\r\n\r\nThe instances of individuals who have died of _apoplexy_, either of\r\nthe cerebrum or cerebellum, during coition, are by no means rare. We\r\ncan readily imagine, that if there be a marked disposition to this\r\ndisease, and that if it be disposed to come on, the derangement in the\r\nrespiration and circulation produced by the venereal action might hurry\r\nit. This has happened more than once during the digestion of a full\r\nmeal. Most old men who have died during coition, have been affected\r\nwith apoplexy. Hence, authors have generally placed venereal excesses\r\namong the causes of this affection.\r\n\r\nWe will mention Cœlius Aurelian, Areltœus, Lomnius, Tissot, Pinel,\r\nCruveilhier, Londe, &c. Henry Van Hers mentions a man, forty years\r\nold, who was attacked with apoplexy while with his wife, the first\r\nnight of his marriage. The attack, however, could not have been very\r\nsevere, as it yielded readily to treatment: but the patient indulging\r\nin the pleasures of love a few days after his recovery, was again\r\nattacked, and died. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, _art. Apoplexie_.) Hoffmann\r\nmentions one. It was that of a soldier, who died in the act of coition.\r\nIt was found, on opening his body, that blood was effused in the\r\nbrain. Serres’ work on the comparative anatomy of the brain states\r\na similar instance. It is that of a man, thirty-two years old, who\r\nbecame affected with apoplexy during coition, and after drinking more\r\nfreely than usual. Firm erection of the penis, which continued nearly\r\nuntil death had closed the scene, was added to the violent symptoms\r\nof apoplexy. The cerebrum was healthy; but the median lobe of the\r\ncerebellum exhibited traces of severe irritation; and the substance\r\nof the cerebellum was broken in several places; and small abscesses,\r\nfilled with blood, were grooved along the superior vermicular process.\r\n\r\nIn some individuals, apoplexy supervenes so soon after venereal\r\nexcesses, that we might reasonably anticipate that they contributed\r\nto its invasion. Thus, a steward, forty-nine years old, whose case is\r\nmentioned by Andral, fell down in the street, on coming from a house\r\nof ill-fame. He was immediately carried to the Maison de Santé, near,\r\nwhere he died shortly afterward. On opening his body, two apoplectic\r\nlesions were found; one in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum, the\r\nother in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum.\r\n\r\nIn coition, a marked congestion of blood takes place toward this\r\norgan. It is fair to presume, that such an act frequently repeated\r\nmay predispose to an attack of apoplexy, which is decided sooner or\r\nlater under the action of different causes. It is a fact, however,\r\nthat this affection occurs frequently in those individuals who are\r\naccustomed to indulge in venereal pleasures. Serres reports the case of\r\na man who indulged frequently, and who was attacked with apoplexy soon\r\nafter a day passed in a house of ill-fame. He died two days afterward,\r\npresenting, among other symptoms, the erection of the penis, and an\r\nabundant discharge of semen. Post mortem examination showed, as in the\r\npreceding cases, apoplexy existing in the cerebellum. A similar case\r\nwas reported by Dr. Guiot. It was that of a man, fifty-two years old,\r\nwho was much addicted to women, and who, after several times suffering\r\nfrom cerebral congestions, was affected with mania. His genital\r\norgans were very much developed, and he was frequently affected with\r\npollutions. He died, finally, of congestion, with hemiplegia, in twelve\r\nhours. Among the symptoms presented, were remarked erection of the\r\npenis, and as it were automatic motions of masturbation.\r\n\r\nDeep and chronic lesions have been observed in the encephalon of\r\nonanists, much more frequently than acute diseases. We published,\r\nin 1817, a case of chronic arachnitis, which seemed to depend on\r\nthis cause. The patient was a boy seven years old, who entered the\r\nHospital des Enfans, at the beginning of the preceding year. This\r\nchild, who was much addicted to masturbation, was usually affected\r\nwith convulsions during this act. He finally became idiotic. He was\r\nextremely repugnant to take exercise, and he remained very quiet. His\r\nstrength failed, his limbs wasted away, and finally he became affected\r\nwith almost total blindness. The hearing, and generally the external\r\nand internal senses were also much weakened. Galvanism and other\r\nremedies were employed in vain. The patient died; and on opening the\r\ncadaver, we found a very marked inflammation of the portion of the\r\nmeninges which follows the course of the superior longitudinal sinus.\r\nThe surface of the brain, also, appeared to some assistants to be\r\ninflamed. In another patient, whose history is stated by Desruelles, in\r\nhis memoir on the effects of onanism, the substance of the brain was\r\naffected. There was paralysis of the left arm, convulsions of the right\r\narm and of the muscles of the face. On opening the cadaver, an encysted\r\nabscess was found in the hemisphere of the brain, on the side opposite\r\nto the paralysis, and corresponding to the convulsed limbs.\r\n\r\nChronic alterations have frequently been found in the cerebellum of\r\nonanists. They have been mentioned by some as the cause, by others as\r\nthe effect of onanism. But even admitting that in some cases these\r\nalterations may have been the beginning of this habit, this fact shows\r\nthe bond which unites the genital organs and the cerebellum, and\r\nrenders more probable the influence which they may exercise upon it. In\r\nfact, when the disease of one organ deranges the functions of another,\r\nwe may be satisfied that an opposite result is possible. Farther,\r\nit would be impossible, in most of the cases of which we speak, to\r\ndistinguish whether the cerebral affection or the masturbation had\r\nprecedence. The only thing positively known is their coincidence; and\r\nthis latter has appeared too frequently not to attract attention. We\r\nwill mention several instances of it.\r\n\r\nA female, addicted at an early age to the pleasures of venery, finally\r\nindulged in prostitution; she was at the same time addicted to\r\nonanism, and at last became affected with nymphomania. Ashamed of her\r\nsituation, she submitted to cauterization of the clitoris, but without\r\nany good result. She finally died; and we found chronic irritation,\r\nwith induration of the middle lobe of the cerebellum. Small sinuses,\r\nwith callous edges, indicated that an inflammation had existed for a\r\nlong time in this organ.\r\n\r\nGall (in his treatise on the functions of the brain, Vol. III., p. 314)\r\nhas given us the history of a boy, three years old, who was strongly\r\naddicted to onanism, and in whom two thirds of the cerebellum was found\r\nto be suppurated.\r\n\r\nA young man, nineteen years old, was so much addicted from his infancy\r\nto masturbation, that all mechanical means were tried in vain to\r\nconquer this fatal habit. It was even proposed to scarify the penis,\r\nin order that his motions might be prevented by pain. All attempts\r\nwere in vain; and this unfortunate young man, exhausted by continual\r\nlosses of semen, died three months after entering Hotel Dieu, in the\r\nmost complete state of marasmus. He had often experienced attacks of\r\nepilepsy. On opening the dead body, we found in his cerebellum an\r\nencephaloid tumor the size of a nut, which had began to soften.\r\n\r\nA girl ten years old, addicted to masturbation, and of a melancholy\r\ntemperament, complained for four months of severe pains in the head.\r\nThese pains increased to such a degree, that for the last three weeks\r\nof her life she was constantly crying. She was finally carried to the\r\nHospital des Enfans. The only additional information obtained in regard\r\nto her was, that the patient was bedridden for twelve days--that she\r\nwas affected with vomiting of bile, followed by somnolence--that for\r\nthree days she had ceased to speak, or answered with difficulty--that\r\nshe constantly kept her hand to her head, which was thrown back. During\r\nthe last four days, she was comatose: there was a slight degree of\r\nstrabismus, and dilatation of the pupil. A post-mortem examination\r\nshowed inflammation, with purulent infiltration of the arachnoid\r\nmembrane, at the upper part of the cerebellum. The substance of the\r\nbrain presented tubercles and a softening.\r\n\r\nCombette has related a case, which to our knowledge is unparalleled;\r\nviz., complete destruction of the cerebellum in a girl eleven years\r\nold, who was addicted to onanism. In place of this organ was found a\r\ngelatiniform membrane, attached to the medulla oblongata by a peduncle\r\nof a similar character. The genital organs of this girl presented\r\nevident marks of her habit: the finger could easily be introduced\r\ninto the vagina; the hymen was absent; the external labia were of a\r\nbright red colour, and seemed to have been frequently irritated. All\r\nthat is known of this patient, who died at the Hospital des Enfans, in\r\n1831, is reduced to a few facts. She was born healthy and well-made,\r\nalthough she was slight; and her physical and intellectual development\r\nwas slow, and very imperfect. On entering the Foundling Hospital the\r\n13th of January, 1830, she was feeble and ricketty, had but little\r\nintelligence, and seemed indifferent to surrounding objects. She\r\nanswered questions with difficulty and hesitation. Her legs, although\r\nfeeble, still supported her; but she fell frequently. She was in the\r\nfull possession of all her senses: her appetite was good. Her health\r\nsuffered more the following months, and she was finally obliged to\r\nremain constantly in bed. Her constitution then appeared impaired, and\r\nshe was as it were stupified. She was depressed, and complained neither\r\nof pleasure nor pain; if questioned, she merely answered yes or no.\r\nShe laid constantly on her back, her head turned to the left, and she\r\nmoved her limbs with great difficulty. She soon became affected with\r\na continual diarrhœa; and she died fifteen months after entering the\r\nhospital, in a state of complete exhaustion. What was the effect of\r\nmasturbation in this case? Was it the cause or effect of the malady,\r\nwhich had disorganized the brain? This habit certainly had a great deal\r\nto do with it. (_Revue Medicale, April, 1831._)\r\n\r\nTo these facts others might easily be added, where the affection\r\nof the brain was manifest, although not verified by a post mortem\r\nobservation: thus, in the following case mentioned by Serrurier, the\r\nepilepsy, loss of sight, and the destruction of the intellectual\r\nfaculties, certainly indicated a deep lesion of the brain. “I always\r\nremember with horror,” says this author, “the frightful picture\r\npresented by a young soldier, after frequent indulgence in onanism,\r\nand of nocturnal pollutions, which were more violent and copious after\r\neach epileptic fit. This young man was in a perfect state of marasmus:\r\nhis sight was lost entirely; he was perfectly imbecile, and even the\r\ncalls of nature were unanswered by him. His body exhaled a particularly\r\nnauseous odour; his skin was livid; his tongue trembled; his eyes were\r\nsunken, his teeth decayed; and his arms were covered with ulcers, which\r\nindicated a scorbutic affection. This state continued for six months,\r\nwhen the melancholy man died, having struggled for a long time against\r\ndeath, which finally terminated his sufferings.”\r\n\r\nIn the preceding case we can remark, in addition to the symptoms of\r\nthe cerebral affection, the symptoms of the exhaustion of the cachexy,\r\npresented by individuals who have been reduced very low by onanism. A\r\nsimilar state is seen in the following case related by Tissot. Here the\r\nencephalic affection, to judge of it by the throwing back of the neck,\r\nand the violent pains experienced by the patient in this part, seemed\r\nto be situated in the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, or in those parts\r\nof the arachnoid membrane which are near them.\r\n\r\nL. D---- was by profession a watchmaker. He had lived prudently, and\r\nhad enjoyed a good state of health, till he was about seventeen years\r\nof age. At this period, he gave himself up to masturbation, which\r\nhe repeated every day, sometimes even to the third time; and the\r\nejaculation was always preceded and followed by a slight insensibility,\r\nand a convulsive motion in the extending muscles of the head, which\r\ndrew it very much back, whilst the neck was extremely swelled. A year\r\nhad not elapsed, before he began to feel a great weakness after every\r\nact. This notification was not sufficient to rescue him from his\r\nfilthy practices: his soul, already devoted to this base habit, was\r\nincapable of forming any other idea, and the repetition of his crime\r\nbecame every day more frequent, till such time as he was in a state\r\nwhich gave reason to apprehend his death. Too late grown wise, the\r\nevil had already made so great a progress, that he was incurable; and\r\nthe genital parts were become so easily irritated, and were so weak,\r\nthat it was no longer necessary that this unhappy youth should be an\r\nagent, in order to shed his seed. The slightest irritation immediately\r\nprocured an imperfect erection, which was constantly followed by an\r\nevacuation of this liquor, which daily increased his weakness. This\r\nspasm, of which he was not before sensible but in consummating the act,\r\nand which ceased therewith, was now become habitual, and frequently\r\nattacked him without any apparent cause, and in so violent a manner,\r\nthat during the whole period of the fit, which sometimes lasted fifteen\r\nhours, and never less than eight, he felt such violent pains in the\r\nback part of the neck, that he did not scream out, but absolutely\r\nhowled; and all this while it was impossible for him to swallow either\r\nsolids or fluids. His voice was become hoarse; but I did not observe\r\nthat it was more so while the fit continued. He entirely lost his\r\nstrength, and was obliged to give up his profession, being altogether\r\nincapacitated: thus overwhelmed with misery, he languished, almost\r\nwithout any assistance, for some months; and was the more to be pitied,\r\nas what memory he had remaining, and which he was at length entirely\r\nbereft of, only served him to take an incessant retrospect of the\r\ncause of his misfortunes, which were increased by all the aggravating\r\nhorrors of remorse. I heard of his situation, and went to him; I found\r\na being that less resembled a living creature than a corpse, lying upon\r\nstraw, meager, pale, and filthy, casting forth an infectious stench;\r\nalmost incapable of motion, a watery palish blood issued from his nose;\r\nsaliva constantly flowed from his mouth: having a diarrhœa, he voided\r\nhis excrement in the bed without knowing it: he had a continual flux\r\nof semen; his sore, watery eyes were deadened to that degree, that he\r\ncould not move them: his pulse was very small, quick, and frequent: it\r\nwas with great difficulty he breathed, reduced almost to a skeleton in\r\nevery part, except his feet, which became œdematous. The disorder of\r\nhis mind was equal to that of his body; devoid of ideas and memory,\r\nincapable of connecting two sentences, without reflection, without\r\nbeing afflicted at his fate, without any other sensation than pain,\r\nwhich returned with every fit, at least every third day. Far below the\r\nbrute creation, he was a spectacle, the horrible sight of which cannot\r\nbe conceived, and it was difficult to discover that he had formerly\r\nmade part of the human species. I had immediate recourse to the\r\nassistance of strengthening remedies, in order to remove these violent\r\nspasmodic fits, which so dreadfully brought him back to sensibility\r\nonly by pain: I contented myself with having given him some ease in\r\nthis respect, and I discontinued administering remedies, which could\r\nnot ameliorate his condition; he died at the end of a few weeks, in\r\nJune, 1757, his whole body having become dropsical.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Bouteille, surgeon-general of the hospital at\r\nLyons, most of the symptoms resulting from the cerebral affection\r\nexisted in the right side of the body, and consequently indicated an\r\naffection of the opposite side of the cerebrum. The patient was a young\r\ngirl twelve years old, whose constitution was weak and irritable, and\r\nvery slightly developed--doubtless, on account of the enervating habit\r\nof onanism, in which she had indulged for several years, and which\r\nher mother’s vigilance could not prevent. Just after recovering from\r\na severe illness, which yielded readily to remedies, this young girl\r\nwas very much terrified, which had a great deal of influence upon her,\r\nas she was extremely sensitive; her sensibility being increased by the\r\nweak state of her nervous system, produced by onanism. Soon after, she\r\nwas affected by slight convulsive motions in the right foot and arm,\r\naccompanied by a disagreeable pain in the right knee and in the sole\r\nof the foot of the same side. Notwithstanding the use of remedies, the\r\ndisease increased, and she was soon unable to carry her food to her\r\nmouth, her arm was so much agitated. The appetite was variable, and\r\nthe pulse was regular. Sometimes, and contrary to her usual custom,\r\nthe patient was silent; sometimes she was extremely lively, and even\r\nfoolish; sometimes her ideas were incoherent, and she often indulged in\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nHeadache and dizziness were perceived, but they soon yielded. At a\r\nlater period, the sight and hearing of the right side were considerably\r\nweakened: at the same time, the pain in the sole of the foot, knee,\r\nand part of the right hand became more intense, and the difficulty\r\nof walking increased. After a time, the disease seemed to improve a\r\nlittle: the convulsive motions abated; the intelligence and memory\r\nreturned, as before the disease; but the sight and hearing remained as\r\nthey were. An active mode of treatment was now used: electricity formed\r\nthe principal remedy. The patient was finally cured. Need we remark,\r\nthat in all probability the fright was only the occasion which excited\r\nthe development of a disease already prepared for by the onanism.\r\n(_Traité de la chosée_, p. 352.)\r\n\r\nThe convulsive form, the _epileptic_, is one of those assumed most\r\nfrequently by the cerebral diseases produced by masturbation; we can\r\neasily conceive of this by remembering, that what takes place in the\r\nact of venery has, as we have already seen, a striking analogy with an\r\nattack of epilepsy: hence the ancients termed the act of coition, _a\r\nshort fit of epilepsy_. It is unnecessary to state here the numerous\r\ntestimonials found in authors, in regard to the influence of onanism as\r\na cause of epilepsy. This influence is a fact mentioned and assented to\r\nby all. We shall relate a few examples.\r\n\r\nThere are some individuals who are so susceptible, and present so\r\ngreat a disposition to epilepsy, that they have a regular attack of\r\nit whenever they indulge in the act of venery. Didier knew a merchant\r\nof Montpelier, of whom this was true. Similar cases are related by\r\nGalen, Van-Hers, Tissot, Hoffmann, Haller, and many other authors. A\r\nsimilar thing is observed even in animals. Alfred Menard had a strong\r\nwatch-dog, who was affected with epilepsy whenever he coupled with a\r\nslut. These attacks were characterized by convulsions, and a loss of\r\nconsciousness: their duration varied, and was always connected with\r\nthe ardour of the animal, who never was affected except under the\r\ncircumstances mentioned. (_Revue medicale_, March, 1825.)\r\n\r\nEpilepsy sometimes supervenes directly after the excesses which cause\r\nit. Cole, cited by Esquirol, relates the case of a female, who became\r\nepileptic three days after marriage: but venereal abuses generally act\r\nslowly, and prepare the body for an attack of epilepsy, which this\r\nor some other cause excites. Esquirol relates the case of a young\r\nman, twelve or thirteen years old, who early in life was addicted to\r\nmasturbation, and became extremely nervous, although strong and robust:\r\nat fifteen years of age he was affected with epilepsy. These attacks\r\ncame on at the moon’s first quarter, and were very sudden: the patient\r\nfell down, uttered loud cries, and was generally convulsed: his eyes\r\nwere open, fixed, and injected: the pupils were very much dilated:\r\nand when the fit passed off, he remained exhausted the rest of the\r\nday. This young man, like most onanists, was extremely susceptible,\r\nfretting upon the slightest pretext. After six months of treatment,\r\nthe attacks became less frequent: at the end of a year they ceased.\r\nThis young man might have been considered cured, but the pleasure of\r\nseeing his mother, from whom he had been separated for two years,\r\ncaused a relapse: the same remedial means were again employed, and with\r\nsuccess. He has, since that, entered into business, and has travelled\r\nextensively: his nervous system is strengthened: he married when\r\ntwenty-seven years old, and has continued in good health.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact has been communicated to us by the celebrated\r\nDr. Goupil. A little boy, only eighteen months old, who had been put\r\nout to nurse, returned home with the habit of masturbation. At first,\r\nhis parents thought but little of this; but when two years old, he\r\nwas affected with an epileptic form of disease, characterized by loss\r\nof consciousness, convulsions of the muscles of the face and eyes,\r\nstiffness of the limbs, and sometimes he fell down. These fits becoming\r\nmore and more frequent, Dr. Goupil was consulted. The patient was now\r\nthree years and a half old, and still continued his bad habit. He was\r\nconstantly sad, morose, and stupid. The doctor, not being at first\r\naware of the cause, employed different medicines, but unsuccessfully:\r\nhe then discovered the cause, and tried mechanical modes. He put on the\r\nboy, at night, a kind of strait jacket, by which his arms were kept\r\ncrossed in front of the chest; and during the daytime, he was watched\r\ncarefully. These means succeeding but imperfectly. Dr. Goupil employed\r\nanother strait waistcoat, which was laced behind, and was furnished\r\nin front with a silver apparatus, to contain the genital organs, and\r\nhaving only an opening for the urine. This new obstacle did not answer\r\nas well as was expected, and the child sometimes escaped all vigilance:\r\nbut as this was rare, he soon gained flesh, and also his strength and\r\nvivacity. The fits of epilepsy gradually became less frequent. This boy\r\nis now from nine to ten years old; enjoys good health; and, with the\r\nexception of a remarkable loss of memory, retains no trace of former\r\nindiscretions.\r\n\r\nThese two cases show how far the system can be restored, when the cause\r\nwhich disturbs it ceases to act. The following, which was communicated\r\nby Zimmerman to Tissot, proves the same thing; but it also shows how\r\nsoon a return to the bad habit destroys the good effects resulting from\r\nits abandonment.\r\n\r\n“I have seen,” says Zimmerman, “a man, twenty-three years old, who\r\nbecame epileptic, after debilitating his body by frequent masturbation.\r\nWhenever he had nocturnal pollutions, a fit of epilepsy ensued; and\r\nthe same thing occurred after masturbation--from which, however, he\r\ndid not abstain, notwithstanding the bad symptoms with which it was\r\nfollowed. After the fit had subsided, he felt very severe pains in the\r\nkidneys, and around the coccyx. Having, however, abstained from his\r\nmanipulations for some time, the pollutions disappeared; and we had\r\nhopes of curing the epilepsy, the attacks of which were less frequent.\r\nHe had regained his strength, appetite, sleep, and color, after\r\nresembling a cadaver; but having returned to his bad habits, which were\r\nalways followed by fits, he was found dead in his chamber one morning,\r\nbathed in blood.”\r\n\r\nAnother convulsive affection, _St. Vitus’ dance_, has sometimes been\r\ncaused by onanism. Marc Ant. Petit has published a case of it, which\r\nwas communicated by Dr. Morelot. It is as follows:--A young girl, eight\r\nyears old, became remarkably thin: her lower limbs were agitated by\r\nextraordinary motions, which were extended to the upper limbs. She soon\r\nlost all control over them. The twitching in the muscles of the face\r\nand eyes was excessive; the patient could not continue in her bed, and\r\nshe was confined to a large chair. Her attending physician thought that\r\nthis might be attributed to the presence of worms, and gave several\r\nanthelminthics, but without success. Dr. Morelot was consulted at\r\nthis period, and thought that he could perceive the effects of a bad\r\nhabit: he soon became convinced of its existence. By means of great\r\nwatchfulness on the part of her parents, the use of cold baths, musk,\r\nand camphor, she was radically cured.\r\n\r\nMental derangement is often the prevalent symptom in diseases of the\r\nbrain, produced by excess of masturbation or coition. We have already\r\nspoken of idiocy; but this is by no means the only change observed\r\nin consequence of these excesses. Every variety of affection of the\r\nmind may be caused by them, as is proved by statistics collected by\r\nseveral authors, in insane asylums. Yet these abstracts are far from\r\npresenting the truth. “So many circumstances combine,” says Esquirol,\r\n“to embarrass the discovery of causes of mental alienation, that the\r\none mentioned, like other causes, must often be unascertained by\r\nphysicians.” According to this sagacious observer of all the forms\r\nof mental alienation, mania is produced least frequently by venereal\r\nexcesses. He adds, that maniacs, during the duration of the periods of\r\naccess, are less addicted, generally, than other deranged persons to\r\nmasturbation; but when they do indulge, this act must be considered as\r\na bad symptom, since it constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to the\r\ncure: it destroys the strength, and finally produces in the patients\r\nstupidity, phthisis, marasmus, and death.\r\n\r\nDementia is, perhaps, the kind of derangement most frequently observed\r\nafter masturbation. I saw a remarkable instance of this disease in\r\na young man, twenty years old, who, indulging in these excesses for\r\nseveral years, gradually lost his mental faculties, became averse\r\nto even his relatives and dearest friends, and finally fell into a\r\nmost perfect state of dementia. The relative frequency of this form\r\nof mental alienation in onanists has been pointed out in France by\r\nEsquirol, and in Norway by Holst. (_Annales d’hygiene publ._ December,\r\n1830.)\r\n\r\nHolst has remarked, that paralysis, that fatal symptom which so\r\nfrequently attends all varieties of derangement, particularly monomania\r\nand dementia, is observed particularly in those insane who are addicted\r\nto onanism, and to other venereal excesses. This remark is confirmed by\r\nthe two facts, that paralysis is much less common in females than in\r\nmales, and that onanism produces mental alienation much less frequently\r\nin the former than in the latter. Thus, of 256 persons, admitted at\r\nthe asylum at Charenton, during 1826-7-8, there were 44 men, in whom\r\nderangement could be attributed to libertinism or to onanism, while\r\nthe same was true of only 3 women. Dr. Holst has shown that a similar\r\nproportion exists between the deranged of the two sexes in Norway. This\r\nrelation, however, must not be considered as strictly correct; for\r\nfemales, being generally very reserved in their disclosures, onanism\r\nprobably passes undiscovered in them more frequently than it does in\r\nmen. It is well ascertained, that one twentieth of the deranged at\r\nSalpetrière, is composed of public women, who are for the most part\r\naffected with dementia and paralysis. Now, consider that masturbation\r\nis much more frequently a cause of derangement among the rich than\r\namong the poor. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, vol. xvi., p. 179.) And\r\nremark, too, that at the Charenton asylum, where only persons in easy\r\ncircumstances are received, there are proportionally more patients with\r\nparalysis than at Bicetre, the population of which is composed of men,\r\nbelonging to the poorest classes of society.\r\n\r\nWe have only to consider the phenomena which attend and usually follow\r\nthe venereal act, to infer that the spinal marrow may frequently\r\nbe affected in consequence of the abuse of that act. Agitation,\r\nthe involuntary contractions of the muscles, particularly of those\r\nsurrounding the pelvis, and the tetanic spasm with which they are\r\naffected at the time of the ejaculation of the semen; the cramps\r\nwhich frequently attend it; the general feeling of pain, fatigue, and\r\ndebility, which follows it--a feeling which is always more perceptible\r\nin the loins and lower part of the body, than elsewhere, indicate the\r\npowerful impression made on the spinal marrow, and the part which\r\nit takes in all going on. This participation is also demonstrated\r\nby different pathological facts, and by the results of experiments\r\nwhich we shall mention, when treating of the influence exercised by\r\naffections of the spinal marrow, as the cause of venereal excesses.\r\n\r\nThe local symptoms of the medulla, in onanists, consist in different\r\nand more or less acute sensations felt along the vertebral column. At\r\nfirst, these sensations do not appear until after the act of venery,\r\nand pass off; they then continue a longer time; and finally become\r\nconstant. The pain is generally of a dull character--inconvenient,\r\nrather than severe--which obliges the patient, when sitting or\r\nstanding, to change his position frequently; and it is generally less\r\nperceptible, or even disappears, when the patient assumes a horizontal\r\nposition. Sometimes there is a feeling as if of ants crawling over the\r\nbody, descending from the head along the spine: this symptom was first\r\nnoticed by Hippocrates. Sometimes, these sensations have a special\r\ncharacter, which each patient expresses in his own manner: thus, a man\r\nwho indulged night and morning, for two years, in coition, complained\r\nto me that he felt beatings constantly between his shoulders. Others\r\nsay that they have a knot in the back. The pains in the spine are\r\nsometimes very severe; sometimes they are extremely sharp. Onanists,\r\nand individuals affected with pollutions, most generally complain of\r\ntheir loins.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of the symptoms mentioned in persons exhausted\r\nby venereal excesses, has caused the terms _consumption_, phthisis\r\ndorsalis, and tabes dorsalis, to be applied to the state which they\r\nthen present.\r\n\r\nThe other symptoms of the affection of the spinal marrow are more\r\nor less severe pains--more or less distinct sensations of cold, of\r\nnumbness, and formication in the limbs, particularly in the lower\r\nextremities; cramps; constant trembling, or convulsive motions in these\r\nparts; a kind of tetanic stiffness; gradual debility of the lower half\r\nof the body; and, finally, paraplegia. We shall find these symptoms, in\r\naddition to the other effects of masturbation, in cases to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nPains in the loins and extremities were very marked in an individual\r\nof whom Serrurier remarks as follows:--“A patient whom I attended\r\nwas reduced to a most dreadful state of marasmus, in consequence of\r\nnocturnal pollutions, determined by venereal excesses. I prescribed\r\na tonic mode of treatment, and varied it in every form; but the\r\npatient died, after four months of frightful pains in the loins and\r\narticulations.” There was apparently, in this case, an affection of\r\nthe lumbar part of the medulla, or of its membranes. A similar malady\r\nexisted, probably, in a man whose case was published by Hattè, and who\r\nwas affected, in consequence of excesses in coition, with a lumbago,\r\nwhich alternated with satyriasis. There is no doubt, in regard to\r\nthe affection of the spinal marrow, in the following case related\r\nby Van Swieten:--“For three years” says he, “I used all the aids of\r\nmedicine for a young man, who, in consequence of onanism, was affected\r\nwith general wandering pains--with a sensation, sometimes of heat,\r\nsometimes of cold, which was extremely unpleasant, over the whole body,\r\nbut particularly in the loins. After a time, these pains diminished\r\nslightly; and then the thighs and legs were so cold, that although\r\nthese parts, on being touched, seemed to preserve their natural heat,\r\nyet he was constantly warming himself at the fire, even during the\r\nwarmer days of summer. I observed, particularly, a constant rotation of\r\nthe testicles in the scrotum; and the patient felt a similar motion in\r\nthe loins, which was very troublesome to him.”\r\n\r\nWas the spinal marrow perfectly healthy in the onanist who wrote to\r\nTissot the following:--“My nerves are extremely weak. My hands have no\r\nstrength: they tremble constantly, and perspire freely. I have violent\r\npains in my stomach, arms, and legs; and sometimes in the kidneys,\r\nchest,” &c. Persuaded, also, from a great many cases, that most of\r\nthe pains termed rheumatic are neuralgic, and that many neuralgias\r\ndepend on an affection of the spinal marrow; I think there is reason to\r\nsuspect this affection, whenever it is found in onanists.\r\n\r\nThe following case, related by Dr. Bertini of Turin, presents, as a\r\nprincipal symptom, convulsive trembling of the lower extremities. The\r\ndisease commenced, as is frequently the case, under the influence of an\r\naccidental cause; but when this had occurred, the patient presented for\r\na long time symptoms of an affection of the medulla; and it is evident\r\nthat their origin must be ascribed to onanism.\r\n\r\nThe patient was twenty-eight years old, and of a lymphatic-bilious\r\ntemperament. When twelve years of age, he became addicted to\r\nmasturbation, and then began to perceive tremblings in the arms and\r\nlegs, vertigo, and pains in the head. He continued his fatal habit till\r\ntwenty-two years old. At the beginning of August, 1824, he was attacked\r\nwith a tertian intermittent, but for this he took no medicine. On the\r\n20th of the same month, while cutting wood in Sesia, and while in a\r\nprofuse perspiration, he went in swimming. He soon felt a sensation\r\nof shivering, followed by cold, spasms, vertigo, pain in the head,\r\nand thirst; aversion to food, difficulty of respiration, sensation\r\nof oppression in the sacrolumbar region, constipation, pains, and\r\ntrembling in the lower extremities. These latter symptoms became so\r\nurgent, that the patient was obliged to have advice. In this state,\r\nhe was carried to the hospital of Vercelli; and in a few days he was\r\nbled eleven times, and drastic purgatives were administered without\r\nsuccess. A month afterward, he left the hospital; and since that time,\r\nthe man has become a beggar and an object of public commiseration. The\r\n18th of October, at which time he came under the charge of Dr. Bertini,\r\nhe presented the following symptoms: he had no fever, nor pains in\r\nthe head, nor derangement in the intellectual faculties; but he had a\r\npain in the two sides of the sacrolumbar region, which was increased\r\nby pressure. The patient complained, also, of a kind of formication in\r\nthe legs and feet, which parts, as also the rest of the body, trembled\r\nconstantly: the agitation was so great, that the patient could not rest\r\nin bed, nor sit without support. Twenty-five leeches were applied to\r\nthe lumbar region, and these drew about twelve ounces of blood. The\r\ntrembling diminished, and the patient could soon rise and walk without\r\na stick, and in fact without assistance. From this time, he felt no\r\npains nor trembling, and he left the hospital eight days afterward. Dr.\r\nBertini has since seen him, and he was well. (_Revue Med._, Dec. 1825.)\r\n\r\nThe tetanic form of the disease of the spinal marrow has rarely been\r\nobserved as arising from onanism. Tissot saw a case of it in a young\r\nman:--“The disease commenced with rigidity of the neck and spine; this\r\nextended successively to all the limbs; and the patient, for some\r\ntime before death, was obliged to lie in bed on his face, unable to\r\nmove either his feet or hands. All motion was impossible; and he was\r\nobliged even to be fed. He lived several weeks in this sad state; and\r\ndied, or rather sunk away, almost without suffering.”\r\n\r\nParalysis, which is the consequence of myelitis, or of any other\r\naffection of the spinal marrow, has been seen much more frequently\r\nthan tetanus, in onanists. It is most generally confined to the lower\r\nparts of the body; but if the disease be seated in the cervical portion\r\nof the spinal marrow, the four extremities may be paralyzed. This was\r\nseen in the case of a young man who was under the care of Dupuytren, in\r\nSeptember, 1833:--\r\n\r\nThis young man was twenty years old: he was very much addicted to\r\nmasturbation, and his disease could be attributed to no other cause.\r\nThis affection had existed for two years, when the patient entered\r\nHotel Dieu. The attack of paralysis had been sudden, like a clap\r\nof thunder: the patient had lost the use of his limbs suddenly.\r\nThe muscles of the neck were paralyzed, and the head fell in any\r\ndirection: a short time before, however, the patient had recovered\r\nthe power of sustaining it. The paralysis of the four limbs, also,\r\nvaried in degree, alternately increasing and diminishing. After the\r\npatient entered the hospital, it was not equal on both sides: thus,\r\nhe had some power over his left arm, but not over his right arm. Both\r\nthe upper limbs, also, were atrophied, or wasted: those of the right\r\nside more so, however, than those of the left. Many remedies had been\r\ntried for this patient, but without success. At the time the case was\r\npublished, purgatives and moxas were proposed. Dupuytren remarked to\r\nhis pupils, that the situation of the myelitis corresponded in this\r\nyoung man to the cervical vertebræ; and that, if it ascended a little,\r\nand extended to the origin of the diaphragmatic nerve, it would cause\r\ndeath. He regarded the passion for masturbation, which existed in this\r\nyoung man, as the probable cause of this myelitis; and, consequently,\r\nof an atrophy of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. (_Lancette\r\nFrançaise_, 1833, p. 339.)\r\n\r\nThe disorganization, also, occupied an elevated portion of the\r\nspinal marrow, in the following case stated by Tissot:--“I was called\r\nupon,” says he, “to visit in the country a man, forty years old, who\r\nhad been very strong and robust, but who had indulged excessively\r\nin sexual commerce and in wine, and who had been often engaged in\r\nathletic exercises. He began to be affected, a few months since, by a\r\nweakness in his legs, which made him totter in his walk, as if drunk.\r\nHe sometimes fell, when walking on a plane; he could not descend\r\nthe stairs without much difficulty; and hardly dared to leave his\r\napartment. His hands trembled very much; he wrote with very great\r\ndifficulty, and very badly; but he dictated with ease, although his\r\nspeech, which had never been very fluent, began to be less so. His\r\nmemory was still good; and the only ground for suspecting a lesion\r\nin his mind was the want of attention at the _jeu de dames_, and the\r\nchange of countenance. His appetite was good, and he slept well; but it\r\nwas difficult for him to turn in bed.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that his gallantries, and a too free use of wine,\r\nwere the first causes of the disease; and that his athletic exercises,\r\nin which he had been frequently engaged, were the origin of the\r\nparticular affection of the muscles. The season was not favorable for\r\nthe use of remedies; but it was necessary to attempt to arrest the\r\nprogress of the disease. I advised frictions of the whole body with\r\nflannels, and some tonics. I directed the doses to be increased, and\r\nto add also the use of the cold bath, at the commencement of summer.\r\nIn a few weeks, the trembling of the hands seemed to be a little\r\ndiminished. A consultation was had in the month of April: the disease\r\nwas attributed to his having written some months, two years since,\r\nin a chamber recently plastered. Warm baths--oily frictions, with\r\ndiaphoretic and anti-spasmodic powders, were employed without benefit.\r\nIn the month of June, in a second consultation, he was advised to visit\r\nthe medicinal spring of Leuk, in Valais. On his return, the trembling\r\nand stiffness had increased. From this time, (Sept. 1760, to Jan.\r\n1764,) I saw him but three or four times. In 1762, he procured from\r\nFrankfort the remedies mentioned in the English treatise, _Onania_,\r\nwhich were of no use. He consulted a foreign physician the last year\r\nwith as little success. The disease has slowly, but daily progressed;\r\nand for several months before death, his legs were too weak to support\r\nthe weight of his body. He could not move his hands nor arms without\r\nhelp; his speech was so embarrassed, and his voice so feeble, that\r\nit was difficult to understand him; the extensor muscles of the head\r\nallowed it to fall continually on the chest; he had constant pains in\r\nthe loins; his sleep and appetite were sensibly diminished. During the\r\nlast few months of his life, there was much difficulty in swallowing;\r\nafter Christmas, there came on an irregular fever, and his eyes were\r\nsingularly dim; when I saw him in the month of January, he passed\r\nthe whole day and most of the night reclining on a sofa, with his\r\nfeet in a chair, with a domestic constantly in attendance near him,\r\nin order to change his position, raise his head to feed him, and to\r\nlisten attentively to all he said. As he approached the period of his\r\ndissolution, he was obliged to articulate letter by letter, which\r\nwas written down as it was pronounced. Seeing that I gave him no\r\nencouragement, as I only employed some palliatives for his fever and\r\noppression, and actuated by a desire of living, he sent one of his\r\nfriends to tell me the cause to which he attributed all these symptoms,\r\nviz., _masturbation_; that he commenced this infamous practice several\r\nyears since; had continued it as long as possible; and that he had\r\nperceived his difficulties increase, in proportion to his indulgence in\r\nit. He confirmed this statement a few days afterward; and it was this\r\nwhich induced him to use the remedies recommended in _Onania_.”\r\n\r\nThis case shows us paralysis confined at first to the abdominal limbs,\r\nbut extending afterward to the upper part of the body. We find a\r\nsimilar case of this progression, in a case related by Olivier, of\r\nAngers:--\r\n\r\n“M--, of a sanguine temperament, of a strong constitution, and of\r\na lively and gay character, had always enjoyed good health until\r\nseventeen years old, when he unfortunately became addicted to\r\nmasturbation. He soon languished, and grew debilitated. Having,\r\nhowever, conquered this fatal habit, his strength gradually returned,\r\nand a proper regimen soon restored him to his former vigor. When\r\ntwenty years old, he perceived a marked debility in the motions of\r\nthe articulation of the right foot; but this disappeared: he was then\r\naffected twice with blenorrhagia, the last attack of which continued\r\nfor several months.\r\n\r\n“When twenty-five years old, he again indulged in masturbation, and\r\nsimilar symptoms to those first presented soon appeared: the lower\r\nextremities, also, became weakened; at times, also, the sensibility of\r\nthe skin was obtuse, and even lost; but it soon reappeared. Under the\r\ninfluence of remedies, the weakness in the limbs diminished slightly.\r\nM-- could walk three quarters of an hour without resting, but he could\r\nnot stand longer; his legs, which were evidently wasted, refusing to\r\nsustain him. He was extremely costive; and since the last attack of\r\nblenorrhagia, the excretion of urine was painful.\r\n\r\n“This affection remained stationary for several years, and then\r\nbecame more serious: the patient was now twenty-nine years old. At\r\nthis period, the paraplegia became complete. He could not walk, nor\r\neven support himself on crutches; his lower limbs were often stiff;\r\nboth arms, also, were at times insensible; and sometimes the sense of\r\ntouch was blunted. The wasting away had increased; the excretion of\r\nurine was often involuntary, and the constipation was habitual. He was\r\nsomewhat benefited by Hallé’s prescriptions, consisting in frictions\r\nwith cantharides, and douches to the spine; but the next year the evil\r\nincreased, the sensibility in the hands diminished, and there was\r\ndifficulty in moving the right hand.\r\n\r\n“Eighteen months afterward, the lower extremities became perfectly\r\nparalyzed: they were less warm than the rest of the body; yet, when\r\ncold water was applied to them, it produced a burning sensation. The\r\nright arm, forearm, and hand, often felt fatigue: its motions were\r\nless free, and the patient sometimes found it difficult to write. The\r\nlimb of the opposite side was not affected. The disease of the bladder,\r\nwhich had existed for several years, was also increased.\r\n\r\n“Paralysis, during the following years, progressed slowly, but\r\nconstantly. The arm of the right side lost its motion entirely; the\r\nforearm was flexed upon it, and retained this position. At a later\r\nperiod, the fingers became stiff, crooked, and they continued to be\r\nso flexed, that a tampon of linen was placed on the palm of the hand,\r\nto prevent the nails from lacerating the skin. A singular symptom,\r\nalso, appeared: if the internal part of the thigh was gently rubbed,\r\nthe limbs extended quickly, as if by a galvanic shock, and then\r\nresumed their first position, which was that of a permanent state of\r\nsemiflexion.\r\n\r\nThe paralysis finally affected the left upper extremity, which had\r\nhitherto been free from it; at the same time, the respiration became\r\nmore difficult, the voice more feeble, and speech more painful, so\r\nthat the patient choked, after talking a few moments. These different\r\nsymptoms, and those described above, gradually became intense; and\r\nat the time this case was recorded, the patient was still alive--but\r\nin a most lamentable situation. Very severe pains supervened in the\r\nright side; the limbs were frequently convulsed; the constipation was\r\nobstinate; the urine passed involuntarily; the intellectual faculties,\r\nhowever, remained unaffected; and the patient, who was then fifty\r\nyears old, proved, by his easy and agreeable conversation, that,\r\nnotwithstanding his unfortunate situation, he had lost none of his\r\nnatural gayety of character.” (_Traité de la moelle epinière_, &c.,\r\nvol. ii., p. 594.)\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the medulla alone was affected in an individual whose\r\ncase is mentioned by Tissot.\r\n\r\nIn another case related by Weszpremi, the spinal marrow and brain\r\nwere affected. The patient, who was thirty years old, complained of\r\npains along the spine, especially when he stooped. His legs were so\r\nweak, that he could scarcely stand erect for a moment; his memory\r\nwas considerably weakened, and he seemed stupid; his sight was also\r\naffected, and he was extremely thin. This man, having long denied the\r\ncause of his disease, finally confessed it. After some months, his\r\nhealth was restored. (_Observ. Med._, p. 175.)\r\n\r\nThe disease is not always confined to the spinal marrow, and\r\nits membranes: it frequently extends to the parts adjacent, and\r\nparticularly to the vertebræ. The latter are then destroyed; and the\r\ndisease described by Pott, and which takes his name, appears. Sabatier\r\nwas aware of the influence of masturbation on the bony part of the\r\nvertebral column. “The most terrible and most frequent results of\r\nonanism,” says he, in a letter to M. A. Petit, “are nodosities of the\r\nspine. My opinion has always been regarded as unfounded, on account of\r\nthe youth of the patients; but I was enlightened by the admission of\r\nsome of my patients, that many were guilty of this thing before their\r\nsixteenth year.” This fact, which was afterward stated by Boyer, in his\r\nlectures, is now no longer doubted. The relation, however, between the\r\ncaries of the bodies of the vertebræ in onanists, and the affection of\r\nthe medulla, or of its membranes, had not been observed; it had not\r\nbeen remarked that this latter always precedes caries, which in this\r\ncase is only the result of the extension of the primitive disease. The\r\nfacts which are to be stated will prove this to be true.\r\n\r\nL. E. G., twenty-one years old, a turner, of a lymphatic temperament,\r\nof a slender and delicate constitution, addicted to masturbation\r\nfrom childhood, experienced, at the beginning of February, 1825, a\r\nslight pain in the epigastric region, difficulty of digestion, and\r\nconstipation: he also had laborious breathing, caused by palpitations,\r\nwhich were much increased by walking, and particularly by going up\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nOn entering the hospital la Pitié, April 28th, 1825, this young man\r\npresented all the symptoms of a hypertrophy of the left cavities\r\nof the heart: these phenomena, which diminished after a few days,\r\nwere followed by symptoms of enteritis and peritonitis, which were\r\nattributed to excesses in eating. During the continuance of this\r\nlatter affection, the patient complained of uncommon debility in the\r\nabdominal limbs. These symptoms disappeared; and when it was expected\r\nto see the patient convalescent, he was affected with complete\r\nparaplegia. He lost the use of his legs: they, however, retained their\r\nsensibility. As motion in them was lost, this sensibility was even\r\nincreased; for the patient cried whenever he was touched, or when\r\nthe position of the lower limbs was changed. The bladder was soon\r\nparalyzed, and the sound was used, which caused inflammation of this\r\norgan. A broad and deep eschar, followed by ulceration, laid bare\r\nthe whole posterior part of the pelvis. From this time, the symptoms\r\nincreased more and more, and the patient died the 11th of August, about\r\nsix weeks after the first symptoms appeared.\r\n\r\nOn opening the body, a softened tubercle was found on the surface\r\nof the right hemisphere of the brain; _the body of the third dorsal\r\nvertebra was slightly changed_; the corresponding portion of the dura\r\nmater presented a cancerous degenerescence, which extended from the\r\nbody of the third dorsal to that of the fifth cervical vertebra. The\r\nbodies of all the vertebræ connected with this alteration were whitish,\r\nand slightly softened. The tissue of the spinal marrow was softened,\r\nespecially on the level with the seventh cervical and first three\r\ndorsal vertebræ: the softening occupied the anterior cords, which were\r\nof a grayish white color; the posterior cords were slightly softened\r\nbut only on a level with the first three dorsal vertebræ The lungs\r\nwere healthy and crepitating; the right contained superiorly a small\r\nsoftened tubercle. _The heart was healthy_: its size was normal; the\r\nleft cavities possessed their usual size and thickness. Traces of\r\ninflammation were found in the peritoneum, intestines, and bladder.\r\n(_Journal de Physiol. Experim._ July, 1825.)\r\n\r\nIn this case, we see in a measure the mode in which caries of the\r\nvertebræ is produced. This caries is only at its commencement; the\r\nvertebræ are affected superficially, and in those parts only which\r\ncorrespond to the diseased portions of the dura mater and medulla.\r\nThere are none of the local symptoms of Pott’s disease--no collapse of\r\nthe vertebral column--no gibbosity; yet the paraplegia appeared, as\r\nin the cases where these alterations exist: it resulted, then, from\r\nthe softening of the medulla, or the alteration of its membranes. If\r\na little time had elapsed, and several spinous processes had deviated\r\nfrom their true direction, this paralysis would have been attributed\r\nto the commencement and progress of this deviation. These relations\r\nbetween the state of the medulla and that of the vertebræ have been\r\nalready remarked by several authors. M. Latour, in a memoir inserted\r\namong those of the Society of Emulation, has sought to establish that\r\nparaplegia, in Pott’s disease, resulted from a primitive alteration of\r\nthe medulla. Janson has since expressed a similar opinion. Cases have\r\nalso been published by Louis, which leave little doubt on this subject.\r\n(_Mem. and Recherches_, 1826, p. 410.)\r\n\r\nOne symptom in the preceding case, which deserves to be noted, is the\r\ndifficulty of respiration, the palpitations, and other symptoms which\r\nled to the belief that the heart was diseased. On opening the body,\r\nhowever, this organ was found perfectly healthy. Similar phenomena are\r\noften seen in onanists: it would therefore be wrong to consider them\r\nalways as signs of an organic alteration of the heart and large vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the following case, the vertebræ were more changed. The spinal\r\ncolumn was gibbous: but this was preceded by paraplegia, and other\r\nsymptoms of myelitis. This case was published by M. Dalandeterie:--\r\n\r\nA shoemaker, twenty-four years old, of good constitution, who has\r\nalways enjoyed good health, contracted the habit of masturbation at the\r\nage of sixteen years, and became so addicted to it, that he indulged\r\nseven or eight times a-day: his strength soon diminished, and he lost\r\nflesh and his color.\r\n\r\nAfter an interruption, caused by an acute disease, the patient resumed\r\nhis fatal habit with the same earnestness. He finally became so weak;\r\nlanguid, and pale, that he was discharged from military service, in\r\nwhich he was inscribed.\r\n\r\nA little while afterward, this young man, who had never shown any\r\nsymptoms of scrofula, presented scrofulous engorgements in the groins\r\nand axillæ, and swellings, with caries, in several phalanges of the\r\nfingers. At the same time, a singular phenomenon appeared: the hair,\r\nwhich was chestnut colored, came off; on growing again, it appeared\r\nof several colors: but after coming off once or twice, it resumed its\r\nnatural shade.\r\n\r\nThe patient continuing to indulge in onanism, finally became extremely\r\nweak, and was obliged to keep his bed. Marked symptoms of myelitis\r\nnow appeared. The patient gradually lost the use of his lower limbs:\r\nfirst they became weak, and showed a disposition to be crossed; but\r\nfinally wasted away, and lost the power of motion. He was now obliged\r\neven to be turned in bed, as he could not move. The articulation of\r\nthe feet and knees became stiff and inflexible, and his legs were so\r\nmuch retracted, that the end of the foot only touched the ground, when\r\nthe patient was placed in an erect position. The sensibility of the\r\nlimbs, also, was as much affected as their motions; they were cold,\r\nnumb, and even when pinched they were not painful. The general languor\r\nwas increased every day. He suffered from thirst, dyspepsia, pains in\r\nthe stomach, rumblings, night sweats, &c. At this period, the patient\r\nquitted a woman with whom he had lived for a year, and who, having but\r\nlittle inclination for coition, caused him to indulge in masturbation.\r\n\r\nThe erections were frequent, powerful, short, and always terminated\r\nwith a more or less abundant discharge of mucus from the\r\nurethra--perhaps, also from the prostate gland; or even the discharge\r\nmight be of thin semen. After a while, the ejaculations were composed,\r\ninstead of semen, of a half-clotted, blackish or yellowish blood:\r\nsometimes, as much as a tablespoonful was lost. These emissions were\r\nalways painful, and were followed by extreme prostration.\r\n\r\nFor some time, the patient was in this sad state, when he experienced\r\na crawling sensation, like that caused by ants, descending along the\r\nback: he experienced, in the same region, a severe and fatiguing pain,\r\nwhich extended into the ribs and loins. These symptoms subsided; but\r\nat the lower part of the dorsal region appeared a hard tumor, which\r\nat first was small; but it gradually enlarged, as long as the patient\r\ncontinued to masturbate. This tumor was evidently formed by the curve\r\nof the spine, and the projection of three spinous processes.\r\n\r\nIn three months, the patient was improved by the use of moxas and of\r\nantiscrofulous remedies, by a suitable regimen, and particularly by\r\nabstaining from onanism, for which he had conceived not only disgust,\r\nbut even a horror. The abdominal limbs regained their strength, heat,\r\nand sensibility; the patient could walk on crutches, and could even\r\nstand erect for a few moments, and could take a few steps unaided.\r\n\r\nIn this case, which is remarkable in more than one respect, the\r\nsymptoms of myelitis preceded the curve of the spine, and then\r\ndisappeared, although the spine did not regain its primitive\r\nrectitude. The debility, numbness, retraction, and paralysis of the\r\nlimbs, appeared long before the pain in the back, after which the\r\ncurve in the back began to appear; and then these limbs regained\r\ntheir sensibility, force, and motion, while the gibbosity remained\r\nalways the same. This curve, then, could not be the cause of the\r\nparaplegia, because the latter appeared first, and the spine remained\r\ncurved after the paralysis was removed. The development of symptoms\r\napparently scrofulous, in a man more than twenty years old, who had\r\nhitherto presented nothing analogous, and whose parents were healthy;\r\nthe loss of his hair; the affection of the seminal passages, and the\r\nstate of the genital organs, &c., &c.--facts to which we shall recur\r\nhereafter--all contribute to render this case interesting.\r\n\r\nWe shall see, in the following case, also related by M. Dalandeterie,\r\nan instance of vertebral caries in an onanist:--\r\n\r\nA cook, forty-five years old, of bad constitution, but having always\r\nenjoyed robust health, indulged in masturbation, although not to\r\nvery great excess. Eighteen months before his case was published,\r\nhe perceived pains and weakness in the loins, frequent colics,\r\noften followed by brownish dejections, and sometimes by obstinate\r\nconstipation. He suffered, too, from flatulency; and in the left haunch\r\nthere was a pain, which increased or diminished with this flatulence.\r\n\r\nThe patient, notwithstanding the progress of these symptoms, continued\r\nto masturbate. Debility and pains in his loins extended into the\r\nabdominal limbs, and increased so much, that he was obliged to keep\r\nhis bed: he could only lie on his left side; but in this position his\r\nmotions were easy. The diminution in the natural heat, the livid color\r\nof the skin, the softness and flaccidity of the flesh, debility, loss\r\nof sleep and of flesh, thirst, constipation, &c., were added to the\r\nsymptoms already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a hard, indolent tumor, the size of a pullet’s egg,\r\nwas formed at the lower part of the dorsal region. This tumor, which\r\ndid not enlarge, evidently resulted from the prominence of the spinous\r\nprocesses, and consequently from a curve in the spine, which was\r\ndoubtless caused by a softening of the bodies of the vertebræ.\r\n\r\nNearly at the same period, there was developed, at the lower part\r\nof the sternum, a hard, indolent tumor; the color of the skin was\r\nunchanged: it gradually became the size of a nut, suppurated, and\r\nassumed the appearance of a scrofulous ulcer. The lymphatic ganglions\r\nof the neck, which were somewhat swelled, now returned to their natural\r\nsize. The treatment was similar to that used in the former case, and\r\nwas attended with the same result: the strength, bodily heat, and\r\nappetite returned. Finally, the patient was able to walk with crutches;\r\nand could stand, unsupported, for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in this case are not detailed with sufficient\r\naccuracy, to enable us to follow exactly the cause of the symptoms. We\r\nwould remark, however, that one of these seen first was the neuralgic\r\npains, which extended from the loins into the lower extremities. Now,\r\nas this symptom belongs to irritation of the medulla or its membranes,\r\nmore than to their compression, there is reason to think that this\r\nirritation preceded the curve of the spine. In this patient, also, as\r\nin the preceding case, the affection of the marrow had not so much\r\ninfluence in causing the destruction of the bodies of the vertebræ, as\r\na disposition to caries--a disposition which was evidently increased by\r\nonanism, and which appeared at the same time in several bones.\r\n\r\nThe following case, from Meyrieu, is not sufficiently detailed, to\r\naffect in any manner the question, how caries of the vertebræ is\r\nproduced in onanists; but it is interesting, as it shows that the\r\ndisease may extend to the soft parts which cover or are adjacent to the\r\naffected vertebræ.\r\n\r\nL--, twenty-two years old, was moderately tall, with a narrow chest,\r\nand had never enjoyed good health, particularly for the six years\r\npreceding the time when he entered the prison at Bicetre, when he\r\nindulged in the disgusting practice of onanism. In the course of\r\nJanuary, 1819, he was affected with general numbness, with frequent\r\ncough and expectoration of mucus: these symptoms were occasionally\r\nattended with slight fever. When admitted to the infirmary, the 1st of\r\nFebruary, he complained, in addition to the symptoms already mentioned,\r\nof a violent pain in the posterior part of the neck. A slight swelling\r\nwas seen at the level of the first and second cervical vertebræ, and\r\npressure on that part was painful; the head was bent to the left side,\r\nand remained motionless; the thoracic abdominal limbs were numb; and\r\ndeglutition was painful. Local resolvent frictions, blisters, and moxas\r\nwere used. The 15th of February, he was affected with hemoptysis,\r\nwhich yielded in two days to the use of bleeding and astringents.\r\nThe vertebral disease, however, generally made progress, like that\r\nof the chest, which seemed to relax. In July, the thoracic limbs\r\nwere perfectly paralyzed; and in August, this was true also of the\r\nabdominal limbs. At this period, the head was absolutely immoveable;\r\nthe phthisis seemed as yet in the second degree. Finally, the patient\r\ndied suddenly, from moving his head, while the attendants were changing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem Examination._ The soft parts of the posterior region of\r\nthe neck were changed to a whitish, lardaceous substance; the right\r\ncondyle of the occipital bone was carious: there was also a deep caries\r\nof the upper part of the right lateral mass of the first vertebræ, and\r\nof the odontoid process. The transverse and odontoid ligaments were\r\ndegenerated and softened; and the medulla oblongata presented a kind\r\nof strangulation, resulting from the compression caused by the left\r\nposterior part of the edge of the occipital foramen: in fact, there\r\nwas a dislocation of this bone, on the first vertebræ. The cerebrum\r\nwas unaffected; the right lung was tuberculous, and very small; that\r\nof the left side was also tuberculous, but was larger. The peritoneum\r\npresented some marks of inflammation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding cases, the caries of the vertebræ was not attended\r\nwith a congested abscess. The following case, published by Levêque\r\nLasource, will present to us this symptom, which is so common in this\r\ndisease:--\r\n\r\nN-- O-- was addicted to onanism, from twelve to eighteen years of age;\r\nbut could not renounce this fatal habit, although reminded of its\r\ndanger by a curve in the spine, and by other symptoms. When received\r\nat la Charité Hospital, in 1806, beside a well marked gibbosity, he\r\npresented a congested abscess at the upper and inner part of the thigh.\r\nTwo cauteries were applied to the sides of the vertebral prominences:\r\nthese suppurated freely, but did no good. The abscess was punctured\r\nin several places. This young man, who could not survive, left the\r\nhospital; so that the organic changes produced by his disease could not\r\nbe verified. (_Jour. de Med., Chir. and Phar._; vol. xvii., p. 261.)\r\n\r\nThe same author has related another case, which terminated more\r\nfortunately:--A child, seven or eight years old, addicted to\r\nmasturbation, entered at la Charité, affected with gibbosity and\r\nparalysis of the lower limbs. During the month he stayed in the\r\nhospital, several cauteries were applied around the tumor, which\r\nsuppurated; tonics and strengthening medicines were administered\r\ninternally. He left, perfectly cured of the paralysis, and of the other\r\nsymptoms caused by the affection of the medulla; but the deformity\r\nresulting from the prominence formed by the spinous processes of the\r\nvertebræ continued. Three years after, this child, who had abstained\r\nfrom this bad habit, had experienced no relapse.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in several of the preceding cases, that permanent\r\ncontractions of the lower limbs resulted, in onanists, from affections\r\nof the spinal marrow. Guersent, also, admits the possibility of\r\nessential contractions--that is, those which do not result from a\r\ndisease of the nervous centres. According to this practitioner, these\r\nkinds of contractions are seen most frequently in those nervous\r\nchildren who indulge in bad habits, like that of masturbation. The\r\nfollowing case has been considered by him as an instance of this\r\naffection:--\r\n\r\nD-- E--, five years old, and addicted to masturbation, after passing\r\na part of the winter at the Hospital des Enfans, to be treated for\r\nscrofulous engorgements of the glands of the neck, was sent to the\r\ncountry in the spring. He had been there about three months, when he\r\nwas suddenly affected with a contraction of the lower extremities.\r\nExamined the 5th of July, he complained neither of pain in the head\r\nnor spine. The digestive passages were in very good state; there was\r\nno derangement in the circulation or respiration; the muscles of\r\nthe lower extremities were permanently rigid: the tension, however,\r\nwas more marked in the adductors; for the patient constantly kept\r\nhis knees crossed. There was no deviation in the vertebral column.\r\nDifferent remedies were employed, but without success; except a little\r\nimprovement under the use of carbonate of iron. The legs and thighs\r\nof the patient could be flexed and extended with the hands; but he\r\ncould neither flex them when extended, nor extend them when flexed.\r\nThis child was cured in a singular manner. His state was as described,\r\nwhen, at the beginning of September, he was affected with symptoms\r\nof roseola. The contraction of the lower extremities disappeared,\r\nwhen the fever came on. The eruption went through its course, and the\r\ncontraction of the limbs did not return. Thus, this disease, which\r\nhad resisted several efficacious remedies, disappeared before another\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe loss or debility of the external senses, particularly those of\r\nhearing and sight, when this state is the consequence of venereal\r\nexcesses, often result, as may be seen in several of the cases above\r\nstated, from a disease of the brain. This organ was probably diseased\r\nin the old man whose case was mentioned by Réveillé Parise. This man\r\nwas desirous of living with a young Italian girl, whose temperament\r\nwas extremely ardent. He paid for his imprudence by blindness, which\r\noccurred in eight days, and which was followed by death. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the eye alone is diseased: at least, the pathological\r\nstate which it presents is unattended by any symptoms indicating an\r\naffection of the brain or its membranes. Many libertines present only\r\nan irritation of the conjunctiva and of the edge of the eyelids. It is\r\na sort of chronic ophthalmia; their eyes are red, watery, fatigued,\r\npainful; and they cannot engage in the evening in any occupation,\r\nsuch as reading, which requires the attention to be confined to one\r\nobject. Sometimes, a severe and deep-seated pain proves that, beside\r\nthe outer parts of the eye, the interior of this organ is the seat of\r\na severe irritation. Hoffmann has seen several cases of this. He cites\r\nthat of a young man, who indulged in onanism from the age of fifteen\r\nto that of twenty-three. “His eyes and head were so weak,” says he,\r\n“that these organs were often affected with violent spasms, during the\r\nemission of semen. Whenever he attempted to read, he experienced a\r\nsensation similar to that of drunkenness: the pupil was considerably\r\ndilated, and excessive pains were felt in the eye. The eyelids were\r\nglued together every night; the eyes were also watery; and there was,\r\nat the two angles, a collection of whitish matter. These irritations,\r\nespecially when seated within the eye, may be followed by the loss\r\nof sight.” Dr. Juengken, professor of clinical ophthalmology at the\r\nBerlin faculty, and who has published an excellent work on the diseases\r\nof the eye, indicates, when speaking of amaurosis resulting from\r\nmasturbation, that the pupil assumes a peculiar form, which is found\r\nonly (says this professor) in those individuals habitually addicted to\r\nthis vice. In these cases, the pupil, instead of being in the centre of\r\nthe eye, is removed upward, but does not lose its roundness: the upper\r\npart of the iris seems narrower, and contracted on its ciliary edge.\r\nThis symptom has been mentioned, also, by Dr. Sichel, as occurring in\r\ncertain scrofulous ophthalmias: iritis then exists. Photophobia, which\r\nis a greater or less aversion to light, resulting from the pain which\r\nit occasions in the eye, has been indicated, by Sanson, as sometimes\r\npreceding amaurosis, caused by too frequent a loss of semen.\r\n\r\nAll authors agree in placing venereal excesses, and particularly\r\nthose from masturbation, among the causes of amaurosis. They are so\r\nunanimous on this point, that we shall cite no authorities. They\r\ngenerally agree to regard amaurosis, in onanists, as produced by the\r\nexhaustion caused by diurnal or nocturnal pollutions. Beer, and many\r\nothers, assimilate, in this respect, the loss of semen to that of other\r\nfluids; and compares venereal excesses, especially those from onanism,\r\nwith cholera, diarrhœa, &c., as a cause of amaurosis. This idea of\r\nexhaustion probably led Scarpa to remark, that amaurosis, resulting\r\nfrom premature abuses of masturbation or coition, must generally be\r\nregarded as incurable. This prognosis may be made, we believe, in\r\nregard to most cases of amaurosis. Dr. Buzzi has published, with four\r\nother cases of amaurosis, which were cured, that of an individual in\r\nwhom it had been produced by masturbation. It, however, yielded, on the\r\nabandonment of bad habits, to the moderate use of good wine, combined\r\nwith milk diet.\r\n\r\nDr. Rognetta, in a memoir on the causes of amaurosis, insists on\r\nthe opinion that onanism produces this disease, by exhausting the\r\nsensibility of the body. He compares this habit to decay. “Nothing,”\r\nsays he, “enervates the body so much as too frequent emissions of\r\nsemen, especially when they are caused by the hand: the spasm which\r\nattends them throws the body into all the infirmities of old age. The\r\nretina and optic nerve then gradually lose their sensitive faculty,\r\nwhich finally becomes extinct. Those who masturbate are affected with\r\namaurosis, like decrepit old men.” Rognetta adds, that he has the\r\nnotes of several cases of amaurosis, which had resisted all remedies,\r\nand which were caused entirely by the _luxuria manuensis_. He relates\r\nthe history of a young ecclesiastic, nineteen years old, a native of\r\nPalermo, whose sight became very weak. This unfortunate young man had\r\nbeen in the habit of masturbating seven times a-day: he was also prone\r\nto sodomy. Rognetta advised him to leave off this bad habit, and to\r\nreturn to his native place and take cold baths.\r\n\r\nSanson, also, places voluntary and involuntary pollutions among the\r\nasthenic causes of amaurosis: he, however, regards these pollutions as\r\nsometimes causing irritation of the retina. He assimilates them, as do\r\nmany other authors, to all abundant discharges of fluids. The following\r\ncase has been considered by him as one of asthenic amaurosis, produced\r\nin this manner:--A notary’s clerk, twenty-four years old, experienced\r\nfor a year a progressive debility in his sight. He had labored much at\r\nnight, by lamp-light, and attributed his disease to this cause; but\r\nanother, which had contributed to the development of the amaurosis,\r\nwas the excesses of this young man, in onanism and coition. Venereal\r\ndisease, which he had contracted, might also contribute to this bad\r\nresult. The pupil was dilated; the iris was immoveable; the eye was\r\nperfectly clear; and the retina, of a dull color, could be seen through\r\nthe pupil. An antivenereal treatment, purgatives, emetics, and\r\nblisters around the organ, &c., produced no effect.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, blindness from amaurosis, being not so much a disease as\r\na symptom, or rather the consequence, of many other diseases, is not,\r\nin onanists, the result of exhaustion, of asthenia, any more than the\r\ndebility and paralysis of the lower extremities are, when the spinal\r\nmarrow is diseased. Besides, what difference does it make, how the\r\nsight is lost in onanists? the most essential thing to be known is,\r\nthat they can lose it. This unfortunate circumstance is to be dreaded\r\nby those whose sight is much affected during the act of venery, and\r\nwho remain, as it were, in a mist for a few moments after this act.\r\nThus, amaurosis was predicted in a public girl, whose case is mentioned\r\nby Hoffmann, and whose sight was obscured whenever she had connexion\r\nwith men. She finally became blind. (_De morbis ex nim. ven._, § 26.)\r\nThe sight is rarely lost suddenly: it commonly fades away gradually;\r\nand the onanist, if he can understand this warning, may, by abandoning\r\nhis bad habits in time, preserve the vigor he still possesses; and,\r\nsometimes, even may recover what he has lost.\r\n\r\nThe weakness and loss of sight, and the other affections of the eye\r\nalready mentioned, are not the only ones which may arise from excessive\r\nonanism or coition: the muscles of the eye may also be affected. Lorry\r\nwas, we believe, the first to notice this fact. “The eyes,” says he,\r\n“are affected with convulsive and spasmodic motions, after venereal\r\nexcesses, rather than with blindness.” He states, that strabismus\r\nmay be caused by onanism. We have before stated the case of a young\r\nman, whose eyes were affected with violent spasms at the moment of a\r\ndischarge of semen. Demours has observed similar facts. “Masturbation,”\r\nsays he, “affects the optic nerves, and also acts on the motor nerves\r\nof the eye.” He admits that he can see no reason for this. The same\r\nauthor mentions venereal excesses among the different causes of partial\r\nparalysis of the muscles of the eye.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the wandering pains, which frequently affect\r\nonanists; we have also alluded to those which depend on an affection of\r\nthe spinal marrow. We have reason to think, from our own observations,\r\nand the statements particularly of English authors, that the number of\r\npains dependent on an affection of the spinal marrow is much larger\r\nthan is generally thought: we think, that most of the pains termed\r\nrheumatic, particularly those affecting the trunk and the limbs, are\r\nneuralgic; and that most of these neuralgias proceed from an irritation\r\nof the medulla or its membranes. We do not say that the spinal cord\r\nis always affected then, as in those cases of myelitis which attend\r\nparalysis and death: we think that it is affected in some manner;\r\nand that these pains, which are commonly so severe, and frequently\r\nso general--sometimes attended with tumefaction, but more frequently\r\nwithout it--which are felt in the course of these nerves, are the usual\r\nconsequences of this affection. Hence, it is not surprising, that the\r\nact of venery, which excites the nervous system so much--which has so\r\nmarked an action on the spinal marrow, has frequently predisposed to\r\nneuralgic or rheumatic pains, and has directly caused or increased this\r\nkind of pains. It is well ascertained, and many authors--particularly\r\nHoffmann--have remarked, that those who indulge in onanism, during\r\nyouth, are more subject to these pains than others. The act of venery,\r\neven when indulged in to a moderate extent, generally increases their\r\nviolence. I have often seen attacks of neuralgia supervene immediately\r\nafter coition. It was an affection of this kind which was felt by the\r\nonanist who wrote to Tissot, that he felt in his face a pain similar to\r\nthat caused by applying a great number of pins.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who have braved the usual causes of rheumatism with\r\nimpunity, not unfrequently become vulnerable to these causes after\r\nvenereal excesses. M. Villeneuve relates the case of a stonecutter,\r\nwho had long been exposed to changes of weather without inconvenience,\r\nand who was violently attacked with rheumatism after unusual venereal\r\nexcesses. He also mentions the case of a groom, who had long slept in\r\na damp and narrow stable without suffering, but who was attacked with\r\nrheumatism the winter after his marriage. Saucerotte has seen a similar\r\ncase: it was that of a man who had constantly braved the changes of\r\nweather, and who was affected with rheumatism after indulging in\r\nwomen and wine. The same author has established, in the memoir where\r\nthis fact was reported, that muscular rheumatism is only a variety of\r\nneuralgia. Among the proofs which he gives of it, he states that many\r\nauthors, as Barthez, Scudamore, Chaussier, Olivier, and Ferrus, have\r\nplaced venereal excesses among the causes of neuralgias and those of\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nMost authors have considered these excesses as one of the predisposing\r\ncauses of gout. Hippocrates, probably, entertained the same idea, if we\r\nmay judge from these two aphorisms:--“_Eunuchi neque podagra laborant,\r\nneque caluescunt. Puer podagra non tentatur ante venereorum usum._”\r\nSydenham also regarded excessive indulgence in venereal pleasures as\r\ntending to produce gout. Guilbert remarks, that even hereditary gout\r\nis neither a disease of infancy nor of youth: he admits, however, that\r\nvenereal excesses may produce it before the time it generally appears.\r\nRoche exclaims against this opinion: he thinks that venereal excesses\r\ncan only cause attacks of gout. He says--\r\n\r\n“What influence have masturbation and venereal excesses in producing\r\ngout? According to men of the world, and even to some physicians, they\r\nare the most fruitful source of this infirmity: and yet on what facts\r\ndoes this opinion rest? On this, that several gouty people have been\r\ngreat libertines in their youth. But how many chaste persons, and how\r\nmany prelates, too, are attacked by this cruel disease? On the other\r\nhand, are there not as many, and even more libertines among the poor,\r\nthan among the rich? and yet, in general, they are not attacked by the\r\ngout. Finally, the shameful vice of onanism is observed most frequently\r\namong the young; and we have already said that gout is a disease of\r\nmanhood and old age. Hence, it is wrong to attribute to this order of\r\ncauses a part of the influence which it has not, and cannot have, in\r\nproducing gout. Here, doubtless, has been committed the error which\r\nhas been several times pointed out: attacks of gout have frequently\r\nbeen known to supervene after venereal excesses or masturbation; and\r\nit has been concluded that these causes concur powerfully in producing\r\nthe disease itself. Good living and gormandizing are, we repeat, the\r\nreal--the only sources of gout: sobriety, frugality, are the best\r\npreservatives from it.”\r\n\r\nThis last phrase shows clearly the origin of Roche’s opinion. It is\r\nevident that he denies the influence attributed to venereal excesses,\r\nin the production of gout, only to sustain a favorite theory. Roche\r\ncertainly never would have said, that there is more libertinism in the\r\nlower than in the higher walks of life, if he had not been preoccupied\r\nwith the desire of proving that good living is the cause of gout,\r\nto the exclusion of every other cause. It may be asserted, that one\r\nmode of living predisposes to the gout more than another; and we will\r\nagree with every author, that this disease appears particularly in\r\nindividuals who are well fed; but we cannot admit, that the possible\r\naction of certain influences, as that of venereal excesses, should be\r\ndenied. Impressed, however, with the vast extent of the influence of\r\nvenereal excesses, and with the uncertainty of its limits, we prefer to\r\nallow, with all authors, that venereal excesses, like many other known\r\nand unknown causes, may predispose to gout. This opinion seems to be\r\nmore logical than that sustained by Roche with his usual ability.\r\n\r\nRoche, also, in accordance with other authors, regards venereal\r\nexcesses as injurious to those affected with gout. “The indulgence in\r\nvenereal pleasures,” says Barthez, “should seldom be permitted to those\r\naffected with gout; for they should abstain from whatever weakens or\r\nexhausts. Coste, who has written on gout, is much more formal. “A gouty\r\nperson,” says he, “should choose between living apart from his wife,\r\nand being cured of his disease; or caressing her, and rendering his\r\ndisease incurable. Whenever a gouty person sees a female,” he adds,\r\n“if young, a new root to his disease sprouts forth; and if he be old,\r\nhe drives a nail into his coffin.” This opinion differs from that of\r\nPietsch, who maintains that gout arises from the absorption of vitiated\r\nsemen, which is retained by continence in the seminal vesicles.\r\n\r\nCan venereal excesses cause hemorrhoidal affections? For want of facts\r\non this subject, we would remark, that these excesses _may_ contribute\r\nto develop these affections, and particularly the exacerbations to\r\nwhich they are subject. This was Montegre’s opinion: he admitted, that\r\nthe nervous debility which resulted from the abuse of the genital\r\norgans, generally favored the occurrence of fluxes, motions which occur\r\nmost frequently in people subject to hemorrhoids; and also, that in\r\nthose females who have hemorrhoidal tumors on the rectum or vagina, the\r\nabuse of coition may excite inflammation of these tumors. Montegre,\r\nhowever, thinks that excessive continence has a more detrimental effect\r\non those affected with hemorrhoids than the contrary. He thought that\r\nthe irritation which extreme continence causes in the seminal vesicles\r\nand adjacent parts, may excite a hemorrhoidal paroxysm: hence, he\r\nregards the act of venery as generally useful to persons affected with\r\nhemorrhoids, provided it is confined within certain limits. On this\r\nopinion, we would say, that if the irritation of the seminal passages\r\nmay extend to the adjacent passages, venereal excesses which produce\r\nthis irritation may also cause inflammation of the hemorrhoidal tumors\r\nmuch more frequently than continence. This is the opinion of Begin,\r\nalso, who mentions, among the direct causes of hemorrhoids, “excesses\r\nin venereal pleasures--excesses which are always attended with a state\r\nof orgasm and vascular fulness in the genital system, and in all the\r\nparts connected with it; and particularly in the lower region of the\r\nrectum, which receives the same vessels in the neck of the bladder,\r\nthe prostate gland, and the seminal vesicles, in the male, and in the\r\nuterus and vagina in the female.”\r\n\r\nWe may believe, from the enervating action of masturbation, that the\r\ndevelopment of scrofula may be excited or favored in those young\r\npatients who are addicted to it. Few proofs of this, however, are found\r\nin authors; and it is rare to find records of scrofulous symptoms in\r\nthe histories of those onanists which have been published. It, however,\r\nwould be absurd to conclude, from this silence, that the coincidence\r\nof these symptoms and the ordinary effects of onanism never occur, or\r\nthat this habit cannot call into action a disposition to disease. But\r\nwe must admit, that if masturbation be an active cause of this disease,\r\nthis fact would have been noted more frequently.\r\n\r\nFurther: Certain circumstances seem to indicate, that onanism must be\r\nbut little favorable to the development of scrofula. First, onanism\r\nrenders the limbs thinner, dries them, then deprives them of those\r\nwhite fluids with which the flesh of scrofulous persons is generally\r\ninfiltrated. Next, since in these latter the sensibility is as it\r\nwere blunted, and the susceptibility is slight, onanism tends to\r\nexcite them. Besides, one of the most common effects of the action of\r\nthe genital organs, at puberty, is the disappearance of scrofulous\r\nengorgements and other symptoms, if they exist. Sometimes, the normal\r\ndevelopment of the genital apparatus excites in those who have arrived\r\nat puberty the swelling of the lymphatic ganglions of the neck, axillæ,\r\nand particularly of the groins: but in this case, these ganglions\r\nare painful, and present a kind of inflammatory state, analogous to\r\nthat which is attempted to be produced when they are affected with\r\nscrofulous engorgements. Cabanis has well described what then takes\r\nplace:--“From the time,” says he, “that the evolution of the genital\r\norgans commences, there is a general motion in the whole lymphatic\r\napparatus; the glands of the groins, the mammæ, those of the axillæ,\r\nand neck, swell: they often become painful. It is not only in girls\r\nthat the mammæ swell; in young men, I have frequently seen them form\r\ntumors, which seemed inflammatory: they have often been considered as\r\nsuch by ignorant quacks. This symptom generally causes uneasiness in\r\nthose who experience it: but this depends not so much on the pain,\r\n(which sometimes impedes the free motions of the body,) as on the\r\ninfluence of this new action--the commotion caused in the imagination\r\nby the new system.” This state of the lymphatic system would be, as is\r\nseen, rather antithetic, than analogous to what is seen in scrofulous\r\npatients. Farther: we have only to compare the eunuch with him who\r\nhas vigorously passed through puberty, to see that the action of\r\nthe genital organs is not adapted to favor the development of this\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe act of venery often causes, also, ganglionary swellings; but they\r\ndo not resemble scrofulous engorgements, more than those which arise\r\nfrom the influence of puberty. “The first essay of venereal pleasures,”\r\nsays Cabanis, “is often necessary to complete the development of the\r\ngenital organs: thus, the general swelling of all the parts where the\r\nglands are situated, especially of the bosom, of the anterior face\r\nof the neck, is often the consequence of this great commotion. The\r\ncharacters which manifest this swelling are much more remarkable in\r\nfemales; hence, perhaps, the old physicians, and even some moderns,\r\nhave stated the sudden swelling of the neck in young girls as a sign of\r\ndefloration. But it is wrong to consider this as a general and certain\r\nsign: it is certainly not one.” If the act of venery can produce such\r\nan excitement in the lymphatic system, it ought to be still more\r\nmanifest when a part of this system is already inflamed. This is\r\nconfirmed by a fact stated by Lordat, in the bulletin of the scientific\r\nsociety of Montpelier. It relates to a young woman, in whom the jugular\r\nglands being swelled, a few days after her marriage, increased or\r\ndiminished in size, according as she yielded to her husband’s embraces\r\nor not. Thus, then, if we consider the genital organs, either during\r\nthe acute period of their development, or when the act of venery is\r\nindulged in, we see that they extend their action to the lymphatic\r\napparatus, as they do to the other systems; but in a manner which seems\r\nthe reverse of that reputed to favor the production of scrofula.\r\n\r\nSymptoms, however, analogous to those caused by scrofula, have been\r\nknown to occur where there is evidence of venereal abuses. Two cases,\r\nwhich we have already quoted from M. Dalandeterie, are instances of\r\nthis. The first relates to a young man, twenty-four years old, whose\r\nhealth, before he was addicted to masturbation, had been good; and\r\nwhose parents, so far as could be ascertained, had never been diseased\r\nwith scrofula, and had never presented any disposition to the disease.\r\nFirst, he was affected with numbness in the little finger of the\r\nright hand, and the ring-finger of the left hand; the articulations\r\nswelled, and formed in these parts tumors, which were regarded as\r\nscrofulous, and which were soon followed by ulceration and caries. The\r\npatient experienced no pain; and only felt an intolerable itching. The\r\nlymphatic ganglions of the groin and axillæ were permanently swelled;\r\nand the bodies of several vertebræ became, as we have seen, affected\r\nwith caries.\r\n\r\nThe other patient, who was forty-five years old, presented an advanced\r\ncase of myelitis, and caries of the vertebræ, when there formed, at the\r\nlower part of the sternum, a hard and indolent tumor, which soon became\r\napparently a scrofulous ulcer. The pus from this ulcer was ichorous,\r\nand the edges were of a violet red, swelled and hard; and the soft\r\nparts adhered to the subjacent bones. The lymphatic ganglions of the\r\nneck swelled for some time, but they then returned to their natural\r\nstate. M. Dalandeterie adds, that these two cases have been selected\r\nfrom many other similar or analogous facts: hence, he considers caries\r\nof the vertebræ as having then been the consequence of a scrofulous\r\nprinciple, which was developed by onanism.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we carefully analyze these facts, we shall find that they\r\ndo not indicate a scrofulous disease, the development of which was\r\nbut slightly favored by the age of the patients, as a _tubercular_\r\naffection--that is, a disease which might be developed at every period\r\nof life. We think that tubercles were developed, in the phalanges,\r\nin the first case; and in the sternum, in the second; that these\r\ntubercles softened, and suppurated; and thus were formed the apparent\r\nscrofulous ulcers presented by these individuals. Probably, a similar\r\ncircumstance occurs in the vertebræ, the bodies of which are destroyed;\r\nfor distinguished observers, especially Delpech, have regarded Pott’s\r\ndisease as a tubercular affection of the body of these bones. The cases\r\nof Dalandeterie would prove only that onanism favors the development of\r\ntubercles. Unfortunately, they are not the only cases, as we shall see,\r\nwhich establish this fact.\r\n\r\nConsumption, or phthisis tubercularis, is, in fact, one of the diseases\r\ncaused most frequently by onanism. The act of venery--that power which\r\nhas so much influence on the internal life of the tissues, and on the\r\nrespiratory organs, and which, to use Rullier’s expression, seems\r\nto agitate the lungs--is commenced in most onanists exactly at that\r\nage when the chest enlarges in every direction, and which phthisis\r\nseems to prefer. “How many young persons,” says Portal, in his work\r\non phthisis pulmonalis, “have been victims to their unhappy passion?\r\nPhysicians find those every day, who remain imbecile, or who are so\r\nenervated, physically and morally, that they barely drag along a\r\nmiserable existence: others die with marasmus; and many with phthisis\r\npulmonalis.” In another work, the same author relates the case of a\r\nyoung person, seventeen years old, who was addicted to masturbation,\r\nand who fell a victim to this disease. This young person, who had\r\nbecame much deformed, was affected with raising of blood, and soon\r\ndied of phthisis. “It results from numerous well ascertained facts,”\r\nsay Fournier and Begin, “that those persons who indulge in onanism are\r\ngenerally remarkable for the imperfect development of their thorax, and\r\nfor the promptitude with which the least exercise renders respiration\r\ndifficult and hurried. Almost all these individuals contract chronic\r\ncatarrhs, or more serious affections of the pulmonary organs; and\r\nfinally perish, in a complete state of phthisis.” Broussais, also,\r\nplaces among the causes of phthisis pulmonalis, “erotic spasms, no\r\nmatter in what manner they are excited.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen this affection, more frequently than any other, resulting\r\nfrom onanism. Among other instances, we would mention that of a young\r\nman, who died in 1833. This young man sustained himself so well in\r\npublic debate, that he was placed, at the expense of government, in a\r\npublic school. He was then sixteen years old; and his health, which had\r\npreviously been good, now failed. He became pale, languished, and grew\r\nthin; and this, too, although his appetite was keen, and his digestion\r\nexcellent. Having my suspicions, and having communicated them to the\r\npatient, and also to other persons who could enlighten me, we were led\r\nto believe, from the answers made to me, that the too rapid growth of\r\nthe body was the only cause of the state presented by the patient;\r\nand his state varied so little from that of health, that the young\r\nman assured me that he was very well. I therefore simply directed him\r\nto take more exercise, and to be more free in his diet. His loss of\r\nflesh, however, and paleness continuing, his parents felt anxious about\r\nhim. I examined his organs separately: I could find none presenting\r\nany marks of disease, or which could explain the general state of the\r\npatient. My first suspicions then returned; but on questioning him, the\r\nsame answers were given. The patient, who had already seen an instance\r\nof the bad effects of onanism, in the person of his younger brother,\r\nseemed deeply impressed with the danger of his habit. He, however,\r\ncontinued to lose strength. One day, after taking more violent exercise\r\nthan usual, he fainted away. At the same time, a dry cough supervened,\r\nto which the patient at first did not attend. This was the first\r\nsymptom indicating an affection of any particular organ. This cough\r\nsoon became more frequent; and, by means of auscultation, we found that\r\nthe respiration, at the summit of one of the lungs, was imperfect.\r\nAt this time, the patient avowed to his father his deplorable habit.\r\nThis had been contracted at school; it had been indulged in for two\r\nyears; and of late, much more frequently than before. His danger was\r\nfully pointed out to him; parents, friends, physicians, all conjured\r\nhim to abandon this secret vice. Treatises on onanism were placed in\r\nhis hands; and every attempt was made to arouse in him the feeling\r\nof self-preservation. He was terrified; but the power of the habit\r\nwas so great, that he did not leave it off till consumption had\r\nprogressed very far. Deep abscesses successively formed in his lungs;\r\nthe expectoration soon became purulent and excessive. Night sweats and\r\ndiarrhœa followed; and the patient died in a terrible state of marasmus\r\nand exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, we prescribed for a young man, whose career was much more\r\nrapid. He had always enjoyed excellent health; and his parents\r\nexhibited no marks of consumption. Having married a very pretty widow,\r\nhe indulged himself with her very freely at night, while during the\r\nday both were assiduously engaged. The female was seven or eight years\r\nolder than her husband, and did not suffer much. He, however, soon\r\nbecame affected with cough, attended with bloody expectoration. When\r\nconsulted, we informed the patient of his danger, unless he changed\r\nhis mode of living. Our advice was not followed; and shortly after,\r\nhemorrhage from the lungs supervened so abundantly and obstinately,\r\nthat notwithstanding the most active treatment, he died in eight days.\r\n\r\nThe young man, too, mentioned by Tissot, was also doubtless affected\r\nwith phthisis. “He came to Montpelier to pursue his studies; but was\r\naffected with phthisis, from excessive onanism: and I remember that his\r\ncough was so hard and constant, that all those who were near him were\r\nincommoded by it. He was frequently bled; doubtless, with a view to his\r\nrelief. On consultation, he was ordered to go home, and take turtle\r\nsoup; and two hours after, he died.”\r\n\r\nIt is with phthisis, as with most of the other diseases, caused\r\nby masturbation. This habit causes disease, by cherishing and by\r\ncultivating special dispositions. Thus, the onanist born of consumptive\r\nparents, whose chest is narrow, with a long neck and thin limbs,\r\nand who presents symptoms of scrofula, is more liable to be affected\r\nwith phthisis or consumption. This was the case with a young man, as\r\nmentioned by Rozier. This patient was evidently scrofulous, and many\r\nmembers of his family had been affected with the disease. He remained,\r\nhowever, pretty well until he was eighteen years old, when, in\r\nconsequence of a contusion in one of his legs, he became affected with\r\nan ulcer, which was a long time healing. After it was cured, however,\r\nhe remained in good health, and was lively, animated, and intelligent;\r\nbut when twenty-five years old, he commenced indulging in onanism.\r\nHe soon felt oppression at the chest, and cough; and although the\r\naffection of his chest increased, and he was aware of the dangers of\r\nonanism, he continued to indulge. Many physicians were consulted; but\r\nhe did not mention his bad habit. The affection of the lungs continued;\r\nhis sleep was interrupted; hectic fever supervened; his cheeks were\r\ntinged with an unnatural color; and his expectoration was grayish\r\nand purulent. The patient then decided on avowing his habit. Rozier\r\nattempted, in the most touching and persuasive manner, to induce him\r\nto abandon it; but in vain. Consumption continued to progress; and he\r\nwas soon unable to talk, to move, or to make the least motion, without\r\ndanger of suffocation. After remaining in this horrid state three\r\nyears, the patient died.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked several times, that the respiration in\r\nonanists is frequently affected. Their breath is often short; they\r\npant on the slightest exercise; are subject to stifling, &c. These\r\nsymptoms, the existence of which cannot always be explained by that\r\nof any organic alteration in the heart or lungs, finally assume, in\r\nsome individuals, the characters attributed to _nervous asthma_.\r\nThe authors who have written on this subject, have all classed\r\nvenereal excesses among its most frequent causes. “Individuals of a\r\nnervous temperament,” says M. Ferrus, “seem most particularly liable\r\nto it. But the influence of certain bad habits--as masturbation,\r\nthe abuse of venereal pleasures by young persons, excesses of the\r\ntable in old men, &c.--contribute, as powerfully as individual\r\npredispositions, to produce this disease.” Jolly remarks, in nearly\r\nsimilar language:--“Venereal excesses and masturbation,” says this\r\ndistinguished physician, “have appeared in some cases to produce\r\nasthma. And if some authors think that too much importance is attached\r\nto this cause, they may readily appreciate its value by observing the\r\neffects of the venereal orgasm on the pulmonary circulation.” Daily\r\nobservation proves that persons affected with asthma have generally\r\nused the goods of this life freely. To admit that venereal excesses\r\noften prepare for or excite an attack of asthma, we have only to regard\r\nan attack of asthma, whether excited or not by an organic lesion, as\r\nconsisting in a spasm of the glottis; or, as Reisessen and Cruvelhier\r\nthink, of the ramifications of the bronchi.\r\n\r\nOur remarks on asthma may apply to diseases of the heart and large\r\nvessels. The frequent repetitions of an act which render the emotions\r\nso powerful, frequent, and tumultuous, has often produced or increased\r\naneurismatic dilatations of this organ; the thickening of its parietes,\r\nor other diseases, of the parenchyma, or of the vessels which leave\r\nit and go to it. Thus, the abuse of onanism, and of the pleasures of\r\nlove, holds a high place on the list of causes of this affection.\r\nWe have seen dilatations of the left ventricle of the heart, which\r\nevidently arose from this cause. “In some cases,” says Fournier and\r\nBegin, “palpitations, and even considerable lesions of the heart and\r\nlarge vessels, could have no other cause, in patients whose vigorous\r\nconstitutions have long resisted the destructive practice of onanism,\r\nand who, notwithstanding their excesses, have attained an advanced\r\nage.” This last remark is particularly just. These diseases are by no\r\nmeans so immediately dangerous as is generally believed. The principal\r\nsymptoms of diseases of the heart may exist, although this organ may\r\nnot be materially altered. A remarkable instance of this may be seen\r\nin one of the cases already mentioned. The patient experienced for\r\na long time difficulty of breathing; which increased on walking, and\r\nespecially on going up stairs. These symptoms were so marked, that on\r\nentering the hospital, he exhibited all the symptoms of a hypertrophy\r\nof the left cavities of the heart. Four months after his entrance into\r\nthe hospital, the patient died of the consequences of myelitis; and on\r\nopening the body, the heart was found perfectly healthy, of its normal\r\nsize, and presented nothing unusual in the extent of its cavities, or\r\nin the thickness of their parietes.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases of the heart which may be caused by venereal\r\nexcesses, there is one in particular mentioned by Blaud. He thinks\r\nthat too frequent coition predisposes to _polypi of the heart_. He\r\nmaintains, that the act produces its effects, either by weakening the\r\nmotive powers of this organ, which they over-excite momentarily; or\r\nby causing too great an accumulation, and consequently a congestion\r\nof blood, in the cardiac cavities. This last fact seemed to him to\r\nbe proved, by the oppression, the congestion in the head, and the\r\npalpitations, which attend coition.\r\n\r\nIf venereal excesses may cause diseases of the heart, they may increase\r\nthose which exist. They may also, by causing the rupture of an\r\naneurism, produce instant death. But having already treated of these\r\neffects, we shall not return to the subject.\r\n\r\nRachitis, and particularly alterations in the height, have been named\r\nby many authors among the ordinary effects of premature indulgences.\r\nWe have already given, from Portal, the remarkable case of a young\r\ngirl, who, indulging in excesses of onanism, became humpbacked, and\r\nthen consumptive. In six months, the curve of the vertebral column\r\nprogressed rapidly; the chest was depressed at the lower part of the\r\nsternum; there was a deep hollow in the epigastric region, while the\r\nabdomen was prominent. The same author has observed other similar\r\ncases. “I have seen,” says he, “four or five of these unfortunate\r\ncreatures, from fifteen to eighteen years old, in whom the back was\r\nvery convex, and the abdomen seemed pressed into the chest; the\r\nextremities of the long bones, particularly those which form the elbows\r\nand knees, were very much enlarged; the legs were thrown out, and\r\ntheir muscles were scarcely developed; their eyes were sunken; their\r\ncountenances pale and white; and their voices acute. Any one, to judge\r\nof their ages by their looks, would think that they were not more than\r\ntwelve years old. They were extremely weak, physically and morally,\r\nand became imbecile long before they died.” Dr. Richard, cited by\r\nPetit, has also seen considerable deformity of the ribs, resulting from\r\nonanism. Tissot placed this habit first among the causes of rachitis.\r\nM. Lonyer Villermey, also, regards onanism and involuntary pollutions\r\nas an active source of deviations in height. On the other hand, Dr.\r\nLaguerre, a gentleman who has attended to rachitic persons a good deal,\r\ntells us that the habit has been observed by him only once, as a cause\r\nof spinal deformity.\r\n\r\nIt has also been advanced, that premature enjoyment may arrest the\r\ngrowth of the body, and consequently prevent it from attaining its\r\nnormal height. We do not deny the possibility of such a result. We have\r\nseen many onanists, however, grow very rapidly, notwithstanding their\r\nexcesses, and all the symptoms of extensive alteration. It follows,\r\nalso, from the researches of Villermé and Quetelet, that the mean\r\nheight of man is generally greater in the city than in the country; and\r\nyet, in the former, masturbation is more frequent. We can see, too, by\r\ncomparing the increase in weight to that in length, during the first\r\ntwenty years, that the development of the genital organs exercises\r\nmuch more influence on the mass of the body, than on its height: thus,\r\nbetween the ages of four and fifteen years--that is, during the period\r\nof puberty--the annual increase of weight is quadruple of what it was\r\nin preceding years. Do not these reasons authorize us to think, that if\r\npremature excesses have any influence on the height of man, this action\r\nis less than is generally imagined?\r\n\r\nBesides rachitis, caries, and tubercles, which have been mentioned,\r\nare the bones ever affected with any other disease, in consequence\r\nof venereal indulgences? The only case in point is that already\r\nmentioned,(p. 85) as reported by Serrurier, of a man who was reduced\r\nto a complete state of marasmus, in consequence of venereal excesses\r\nand nocturnal pollutions. In this man’s case, a remarkable circumstance\r\noccurred. Having attempted, a few days before death, to rest himself\r\nfrom the fatigues of the bed, by spending a few hours in the easy\r\nchair, he fractured the bone of his right thigh at its centre, merely\r\nby attempting to cross the right thigh on the left. Might not this\r\ndisease, which is very rare, and is termed friability of the bones, be\r\nalso caused by the excesses we have mentioned?\r\n\r\nThese excesses, if accompanied by those of the table, or if indulged\r\nin under unfavorable circumstances, may be followed by acute, as\r\nwell as by chronic affections, and particularly by fevers of a bad\r\ncharacter. This result of excessive enjoyments is frequent; and cases\r\nof it have been seen by almost every physician. It was known to the\r\nancients. Hippocrates gives the history of a young man of Melibœa, who,\r\nafter indulging in women and wine, was attacked with all the symptoms\r\nof typhus fever. Bartholin knew a person, recently married, who was\r\nattacked, after conjugal excesses, with an acute fever, attended with\r\ngreat depression, sinking, nausea, immoderate thirst, &c. This patient\r\nwas cured by rest and tonics. Hoffmann, who states this case, also\r\nmentions that of a man, who never indulged in venereal excesses without\r\nbeing attacked with fever, which continued several days. Tissot, in\r\n1761 and 1762, knew two very healthy, strong, and vigorous young men,\r\nwho were attacked, one the day after, and the other the second night\r\nof their marriage, with a very violent fever, preceded by no chill,\r\npulse quick and hard, wakefulness, many slight convulsive motions, very\r\ngreat inquietude, and dry skin. The appearance of the second was very\r\nmuch altered, and he was troubled with dysuria. He first thought that\r\nan intemperate use of wine was in part the procuring part of these\r\nsymptoms; but I was of a different opinion in regard to the second.\r\nThey were cured at the end of two days. This circumstance added to the\r\ncharacter of the disease, leaves no doubt of the cause.\r\n\r\nSauvages admits, after Dellon, that a typhus of exhausted persons\r\nexists. The Portuguese term patients affected with this malady,\r\n_esfalfados_. The exhaustion caused by immoderate indulgence in\r\nvenereal pleasures, says this author, is very common among the\r\nIndians. It is a continued fever, in which the pulse is sometimes full\r\nand strong, sometimes weak, and almost imperceptible. The urine is\r\nsometimes very red, but transparent; the skin is hot and dry; and there\r\nis watchfulness, nausea, and violent thirst.\r\n\r\nFarther: All authors who have written on the diseases of warm climates,\r\nhave mentioned the too frequent repetition of the act of venery among\r\nthe causes of these typhus affections, which have been termed _febris\r\nardens_, _causus_, _yellow fever_, &c. In temperate climates, adynamic\r\nataxic fevers, &c., and very severe acute diseases, have often been\r\nknown to occur from excesses in venery, or from masturbation.\r\n\r\nIf _satyriasis_ and _nymphomania_ have been regarded as rare diseases,\r\nit is only because the meaning of these terms has been too confined\r\nto embrace numerous cases which, however, have the greatest analogy\r\nwith those diseases to which these terms are applied. Generally, these\r\npersons are considered as affected with satyriasis and nymphomania,\r\nwho are irresistibly impelled to coition, and resort, to satisfy\r\ntheir desires, to the most indecent actions, and to the most direct\r\nprovocations. Thus defined, these diseases are rare; and most\r\npractitioners have never seen them. But if satyriasis and nymphomania\r\nbe regarded as an unusual state of heat, by which one is led to desire\r\nand to practise not only coition, but the act of venery in any mode,\r\nthen the scene enlarges, and these affections deserve to be placed\r\namong those which are observed most frequently.\r\n\r\nWe shall adopt the latter sense. In our view, male and female onanists\r\nare affected with satyriasis and nymphomania, as much as those to whom\r\nthese terms are generally applied. In both, the sense of venery,\r\nexisting to an unusual extent, affects the mind, and incites to\r\ndangerous actions, repugnant both to modesty and reason. Onanists do\r\nnot, like other persons affected with satyriasis, expose their persons,\r\nand solicit with voice and gesture those of the other sex: their\r\nderanged and delirious imaginations pursue another course. What need\r\nhave they of the other sex? Their inclinations lead them to solitary\r\nindulgence. Their thoughts and actions, however, are not less vile than\r\nthose of others affected with satyriasis; but they are indulged in\r\nsecret. Hence, between the satyriasis of books and that of onanists,\r\nthere is only a difference of form: the foundation is the same. Admit,\r\nhowever, that it be desirable to distinguish this satyriasis from the\r\nformer, and to give it a special name; is it not better to consider\r\nthem only as two varieties of the same affection, one of which impels\r\nto onanism, the other to coition?\r\n\r\nThe degree of onanistic satyriasis and of nymphomania depends on the\r\npower the venereal sense has over the will. These affections do not\r\nexist in those with whom it is optional whether they shall indulge in\r\nonanism or not, nor in those who can refrain from coition. Thus, then,\r\na person may masturbate, without being affected with satyriasis. This\r\nis the case, when the sentiment of self-preservation is sufficiently\r\nstrong to resist desires, when the persons yield readily to reprimands\r\nand punishments. Satyriasis may be considered as existing to some\r\nextent in the onanist, if he cannot refrain. This was the case with a\r\nyoung man, whose history is given by Begin and Fournier. From early\r\npuberty, he was addicted to masturbation; and when eighteen years\r\nold, he presented some of the bad effects of this habit. This young\r\nman was endowed with a brilliant mind: but, although well educated,\r\nand although he well knew the dangers of his habit, yet he could not\r\nrefrain. His good resolutions were formed only to be broken. He died.\r\n\r\nIn a young woman whom we attended, the struggle with her passions\r\nterminated more favorably. It was not the desire of preserving her\r\nlife, which induced her to leave off her bad habits; but the wish of\r\nconforming to the will of her father. Her constitution was already\r\nconsiderably affected, when the cause of it was discovered. The father\r\nof this young girl told her how much pain and shame her bad habit\r\ncaused him, and requested her to abstain from it. She was extremely\r\nmild and docile, and made every effort to please and obey him. It was\r\nin vain: but whenever she was inclined to masturbate, the fault was\r\nconfessed as soon as committed. Coercive measures were finally resolved\r\nupon. The patient not only consented to have her hands tied every\r\nnight, but requested it, and even stated the manner in which she might\r\nbe most effectually prevented from abusing herself. The venereal sense\r\ngradually became subdued, and confined within the proper limits. And\r\nthus, this habit--or, rather, the nymphomania, which was the result,\r\nand also the cause of it--was cured.\r\n\r\nSatyriasis and nymphomania, arising from onanism, are most intense,\r\nwhen the persons affected with it can no longer conceal their feelings,\r\nbut indulge openly in vile manœuvres. We have already mentioned some\r\nremarkable instances of this state. The following may serve as the type\r\nof the greatest degree of nymphomania. The patient was a little girl\r\nless than three years old, who indulged freely in onanism. Neither\r\ncaresses, entreaties, threats, nor punishments, could correct her.\r\nThe child grew, however. But at the sight of any pleasant object, she\r\nabandoned herself to her manœuvres. At the period of the crisis, she\r\nseemed almost entirely to have lost her sight and hearing. Threats\r\nand punishments finally restrained her, while in the presence of her\r\nparents; but when alone, she still continued her bad habits. This\r\nstate resisted all remedies. When married, the legitimate sources of\r\nenjoyment took the place of the passionate indulgences to which she had\r\nbeen accustomed from infancy. She finally became pregnant, and died in\r\nlabor. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._; vol. xxxvi., p. 566.)\r\n\r\nOnanism is not only a direct cause of satyriasis and of nymphomania;\r\nit may leave in the genital organs a certain disposition, which, if\r\ncherished, may degenerate into one of these affections. The following\r\ncase, published by Duprest-Rony, seems to us to be an instance of\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\nA young man, twenty years old, of a strong and almost athletic frame,\r\nbut who had been enfeebled by onanism, abandoned himself, from the age\r\nof fifteen to eighteen years, to this destructive habit. He indulged\r\nin this habit even while in the bath, and sometimes to the extent of\r\nfifteen times in a day. His constitution was enfeebled; his mind was\r\naffected; his memory impaired. In accordance with the advice of some\r\nprudent people, this young man renounced this fatal habit. During the\r\nnext two years, he was perfectly continent. His constitution resumed\r\nits vigor; his memory and other mental faculties were restored. His\r\nparents now placed him with a merchant. He entered upon his new\r\noccupations with zeal and activity; but receiving marks of attachment\r\nfrom the merchant and his wife daily, he imagined that she was in love\r\nwith him. On his side, the passion was returned. Actuated by the fear\r\nof violating the duties of gratitude, and the desire of possessing this\r\nlady, who was neither young nor pretty, his situation daily became\r\nmore embarrassing. Whenever she looked at him, erections took place,\r\nand there was a discharge of semen. During the night, he had frequent\r\npollutions. His faculties now became deranged: this derangement\r\nsupervened after reading the Phedra of Racine. He identified himself so\r\nclosely with the characters of this piece, that he supposed himself to\r\nbe Hippolyte, and considered his mistress to be Phedra, and her husband\r\nas Theseus. More amorous than Hippolyte, and no less virtuous, he threw\r\nhimself one day at the feet of Theseus, and said, “Theseus! the crime\r\nis not yet consummated--your wife is not yet guilty. I have hitherto\r\nresisted her prayers--her tears: but I am no longer master of myself;\r\nand if she is not removed from my presence, I must yield.” Great was\r\nthe astonishment of the supposed Theseus. He resolved to send the\r\nyoung man away. This cured the delirium: but the erections and seminal\r\nemissions continued. The stomach and intestinal tube became inert. The\r\npatient’s appetite was good; but as soon as he ate food, pains occurred\r\nin the epigastric region, and uneasiness in the rest of the body. The\r\ndisease finally yielded to the combined use of antispasmodics and\r\ntonics. And now, this young man, who has been married for five or six\r\nyears, enjoys fine health. (_Diss. sur le Satyriasis._ Paris, an xii.)\r\n\r\nInstead of the disposition just mentioned, masturbation may leave in\r\nthe genital organs an irritability of a different kind, the results of\r\nwhich are not less disagreeable. A case of this presented itself in a\r\nyoung female, whom we attended. While at board, she indulged freely in\r\nonanism. She was married when seventeen years old; and then expected\r\nlegally to enjoy what had seemed to her the extreme of pleasure. She\r\nwas disappointed, however: marriage was only the source of uneasiness\r\nand pain. She was perfectly insensible to the caresses of her\r\nhusband--or, rather, in submitting to them, she experienced the most\r\ndisagreeable sensations. A painful state of spasms and convulsions then\r\naffected her, which continued several hours after the cause had ceased\r\nto act. We were called to her several times at night, to relieve this\r\nstate, which caused great anxiety. This lady’s susceptibility, also,\r\nwas very great; and she constantly complained of some of the attendants\r\nof hysteria. She presented every appearance of a lymphatic temperament.\r\nDuring her youth, too, she had been affected with symptoms of scrofula,\r\nfrom which even now she is not entirely free, although twenty-two years\r\nold. Do not these circumstances, not generally coexistent with extreme\r\nsensibility, prove, that the extreme irritability of the uterine system\r\nis to be ascribed to her self-abuse?\r\n\r\nPriapism, which signifies permanent erection of the penis, without\r\npleasure, and even in some cases with pain, sometimes follows\r\nindiscretions. This has been seen particularly in young children, whose\r\ngenital organs have been excited: sometimes, too, it occurs in old\r\nmen. Cœlius Aurelian, (lib. iii., ch. 18,) relates, that an old man was\r\naffected with priapism for several months. The erection was firm, like\r\na horn, but not very painful. Finally, it yielded.\r\n\r\nThe genital organs may, from too much excitement, lose their\r\nsensibility, and waste. The manipulations, which at first were followed\r\nwith the desired result, become unable to excite the genital sense.\r\nThey may sometimes cause the erection of the penis, and even excite a\r\npainful or inconvenient priapism; but they cannot renew the fountain of\r\nenjoyment. The remembrance of past pleasures remains; and the onanist,\r\ndisturbed by their recollection, torments his blunted organs. Obtaining\r\nno satisfaction from the modes formerly employed, he now resorts to\r\nothers, which are sometimes dreadful. His hand which is now armed with\r\nsome instrument, no longer confines itself to the surface: the surface\r\nno longer feels. He now ventures inside, and shrinks from nothing. This\r\ncontinues until these dangerous resources fail, which happens, because\r\nthey also lose their effect, or because of the severe accidents with\r\nwhich they are sometimes attended.\r\n\r\nThe following case from Chopart, on diseases of the urinary passages,\r\nshows the almost incredible extent of insensibility which the penis may\r\nattain, or of delirium which may affect a man, who, having exhausted\r\nhis faculties by excesses, still remains a slave to his passions:--\r\n\r\n“A shepherd of Languedoc, Gabriel Gallien, about the age of fifteen,\r\nbecame addicted to onanism, and to such a degree, as to practise it\r\nseven or eight times in a day. Emission became at last so difficult,\r\nthat he would strive for an hour, and then discharge only a few drops\r\nof blood. At the age of six and twenty, his hand became insufficient:\r\nall he could do, was to keep the penis in a continual state of\r\npriapism. He then bethought himself of tickling the internal part of\r\nhis urethra, by means of a bit of wood, six inches long; and he would\r\nspend in that occupation several hours, while tending his flocks in\r\nthe solitude of the mountains. By a continuation of this titillation\r\nfor sixteen years, the canal of the urethra became hard, callous, and\r\ninsensible. The piece of wood then became as ineffectual as his hand.\r\nAt last, after much fruitless effort, G., one day in despair, drew\r\nfrom his pocket a blunt knife, and made an incision into his glands,\r\nalong the course of the urethra. This operation, which would have\r\nbeen painful to any body else, was, in him, attended with a sensation\r\nof pleasure, followed by a copious emission. He had recourse to his\r\nnew discovery every time his desire returned. When, after an incision\r\ninto the cavernous bodies, the blood flowed profusely, he stopped the\r\nhemorrhage, by applying around the penis a pretty tight ligature. At\r\nlast, after repeating the same process, perhaps a thousand times, he\r\nended in splitting his penis into two equal parts, from the orifice of\r\nthe penis to the stratum, very near to the symphisis pubis. When he\r\nhad got so far, unable to carry his incision any farther, and again\r\nreduced to new privations, he had recourse to a piece of wood, shorter\r\nthan the former: he introduced it into what remained of the urethra,\r\nand exciting at pleasure the extremities of the ejaculatory ducts, he\r\nprovoked easily the discharge of semen. He continued this about ten\r\nyears. After that long space of time, he one day introduced his bit\r\nof wood so carelessly, that it slipped from his fingers, and dropped\r\ninto the bladder. Excruciating pain and serious symptoms came on.\r\nThe patient was conveyed to the hospital at Narbonne. The surgeon,\r\nsurprised at the sight of two penes of ordinary size, both capable\r\nof erection, and in that stage diverging on both sides; and seeing,\r\nbesides, from the scars, and from the callous edges of the divisions,\r\nthat this conformation was not congenital from his birth; obliged\r\nthe patient to give him an account of his life, which he did, with\r\nthe details which have been related. This wretch was cut, as for the\r\nstone--recovered of the operation--but died three months after, of an\r\nabscess in the right side of the chest; his phthisical state having\r\nbeen evidently brought on by the practice of onanism, carried on\r\nnearly forty years.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the degree of degradation attending onanism, we do not\r\nthink it possible to adduce a second instance of such a mutilation.\r\nGallien’s unhappy idea of introducing a foreign body into the\r\nurethra, has often occurred to others, who had availed themselves,\r\nbut unsuccessfully, of the ordinary resources of masturbation. These\r\nunfortunate people have always been obliged to call in medical advice,\r\neither on account of the diseases caused by their dangerous manœuvres,\r\nor--much more frequently--by the symptoms to which they fall victims,\r\nthrough their carelessness. In fact, the implements used often escape\r\ninto the bladder; and then the acute suffering and fear of death oblige\r\nthem to reveal what they had formerly concealed, and to undergo an\r\noperation which is always painful, and which is not exempt from danger.\r\n\r\nWe will give a few instances of this kind of accident. An innkeeper,\r\nnear Saumur, was in the habit, like Gallien, of titillating the\r\nurethra, by introducing foreign bodies. He used an iron wire, seven\r\nor eight inches long, the end of which was crooked like a hook, to\r\nobtain, probably, more exquisite pleasure. One day, while indulging in\r\nthis singular manœuvre, he suddenly felt severe pain. The membraneous\r\nportion of the canal was ruptured. The unfortunate man made several\r\nattempts to withdraw the wire; but the hook, which had entered the soft\r\nparts, rendered it impossible. Overcome by suffering and shame, he\r\nwished to get rid of it; and with this view, he rounded the loose part\r\nof the wire into the form of a ring, proposing in this manner to pull\r\nupon it more firmly. He exercised this force till the ring was nearly\r\nbroken, but the iron was still in its place. He now expected death; but\r\nthe suffering was so great, that he was obliged to call a physician;\r\nand Dr. Fardeau, of Saumur, visited him.\r\n\r\nThe penis, and also the skin of the scrotum, was enormously tumefied:\r\nall the tissues which are inserted in the penis were also swelled,\r\nhot, and painful. The belly began to be puffy, and the urine was\r\nsuppressed; the face was red, and the eye filmy; the mind began to be\r\naffected; the pulse was hard, frequent, and corded. Dr. Fardeau grasped\r\nthe loose portion of the wire, pulled upon it slightly, and immediately\r\nfound that the other end was arrested by an immoveable obstacle. He\r\nthen examined the parts attentively; and found, to his astonishment,\r\nthat the hook was fixed in the inner edge of the ischiatic tuberosity.\r\nAn oblong incision was now made over this part, the hook seized, and\r\nthe wire was withdrawn through the perineum. The patient was relieved,\r\nand finally was completely restored. (_Lancette Fr._, October 13th,\r\n1831.)\r\n\r\nSaraillé has reported a similar case. The patient was fifty years old,\r\nand called this surgeon the 18th of October, 1813. He stated that a\r\nsailing needle, about four inches long, had unfortunately slipped into\r\nthe urethra; and the point had become fixed upward, near the root of\r\nthe penis. After suffering for eight days, during which the presence of\r\nthis body excited frequent erections, Lallemand operated, and extracted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMany individuals have been similarly affected. They have all imagined\r\nthat they could extract the instrument they used, when some unforeseen\r\naccident has deprived them of it. A young man, nineteen years old,\r\nwhose case is mentioned by Louis Senn, made use of the stalk of a\r\nplant, which he introduced into the urethra. It broke; and after much\r\nsuffering, the operation for stone was employed to extract it, and the\r\ncalculi which had formed around it. A similar circumstance happened\r\nto a man, thirty-eight years old, a patient of Rigal’s. This man\r\nintroduced into his urethra the stalk of a sword lily, (_gladiolus\r\ncommunis_.) This stalk broke, fell into the bladder, and after two\r\nmonths of pain and danger, the operation for stone was employed to\r\nextract it. It was two inches long; and was already covered with a\r\nsaline concretion, one or two lines thick. Bonnet, formerly surgeon at\r\nHotel Dieu, at Clermont, stated in his lectures, that a vine-dresser\r\nused a vine-stalk for this purpose. During an emission of semen, he\r\ndropped the stalk, which entered the urethra, and passed into the\r\nbladder, where it caused symptoms which required the operation of\r\nlithotomy. The foreign body extracted was three inches long, and three\r\nlines thick. Would it be believed, that Civiale has extracted from the\r\nbladder of a man, by means of lithotrity, a bean, which was introduced\r\neleven months before, and which gave rise to all the symptoms of stone?\r\nA volume might be filled with facts of a similar character. Many may be\r\nfound in the Ephemerides Curiosorum, Memoirs of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences, those of the Royal Society of Medicine, and of the Academy of\r\nSurgery; in the works of Chopart, Deschamps, Lamotte, Tolet, Morgagni,\r\nVan Swieten, Morand, Pouteau, &c.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of these practices are not simply those which are stated in\r\nthe facts already mentioned; nor are they confined to exhausting the\r\nrest of the sensibility preserved in the genital organs: they finally\r\ncause chronic diseases of the urethra and bladder. These organs, when\r\nconstantly irritated by applications which in individuals not entirely\r\nexhausted are always painful--these organs inflame; indurations,\r\nulcerations, and strictures, form in the urethra; after which supervene\r\nall the symptoms of acute and chronic blenorrhea, detentions of urine,\r\nand catarrh of the bladder.\r\n\r\nVenereal delirium has led other individuals to use processes no less\r\nridiculous, and equally as dangerous. The penis of those who are thus\r\nunfortunate has remained in the places where it has been introduced,\r\nwith a view to imitate the natural process better. Sabatier has related\r\nthe case of a young man, who had passed his penis through the handle\r\nof a key. The handle had been pushed far towards the pubis, and the\r\npenis had swelled so as to conceal it from sight: the swelling was also\r\nincreased by the efforts of the patient to withdraw it. After oiling\r\nthe parts well, the handle was slipped down as far as the glans; but\r\nhere scarifications were required, to diminish the engorgement, before\r\nthe penis could be liberated. After this, escars sloughed off, which\r\nwere followed by cicatrices, which rendered the part deformed, although\r\na sound was introduced into the urethra, to prevent this result.\r\n\r\nThe same author relates that a young man had passed his penis into a\r\ncopper ring: this, however, was fortunately divided with a pair of\r\nstrong scissors. Another used a rough iron ring for this purpose. The\r\npenis puffed out, above and below this ring. A locksmith was called in,\r\nto file it off, which could only be done by placing small bits of wood\r\nbetween the penis and the iron ring. Much time was required to remove\r\nit. In the same manner--that is, by filing--a ring was removed from\r\nanother patient, where gangrene had threatened to appear.\r\n\r\nOne of the most horrid cases of this kind on record, is that of a young\r\nman, who, on taking a bath, indulged in masturbation, by placing his\r\npenis into the hole in the bottom of the tub, made for the removal of\r\nthe water. The glans soon became so much swelled, that he could not\r\nwithdraw it. His cries brought him assistance; but it was not easy to\r\nremove him from the fetters he had forged for himself. (_Dict. des Sc.\r\nMed._, vol. xxi., p. 167.)\r\n\r\nMany similar cases have occurred in Dupuytren’s practice. One was that\r\nof a young man who came to the clinical lecture at Hotel Dieu, having\r\nthe socket of a candlestick, in front of which the glans was enormously\r\ntumefied. Being unable, by any effort, to remove it, the cylindrical\r\nportion surrounding the penis was filed, and thus taken from him. It\r\nwould occupy too much room, to enumerate all the facts of this kind\r\nwhich have been noted by practitioners; but a common accident, and\r\nwhich has been seen several times by Dupuytren, is the ligature of\r\nthe penis by a thread or wire. Some young men, and even adults, have\r\nbound the penis in fits of erotic delirium, so that the knot could not\r\nbe loosed; and a circular section has been made in the skin, and the\r\nurethra even has been opened and cut. It is evident, that, in these\r\ncases, the only thing to be done is to divide the thread, to dress the\r\nwound, and then to introduce a gum-elastic sound, in order to prevent\r\nthe formation of an urinary fistula, or of an accidental hypospadias.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of strangulation--which is much less serious, however,\r\nthan those we have mentioned--may result from masturbation and coition,\r\nin those individuals where the opening of the prepuce is too narrow.\r\nThis prolongation of the skin, after being drawn violently back behind\r\nthe corona glandis, strangles the penis, as would be done by a foreign\r\nbody, and cannot be brought again to its primitive situation: there is\r\nthen a paraphimosis. All authors who have treated of this affection,\r\nhave placed among the causes of it that which we have mentioned. We\r\nhave seen several instances of this character. I will cite that of a\r\nyoung boy, seven or eight years old, in whom this accident was produced\r\nduring masturbation. The glans was tumefied, and the prepuce formed a\r\nlarge fold around it. The frightened parents sent for our assistance.\r\nMethodical and long continued pressure soon brought things to their\r\nproper state.\r\n\r\n_Herpes praeputialis_, another affection of the prepuce, may arise from\r\nthe constant excitement of this part. Fortunately, this eruption is a\r\nslight disease, and generally terminates in a week or two, even without\r\nmedical treatment.\r\n\r\nPersons who indulge in lascivious ideas, are often affected with a\r\ndischarge from the end of the penis--and this though there has been no\r\nmasturbation--of a viscid, whitish mucus, which leaves on the linen\r\nspots similar to those produced by the white of an egg. The edges of\r\nthe meatus urinarius may also be glued together, by the drying of this\r\nmucus. This discharge, which has been described by John Hunter, is\r\nnot a disease, although it has all the appearance of it; and it keeps\r\nsome people in constant fear, lest they have contracted gonorrhœa. It,\r\nhowever, results from an unusual excitement of the mucous membrane,\r\nlining the glans and urethra. Now, if the simple excitement of the\r\nvenereal sense can cause such an effect, what might not be expected\r\nfrom excesses in coition or masturbation? Thus, these causes are\r\nmentioned, whenever the causes of balanitis and blenorrhagia are\r\nalluded to. All authors agree on this subject; and if but few cases are\r\nbrought forward in support of this opinion, it is because the subject\r\nhas not been disputed. The following is found in a dissertation of\r\nCloss. The patient was a young man addicted to masturbation, who had\r\nbeen affected for more than six months with a gonorrhœal discharge,\r\nwhich had been neglected because it occasioned no suffering. The\r\nmatter of the discharge, however, becoming acrid, green, and yellow,\r\nhe was obliged to ask medical advice. He protested, under oath, that\r\nhe had never been exposed to contract disease; and Closs, therefore,\r\nconsidered this blenorrhea as the result of masturbation, in which the\r\npatient had indulged even before puberty.\r\n\r\nThis symptom is seen still more frequently after excesses in coition,\r\nespecially if attended with excesses in drinking, as Lallemand has\r\nremarked, or if one has cohabited with a female whose genital organs\r\nwere very small. It has often been observed in the newly married, and\r\nhas sometimes occasioned unmerited suspicions and reproaches. It is\r\nsaid, too, that excesses indulged in by persons whose genital organs\r\nare perfectly sound, may produce in one or both of them a more or less\r\nintense blenorrhea. Cullerier and Ratier say, that they have verified\r\nthis fact several times. Can such a blenorrhea be communicated? Cassan,\r\nin the Bulletin Universel of Ferussac, has inserted a note, in which he\r\nstates that many of the facts observed in man and animals, particularly\r\nof the genus Bos, prove, that blenorrhea, which is simply the result\r\nof venereal excesses between healthy individuals, easily assumes a\r\ncontagious character, and is attended with symptoms analogous to those\r\nof syphilis, and requires the same treatment.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the urethra may become very intense, and extend\r\nto the bladder, particularly when venereal excesses coexist with\r\nintemperate habits: the discharge of urine may then be interrupted, and\r\nconsequently all the symptoms of dysuria and strangury may supervene.\r\nChronic catarrh of the bladder is often observed, also, in those\r\nindividuals who have abused the pleasures of love.\r\n\r\nMontegre, speaking of a kind of cystitis, which he terms _vesical\r\nhemorrhoids_, mentions among its causes venereal excesses, and\r\nparticularly those repeated titillations, which keep the genital organs\r\nin a state of semi-orgasm, which is not terminated by any crisis.\r\n\r\nLallemand reports the case of an individual, who, being addicted to\r\nvenereal excesses, experienced frequent desire to urinate, and found\r\nit difficult to empty his bladder. Finally, unable to pass water\r\nwithout the use of a sound, he learned to introduce it himself. This\r\nwas not difficult, although the bladder could not be emptied without\r\nit. The urine was turbid, thick, and deposited a great deal of glairy\r\nmucus, which adhered to the pot de chambre. The prostatic portion of\r\nthe urethra was cauterized, but without success. Lallemand thought\r\nthat there was a morbid development of the middle lobe of the prostate\r\ngland. In another patient, whose history is given by this excellent\r\nobserver, excessive masturbation appeared to have predisposed to a\r\nchronic inflammation of the genito-urinary organs, which were developed\r\nunder the influence of the abuse of coition. (_Obs._, &c., p. 440.)\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen, that if coition and masturbation may cause all\r\nthese inflammations, so, too, they may sustain and increase them.\r\nThe pleasures of love, therefore, should be strictly forbidden to\r\npersons affected with diseases of the genito-urinary passages. Acute\r\ninflammation of the urethra, blenorrhagia, has often been known\r\nto pass to a chronic state by a single act of venery; which, says\r\nLewedrain, may even cause this change several months after the apparent\r\ntermination of acute blenorrhagia.\r\n\r\nMay an incontinence of urine be produced by excesses in coition or\r\nmasturbation? We have more than once seen this disease in young\r\nonanists. Sainte Marie, also, places it among the symptoms of\r\ndaily involuntary pollution; and Lallemand has remarked, that most\r\nindividuals affected with this pollution had been subject, in their\r\ninfancy, to incontinence of urine. May not the relations between these\r\ntwo affections extend to the causes which determine them?\r\n\r\nOne of the most common causes of excesses in venery is, the\r\n_involuntary loss of semen_. This disease, which has been termed\r\n_spermatorrhœa_, _involuntary pollution_, may also arise from other\r\ncauses; but as it results most frequently from excesses in masturbation\r\nor coition, we shall devote particular attention to it.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the mode in which the excretion of semen takes place in\r\nthe normal state. It is the remote consequence of a voluntary action,\r\nand the immediate result of involuntary contractions. The venereal\r\nsense is excited voluntarily, either by copulation, or by applying the\r\nhand: this excitement is carried to as great an extent as possible; and\r\nthen a crisis, entirely independent of the will, terminates it. This\r\ncrisis occurs sooner or later. It may even be quickened or retarded by\r\nthe will, which may excite or modify the venereal sense; but when it\r\ndoes take place, it is always by involuntary contractions--that is, by\r\na true convulsion.\r\n\r\nThis last action has two well marked periods. In the first, the semen\r\npasses from the seminal vesicles into the urethra; in the second,\r\nthis liquid is violently expelled. The contraction of the seminal\r\nvesicles--and perhaps, also, that of the levatores ani muscles--are\r\nthe powers by which the semen comes into the urethra. The ejaculation\r\nis caused by the muscles of the perinœum, and particularly by the\r\nbulbo-cavernosus muscle. The swelling and hardness of the corpus\r\ncavernosum furnish this muscle with a point of resistance, which\r\nenables it to compress more efficiently the semen with which the\r\nurethra is filled; and the straightening of this canal, by the\r\nerection, renders the expulsion of this fluid more easy. All these\r\nmotions take place by jerks; and, we repeat it, convulsively, without\r\nthe aid of the will.\r\n\r\nThe involuntary excretion of the semen, the morbid pollution, may take\r\nplace sometimes in the manner described, sometimes in another mode.\r\nIn the first case, it differs from what occurs in the normal state,\r\nonly not being preceded by those acts which are performed voluntarily\r\nby man. Secondly, the semen is excreted without any convulsive effort;\r\nit flows like the tears, the saliva, the bile. The semen comes into\r\nthe urethra, and escapes from it merely because it is there. There\r\nis no ejaculation: and this is easily conceived of; for the genital\r\norgans are not sufficiently excited, to cause the ejaculatory powers to\r\nbe convulsed, as is proved by the excessive weakness of the venereal\r\nsensation. And, secondly, one of the indispensable conditions of\r\nthe ejaculation--erection of the penis--does not exist. There are,\r\nthen, two kinds of involuntary pollutions; one which is _convulsive_,\r\nand the other which is _not so_. Between these two kinds, there are\r\nintermediate degrees, in which spermatorrhœa partakes more or less of\r\none or the other. These degrees often mark the passage from convulsive\r\nspermatorrhœa to that which is not convulsive; for the latter has\r\ngenerally been preceded by the former. We shall see hereafter, that the\r\nexistence of one of these affections does not forbid that of the other;\r\nand that the ejaculation of semen is possible in some individuals who\r\npresent habitually an insensible flow of this fluid.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary pollutions have been distinguished until now in another\r\nmanner: they have been divided into _diurnal_ and _nocturnal_.\r\nThese distinctions are founded only on accessory circumstances.\r\nWhat difference does it make, whether the pollutions occur by night\r\nor by day, provided they are similar in other respects? If, on the\r\ncontrary, there are more essential differences, why not give to them\r\nthe importance they demand? Farther: is not convulsive spermatorrhœa,\r\nlike that which is not convulsive, seen both at night and day? These\r\nare the reasons why we have sought to distinguish these affections more\r\nlogically, and which have led us to propose the new distinction just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nConvulsive spermatorrhœa may occur in all individuals, and under the\r\ninfluence of a great many causes, without being necessarily a disease.\r\nAfter excessive continence, it may even prove a salutary crisis. This\r\npollution has a pathological character, when it is repeated too often,\r\nor under unfavorable circumstances; and then it produces the same\r\nresult as excesses in coition or masturbation, and generally occurs\r\nonly in individuals already enfeebled by this kind of excess. Sleep\r\nis the most favorable state for an attack of spermatorrhœa; and from\r\nthis circumstance it is called nocturnal pollution. The temperature of\r\nthe bed, and lying on the back--circumstances which favor the warmth\r\nand excitement of the lower part of the spinal marrow--may also cause\r\nthe convulsive excretion of the semen. But another cause of it is,\r\nthat during the sleep of the external senses, the internal senses have\r\ncontrol, and have more power, because the action of the others is\r\ncompletely suspended. Cabanis remarks this fact, in saying that the\r\ngenital organs do not participate in the repose of the external senses,\r\nbut seem to be more excitable when these are asleep. We consider, that\r\nwhat takes place then is analogous to what is observed in idiots,\r\nwho, deaf, blind, and dead to all the feelings of relation, abandon\r\nthemselves to every excess, to satisfy a sense, the excitement of which\r\nin them often amounts to constant satyriasis.\r\n\r\nIf the sleep be very profound, pollution may take place without the\r\nconsciousness of the patient, or, at any rate, without his remembrance\r\nof it. When he wakes, the loss of semen is then discovered only by its\r\nstain, and the state of fatigue, weakness, and malaise attending it. A\r\nlascivious dream, however, generally attends a pollution. These dreams\r\nare not, as is generally thought, the cause of the pollution: if they\r\nexist, it is because the venereal sense, which is excited, speaks for\r\nitself, even as hunger, thirst, or any internal sensation may do. These\r\ndreams have a peculiar character, which has been pointed out by many\r\nwriters. The individual is rarely placed in voluptuous circumstances,\r\nwhere his imagination places him during his waking hours; but he is\r\nsurrounded by females who are hideous and repelling, and whom he is as\r\nit were compelled to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, these pollutions fatigue more than those which are excited\r\nvoluntarily. On rising, the patient experiences a general and more\r\nor less distinct feeling of feebleness and of suffering. His loins\r\nand limbs seem as if he had taken a long walk, or as if they had been\r\nbruised; the countenance is pale; the eyelids are swelled and bluish;\r\nthe patient is sad and stupid. Finally, he presents physically and\r\nmorally the consequences of an abuse of venery. It may readily be\r\nimagined, that the periods of spermatorrhœa render the exhaustion more\r\nrapid than the voluntary excesses already commenced. If, contrary to\r\ncustom, the onanist remains one night without pollution, the organs\r\nwhich he permits to rest supply the unaccustomed activity. Happy is\r\nhe, when these symptoms do not seem to him an evidence that this flow\r\nof semen is necessary. Every thing which specially excites the genital\r\norgans, as lascivious thoughts, voluptuous sights, riding, a soft and\r\nwarm bed, &c., and also every thing which produces a more general\r\nexcitement, in which these organs participate, as wine, liquors,\r\ncoffee, spices, &c.; are so many causes which combine with the direct\r\nprovocations of the patient, to multiply the causes by which he is\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal pollutions, however, are not formidable to those onanists\r\nwho are reformed. Inspired by the sentiment of self-preservation,\r\nwarned by the sufferings, counsels, and by reading, they have resolved\r\nto abandon for ever the manœuvres which they know to be dangerous.\r\nThis resolution they will be able to keep: they, however, anxiously\r\ndemand if they are not too late. The genital organs rebel against the\r\ndecision. How melancholy must be the state of the patient! He sees, in\r\nperspective, sufferings, even a death, which seems to be inevitable.\r\nTo avoid it, he had made a sacrifice; he has abandoned those tastes\r\nwhich exercised such absolute control over him: but his organs, which\r\nhave been irritated, continue the work which he wished to interrupt.\r\nHe is irritated--he despairs. Let him be of good cheer; when the will\r\nperseveres, it generally triumphs. I attended an onanist, who was\r\nsuddenly converted by reading the work of Tissot, and who experienced\r\nall the troubles to which we have alluded. He was constantly tormented\r\nby the remembrance of the past night, and the fear of that which was\r\nto come. He slept on a coarse bed; and always enveloped the privy\r\nparts with linen, wet with vinegar and water, before going to sleep;\r\npromising himself to awake, as soon as he was assailed by dreams.\r\nBy his will, however, he finally succeeded; and he had the power of\r\nwatching himself during sleep. His pollutions gradually became less\r\nfrequent, and finally disappeared entirely. This is generally the case\r\nwhere all bad habits cease.\r\n\r\nConvulsive spermatorrhœa is not very common, while a person is awake:\r\nit then rarely presents the purely convulsive character, with perfect\r\nerection, and distinct ejaculation, that is seen in a healthy emission\r\nof semen. This state, however, is possible: an instance of it may be\r\nseen in the case of satyriasis stated by M. Duprest-Rony. Whenever this\r\nyoung man beheld his mistress looking at him, erection took place, and\r\nejaculation followed. He, however, had refrained from masturbating for\r\ntwo years, and had regained in a great measure his former strength. M.\r\nSainte Marie has reported a case of priapism, during which the patient\r\nejaculated fourteen times in a few hours. But this affection was not in\r\nconsequence of venereal excesses, and the emission of semen presented\r\nnothing more extraordinary than other cases of priapism. Diurnal\r\nconvulsive pollution is seldom accompanied, in individuals exhausted\r\nby abuses of masturbation and coition, with a perfect erection. The\r\nsize of the penis increases, but it does not become hard. The semen is\r\nthen emitted only to a short distance, if there be any ejaculation. The\r\nleast cause, the slightest touch, is sufficient to excite this. Thus,\r\nin a man thirty years old, whom Tissot has mentioned, after Boerhaave,\r\nthe semen escaped whenever there was a commencement of an erection,\r\nfor it was never complete; and instead of being expelled forcibly,\r\nit oozed out drop by drop. The patient became impotent. This symptom\r\n(adds Tissot) is very frequent among those who are exhausted, and it\r\ncontributes to continue the exhaustion. The slightest excitement causes\r\nthe commencement of an erection, which is followed by an emission.\r\nWe have seen a similar phenomenon in one of the patients of M.\r\nDalandeterie. There were frequent painful erections, of short duration,\r\nwhich always terminated by a more or less abundant discharge of fluid.\r\nThese kinds of pollutions were always painful, and were followed by\r\nextreme prostration. It is evident, from the remarks we have quoted,\r\nthat there was no ejaculation in this patient; and probably, also,\r\nthe erections, though painful, were imperfect. Daily convulsive\r\nspermatorrhœa assumes then, as it were, a bastard character in\r\nonanists: it occupies an intermediate place between proper convulsive\r\nspermatorrhœa, such as occurs during sleep, and the non-convulsive\r\nspermatorrhœa, which we shall mention directly.\r\n\r\nThere is a phenomenon very similar to this bastard spermatorrhœa, and\r\nwhich shows itself when the patient is inclined to indulge in coition\r\nor masturbation: the emission of semen takes place on the commencement\r\nof the act of venery. It is a quasi involuntary pollution. In this\r\ncase, which is by no means rare, the erection is not complete, simply\r\nbecause there is not time for it to be so, the premature emission of\r\nsemen not admitting it to be perfect. Sometimes, erection is radically\r\nimpossible, and prevents the ejaculation. This was the case with the\r\nonanist who wrote to Tissot, that the semen would flow, but there was\r\nno ejaculation. Farther: when there is no erection, either because\r\nthis is impossible, or because the semen is discharged prematurely,\r\nthe person becomes impotent, because the power of procreating requires\r\nerection and ejaculation.\r\n\r\nIn persons affected with spermatorrhœa, the seminal fluid must preserve\r\nits normal characters. It is generally thinner, less opaque, and\r\nsimilar to serum: sometimes it resembles a fetid sanies or corrupt\r\nmucus; in other cases:, the seminal vesicles are evidently affected.\r\nSometimes, blood is exhaled from these vesicles, and is even\r\nejaculated. We have already stated instances of this emission. Tissot,\r\nalso, has published a case of it. It was a young man, less than sixteen\r\nyears old, who indulged in onanism to such an extent, that blood was\r\nfinally emitted, instead of semen. This emission was soon followed by\r\nexcessive pains, and an inflammation of all the genital organs. We must\r\nremark, that blood never seems to be discharged, unless the pollution\r\nis excited directly: this, at least, would seem to follow from the\r\ncases stated, and particularly from one mentioned by Dalandeterie. The\r\nerections (said he) always terminate with a more or less abundant flow\r\nof mucus--perhaps, also, of prostatic fluid, or even of a very diluted\r\nsemen. In ejaculations excited by the hand, a semi-clotted, blackish\r\nblood comes, instead of semen: sometimes, a teaspoonful is discharged.\r\nThis is always attended with pains, and followed by great prostration.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that involuntary pollution may take place, like voluntary\r\npollution, by the convulsive contraction of the ejaculatory muscles,\r\nwith erection of the penis, and sensations of venery. We have also\r\nseen, that the semen may be discharged, although the erection of the\r\npenis, the sensation of venery, and the convulsive contraction of the\r\nejaculatory muscles is slight, and almost nothing. When this exists\r\nto a still greater degree, we have _non-convulsive_ spermatorrhœa, or\r\n_diurnal involuntary pollution_, as it is called: here there is no\r\nerection, convulsion, nor ejaculation; there is no feeling of venery;\r\nthe semen flows, instead of being expelled; and there is no feeling of\r\npleasure attending this discharge.\r\n\r\nThis affection may arise from different causes. It is owing most\r\nfrequently to venereal excesses; and, as but little is known in regard\r\nto it, we shall enlarge on the subject. This pollution for a long time\r\nwas confounded with all the discharges from the urethra, which were\r\nblended under the term gonorrhœa. A contrary opinion was then adopted,\r\nand the existence of the disease was denied _in toto_. The remarks\r\nof several authors, and particularly of Wichmann, Sante Marie, and\r\nLallemand, place its existence, however, beyond a doubt. The first\r\nideas on this kind of spermatorrhœa may be referred to the earliest\r\nperiods of medicine. It was known to Hippocrates, who has mentioned\r\n(_De Morbis_, lib. ii., sect. 5) one of the principal symptoms, the\r\nloss of semen, during the emission of urine, and of feces, when\r\ndescribing the tabes dorsalis which affects libertines and those\r\nlately married. Celsus, also, (_De Medicina_, lib. iv., ch. 28,) has\r\nadmitted that there may be loss of semen, without pleasure, without\r\nvoluptuous dreams, and which may be followed by a fatal consumption.\r\nAfter this, we find no mention of the disease for a long period.\r\nTauvry says positively, (_Naw. Anat. raisonnée_, 1693, p. 164,) that\r\nmen who abuse themselves are liable to have emissions of semen on\r\nthe slightest compression of the seminal vesicles, when they pass\r\nurine or feces. Morgagni admits that the semen may escape without any\r\npleasurable sensation, as happens from the effect of an injection which\r\nis too warm, and from the excretion of hardened feces; but he adds,\r\nthat the fluid discharged may come in some from the prostate gland,\r\nin others, from the seminal vesicles. There is much uncertainty on\r\nthis point of science among authors, many of whom have considered as\r\nspermatic most of the discharges from the urethra. The dissertation of\r\nWichmann, however, on the subject of diurnal pollution, is valuable.\r\nThis dissertation was printed in 1782, at Gœttingen. In it, Wichmann\r\nstates, first, the characters which distinguish diurnal from nocturnal\r\npollution. The first occurs when the patient is awake, and without\r\nhis experiencing erection or desire. He is unconscious of it; and\r\nthis circumstance, with the absence of any swelling of the corpora\r\ncavernosa, and of all venereal ardor, serves to distinguish this\r\npollution from the flow of the fluid of the prostate gland, or from a\r\nloss of semen, which takes place in some persons when they are excited\r\nby desire. To these characters, Wichmann adds another, drawn from the\r\nmode in which the excretion of semen takes place. In diurnal pollution,\r\n(says he,) men do not lose their semen constantly by a continual\r\nexcretion of this fluid, like females subject to leucorrhea; but they\r\nejaculate, at a single time: and this circumstance has rendered the\r\nterm pollution applicable to this disease. He does not consider, as\r\na diurnal pollution, the gonorrhœa in which the semen is continually\r\nescaping drop by drop. He, however, doubts the existence of this\r\nlast affection, and remarks that authors are very much confused on\r\nthe subject. Nor would a pollution which was involuntary, and during\r\nthe hours of waking, be considered as a diurnal pollution, if the\r\nevacuation of semen had been caused by any aphrodisiac substance. And\r\non this topic, he relates the case of a man, who, having been addicted\r\nto onanism in his youth, was affected with involuntary pollutions if a\r\nblister was applied to him, if he perceived the odor of cantharides, or\r\neven spoke of them.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wichmann, the semen never escapes with the urine: thus,\r\nit is not a seminal discharge which comes from persons affected with\r\nexternal or internal hemorrhoids, who pass off with their urine a\r\nmilky fluid. He, however, admits, with Hippocrates, that the straining\r\nof persons at stool often occasions, in those affected with diurnal\r\npollution, the discharge of a greater or less quantity of semen. When\r\nthe existence of this affection is suspected, we must attempt to\r\nascertain its truth; and for this purpose, the patient should be made\r\nto urinate freely; and then, in passing the feces, he should sit in\r\nsuch a manner that the penis may be outside, and one can see all that\r\nescapes from it in the efforts at stool. In a diurnal pollution, there\r\nis rarely as much semen lost as in a nocturnal pollution. The disease\r\nis quite as serious, if it be semen which escapes--if it occurs once\r\na-day, and even more frequently; and at the lightest effort to stool,\r\nand without any pleasure, to inform one of the risk which is run.\r\n\r\nThus, then, involuntary emissions of semen, while the patient is awake,\r\nwithout erection, without pleasure, and while the patient is ignorant\r\nof it; an emission which takes place, not drop by drop, but at one\r\ntime, and especially while at stool, are, according to Wichmann,\r\nspecific characters of involuntary diurnal pollution.\r\n\r\nThe general effects of this diurnal pollution, as he has often observed\r\nthem, are those seen in onanists. He remarks:--When you see a man\r\nextremely thin, pale, stupid, enervated, complaining of great debility,\r\nespecially in the thighs and loins, lazy in his actions, and with\r\nsunken eyes, you have reason to suspect this cause.\r\n\r\nPatients in this state never complain of any absolute pain. Their\r\ndigestive powers are ruined: the appetite, however, continues--even\r\nincreases, and sometimes becomes voracious. After taking food, they\r\nseem to have more strength; but this advantage is soon paid for, by the\r\ninconveniences resulting from digestion--especially if that variable\r\nappetite be too much indulged. As the stomach and most of the other\r\nviscera do not perform their functions properly, the more that is eaten\r\nthe more the belly is tumefied, by the relaxation of the digestive\r\norgans. This swelling is attended with a painful feeling of anxiety,\r\nwhich exists in these unfortunates at other periods of the day, and\r\nimpels them to avoid society. They are more disposed to sorrow than\r\nto joy--that is, the news of an unfortunate event brings with it more\r\nsorrow than that of a happy event causes pleasure. In them, as in\r\nonanists, there is a want of intelligence; they are stupid; natural\r\nsleep does not refresh them; the memory and sight are particularly\r\ndebilitated. And this is the state of things, until the patient becomes\r\naffected with phthisis. At first, neither moral causes, nor affections\r\nof the soul, nor disappointment, can be suspected. There is apparently\r\nno viscus affected; nor can we ascribe the disease to any deleterious\r\nsubstance concealed in the body, and consuming the flesh. The patient\r\nhas no pain, excepting that obtuse, compressive pain, which is referred\r\nto the hypochondria, and which depends on the swelling of the weak\r\nintestines. If you add to the characters the absence of fever, and of\r\nthe ordinary causes of exhaustion, you may be persuaded that diurnal\r\npollution exists--that it is the hidden cause of all the symptoms. This\r\nis a general description of the disease, drawn up from a considerable\r\nnumber of cases which we have observed.\r\n\r\nWichmann, also, remarks the resemblance between individuals affected\r\nwith diurnal pollution and those affected with phthisis pulmonalis.\r\nExperience has taught me, (says he,) that in many patients who have\r\nbeen considered as affected with true phthisis, the disease must be\r\nreferred to this cause alone. The symptoms of diurnal pollution are not\r\nvery dissimilar to those of the first period of phthisis pulmonalis,\r\nat this purely spasmodic period, which I should be tempted to term\r\ninsidious, if I considered merely the difficulty and uncertainty of the\r\ndiagnosis at this period. The cough which then attends some patients,\r\nalso, leads physicians to dread phthisis: or, rather, consumption,\r\narising from diurnal pollution, assumes so much the characters and\r\nform of this disease, that one is disposed to treat it by the ordinary\r\nmethod, to the great disparagement of the patient, whose state requires\r\nopposite remedies. Farther: it is clear, that the disease of which we\r\nspeak must infallibly terminate in phthisis, if it be not soon arrested.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, Wichmann observed internal pollution for the first time. The\r\ncase was that of a young man, over twenty years of age, who for a long\r\ntime had been affected with spasms. “He was manifestly in a state of\r\ncachochymia, and of wasting away. The physicians whom he had consulted\r\nbefore he came to me judged, from these appearances, that he was\r\nhypochondriac: in fact, different symptoms led to the belief that the\r\ndisease was situated in the hypochondria. The loss of strength--the\r\nlanguor of digestion, although the appetite was not lost--the paleness\r\nof the countenance--the sadness and pusillanimity which led him to\r\nseek solitude--the vivid redness which rushed over his cheeks in\r\nconversation--his restlessness of character--and, finally, a certain\r\nweakness of intellect--seemed to justify the diagnosis. He had formerly\r\nindulged with females, and had been affected with venereal disease,\r\nto which he attributed his present state. Although there was not the\r\nslightest trace of these old affections, the physician, misled by the\r\nfalse conjectures of the patient, had kept him for a long time on\r\nmercurial preparations, by which the symptoms were aggravated, the true\r\ncause being overlooked.\r\n\r\n“Mercury was then abandoned for tonics; and the ferruginous waters were\r\nemployed, with the idea that the patient suffered from hypochondria.\r\nBut this was no better than the former treatment; and the patient\r\nbegged me to take charge of him. I could not attribute the extreme\r\nthinness which existed to the remnant of an imperfectly cured venereal\r\naffection, nor to the usual cause of exhaustion and fever. I then\r\nasked the patient if he indulged with females, or in onanism; or if\r\nhe was affected with involuntary loss of semen. He almost swore to\r\nthe contrary. I then told him of his obligation to speak the truth,\r\nand assured him that I should not prescribe for him until he was\r\nattentively examined. Some days after, he came to me again, and told\r\nme that he had been affected with something like loss of semen. I\r\nsatisfied myself that the observation was correct. The cause of the\r\nevil being known, the treatment was simple. In a few months, the\r\npatient was restored to health; and this happy effect of the remedies\r\nproved that we had attacked the origin of the evil.\r\n\r\n“This young man had probably indulged in premature excesses: in fact,\r\nthis is the most usual cause of involuntary pollution. All the patients\r\nobserved by me, (says Wichmann,) were from twenty-five to forty years\r\nold. All were addicted to the pleasures of love, or to onanism; or had\r\nbecome affected with blenorrhœa, by intercourse with diseased women.\r\n\r\n“I am led to believe,” (adds he,) “that the effects of onanism would\r\nnot be so pernicious, were it not for this diurnal pollution; that\r\nwithout it, this shameful habit would not be followed with consumption,\r\nand other symptoms of phthisis. In fact, onanism does not always give\r\nrise to this pollution. If this were the case, the number of onanists\r\naffected with consumption would be very great. The number of men\r\naddicted to this vice from early childhood is immense; for we do not\r\nknow a greater scourge than this social corruption. From the fact, too,\r\nthat onanism sometimes produces involuntary diurnal pollution, we ought\r\nto investigate if it does not exist in those who have renounced this\r\npernicious habit. Advice to them would be useless, inasmuch as, having\r\nrenounced this vice, they do not suspect the enervating cause which\r\ndestroys them. About eighteen years ago, before I had discovered this\r\ncause of consumption, I knew a young man, thirty years old, who had\r\nbeen addicted to masturbation from the time he was ten years old, and\r\nwho learned this pernicious habit from his preceptor. He died, after\r\nexperiencing all kinds of infirmities, with extreme debility of all\r\nhis physical and moral faculties. He acknowledged his error, and that\r\nfor a long time he had renounced his bad habit; but his late return to\r\ncontinence did not save him. Now, I feel confident that this shameful\r\nhabit had brought on an involuntary diurnal pollution, which caused his\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nWichmann remarks, that it is at the commencement of the fine season of\r\nspring that the patients are most conscious of their situation. They\r\nowe this increase of their ills (says he) to that general procreative\r\nfaculty which becomes more active in all animated beings at this period\r\nof the year. The more full the vesicles of semen, the more liable are\r\npatients to lose it. We must also remark, that most patients secrete\r\nprolific semen, and preserve their procreative power. This, however,\r\nrequires the patient to have the faculty of erection; for, otherwise,\r\nhe would be impotent. This was the case with an individual, whose case\r\nis stated by Henry Van-Hers.\r\n\r\nA young man of rich family, and who had arrived at puberty, consulted\r\nthis physician, avowing, that from the time he was ten years old, he\r\nhad enjoyed frequent intercourse with young girls, who had excited him\r\nby their lascivious touches; adding, that from this period the power\r\nof erection had disappeared. He had travelled for a long time, and\r\nhad received advice from several French physicians. He went to the Spa\r\nwaters, and there his case was examined by Van-Hers. The sensibility\r\nand weakness of the genital organs were so great, that on the slightest\r\ntouch, and without any desire for coition, or any sensation, there was\r\na discharge similar to thin milk. This excretion continued both night\r\nand day, whenever he passed urine, or on the least rubbing of his\r\nshirt. A great many remedies had already been tried. Van-Hers regarded\r\nthe disease as incurable, but the young man would not listen to his\r\nadvice; and being very rich, he continued to travel in Italy, France,\r\nEngland, and Germany, in the hope of recovering his lost virility.\r\nHe consulted many physicians. He then had recourse to quacks; and\r\neven tried the powers of magic: but all in vain. After six years of\r\ntravel, he returned to Van-Hers, regretting that he had not taken his\r\nadvice. The young man then returned home, deploring the advantages of a\r\nlarge fortune, which rendered him the victim of a precocious abuse of\r\npleasure, of a kind of premature depravity.\r\n\r\nWichmann’s dissertation was but little known in France, when Sainte\r\nMarie undertook its translation; and not only this, but added many\r\nimportant notes, which have shed new light on diurnal pollution.\r\nWichmann had said, as we have seen, that patients affected with this\r\ndisease _ejaculated_ the semen. This expression was inexact, and has\r\nbeen rectified by M. Sainte Marie. The patients (said he) do not\r\nejaculate the semen; but it runs away from them: it is not emitted with\r\nforce. The characters which it presents had briefly been alluded to by\r\nWichmann: his translator has stated them more clearly. According to\r\nhim, the semen which runs away in diurnal pollution is paler, thinner,\r\nand more watery, than that which escapes when the act is attended with\r\npleasure. Its odor, also, is fainter; and the stains it leaves on the\r\nlinen are slight, superficial, and not very apparent. Wichmann had\r\nadmitted the existence of a discharge from the prostate gland, which\r\nought not to be confounded with diurnal pollution. Sainte Marie has\r\nattempted to point out the characteristics of this discharge. Those in\r\nwhom it exists, (says he,) find the glans moistened in the morning when\r\nthey rise with an unctuous substance: if they then compress the urethra\r\nfrom the root to the end of the penis, they press out some drops of a\r\ngreenish, gluish, and slightly fetid fluid. They thus lose a little of\r\nthis fluid after indulging in desires, or after erections which have\r\nnot been followed by the act of venery. Sainte Marie considers it as\r\nprobable that the mucus of the urethra then mixes with the fluid of the\r\nprostate gland, and forms a part of the discharge.\r\n\r\nThis author confirms Wichmann’s remarks on the general effects of\r\ndiurnal pollution. He says, “Since I read his treatise, I have found\r\nthis pollution in diseases of languor, which I could not attribute to\r\na special or primitive alteration of any organ; and I have discovered,\r\nthat a great many cases of hypochondria, of slow nervous fevers, of\r\nconsumptions, were kept up by this kind of gonorrhœa, to which the\r\npatients, unable to observe themselves, had paid no attention. I have\r\nknown several individuals, who have been affected with this diurnal\r\npollution for a long time, without experiencing any marked derangement\r\nin their health: to them, it was an inconvenience; rather than a\r\ndisease. But in these cases, diurnal pollution is not habitual: it only\r\noccurs when continence of days or weeks, an exciting or substantial\r\nregimen, long exercise on horseback or in a carriage, have accumulated\r\nsemen in its reservoirs, or have irritated specially the genital\r\norgans: then the least effort to expel the feces causes the seminal\r\nvesicles to pour forth the surplus of fluid which they contain. Let not\r\nthis state inspire too much security. Diurnal pollution is commenced:\r\nit is not yet serious; but it may progress, return every day at\r\neach evacuation, and finally produce all the bad results noticed by\r\nWichmann.”\r\n\r\nWichmann said nothing in regard to the organic conditions of the\r\ndiurnal pollution: he merely stated that this affection was the\r\nresult of debility. M. Sainte Marie, on this point, makes many\r\ninteresting remarks. He considers diurnal pollution as sometimes\r\nthe cause, and sometimes the effect, of dorsal consumption; and he\r\nconsiders this to be an affection of the spinal marrow. We will quote\r\nthis passage:--Diurnal pollution (says Sainte Marie) is sometimes\r\nonly an effect; the origin of which must be sought after in a serious\r\nand primitive alteration of an important system of organs. Thus, we\r\nmust reason, for instance, in respect to dorsal consumption. It is\r\nsaid, that one remarkable symptom of this disease is an abundant\r\ndischarge of watery semen, which comes sometimes at each emission\r\nof urine. Involuntary diurnal pollution is here only a symptom: it\r\noccurs, because the genital organs do not receive, _from the spinal\r\nmarrow_, the nervous and well regulated influence which they require\r\nto perform their functions properly. Hence, the super-abundant\r\nsecretion of semen--its unfitness for fecundation--the relaxation of\r\nthe seminal vesicles, which allow it to escape so readily--the atony\r\nof the scrotum--the inconvenient pulling of the spermatic vessels--the\r\nweakness of the erections--impotence, &c., &c. The same state of the\r\norgans which deprives the genital organs of life, explains, on the\r\nother hand, the wasting of parts which respond to this sensitive\r\ncentre--the thinness of the loins, thighs, and lower extremities--the\r\ndebility--the paralysis of these extremities--the obstinate\r\nconstipation, complained of by the patients, and which is similar\r\nto that of old men, yielding only to the employment of stimuli--the\r\nformications along the back--the incontinence of urine--the gangrenous\r\neschars, which at a more advanced period of the disease form on the\r\nsacrum, hips, and trochanters. We might easily pursue this subject,\r\nand extend it to the most general symptoms of consumption, as deep\r\nmelancholy, weakness and slowness of the pulse, disposition to faint,\r\nand all those marked symptoms which assimilate this disease to slow\r\nnervous fever; but this would estrange us from the principle we seek to\r\nestablish--which is, that diurnal pollution is sometimes the cause,\r\nand sometimes only the symptom, of dorsal consumption. Wichmann has\r\ntreated only of the first: the second is connected with a general\r\ndisease, and cannot be studied separately. These remarks of Sainte\r\nMarie will be admitted to be much more important, if compared with our\r\nremarks on the abuse of the genital organs on the spinal marrow, and\r\nwith what we shall say hereafter on the power which this has on the\r\nsame organs.\r\n\r\nSwediaur, who was acquainted with and approved of Wichmann’s work,\r\nadmits, in addition to the diurnal pollution described by this latter,\r\nand which he considers as arising either from relaxation or from\r\nirritation of the testicles and seminal passages--he admits, we say, a\r\nblenorrhœa of the prostate gland, the characters of which, as stated by\r\nhim, are precisely similar to those of diurnal pollution. Blenorrhœa of\r\nthe prostate gland (says he) is a morbid discharge of the mucus from\r\nthis gland, sometimes mingled with the fluid of the seminal vesicles.\r\nIt occurs particularly during the day, and without venereal desire.\r\nThis disease is soon followed with general debility or weakness: this\r\nexhaustion is attended with emaciation of the body, and is followed\r\nby death, if the patient delays consulting a well-educated physician,\r\nas is too often the case; or if the proper remedies are not used in\r\ntime. He admits, also, that the discharge from the prostate gland does\r\nnot occur in some individuals, except when they go to stool; and that\r\nhardened feces, in passing through the rectum, press the prostate\r\ngland more firmly. The discharge is clear mucus, and of a particularly\r\nnauseous odor. Cullerier describes two kinds of spermatorrhœa: one\r\nwith loss of semen and of the prostate fluid; the other, produced by\r\nconstipation. He remarks--Persons who are habitually costive often see\r\na few drops of semen ooze from the penis, while they are at stool.\r\nWe have been consulted several times for cases of this kind. Some\r\nregard it as resulting from a relaxation, a debility of the genital\r\norgans: they imagine that their genital powers are lost, and that their\r\nprocreative power is lost. Others attribute it to old blenorrhœas,\r\nwhich have _struck in_, as it is said. All, generally, are terrified\r\nat the effect; and quacks have often profited by its existence, to\r\npersuade patients that they were affected with an inveterate venereal\r\ndisease, and thus to dispose of their remedies. This effect arises, as\r\nevery one knows, from the pressure of the feces in the rectum on the\r\nseminal vesicles, and may be removed by removing the constipation.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of science, when Lallemand devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of the diseases of the urinary passages, and enriched it with\r\nmany important remarks. As, in acute inflammations of the urethra,\r\nthe irritation sometimes extends, following the course of the seminal\r\npassages to the testicles; so, in retentions of urine, produced by\r\nchronic inflammation of the prostatic portion of the urethra, the\r\nirritation extends more or less to the seminal vesicles and testicles,\r\nproducing in the former normal contractions, and in the latter an\r\nexcessive secretion, whence would result a spermatic flux. In patients\r\nthus affected, the ejaculation is very sudden: nocturnal pollutions\r\nare frequent--or, rather, the semen is expelled during the emission\r\nof urine, and of the feces. It is also more liquid, less odorous, and\r\nin short less elaborated than usual. In many patients, the venereal\r\ndesires are nearly extinct; the erections are feeble, imperfect, or\r\neven impossible. This spermatorrhœa has general effects, analogous to\r\nthose which have been attributed to other pollutions: the patients\r\nbecome timid, idle, indifferent to all which is not connected with\r\ntheir disease; all the functions of the economy languish, and are\r\nderanged; and, finally, both body and mind are degraded.\r\n\r\nLallemand has known all the phenomena which we have described to\r\ndisappear, on curing the retention of urine--or, rather, the disease\r\nof the urethra which caused it--and relates cases of this character.\r\nDo not the remarks of this practitioner, compared with our remarks on\r\nconvulsive spermatorrhœa, and particularly on the different states\r\nwhich the semen may present in this affection--do they not establish\r\nclearly, that in many, perhaps in most cases of spermatorrhœa, there is\r\nnot relaxation, weakness of the seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts,\r\nbut irritation or inflammation of these parts?\r\n\r\nIt would, then, seem well established, that the semen may be discharged\r\nwithout pleasure, without erection, and without ejaculation; and that\r\nthis discharge may give rise to accidents analogous to those observed\r\nafter all free discharges of this fluid, arising from any cause\r\nwhatever. This fact, however, has been contested by different authors.\r\nBoerhaave says positively, that he has never known the semen to escape\r\nspontaneously, without solicitation; and that when such a case has\r\nbeen suspected, the fluid discharged was not probably semen; and that,\r\nfarther, if this kind of spermatorrhœa exists, it must be very rare.\r\nSwammerdam, Hunter, and Haller, have expressed a similar opinion: the\r\nlatter admits that a discharge may take place from the penis, under the\r\ncircumstances mentioned above; he thinks, also, that this discharge\r\ncomes from the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. But the fluid\r\nwhich escapes is only the mucus secreted by these parts--it is not\r\nsemen; and unless opinions had been made up from wrong evidence, wrong\r\nconsequences, it would not have been attributed to it. At present, the\r\nopinion that all cases of spermatorrhœa are only blenorrhœas, is still\r\nvery prevalent. Descamps, physician at Castilliones, having brought\r\nbefore the Medical Society, in 1821, two cases of spermatorrhœa, the\r\nconsequences of masturbation; Chantourelle, who was the reporter,\r\nraised some doubts, which the society seemed to admit, as to the nature\r\nof the discharge, thinking it was mucous, rather than spermatic. We,\r\nhowever, are disposed to think, that when the subject of diurnal\r\npollution is better understood, it will be observed more frequently,\r\nand then its existence will not be denied. It is with the hope of\r\ncontributing to this result, that we have dwelt so long on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf the imperceptible loss of semen may be followed by all the symptoms\r\nwhich are referred to it, it is evident that those authors who have\r\nadvanced that the emission of semen should be counted as nothing in\r\nthe influence of the act of venery, and that the nervous disturbance\r\nwhich attends it is the only cause of its consequences--those authors,\r\nwe say, who assert this, have advanced too positive an opinion, and\r\nare consequently mistaken. The same may be said of those who ascribe\r\nthe danger of venereal excesses simply to the discharge of urine. It\r\nis well ascertained, that those individuals who have carried the act\r\nof onanism to such an extent as to procure enjoyment without losing\r\nsemen, have finally became diseased, and their constitution has been\r\nimpaired. Instances of this might be cited. Fournier and Begin mention\r\nthat of a young man, who, at the moment of ejaculation, compressed the\r\nremote parts of the urethra, so that not a drop of semen was lost.\r\nThe fatigue, however, following efforts of this kind was very great,\r\nnotwithstanding these exertions. Finally, the strength diminished, and\r\nthe person wasted away as much as if the semen had been discharged.\r\n(_Dict. des Sc. Med._, Art. _Masturbation_.)\r\n\r\nThere is frequently some derangement in the functions of the testicles,\r\nin those who have lost the genital sense, where the penis is no\r\nlonger capable of erection, or who are affected by one or other of\r\nthe pollutions mentioned by us. But these organs may be affected more\r\nevidently. In many onanists, these parts are extremely tender, or\r\nmore or less vivid pains are felt, which extend along the cord. These\r\nsymptoms sometimes assume an evidently neuralgic character; and it\r\nmay readily be imagined, that, in individuals affected with wandering\r\npains, excesses in venery may fix them in these parts. This has been\r\nremarked in gout. Hallé and M. Guilbert observed, in a middle-aged\r\nman addicted to excesses of this character, a severe pain in the\r\nleft testicle, unattended by swelling, which extended to the whole\r\nsurface of this organ: this pain followed an attack of articular\r\ngout. Irritation of the testicles sometimes constitutes an attack of\r\norchitis--that is, an inflammation, which, among other consequences,\r\nmay be attended with the loss of these parts. Brodie has published two\r\ncases of this character. The first was that of a young man, thirty\r\nyears old, who entered St. George’s Hospital in 1805, affected with\r\npains in the left testicle. This testicle was soft, flabby, and one\r\nthird smaller than that of the opposite side. The patient had never\r\nreceived a blow on this part, nor had he been affected with blenorrhœa;\r\nbut he admitted, that for five years he had been addicted to onanism,\r\nand that a day seldom passed without his indulgence. Before wasting\r\naway, the testicle had been the seat of a swelling, which had been\r\npreceded by severe pains. These pains had continued to be felt, and\r\nthe disease was attended with such a degree of moral depression,\r\nthat the countenance of the patient assumed a sombre and melancholy\r\ncharacter. This young man was treated by various remedies, but he left\r\nthe hospital uncured. The other patient, on applying to Mr. Brodie, in\r\n1820, was thirty-one years old. Here the two testicles were wasted, and\r\nthe patient was impotent. This man stated that his intercourse with\r\nfemales began when he was fourteen years old; that he had indulged\r\nexcessively for many years; that, when twenty years old, in consequence\r\nof external violence, he was affected with severe inflammation of the\r\ntesticles; that this inflammation had been completely cured; and that\r\nthe wasting of the testicles had commenced some time afterward. In\r\nthree years, the testicles had shrunk to their present size. (_London\r\nMed. and Phys. Journal_, October, 1826.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Morgagni, the too frequent return of venereal ideas will\r\nproduce varicocele and hydrocele. Some authors, also, place venereal\r\nexcesses among the causes of the first of these two diseases, and also\r\nof circosele. We have seen several cases of varicose dilatation of the\r\nspermatic cord and testicle in onanists. This fact is also confirmed\r\nby Breschet, in his memoir read at the Academy of Sciences, Jan. 13th,\r\n1834. He thinks that circosele and varicocele are by no means diseases\r\nof adult and old age, but that they are seen most frequently in young\r\nmen. These affections seem to him to be caused most particularly by\r\nvenereal excesses. He adds, that the varicose tumors of the bursæ,\r\nand the organs they contain, are not only very troublesome, causing\r\nsevere pain in the cord, but that in some patients they cause extreme\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of onanism, which has been omitted by Deslandes, may\r\nbe stated here. We allude to the smallness of the genital organs. In\r\nseveral severe cases of onanism, which have fallen under the notice\r\nof Dr. A. Sidney Doane, of New-York, this important feature has\r\nbeen observed. The same fact has been remarked by Professor John W.\r\nFrancis, of New-York; Professor Otto, of Germany; and by other eminent\r\npathologists.\r\n\r\nExcesses in masturbation and coition, _in females_, cause affection of\r\nthe several organs much more frequently than in males. By too frequent\r\ntitillation, the clitoris may become enormously large. This cause (says\r\nBouillaud) may determine schirrous engorgement, or even a cancerous\r\ndegenerescence of this organ. The most frequent alteration, however,\r\nof the genital organs of the female, which may be thus produced, is\r\nan inflammation of the membrane which lines the vulva and vagina.\r\nThis inflammation is constantly indicated by a more or less abundant\r\nleucorrhœal discharge, and often by swelling, redness, and pain.\r\nWhen this discharge continues, which is often the case, it occasions\r\nin young females symptoms analogous to those of diurnal pollution.\r\nThe complexion loses its color, and becomes yellowish; the eyes are\r\nconstantly suffused, and the countenance is sad; the patients are\r\nfeeble and careless; they generally experience gnawing sensations in\r\nthe epigastric region; and, thinking that these are occasioned by\r\nhunger, are constantly eating. Sometimes, the appetite is voracious,\r\nand the digestive powers are preserved; but these are commonly soon\r\naltered. Severe and constant pains are often felt in the back and\r\nepigastrium; the body wastes; and a short, dry, and frequent cough,\r\nrenders the patient, parents, and sometimes the physician, anxious\r\nas to the state of the chest. Add to these symptoms those already\r\ndescribed, when speaking of the general effects of masturbation, and\r\nyou have the state most frequently presented by girls addicted to this\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nAs females have no testicles, nor organs which, like the testicles in\r\nthe male, serve to prepare and excrete the semen, they cannot have\r\nseminal pollutions: they, however, like men, are subject to voluptuous\r\ndreams, and then there may be a secretion, analogous to that which\r\nexists in them at the moment of the act of venery. May a too frequent\r\nreturn of this symptom have any influence on the health? The only\r\nremarks on the subject, to our knowledge, are to be found in Swediaur.\r\nHe says, when speaking of diurnal pollution--I have seen, although much\r\nmore rarely, similar diseases in the other sex. I have under treatment,\r\nat this moment, a female, twenty-eight years old, who, since her\r\nmiscarriage, a year and a half ago, suffers from frequent involuntary\r\nnocturnal pollutions, excited by libidinous dreams, and attended with\r\nall the symptoms of the tabes dorsalis, described by Hippocrates, as a\r\ndisease of the male. Even the lungs begin to feel this disease. She,\r\nhowever, has been cured.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the external organs of generation, and the fluor albus,\r\nresulting from it, is most generally, at least in young girls who have\r\nnot arrived at puberty, a consequence of onanism. We are convinced,\r\ntoo, that if it were possible to arrive at the facts, we should find\r\nthat the cause of fluor albus in adults was either recent or former\r\nabuses. Whenever we have addressed females on the subject, to ascertain\r\nthis fact, our conjectures have been verified. This has frequently been\r\nthe case with servant girls. We have seen several, who were so weakened\r\nby fluor albus, and the irritation of the sexual parts, that they have\r\nbeen obliged to quit their situations, being unable to do their duty.\r\nWe will even say, that the most sincere of these girls have given me\r\nsuch information as to their habits, that we suspect most of this class\r\nof onanism.\r\n\r\nBesides, all authors who have spoken of leucorrhœa and blenorrhœa in\r\nfemales, have mentioned excesses in masturbation and coition as among\r\ntheir most frequent causes. It would be easy to adduce general evidence\r\nand special cases in support of this proposition; but this would be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons, we may state, that diseases of the uterus may\r\nvery frequently be determined by these excesses, and more particularly\r\nby those of coition. Daily observation proves that acute and chronic\r\ninflammations of the body and neck of the uterus frequently appear in\r\nthose females who have indulged in premature enjoyments.\r\n\r\nWe have attended, for more than ten years, a lady affected with chronic\r\nmetritis, arising from this cause. This lady had began to masturbate\r\nbefore she was eleven years old. She soon became affected with fluor\r\nalbus, from which she has never been free since. When eighteen years\r\nold, she married a vigorous man, and then became addicted to another\r\nkind of excess. She now experienced constant pains in the loins, lower\r\npart of the belly, and in the groins: she was also troubled with a\r\ndisagreeable feeling of fatigue in the upper part of the thighs, and\r\nexperienced as it were a weight, as if something was constantly trying\r\nto escape from the sexual parts. The neck of the uterus, instead of\r\nretaining its usual situation, proved on examination to be almost\r\nat the external orifice of the vagina. Our advice, as to moderation\r\nand abstinence, was but imperfectly followed: she was so addicted to\r\nonanism, that, although she indulged lawfully, and was the mother\r\nof several children, she continued in this habit. It may readily be\r\nimagined that she did not derive much benefit from my advice: in fact,\r\nthe symptoms mentioned above, and many others, still continue. Similar\r\ncases are related by other authors, and have fallen under the notice of\r\nalmost every practitioner.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there was evidently _prolapsus uteri_, or a falling\r\nof the womb: the neck of the uterus was almost at the vulva. This\r\ndisplacement, which is the usual consequence of inflammations of\r\nthe body of the uterus, very often results, like it, from venereal\r\nexcesses. This fact has been noticed by all writers on this subject.\r\nSchirrous and cancerous affections of the neck of the uterus, also,\r\narise from this cause. Cullerier remarks, that uterine affections\r\nin females are loo frequently the sad and cruel consequence of\r\nsolitary manœuvres. Richerand, after stating that premature or too\r\nfrequent indulgence is a cause of cancer of the uterus, says, that of\r\nforty-seven females affected with this disease, eleven had indulged\r\nwith males before the period of puberty, seven at this period, and\r\nmost of them were barren. He adds, that those public girls who escape\r\nvenereal disease generally die of cancer of the uterus. Bayle and Cayol\r\nhave attempted to verify this assertion, by examining numerous cases,\r\nbut they have obtained no marked result; which is not surprising,\r\nconsidering the number of causes, which, especially in hospitals,\r\nrender such investigations useless. The influence of excessive\r\nindulgence, in producing such a disease, is very great. A short time\r\nsince, we were called to a lady, who had a slight syphilitic ulceration\r\nof the neck of the uterus. She, however, still admitted the embraces\r\nof her husband, although they were painful, and were followed by a\r\ndischarge of blood. The parenchyma of the neck, around the ulceration,\r\nwas gradually engorged: it became schirrous, then cancerous, and\r\nthe patient finally died. Probably, coition had great influence in\r\ndeveloping this disease. Such a thing might happen frequently; for\r\nRicord has shown, that superficial ulcerations of the neck of the\r\nuterus are frequent. The cancers which affect these parts, in public\r\nwomen, are, probably, often produced in this manner.\r\n\r\nIn the lady whose case has been mentioned, the act of coition produced\r\na discharge of blood from the vulva. We have seen cases of a similar\r\ncharacter, where the neck of the uterus presented no evidence of\r\norganic alteration to the touch. Females in whom this occurs should,\r\nhowever, be very careful in their pleasures, as this slight accident\r\nindicates a bad state of the system, and one which should be\r\nmistrusted. Sometimes, blood appears on return of coition, when females\r\nhave not indulged for a long time. Rondelon cites an instance of this.\r\nIt occurred in a lady from whom her husband had been absent for three\r\nyears: at the end of this period, he returned. The frequency of coition\r\nthe first night caused excessive uterine hemorrhage. A similar accident\r\nmay result from this act, and a fortiori from its abuse, during or\r\njust before the menstrual period. Very serious hemorrhages have often\r\noccurred in consequence of excessive copulations. Tissot states--In\r\n1746, a girl, twenty-three years old, submitted to the embraces of six\r\nSpanish dragoons, at a house near the gates of Montpelier. She died\r\nthe next day, from excessive hemorrhage of the uterus. A similar case\r\nhas been related by Virey. We know (said he) that a public woman, who\r\nsubmitted in one night to twenty-one soldiers, the next day died, with\r\nhemorrhage of the uterus. This was a dark, thin woman, in the flower\r\nof her age. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, vol. xiv., p. 339.) Onanism causes\r\nin young women, and even in children, a discharge of blood from the\r\nvulva. This fact was mentioned by Duges. The blood lost is then never\r\nabundant, and the occurrence is by no means serious.\r\n\r\nThe irritation produced or kept up by too frequent coition, is very\r\noften the cause of sterility. Even as, generally speaking, an inflamed\r\nsurface refuses to absorb substances applied to it, so irritation of\r\nthe uterus and vagina renders them unfit for impregnation. Thus, then,\r\nlibertinism, instead of adding, as we might think, to the chances of\r\nfecundation, acts in a contrary manner. Marc remarks, that two hundred\r\npublic girls do not produce more than two or three children annually.\r\nFarther: it seems well ascertained, that if these girls resume a\r\nregular life, they again become fruitful. The English, wishing to\r\npeople Botany Bay, transported there a large number of public women.\r\nThose who were sterile in their own country proved fruitful, when\r\nsubjected to the rigid laws of marriage. Is it not notorious, too, that\r\namong the public girls, those who bear children are not those most\r\nfrequently liable to become mothers? De Chanes, physician at Macon, has\r\nestablished, by statistical researches, that but few conceptions take\r\nplace in the early months of marriage--that is, when the congress of\r\nthe sexes is most frequent, and causes the most irritation. Villermé\r\nhas ascertained the same to be true in the early days, and even the\r\nearly weeks, after marriage. Hence, this learned physician regards\r\nthe fecundity of copulations as being inversely as their frequency.\r\nIt may, then, be stated as a fact, that females may become barren, in\r\nconsequence of venereal abuses.\r\n\r\nThese abuses are not only injurious, as opposing reproduction, but\r\nthey also injure, by causing a deterioration of the human family.\r\nMarc asserts, that the few children born of prostitutes rarely have\r\nthe strength and health of those born in lawful wedlock; and that the\r\nmortality of the former is fifty per cent greater than of the latter.\r\nToo early marriages are attended with results similar to those arising\r\nfrom libertinism. Aristotle mentioned this fact. Delafontaine, first\r\nsurgeon of the last king of Poland, attributes the extreme physical\r\ndebility of the Polish Jews to these premature marriages. Marc\r\nsays--It is proved, that the physical strength of the child depends,\r\nin the main, on the mother, rather than on the father; and this is\r\nconfirmed, too, by referring to domestic animals. The height of the\r\npony depends on the mare, rather than on the stallion. Mules, too,\r\nfurnish a striking proof of this. The eggs of pullets, whatever may be\r\nthe size of the cock, are much smaller than those of hens. Farther: it\r\nis well known, that females who become mothers before attaining their\r\nstrength, generally give birth to small children, which are raised with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a former page, that men had recourse to artificial\r\nmeans to procure a semblance of coition. Accidents of a similar\r\ncharacter have happened to girls; and they have been obliged to call\r\nin surgeons to their assistance. There are numerous instances, where\r\nforeign bodies have been introduced into the vagina, and particularly\r\ninto the urethra, and could not be withdrawn. We shall mention some\r\nof them. Pamard has reported that of a girl, thirty-one years old,\r\nwho used an ivory whistle, three inches and a half long, and five\r\nlines round in its centre. This she introduced, not into the vagina,\r\nbut into the urethra. One day, it entered so far, that she could not\r\nremove it. After many efforts, it was withdrawn, with polypus forceps.\r\nAnother girl, seventeen years old, was less fortunate. She was in the\r\nhabit of introducing a large piece of wood into the urethra. This\r\ninstrument having entered very deeply, fell into the bladder. Faure\r\nwas called, and was obliged to cut for it, to extract it. Rigal was\r\nobliged to do the same, to relieve a young girl, twenty years old, who\r\nused a wooden needle-case in masturbating. Needles and pins have often\r\nescaped into these passages. Morgagni asserts that it is by no means\r\nunfrequent in Italy for the lascivious girls to introduce into the\r\nurethra the golden pins worn in their hair, and that they sometimes\r\nfall into the bladder. This they conceal for a long time; but they\r\nare finally obliged, through pain, to confess their fault. Moinichien\r\nmentions a Venetian girl, whom Molinetti relieved of a golden needle,\r\nwhich had slipped from the hand into this organ. In 1751, Lachese,\r\n(according to Morand’s report,) was called to a girl twenty years old,\r\nwho had introduced into the urethra a toothpick, which she had lost;\r\nand after two months, it was extracted. A happy circumstance favored\r\nLamotte in a similar case. An old maid had introduced into the bladder\r\na very large pin. Having sounded several times very patiently and\r\nattentively, Lamotte finally felt the pin distinctly. He sounded for\r\nthe fourth time, when, by accident, it became engaged in the sound.\r\nWishing to withdraw it, and finding some resistance, he introduced his\r\nfinger into the vagina, and ascertained whence it proceeded. By skilful\r\nmanipulation, he now succeeded in withdrawing it. These symptoms\r\nusually happen only in those who are imprudent, and who introduce\r\ninto the urethra an instrument designed for an adjacent passage. The\r\nvagina is so short and large, that foreign bodies seldom remain in\r\nit. For such a thing to take place, certain conditions are requisite,\r\nwhich are not very common. This, however, is possible; and many cases\r\nof it are recorded. The following is mentioned by Dupuytren. A female\r\nconsulted him for some derangement in the vulvo-uterine passage. On\r\nexamination, a foreign body was felt, the nature of which could not at\r\nfirst be determined. The patient refused to give any information on the\r\nsubject: by examining, however, it was found that the body presented a\r\nlarge opening or deep cavity. The tumefied walls of the vagina covering\r\nthe edges of the kind of vessel, prevented its disengagement. After\r\nmuch effort, however, the body was removed; and it proved to be a\r\npomatum-pot, which had been introduced by its base. (_Additions à la\r\nMed. Operat., de Sabatier_; vol. iv., p. 96.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES OF PRESERVATION AND TREATMENT RELATIVE TO VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two indications, which embrace every thing relating to\r\nvenereal excesses. The first is, to prevent the bad effects; the\r\nsecond, to remedy them. To _preserve_, to _recruit_, is what these\r\nexcesses require. Hence, some of the remedial measures must be\r\nhygienic, and others therapeutic. To these, we shall devote two\r\nchapters of this second part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATIVE MEANS RELATIVE TO VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservative rules which relate to venereal excesses present\r\nfundamental differences, as to the success and facility of their\r\napplication, according as reference is made to the act of masturbation\r\nor coition. Let us point out these differences.\r\n\r\nCoition is an act, the mode and purport of which, considered in a\r\nscientific point of view, are legitimate; and which, consequently,\r\nis lawful, so long as the constitution and health are unimpaired.\r\nHence, it should not be prohibited, except when abused--that is,\r\nwhen indulged in too often, or under circumstances which render it\r\ninjurious. Except in these cases, it may be permitted, or even advised.\r\nWhen it is forbidden, the advice is generally understood, as it is\r\ncommonly addressed to adults, children having neither the power nor\r\nthe opportunity to indulge in coition. This advice may be easily\r\nfollowed, as the individual who indulges in coition to excess, may\r\nfind it absolutely impossible to indulge: in fact, means to satisfy\r\nhis taste can only be found by the concurrence of another. Hence, it\r\nis only necessary to shun this concurrence, to render this kind of\r\nexcess impossible. To address one’s self to the reason of an adult--or,\r\nrather, of a young man--and to create for him, if he cannot create\r\nfor himself, obstacles to sexual relations, these are the only two\r\npreservative indications which abuses of coition require. We have\r\ndischarged the first, or have stated the mode of fulfilling it, by\r\nmentioning the bad consequences attending these abuses, and by making\r\nknown the circumstances which render the act of venery injurious to\r\nthose addicted to it. Hence, we shall not return to the subject. The\r\nsecond indication can find no place in a book, and consequently will\r\nnot detain us. Our remedies, then, as to preservation, will apply\r\nexclusively to onanism. In a subsequent page, when we are treating of\r\nthe restorative remedies, the distinction here laid down between this\r\nhabit and coition will disappear; and we can then treat of all venereal\r\nexcesses conjointly.\r\n\r\nAlthough coition, if confined within certain limits, and under certain\r\ncircumstances, may not be forbidden, this is not the case with\r\nmasturbation. This latter indulgence has nothing legitimate in it;\r\nand nothing respectable--nothing which can palliate the veto of the\r\nphysician. We are aware that onanism is not always necessarily followed\r\nby any inconvenience or danger; but, practically, this distinction\r\ndisappears. But onanism, without regard to the mode, its frequence, or\r\nthe individuals or circumstances under which it occurs, may always be\r\nconsidered an abuse, and, consequently, be earnestly proscribed.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject rests on two facts: one is fundamental,\r\nand applies to all individuals, without distinction of age, sex,\r\nor constitution; the other relates only to those who are addicted\r\nto onanism, before they are perfectly formed and constituted. The\r\nfirst of these motives is founded on this, that when this practice\r\nis not actually bad, it may constantly be suspected of becoming so.\r\nWhen onanism once commences, it is difficult to say how far it will\r\nextend. The taste for it, and the facility of indulging in it at night,\r\nand often in the day, cause this habit to be in a measure indulged\r\nin without limits. It becomes so soon imperious, and the despotism\r\nit exercises is so absolute, that we ought always to attempt its\r\nprevention. It should be regarded as a scourge, and be treated as\r\nsuch, without waiting for the bad effects which may result from it.\r\nThis course is still more necessary, when children, young patients,\r\nand individuals who have not attained their growth, are interested.\r\nWhen maturity arrives, the evil is possible; before it happens, it\r\nis probable, and often certain. Farther: our remarks on precocious\r\nenjoyments prevent our recurring to the subject.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the preservative means, a question presents itself.\r\nHow can it be told when these means may be used? or, in other words,\r\nwhat are the signs which indicate that an individual is an onanist, or\r\nmay become so? The suspicion may extend very far: in fact, every age is\r\nexposed to it, as onanism is possible from early life to old age: it,\r\nhowever, belongs to the age before puberty. A great many young girls\r\nand boys masturbate: hence, this maybe suspected of every one. This\r\nhabit is less frequent, but it is far from being rare. The precautions\r\nto prevent onanism, and constant vigilance, should then be exercised\r\nconstantly towards children and young people--in fact, towards all who\r\nare not of mature age. This rule is an important one; and cannot be\r\nneglected, without exposing one to danger and to deep regrets.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable to ascertain the existence of onanism before its\r\neffects appear; but this is seldom the case. There is in children a\r\nkind of instinct which leads them to conceal this manœuvre, although\r\nthey have not learned that it is an illicit act. The art with which\r\nthey elude vigilance is often inconceivable. Watch where the child\r\ngoes. Have an eye to him who seeks solitude--who remains a long time\r\nalone, and who cannot give a good account of himself. Be watchful\r\nabout the periods of lying down and of rising. At this time, the\r\nonanist may be detected in the act. His hands are never out of bed,\r\nand his face is often hidden under the bed-clothes. Soon after lying\r\ndown, he appears sound asleep: this circumstance, which always causes\r\ndistrust in the experienced man, is one of those which contribute the\r\nmost to inspire the parents with a feeling of security. The affectation\r\nof sleep in the young person may serve to detect him. When approached,\r\nhe is frequently found red, and covered with sweat, although neither\r\nthe temperature of the chamber, the weight of bed-clothes, nor any\r\nother cause, can explain this state: at the same time, the respiration\r\nis more hurried, the pulse is fuller, harder, and more frequent; the\r\nveins are larger, and the heat is greater, than usual; in fine, there\r\nis that kind of fever, of general turgescence, which usually attends\r\nthe act of venery.\r\n\r\nWhen the young person is disturbed suddenly, his hands, if he has not\r\nhad time to remove them, will be found on or near the genital organs.\r\nThe penis, also, may be found in a state of erection; or you may even\r\nfind marks of recent pollution, which might be known by the peculiar\r\nodor arising from the semen, and which comes from the soiled fingers.\r\nHave an eye to those young persons, whose hands, when in bed, or during\r\nsleep, are in the position described: they are onanists, or will\r\nbecome so. The same is true in those who frequently have erections\r\nof the penis. This erection, and this attitude, are certainly not\r\npositive signs of onanism; but they are the probable, or precursory\r\nsigns of it: they should not, then, be neglected. The stains of semen,\r\non the bed-clothes or dress, may also increase suspicion. When the\r\npatients are very young, they are not very evident, the fluid which\r\nthey emit not having the characters of real semen: the traces which\r\nit leaves, however, are too remarkable, not to cause suspicion as to\r\ntheir origin. In those who have attained the age of puberty, there\r\nwould be nothing equivocal: the only question then would be, that they\r\nmight be produced by involuntary pollution. On this topic, we would\r\nremark, that this pollution seldom occurs before the age of fifteen or\r\nsixteen years, and is seldom frequent before twenty. When involuntary\r\ndischarges of semen are frequent in young persons, you may be assured\r\nthat they are the indirect results of onanism: hence, there is reason\r\nto regard stains of semen as positive proofs of onanism, when the\r\npatients have not attained the age of puberty; and as more probable\r\nsigns of this habit, when older, if these stains be frequent.\r\n\r\nA loss of color, or an earthy tint of the countenance--a violet\r\nappearance of the eyelids--a languid expression of face--an air\r\nof fatigue and _nonchalance_, when the patient rises from bed--a\r\ndifficulty in getting up--are all signs which may lead to the discovery\r\nof this pernicious habit. Here we might trace the physical state\r\nproduced by onanism, if this had not already been done. Unfortunately,\r\nit is consumption which sounds the alarm; and this disease must be\r\nadvanced, too, before the parents seek the cause. Sometimes, the true\r\ncause is overlooked, and all remedies are directed to an imaginary one.\r\nWe will admit, however, that it is not always easy to refer the wasting\r\ncaused by masturbation to its real origin. A young man, although not\r\naddicted to onanism, may lose his strength, grow thin, and present,\r\nboth morally and physically, the characters belonging to this habit:\r\nthis effect is often produced by intestinal worms, by dentition,\r\npuberty, by a too rapid growth of the body, &c.; and likewise by some\r\nchronic diseases of the stomach, intestines, liver, lungs, heart, &c.\r\nHence, we should not be too quick to attribute to masturbation a state\r\nwhich may be produced by other causes. The practitioner who would\r\npronounce too precipitately that a patient indulged in onanism, would\r\ncommit an error which might be serious in more than one respect.\r\n\r\nWhen a young patient presents signs of consumption, there is cause\r\nto suspect that onanism is the cause of it; and modes may be used to\r\nascertain whether this be the case. Sometimes, the patient is watched,\r\nas has already been stated. Sometimes, we attempt to discover if\r\nany other cause has produced consumption; and when this cause is not\r\nfound, the existence of onanism is supposed. The patient, for instance,\r\npresents all the symptoms of exhaustion, and these increase. We inquire\r\nif this state may not result from a want of nourishment, or from\r\nimproper food--from hard work--from long watching--from melancholy,\r\n&c.; if it may not be caused by a disease about which the patient is\r\nsilent, or by one of those maladies which produce effects similar to\r\nthose of masturbation. Now, if the gradual sinkings of the patient\r\ncannot be explained by any of these causes; if he is weak, pale, thin,\r\n&c.; if, notwithstanding abundant and nutritious diet, a moderate\r\ndegree of labor, the absence of all chagrin, &c.; if he presents no\r\nsign of disease--or, rather, if the first symptoms of diseases which\r\nhe would present are not manifested until after the appearance of\r\nthose of consumption; farther, if these diseases are too slight to\r\nhave caused this state; if they cannot explain the numerous and varied\r\nsymptoms observed, and particularly the countenance, the character of\r\nwhich is so significant, that it alone often reveals onanism: then we\r\nmay consider, if not as certain, at least as very probable, that the\r\npatient is a victim to this habit, and we must act accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut, of all the proofs, it is most important to obtain an avowal of\r\nthe habit from the patient. First, it removes all doubt; then it\r\nrenders the action of the physician more frank, and consequently more\r\nefficacious. He is no longer fearful of wounding his feelings--of\r\ncompromising his character, by showing a wrongly founded suspicion;\r\nof awaking the attention of the young patient to a subject of which\r\nhe was ignorant, or of teaching it to him. Advice, remonstrances,\r\npunishments, and all the moral remedies, are now easily applicable; and\r\nif therapeutic or coercive measures are called for, the patient can no\r\nlonger deny their utility, and reject their use. Finally, an avowal\r\nplaces the physician, parents, instructors--in short, all who have\r\nauthority over the patient--in a position to proceed directly to their\r\naim, and thereby attain it.\r\n\r\nAn avowal never takes place spontaneously: to obtain it is difficult.\r\nWith males, one need not be so particular; but we must be careful with\r\nfemales. On this topic, no positive advice can be given: much must\r\nbe left to the _tact_ of the practitioner. We will only add, that we\r\nhave more than once simply given advice; and we could see, from the\r\nmanner in which it was received, that our conjectures were right. The\r\nphysician, however, should always attempt to acquire the confidence\r\nof the onanist, to place him at his ease. They have no frankness when\r\na person is stern, or when a moral lecture is expected. The physician\r\nshould confine himself to his profession. In his eye, onanism should\r\nbe regarded as a cause of disease--as a cause similar to an excess\r\nof labor, bad regimen--in fact, like any influence which might prove\r\ninjurious to the health. If he should moralize, he would probably be\r\ndebarred from that confidence which would enable him to give advice,\r\nand prescribe the resources of the art.\r\n\r\nMasturbation is often overlooked, because it is thought that the hand\r\nis a necessary agent in producing it: this is far from being the\r\ncase; as it may be indulged in, by both sexes, without the aid of the\r\nhands. When this is suspected, it is soon discovered, by the manners,\r\nface, and silence of the onanist: there is something unusual in the\r\nappearance of the patient, which is readily observed; and generally,\r\nalso, the thighs are crossed, or, at least, are pressed closely\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the development of the habit, and, when it is developed,\r\nto arrest it, are the two indications prescribed by hygeia. These two\r\nindications may be embraced in one--that of _preventing_ the occurrence\r\nof onanism. If, for instance, you have before you the case of two\r\nindividuals, one of whom is not addicted to onanism, while the other\r\nmay be, you should _prevent_ one from continuing, and the other from\r\ncommencing it. In the two cases, the means used have the same tendency;\r\nonly when you wish to prevent the habit commenced, you have need of\r\nmore efforts than in the first case, where it does not exist. These\r\nmeans are, then, preventive--essentially preventive; for, whatever may\r\nbe their mode of action, they all tend to prevent the act. Although\r\nthe prevention of onanism, and the arrest of the habit, are apparently\r\ndifferent, yet we shall state the mode of attaining this double result,\r\nto avoid repetitions.\r\n\r\nIn masturbation, we must consider three things--the desire, the will,\r\nand the power. Onanism is not possible, where these three conditions\r\ndo not exist: there is no wish without desire; and the latter is often\r\ncompletely mastered by the former, and both present no result, if there\r\nbe no possibility of indulging. Hence, to prevent masturbation, and to\r\narrest it, the desire, the wish, the power to indulge, must not exist.\r\nThese are, as it has been seen, three distinct indications. It is\r\nsufficient to attain one of them. It is easily seen, that by appeasing\r\nthe desire, the will is aided; and the obstacles opposed would be more\r\nefficacious, the less vivid the desire, and the weaker the will. It is,\r\ntherefore, sufficiently understood, that the three indications we have\r\nmentioned, although very distinct, require each of them special means,\r\nthe attainment of one of which renders that of the others useless,\r\nwhile they all can and may be pursued conjointly.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. FIRST INDICATION. TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF THE DESIRE TO\r\nMASTURBATE, TO PREVENT ITS RETURN, AND TO ABRIDGE ITS POWER.\r\n\r\nThe desire of masturbation is very distinct from venereal desires,\r\nwhich may be felt without experiencing the other. This desire is\r\nspecial: it is that of onanism, and no other. The influences, also--the\r\nresult of which is more or less proximate, and which is to excite the\r\ngenital sense--are only the _indirect_ and _predisposing_ causes of\r\nonanism. The direct and efficient causes are those which lead to the\r\nindulgence of it, and the preferring of it to coition. Consequently,\r\ntwo indications relate to the desire of masturbation: one consists in\r\npreventing the exaltation of the venereal sense, or in appeasing it;\r\nand the second, in preventing or destroying the special causes of\r\nthe desire of onanism. We proceed to study these two indications in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n1. _Rules relative to the general or indirect causes of onanism._--The\r\ngenital sense, and, consequently, the venereal desires, may be felt too\r\nvividly and too early, in consequence of different circumstances, which\r\nmay be divided into two groups. Some belong to the human body, and\r\nconsist in certain innate acquired arrangements of the organization,\r\nin consequence of which the venereal sense presents more or less\r\nsusceptibility. Others consist in different influences, as education,\r\nfood, climate, kind of life, &c.; which may act on the sensibility in\r\ngeneral, and particularly on that of the genital system. We will begin\r\nwith the rules connected with the former.\r\n\r\n_Of the innate or acquired causes of venereal excitement, and of the\r\nrules of preservation connected with them._--Some individuals seem, as\r\nit were, marked by their organization, to become victims of venereal\r\nexcesses. In them, the genital sense is excited, and exercises great\r\npower, long before the usual period of its manifestation. In others,\r\non the contrary, this sense is not excited until late: in fact, it is\r\nso slight, that even this excitement may be doubted. In the present\r\nstate of the science, these differences can by no means be accounted\r\nfor. In many cases, however the great development of certain organs,\r\nthe increase of their vitality or their diseased state exercise\r\nconsiderable influence on the strength and precocity of the venereal\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nGall, and the phrenologists of his school, place amativeness in the\r\ncerebellum. They consider this organ as the legislator of the sexual\r\nparts, the seat of physical love; and assert that the differences in\r\nthe mass and vitality of this portion of the brain, correspond exactly\r\nto the differences of the intensity of the genital desires. We will\r\nproceed to mention the different facts on which these physiologists\r\nformed their opinion.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomy furnishes them with no argument worthy of mention:\r\nin fine, facts contradictory to Gall’s opinion may be derived from\r\nnumerous classes of animals who have been deprived of their cerebellum,\r\nand yet have exercised the act of reproduction. This opinion applies\r\nonly to man, and the mammalia resembling him. The relation between\r\nthe development of the cerebellum and that of the genital organs, has\r\nfurnished a more plausible reason: it has been adduced as an argument,\r\nthat, in the encephalon, the fibres of the cerebellum are the last to\r\nappear distinctly; and this organ is not perfect, till from the age of\r\neighteen to twenty-six years. A remark of Sœmmering, also, has been\r\nadduced, to show that the cerebellum, at the period of puberty, is to\r\nthe cerebrum as one to five, while in infancy it is only as one to\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the genital sense is more powerful in males\r\nthan in females. But it is said positively, that the cerebellum is\r\ncommonly smaller in females than in males.\r\n\r\nPhrenologists have also sought to establish a reciprocity of action\r\nbetween the genital organs and the cerebellum, by means of the results\r\nof castration, and also the influence which the development of the\r\ncerebellum may have on the testicles. Castration, (say they,) while it\r\nopposes the development of the sense of venery, prevents the cerebellum\r\nfrom gaining the size it would otherwise have attained. Observe, too,\r\nhow much broader the neck in the bull is, than in the ox. They have\r\nalso advanced, that if castration occurs only at a period when the\r\ncerebellum acquires its development, the genital sense may survive this\r\noperation; that, in some cases, it may reduce this organ to a state\r\napproximating atrophy; that the removal of one testicle from an animal,\r\nwhatever may be its species, may produce atrophy, or some alteration\r\nin the lobe of the cerebellum, on the side opposite to the testicle\r\nremoved. They have added, that the alteration of the cerebellum had\r\ncaused a wasting of the testicles; and that, in the cases where one\r\nof the lobes only was disorganized, the testicle of the opposite side\r\nwas alone affected. According to Gall and his disciples, the size of\r\nthe cerebellum is discerned externally by the size and breadth of\r\nthe nucha. They remark, that this part of the skull is generally more\r\nconvex in males than in females--in entire animals, than in those\r\nwho have been castrated--in early life, and in those individuals who\r\nare distinguished for their salacity, more than in those who are not\r\nsusceptible to the pleasures of love. Larrey pointed out to Gall a\r\nsoldier, whose antipathy to females amounted to mania: the sight of a\r\nfemale caused in him violent convulsions, and almost fury. Spurzheim\r\nsaw a similar instance in England. Now, in both of these individuals,\r\nthe cerebellum was but slightly developed. The portraits of Newton,\r\nCharles XII., and Kant, according to Gall, by the narrowness of the\r\nneck, show that the organ of which we were speaking was but slightly\r\ndeveloped in these great men, who history states had but little relish\r\nfor venereal pleasures. Dispositions diametrically opposite, on the\r\ncontrary, co-exist with an enlarged volume of the brain. The following\r\nis related by Gall:--\r\n\r\n“A highly intellectual lady was affected from infancy with very\r\npassionate desires; and her careful education alone saved her from\r\nthose excesses to which she was exposed by her violent temperament.\r\nWhen arrived at a more advanced age, she was left to herself. She\r\nattempted every mode to satisfy her burning passions; but enjoyment\r\nseemed only to irritate her. She was frequently almost in a state of\r\nmania. In despair, she left her house, quitted the city, and took\r\nrefuge with her mother, in a desolate country, where the want of\r\nexciting objects, and the utmost severity, and the cares of gardening,\r\nprevented the evil. After a time, she returned again to a large city,\r\nwas again threatened with relapse, and took refuge a second time with\r\nher mother. On returning, she came to see me at Paris, and complained\r\nto me in great despair. ‘On every side, I see images of luxury--in\r\nevery place--at table, and even in my sleep, the demon pursues me. I\r\nshall either be mad, or die.’\r\n\r\n“I told her briefly the natural history of the instinct of propagation.\r\nI called her attention to the form of her neck. Although her head was\r\nvery large, yet the diameter of the nucha exceeded the distance from\r\near to ear. She formed an idea of the cause of her state. I advised her\r\nto visit her mother again; to vary her occupations, so as to diminish\r\nthe activity of her cerebellum; to apply leeches to the nucha, to\r\ndiminish the irritation of this organ; to avoid all stimulating meats\r\nand drinks, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n“I have seen at Paris,” says the same author, “a boy, five years old,\r\nwho seemed sixteen, in respect to his corporeal strength. His genital\r\norgans were perfectly developed; his beard was strong; his voice was\r\nrough and hoarse: in short, he presented all the signs of virility.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gall was struck, also, with the development of the cerebellum in a\r\nboy ten years old, who had been detained in a house of correction at\r\nLeipzick, for having violated a young girl. He had also seen at Paris\r\na young mulatto, less than three years old, who was remarkable in the\r\nsame respect. He made advances, not only to young girls, but to women,\r\nand urged them to consent to his desires. His sexual organs, with the\r\nexception of long-continued erections, exhibited nothing remarkable.\r\nAs he was surrounded by girls who indulged him, he died of consumption\r\nbefore he was five years old. His cerebellum was unusually developed;\r\nthe rest of the head was of the common size. Gall has related other\r\ninstances of the kind.\r\n\r\nA case published by Dr. Chauffard, of Avignon, deserves to be stated\r\nhere. This physician accompanied the prefect in 1823, in his tour to\r\nthe departments, to examine those young men who wished to be discharged\r\nfrom military service. A stout farmer, with coarse beard and hair, and\r\ndisagreeable odor, was undressed, being, as it was said, affected with\r\na disease which he dared not name. It was at the close of December; the\r\nseason was cold, and the room very chilly. No sooner was he undressed,\r\nthan the penis began to swell. He was confused--he blushed--he turned\r\nhis back to the assistants. He could not avoid the priapism; nor,\r\nfinally, an emission of semen, which took place without a sensible\r\ndiminution in the size of this organ. This man was ignorant and stupid,\r\nbut he answered questions correctly. He said he was always tormented\r\nby continual erections, often followed by seminal emissions. He even\r\nadmitted that he was accustomed to solicit them. His neck was short;\r\nbroad, and thick; the posterior portion of the occipital bone presented\r\na very marked slope: finally, the cerebellar portion of the cranium\r\nwas very prominent, and much developed. This man was reformed. (_Jour.\r\nuniv. des Sc. Med._, December, 1828.) We have also observed a very\r\nremarkable development of the posterior part of the skull, in a boy\r\neight years old, who was addicted to masturbation for several years,\r\nand whose penis was almost constantly in a state of erection. This\r\nprominence so elongated the antero posterior diameter of the cranium,\r\nthat the mother found it difficult to fit caps to his head.\r\n\r\nOne of Gall’s most distinguished pupils, Dr. Voisin, has tested\r\nphrenology, in a visit recently made to the convict galley, at Toulon.\r\nRenaud, the Director, informed of the scientific purpose of the\r\nvisit of this physician, allowed him to examine the cerebral organs\r\nof 350 thieves, forgers, or homicides; among whom he had designedly\r\ndistributed 22 other convicts, condemned for rape, requesting M. Voisin\r\nto discover them from this number, by examining the posterior part of\r\nthe head. This gentleman picked out 22, 13 of whom only were condemned\r\nfor violence. Thus, then, he had selected nine who were not guilty of\r\nthis crime; and, on the contrary, had allowed to escape him nine who\r\nhad been committed. Now, the nine wrongly selected were libertines,\r\nwhom the Director admitted required to be constantly watched; and\r\nthe nine, on the contrary, whom he had not detected, were guilty\r\nby accident, or when intoxicated: with them, libertinism was only\r\naccidental, and not organic.\r\n\r\nA few experimental proofs have been invoked, in support of Gall’s\r\nopinions of the cerebellum. We will cite a remark made by Serres, as\r\nto those bulls killed by striking them on the back of the neck. “The\r\npenis, in those where the cerebellum was injured, oscillated very\r\nevidently during the experiment.” The same gentleman observed a very\r\nmarked erection in a young horse, who was killed by plunging a knife\r\ninto the cerebellum. Segalas has produced the same effect in Guinea\r\npigs, by pushing a stylet into this organ.\r\n\r\nThe principal proofs, however, have been drawn from the action of the\r\ndiseased cerebellum on the genital apparatus. Thus, the erection of\r\nthe penis in those who die by hanging, has been attributed, by Gall,\r\nto the affection of the cerebellum in this kind of death. Cruvelhier\r\nhas contested this explanation. He thinks it may be explained by the\r\nstasis of the venous blood. “Respiration,” says he, “is retarded, in\r\nconsequence of the medulla oblongata; and hence results a semi-asphyxic\r\nstate, favorable to erection. In hanging, there may be an affection of\r\nthe cervical part of the medulla; and priapism has been observed more\r\nthan once in lesions of this part.” Phrenologists have also shown, that\r\nthis symptom often follows the application of a blister or seton to the\r\nneck. Another fact, to show the connection of the cerebellum with the\r\ngenital apparatus, is that of a soldier, whose generative powers had\r\ndisappeared, after the fleshy scalp of the occiput had been removed\r\nby the blow of a sabre. We doubt whether similar cases to this, which\r\nwas observed by Larry, have often occurred; although Dr. Bischoff has\r\nadvanced, that wounds of the back of the head, and blows on this part,\r\nhave often been followed by inflammation of the genitals.\r\n\r\nPeculiar excitement of these organs has more than once attended a\r\ndisease of the cerebellum. We have already mentioned this fact; and\r\nthe cases stated were selected as those where the affection of the\r\ncerebellum might be considered as produced by venereal excesses. In\r\nthose now to be mentioned, the genital excitement is, or seems to be,\r\nthe consequence of this affection.\r\n\r\nErection of the penis, with or without pollutions, has several\r\ntimes been noticed as a symptom of apoplexy of the cerebellum. This\r\nphenomenon may have been observed in some cases of this affection\r\nwhich we have cited. Serres was the first one to call attention to\r\nthis phenomenon, in his Memoir on Apoplexy of the Cerebellum, inserted\r\nin the Journal of Experimental Physiology; the principal facts of which\r\nhave been adduced in his work on the comparative anatomy of the brain.\r\nOne fact is, that of a man, forty-six years old, who died with violent\r\napoplexy of the cerebellum, during which satyriasis and ejaculation\r\nappeared, with swelling of all the genital organs. Similar cases,\r\nwhich it is unnecessary to state here, might be added. One of them was\r\nobserved by Falret. “The priapism was presented to my observation with\r\na very remarkable circumstance. The patient had been affected with\r\napoplexy, and presented a complete paralysis of the left side of the\r\nbody. Different nervous symptoms indicated that there was also great\r\nirritation of the encephalon or its membranes. This man, although\r\nhalf frantic, made amorous proposals to the female who attended him,\r\nand presented a semi-erection of the penis: this part, instead of\r\nbeing straight, presented a concavity, which looked towards the side\r\nnot paralyzed. I regret that I could not examine the cadaver of this\r\nindividual. The affection of the genital organs, in apoplexies of the\r\ncerebellum, might probably have been noticed in many cases, if it had\r\nbeen sought after.” It has not been noted, in any of the cases analyzed\r\nby Andral. Cruvelhier, also, has never noticed priapism, in a case of\r\napoplexy of the cerebellum which he has seen; but he adds, that he\r\nwould not dare to say that it has never existed--at least, temporarily.\r\nIn fact, it may easily escape observation.\r\n\r\nHydrocephalic patients often show a great passion for venereal\r\nindulgences. Gall, in noticing this remark, observes, that of all\r\nthe parts of the encephalon, this is the least changed in these\r\nindividuals. Chauffard has seen a hydrocephalic patient, fourteen\r\nto fifteen years old, with an enormous head, who was addicted to\r\nmasturbation, and spoke of the pleasures he derived from it.\r\n\r\nAn acute or chronic irritation of the cerebellum, or of its envelopes,\r\nmay cause venereal symptoms more than the alterations just mentioned.\r\nIn a cadaver, brought from the hospital Bicetre to the amphitheatre,\r\nwhere the penis and testes were considerably swelled, the whole of the\r\ncerebellum was inflamed. One of the most interesting facts of this\r\nkind was reported by Chauffard. It was that of a man, fifty-three\r\nyears old, of pleasant manners and mild character, who, in falling,\r\nstruck his head against the bed-post. The inferior occipital region\r\nbecame inflamed; and subsequently, the habits of the patient were much\r\nchanged: he became affected with satyriasis, and was so salacious,\r\nthat he persecuted his wife and daughter, and all the females around\r\nhim. This man, hitherto pious and modest, gradually became affected\r\nwith the most violent erotic delirium, and finally committed the most\r\nindecent acts. During the next three months, this state increased;\r\nbut, at the same time, his strength and intelligence failed. Finally,\r\none day, after a violent fit of anger, occasioned by the refusal of\r\nhis wife to listen to him, he became convulsed. The pain left the back\r\npart of the head, and affected the top of it. The left side of the\r\nbody now began to be paralyzed; and the satyriasis was replaced by\r\nreligious delirium, with constant mumbling of prayers. The patient died\r\neight days afterward. According to Chauffard, at first, there was an\r\naffection of the cerebellum. When the state of the patient was changed,\r\nthe organ of veneration was affected: this organ corresponds to the\r\ncentral posterior and superior part of the frontal bone, where the\r\npatient finally felt severe pain.\r\n\r\nWas not the cerebellum, also, affected, in the following case reported\r\nby Sainte Marie:--“A merchant of Lyons, an educated and honorable man,\r\nseemed to be cured of an inveterate venereal affection, for which\r\nhe had undergone a course of treatment with mercury. He, however,\r\ncomplained of restlessness, heat in the throat, _pains in the occiput\r\nand nucha_, and frequent erections. In 1812, after domestic troubles,\r\nhe became affected with furious delirium. This state lasted three days,\r\nand terminated in priapism; during which, the patient had fourteen\r\nemissions in a few hours. This singular crisis resulted in a perfect\r\ncalm: extreme debility, however, remained, which soon yielded to\r\ntonics and analeptics. Two years and a half afterward, this disease\r\nreappeared, under the influence of these same causes, and with similar\r\nsymptoms. The termination was the same. There was a slight return of\r\nit after two years; but, this time, the patient escaped with slight\r\nerections, without much loss of semen.”\r\n\r\nFacts of a similar character have induced several authors to attribute\r\nsatyriasis and nymphomania exclusively to an innate or accidental\r\nstate of the cerebellum. “The material condition of satyriasis,” says\r\nVoisin, “resides in the encephalon; and in all cases, the deranged\r\nmanifestation of it depends on the nature and preponderating power of\r\nthe cerebellum, or on those moral and intellectual causes which have\r\nfavored the development of this organ--or, rather, on the external\r\ncircumstances which at the moment of disease have brought it violently\r\ninto action.” On the other hand, the localization of physical love in\r\nthe cerebellum has been violently contested by excellent observers,\r\nparticularly by Flourens and Bouillaud, who consider as the special\r\nfunction of this organ its presidence over locomotion. Bouillaud,\r\nparticularly, has attempted to establish, by analyzing the observations\r\nof Gall and Serres, that they are not so conclusive as these authors\r\nasserted, and that they may be interpreted differently. Chauffard\r\nthinks that Gall has gone too far, and that his remark, that physical\r\nlove and erections should not be attributed to the presence of the\r\nsemen and the irritation which it causes, should be qualified by using\r\nthe term _exclusively_. We also think, that, thus altered, Gall’s\r\nremark would be more just. The cerebellum has certainly a powerful\r\naction on salacity; but we shall see that each part of the genital\r\napparatus exercises one equally great; and that, consequently, the\r\norganic principle of the state of rutting, and of venereal excesses,\r\ncannot be sought for solely in the encephalon.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Gall’s opinions, many authors, among whom we will\r\nmention Chauffard, Voisin, and Londe, have thought it necessary, in\r\norder to subdue too great a degree of amativeness, to make applications\r\ndirectly to the cerebellum. Some attempts have seemed to justify\r\nthis view of the subject. Sainte Marie says, that a physician of\r\nLyons has cured inveterate nocturnal pollutions, by applying ice to\r\nthe occiput and nucha before going to bed. A man, thirty years old,\r\nhad three or four seminal emissions every night, which Lallemand had\r\ntried in vain to cure, by cauterizing the ejaculatory canals. Gensoult\r\napplied leeches and ice to the nucha: the pollutions were arrested,\r\nas if by magic. Serres, who reports this case, adds, that, since the\r\npublication of his memoir on cerebellar apoplexy, he has seen two cases\r\nof apoplexy, where erections appeared during the paroxysms. Both were\r\ncured by applying leeches and emollient cataplasms to the nucha. Might\r\nnot narcotics be applied, endermically, near the cerebellum, to subdue\r\nthe onanistic satyriasis? Might not belladonna, opium, &c., introduced\r\nin this manner, be used with advantage? Might not, also, the hair of\r\nthe head be kept short, especially behind, and rest on a pillow of\r\nhair, instead of feathers? Setons and blisters, also, should be applied\r\nto the neck, in onanists, only with the utmost care; and they should\r\nbe removed as soon as they are considered indispensable. Besides the\r\nirritation caused near the cerebellum, the influence of the cantharides\r\nis to be guarded against.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, that there is a reciprocity of action between\r\ndifferent organs: if there be one which exercises a marked influence\r\non the other, the latter will in turn affect the former. This may be\r\nproved by the cerebellum, which sometimes becomes diseased after abuses\r\nof the genital organs, and sometimes communicates to these organs the\r\nover-excitement which is accidentally seated in it: the spinal marrow,\r\nalso, confirms the fact.\r\n\r\nWillis, who, before Gall, had sought to localize in the nervous centres\r\nthe faculty of reproduction, had designated the spinal marrow as the\r\norgan of this faculty. Numerous observations, and many experiments,\r\nhave lately given some credit to this opinion. Segalas, who produced\r\nerections of the penis in Guinea pigs, by introducing a stylet into\r\nthe cerebellum, caused ejaculations by pushing this instrument into\r\nthe spinal column, near the lumbar region. Serres repeated this last\r\nexperiment, and the result was similar: he therefore concluded that the\r\nlower part of the spinal marrow acts on the secretory and excreting\r\nseminal apparatus, as the cerebellum acts on the genital sense. We\r\nshall see, also, that this opinion is too positive, as the lesions of\r\nthe medulla exert a marked action on erection of the penis and the\r\nvenereal sense, besides the influence on the ejaculation attributed to\r\nit by Serres.\r\n\r\nA case, reported by Lenhossek, seems to establish, that compression and\r\natrophy of the spinal marrow may oppose the development of the genital\r\norgans. This patient was twenty-four years old: he was thin, wasted,\r\nand his height was that of an individual twelve years of age. Neither\r\nhis face nor genital system presented the characters of puberty. This\r\nindividual died suddenly; and it was found, that in consequence of a\r\nmalformation of the first and second cervical vertebræ, the diameter of\r\nthe occipital foramen was contracted one half. The medulla oblongata\r\nhad been compressed in this part, and its development was impeded.\r\nMight not the singular disease, observed by Larrey in Egypt, and\r\nafterward in Paris, be referred to an affection of the spinal marrow?\r\nHere the testicles gradually wasted; the patient lost the power of\r\nfeeling venereal sensations, and also that of erections; the lower\r\nextremities shrunk away, and tottered; the face was discolored; the\r\ndigestive powers and intellectual faculties were deranged. Does not\r\nthis coincidence, of a considerable weakening of the lower extremities\r\nand the wasting of the testicles, indicate that this latter has been\r\nthe consequence of an affection of the spinal marrow?\r\n\r\nDupuytren long since established the fact, that priapism was caused\r\nby a lesion of this organ. Numerous instances of this are found in\r\nOlivier’s work on the spinal marrow: they prove, that every part of\r\nthe medulla, but particularly the cervical portion, when injured, may\r\ncause an erection of the penis. Potain, Renauldin, and Hedelhofer, have\r\nstated similar facts. This last author saw a man who fell upon his\r\nsacrum, and instantly had an emission. Professor Fages was in the habit\r\nof mentioning the following case in his lectures:--“An aid-de-camp of\r\nGeneral Dumourier was affected with complete paralysis of the lower\r\nextremities, in consequence of a fall from his horse. This paralysis\r\nwas attended with a great degree of priapism, which encumbered him\r\nvery much, and caused retentions of urine, which were treated by the\r\nmost active refrigerants. Going through Montpelier, on his way to\r\nBalaruc, he rested several days at the military hospital, where it\r\nbecame expedient to sound him. In order to do this, it was necessary\r\nto uncover the whole body, to expose it for some time to the cold air,\r\nand to apply to it cold water; and, even then, the sound had to be used\r\npromptly, otherwise erections would soon have supervened, merely by\r\ntouching the penis, and by the presence of the sound in the urethra.\r\nThe baths of Balaruc almost cured the paralysis; and as motion returned\r\nto the lower extremities, the priapism disappeared.”\r\n\r\nDo not these facts show that the spinal marrow has a marked influence\r\non the genital organs. We have already mentioned the opinion of Sainte\r\nMarie, who regards involuntary pollutions as sometimes the cause and\r\nsometimes the result of affections of the spinal marrow. May not an\r\noriginal or accidental state of this organ be, in some subjects,\r\nthe indirect cause of venereal excesses? Remark the influence of a\r\nrecumbent position, in producing voluptuous dreams and emissions of\r\nsemen. Does not this singular effect depend on the heat of the spinal\r\nmarrow caused by this position? This is possible, particularly if you\r\nconsider the advantages derived in involuntary pollution, priapism,\r\nand satyriasis, from douches of cold water along the vertebral\r\ncolumn, particularly on the lumbar and sacral regions, and also from\r\nthe application of ice to these parts. Sainte Marie has sometimes\r\narrested the spasm of the genital organs by frictions on the sacrum\r\nwith bladders full of ice. We think, then, there are cases where these\r\nremedies may be used successfully to combat the habit of masturbation.\r\nNarcotic frictions and endermic applications may be made along the\r\nvertebral column, as we have said, when speaking of the cerebellum. In\r\nvigorous patients, leeches and cups may be applied to the loins. We\r\nwill not allude here to the remedy recommended by many old authors, of\r\na sheet of lead to the kidneys, for this cannot produce the refrigerant\r\neffect expected from it.\r\n\r\nThe organic conditions of venereal desire are confined neither to the\r\ncerebellum nor spinal marrow: they may exist, also, in all parts of the\r\ngenital system, as we shall demonstrate.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of this system is formed of a tissue termed the\r\n_erectile_, on account of its power of swelling, hardening, and\r\nbecoming erected. It constitutes the whole of the cavernous bodies--the\r\nglans, which is the loose extremity of these bodies--the spongy part of\r\nthe urethra--the clitoris--and a considerable portion of the vulva and\r\nvagina. The part taken by this tissue in the work of generation, would\r\nindicate that it is affected in amatory desires, and that its state\r\nmust exercise some influence upon them; which is demonstrated by the\r\nfacts we shall mention.\r\n\r\nThere is no vice in the human species without its representative in\r\nsome class of animals. Thus, the inclination to theft, to destroy,\r\n&c., are found in some species existing to a great degree. So, too,\r\nwith luxuriousness. There is a class of apes--the dog-faced--which\r\nrepresent it. It is impossible to form an idea of the lasciviousness\r\nof these animals, which is manifested at sight not only of a female\r\nof their own class, but at that of a woman: they show by their looks,\r\ngesture, and voice, that they are excited. They are extremely jealous\r\nat sight of a man. They indulge in coition to great excess; and if\r\nthis be impossible, they abuse themselves. How does their organization\r\ndiffer from that of other animals?--in the cerebellum?--in the spinal\r\nmarrow? No: but according to Desmoulins, by the enormous mass of\r\nerectile tissue which they have. This tissue abounds not only around\r\nthe sexual organs, but is found in the haunches and pubis. In the face,\r\nit is not confined as in us to the lips, but it covers the face, and\r\nthere presents a brilliancy of color which exceeds that of the vulva\r\nand glans in our species. It should be remembered that the kunocephali\r\ndo not exhibit this lasciviousness until puberty, when this tissue is\r\ndeveloped, and assumes its brilliant colors.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are animals, in whom the erectile tissue evidently performs\r\nthe part attributed by phrenologists exclusively to the cerebellum.\r\nWhy may not the same thing exist in our species? Are not the penis\r\nand clitoris, generally speaking, much larger in those who have a\r\nmarked propensity for the pleasures of love? Is not their erection the\r\nmost constant sign of the activity of the venereal sense? Is not the\r\nerectile tissue developed at puberty, at the same time with this sense,\r\nand does it not collapse in old age? Finally, does not the genital\r\nsense exist at its highest degree in the glans--the clitoris--that is,\r\nin the organs formed entirely of this tissue?\r\n\r\nThere is, then, reason to seek the principle of masturbation in this\r\ntissue, and to this remedies should be applied. This is done in a\r\nvigorous and healthy patient by blood-letting, and by applying leeches\r\nor cups around the sexual parts. Lotions and cold applications to these\r\nparts, and cold hip-baths, act in the same manner; and as they do\r\nnot contribute to the exhaustion, they are employed more frequently.\r\nSainte Marie recommends that the genital organs of individuals affected\r\nwith spermatorrhœa should be covered with bladders of pounded ice,\r\nwhich should be removed as often as it melts. This remedy seems more\r\nefficacious and convenient than the application of wet sponges or\r\nlinens to the parts. It might also be used in those onanists who will\r\nconsent to it. The same indication is fulfilled by forbidding children\r\nto be washed in warm water, and by causing them to use hard cushions\r\nto sit on; and likewise, by keeping the pelvis lightly covered, and the\r\nclothes large enough to allow the air to circulate freely around the\r\ngenital organs. The cold injections, in girls, may also be somewhat\r\nuseful. There is also another remedy which is applicable to parts\r\nformed of erectile tissue, and which we shall mention--viz., their\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nSome nations are accustomed to practise upon their female children\r\na kind of circumcision, which consists in cutting off several parts\r\nof the vulva. This custom is very ancient, and exists particularly\r\nin Egypt, Ethiopia, around the Persian Gulf, and in several parts of\r\ncentral Africa. What portions of the vulva are cut off? Many authors\r\nthink that these are the nympbæ, clitoris, and even the hymen. In fact,\r\nNiebuhr has given a colored plate of the sexual organs of an Egyptian\r\ngirl, eighteen years old, drawn by the painter Baurenfiend, the\r\noriginal of which is in the library at Gottingen, in which the parts\r\njust named seem to have been extirpated. Sonnini, who has examined two\r\nyoung Egyptian girls, one of whom had been circumcised for two years,\r\nwhile the operation was performed on the other in his presence, states,\r\ncontrary to Niebuhr’s opinion, that this operation has reference to\r\nthe interior of the vulva, and is confined to the excision of a thick,\r\nflabby, and fleshy excrescence, covered with skin, which in several\r\nAfrican races rises above the commissure of the external labia; the\r\nlength of this was only six lines, in the two girls observed by him,\r\nbut it may be four inches long, at the age of twenty-five years. As the\r\nopinion of Niebuhr agrees with that of all authors who have lived in\r\nthese countries, the facts observed by Sonnini are exceptions, rather\r\nthan the rule. Hence, it appears, that in many nations it is the custom\r\nto remove from the females a considerable portion of the erectile\r\ntissue, which is found around their sexual organs.\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin of this singular custom? Is it to remove in infancy,\r\nfrom the vulva of the girls, certain prominences which, at a later\r\nperiod, might prove inconvenient? Has this custom been established\r\nwith a view to cleanliness? May it not be, to take away the power of\r\nself-abuse? Whatever may be the reason of its existence, its effect is\r\nto deaden the venereal sense, by removing a portion of the surfaces\r\nin which it is situated. This seems positively established, by the\r\ntestimony of Niebuhr, and many others.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, may not the removal of the internal labia and of the\r\npreputial portion of the clitoris--especially if these parts are\r\nlarge--be attempted, in order to avoid a more extreme thing, which\r\nwe shall mention directly. Might not this removal blunt, if it did\r\nnot deaden, the propensity to solitary enjoyments, and render the\r\nother remedies employed more efficient? Although we have but little\r\nconfidence in this operation, yet, when we consider that a superficial\r\ncauterization of the nymphæ and clitoris has cured nymphomania, as\r\nwill be stated hereafter, we can conceive that the excision of the\r\ninternal labia may in some ca«es present a chance of success. Farther:\r\nthis operation is not very painful--is easily performed--and cannot,\r\neven under the least favorable circumstances, be attended with any\r\ninconvenience, except that of being useless. It certainly would not be\r\npractised generally if it caused severe pains, or was followed by bad\r\nconsequences. In Africa, it is performed by the females of Said, who\r\nuse a razor. And it should be remembered, too, that it is not children\r\nwho submit to this operation; but girls eight or ten years old, as may\r\nbe seen in the travels of Niebuhr and Sonnini.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite sensibility of the clitoris, and the size it commonly\r\npresents in lascivious females--that which it acquires in those who\r\nmasturbate, or who are affected with nymphomania--have led to the\r\nopinion, that voluptuous desires are situated exclusively in this\r\norgan, and that its removal will extinguish them. Levret was, we\r\nbelieve, the first who conceived the idea of curing nymphomania by this\r\noperation. Dubois performed it on a young girl, who was so addicted\r\nto onanism, that she was almost in the last stages of marasmus. Aware\r\nof the danger of her situation, and yet too weak, or too much under\r\nthe control of voluptuousness, she could not resist. In vain were her\r\nhands and limbs tied: she rubbed herself against the bed, and thus\r\nprocured excessive discharges. Her parents applied to Dubois, who\r\nproposed amputation of the clitoris. This was assented to. The organ\r\nwas removed by one stroke of the knife: the hemorrhage was arrested by\r\nthe actual cautery, and the girl recovered her health and strength.\r\nRicherand, who has reported this case, considers the operation\r\nperformed on this young girl as the most efficient remedy in such a\r\ncase. If the idea of cauterizing the vessels is disagreeable to the\r\npatients, the vessels of the clitoris might be tied, as are those of\r\nthe penis after amputation. (_Nosog. Chirurg._, second edition, 1808;\r\nvol. iv., p. 326.)\r\n\r\nThe following, which is similar to the preceding, but more remarkable\r\nin some respects, was published in the Journal of Surgery, by Graefe:--\r\n\r\n“The subject of this case was born in 1807, and grew very well, till\r\nthe age of fourteen months, when she became ill: for eight days, she\r\nwas affected alternately with constipation, diarrhœa, and vomiting. She\r\nremained sick till she was two years old, and did not walk till she was\r\nfour. She, however, never learned to talk, and exhibited symptoms of\r\nidiocy. This idiocy resisted the most varied treatment, progressively\r\nincreased, and the patient was finally reduced to a state below the\r\nbrute. She swallowed her feces, and passed hour after hour in a corner,\r\nher tongue lolling from her mouth.\r\n\r\n“The most experienced physicians considered her case as hopeless. A\r\nphysician at Berlin undertook to cure her. She was now fourteen years\r\nold. He remarked first in her a strong inclination to onanism: she\r\nindulged in this practice night and day. In this, there was a curative\r\nindication, which the physician embraced immediately. It seemed evident\r\nto him that masturbation prevented the development of the intellectual\r\nfaculties. Hence, she was prevented from sitting down; and the head\r\nwas cauterized, to obtain revulsion by the pain. The wound from this\r\noperation did not suppurate till after six weeks. Cold effusions were\r\napplied to the wound, and a solution of antimony was injected into it.\r\nThese remedies were followed by a slight degree of amendment. Douches\r\nand emetics were then used, but in vain. Finally, when the patient was\r\nfifteen years old, her physician resolved to extirpate the clitoris.\r\nThe operation was performed June 20, 1822, by Professor Graefe, of\r\nBerlin. The wound soon cicatrized; and the good effects of the process\r\nexceeded all expectations. The disposition to onanism was removed; the\r\nmind became expanded; and the education of the patient commenced. In\r\nthree years, she could talk, read, write, and even play a few tunes\r\non the piano--to be sure, rather imperfectly; but still she might be\r\nregarded as being in the way of recovering from her long and cruel\r\ndisease.”\r\n\r\nThe details of this case are not sufficient to establish whether\r\nidiocy was the cause or effect of onanism. We may conclude, however,\r\nfrom the result, that it was at least in great part the consequence of\r\nthis habit. It, however, was necessary to put a stop to the onanism\r\nbefore the idiocy disappeared. Farther, this case shows the extent\r\nof the restorative power of nature, when it is no longer impeded by\r\nmasturbation. It also shows, by the good effects arising from removing\r\nthe clitoris, that it would be wrong to think, as several authors, and\r\nparticularly Voisin, have asserted, that nymphomania always depended\r\non an affection of the cerebellum. Powerful and the most energetic\r\nrevulsives had been applied to this latter organ, but unsuccessfully.\r\nIt was not the first time the remedies had been used. Villeneuve long\r\nsince recommended the application of caustics to the legs, and of cups\r\naround the genital organs, with extensive scarifications, to appease\r\nvenereal desires.\r\n\r\nThe two following facts were communicated by Biett. The first is that\r\nof a lady, thirty-five years old, who became affected with nymphomania,\r\nafter long absence from her husband. After many unsuccessful efforts\r\nto cure this disease, extirpation of the clitoris was decided upon.\r\nThe operation was not easy, and there was considerable hemorrhage,\r\nrequiring the application of ligatures. In a few weeks, the patient\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe success of this operation induced Biett to advise a similar one in\r\nthe following case:--\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle C***, ten years old, of strong constitution and good\r\nmuscular developments, had been addicted to onanism since she was two\r\nyears old. She was taught it by her nurse, who remarked that she was\r\nquieted, when crying, by titillating the clitoris, in which she was\r\nsoon imitated by the patient. The habit finally caused great moral\r\nand physical degeneration. At first, the cause of her wasting away\r\nwas unknown; but when it was discovered, the parents tried every mode\r\nto break her of it. Their vigilance was in vain--she still continued\r\nit. Her mind remained unaffected, but not so with her physical\r\nconstitution. Mechanical means were now employed: the apparatus of\r\nLafont was applied, but without success; and there was danger of her\r\nbecoming idiotic. Her parents, after long hesitation, decided to have\r\nthe clitoris removed. The operation was performed June 26, 1831, with\r\nperfect success. The patient became restored, and her voluptuous\r\nfeelings disappeared.”\r\n\r\nMany have scruples in regard to this operation. They ask whether\r\nit is right to nip the enjoyments of love in the bud, &c. These\r\nconsiderations seem to me only to impose circumspection in respect to\r\nthe operation, and to show that the operation never should be employed\r\nuntil all other remedies have been tried. But when life is to be saved,\r\nor the mind is to be preserved, then we ought not to hesitate. We then\r\ndo, as in amputating a limb--we sacrifice a part for the whole. Nor is\r\nit demonstrated, that the venereal sense is for ever extinguished, by\r\nremoving the clitoris. This organ is not the exclusive seat of venereal\r\nsensations, as we have already seen, and shall see again. Hence, it may\r\nbe feared, for this reason, that the operation may not be successful.\r\nIn fact, only the prominent part of the clitoris is cut off: a large\r\nportion of the cavernous bodies remains. If the operation is performed\r\nbefore puberty, perhaps by developing their tissue, this feeling may\r\nextend at this period of life: but, even then, if these chances of\r\nreparation did not exist--if it were certain to destroy all sexual\r\ndesires--still this operation ought to be performed; as, without these\r\nfeelings of love, a female may become a good mother, and a devoted wife.\r\n\r\nOur remarks on the cerebellum, spinal marrow, and erectile tissue,\r\nmay apply to all parts of the genital apparatus; as each part may be\r\na direct cause of venereal excitement, and consequently an indirect\r\ncause of venereal excesses. This is certainly true of the mucous\r\nmembrane, which lines the genito-urinary passages. Every one knows\r\nthat acute inflammation of the interior of the urethra often causes\r\npainful erections, and which may attend a deformity of the penis; and\r\nhence the term _chordee_ is applied to these blenorrhœas. We have seen,\r\nwhen speaking of diurnal pollution, that chronic inflammations of this\r\ncanal may be followed by losses of semen. The presence of a stone in\r\nthe bladder usually causes an itching and tickling at the end of the\r\npenis, which has sometimes been the beginning of bad habits. If, after\r\nexcesses of the table, coition is indulged in to excess, it is because\r\nthe abuse of wine and liquors stimulates the mucous membranes, and\r\nparticularly those of which we are speaking--excites their action,\r\nand new desires arise. Is it not on the special character possessed\r\nby cantharides, of inflaming the urinary passages, that the violent\r\nsatyriasis caused by this remedy depends?\r\n\r\nThe phenomena we have mentioned are seen much more frequently in\r\nfemales than in males, as the mucous membrane of the genital organs is\r\nmuch more extensive and more exposed to the action of external agents\r\nin the former. We have known several cases of nymphomania to be caused\r\nby herpetic affections, which were seated within the vulva. Biett knew\r\na case of it in a female, sixty years old, affected with prurigo of\r\nthis part. Trousseau has known similar cases. Hence, the irritations\r\nof the vulva, attended with itching, have been considered by many\r\nauthors among the causes of onanism. Eczema, when it has extended to\r\nthe vulvo-vaginal mucous membrane, has been known to induce this habit\r\nviolently in females. Ascarides, which have escaped from the anus, have\r\noften caused violent itching, and afterward a venereal excitement,\r\nwhich was followed by the same result. Beck has known these worms to\r\nproduce nymphomania in a female seventy years old. Bitter injections\r\ninto the vagina were followed by the evacuation of a great number of\r\nthese animals, and by the cessation of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe remarks of many authors on the salacity of individuals afflicted\r\nwith herpetic eruptions must apply particularly to those who are\r\nafflicted with pruriginous diseases of the skin around or near the\r\ngenital organs. The excitement then extends to these organs, and awakes\r\nin them the sense of venery; a similar result may attend irritation of\r\nthe inner surface of the rectum. Wichmann thinks, and a case published\r\nby St. Marie confirms the opinion, that simply the presence of\r\nascarides in this instance may cause discharges of semen. Hemorrhoidal\r\nirritation has sometimes produced them. Thus Wichmann relates the case\r\nof an individual, in whom hemorrhoids caused an obstinate diarrhœa\r\nduring the day, and frequent pollutions at night. Nymphomania has been\r\nproduced by drastic enemata, and particularly by those made of gratiola.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to see symptoms of inflammation appear at the same\r\ntime or successively in different mucous membranes. The membrane lining\r\nthe genital organs is not more exempt from this, than others. The heat\r\nwhich patients feel in the genital parts, the redness and swelling\r\nwhich are there developed, are generally the only symptoms which then\r\nbecome known to the physician. But there is another, the excitement\r\nof the venereal sense, which often escapes him; either because the\r\npatients are too young to explain it, or because a natural feeling\r\nprompts them to conceal it. Hence this symptom is frequently unnoticed,\r\nexcept in rare cases, where it exists to a great degree, and presents\r\ncharacters analogous to those of satyriasis and nymphomania. Dr.\r\nDesportes was we believe the first one to point out a certain relation\r\nbetween venereal excitement and different catarrhal affections among\r\nwhich he has particularly mentioned the aphthous inflammation of the\r\npharynx termed by Guersent _angina pultacea_. M. Desportes has known\r\nattacks of at least eight cases of this angina to be preceded by a\r\nvivid excitement of the reproductive system, an excitement which is\r\nsometimes manifested by an irritation, which although not exactly\r\nthe venereal appetite, is analogous to it, and causes in the patient\r\nan evident feeling of distrust, inquietude, and chagrin. As this\r\nphenomenon has presented itself as a precursory symptom in at least one\r\nhalf of the cases of angina pultacea observed by him, he regards it\r\nas an index of the imminent invasion of this disease. He also thinks\r\nand with reason, that this phenomenon may, in young patients, become a\r\ncause of masturbation, and even in some cases, may pervert momentarily\r\nthe ideas and sentiments, so as to impel individuals to the commission\r\nof acts reputed criminal or culpable. This opinion of Desportes is\r\nsupported by eight facts. The most remarkable is that of a lady seventy\r\nyears old, in whom the angina pultacea, was preceded for about a month\r\nwith vivid and frequent venereal desires: they became so irresistible,\r\nthat notwithstanding her religious opinions, she forgot herself so far\r\nas to relieve her ardor by onanism.\r\n\r\nDesportes has attempted to explain this singular feeling, by the\r\nconnexion of the nerves of the neck with certain parts of the\r\nencephalon, the commencement of the spinal marrow. He might, we think,\r\nhave explained this more naturally, by observing that the genital\r\nexcitement, instead of appearing simultaneously with the affection of\r\nthe pharynx, disappeared simply from the appearance of the latter.\r\nThus, in one of these patients, a man of fifty years old, whose habits\r\nwere chaste, and who was suddenly affected with unusual venereal\r\ndesires and priapism, these symptoms ceased, when after twenty days,\r\nan angina appeared; which was followed by an eczema which affected\r\nthe hairy scalp, and the parts behind the ears. In another of the\r\ncases reported by Desportes, the genital excitement which appeared\r\nduring convalescence from pleuro pneumonia, was suddenly replaced by\r\nan inflammatory irritation of the digestive passages, and particularly\r\nof the inner membrane of the mouth. Is it not evident that the\r\nirritation was transmitted in these cases from one membrane to another.\r\nIf, however, Desportes has erred in the manner in which the genital\r\nexcitement is produced, he deserves credit for pointing out a symptom\r\nwhich merits the attention of practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe irritation of the internal integuments of the genital parts, is not\r\nonly, as this physician has thought, a precursory sign of that of the\r\npharynx. It may show itself during the continuance of an inflammation\r\nof any other portion of the mucous membranes, or it may even follow\r\nthis inflammation. Dr. Mirambeau has communicated to me two cases which\r\nconfirm this fact. The first is that of a boy who was affected after a\r\nchill, with a very obstinate gastroenteritis. This disease was nearly\r\nterminated, when the mucous surface of the penis became the seat of a\r\nvery severe irritation, which was soon attended with satyriasis. Things\r\ncame to such a pass that his hands were obliged to be tied to keep him\r\nfrom those manipulations which he had never indulged in before. The\r\nsubject of the second case was a girl nine years old, who presented the\r\nsame circumstances as in the preceding case. She also was obliged to be\r\ntied. This fit continued in these two cases, from ten to twelve days.\r\n\r\nHence irritation of the mucous membrane which lines the genito urinary\r\npassages may alone cause venereal excitement, and consequently onanism,\r\nindependent of any affection of the nervous centres. This fact is\r\nhighly essential on account of the important indications which may\r\nbe deduced from it. Aware of the possibility of its existence, the\r\nphysician will be more attentive to discover this irritation; he will\r\nfind it more frequently and may in a degree prevent a fatal habit: he\r\nwill also carefully remove every cause of irritation from the mucous\r\nintegument of the genital parts and discuss as promptly as possible\r\nthe inflammations which may be developed there. The mode of doing\r\nthis is by attending to the following rules. To keep the sexual parts\r\nperfectly clean by repeated ablutions: to forbid all excesses of the\r\ntable, and the use of such food and drinks as tend to render the urine\r\nmore irritating, and the genito urinary mucous surface more irritable;\r\nhence to discard the use of wine, liquors, coffee, tea, spices,\r\nbeer, particularly that made strong with hops: to allay irritations\r\nof the interior of the rectum, around the anus or those affecting\r\nthe integuments around the genital organs. When children complain of\r\nitching around the anus, you must ascertain whether this be not caused\r\nby ascarides which is easily done by inspecting the parts and the\r\nfeces: no means should be spared to get rid of these worms when they\r\nexist:[1] and finally the most efficient remedies should be used to\r\ncure the itching of the genitals as soon as this affection commences.\r\nOzanam communicated to the academy of medicine August 12, 1828, a\r\nvery acute case of nymphomania which had resisted antispasmodics,\r\nnarcotics, cold baths, &c.; and which was finally cured by applying to\r\nthe internal labia and clitoris a solution of four grains of nitrate\r\nof silver in an ounce of water. There was a marked inflammation of\r\nthe parts to which this was applied. (_Rev. Med._, _Sept. 1828._) In\r\n1833, we employed successfully another remedy, for a lady thirty-four\r\nyears old and subject to nervous affections. She experienced a\r\nfeeling of heat and irritation in the vulva and vagina which caused\r\nher excessive trouble. Solutions and injections of an infusion of\r\nthe wild cherry-tree, produced no relief. The introduction into the\r\nvagina of a pledget of lint moistened with a solution of the extract of\r\nbelladonna, (one grain to the ounce,) had a better effect. Different\r\nsymptoms indicated the absorption of this drug into the system and the\r\nirritation disappeared. But it returned a few days after, and we then\r\nadvised the application of ice within the vagina which relieved her,\r\nand finally brought about a permanent cure.\r\n\r\nThe irritation of the uterus in this lady might have had more or\r\nless influence in producing these distressing symptoms. Venereal\r\ndesires, and nymphomania may in fact also depend upon the state of\r\nthis organ. The excitement preceding and attending the period of\r\nmenstruation, renders females much more lascivious. This phenomenon\r\nis much more marked in the small number of animals who menstruate: it\r\nalways coexists in them with the period of rutting. This remarkable\r\nfact, which has long been known, of asses and monkeys, has lately\r\nbeen ascertained to exist in the roussettes by Carnot and Lesson, and\r\nin the genette by Cuvier. Farther inflammations and diseases of the\r\nuterus have often been observed in those affected with nymphomania.\r\nHelwiel relates the history of a lady, who, after being for a long time\r\nindifferent to conjugal pleasures, became extremely salacious. She died\r\nsome time afterward, and on opening the dead body, fibrous tumours were\r\nfound in the tissue of the uterus, and hydaleds in the ovaries. Calmeil\r\nfound in a monomaniac, who was most furiously addicted to onanism, and\r\nwho had a perfect hymen, that the os tincæ and a part of the neck of\r\nthe uterus were of a violet colour, and were softened and ulcerated.\r\nThis author observes that generally, when deranged females imagine\r\nthemselves pregnant, or that they have been violated, are finally known\r\nto think of their genital organs, there is commonly some lesion of the\r\nuterus. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, _art. Alienes_.) In the cases which\r\nhave been mentioned, the affection of the uterus was not so much the\r\ncause as the result of the excesses which had been committed, but this\r\ncannot be said of those cases where Lisfranc has seen cauterization\r\nof the neck of the uterus to be followed in the genital organs with a\r\nkind of erethism which is attended with void desires. Is not this an\r\nexperimental proof, that an irritation of the uterus may produce an\r\nexaltation of the venereal sense.\r\n\r\nThis excitement from congenital or accidental dispositions, may\r\naffect the ovaries; to prove this we have only to consider that\r\ntheir development exactly follows that of the venereal sense: that\r\nat forty-five years they begin to diminish in size, and finally they\r\ndisappear: their removal or destruction too is always attended with the\r\nextinction of venereal desires. The respective size of the veins and\r\narteries of the ovaries has been mentioned by some authors as a cause\r\nof salacity: the amorous ardor of animals, say they, is much greater,\r\nwhen the veins of the ovaries are smaller and fewer than the arteries.\r\nHaller found that the last-named vessels were very much developed in a\r\nfemale whose temperament was extremely amorous. Different alterations\r\nin the ovaries have been found in those affected with nymphomania.\r\nBosset, Blancard, Vesalius, Riolan, Mangel, Dimmerbroede, Riviere,\r\nLieutaud &c. have observed cases of this. De Blegnay states that one\r\nof the girls confined at the Salpetrière, and who had been affected\r\nseveral times with furor uterinus, was once seized so violently\r\nthat it was necessary to tie her. This unfortunate girl perished by\r\nsuffocation, while struggling to extricate herself. On opening the dead\r\nbody the left ovary and Fallopian tube were found much diseased.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the ovaries has been performed successfully to appease\r\nexcessive uterine ardor; a swineherd, irritated by the conduct of his\r\ndaughter, extirpated these organs and thus extinguished her passions.\r\nThe ovaries however have been extirpated several times on account of\r\ndisease. The operation has been performed on several women and with\r\nsuccess by Dr. Sacchi of Italy, and Dr. D. L. Rogers of New York. The\r\nusual effects in those who are fortunate enough to survive, are a\r\nwasting of the mammæ and a perfect indifference to the act of venery\r\n(_Bulletin therapeutique_, vol. iv., p. 313.)\r\n\r\nWe need not make many remarks on the effects of castration in the male\r\nto show the influence of the testes on the development and vivacity\r\nof lascivious desires. We know that it has been asserted that these\r\ndesires may remain after the loss of these organs. In support of this\r\nopinion have been quoted Galen, Juvenal, Brantome and many other\r\nauthors, particularly Franck, who states that four eunuchs in a city\r\nhad so many intrigues with females, that the police were obliged to\r\ninterfere. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, vol. iv. p. 269.) But these facts\r\nonly prove that eunuchs may indulge in pretended coition and that they\r\npreserve some sparks of the fire which is generally seated in the\r\ntesticles. Most authors have attributed the action of these organs\r\nin the sense of venery, to the fluid secreted by them, to the semen.\r\nThey say that this fluid awakes this sense either by the qualities it\r\nassumes, when accumulating in the testicles or seminal vesicles, or\r\nbecause it is carried by absorption to all parts of the body. This\r\nopinion is certainly much too positive: but in the present state of\r\nscience, can we, as do many authors, assert that it has no foundation?\r\nThe qualities of the semen may certainly vary much, as may be proved by\r\nthe presence or absence of the spermatic animalculæ. It is entertained\r\nfor instance, that these animalculæ do not appear before puberty, and\r\nthat they are not to be found in old age, that they disappear during\r\nsickness, and that in many animals, in most birds for instance, they\r\noccur only during the season of mating (_Dumas_, _Dict. class. d’hist.\r\nnat._, _art. generation_.) The venereal sense becomes imperious, when\r\nthe individual secretes real semen, and this sense may be felt in\r\nold men, after semen is no longer formed. The fulness of the seminal\r\nvesicles cannot be absolutely necessary for venereal desires, because\r\nthese organs do not exist in birds, in many cold-blooded animals and\r\nin some of the mammalia. Are these persons in whom the testicles,\r\ninstead of descending into the bursæ as usual about the seventh mouth\r\nof fetal life, remain in the abdomen, are these persons, who are termed\r\ncryptorchides more addicted than others to sensual pleasures? This has\r\nbeen asserted by many authors, and particularly by Monro and Hunter.\r\nThey certainly are not less so. Poliniere has related a case of a\r\nperson of this character 17 years old whom he saw at Brest in 1812, and\r\nwho indulged most immoderately in venereal pleasures contrary to the\r\nadvice of his physicians. Death soon put an end to his career.\r\n\r\nThe sensuality attributed to the cryptorchides has been explained\r\nby the greater degree of heat experienced in the testicles, when\r\nthey remain in the abdomen. Be this as it may, the excitement of\r\nthese organs probably exalts the sense of venery. When the state of\r\nexcitement is very marked, they swell and become more sensible: these\r\nsymptoms however are much more marked in animals during the period of\r\nrutting, than in our species. Accidental irritations of the testicles\r\nhave sometimes also caused an unusual excitement of the sense of\r\nvenery. Moreau attended for a long time a man advanced in age, who\r\nconsulted him particularly for pollutions attended with amatory dreams.\r\nThese symptoms which were very distressing constantly occurred,\r\nwhenever the fibrous membrane of the testicles was affected with\r\nchronic rheumatism.\r\n\r\nFrom our remarks, we can conceive that extirpation of the testicles\r\nwould be a powerful remedy, in fact the most efficient of all remedies,\r\nto quell lascivious desires, and to put an end to venereal excesses.\r\nHence individuals have been known to sacrifice these organs, and thus\r\nto rid them«elves of a salacity which rendered them unhappy. Baldassar\r\nrelates the history of a man on whom he tried every remedy, and\r\nfinally found nothing better than fasting and prayers. “Not recovering\r\nunder these remedies,” says this author, “he wished the operation of\r\ncastration to be performed, but I thought it inexpedient. The patient\r\nhowever pressed me very earnestly, and sought to win over to his\r\nviews by presents those who opposed his wishes. He even promised me an\r\nambling poney of remarkable beauty, if I would consent to perform it.”\r\nReduced to despair some individuals have even castrated themselves.\r\nOrigen, it is well known, mutilated himself, in order to extinguish\r\nthe warmth of his temperament. This operation has been performed by\r\nsurgeons and with happy results. A surgeon of Bernstadt was less\r\nfortunate: he removed the testes of a man 73 years old, in consequence\r\nof the unusual desires he experienced. The operation was not attended\r\nwith the expected result. (Sprengel, _Hist. de la med._, _vol. ix_.)\r\nHence this remedy is not infallible. We will add that it is far from\r\nbeing without danger, particularly in those individuals who are already\r\nexhausted by excesses. Farther, the operation is not confined, as in\r\namputation of the clitoris, to the extinction of the venereal sense: it\r\ntakes away the procreating power, and causes that moral and physical\r\ndeterioration which is seen in eunuchs, even when they have lost their\r\ntesticles after puberty. These therefore are reasons why this operation\r\nshould not be performed; an operation which is disapproved of by most\r\nauthors. We will except however Simon, who advises as a last resource\r\nin those affected with onanism to press upon or tie the vas deferens\r\nor the spermatic artery; for it is better, said he, that the patient\r\nshould live a eunuch, than that he should inevitably perish. (_Hygiene\r\nde la jeunesse_, p. 174.) Some practical conclusions may be drawn\r\nfrom the facts we have mentioned. Thus in some patients, cold lotions\r\nor applications of ice to the scrotum, and of leeches around it, may\r\nbe used with advantage. Young patients also should have these parts\r\nclothed lightly.\r\n\r\nDiseases affecting various parts by their action on the organs\r\nmentioned, that is on the cerebellum, spinal marrow and the genital\r\nsystem, may cause a kind of a state of rutting and thus become the\r\noccasion of venereal excesses. For instance an unusual venereal\r\nexcitement is sometimes a forerunner of an attack of gout, which may\r\nbe explained by considering that the invasion of the local symptoms of\r\nthis disease, is usually preceded by the irritation of several mucous\r\nmembranes. Does not the salacity which all authors have mentioned\r\nas being peculiar to phthisical persons depend on the part which\r\nthe genito-urinary membrane takes in the general excitement of the\r\nmucous membranes which is so common in the tuberculous affection of\r\nthe lungs? Pathological anatomy has thrown no light on the subject.\r\nOf forty patients affected with phthisis, where the prostate gland,\r\nseminal vesicles, and vasa deferentia were carefully examined by Louis,\r\nthree only presented an alteration of these parts; this consisted in\r\nthe deposition of a quantity of tuberculous matter in the prostate\r\ngland: in one of them this matter was found in the seminal vesicles\r\nand vasa deferentia. (_Recherches anatopath. sur la phthisie_, 1825,\r\np. 132.) Louis says nothing in regard to the amatory passions of these\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe affection of the genito-urinary mucous membrane, accounts also\r\nfor the venereal sensations which many authors have mentioned as a\r\nsymptom of the elephantiasis of the Greeks, otherwise termed lepra\r\ntubercularis. The frequency of this symptom was so remarkable, that\r\nthe ancients confounded elephantiasis with satyriasis. Sonnini saw at\r\nCana, in the island of Candia, a great many individuals of both sexes,\r\naffected with this kind of leprosy. They were confined according to\r\ncustom, in barracks without the walls of the city, and there they\r\nindulged in the most unbridled licentiousness. Even the old men were\r\nvery lascivious. He gives an instance of a leper who, on the night of\r\nhis death, indulged his desires. Niebuhr speaks of another leper who\r\ncarried away by his ardor, imparted his disease to a woman of Bagdad,\r\nwho was admitted with him into the lazaretto of that city. Vidal\r\nand Joannis assert that they have seen this _libido_ in those Greek\r\nsailors affected with elephantiasis. After these proofs, it required\r\nsome boldness to deny the possibility of this symptom, which to us\r\nseems easily explained. Consider the nature of elephantiasis: while\r\nit affects the skin, it extends to the mucous membranes, where we\r\nfind tubercles, ulcerations, softenings, &c. Why should the membrane,\r\nlining the genito-urinary passages, be exempt from these alterations?\r\nIs it not then probable that this membrane was diseased in some way\r\nor other, in those individuals affected with libido? We can easily\r\nimagine, too, that as these alterations cannot be constant in lepra\r\ntubercularis, the symptom of which we are speaking must often be\r\ndeficient, which explains why different authors who have observed cases\r\nof elephantiasis, particularly Alibert, Rayer and Cazenave, have not\r\nmet with it. An affection of the genital organs may produce results\r\ncompletely opposite to libido: it may arrest the development of the\r\ngenital organs when it appears before puberty. The individuals then\r\npresent the marked characters of eunuchs, which has been observed by\r\nAdams, (Obs. on morbid poisons.) and probably Pallas, who asserts that\r\nthe Tartans affected with elephantiasis, are averse to the pleasures of\r\nlove. Farther, in lepra tubercularis, the sexual parts are often, and\r\naccording to Alibert, most generally affected; this would necessarily\r\nextinguish all venereal desires. This probably was the case in the\r\npatient mentioned by Cazenave, in whom the testicles, glands and\r\nprepuce were found converted into a lardaceous tissue; and where, too,\r\nthe corpora cavernosa were destitute of blood, and presented an evident\r\nhypertrophy of their septa.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the genital sense is exalted, because it is the\r\nonly one, or nearly so, which continues. This is frequently seen in\r\nidiots, and in those affected with dementia. The imbeciles, if left to\r\nthemselves, “says Esquirol,” sometimes at the period of puberty become\r\naffected with onanism, nymphomania, or hysteria. Idiots also often\r\nindulge in the most unrestrained masturbation. This can readily be\r\nimagined: these individuals are in a measure isolated by the debility\r\nor weakness of their senses and intelligence. As they receive no\r\nexternal impressions, those which are inherent, exercise unlimited\r\npower. The internal senses are then much more regarded, because they\r\nspeak alone. That which is in others only a desire, becomes in idiots\r\na want: hence there are many who seem to live, merely to eat, drink,\r\nand indulge in licentiousness. When speaking of the effects of onanism\r\non the mental faculties, we have shown that the venereal sense becomes\r\nheightened, as these other faculties are weakened. This fact may be\r\nremarked, whatever may have been the cause of derangement: for many\r\nindividuals become affected with onanistic satyriasis, because they are\r\nimbecile or idiotic. Finally, idiocy may be the effect and cause of\r\nonanism. Sometimes the disease appears first, sometimes the habit--but\r\nas soon as they exist they strive continually to increase, and we are\r\nunable to say which of the two exercises the stronger influence on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOur remarks on idiocy are equally applicable to cretinism, which is a\r\nvariety of this affection. The cretins, though small, goitrous, hideous\r\nand imbecile, are extremely salacious, and this feeling is allayed by\r\nintercourse between them, or by onanism. A remarkable fact which has\r\nbeen observed twice, once in a cretin and once in an idiot, may throw\r\nsome light on the organic causes of the inverse progress followed by\r\nthe external and internal senses in this kind of patients: it is the\r\n_hypertrophy of the ganglionnary nervous system_. One of these cases\r\nis recorded by M. Schiffner. He found, on the cadaver of a cretin,\r\nthat the ganglions of the great sympathetic nerve, situated along the\r\nvertebral column, were unusually large. The sympathetic nerve of the\r\nleft side, on a level with the 6th vertebra presented a ganglion the\r\nsize of a hen’s egg. Before this case of Schiffner, in 1819, Cayre\r\nalso, in a thesis on idiotism, had mentioned the excessive development\r\nof the ganglionnary system, in one born an idiot. The cervical\r\nganglions were three times their usual size; those of the thorax were\r\nlarger than in the healthy state, and this was the case also with the\r\nsemilunar ganglions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that individuals appear much more lascivious, as they\r\nbecome more stupid and insensible; venereal sensuality often developes\r\nitself under very different circumstances. It may be only an episode,\r\nand sometimes it is an effect of the general susceptibility. A person\r\nis lascivious, because he is alive to vivid impressions; because the\r\ngenital organs, like the rest of the economy, are easily excited,\r\nand their excitement is vividly felt. This disposition occurs often\r\nin hypochondriac and hysterical people; that is, in individuals who\r\nare so susceptible as to be habitually sick. They are easily excited,\r\nand have nocturnal pollutions from the slightest cause. The genital\r\norgans, also like the others, may become affected by an irritation\r\nwhich is seated at a greater or less distance from them; for instance,\r\nin the stomach, lungs, skin, &c. Those persons who are affected with\r\ncutaneous diseases, which cause itching, are generally extremely\r\nlascivious. Symptoms similar to priapism and satyriasis, appear in\r\nnumerous diseases. Nervous or flatulent colics have often been known\r\nto produce a similar effect. A woman observed in 1833, at Hotel Dieu,\r\nin the ward of Bouillaud, and whose case is reported by Donne, (Revue\r\nMed., June, 1833,) presented a phenomena, which, notwithstanding its\r\nstrangeness, is explained by what we have said. She was thirty years\r\nold, of a strong constitution, and hysterical. After an attack of acute\r\nrheumatism affecting the wrist, her hand became exquisitely sensible,\r\nand the slightest friction upon it, procured for the patient all the\r\nsensations arising from coition. This aberration of the sensibility\r\ndisappeared with the last traces of the rheumatic inflammation, and\r\nthe part regained its natural state. A highly respectable man, Dr.\r\nMirambeau, communicated to us the case of a child who procured similar\r\nsensations by pulling his umbilicus. His health suffered so much\r\nin consequence of this singular habit, that coercive measures were\r\nemployed to check it. We must remark, however, that notwithstanding the\r\nsensations mentioned, this patient presented no erection nor any other\r\nphenomena in the genital organs, similar to those of the act of venery.\r\n\r\n_Of the things which may produce venereal excitement, and of the modes\r\nof preservation which are connected with them._ These things are all\r\nthose which are capable of increasing the sensibility in general\r\nand particularly that of the organs of venery: the means are, the\r\ninfluences which may be used to act in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\nThe venereal desire may develope itself at all seasons. The most\r\nfavorable to its appearance, however, is spring. This fact was well\r\nknown to the ancients: but it did not rest on a scientific foundation\r\ntill recently. The confirmation of this fact is owing to the\r\nstatistical labors of Villermé in France and of Quetelet and Smits in\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nVillermé proposed to establish, from the register of births, the\r\nperiods of the year when conceptions occur most frequently. He arranged\r\nthe months in the following order. May, June, April, July, February,\r\nMarch, December, January, August, November, September, October.\r\n\r\nHence the three months when there are the most conceptions are April\r\nMay and June, and those in which there are the fewest are September,\r\nOctober, and November. Hence it is in spring, at that period of the\r\nyear when vegetation sprouts forth and when the trees are covered with\r\nfoliage, when most animals seek their mates, that pregnancy is most\r\ncommon: while in autumn, that season in which vegetable life is as it\r\nwere extinguished, is also the period when the human race labors least\r\nat reproduction. The results obtained by Quetelet and Smits, conform\r\nentirely with the above. It now remains to know whether the difference\r\nbetween spring and autumn arises from there being less procreative\r\nexertion or whether conception or impregnation at that time are more\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this question Villermé consulted the criminal calendar to\r\nascertain at what period of the year there were the most attempts\r\nat rape: and he found that it was the same as that when the most\r\nconceptions occur, that is in the spring. The same result was obtained\r\nby Quetelet and Smits. May not these crimes be more common in the\r\nspring because then men have more opportunity of being guilty, as\r\nat that time females may be found alone and loosely clothed, in the\r\nwoods and distant places? But these same circumstances exist in the\r\nmonths of August and September, and yet the respective number of\r\nthese crimes diminishes in these two months. Nor can this greater\r\nnumber of pregnancies be attributed to the fact that more marriages\r\nare contracted at one period of the year than at another, for the\r\n_maximum_ and _minimum_ of births can be referred in every country and\r\nat all times, with but few limitations to the same periods, while the\r\n_maximum_ and _minimum_ of marriages in different countries present\r\ngreat and numerous differences. We may then consider it as determined\r\nthat man is subject to a certain extent to a kind of _periodical heat_,\r\nwhich returns every year in the spring.\r\n\r\nIt is not the heat of weather which produces this phenomenon, for if\r\nthis were the case, it would appear in July and August rather than\r\nin April and May: but it is _the return of early warmth_. Perhaps\r\nthis phenomenon also arises from influences now unknown, which would\r\ncontribute in early spring to the vernal resurrection of organized\r\nbeings. The slight variations in the period of heat in men, in\r\ndifferent climates, confirms what has been said as to the action of\r\nspring. Villermé having compared the different parts of France, of\r\nEurope and even of the two hemispheres, found that the maximum of\r\nconceptions is, like this season, more precocious in warm than in cold\r\nclimates. There is then a period of the year when man is more disposed\r\nto indulge in these excesses and when his desires should be more\r\ncarefully controlled. We have already seen that Wichmann regards the\r\nspring as a cause why diurnal pollutions are more active and frequent;\r\nthe same may be said of nymphomania. In a female whose history has\r\nalready been given and who was affected with this disease, the period\r\nof the greatest degree of salacity extended from the beginning to the\r\nend of this season.\r\n\r\nThere is another observation which at first seems only of a moderate\r\ndegree of importance but which may present practical deductions of\r\ngreat interest. Villermé has found that the maximum and minimum of\r\nconceptions are much less marked in the cities than in the country, and\r\nstill less so in the large cities. This fact confirms our remarks on\r\nthe influence of seasons, for it shows that this influence is less, the\r\nmore individuals are exposed to it. It shows too how far the salacity\r\nof men may be influenced by his mode of living. This remark has long\r\nbeen made in regard to animals: the period of rutting ceases to be\r\nmarked periodically when they pass from a savage to a domestic state.\r\nWe have now to learn in what manner a retired life acts on the venereal\r\nsense. Another observation of M. Villermé seems to us to throw light on\r\nthis topic.\r\n\r\nThe law of _maximum_ and _minimum_, which has just been treated of,\r\npresents a remarkable exception which is seen in cold countries as\r\nSweden, Finland, St. Petersburgh, &c. In these countries, exceptions\r\noccur most frequently in the months of December and January, in short\r\nin winter. Different causes have been supposed to account for this\r\nexception: there is but one however, which will explain it well--that\r\nis the manner in which the inhabitants of these countries are clothed\r\nduring the cold season. By means of dress and warmth they then create\r\nan artificial climate by which they are enabled to resist the rigor\r\nof that in which they dwell. The whole body is enveloped in numerous\r\nthick and warm garments, which fit accurately, envelope it exactly\r\nand preserve for the body its natural temperature: placing these\r\nindividuals in a position analogous to that of vegetables which are\r\nhastened in their growth by manure. Farther they preserve in their\r\ndwellings a degree of temperature which would be insupportable in a\r\ntemperate climate. In fact if the inhabitants of the polar regions\r\nshould keep civil registers of births, their examination would\r\ndoubtless demonstrate that in these rude climates, the fine season is\r\nnot that of amours. It is well known that puberty in these countries\r\nis more precocious, as is the case under the tropics. Thus the Samoid\r\nwomen menstruate at the age of 11 years and are often mothers at 12.\r\n(Klingstadt, _Memoire sur les Samoides_, pp. 41. & 43.) This is not to\r\nbe wondered at when we consider that they live in subterranean caves,\r\nwhere there is a stifling heat produced by throwing water on redhot\r\nstones. Dwellings then in cold countries may be considered as hot\r\nhouses which act on man as they do on vegetables.\r\n\r\nThese facts established, let us consider their consequences; do they\r\nnot prove, that an artificial climate may develope the venereal sense\r\nprematurely or too vividly? That on the coming of winter a young man\r\nought not to be clothed too warm? That too many quilts should not be\r\nput on the bed at night? That the cold should be braved? That we should\r\nforbid too long a continuance in warm rooms? These principles are\r\ndeduced naturally from observations on the seasons. It is unnecessary\r\nto say, that these rules, good as they are, are more particularly\r\napplicable to those who are suspected or convicted of masturbation.\r\nIn our preceding remarks we have paid regard only to the temperate\r\nzones of the two hemispheres, that is, to those countries where there\r\nare four distinct seasons nearly equal in length. But if we approach\r\nthe equinoctial line, those regions of the globe where the year is\r\ndivided into a very long summer and a very short winter, the influence\r\nof seasons is effaced by that of _climate_. We shall not repeat in\r\nthis place all that has been said in regard to the precocity of the\r\ninhabitants of warm countries, their ardor in love, the excesses to\r\nwhich they are addicted, the rapidity with which they grow old; all\r\nthese facts are well known. But we will make a remark which seems\r\nto us important: if the habitual and long continued action of solar\r\nheat, hastens the appearances of the venereal sense, and gives it so\r\nmuch power, why will not the continued action of any other heat, for\r\ninstance of clothing, dwellings, baths, &c., produce a similar result?\r\nIt seems to us that the admission of the first fact necessarily implies\r\nthe other. Thus whether we regard the influence of seasons exerted\r\naround us, or that of climates which are far distant, we always arrive\r\nat the conclusion that by a delicate education, and by taking care to\r\npreserve children from the slightest cold, we hasten the excitement\r\nof their sensual feelings, to which they are more liable to become\r\nvictims. Hence in prescribing a change of scene for a young man\r\naddicted to onanism, we should be careful not to expose him to hot\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nAre there any emanations which have the power of deadening the\r\nvenereal sense? From a case already mentioned, and which we owe to M.\r\nVillermé, we might suspect that emanations from stagnant waters have\r\nthis effect: but it is probable that if procreation is less active in\r\nmarshy countries during the most unhealthy seasons, it is because the\r\nnumber of sick is greater. It is well known that notwithstanding all\r\nemanations, the venereal sense may be very precocious, and may lead\r\nwhole communities to indulge in excesses: we might cite as instances\r\nthe inhabitants of the marshy parts of the Landes of Bordeaux, and the\r\nSolognese.\r\n\r\nThe power which certain odors have of exciting to desire is by no\r\nmeans doubtful, at least so far as animals are concerned. Most of the\r\nmammalia at the period of rutting, exhale certain emanations which\r\nserve to inform the male at a distance of the presence of a female and\r\nto excite in him the desire of copulation. Even in the insect kingdom\r\nsome facts exist which cannot be accounted for except on the principle\r\nof odorous effluvia. Thus if we shut up in a perfectly close box a\r\nfemale bombyx, we shall soon see males flying around it, who cannot be\r\nguided there by the sense of sight. Does any thing similar occur in\r\nthe human family? Many authors assert the affirmative. “Odors,” says\r\nCabanis, “act powerfully on the nervous system: they incite it to all\r\npleasurable sensations: they communicate to it this slight disturbance\r\nwhich seems to be inseparable from it, and this because they exercise\r\na special influence on the organs which are the seat of the most vivid\r\npleasure granted us by nature. In infancy, the influence of smell is\r\nbut slight: in old age, it is feeble: it is most active at the period\r\nof youth which is that of love.” (_Rapports du phys. an morale de\r\nl’homme_, vol. I, p. 222.) Among many nations even in remote antiquity,\r\nvoluptuous females excited their visitors to desire by the cosmetic\r\nuse of different perfumes, particularly by musk. This substance has\r\nbeen said to be capable of producing even nocturnal pollutions. (_Luc.\r\nLebrœchus, Hist. Moschi_, ch. 24, p. 153.) On the other hand, we read\r\nthat Henry IV. thought that the natural odor of the sexual parts was\r\nmore powerful than any cosmetics. Notwithstanding these testimonials\r\nand many others of a similar character, which might be adduced, we\r\nbelieve that in our species, where the sense of smell has so little\r\ninfluence compared to what it has in animals, that odors have but a\r\nslight effect in exciting to sexual pleasures. We think it prudent\r\nhowever to forbid the abuse of cosmetics in young people.\r\n\r\nIrritation of the skin, particularly in the neighborhood of the sexual\r\nparts, may act on them as we have seen, and produce venereal desires.\r\nDebauched libertines have frequently sought pleasure in this, and\r\nhave sometimes lashed themselves with thongs, or other instruments\r\nof torture. In the time of Nero, the art of invigorating the virile\r\npowers with green nettles was known and practised. Many authors have\r\nstated details on this topic which may be found in the treatise of\r\nMelbourne, (_De flagrorum usu in re venerea_, Lugd. Batav. 1643,[2])\r\nand an article by Virey. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, art. _Flagellation_.)\r\nThe pleasures of flagellation, however, also have their limits: it\r\nhas therefore been prescribed to deaden carnal desires, as well as to\r\nexcite them. More than one saint has flagellated himself with this\r\nhope. In order that it should be efficacious, it should be used with\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nIt can easily be imagined that this remedy may have a very different\r\neffect from that proposed. Castigation, and also the denuding of the\r\nbody, which is necessary, often have an effect on children, indicated\r\nby the erection of the penis. Young persons sometimes desire this\r\npunishment. The sensations caused by it have been so strong, as to\r\nbe followed by an immediate emission. How many children have become\r\naddicted to onanism, in consequence of this imprudent punishment!\r\nhow often has the fatal habit of onanism been encouraged by it!\r\nThese consequences have been pointed out by many authors. Pic de\r\nla Mirandole, Rhodoginus, &c., have related instances of it. The\r\nfollowing is from Serrurier. “One of my school-fellows,” says he,\r\n“found an indescribable pleasure in being whipped: he took every\r\noccasion to provoke the master, who never pardoned an offender, but\r\nhad him scourged, by individuals to whom this duty was committed. This\r\nsame school-fellow declared that he was sorry when the punishment was\r\nended, because then the pollution was not complete. What has been\r\nthe consequence of this horrid discovery. The unhappy person became\r\naddicted to onanism. Reduced to the lowest stage of consumption, in\r\nconsequence of the habitual loss of semen, his death presents us a\r\npicture of depravity, and an instance of the danger to which one is\r\nexposed by this fatal passion.” Castigation is much more to be dreaded\r\nwhen practised by one of an opposite sex from that of the patient. Even\r\nyoung children notice this difference. Rousseau, describing the effect\r\nproduced on him by being punished by Mademoiselle Lambercier, says,\r\nhe was then eight years old, “For a long time she confined herself to\r\nthreats, and the threat of punishment seemed very dreadful to me; but\r\nafter it was performed, I found it less terrible than I expected; so\r\nmuch so, that it required all my natural sweetness to prevent me from\r\nseeking a return of the punishment, by averting it: for I found in\r\nthe pain, and even in the shame, a mixture of sensuality which had\r\nleft rather a desire, than a fear to be punished by the same hand.\r\nThe same punishment from the hand of her brother would doubtless have\r\nbeen less agreeable.” Rousseau having exposed himself a second time to\r\npunishment, it was seen _by a certain sign_, that this chastisement\r\ndid not produce the desired effect: he therefore escaped afterward.\r\nThanks to his temperament, Rousseau did not contract, at that dangerous\r\nperiod, a habit which would have extinguished, at their source, those\r\nadmirable faculties which were afterward developed.\r\n\r\nThe importance of separating the sexes in schools can be seen from the\r\npreceding remarks: this is done in many institutions, and should be\r\npractised in all. The rod, too, should also be excluded from families,\r\nand physicians should explain to families the double danger of a loss\r\nof modesty, and of exciting the senses.\r\n\r\nCertain articles of clothing may excite the skin, cause an itching,\r\nand thus produce effects similar to those of flagellation. Haircloth\r\nand sackcloth, with which some orders of monks are now clothed, have\r\ncontributed, it is said, together with the mode of life to that\r\nreputation for incontinence possessed by some orders of friars. A want\r\nof cleanliness has also had the same effect. Be this true or not, it\r\nis wise to avoid the use of flannels next the skin, particularly in\r\nyoung patients, and around the pelvis. Hence woollen pantaloons should\r\nalways be lined. The importance of keeping the sexual organs clean, has\r\nalready been pointed out; the same remarks apply to the whole body.\r\n\r\nThis cleanliness must be maintained by lotions and baths. The former\r\nought generally to be cold: this rule is seldom contra-indicated. As\r\nto baths, we would remark that hot baths ought seldom to be prescribed\r\nfor onanists and for young persons generally, because of the excitement\r\nwhich they cause. Tepid baths should also be used with care, as they\r\nrender one susceptible and delicate. Cold baths ought always then to be\r\npreferred, when the season and health of the patients permit. There are\r\nother rules to be mentioned hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe venereal appetite may be much modified by food and drinks. This\r\npassion and the excesses with which it is attended may be connected\r\nwith the diet used. Hence when we attempt to cure a young person of\r\nonanism a good selection of food and drink is very essential. It is\r\ntherefore important to state the dietetic conditions by which the\r\nvenereal appetite is excited or depressed.\r\n\r\n_Sine cerere et Baccho friget Venus_ is an old proverb, which however\r\nis too obsolete. Generally speaking abundance of good food is more\r\nfavorable to venereal desires than a contrary mode of diet. This may\r\nbe seen on a large scale by comparing years of plenty with those of\r\nscarcity. We can then remark how injurious periods of public distress\r\nare to the procreative power. This has long been observed, but has\r\nnow been demonstrated beyond a doubt, by the patient researches of\r\nVillermé. He has ascertained from several statistical tables of\r\npopulation in France, that at the period of the revolution when\r\nthe duty was removed from wine, salt, &c., when the laborers found\r\nthemselves unusually prosperous, when they indulged in feasts and\r\ncelebrations, in short, lived better, the number of births evidently\r\nincreased. Eleven tables were examined by Villermé, and to this\r\nremark--he found but one exception. On the contrary, when the diet\r\nof the people is poor and insufficient, the number of conceptions\r\ndiminishes and never resumes its level till abundance is restored. It\r\nwould even seem that after the period of scarcity has passed away, it\r\nstill continues to exercise an extraordinary degree of energy.\r\n\r\nThese facts were very manifest after the bad harvest of 1816: the\r\nnumber of conceptions, proportionally speaking was less, from November\r\n1816 to September 1817, especially during the months of April, May,\r\nJune, and July, than in other years. (_Ann. d’hyg. publ., Jun. 1834._)\r\nSimilar observations have been made in animals: it is remarked that the\r\nperiod of heat supervenes when they are best fed, and that generally\r\nthey are much more productive when they are domesticated than when in\r\na wild state, where they are often liable to long fasts. Hence there\r\nis reason for prescribing fasting to deaden carnal passions. Villermé\r\nhas remarked that in all those catholic countries of which he has seen\r\nstatistics, Lent, as it is now observed, and particularly as it was\r\nformerly kept, seems to exercise an unfavorable influence on generation.\r\n\r\nThe facts which have been mentioned may be explained in several ways:\r\nfirst by the action of plenty and scarcity on the health of the public.\r\nProbably in times of scarcity, a state of things is observed analogous\r\nto what is seen in marshy countries during the reign of epidemics.\r\nThe action of abundance on the power of procreation may be explained\r\nalso by the direct influence of the labor of digestion on the organs\r\nwhere the venereal sense is located. It is known that amorous desires\r\nare often developed directly after taking food. Nocturnal pollutions\r\nsometimes occur directly after lying down. Serrurier speaks of a\r\nmaniac who had seminal emissions on taking food after long abstinence.\r\n(_Dict. des Sc. Med._, vol. xliv. p. 116.) Farther the effect alluded\r\nto may be produced as is readily imagined, more easily and forcibly\r\nwhen the excitement attending the labor of digestion is excessive when\r\nfor instance, the repast has been great, composed of many exciting and\r\nstimulant articles of food and of good wine or with a small quantity of\r\nalcoholic drinks. Those individuals who are subject to pollution, feel\r\nthe direct influence of these circumstances.\r\n\r\nBeside the immediate effect mentioned, a warm and analeptic diet by\r\ngiving the body an increase of excitement and force, may render amorous\r\ndesires more frequent and vivid. Thus the habitual free use of meats,\r\ngame, pork, ragouts, spices, heavy wines, liquors, coffee, &c., must\r\nbe considered as an indirect cause of venereal excesses, particularly\r\nif the persons who live on this regimen do not counteract its effects\r\nby active exercise. The use of vegetables, especially those which are\r\nnot very nutritious, have contrary effects. This remark must not be\r\nconsidered too obsolete. A debilitating diet and excessive salacity\r\nsometimes coexist: The Landes of Gironde are a striking instance of\r\nthis; their diet is very miserable; they live on vegetable soups made\r\nwith rancid lard; broths of meal, of coarse bread, and water, pure or\r\nacidulated at most with vinegar, &c. Hence they are extremely thin, are\r\ndark and sallow, and have an appearance of unhealthiness: this however\r\ndoes not prevent their indulgence in love, to which they are extremely\r\naddicted.\r\n\r\nDifferent articles of food have been mentioned as contributing more\r\nthan any others to excite the genital powers. Among them are found\r\n_fishes_. It would seem that this quality has long been attributed\r\nto them; this opinion however has not been received by moderns with\r\nmuch credit until it was admitted doubtingly by Montesquieu. (_Del\r\nl’esprit des lois_, Book xxiii. ch. 15.) Many authors have admitted\r\nthis to be fact on the authority of this great man, and then instead\r\nof investigating whether it was true or not have attempted to assign\r\nthe reasons for it. Thus the prolifick virtue of fish has been said\r\nto depend on the aromatics and other condiments with which they are\r\nprepared; on their seasoning: on the phosphorus contained in their\r\nflesh and more particularly in their milt: and by this fact, that\r\npopulations on the sea-coast live almost exclusively on fish. This has\r\nbeen carried still farther: the parts of fishes which furnish the most\r\nof the seminal material have been determined: and this property has\r\nbeen ascribed to the milt, either because the semen is here secreted,\r\nor on account of the phosphorus which Fourcroy and Vauquelin have\r\ndiscovered in it. Some fishes however are thought to induce venereal\r\npassions more than others.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to find the origin of this opinion in regard to\r\nfish but without success. In fact it has not the support of popular\r\nnotoriety which arises insensibly from daily observation. Thus\r\nBenoislon has proved directly by statistical facts that fecundity\r\nis not greater among the inhabitants of maritime coasts than among\r\nthose who live in other places. (_Bulletin de Férussac_, Jan., 1827.)\r\nVillermé has noticed that in Greenland and among the Esquimaux, who\r\nlive principally on fish, on sea-calves, that is, aliments, containing\r\nthese oily parts, which are regarded as so prolific, women have rarely\r\nmore than two or three children during their life. Besides if fish has\r\nthe property ascribed to it, why is it that during Lent, that period\r\nof the year when this form of food is most used, the procreative\r\npower should be most inactive; a fact which is proved from documents\r\ncollected in almost every country by the laborious investigations of\r\nVillermé. (_Annales d’hygiene publ._, Jan. 1831.) Hence it is extremely\r\nimprobable that fish possesses this property, which it is important to\r\nestablish in order not to discard from the regimen of youth, an article\r\nof diet which being both nutritious and slightly stimulating, is well\r\nadapted to prevent genital excitement or to subdue it.\r\n\r\nMany other articles of food beside fish have been regarded as\r\naphrodisiac. Many insect eating reptiles, a bird called torcol and\r\nnumerous insects of which it is useless to speak. Eggs have also been\r\nregarded as having the same property, and also truffles, mushrooms,\r\nartichokes, celery, cocoa and all its preparations, onions and\r\ncondiments as ginger, pepper, and vanilla, and finally certain fruits\r\nas strawberries, apricots, peaches, pineapples, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles which we have named there are certainly some which\r\nbeing heating and exciting, may cause desire although containing\r\nnothing more specific than a great many substances which are esteemed\r\nas antiaphrodisiac, because being cooling and soothing they may\r\nproduce the opposite effect. Among these latter, we find milk, which,\r\naccording to Ste. Marie, generally contributes less to form the semen\r\nthan most other articles of food. Among these also we may mention fresh\r\nvegetables and particularly the sorrel, purslain, lettuce, endive,\r\ncucumber, mushroom, melons, &c. To these may be added the flesh of\r\nyoung animals, chicken, lamb, veal, &c., and also cooling drinks,\r\nas orgeat, lemonade, &c. The regimen best adapted for appeasing all\r\ncarnal desires consists as we have seen in an antiphlogistic diet which\r\nis composed of those fluids or solids which when introduced into the\r\nstomach are digested and assimilated with the slightest possible degree\r\nof excitement and heat. This regimen is that which should be prescribed\r\nto those patients who possess a certain degree of vigor and wish to\r\nprotect themselves against urgent and dangerous desires.\r\n\r\nDifferent medicines have also been prescribed for the same purpose:\r\nmany of them act in the same manner as the articles of food we have\r\nmentioned: of this character are tisans of marshmallows, violets,\r\nbarley, emulsions, water distilled from lettuce, purslain, &c.:\r\nof a similar character are iced drinks, ice given internally, and\r\neven prepared ices. To calm the excitement of the genital organs\r\ndrugs having a positive influence on the nervous system are also\r\nadministered. Thus camphor given alone or in combination with nitre\r\nhas often been prescribed for this purpose. The special action of this\r\narticle on the urinary passages, leads to the belief that in some\r\ncases it may be useful. Primrose and St. Basil have boasted of the\r\ninternal use of cicuta for moderating too ardent desires. Opium and its\r\npreparations have been prescribed for the same purpose. The use of this\r\narticle by the Orientals and its effects upon them render us rather\r\nsuspicious of it; there may be cases however in which it is useful.\r\nBelladonna deserves more confidence. Dr. Powell, in the London medical\r\nmagazine for April, 1824, relates the case of a young girl 27 years\r\nold, who for more than three years experienced twice a month and even\r\nmore frequently violent attacks of a libidinous hysteria: her cure was\r\nattributed to a potion composed in part of the tincture of belladonna,\r\nwhich was used to such an extent as to produce dilatation of the\r\npupils. The results obtained by Chaussier, and by many others, from\r\napplying belladonna to the neck of the uterus either to combat rigidity\r\nin labor or to alleviate puerperal convulsions, lead us to think that\r\nmedicine may prove efficacious in satyriasis and nymphomania. Thridace\r\nalso may be tried in these cases, and Angelot has related a case of\r\nspermatorrhœa supervening in consequence of excesses at the table which\r\nwas cured by this remedy. Distilled cherry-tree water also might be\r\nadded which Louyer Villermay indicates as useful in nymphomania.\r\n\r\nBoracic acid, formerly termed the sedative salts of Homberg, has also\r\nbeen recommended to subdue amorous passions. This is true likewise of\r\nnitre, which, under this name, or that of Sal Prunelle and mineral\r\ncrystal, has been much esteemed as an antiaphrodisiac. The use of this\r\nremedy according to Baldassar cured the man, who demanded so earnestly\r\nthe removal of his testes, and whose case has already been mentioned:\r\nthis salt was used because Prevatius, a physician at Pavia, having\r\nadministered it to a man for an affection of the bladder rendered him\r\nimpotent. The hemp and the willow have also been recommended: Etmuller\r\nbelieves particularly in the action of this latter; and recommends the\r\nextract of its leaves, and the sap obtained from its young branches in\r\nspring. (_Trait du bon choix des medicamens_, 1710. Lyons.)\r\n\r\nBut among all drugs, those which are the longest known, and which were\r\nmost esteemed, are the _agnus castus_ or _vitex_, and the _nenuphar_.\r\nHuman credulity is severely taxed, to believe what has been said\r\nas to the virtues of these articles. The Greek women, according to\r\nDioscorides, slept during the festivals of Ceres, on the leaves of\r\nthe agnus castus to preserve their chastity. Arnaud de Villeneuve\r\nstates that an infallible mode of preserving the breast from all\r\nmen’s attempts, is to carry a knife, the handle of which is made of\r\nthis wood. Even now its leaves and seeds are used both externally\r\nand internally in monasteries to support more easily the rigors of\r\ncelibacy. At present, however, no one believes in its virtues. The\r\nsame is true of the nenuphar. Its reputation, as soothing the genital\r\norgans, belongs to the early periods of sciences. It is mentioned in\r\nDioscorides and Galen, and its history is as fabulous as that of the\r\nagnus-castus. The list of antiaphrodisiacs would terminate here, if\r\nMontegre had not mentioned a tree called mairkonsia, which grew in the\r\nEast Indies, and which was used by some fakirs to render themselves\r\nimpotent. Every day those children, who are designed to be fakirs,\r\nswallow a small roll of its leaves: the dose is gradually increased,\r\nand at the age of twenty-five, the effect is irrevocably produced. This\r\ntree is yet to be known by scientific men. (_Dict. des Se. Med._, _Art.\r\nContinence_.)\r\n\r\nBesides those articles which act as stimulants on the genital organs\r\nspecially, these latter are excited by whatever tends to increase\r\nthe sensibility in general. A great degree of susceptibility, and a\r\nmoderate development of the venereal sense, may co-exist, and are often\r\nfound combined: but this only proves that the genital apparatus may\r\nescape certain influences, and not respond to the excitements which\r\nare impressed on it. Thus, whatever _tends_ to develop, or to diminish\r\nthe sensibility of a subject, must be considered not as necessarily\r\nmodifying that of the genital organs, but as having the power to modify\r\nit, and as exercising this power in many cases.\r\n\r\nNow if we consider that the abuses of the genital organs arise most\r\ngenerally, because the sensibility of these organs has been excited\r\ntoo soon, or too vividly, we can imagine that a very great degree of\r\nsusceptibility may predispose to these abuses, and, that consequently,\r\nto prevent and repress them, we must attend to every thing which favors\r\nthe development of the genital organs. The power of sensation, like\r\nthat of thought and action, is in many respects just what it is formed.\r\nThe _education_, that is, the cultivation of these three faculties, may\r\nthen give the senses a precocious language, and become indirectly a\r\nprinciple of excess. It may also, when properly directed, be a powerful\r\nmeans of preventing any excess. Let us see then how education acts, and\r\nhow it is directed.\r\n\r\nIt is only by exercise that the faculties are cultivated. It would\r\nbe very wrong, however, to suppose that each one of them has an\r\nindividual existence, and by use may be developed separately, and\r\nindependent of the others. The human faculties seem to have a certain\r\nextent of power in common, which they divide in such a manner that one\r\ncannot increase except at the expense of the others. An individual\r\nwho possesses excessive sensibility, rarely enjoys a great degree of\r\nmuscular vigor. Those men who are noted for muscular strength, are\r\nseldom distinguished for the brilliancy of their intellect. Education\r\nthen acts in two ways: directly, by developing the faculties which it\r\nexercises, and indirectly, by opposing the progress of those which it\r\nneglects. What it gives to one, it takes from another: it is both a\r\npositive, and a negative power. As to the modes of directing it, they\r\nact by regulating the use of the three faculties during the period\r\nof life when they are forming. This is not the place to say how far\r\neducation should be carried, so that, in a physical, intellectual, and\r\nmoral point of view, it should be good: we seek only to determine what\r\nit ought to be, in order that a too vivid, or too precocious a facility\r\nto receive impressions, may not become the causes of venereal excesses.\r\n\r\nIt is not among the working classes, that those subject to hysteria and\r\nhypochondria, are most numerous. The fatigue of body, when constant,\r\ndulls the senses. On the other hand, whatever enervates, renders one\r\nsusceptible to excesses. These facts, which are generally known, and\r\nare confirmed by daily observation, ought to show the influence of\r\nexercise and rest on the venereal passion. Onanism is arrested in those\r\nchildren, much more readily, who are extremely active and always in\r\nexercise, than in those who are sedentary. The period of puberty, this\r\nemancipation of the genital organs, is later, by two or three years,\r\nin those individuals who take just enough of repose to rest them from\r\nfatigue, than in those who take exercise simply because wearied of\r\nrepose. Other things being equal, the adult who depends upon his daily\r\nlabor for his bread, thinks less of sexual pleasures than the idler.\r\nHelvetius (_de l’homme sect._ 10, _note_ 4,) attributes the lascivious\r\ntastes of the Asiatics to their idleness, and the indifference of\r\nthe Canadians to the pleasures of love, to the fatigues experienced\r\nby hunting and fishing. Villermé has attempted to show by statistics\r\nthe influence of great labor on conceptions, but has not accomplished\r\nit. He, however, is disposed to regard the influence of fatigue on\r\nthe sexual feelings, as the cause of the enormous difference said\r\nto have been observed in the Antilles, between the fecundity of the\r\nblack slaves, and that of the whites. He remembers to have read, that\r\nin 1798, at St. Domingo, three marriages of blacks produced only two\r\nchildren, while each union between whites produced three children.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from the preceding remarks to what extent exercise is\r\nuseful to young children. Unfortunately, the intellectual and moral\r\nnecessities of our age cause physical education to be sacrificed in\r\nmany respects. How many desires must necessarily be cherished, by\r\nconfining the physical activity of young people, chained down as it\r\nwere, hour after hour. How many men of mind have protested against the\r\nbrief period of recreation allowed in our schools. Mr. Taillefer has\r\ndone this in an excellent work published in 1824, on the improvement to\r\nbe introduced in schools. This is true, also, of Pavet de Courtailles\r\nand Simon, (_Hygiene des Colleges, and Hygiene de la jeunesse_,) and\r\nin America by Dr. A. Brigham, of Hartford, whose work entitled, _The\r\nInfluence of Mental Cultivation upon Health_, is full of judicious\r\nprecept and sound logic. Gymnastic exercises, which are now beginning\r\nto be generally used in boys’ schools, and to be adopted in some\r\nseminaries for young ladies, compensate in some measure for their\r\nenervating education. Simon (of Metz) asserts that masturbation,\r\nformerly so destructive in the Orphan Asylum at Berne, has been\r\nexpelled from it by introducing exercises. He adds, too, that this\r\nscourge has also disappeared from the schools of Switzerland, since\r\nmutual instruction was introduced, which, as is well known, obliges\r\nchildren to change their position frequently.\r\n\r\nA very active life may remedy a too great degree of lasciviousness.\r\nHunting, particularly, has been recommended for this purpose. ‘Diana\r\nhas been regarded as the enemy of Love,’ says Rousseau, “and the\r\nallegory is just: the languor of love only comes from sweet repose.\r\nViolent exercise extinguishes the tender emotions.” Rullier has known\r\nhunting to produce in a man forty years old, who was passionately\r\naddicted to it, a true anaphrodisia, which disappeared when the patient\r\nadopted, in accordance with the advice of his physician, another mode\r\nof life. Some exercises, however, produce a contrary effect, viz.:\r\nthose which excite the genital organs directly. Riding in a carriage,\r\nespecially if it jolts much, and still further riding on horseback,\r\nmay act in this manner. This effect was known to the ancient authors.\r\nAristotle speaks of it. All those accustomed to riding know that the\r\nmotions of the horse often produce an erection, and sometimes an\r\ninvoluntary emission of semen. A similar occurrence may take place from\r\nriding in a carriage. Serrurier has known this to happen in himself.\r\n\r\nThe sitting posture, when long continued, excites the genital organs.\r\nSimon thinks so; because this attitude, by the pain and obstruction\r\nwhich it causes to the circulation, brings the blood to the lower parts\r\nof the trunk, and keeps it there: hence, it exposes the young man to\r\nexcitement of the genital organs, and to engorgements of the spermatic\r\ncord: even hemorrhoids appear in those who ride and sit much. This\r\nauthor concludes by condemning the custom, in schools, of keeping the\r\nstudents sitting the greater part of the day. He thinks that the number\r\nof hours spent in school should be less, and that the students should\r\nstudy as many of their lessons as possible, in the erect posture. He\r\nrecommends, also, that the seats should be so constructed as not to\r\ngenerate much heat, as do those which are stuffed.\r\n\r\nThe action of intellectual labor is extremely analogous to that of\r\nmuscular exertion. Persons whose minds are much occupied, who are\r\ndevoted to their studies, are generally but slightly sensual in their\r\nfeelings. There are some literary men who thus have become prematurely\r\nimpotent. On the other hand, individuals whose minds are naturally dull\r\nand heavy, the imbeciles and idiots, are frequently remarkable for\r\ntheir extreme salacity. The cultivation of the intellect then is not in\r\nitself a predisposing cause of venereal abuses, but it may become so\r\nindirectly, either by the physical inaction which it demands, or by the\r\nnature of the ideas it excites. We have spoken of the former, and will\r\nnow consider the latter.\r\n\r\nThe moral influences, that is, those which are impressed on the senses\r\nthrough the medium of the intellect, often predispose young patients\r\nto the abuses of which we are treating. The action of these influences\r\nis direct: it is by the impressions which they develop, that they may\r\ngive to the senses the power of holding a language, and of exercising\r\na precocious influence. They are particularly to be dreaded when they\r\naddress the instinct of propagation, and excite it before the organized\r\nsystem is perfectly developed. The moral education also, that education\r\nwhich consists in keeping from the young certain impressions, does not\r\nact until their time has come, and must be considered as one of the\r\nmost efficacious modes of preventing the premature abuse of venereal\r\npleasures.\r\n\r\nNotions of love may, when acquired too soon, excite in the soul a\r\nsensation which is first vague, then more precise, and which only\r\nrequires an opportunity to become a fatal passion. Thus the reading\r\nof romances, and books which always interest the soul in love scenes\r\nwhich are painted in bright colors, ought to be strictly forbidden to\r\nyoung people. The same is true of theatrical representations. Here love\r\nis in a measure materialized: we see the persons who are animated by\r\nthis passion: they express themselves in a manner to make one really\r\nthink they feel it: they attempt by every kind of coquetry to deceive\r\nand delude the public, and even to excite desires. Art lends her aid\r\nto eloquence and gesture to move the heart, and the fear of failing to\r\nenlist the feelings, often induces the actor to overstep the bounds\r\nof nature, and then he represents libertinism, not love. Conceive of\r\nthe effect which this must produce upon one who is uninitiated, who\r\nis thus, as it were, introduced into a new world: the venereal sense\r\nbecomes excited sooner than it ought to be, and desires demand to be\r\nsatisfied before the body has attained its strength, and consequently\r\nbefore legitimate pleasures are practicable or allowable.\r\n\r\nBalls, parties, and assemblies, all opportunities of seeing the world\r\nin its gayest and most attractive attire, are dangerous to youth.\r\nGenerally speaking, the habitual intercourse of the two sexes ought\r\nto be avoided as much as possible. In a report made to the Industrial\r\nSociety of Malhouse, as to the number of hours which children ought\r\nto labor daily, the evening labor which brings the different sexes\r\ntogether in the workshops, is mentioned as a great source of trouble.\r\nOne advantage of schools is, that the different sexes are kept\r\ndistinct. In families, and we do not except those which are models of\r\nmorality, the opportunities of intercourse between boys and girls are\r\ntoo frequent. Certain emotions, of an obscure character at first, are\r\nfelt: curiosity is excited, and soon the secret of solitary indulgence\r\nis found. Young persons may also, under their paternal roof, acquire\r\ndangerous notions in regard to the material differences between the\r\nsexes, and other facts which are the consequence of them. “I do not\r\nsee,” says Rousseau, “but one mode of preserving in children their\r\ninnocence; which is, that all those around should respect and love it.”\r\nUnfortunately, the smallness of dwelling houses in cities, and other\r\nnecessities, particularly that of watching their offspring obliges\r\nparents to keep their children near them, and their curiosity being\r\nalways on the alert, often leads them to unfortunate discoveries. Abbe\r\nChappe has stated the manner in which the Samoides live in their huts,\r\nas an active cause of libertinism. These individuals do not use beds,\r\nbut lie, almost naked, on straw and on benches. The children witness\r\nmuch that should be concealed from them; become loose in their morals,\r\nand hence they have to be married early to prevent excesses. (_Travels\r\nin Siberia, Vol. 1._) If accidental observations in the most moral\r\nfamilies may be attended with the results just mentioned, what must be\r\nthe consequence of constant depraved manners; their empire is so great\r\nat this age when the mind is unexperienced, and is always ready to\r\nadopt the impressions of the moment. In pity then to youth, let every\r\nmagistrate prevent the publicity of immodesty and vice; do not let\r\nprostitution be sanctioned by the law: for when our sons and daughters\r\nare liable to find out in an instant what we have so carefully\r\nconcealed from them, the responsibility should rest not simply on those\r\nunfortunate beings who follow such a course of life, but also on the\r\npart of those who having the power to prevent it, close their eyes, and\r\npermit, or even authorize it.\r\n\r\n_Rules relating to the direct and special causes of onanism._ The habit\r\nof onanism may have three origins: it may be, 1st, that the individual\r\ndiscovers it spontaneously; 2d, that the vice may be taught him; 3d,\r\nthat being unable to satisfy his desires for coition, he seeks a\r\nresource in onanism.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that an unusual irritation of the genito-urinary\r\nmucous membrane may develop venereal excitement capable of causing\r\nsatyriasis and nymphomania. This irritation may also act in another\r\nmanner. The itching it occasions may cause the hands to be carried to\r\nthe genital organs; unknown sensations are produced, and masturbation\r\nis accidentally discovered. We see by this how necessary it is in young\r\npatients to protect these parts from all sources of itching. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, a knowledge of this vice comes from accident. Hence children at\r\nan early age should be taught habits of modesty; all handling of the\r\ngenital organs should be prohibited. Children should not be allowed to\r\nkeep their hands in their pockets. Neither should they be left alone\r\nlong: the necessity of observing, which is so vivid at their age,\r\nis exercised on themselves, when they find nothing else to interest\r\nthem, and they sometimes make dangerous observations. It is in bed\r\nparticularly that this evil is most liable to happen; hence they should\r\nbe taken from their beds as soon as they awake, and the hour of rest\r\nshould not long precede that of sleep. Many children have been led to\r\nonanism by their efforts to resist the wish to urinate. The pressure\r\nexercised on the penis by pressing the thighs firmly against each\r\nother, has excited sensations which they have attempted to re-produce.\r\nWe mention this cause of onanism as being much more common than is\r\ngenerally supposed.\r\n\r\nThere is another cause, which is much more rare, but which deserves to\r\nbe known: domestic animals, as cats and dogs, have sometimes licked the\r\nsexual parts of young children, particularly girls, and have excited\r\na sense which ought to sleep. Hufeland publishes a remarkable case of\r\nthis character in support of some peculiar views on venereal disease,\r\nand adds that Ruggieri some years before, published in the medical\r\njournals, a case where, by the licking of a dog, ulcers of a bad\r\ncharacter were developed in the genitals of two old maids. (_Bibliot.\r\nMed._, May, 1821, p. 250.)\r\n\r\nMost frequently, however, the habit of onanism arises from direct\r\nprovocation, from instruction. Sometimes this provocation can be\r\nattributed only to imprudence. Thus nurses sometimes titillate the\r\ngenital organs in children to stop their cries. We have already stated,\r\nfrom Biett, the instance of a young girl who had thus contracted\r\nthis bad habit, and who was cured by the amputation of the clitoris:\r\nthis case arose probably only from ignorance. Sometimes, however,\r\nservants teach their masters’ children from wilfulness. One should be\r\nparticularly careful of female servants, as it is to them that young\r\nchildren are generally entrusted. Male domestics are generally to be\r\nfeared, only for those young persons who are near the age of puberty.\r\nThe wish to please their young master, often induces them to give the\r\nmost disgusting lessons. Most frequently, however, these lessons come\r\nfrom their associates, the older boys teaching those who are younger.\r\n\r\nIf among young patients onanism is practised for itself, it is\r\nafterward only an apology for the want of more legitimate enjoyments.\r\nCelibacy, in adults, is with some few exceptions the only cause of\r\nonanism. This practice, and others still more revolting, are common\r\namong monastic orders, as the consequence and punishment of vows made\r\ncontrary to the laws of nature. Polygamy, the quasi celibacy to which\r\nthe females of many countries submit, also causes great derangements\r\nin the system. A kind of consumption has been described to which the\r\nTurkish women are subject, and which can be traced to no other cause.\r\n(_Journal de Med., Vol._ 44, p. 539.) It is in prisons, however, where\r\nthere is no moral feeling, that this vice is most prevalent. Villermé\r\nremarks, that the amount of this vice in prisons, is almost incredible.\r\nYoung and old abandon themselves to it so freely, that the physicians\r\nof the prisons of the department of the Seine, attribute the frequency\r\nof pulmonary consumption, of cramps in the stomach, muscular debility,\r\nweakness of sight, and of the intellectual faculties, to this cause\r\nalone. This physician considers onanism as one of the causes of the\r\nexcessive mortality existing in the depots of mendicity. (_Dict. des\r\nSc. Med._, _art. Prison_.)\r\n\r\nSailors also often abandon themselves during their long voyages to\r\nthis vice. Many adults, and particularly females, seek in solitary\r\nindulgence a compensation for the restraints imposed on them by\r\nlaws and customs. Even animals indulge. Montegre has published some\r\ninteresting details on this subject. (_Dict. des Sc. Med._, _art.\r\nContinence_.)\r\n\r\nWe have said that onanism is performed so easily that it is much more\r\nto be feared than sexual intercourse. If then the physician has to\r\nchoose between the two, he ought not to hesitate. In human things\r\nwe cannot always choose between an injury and a benefit. Sometimes\r\nthe selection is between a greater and a lesser evil. We may then\r\nwithout detriment to physical and moral laws, counsel the young man\r\nwho indulges in onanism, to gratify his feelings in a less dangerous\r\nmanner. This also was Rousseau’s opinion. He says, in his Emile, “If\r\na tyrant must conquer you, I would prefer to yield you to that from\r\nwhich you can be released most easily: and you can be weaned from\r\nfemales more readily than from yourself.” The physician in these cases\r\nshould recommend marriage.\r\n\r\nThis advice, too, is sanctioned by experience. Many young men after\r\nindulging in sexual intercourse, have commenced onanism; despising the\r\nlatter, after exercising the former. “We have known a father,” say\r\nFournier and Begin, “who finding his son disobeyed his advice, married\r\nhim, and with success.” The same remedy has often been tried, and with\r\ngood effect. A single coition has often sufficed to appease excessive\r\nardor in females, and we could state several cases of nymphomania which\r\nhave been thus immediately cured. Pregnancy also has been followed by\r\nthe same results: this fact was known to the ancients and is mentioned\r\nin a work ascribed to Hippocrates. Panarolus, Matthew de Grado, and\r\nothers, have related cases of females affected with nymphomania, who\r\nare never calm except during pregnancy. The following fact, observed by\r\nEsquirol, shows the influence of coition and pregnancy on the genital\r\nsystem. “A strong and healthy girl, of good family, nineteen years\r\nold, became affected with hysteria, with violent and almost constant\r\nconvulsions. After a long and ineffectual course of medical treatment,\r\nthis young woman disappeared from her father’s house, and all inquiries\r\nfor her were in vain. After a few months, Esquirol, passing in the\r\nevening through a noted and dissipated quarter of Paris, was stopped by\r\na female, whom he recognised to be his patient. On inquiring what she\r\nwas doing, she answered, “Getting well.” For eighteen months this girl\r\nwas a prostitute of the lowest order. She miscarried twice, and finally\r\nreturned to her father’s house perfectly well. This woman is now\r\nmarried, a mother, and extremely circumspect in her conduct.” (_Dict.\r\ndes Sc. Med._, _art. Continence_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. SECOND INDICATION. TO RESIST THE DESIRE OF ONANISM.\r\n\r\nWhen a desire can be satisfied, and is not, it is because the will is\r\nenchained, or this is distracted by circumstances more powerful than\r\ndesire. Thus then it is possible to inspire an individual with certain\r\nfears, or by distracting his thoughts to make his will resist his\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nThe fear of God and his ministers may have great influence over the\r\nminds of many, and preserve strict continence. The fear of confession\r\nhas often, to our knowledge, produced a denial of desire in young\r\npersons. At the present day, however, this latter influence cannot be\r\ndepended on much, and confessors, by their imprudent questions, have\r\noften excited curiosity in hearts yet innocent.\r\n\r\nThe fear of transgressing the rules of modesty taught in youth,\r\nrestrains some individuals. Others abstain because they fear the\r\ncorrection and reproaches of a father, and think on the shame with\r\nwhich they would be covered were their secret known. Chastisement has\r\nsometimes had the effect of rendering the guilty ones very circumspect.\r\nBut of all fears, that which has produced the most effect on onanists,\r\nis the fear of disease and death.\r\n\r\nOnanists rarely believe what is told them by parents and others, as to\r\nthe dangers of their course, but place more credit on what they read\r\nin books; and of these, Tissot is the only one which possesses much\r\nreputation. It has been much read, and although attended with great\r\ngood effects, it has not always been useful. Many think its statements\r\nexaggerated, and therefore injurious. We have known it to fail entirely\r\nof its desired purpose, and to cause deplorable effects. On the whole,\r\nhowever, it has done much good, which it would be unjust not to\r\nacknowledge. At the same time, we must say, that a knowledge of the\r\nreproaches against Tissot, and the desire to avoid them, have had no\r\ninfluence over a word of the present treatise. In composing it we have\r\nbeen actuated by a desire to tell the truth, and have more than once\r\nremarked that we must not judge of the common effects of onanism by the\r\ncases which have been published, as those only which are very severe,\r\nappear in print. We have also said that the most common effects of\r\nonanism consist rather in certain vitiations of temperament, than in\r\ndiseases having a precise form, and a distinct place in the systems\r\nof nosology. We have also shown how rapidly the health is generally\r\nrestored when indulgence in onanism ceases. But this was done not to\r\nexercise any influence over the minds of those who might read the book,\r\nbut simply to do justice to the truth.\r\n\r\nThe word of a physician may frequently however produce a change in\r\nthe patient; more frequently than the reading of a book. He should\r\nnot hesitate to speak boldly, for if it be requisite he can afterward\r\nmodify his opinion. The effect of an opinion as follows, “In three\r\nmonths you will be a dead man” is often very great. The onanist\r\ntrembles and becomes pale: his heart beats quickly, his strength fails.\r\nDo not regret it, it is not by encouragement that you will save him\r\nfrom himself. Add however that in a few months he will be a well man,\r\nprovided he will renounce his bad habits. These words of hope will\r\nconsole him and encourage him to resist his evil desires. Frequently\r\nhowever the impression caused by this language is soon effaced. In this\r\ncase another remedy must be sought for. The language and tone of the\r\nphysician too should vary according to the person addressed; but he\r\nshould always present the certainty of death if the vice is continued,\r\nand that of relief if it be arrested.\r\n\r\nSometimes the onanist leaves his old habit very gradually, a course\r\nwhich is recommended by Swediaur. This course may be pursued for two\r\nreasons: the first is that it is more easy to quit this habit by\r\ndegrees than to break it off violently: the second that it is not\r\nalways prudent to leave off habits suddenly even if they are bad.\r\nPersons have sometimes been blinded by being taken from their dungeons\r\ntoo suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen a young man however finds himself unable to resist the force of\r\nhis desires notwithstanding the perusal of books and the advice of\r\nhis physician, there is still one resource, which is the sight of\r\nan onanist dying. Approach and look at him: he was recently healthy\r\nand his prospects bright. He indulged in onanism: see what he is now;\r\nfriends and physicians remonstrated with him but in vain; he would\r\nlisten to nothing, he believed nothing. Now however he believes, but\r\nit is too late, for in a few days his earthly career will be closed.\r\nIf terror does not affect him who witnesses this doleful picture you\r\ncannot produce it. A surgeon named Bertrand aware of the power of this\r\nmode of instruction constructed in wax two figures which represented\r\nonanists of both sexes. These figures were exhibited to those suspected\r\nof indulging in onanism and produced it is said very beneficient\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe ancients and we will cite Avicenna, and Paul of Egina, recommend\r\nthat we should attempt to excite in the minds of those addicted to this\r\nvice an interest about external objects. _Distraction_ is then a mode\r\nwhich may be usefully recommended to those onanists over whom their\r\ndesires have not much power. Travelling, study, recreation, in fact\r\nevery thing which can give the mind a strong and new direction, should\r\nbe recommended, and may have the effect of distracting the onanist from\r\nhis bad habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. THIRD INDICATION. REMOVE FROM THOSE WHO HAVE THE WISH TO\r\nMASTURBATE THE POWER OF DOING SO.\r\n\r\nMasturbation is possible only under the two following conditions: first\r\nthere must be an opportunity to indulge in secret; next there must\r\nbe a possibility of indulging. Hence by frustrating these conditions\r\nwe can prevent onanism, the wishes of the onanist to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for onanism are all embraced under one term,\r\n_isolation_. It is necessary for the onanist to be alone. Hence\r\nwatchfulness, that precaution which makes the young man constantly\r\nobserves, which exposes him every moment to detection and consequently\r\nto shame, to reproaches and to punishment for his fault, is a powerful\r\nmeans of preventing it.\r\n\r\nWatchfulness should be particularly practised over young people, when\r\nthey are undressed, in bed, in the bath or in the privy. Hence the\r\nyoung patient should undress, go to bed and rise under your inspection.\r\nIf this be not sufficient, he should share your bed. This measure is\r\nfrequently the only way to prevent onanism. In large boarding schools\r\nthere should be no private rooms: the sleeping chambers should be\r\nextensive, and a lamp, which would give sufficient light to assist your\r\nwatchfulness, but not enough to prevent sleep, should burn in it all\r\nnight. The masters and those who have charge of the pupils ought to\r\nexamine in silence at different hours and the most perfect quiet should\r\nexist in the apartment. Here too the hours of retirement and of rising\r\nshould be calculated according to the ages, so that the suspected or\r\nguilty might never go to bed except to sleep. Be watchful of those who\r\nstay long in privies: those however with ample accommodations are not\r\nso dangerous as those which are single. In some schools the doors of\r\nthe privies are open at the top, so that an adult can look into them.\r\nNeed we add that persons who are suspected should be watched in the\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nOnanism is executed with the hand and thighs on the sexual parts or\r\nby rubbing these parts against external bodies. Different modes have\r\nbeen proposed to obviate and prevent these. The most simple of all is\r\nto oblige the children to keep their hands out of bed. This plan when\r\nit can be observed is often sufficient, particularly in boys. Besides\r\nthis we knew of only one remedy, the purpose of what can be concealed,\r\nviz., the application of a cold cataplasm to the sexual parts, a plan\r\nwe have recommended several times. Pavet de Courtielle proposes the use\r\nof a chemise reaching below the feet and which is drawn together at the\r\nbottom: this remedy may be efficacious. The remedies which remain to\r\nbe treated of are essentially coercive: hence the chance of success is\r\nsmaller the older and stronger the patients are.\r\n\r\nThe hands may be tied to keep them from the sexual organs, and the feet\r\nalso may be tied so as to keep the thighs separated. The child too may\r\nbe placed in a straight waistcoat fastened behind, which may force the\r\narms to rest on the chest. Different apparatus has been contrived also\r\nto keep the thighs asunder. One is composed of thick pieces of cork\r\nwhich are attached to the inside of the thighs. Drawers opening behind\r\nare sometimes used: these serve to imprison the lower part of the trunk.\r\n\r\nA kind of truss is sometimes used to preserve the sexual parts from\r\nexternal contact. The principal piece of this is of metal, either\r\nsilver or tin: for females its form is triangular, and for boys\r\nit represents a sort of mould, in which the penis and scrotum may\r\nbe placed: the bandage is kept in place by springs, like those of\r\nherniary bandages. To add to the security of this apparatus it is\r\nsometimes applied to a dress which opens only behind. In young and\r\nfeeble children these means are exceedingly efficacious, as experience\r\nhas proved. The art of the onanist has even sometimes evaded these\r\nbandages. The following case occurred in the practice of Reveille\r\nPariset; a little girl 7 years old, whose health failed every day\r\nhaving been detected in onanism, her mother instead of reproaching her,\r\ngave her to understand that it was the custom to apply a bandage to\r\ngirls of her age. This bandage was fitted very accurately and attained\r\nthe purpose desired; the health of the child being rapidly established.\r\nSoon however the symptoms reappeared and more violently than before.\r\nThe bandage was examined and it was found to be undisturbed. She\r\nhowever was watched and it was found that she used a quill for the\r\npurposes of onanism, which she slipped in under the bandage. After\r\nthis, the mother stayed with her daughter all the time, and by her\r\nvigilance the child was saved.\r\n\r\nThese mechanical bandages have other inconveniences which limit their\r\nuse. First they cannot be employed in boarding schools as they become\r\nthe subject of remark; and then they keep up in the genital organs\r\na constant heat, irritation and moisture. The edges of the principal\r\npiece also may cause deep excoriations. For all this, however they are\r\noften useful and ought not to be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE MODE OF REPAIRING THE INJURIES ARISING FROM VENEREAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn therapeutics we proceed in two ways; sometimes tracing the symptoms\r\nto their cause, we attempt to destroy this cause in the organ in which\r\nit is situated, and sometimes we attend only to symptoms. The same plan\r\nis applicable to the abuses of the genital organs, which as we have\r\nalready seen forms a real disease.\r\n\r\nThe most efficient way to arrest the evil caused by these abuses, is\r\nto stop them. When this is done, order is established very rapidly.\r\nHence the preservative means are in our view better than any remedial\r\nmeasures. Often however, when these excesses have been frequently\r\nrepeated and long continued, the genital organs continue without\r\nprovocation the work which was commenced by onanism. Thus _involuntary\r\npollutions_ keep up and increase a degree of exhaustion and other\r\ncomplaints which would otherwise disappear. In this case the treatment\r\nto be followed is to arrest the pollutions. These generally result, as\r\nwe have said, from an inflammation of the seminal passages analogous\r\nto that existing in the urethra in blenorrhœa. This fact has lately\r\nbeen demonstrated anatomically by Lallemand and M. Davila. Hence the\r\ntreatment of involuntary spermatorrhœa resembles in many respects that\r\nof chronic catarrh. The following are the principal remedies to be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nFirst must be placed cold applications to the genital organs; of these\r\npure water and ice are more generally and successfully employed. In\r\nusing these, Coelius Aurelian employed sponges. Wichmann wet cloths,\r\nand Ste. Marie, who preferred ice, used a bladder. Cold washes and\r\naffusions to the part and cold douches to the perineum, and hipbaths\r\nand seabaths have also been used. Lallemand who repudiates enemata too\r\nhot or warm thinks that those which are cold may be useful. Sulphurous\r\nbaths have likewise been employed by Lallemand, in the manner described\r\nin his work in diseases of the genito-urinary organs. Davila in his\r\nthesis relates instances cured in this mode, and also the case of a\r\nyoung man who was cured of a diurnal pollution by introducing into the\r\nurethra a sound, which was retained there as long as the patient could\r\nbear it. Lallemand entertains the same opinion, and has also employed\r\nacupuncture and he says with success. He has known patients who after\r\nthe application of needles between the posterior parts of the bursœ and\r\nthe anus, have passed three or four months without pollutions.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners have succeeded by directing their remedies to the\r\ncerebellum and the spinal marrow.\r\n\r\nMany medicines have been administered internally for losses of semen.\r\nThose most in repute are the preparations of iron and quinine,\r\neither separately or together. Ferruginous waters, particularly\r\nthose of Spa, and the oxides of iron, have often been used. Wichmann\r\nrecommends several glasses of Spa water every morning combined with\r\nsome preparation of cinchona: Serrurier has related a case showing\r\nthe efficacy of this treatment. Lallemand thinks that cinchona and\r\ngenerally all remedies which contain tannin, only benefit temporarily.\r\nMany authors also disapprove of the use of astringents and tonics in\r\nspermatorrhœa, attributing to them among other inconveniences, that of\r\ncausing constipation.\r\n\r\nMany narcotic substances have also been used. We have related a case\r\nwhere thridace has succeeded. Belladonna also might be useful. In a\r\npatient mentioned by Serrurier, opium seems to have exasperated the\r\ncomplaint. Davila however thinks that opiates have been prescribed with\r\nsuccess: but he dreads the constipation which they generally cause.\r\nOther remedies as the mineral acids, phosphoric lemonade, lime water,\r\nsome preparations of lead, magnesia, ipecac, &c. have been used. Might\r\nnot advantage be derived from the use of balsam copaiva and pulverized\r\ncubebs in some cases of spermatorrhœa.\r\n\r\nWe have already made some remarks on regimen, when speaking of the mode\r\nof avoiding or calming the venereal sense, and our rules for restoring\r\nindividuals exhausted by onanism, will be stated hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe object of the treatment stated is to remedy the disease, caused\r\nby the loss of semen. A mode has been proposed by Wender to prevent\r\nthis physically; this consists in the compression of the canal of the\r\nurethra: it is accomplished by means of a pair of forceps made of\r\nflexible wood, six to seven inches long, and from twelve to eighteen\r\nlines thick. This forceps is used by passing the penis between its two\r\nbranches, one being above, and the other below; the two extremities\r\nare then tied with a cord. In this manner the penis is compressed and\r\nslightly confined; which is sufficient, says Wender, to remove all\r\nvoluptuous sensation from this part, and to arrest the pollution. He\r\nhas given the details of a case obtained by these means, and by the\r\nproper administration of tonics.\r\n\r\nWender’s forceps may have several inconveniences, and may frequently\r\nfail of the proposed end. But has it not been too much ridiculed, and\r\nis it not susceptible of improvement? Serrurier thinks that the idea\r\nmay be turned to advantage, and Reveillé Pariset assures us that he has\r\nused it twice in cases of pollution, and with success. (_Revue. Med._,\r\n_April_, 1828, p. 94.)\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned the course to pursue in order to reach the seat of the\r\ndisease, that is, the voluntary and involuntary pollutions, let us now\r\nspeak of their effects. One of two things must happen; either these\r\npollutions pursue their work, or finally the economy becomes insensible\r\nto their action. The first supposition is that least favorable to\r\nsuccess: the physician prescribes for effects while the cause continues\r\nto act; he _doctors_, as it is called, for symptoms; and it is the\r\nsame as if one should attempt to cure gastritis or pleuritis, without\r\nattending to the pleura or stomach. This, however, is no reason for\r\nabstaining completely from treatment. We may also sometimes retard the\r\nprogress of the disease, or calm any painful and disquieting symptom.\r\nThe physician has a much better prospect of success, when there is no\r\nlonger a habit to destroy the health, and when no pollutions occur.\r\nWe shall not attempt in this place to give the treatment proper for\r\nthe different diseases which may be produced by onanism. Myelitis,\r\ndementia, amaurosis, epilepsy, &c., &c., whether caused by onanism or\r\nnot, require special remedies, which are stated in works which treat of\r\nthese affections. We would remark, however, that when these diseases\r\nare caused by onanism, it is perfectly futile for the physician to\r\nattempt to treat the disease, unless the habit of self pollution be\r\narrested. In this place we will only mention that consumption, that\r\nexhaustion, in fact, that deterioration, which we have described in the\r\nthird chapter of our first part.\r\n\r\nOnanistic deterioration presents two very distinct phenomena: 1st,\r\nthe consumption of the strength; 2d, the excitement of the senses.\r\nThus, then, to restore the strength without increasing, and even, if\r\npossible, to diminish the general disposition to receive impressions,\r\nare the two indications to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut before commencing, it is well to remember that this cannot be done\r\nin a few days. A disease which is gradual in its appearance is removed\r\nin the same manner. The physician who would attempt to hurry it by\r\nemploying active remedies, would soon exhaust the system.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of reparation is found in diet: the body must be\r\nrecruited by food, and inasmuch as only those things are nutritious\r\nwhich are digested, the first rule to be observed is, that all the\r\nconditions of good digestion are properly observed. Inasmuch as these\r\nconditions present nothing special in respect to onanists, we shall\r\nbe very brief, referring to our previous remarks on this subject. It\r\nmust first be considered, that in patients accustomed to onanism the\r\ndigestive functions are always deranged, or are liable to be so.\r\n\r\nThe slightest error in diet may aggravate this state considerably;\r\nwhich is, in itself, an evil, and may add to the trouble of cure.\r\nHence, if the rules of a good regimen should always be vigorously\r\nobserved, this necessity is still more imperious when patients indulge\r\nin onanism.\r\n\r\nEvery article of food which is difficult to digest should be forbidden,\r\nand among articles which can be digested, those should be selected\r\nwhich contain the most nourishment, and are the least exciting. Thus\r\ncondiments, which are but slightly nutritious, and are very exciting,\r\nought never to be used, unless they are indispensably necessary to\r\ndigestion, and then only in very small quantities. Milk is very\r\nnutritious, and does not excite; it should therefore be preferred\r\nby all those who are exhausted. If cow’s milk be found difficult of\r\ndigestion, asses’ milk and that of woman has been recommended. But if\r\nthis article be difficult of digestion, it should be prohibited, for\r\nthen it is injurious. The flesh of young animals, particularly veal\r\nand poultry, is good; but beef and mutton is still better, for they\r\ncontain more nutritious matter in a smaller compass. These articles,\r\nwhen roasted or broiled, are better than when boiled. Fresh fish is\r\ngenerally a suitable article of food: we allude to those kinds which\r\nare easily digested, as shad, perch, &c. Soups, especially those of\r\nbeef, turtle, and the different broths, should always, in order to be\r\ndigested, be mingled with solid articles of food, and should even take\r\ntheir place, if these latter cannot be digested.\r\n\r\nFarinaceous substances, and especially bread, rice, potatoe, &c., are\r\nvery suitable, because they are nutritious, and but slightly stimulant;\r\nbut they are often bad to digest.\r\n\r\nThe rule _little and often_, is the rule to follow, in regard to the\r\ndivision of food. The patient has always taken too much food: if he\r\nfeels perfectly satisfied, or if he experiences any inconvenience\r\nafter it, the quantity of nourishment should be so regulated that\r\nnothing of this kind could occur. The meals should be taken frequently,\r\nonly because they are small. We prefer to give broth warm, or more\r\nfrequently still, cold, by spoonfuls, and have seen a benefit from it.\r\n\r\nDrinks are not very nutritious, and generally stimulate much. Those\r\nwhich are given to strengthen, only do so for a few moments. They\r\nexcite, and do not nourish. If the patient takes them to quench\r\nthirst, he should take as little as possible, for they also must be\r\ndigested. In this respect wines may be useful. To choose among them,\r\nthe experience of the patient must be consulted. A general rule governs\r\nthe use of drinks at meals, viz.: to attain the proposed end with the\r\nsmallest quantity of drink. Very dry wines, liquors, coffee, tea, &c.,\r\nought not to be permitted, unless absolutely necessary to digestion.\r\nThe use of Selzer water, and particularly of Spa water, may be very\r\nadvantageous. Very cold drinks are often the only ones suitable to the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nMedicines have often been administered, either to strengthen the\r\nsystem, or to re-establish the digestive powers. Of these, the most\r\nuseful are preparations of iron, quinine, and bitters. It is possible\r\nto improve the digestive organs with these drugs, and also with others;\r\nbut this is not the place to give the treatment of diseases which are\r\nmarked by difficulty of digestion. I know that some tonics may be used\r\nwith great advantage, especially if they are given in such doses as to\r\nhave no direct and immediate effect, particularly if their local action\r\non the stomach and intestines be not too powerful.\r\n\r\nVery cold baths, like every remedy capable of having an intense effect,\r\nshould be forbidden to patients exhausted by onanism. But if the baths\r\nare simply cold, and particularly if they are taken in running water,\r\nor in the sea, they may strengthen the constitution. Dry, or aromatic\r\nfrictions on the limbs, or along the vertebral column, are useful. The\r\nexercise should be moderate exercise, for too much fatigue exhausts\r\nthe strength, instead of increasing it, and might excite or hasten the\r\ndevelopment of one of the diseases produced by onanism. A pure and dry\r\nair, like that breathed in hilly countries, may also have a favorable\r\ninfluence on the economy generally, or on digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages may seem to many of our readers more particularly\r\nadapted to France; and it may be presumed that onanism is not so\r\nfrequent in America. This however is a mistake: an able writer in that\r\nvaluable periodical, the Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, when treating\r\non the subject remarks as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The pernicious and debasing practice of MASTURBATION is a more common\r\nand extensive evil with youth of both sexes, than is usually supposed.\r\nThe influence of this habit upon both mind and body, severe as it has\r\nbeen considered, and greatly as it has been deprecated, is altogether\r\nmore prejudicial than the public, and, as is believed, even the medical\r\nprofession, are aware.\r\n\r\n“A great number of the evils which come upon the young at and after the\r\nage of puberty, arise from _masturbation_, persisted in, so as to waste\r\nthe vital energies and enervate the physical and mental powers of man.\r\nNot less does it sap the foundation of moral principles, and blast the\r\nfirst budding of manly and honorable feelings which were exhibiting\r\nthemselves in the opening character of the young.\r\n\r\n“Many of the weaknesses commonly attributed to growth and the changes\r\nin the habit by the important transformation from adolescence to\r\nmanhood, are justly referable to this practice.\r\n\r\n“This change requires all the energy of the system, greatly increased\r\nas it is at this period of life, which if undisturbed will bring about\r\na vigorous and healthy condition of both the mental and physical powers.\r\n\r\n“If masturbation be commenced at this period, it cannot fail to\r\ninterrupt essentially this important process; and if continued, will\r\ninevitably impress imbecility on the constitution, not less apparent in\r\nthe body than the mind, preventing, as it will not fail to do, the full\r\ndevelopment of the powers of both.\r\n\r\n“The individual becomes feeble, is unable to labor with accustomed\r\nvigor, or to apply his mind to study; his step is tardy and weak, he is\r\ndull, irresolute, engages in his sports with less energy than usual,\r\nand avoids social intercourse; when at rest he instinctively assumes\r\na lolling or recumbent posture, and if at labor or at his games takes\r\nevery opportunity to lie down or sit in a bent and curved position.\r\nThe cause of these infirmities is _often_ unknown to the subject of\r\nthem, and _more generally_ to the friends; and to labor, or study, or\r\ngrowth, is attributed all the evils which arise from the practice of\r\nthis secret vice, which if persisted in will hardly fail to result in\r\nirremediable disease or hopeless idiocy. The natural consequence of\r\nindulgence in this, as in most other vices, is an increased propensity\r\nto them. This is particularly true of masturbation. In my intercourse\r\nwith this unfortunate class of individuals, I have found a large\r\nproportion of them wholly ignorant of the causes of their complaints,\r\nand if not too far gone the abandonment of the habit has, after awhile,\r\nremoved all the symptoms and resulted in confirmed health.\r\n\r\n“One young man, now under my care, was first arrested in his career\r\nby reading the chapters on the subject in the Young Man’s Guide. For\r\nmany months, he has totally abstained from the practice, and yet he\r\nis feeble, depressed, irresolute, and unable to fix his attention to\r\nany subject, or to pursue any active employment. But he is steadily\r\nconvalescing, and will doubtless recover.\r\n\r\n“If the symptoms above enumerated do not lead in any way to a\r\ndiscontinuance of the habit, other symptoms more formidable, and more\r\ndifficult of cure, will present themselves. The back becomes lame and\r\nweak, the limbs tremble, the digestion is disturbed, and costiveness\r\nor diarrhœa, or an alternation of them, take place. The head becomes\r\npainful--the heart palpitates--the respiration is easily hurried--the\r\nmind is depressed and gloomy--the temper becomes irritable--the sleep\r\ndisturbed, and is attended by lascivious dreams, and not unfrequently\r\nnocturnal pollutions. With these symptoms the pulse becomes small, the\r\nextremities cold and damp; the countenance is downcast, the eye without\r\nnatural lustre; shamefacedness is apparent, as if the unfortunate\r\nvictim was conscious of his degraded condition.\r\n\r\n“The stomach often rejects food, and is affected with acidity, and\r\nloathing; the nervous system becomes highly irritable; neuralgia, tabes\r\ndorsalis, pulmonary consumption, or fatal marasmus, terminate the\r\nsuffering, or else insanity and deplorable idiocy are the fatal result.\r\nLong before such an event, the mind is enfeebled, the memory impaired,\r\nand the power of fixing the attention wholly lost. These are symptoms\r\nwhich should awaken our attention to the danger of the case, and which\r\nshould induce us to sound the alarm, and if possible arrest the victim\r\nfrom the inevitable consequences of persisting in the habit.\r\n\r\n“In females, leucorrhœa is often induced by masturbation, and I doubt\r\nnot incontinence of urine, stranguary, prolapsus uteri, disease of the\r\nclitoris, and many other diseases, both local and general, which have\r\nbeen attributed to other causes.\r\n\r\n“It is often difficult to obtain information on the subject of\r\nmasturbation. Where it is suspected by the physician, the friends are\r\nwholly ignorant on the subject, and the individual, suffering, is not\r\nready to acknowledge a practice which he is conscious is filthy in the\r\nextreme, although he may have had no suspicions of its deleterious\r\ninfluence upon his health.\r\n\r\n“It is not sufficient that we know the consequences of masturbation,\r\nfor these are often irremediable disease; we ought to know the symptoms\r\nof its commencement, of the incipient stages of those diseases which\r\nresult from it, as well as the influence which the moderate practice of\r\nit will have upon the physical and mental stamina of the man--for it is\r\nnot too much to say that the practice cannot be followed by either sex,\r\neven in a moderate way, without injury, especially by the young.\r\n\r\n“Nature designs that this drain upon the system should be reserved\r\nto mature age, and even then that it be made but sparingly. Sturdy\r\nmanhood, in all its vigor, loses its energy and bends under the too\r\nfrequent expenditure of this important secretion; and no age or\r\ncondition will protect a man from the danger of unlimited indulgence,\r\nlegally and naturally exercised.\r\n\r\n“In the young, however, its influence is much more seriously felt; and\r\neven those who have indulged so cautiously as not to break down the\r\nhealth or the mind, cannot know how much their physical energy, mental\r\nvigor, or moral purity, have been affected by the indulgence.\r\n\r\n“_Nothing short of total abstinence can save those who have become\r\nthe victims of it._ In this indulgence, no half way course will ever\r\nsubdue the disease, or remove the effect of the habit from the system.\r\nTotal abstinence is the only remedy. If the constitution is not\r\nfatally impaired--if organic disease has not taken place, this remedy\r\nwill prove effectual, and must be adopted, especially in all cases in\r\nwhich the effects are visible, or the consequences cannot fail to be\r\nultimately fatal.\r\n\r\n“This means of cure may be seconded by others, which may be found\r\nnecessary to remove the effects upon the physical system. Suffice\r\nit to remark here, that total abstinence, in an aggravated form of\r\nmasturbation, is not easily effected. Slight irritation will produce\r\nan expenditure of the secretion quite involuntary, and spontaneous\r\nemissions and nocturnal pollution may for a long time prolong the\r\ndanger, and prevent that renovation of the powers which would\r\notherwise be the result of the good resolution of the victim of the\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\n“No cause is more influential in producing insanity, and, in a special\r\nmanner, perpetuating the disease, than masturbation. The records of the\r\ninstitutions give an appalling catalogue of cases attributed to this\r\ncause; and yet such records do not show nearly all the cases which are\r\njustly ascribable to it. For it is so obscure, and so secret in its\r\noperation, that the friends in almost all cases are wholly ignorant of\r\nit. It is in a few cases only, where the practice of the vice becomes\r\nshamefully notorious, that friends are willing to allow its agency\r\nin the production of any disease, particularly insanity; and yet no\r\ncause operates more directly upon the mind and the feeling. The mental\r\nenergies are prostrated by the habit in innumerable cases, long before\r\nthe delusions of insanity appear. Indeed there are many cases, in\r\nwhich insanity does not intervene between the incipient stages of that\r\nmental and physical imbecility, which comes early upon the victim of\r\nmasturbation, and the most deplorable and hopeless idiocy, in which it\r\nfrequently results.\r\n\r\n“This is perhaps peculiar to this cause of idiocy. I know of no other\r\nwhich does not produce the ravings and illusions of insanity, or the\r\ngloomy musings, agitations and alarms of melancholy, before the mind is\r\nlost in idiotism. But the victim of masturbation passes from one degree\r\nof imbecility to another, till all the powers of the system, mental,\r\nphysical and moral, are blotted out forever!\r\n\r\n“This is not, however, always the case. In some individuals there is\r\nall the raving of the most furious mania, or the deep and cruel torture\r\nof hapless melancholy, before the mind is obliterated and the energies\r\nof the system forever prostrated.\r\n\r\n“There are other circumstances attending the insanity from\r\nmasturbation, which render this the most distressing form of mental\r\ndisease. I allude to the difficulty of breaking up the habit while\r\nlaboring under this malady. When insanity is once produced by it, it\r\nis nearly hopeless, because the cause of disease is redoubled and\r\ngenerally perpetuated. The libidinous desires are greatly increased,\r\nand the influence of self restraint cannot be brought sufficiently\r\ninto action to prevent the constant, daily, and I might say almost\r\nhourly recurrence of the practice. Thus the cause is perpetuated; and\r\nin spite of every effort, the disease increases, the powers of body\r\nand mind fail together, and are lost in the most deplorable, hopeless,\r\ndisgusting fatuity! And yet the practice is not abandoned. All the\r\nremaining energies of animal life seem to be concentrated in these\r\norgans, and all the remaining power of gratification left is in the\r\nexercise of this no longer secret, but loathsome and beastly habit.\r\n\r\n“Those cases of insanity arising from other known causes, in which\r\nmasturbation is a symptom, are rendered more hopeless by this\r\ncircumstance. It is a counteracting influence to all the means of cure\r\nemployed, either moral or medicinal, and coinciding as it does with\r\nwhatever other causes may have had an agency in producing disease,\r\nrenders the case almost hopeless. Of the number of the insane that\r\nhave come under the observation of the writer (and that number is not\r\nsmall,) few, very few have recovered, who have been in the habit of\r\nthis evil practice; and still fewer, I might say almost none, have\r\nrecovered, in which insanity or idiocy has followed the train of\r\nsymptoms enumerated in a former paper, indicating the presence of the\r\nhabit, and its debilitating influence upon the minds and bodies of the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n“Most of the cases of insanity from this cause commence early in life;\r\neven confirmed and hopeless idiocy has been the melancholy consequence,\r\nbefore the victim had reached his twentieth year.\r\n\r\n“Of eighty males, insane, that have come under the observation of the\r\nwriter, and who have been particularly examined and watched, with\r\nreference to ascertaining the proportion that practised masturbation,\r\nsomething more than a quarter were found to practise it; and in about\r\n10 per cent., a large proportion of which are idiotic, the disease is\r\nsupposed to have arisen from this cause.\r\n\r\n“Would it be believed, if it should be said that the proportion will\r\nnot vary essentially in the other sex? On a former occasion I observed\r\nthat the absolute abandonment of the practice, even in those whose\r\nminds were unaffected by insanity, was not always easily effected.\r\nIf no _voluntary_ practice is continued, the habit may be so far\r\nestablished, and the susceptibility to the complaint be so great,\r\nthat slight irritation will produce it, and that often for a long\r\ntime after the danger is fully appreciated, and the victory over the\r\npropensity achieved so far as cautiously avoiding known and intentional\r\nindulgence. Nocturnal pollution and involuntary emissions come from\r\nslight causes and trifling irritation, but perpetuate for a long time\r\nall the train of unhappy influences that have been heretofore detailed.\r\nThe unfortunate subject of this detestable vice, whose mental energy\r\nis unimpaired, and whose moral feelings are susceptible of impression,\r\ncan be persuaded to abandon it, if the danger is set before him in its\r\ntrue light; but hundreds can bear me testimony that the effects of\r\nit are long felt, and the involuntary excitement produced by dreams,\r\nlascivious companions, warm beds, and improper intercourse with corrupt\r\nsociety, has for a long time after had its influence in retarding\r\ncomplete recovery to health. With the insane we can have no such hopes,\r\nand no such prospects of cure. They will rarely form resolutions on\r\nthe subject, and still more rarely adhere to them. Reason, the balance\r\nwheel of the mind, being denied them, they are obnoxious to the\r\ninfluence of all the propensities in a high degree.\r\n\r\n“After the practice of masturbation, as a voluntary habit, is entirely\r\nsuspended, long and persevering efforts will be required to remove\r\nthe effects from the system, and restore it to vigor and soundness.\r\nThe individual himself must exercise great self-denial, and resolve\r\nto persevere with the means and overcome all obstacles that may be\r\nin his way, however formidable and difficult. The regimen to be\r\nadopted must be strictly adhered to on all occasions. As the inebriate\r\nwould probably never conquer his appetite for alcoholic drink if he\r\nindulged once a month only--so in this habit, the occasional indulgence\r\nwill thwart the whole plan of cure. The diet should be simple and\r\nnutritious; the exercise should be moderate and gentle; indulgence\r\nin bed should not be allowed, and the individual should always sleep\r\nalone. A mattress is better than a soft bed. He should rise immediately\r\nupon waking, and never retire till the disposition to sleep comes\r\nstrongly upon him. The cold bath is a valuable remedy; a sea bath is\r\nbetter, and the shower bath often superior to either.\r\n\r\n“Narcotics, if there is a high degree of irritability in the system,\r\nare valuable remedies, of which conium, belladonna, hyoscyamus, nux\r\nvomica, and opium, may be used under different circumstances, combined\r\nor singly, according to the effects. Blisters and issues on the pudenda\r\nor perineum, promise well, and the different preparations of bark and\r\niron, and other mineral tonics, should be used till all the effects of\r\nthe habit are removed, till the propensity is fully conquered, and the\r\nconstitution is restored to health and vigor.”\r\n\r\nAmong the cases which occurred in the practice of this gentleman, are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n“A respectable young gentleman, of one of the learned professions,\r\nwas out of health for a long period; his head and eyes suffered\r\nexceedingly, and he was in a state little short of insanity. He\r\nplaced himself under the care of one of the most eminent men in the\r\nmetropolis, and followed his prescriptions a year, but without benefit.\r\nHe then called upon another, who asked him whether he was addicted to\r\nmasturbation, to which he answered in the affirmative. The advice given\r\nhim was principally to abstain from the indulgence, and his health\r\ngradually improved, and is now re-established.\r\n\r\n“B. D., aged 20, had had ill health for a year or more; he was pale,\r\nfeeble, nervous--lost his resolution--had no appetite--took to his\r\nbed most of the time, and became dull, almost speechless, and wholly\r\nabstracted and melancholy. His brother was his physician; but not\r\nascertaining the cause of his symptoms, he gained no advantage over\r\nthe disease, and the unhappy young man was constantly losing strength\r\nand flesh. After a while he came under the care of the writer. He\r\nwas in the most miserable condition conceivable; emaciated, feeble,\r\npallid--had night sweats, diarrhœa, or costiveness, total loathing\r\nof all food; his heart beat, his head was painful, and he felt no\r\ndesire, and would make no effort, to live. Suspecting masturbation, I\r\nfound, upon strict inquiry and watching, that my suspicions were well\r\nfounded. I pointed out the danger of the practice, assured him that it\r\nwas the cause of all his sufferings, and that he might be restored to\r\nusefulness and health again if he would strictly adhere to the course\r\nprescribed for him. He took bark and iron alternately for a long time,\r\npursued a course of gentle exercise and invigorating diet, and gave up\r\nat once the vicious indulgence. After a long time he wholly recovered,\r\nand is now a healthy and valuable citizen.\r\n\r\n“P. W., aged 27, called for advice in the summer of 1834, having had\r\nill health for some eighteen months or two years. He complained of\r\nconfusion of the head and pain in the eyes, indigestion, palpitation of\r\nthe heart, and difficulty of respiration. His sleep was disturbed, his\r\ntemper irritable, and he felt dissatisfied with himself, and greatly\r\ninclined to gloom and melancholy. He complained of listlessness and\r\nindisposition to any bodily efforts, and of inability to fix his mind\r\nupon any subject, or give his attention to any business. His hands\r\nwere cold, countenance pale and dejected, pulse frequent, and his\r\nwhole system in a state of great irritation. It was ascertained that\r\nfor two or three years he had been in the daily habit of masturbation.\r\nFor eight or nine months last past, he has discontinued it; he is,\r\nhowever, occasionally subject to nocturnal emission, which has thus\r\nfar interfered with his recovery; but he is better, and under the use\r\nof tonic remedies, exercise and generous diet, feels confident of\r\nrecovery, having regained his spirits and appetite.\r\n\r\n“H. F., aged 20, was for a long time in the habit of masturbation.\r\nHe was for years confined to the house, and much of the time to his\r\nbed. By long indulgence the habit had become irresistible, and the\r\nconsequences truly deplorable. His mind was as fickle and capricious\r\nas that of an infant, and his health was wholly prostrated. For five\r\nor six years he was the most wretched being imaginable. Nocturnal\r\npollutions, spontaneous emission, and all the evils resulting from\r\nunrestrained indulgence, were presented in this truly unhappy young\r\nman. He had been apprized of the danger which the continued practice\r\nwould bring upon him, and was sensible that all his trials had their\r\norigin in this vice; and yet the propensity had become so strong that\r\nhe could not resist it, and if he did, the consequences had become\r\nsuch that little benefit was derived from his good resolution. In his\r\nintercourse with his friends he was covered with shame and confusion,\r\nand seemed to feel conscious that every individual that he met with\r\nknew, as well as himself, the height and the depth of his degradation.\r\nIn this condition, in a fit of desperation, he attempted to emasculate\r\nhimself, but succeeded in removing one testicle only. After he\r\nrecovered from the dangerous wound which he inflicted, he began to get\r\nbetter, and after two years he recovered his health and spirits. He has\r\nsince, at the age of 45, _married_ a very clever woman, and they live\r\nin peace and harmony.\r\n\r\nH. ----, a young man 20 years of age, had been feeble and dejected\r\nfor two years. He was pale, torpid, irresolute, and shamefaced in the\r\nextreme--so much so, that I could not catch his eye during a sitting of\r\nan hour. He complained of his head, of short breathing and palpitation\r\nof the heart, and of extreme debility. His extremities were cold\r\nand damp, his muscular system remarkably flabby, and his snail-like\r\nmotions evinced great loss of muscular strength. His father, who\r\naccompanied the young man, said that he had consulted many physicians\r\nwithout benefit. The moment that he came into my room I was strongly\r\nimpressed that he was the victim of this solitary vice. I questioned\r\nhim sometime without ascertaining the cause of disease. His father\r\nwas wholly ignorant, and the physicians had not suspected it, or\r\ninquired concerning it. I requested a private interview--told him the\r\ndanger of such habits, the importance of ascertaining the true cause of\r\ndisease, and my suspicions that he was in this habit, and that if so,\r\nhe would soon fall a victim to its influence. He then acknowledged that\r\nhe was in the daily practice of masturbation, and had been for three\r\nyears--that he often also had spontaneous emission, &c. He had never\r\nsuspected that it had any influence upon his health.\r\n\r\n“The symptoms which follow masturbation, viz. nocturnal pollution and\r\nspontaneous emission, often continue after the victim of the vice is\r\nmade sensible of the danger of voluntary indulgence. These require\r\ndistinct and separate consideration. In some cases they become very\r\nobstinate; and in spite of every effort, continue to make such a waste\r\nof vital energies as to prevent a recovery of the health--and the\r\nnew form of disease continuing, the same fatal results follow which\r\ntake place from a continuance of the habit. The local irritability\r\nof the organs of generation often become so great, that the ordinary\r\nevacuations of the bowels and the bladder produce an emission; and\r\neven lascivious ideas, riding on horseback, or other equally slight\r\nirritation, has the same effect. Such cases require the utmost care, to\r\nafford any chance of recovery.\r\n\r\n“In addition to the common remedies prescribed for the effects of\r\nmasturbation--as bark, iron, silver, the cold bath and shower bath,\r\n&c., which are valuable remedies for this local, as well as for the\r\ngeneral debility attending the habit--other remedies, of a more\r\nstimulating character, and that have a more direct local effect upon\r\nthese organs, are also indicated. Of these, tincture of lytta, bals.\r\ncopaiva, and nitrate of silver, may be named. The strong tinct. of\r\nlytta, (made of pulv. lytta, 10 oz. alcohol, lbj.) may be taken in\r\ndoses of from 10 to 20 drops, increasing, so as to produce a slight\r\nirritation of the urethra, and continued in such doses as will keep\r\nup this effect without occasioning actual pain. The dose should be\r\nrepeated three or four times a day, generally. The very best effects\r\noften result from the use of this remedy.\r\n\r\n“Balsam of copaiva, if the urethra is irritable, may be a valuable\r\nremedy. Nitrate of silver is also both useful as a general remedy, and\r\nas having some local action on these organs. From one to four grains\r\nmay be taken daily, combined with a little opium, to prevent irritation\r\nof the stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\n“In leucorrhœa, which too frequently arises from this cause, these\r\nremedies promise much; and when prescribed in efficient doses, often\r\neffect a cure, whatever may have been the cause of the disease. It is\r\nnot too much to say, that no one cause more frequently affects the\r\nhealth of females, and lays the foundation of fatal disease, than\r\nsevere and long continued leucorrhœa; and yet, if attended to early,\r\nit is easily cured. It ought, however, even if slight, never to be\r\nneglected.”\r\n\r\nMany cases similar in character to those already stated, and confirming\r\nthe foregoing observations, have been transmitted to us by Dr. A.\r\nSidney Doane, and Prof. J. W. Francis, both of New York. Our limits,\r\nhowever, forbid their insertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The injection into the rectum of a strong decoction of pomegranate\r\nroot will destroy these ascarides.
