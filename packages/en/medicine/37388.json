While there is\r\na very extensive literature concerning tobacco, yet it is surprising how\r\nfew books there are written expressly for the smoker. Much has been\r\nwritten concerning culture, production and manufacture; the historical and\r\nanecdotal aspects have been catered for; pamphlets and books abusing and\r\ndenouncing the use of tobacco are plentiful; but the smoker will find it\r\ndifficult to get a book just giving him the facts concerning tobacco and\r\nsmoking, which he ought to know, and omitting matters, which, although\r\ninteresting, are not necessary. This little book is an attempt to fulfil\r\nthat purpose; and it is felt that no apology is needed for its appearance.\r\nIf the average user of tobacco is questioned concerning the matters\r\ntreated in the following pages, he will be found ignorant of them. This\r\nought not be so. The custom of tobacco smoking is so general and so\r\nintimate a part of the daily life of the great majority of men, that a\r\nbetter acquaintance with the plant, its qualities, uses and effects,\r\nshould be cultivated and welcomed.\r\n\r\nNo claim is made for originality. The facts here stated have been gathered\r\nfrom various sources and the only credit claimed is for putting them\r\ntogether in a concise and consecutive form. The object aimed at is to give\r\ninformation. Whether the custom of tobacco smoking is desirable, whether\r\nin any individual case it would be beneficial or otherwise to smoke--these\r\nand similar questions are left to the reader's own judgment from the facts\r\nand opinions presented, as well as from his own observations. The man who\r\nuses tobacco daily should know what he is doing. If statements are made\r\neither verbally or in print concerning the custom he should be able to\r\nverify them or show that they are incorrect. It is trusted that the\r\ninformation given in these pages will enable him to form a clear judgment\r\nwhatever the judgment may be.\r\n\r\nIt may be felt that many aspects of the use of tobacco and matters\r\nconnected with it have either not been touched on, or only referred to\r\nvery briefly. The reader who may desire further information will find it\r\nin the bibliographical references given throughout the book. These\r\nreferences have generally been consulted by the author and his\r\nindebtedness is acknowledged here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL--BOTANICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL\r\n\r\nThe history of tobacco commences with the discovery of the New World by\r\nColumbus. The Chinese claim that it was known and used by them much\r\nearlier, but there appears to be no evidence to support this claim.\r\nColumbus found the natives of Cuba smoking the dried leaves, and his\r\nfollowers are said to have brought the plant to Spain about 1512. Oviedo\r\npublished a book entitled _La Historia general de las Indias_ in Seville\r\nin 1526, in which he mentions pipe smoking. It may be inferred that this\r\ncustom was well established in Spain then. Sir Walter Raleigh is usually\r\ncredited with having brought tobacco to England for the first time from\r\nVirginia in 1586; and the Virginian Colonists are known to have cultivated\r\nthe plant at that time; but there is evidence enough to show that Sir\r\nFrancis Drake was the first to introduce the plant into England. Drake's\r\nvoyages were made between 1570 and 1580 and he brought the plant with him\r\nin one of these. Some give the date of introduction by Drake as 1560.\r\nRaleigh was, however, probably the first English distinguished smoker, and\r\nhe cultivated the plant on his estate at Youghal, Ireland. There is no\r\ndoubt about the culture of tobacco by the early English Colonists in the\r\nU. S., but it is doubtful whether the plant was introduced by them from\r\nEngland or whether they continued a culture learned from the Natives. From\r\nVirginia it spread to the other colonies. In Peru and other parts of South\r\nAmerica the growing of tobacco was well established at the time of the\r\nSpanish Conquest.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 Jean Nicot, the French Ambassador at Lisbon, sent some tobacco to\r\nCatherine de Medici as a cure for headache. Catherine was pleased with it\r\nand is said to have become quite addicted to its use. Tobacco was\r\ndesignated the \"Queen's herb\" and the \"Sovereign herb\" from this\r\ncircumstance and Nicot himself is perpetuated in the word \"Nicotine\" and\r\nits derivatives.\r\n\r\nMany persons erroneously give credit to Nicot for the introduction of\r\ntobacco into Europe. It is quite clear, however, from Oviedo's book,\r\nquoted above, that the plant was known in Spain very much earlier; and it\r\nis most probable that the immediate followers of Columbus brought samples\r\nof the leaves and pipes back to Spain with them. Moreover, in 1558,\r\nPhillip II of Spain sent Francisco Hernandez, a physician, to investigate\r\nthe resources, etc., of Mexico, and on his return he brought back tobacco\r\nas one of the products, and grew it as a drug. From Spain and England,\r\nthe use of tobacco spread by degrees all over the known world.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nPENN, W.

Other well-known members of this family are the Irish potato,\r\nthe red pepper, the tomato, the egg-plant, etc.\r\n\r\nAmerican tobacco belongs almost exclusively to that group of this family\r\nwhich comprise the genus _Nicotiana_. Of this genus there are about 50\r\nseparate species, one of which, _Nicotiana Tabacum_, supplies almost all\r\nthe tobacco of commerce. Plants of this species grow from 2 feet to 9 feet\r\nin height; they have numerous wide-spreading leaves sometimes as much as 3\r\nfeet in length; these leaves may be oval, oblong, pointed, or lanceolate\r\nin shape, and are generally of a pale green color when young; they are\r\narranged alternately in a spiral on the stem; the root is large and\r\nfibrous; the stem is erect, round and viscid, branching near the top. The\r\nalternate arrangement of the leaves on the stalk, succeeding each other\r\nspirally, so that the 9th overhangs the 1st, the 10th the 2nd, and so on,\r\nis very characteristic. The distance on the stalk between the leaves is\r\nabout 2 inches. Flowers are in large clusters, with corollas of rose\r\ncolor, or white tinged with pink. The leaves and stalks are covered with\r\nsoft downy hair. The plant is perennial but crops are usually raised from\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nOf this species (N. Tabacum) there are probably more than 100 varieties\r\ngrown in the U. S. alone. Some of the best known will be described later.\r\n\r\nTo this same species (N. Tabacum) Havana, East Indian and European\r\ntobaccos principally belong. The other important species are:\r\n\r\n_Nicotiana Persica._ Grown in Persia. This has a white flower and the\r\nleaves almost enwrap the stem. It is used almost exclusively as a\r\npipe-smoking tobacco. Some claim that this is only a variant of N.\r\nTabacum.\r\n\r\n_Nicotiana Repanda._ This is a species of Cuban tobacco entirely different\r\nfrom that grown in the Havana district. It is also called Yara.\r\n\r\n_Nicotiana Rustica._ A kind of wild growing tobacco principally cultivated\r\nin Mexico, and which is claimed as the parent of some of the Turkish,\r\nSyrian and Latakia tobaccos although many authorities claim that these\r\ntobaccos belong to the species _N. Tabacum_. The European tobacco is\r\nhardier than the American parent plant. The leaves are smaller.\r\n\r\n_N. Rustica._ Also includes common Hungarian and Turkish tobaccos. There\r\nare large and small leaved varieties.\r\n\r\n_N. Crispa._ Grown in Syria and largely in Central Asia. Used as a\r\ncigarette tobacco in the Orient.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that there are many varieties of _N. Tabacum_ in\r\nthe U. S. Of these the most important are known to botanists by the\r\nnames, _Nicotiana Tabacum Macrophylla_ and _Nicotiana Tabacum\r\nAngustifolia_.\r\n\r\nMaryland tobacco belongs to the _Macrophylla_ variety and there are many\r\nother types differing from each other according to shape of the leaf, size\r\nof the stalk, etc.\r\n\r\nVirginian tobacco is of the _Angustifolia_ variety, and of this also there\r\nare many different types.\r\n\r\nMost European and other grown tobaccos have been raised from original\r\nplants of the Maryland and Virginian varieties.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that there is no essential difference in cigar,\r\npipe smoking or cigarette tobaccos. The differences are physical only. All\r\nkinds may be obtained from the same species or even the same variety of\r\nthe species by suitable culture and crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nANASTASIA, G.

TREATMENT OF THE GROWING PLANT. SHADE\r\nGROWN TOBACCO. HARVESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULTIVATION OF THE TOBACCO PLANT\r\n\r\nA few general facts concerning the culture of the tobacco plant and its\r\ntreatment until it reaches the hands of the manufacturers will be of\r\ninterest for the smoker.\r\n\r\nThe general principles underlying the culture of tobacco are the same\r\nwhether it is intended for the cigar, pipe smoking or cigarette trade; but\r\nthe treatment of the leaf after it is harvested differs considerably.\r\n\r\nTobacco is a perennial plant. It is, however, usually raised each year\r\nfrom seed. The seedlings are usually ready for planting towards the end of\r\nMay and are generally planted between the last week in May and the middle\r\nof June.\r\n\r\nThe successful raising of tobacco depends on four principal factors: (1)\r\nthe climate, (2) the nature of the soil, (3) the seed, and (4) on the\r\nmethod of culture.\r\n\r\nThe _climate_ must be such as to favor rapid growth and therefore must\r\nfurnish sufficient heat and moisture during the time the plant is growing.\r\nThe fineness of the texture and the elasticity of the leaf depend on the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nOn the _soil_ the plant depends for its food, and for the absorption of\r\nthose chemical constituents on which depend the burning qualities, the\r\nstrength and the color.\r\n\r\nThe physical qualities of the plant, structure and form, thickness of\r\nveins, size, shape and distribution of leaves, are derived from the\r\n_seed_.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the _method of cultivation_ (including the curing process)\r\ndepends in part the final color, flavor and aroma; the type and trade\r\nvalue; that is to say, on successful culture and harvesting and treatment\r\nat the right time and in the best way, must depend the grower's hopes of\r\nthe final value of his crop. The quantity of nicotine, essential oils,\r\netc., on which flavor and strength depend, is regulated to the greatest\r\nextent by the time of cutting.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil is a very important matter in the culture of\r\ntobacco, for the color of the cured tobacco leaf depends almost entirely\r\non the soil. The light colored leaf is grown on light colored soil and the\r\ndarker leaf is grown on heavy, dark soil. The best type of soil for the\r\nraising of tobacco intended for the cigar trade is a warm, deep, sandy\r\nloam which rests on permeable well-drained subsoil. The very light colored\r\nyellow tobacco cannot be raised except on light colored, porous soils; and\r\nso susceptible is this matter of the coloring of the leaf that it has been\r\nnoted that the darkening of the soil by a liberal allowance of stable\r\nmanure will, on a very light colored soil, change the color of the\r\ntobacco leaf from a bright yellow to a mahogany shade. Very light sandy\r\nsoils or very light loams with clayey subsoils are usually chosen for\r\nthese light yellow tobaccos. Although by processes subsequent to growth it\r\nis possible to darken the color of tobacco leaf, there is no known process\r\nthat will make a dark leaf light in color.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the soil must be very fertile and rich in the special substances\r\nneeded by the growing plant. This is all the more necessary because\r\ntobacco is a rapidly growing plant, and reaches its maturity within a few\r\nmonths after its planting. The rapidity of growth therefore demands a rich\r\nfertile soil well stored with plant food. Good manuring, or liberal\r\ntreatment with fertilizers, is essential for keeping such soils in prime\r\ncondition, because the period of growing must not be extended.\r\n\r\nTobacco is usually planted in rows, the rows being from three to four feet\r\napart, the usual arrangement being that the plants are generally about 12\r\nor 18 inches apart in the row. Some planters, however, give the plants\r\nmore room for many reasons, varying the distance between the plants even\r\nas much as 30 inches. Cigar leaf tobacco plants are usually placed about\r\n14 inches apart.\r\n\r\nThere are various operations necessary during the growth of the plant. The\r\nmost important of these for our purpose are those known as \"priming\" or\r\n\"thinning out\" and \"cutting.\" Priming is usually done when the plant is\r\nwell advanced in growth, but the time varies with different growers and\r\naccording to the species. It consists in removing the lower or imperfect\r\nleaves from the plant, or these which have in any way become injured from\r\ninsect or other harmful agencies. As a general rule the larger the number\r\nof leaves there is on a plant the lower is the quality of the subsequently\r\ncured leaf. An average of about 10 leaves to each plant is what is favored\r\nby most growers, and the plants are usually thinned to this extent. Seed\r\nbuds are removed also at the same time and for the same reason. If the\r\nplants are \"thinned\" late and when they are approaching full growth the\r\nleaves removed are not destroyed, but are cured separately and sold as\r\ninferior quality and are usually called \"primings\" or \"planters lugs.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Southern American States the time allowed for the growth and\r\nmaturing of the plant is somewhat longer than in the eastern and more\r\nnortherly states where the soil, owing to richer fertilization, favors the\r\nrapid growth. Moreover, a stronger quality of tobacco is wanted and the\r\nextra time allows the plant to effect a greater elaboration in its cells\r\nof the oils and gums, etc., which contribute particularly to strength and\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADE GROWN TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe matter of rapid growth has, however, its limitations. Too much\r\nsunlight is considered a disadvantage. Under such powerful action,\r\nnutrition is drawn quickly from the soil and the plants ripen too quickly.\r\nUnder such circumstances the leaves tend to become heavy bodied and not\r\nvery large in size. To defeat this tendency and produce large, thin silky\r\nleaves for the cigar trade, the grower sometimes covers his field with a\r\ntent of cheese-cloth or similar protection from the glare of the sun. The\r\nripening process is thereby slowed and the leaves are thinner, larger and\r\nlighter in shade. This method is employed principally in Cuba, Florida and\r\nConnecticut where cigar wrapper leaves are produced, and such tobacco is\r\nknown as shade-grown.\r\n\r\nTobacco which has been planted out at the end of May or early in June is\r\nusually ready for harvesting at the end of August or beginning to middle\r\nof September. The actual time of harvesting varies a good deal according\r\nto the variety grown and the physical condition concerned in the growing\r\nof the plant. The heavier tobaccos which are intended for the export trade\r\nare usually harvested late. The most important operations connected with\r\nthe culture of the tobacco leaf are the \"yellowing\" and \"curing\"\r\nprocesses, and, as these commence with the cutting of the plant, this\r\nlatter must be done under strictly favorable conditions in order to insure\r\nproper results. The cutting must not be done while the sun is very hot, or\r\nwhile there is rain, or before the plant is fully matured. On the other\r\nhand, after the plant has reached its maturity, it must not be allowed to\r\ncontinue its growth, which along with other things would be likely to\r\nincrease its nicotine content which is not desirable. The experienced\r\ntobacco grower knows well from the appearance of the plant when it is best\r\nfitted for cutting. The leaves become thick and heavy and assume a\r\ndrooping appearance. They become crisp with a tendency to break easily,\r\nand a mottled, spotty look is noticeable on them. The surface becomes\r\ngummy and oily; the oily substances increases and exudates as the days\r\npass. When these signs appear the tobacco is cut on the first day when the\r\nweather favors. It is usual in most cases to split the stalks down the\r\nmiddle and allow the leaves to wilt, before the stalk is entirely cut\r\nthrough. After sufficient wilting the leaves are gathered in piles and\r\nexposed to the action of the sunlight; or they are stuck by the stalks on\r\npoles or framework and so exposed that the sun and air have free access to\r\nall parts. This is the best and most approved practice. \"Yellowing\" of the\r\nleaf is very rapid after the plant is cut; it is the natural effect due to\r\ncutting off the food supply of the leaf and the consequent slow death of\r\nthe vitality of the cells. It must be remembered that the leaves are\r\nlarge, varying in size (according to species) from 12 inches to over 2\r\nfeet in length. Such a leaf needs a large quantity of food and the sudden\r\ncutting off of the supply effects a rapid change in appearance. The leaves\r\nare allowed to hang on the scaffolds 3 to 5 days until they are fully\r\nyellowed. They are then ready for the process of \"curing,\" which is the\r\nmost important operation connected with cultivation. The \"curing\" and\r\n\"fermentation\" which the leaf undergoes are chemical actions and their\r\nsuccess depends on the proper method of \"yellowing.\" The leaves must not\r\nbe exposed to the sun too long, because the cells would lose their\r\nvitality too rapidly and be unfitted for the new part they have to play in\r\nthe curing process. The chemical changes will be explained in subsequent\r\nchapters. It is desired that the reader should understand that to ensure\r\na successful final issue the planter has need to watch continuously and to\r\nknow all the conditions. If the leaf does not \"yellow\" properly no amount\r\nof after care in curing will make up for this deficiency. In tobacco\r\ngrowing as in everything else, to ensure final high quality each step in\r\nthe process must be executed with skill, care, and judgment.\r\n\r\nThe yield of tobacco per acre varies from about 300 lbs. of leaf in the\r\nsouthern states to 1,000 lbs. or more in the eastern. 700 to 800 lbs. per\r\nacre is considered a good average crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nKILLEBREW AND MYRICK. _Tobacco leaf; its culture and cure, marketing and\r\nmanufacturing._ Part I.

PRODUCTION IN THE\r\nNEW WORLD OTHER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S PRODUCTION OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe world's recorded annual crop of tobacco leaf is over one million tons.\r\nThe latest government figures available are those for 1912 and 1913, and\r\nshow 2,696,401,379 and 2,722,190,030 lbs. respectively. Of this amount\r\nAsia and America produce each about 350,000 tons, Europe about 250,000\r\ntons and the rest of the world the balance.\r\n\r\nThe details of the production in the U. S. will be given in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe principal Asiatic countries which produce tobacco are China, Japan,\r\nAfghanistan, India, Persia and Asia Minor. China has an immense production\r\nand consumption of tobacco, a large portion of which finds its way into\r\nwestern markets for the cigar and cigarette trade and is sold as \"Turkish\"\r\ntobacco. No figures as to production are available.\r\n\r\nBritish India and Afghanistan produce good tobacco, a lot of which is used\r\nin Hindustan and other Eastern countries.\r\n\r\nThe Persian crop is known to be large, but there are no available records\r\nof it. In Persia most of the tobacco raised is of the species known as\r\nNicotiana Persica. This is generally known under its trade name of Tumbach\r\nor _Tumbeki_ (or more correctly Teymbeki). This is the common Eastern\r\nname for tobacco. It is considerably exported to the countries in the\r\nneighborhood of Persia and is smoked in the pipe known as the Narghilli.\r\nIn this pipe the teymbeki burns in contact with a piece of incandescent\r\ncharcoal. The smoker draws the vapor through a flexible tube which passes\r\nto the bottom of a water chamber and passes above it, whence it is\r\ninhaled. The narghili is technically a water pipe. The teymbeki is very\r\nstrong in nicotine, containing up to 5 or 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nJapan produces large and medium size leaf of good color but poor in\r\nquality. It is generally used for pipe and cigarette trade.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of production for Asia are extremely unreliable. When we\r\nconsider the teeming populations of China, India and other Eastern\r\ncountries and the prevalence of the smoking habit, it is very probable\r\nthat the figure of production (350,000 tons annually) is much under the\r\nmark. There is very little export of tobacco from the United States or\r\nEurope to the East. Whatever tobacco is consumed there is mostly of its\r\nown production.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN PRODUCTION OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nIn Europe the principal tobacco producing countries are Germany, France,\r\nAustria, Russia, Italy and Turkey.\r\n\r\nGermany has nearly 40,000 acres under tobacco cultivation in Rhenish\r\nBavaria, Baden, Hesse, and Alsace-Lorraine. The annual production is about\r\n50 to 70 million lbs.; and in addition nearly 3 times that much is\r\nimported. German home grown leaf is medium to large in size, of fair body,\r\nheavy and with coarse veins. It is used for cigar filler and pipe, but is\r\nnot suited for cigar wrappers. (See the chapter on cigars.)\r\n\r\nFrench tobacco is raised from Virginia seed. It is dark, coarse and heavy\r\nand is suitable for plug and snuff making only.\r\n\r\nRussia is the largest European producer. Russian tobacco leaf is very\r\nlarge in size and like the French is coarse, dark and heavy and is only\r\nfit for plug and snuff making. There is a lighter kind grown from Turkish\r\nseed in South Russia which is fit for cigarettes.\r\n\r\nItaly has made several attempts to cultivate good tobacco, and several\r\ndifferent types are produced. A dark heavy leaf is grown from Virginia\r\nseed, and a type from Kentucky seed is also produced. These types are\r\nsuitable to the dark, heavy fertile soils of Middle and North Italy. In\r\nthe lighter sandy soil of the south, the varieties grown are raised from\r\nTurkish seed and are similar in appearance and quality to the genuine\r\nTurkish tobacco.\r\n\r\nHungary is a heavy grower of tobacco and produces some of the best in\r\nEurope. There is a heavy dark type, of a rich brown color, medium sized\r\nleaf with small and thin veins, which is used in cigar manufacture. A\r\nsmall bright yellow leaf is also grown, poor in quality and aroma, which\r\nis used for pipe smoking and cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe most important foreign tobacco as regards U. S. consumers is that\r\nknown as Turkish. The leaves of the Turkish tobacco are small (about 8\"\r\nlong), clear yellow in color, and have a special aroma, which renders them\r\npeculiarly suitable for the manufacturing of cigarettes. The principal\r\nproducing centers are Macedonia, Albania, Syria, Palestine and Trebizond,\r\nthat raised in Macedonia being per-haps the most celebrated. Just like the\r\nCuban leaf, the very best grades of Turkish tobacco are not exported, but\r\nare kept for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\n_Latakia_ tobacco is produced in the northern part of Syria. This tobacco\r\nhas a very small nicotine content. It is produced by a special fabrication\r\nand is in very great demand as an ingredient of pipe smoking mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe District of Cavalla in the Province of Roumelia, is one of the most\r\nimportant tobacco centers in the Turkish Empire. There are about 75,000\r\nacres under tobacco cultivation and the annual production is about\r\n10,000,000 lbs. The American Tobacco Co. has a large establishment here\r\nthrough which it purchases its Turkish leaf, amounting to over 6 million\r\nlbs. yearly, for the manufacture of Turkish cigarettes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe total importation of Turkish leaf into the United States during 1913\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n  From Turkey in Europe      10,816,048 lbs.\r\n  From Turkey in Asia        18,955,295 lbs.\r\n\r\nGreece and the Balkan States produce tobacco which partakes of the\r\nqualities of Hungarian and Turkish, the Grecian leaf being used a good\r\ndeal as a substitute for genuine Turkish tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO PRODUCED IN THE NEW WORLD OTHER THAN IN UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe government of Canada has given a lot of attention to experiments in\r\nconnection with the growth of tobacco in the Dominion, but only with\r\nindifferent success. The leaf is raised principally from Virginian seed,\r\nbut is large and coarse and is only fit for inferior plug and snuff\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nCuban Tobacco. The tobacco raised in the Island of Cuba is the most\r\ncelebrated in the world for cigar making. The leaf is of a rich, brown\r\ncolor; narrow and small in size, varying from 8 to 18 inches in length.\r\nIts richness of flavor and the peculiar aroma are its chief\r\ncharacteristics. Cuba produces annually about 300,000 to 500,000 bales of\r\ntobacco varying in weight from 80 to 150 lbs. per bale, nearly one-half of\r\nwhich is exported to the United States alone.\r\n\r\nThe importation of Cuban leaf into the United States over a series of\r\nyears is shown below:\r\n\r\n_Cuban leaf imports into the U. S.

In this is the District of _Vuelto Abajo_ which is celebrated\r\nthe world over for the very finest cigar tobacco. The District of Habana\r\nor Havana produces about 13 per cent and Santa Clara about 13 per cent.\r\nThe Cubans themselves favor the dark \"Maduro\" fully ripened leaves. At\r\npresent a good deal of Cuban cigar leaf is grown under shade with the\r\nresult that although when fully mature they are light in color, they are\r\nrich in flavor.\r\n\r\nThe value of the cigar leaf imported by the U. S. from Cuba averages at\r\npresent about 14 or 15 million dollars annually.\r\n\r\nPorto Rican leaf possesses many of the qualities of good Havana leaf, and\r\nlike the latter is used in cigar manufacture. The annual production is\r\nabout 120,000 bales. The U. S. imports from 4 to 5 million lbs. annually.\r\nFurther particulars regarding Cuban and Porto Rican leaf will be given in\r\nthe chapters concerning cigars.\r\n\r\nMexico produces a tobacco, large as to leaf, dark in color, with heavy\r\nbody and coarse veins. The tobacco is very strong in flavor. The best\r\ngrades approach the Cuban tobacco in quality and are imported and used as\r\nsubstitutes for it. The U. S. importation is small. The annual production\r\nis about 34 million lbs. The best quality is produced in the neighborhood\r\nof Vera Cruz, and only a small portion is exported, principally to Cuba.\r\n\r\nBrazilian tobacco leaf is brown in color, medium in size, and medium in\r\nbody. It possesses fair qualities as a cigar tobacco, for which purpose it\r\nis generally used in South America, which is its principal market.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST INDIAN AND PHILIPPINE TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe Dutch East Indies (Sumatra and the adjacent islands) produce yearly\r\nabout 180 million lbs. of tobacco, all of which is used in the cigar\r\nbusiness. Of this the United States takes about from 30,000 to 40,000\r\nbales of Sumatran leaf, about 5-1/2 million lbs. About 2 lbs. of this leaf\r\nwraps 1,000 cigars.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands produce from 50 to 100 million lbs., of tobacco\r\nannually. The crop for 1913 was 101,544,736 lbs. The imports into the\r\nUnited States are principally as manufactured cigars by special\r\narrangements which will be referred to later on in the chapter on cigars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF TOBACCO IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nTOTAL PRODUCTION. AMOUNT PRODUCED BY THE DIFFERENT STATES. VARIETIES\r\nRAISED. DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF TOBACCO LEAF IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe amount of tobacco leaf raised annually in the United States varies\r\nfrom 700 million lbs. to 1,000 million lbs. Thus, according to the\r\nGovernment Statistical Reports, the production in 1909 was 1,055,764,806\r\nlbs., being an unusually high figure. The production in 1913 was\r\n953,734,000 lbs. and in 1914, 1,034,679,000 lbs. The average crop may be\r\ntaken as about 800 million lbs., about half of which is exported as leaf,\r\nand the other half manufactured in the U. S. into cigars, smoking and\r\nchewing tobaccos, etc., and consumed in the U. S. To produce this immense\r\ncrop over one million acres of rich, fertile land is under culture, the\r\nactual government figures for 1913 being 1,216,000 acres, and for 1914,\r\n1,224,000, and the value of the raw crop is from 80 to 100 million\r\ndollars, which works out to an average value of from 10 to 12 cents per\r\nlb. The cost of producing the best grades of cigar leaf in the Eastern\r\nStates is from 8 to 10 cents per lb.; in Wisconsin from 5 to 10 cents. The\r\nprice paid to the growers is from 5 to 15 cents, except for the highest\r\ngrades (cigar wrapper leaf) for which special prices, up to 40 or 50\r\ncents, may be paid. Smoking and chewing leaf of average grade fetches from\r\n6 to 7 cents per lb.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it will be seen that the agricultural industry of\r\ntobacco growing is a most important one, and it is constantly increasing\r\nboth in the quantity produced and in value. About 45 of the states in the\r\nUnion are engaged in tobacco culture, the principal states and the\r\nquantities produced being as follows (for 1914):\r\n\r\n  Kentucky              364 million lbs.\r\n  North Carolina        172    \"     \"\r\n  Virginia              114    \"     \"\r\n  Tennessee              63    \"     \"\r\n  Ohio                   78    \"     \"\r\n  Wisconsin              54    \"     \"\r\n  Pennsylvania           48    \"     \"\r\n  Connecticut            35    \"     \"\r\n  South Carolina         36    \"     \"\r\n  Maryland               17    \"     \"\r\n  Indiana                12    \"     \"\r\n  Massachusetts          11    \"     \"\r\n  Other states           30    \"     \"\r\n                       ----\r\n  Total                1034    \"     \"\r\n\r\nVirginia was, until recently, the premier tobacco state. Tobacco was first\r\nraised in Virginia about 1619 when the quantity produced was about 20,000\r\nlbs. By 1753 the records show that over 50 million lbs. were raised\r\nannually, all of which was exported. At this time and until about the\r\nperiod of the Civil War, Europe was dependant more than now on America for\r\nher tobacco supply, as at present a considerable part of her needs is\r\nsupplied by her own production. Tobacco was not grown in Kentucky till\r\nabout 1785 and a little later in Tennessee and Ohio. The cigar leaf\r\nindustry of the New England States did not come into activity till about\r\n1830. Cigar leaf was raised in Florida about the same time but was\r\ndiscontinued and was not resumed till fifty years later.\r\n\r\nVirginia, Maryland and Tennessee have shown a declining annual production\r\nsince the Civil War. Thus Virginia in 1860 produced nearly 30 per cent of\r\nthe total U. S. crop, whereas at present it produces about 12 per cent\r\nonly. The causes which have contributed to the decline in tobacco culture\r\nin the Southern States are the loss of slave labor as well as the loss of\r\ncapital during the war; more particularly it is due to the impoverishing\r\nof the soil without adequate fertilization. Thus with superior\r\nfertilization and intensive methods, Massachusetts and Connecticut give\r\n1,750 lbs. to the acre, as against 870 and 580 lbs. for Kentucky and\r\nTennessee. In Massachusetts and Connecticut the cost for fertilizer _per\r\nfarm_ is $227 as against $17 and $4 respectively in Tennessee and\r\nKentucky. Moreover, the Northern farms are smaller than the Southern.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF TOBACCO RAISED\r\n\r\nThe varieties of tobacco raised are mainly of the native American species;\r\nbut in some states (in Florida particularly) plants are raised from\r\nimported Cuban and Sumatran seed, in an endeavor to produce cigar leaf\r\nequal in quality to the leaf now imported from these places which commands\r\na high price in the trade. The raising of cigar leaf tobacco from foreign\r\nseed began in Florida about 1902; and, although on the whole, the\r\ncultivation has been very successful, yet it cannot be said that the hoped\r\nfor results have been fully realized. It was claimed for the Florida grown\r\nSumatran leaf that in many ways it surpassed the native Sumatran leaf.\r\nCertainly the experimental samples of this Florida leaf exhibited by the\r\nU. S. at the Paris Exposition of 1900 were judged to be superior both in\r\nappearance and style and other matters. However, this superiority does not\r\nappear to have been upheld, for in the trade the native grown Sumatran\r\nleaf still holds its rank.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in the case of Florida grown Cuban leaf which at the same\r\nExposition was voted as equal to the native. The native leaf, however,\r\nwhether due to the soil or not, has a finer flavor and aroma, and the best\r\ngrades of native grown Cuban tobacco still hold the palm as the premier\r\ncigar tobacco of the world.\r\n\r\nThe leaf raised in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida,\r\nMassachusetts, and New York State, is generally used for the cigar trade\r\n(see the chapters on cigars). Ohio and Florida (Cuban seed) leaf mostly\r\nused as cigar fillers; Connecticut and Florida (Sumatran seed),\r\nPennsylvania and New York leaf mostly as wrapper leaf, the inferior leaves\r\nbeing used as fillers. Wisconsin leaf is used principally as cigar binder\r\nleaf. The total amount of cigar tobacco raised is roughly about one-fifth\r\nof the entire tobacco crop.\r\n\r\nThe southern states produce the bulk of the export dark, heavy leaf. West\r\nKentucky and Tennessee particularly, as well as Virginia, the Carolinas\r\nand Maryland, export considerable quantities. This tobacco is fire-cured.\r\nFor the domestic trade, however, (pipe-smoking, chewing and cigarettes)\r\nthe tobacco grown in these states is flue-cured, the principal product\r\nbeing of a bright yellow color, characteristic of this region.\r\n\r\nThis \"yellow tobacco belt\" extends from the coast across to the North\r\nCarolina Mountains, through Tennessee and South Carolina, Southern\r\nVirginia, Southern Ohio, a few parts of Kentucky, some of Eastern Missouri\r\nand Arkansas. The best soils are those which are of a light sandy or sandy\r\nclay nature and they need not be deep or rich. In this region the very\r\nfinest pipe-smoking tobaccos are raised. Whilst the U. S. has not been\r\nable to produce a cigar wrapper tobacco equal in quality to the Cuban or\r\nSumatran, in pipe-smoking and cigarette tobaccos she stands without a\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nThere are about 100 different varieties of tobacco grown in the U. S.,\r\nmany of these being approximately the same and are synonymous.\r\nSubvarieties are easily obtained by crossing. Cross-fertilization easily\r\ntakes place where different strains are produced in the same locality. On\r\nthis account when it is desired to keep a variety pure, care must be\r\nexerted to see that seed is collected from pure strains. On the other\r\nhand, the ease of producing new varieties gives opportunity to the various\r\nState Agricultural Experimental Stations to try out new strains for\r\ndesirable qualities. The enumeration of the differences between the\r\nvarious varieties would be tiresome for the reader, yet it will be well\r\nfor the user of tobacco to know some of these varieties, their\r\ncharacteristics and other particulars concerning them. These are given\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADING VARIETIES OF AMERICAN TOBACCOS\r\n\r\nBURLEY. The variety known as _White Burley_ has a long broad leaf, whitish\r\nin appearance when growing. The points of the leaf hang down towards the\r\nground when growing, often even touching the ground. The leaf is thin in\r\ntexture, has a mild flavor, low nicotine content and good absorbing\r\nqualities. It is one of the most popular tobaccos in the U. S. and is used\r\nfor pipe-smoking and chewing tobaccos and cigarettes. It cures to a bright\r\nyellow brown color.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety known as _Red Burley_ which has a thin leaf narrowing\r\nfrom center to top. The leaves are of a characteristic cinnamon color and\r\nare more elastic than those of _White Burley_. Burley tobacco is raised\r\nprincipally in Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Missouri and Indiana.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT SEEDLEAF. Large, strong leaves, thin and elastic, silky in\r\ntexture, small fibers, sweetish taste and light in color.\r\n\r\nUsed in the cigar trade as fillers and wrappers and grown in New England,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and to a smaller extent in Wisconsin, Minnesota,\r\nIndiana, Illinois and Florida.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT BROADLEAF. A modification of the above, the leaves being\r\nbroader in proportion to their length. They are up to 35 inches long and\r\n22 inches wide. Largely used in the cigar trade as filler and wrappers.\r\nBoth the Connecticut Seedleaf and Broadleaf are superior to the imported\r\nSumatran leaf in flavor and aroma, but are inferior in elasticity and\r\ncovering qualities.\r\n\r\nGrown principally in Connecticut and New York States.\r\n\r\nORINOCO. There are 3 varieties of this name: (1) _Short Orinoco._ Broad\r\nleaf, upright growth and open habit, light colored, much ruffled. Grown in\r\nVirginia and Missouri. (2) _Big Orinoco._ Short, broad leaf. Grown in\r\nVirginia, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. (3)\r\n_Yellow Orinoco._ Long, narrow, tapering leaf with fine texture. The\r\nsweetest variety grown. Grown in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, West Virginia and Missouri.\r\n\r\nOrinoco tobacco leaf is used largely for plug and smoking tobaccos and for\r\nthe export trade.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIAN. Sun and air-cured tobacco. Leaf is medium in size. Very bright\r\nbrown color. Is rich in gums and oils which makes it sweet and fragrant\r\nand gives it a pleasant taste. Hence it is a favorite chewing tobacco.\r\n\r\nPRYOR. There are several varieties under this name: (1) _Medley_ or _White\r\nPryor_ has a very broad leaf with silky texture and tough fiber. (2) _Blue\r\nPryor._ Large, long fine leaf and good color. (3) _Silky Pryor._ A long\r\nsharp-pointed leaf; grows thin on the stalk; very tough and pliant. (4)\r\n_Yellow Pryor._ Heavy, wide leaf, fine bright color, tough and weighs\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nPryor is used principally for the export trade and to some extent also in\r\nthe home trade both for cigar and plug and smoking tobaccos. It is grown\r\ngenerally throughout Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nMissouri and Indiana, the White variety being extensively grown in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DUTCH. A very favorite pipe-smoking tobacco. It has a small\r\nnicotine content (less than 1%). The leaf is small; narrow, thick and\r\nshort; dark brown in color, glossy surface and sweet in taste. It is grown\r\nextensively in the Miami Valley of Ohio.\r\n\r\nSUMATRA SEED. Grown principally in Florida from imported Sumatran seed.\r\nThe leaf is light in weight and color, not long compared with other\r\nseedleaf varieties. Very narrow and with fine ribs. Used in cigar trade\r\nand grown extensively also in the New England states.\r\n\r\nCUBAN SEED. This has the usual qualities of Cuban tobacco but with\r\ninferior fragrance and aroma to the native grown. Principally raised in\r\nPennsylvania, New York, Wisconsin, Connecticut and Florida for the cigar\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nPERIQUE. A special variety of tobacco grown only in a small area of\r\nLouisiana. The leaf is medium in size, has a fine fiber with small stems.\r\nTough, gummy and glossy. It is grown in a deep, rich soil and grows very\r\nrapidly. Its special characteristics are acquired in the curing, which is\r\na special process peculiar to itself, and which will be described in the\r\nchapter on Manufactured Tobaccos.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n_Yearbooks of the United States Department of Agriculture._ 1914 and\r\nprevious.\r\n\r\nHOAGLAND, I.

NICOTINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE TOBACCO PLANT\r\n\r\nThe tobacco plant when subjected to chemical analysis is found to contain\r\nall or most of the following substances:\r\n\r\n    _Mineral Bases._ Potash, Lime, Magnesia, Oxides of Iron and Manganese,\r\n    Ammonia, Silica.\r\n\r\n    _Mineral Acids._ Nitric, Hydrochloric, Sulphuric and Phosphoric.\r\n\r\n    _Organic Base._ Nicotine.\r\n\r\n    _Organic Acids._ Malic, Citric, Acetic, Oxalic, Pectic and Ulmic.\r\n\r\n    _Other Organic Substances._ Nicotianin, Green and Yellow Resin, Wax\r\n    and Fat, Nitrogenous Substances and Cellulose.\r\n\r\nThe substances which differentiate tobacco from other plants and form its\r\nchief characteristics are Nicotianin, Nicotine and Malic Acid.\r\n\r\nThe percentage in which the important substances exist in tobacco is given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  Nicotine                    From  1 to  9%\r\n  Malic and Citric Acids      From 10 to 14%\r\n  Oxalic Acid                 From  1 to  2%\r\n  Resins, Oils and Fats       From  4 to  6%\r\n  Pectic Acid                 About       5%\r\n  Cellulose                   From  7 to  8%\r\n  Albumenoids                 About      25%\r\n  Ash                         From 12 to 30%\r\n\r\nWhen tobacco is burned, chemical changes occur; the organic and other\r\ncompounds are decomposed. The volatile matters pass off in the smoke if\r\nthe combustion is complete, and the mineral ash remains. In ordinary pipe\r\nor other tobacco smoking, however, the combustion is not complete and many\r\ndecomposition products remain with the mineral ash.\r\n\r\nIn tobacco smoke the following can usually be found: Furfurol, Marsh Gas,\r\nHydrogen Sulphide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Organic Acids, Phenols, Empyreumatic\r\nOils, Pyridine, Picoline Series and possibly some Nicotine.\r\n\r\nThe ash left after complete combustion is important, as much of the\r\nsmoking qualities of the tobacco depends on its constituents. An average\r\nsample gives the following analysis (in 100 parts):\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE MINERAL CONTENTS OF TOBACCO ASH\r\n\r\n  Potash               About 27%\r\n  Soda                 About  3%\r\n  Lime                 About 40%\r\n  Magnesia             About  9%\r\n  Sodium Chloride      About  9%\r\n  Sulphuric Acid       About  3%\r\n  Silica               About  5%\r\n  Lime Phosphate       About  4%\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON SOME OF THE SUBSTANCES FOUND IN TOBACCO\r\n\r\n_Nicotine_\r\n\r\nOf all the substances found in tobacco, nicotine is the most important.\r\n\r\nNicotine in the pure state is a colorless liquid having a specific gravity\r\nof 1.027. It is an organic base having the chemical formula\r\nC{10}H{14}N{2}. It is extremely acid and burning to the taste, and is a\r\nvirulent poison. It easily volatilizes; is inflammable, and is soluble in\r\nwater, alcohol, ether and some fixed oils. Nicotine has the characteristic\r\npeculiar odor of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe amount of nicotine in tobacco is said to depend on the nature of the\r\nsoil in which it is grown; rich, heavy soils and strong nitrogenous\r\nmanuring favor the production of a large nicotine content; and light,\r\nsandy soils the opposite.\r\n\r\nMoreover the nicotine content depends on the age and development of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAn investigation by Chuard and Mellet showed nicotine contents of leaves:\r\n\r\n  In young plants 7 weeks old contained      .0324%\r\n  In plants 10 weeks old contained           .0447%\r\n  In plants 13 weeks old contained           .4989%\r\n  In plants 19 weeks old contained           .9202%\r\n\r\nThe longer the plant is permitted to grow the larger will be its nicotine\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nSchloessing has made a similar investigation and found that in the same\r\nplant the nicotine content varies from 0.79% when young to 4.32% when\r\nfully matured. Most nicotine is found in the ribs and veins.\r\n\r\nH. B. Cox (_American Druggist_ V. 24, 1894, p. 95) investigated the\r\nnicotine contents of various manufactured tobaccos. These were not\r\n\"proprietary tobaccos\" but samples obtained from different sources at\r\nrandom. His results are given here:\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOTINE CONTENTS OF DIFFERENT TOBACCOS\r\n\r\n                                  _Nicotine_\r\n\r\n  Syrian Tobacco leaf (a)              .612%\r\n  American Chewing Leaf                .935%\r\n  Syrian Tobacco Leaf (b)             1.093%\r\n  Chinese Tobacco Leaf                1.902%\r\n  Turkish Coarse Cut                  2.500%\r\n  Golden Virginia (whole strips)      2.501%\r\n  Gold Flake Virginia                 2.501%\r\n  Navy Cut (light)                    2.530%\r\n  Light Kentuckian                    2.733%\r\n  Navy Cut (dark)                     3.64 %\r\n  Best \"Bird's Eye\"                   3.931%\r\n  Cut Cavendish (a)                   4.212%\r\n  Best Shag (a)                       4.907%\r\n  Cut Cavandish (b)                   4.970%\r\n  Best Shag (b)                       5.00 %\r\n  Algerian Tobacco (a)                8.813%\r\n  French Grown Tobacco                8.711%\r\n  Algerian Tobacco (b)                8.90 %\r\n\r\nThe average of a number of samples of Syrian tobacco showed 1 to 2%\r\nnicotine, Manila and Havana 1 to 3%, Virginia and Kentucky from 2 to 7%,\r\nand French tobaccos about 9%.\r\n\r\nMost of the nicotine in tobacco becomes volatilized and decomposed during\r\ncombustion; a small part, however, may form a solution with the water\r\nwhich is also one of the combustion products. One of the decomposition\r\nproducts of nicotine is\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pyridine_\r\n\r\nPyridine is usually found in tobacco smoke. When condensed it is a\r\ncolorless non-oily liquid and is considerably less toxic than nicotine.\r\n\r\nReference will be made later on to the effects of nicotine and pyridine on\r\nthe human system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potash_\r\n\r\nPotash is important as on its amount depends the burning qualities of the\r\ntobacco. It is sometimes present in the ash to the extent of 30%, being\r\nconverted into potassium carbonate by burning. Not only for free burning\r\nis the potash valuable, but also for the better volatilization of the\r\nnicotine and other substances. The more perfect the combustion, the fewer\r\ndeleterious compounds are formed.\r\n\r\nChlorides, if present, retard the burning of the tobacco, and hence a\r\ntobacco which contains a high percentage of chloride, even if it is rich\r\nin potash salts, is a poor burning tobacco and therefore faulty. While it\r\nis important that the burning should be free and the volatilization as\r\nperfect as possible, yet the smoker does not want his tobacco to burn too\r\nrapidly. To meet this some manufacturers prepare \"slow burning\" tobaccos\r\ngenerally by the addition of some chemical which checks the potash.\r\n\r\nThe aroma and flavor of the tobacco depend to a great extent on the waxes,\r\nresins and oils, as well as on certain of the organic acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nU.

METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURING OF TOBACCO LEAF\r\n\r\nThe \"curing\" of tobacco leaf is the process of drying out which has for\r\nits object the following specific actions:\r\n\r\n    (1) The expelling of the sap and superfluous moisture.\r\n\r\n    (2) The completion of the \"yellowing\" process and the fixing of the\r\n    desired color.\r\n\r\n    (3) The preservation of the juices, etc., which give the\r\n    characteristic flavor and aroma.\r\n\r\n    (4) To give the necessary toughness and suppleness to the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the curing is done by the grower in curing sheds on the\r\nfarm immediately after the cutting of the crop; the final part, or the\r\nfermentation part is usually done by the leaf dealer or manufacturer in\r\nspecial buildings called leaf-houses.\r\n\r\nThere are three methods of curing in use by the growers, i. e., sun\r\ncuring, air curing, and artificial heat curing. In the case of the tobacco\r\nknown as _Perique_ the curing process is more or less peculiar to itself.\r\n\"Sun\" and \"air\" curing are much slower processes than the curing by\r\nartificial heat.\r\n\r\nAll cigar leaf tobacco is sun-cured, and as a general rule pipe smoking\r\nand chewing tobacco are cured by artificial heat.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of drying and curing by artificial heat, the leaf is hung\r\nup in specially constructed curing houses or sheds. It is found that after\r\nthe exposure to the sun for the first process of \"yellowing\" tobacco leaf\r\nstill contains 1 lb. of water approximately in each plant. The first part\r\nof the process of curing consists in drawing off this superfluous\r\nmoisture. Dry heat is applied at a temperature of 90 deg. F. to 120 deg. F. for\r\nabout 16 to 30 hours to effect this. A further exposure of about 48 hours\r\nat a temperature of 125 deg. or so is necessary to complete the curing, and\r\nfix the color.\r\n\r\nThe stems and stalks being thicker take a longer time and generally\r\nrequire 9 to 10 hours further exposure and a temperature which may range\r\nas high as 175 deg. F. before they are fully cured, the temperature being\r\ngraded hourly until the maximum necessary is reached.\r\n\r\nThe process of curing varies considerably in different states. Some\r\ngrowers prefer to put the tobacco into the sheds immediately after\r\ncutting, and allow very little exposure in the fields. The temperature is\r\nusually kept steady at about 90 deg. F. Again the process is different\r\naccording to the quality of tobacco required. For the heavy type of leaf\r\nwhich is intended for the export trade, the curing in the sheds is done by\r\nan _open_ fire, the fuel being usually hardwood logs. The smoky, creosotic\r\nflavor is absorbed by the leaf, and, although this flavor is not relished\r\nby the smokers of the U. S., it is much liked in Europe. The curing in\r\nsuch cases may last for 4 or even 5 days. The tobacco is suspended on\r\npoles by the stalks and the fires are built on the floor immediately under\r\nthem so that the carbonaceous products are easily absorbed by the open\r\npores of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThe chewing and pipe smoking tobacco, as well as cigarette tobaccos\r\nincluding all the bright yellow tobaccos used in the U. S. are usually\r\ncured by _Flue_ curing. In this case the heat comes from pipes which run\r\naround the curing houses and are fed from a furnace in an adjoining\r\nchamber or in a cellar. The temperature can be easily regulated. \"Flue\"\r\ncuring is generally completed in about 4 days. \"Flue\" curing does not clog\r\nup the pores of the leaf which therefore remain more absorbent than in the\r\nopen fire cured tobacco. This is an important matter for the manufacturers\r\nbecause the flue cured leaf will absorb twice as much of the flavoring\r\nsauces (which are added to certain kinds of tobacco) than tobacco leaf\r\ncured by open fires.\r\n\r\nAir exposure of 6 to 8 weeks (sometimes extended to 3 or 4 months) is\r\nnecessary when tobacco is cured by exposure to the sun and air. It is\r\nclaimed, however, that this method of curing preserves far better the\r\nnatural flavor of the leaf; and, where flavor and aroma are highly\r\nimportant, this method is always preferred. Hence all cigar leaf tobaccos\r\nare cured by exposure to natural sunlight and not by artificial heat.\r\n\r\n\"Air\" curing as distinct from sun curing is generally done in open sheds\r\nwhich are thoroughly ventilated and kept as far as possible at a\r\ntemperature of about 75 deg. F. The leaf is usually allowed to cure while\r\nattached to the stalk, but Florida curers generally prefer to strip the\r\nleaf and treat it separately. The finer classes of pipe smoking tobaccos\r\nare air cured.\r\n\r\nAfter the curing is completed the color of the leaf is usually fixed.\r\nGenerally speaking, the riper the leaf the lighter will be its color when\r\ncured. Thus the bottom leaves of the plant will be lighter in color than\r\nthe upper leaves because they are more mature.\r\n\r\n(_For references see end of Chapter VIII_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MARKETING AND SALE OF TOBACCO LEAF\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF DISPOSAL BY THE GROWER. THE WAREHOUSE SYSTEM. DIRECT\r\nPURCHASE. PRINCIPAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES. PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARKETING AND SALE OF TOBACCO LEAF\r\n\r\nWhen the tobacco leaf is fully cured it is at once prepared for the\r\nmarket. The first step is the planters' classification of the leaf. In the\r\ncase of pipe smoking and chewing tobacco the planter collects all the\r\nimperfect, injured leaves, or those inferior from any cause, and ties them\r\nin bundles. These are the planters _lugs_. All other grades are _leaf_.\r\nSlightly injured leaves are classed as _low-leaf_ or _seconds_. The others\r\nare classed _medium_, _good_, _fine_ and _selected_ leaf, according to\r\ngrade, color, quality, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case of cigar leaf tobacco a similar classification is made, more\r\ncare being taken owing to the very great difference in price between the\r\nbetter and poorer qualities. This difference may be as much as 20c in the\r\nlb., the finer and more suitable leaf being eagerly sought for.\r\n\r\nPipe smoking and chewing tobacco leaf is usually packed in hogsheads or\r\ncases each weighing from 1,000 to 1,400 lbs. The operation of packing the\r\nleaf is called \"prizing.\" Cigar leaf is usually put up in \"hands.\" A\r\n\"hand\" consists of from 25 to 75 leaves tied together. Four hands tied\r\ntogether make a \"carrot\" and 80 carrots go to the bale, but the size of\r\nthe bale varies considerably. The tobacco is then ready for the buyer.\r\n\r\nThere are two systems of disposing of the planters' product: (1) direct\r\npurchase by the manufacturer or by a middleman from the grower; and (2)\r\nwhat is known as the warehouse system. In the southern states the\r\nwarehouse system prevails. Every important tobacco section in the south\r\nhas its public warehouse which is under the control and supervision of\r\nstate law. Many of these warehouses are long established, that at\r\nRichmond, Va., dating as far back as 1730, and those at Louisville and\r\nClarksville about 1839.\r\n\r\nOn appointed days the planter brings his leaf to the warehouse. Here it is\r\nentered as \"loose leaf\" or \"inspected leaf.\" In the case of loose leaf,\r\nthe tobacco is open to the inspection of prospective buyers, who examine\r\nit and afterwards bid on it. In the case of \"inspected leaf\" the warehouse\r\nofficials first examine the consignments, grade them and mark them\r\naccording to their judgment, taking samples. The samples are open to\r\nbuyers' inspection and form the basis of sale. Tobacco auctions are\r\nregularly held when the buyers assemble and bid on the \"loose leaf\" and\r\n\"inspected\" lots. Prices of the various grades are fixed and sales take\r\nplace at the day's price.\r\n\r\nThe principal tobacco markets are:\r\n\r\nFor Kentucky and Tennessee--At Louisville, Clarksville and Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nFor Maryland and Ohio--At Baltimore.\r\n\r\nFor North Carolina--At Durham and Winston.\r\n\r\nFor Virginia--At Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe warehouse system has the great advantage that the proceedings are open\r\nand the prices are recorded and published. Hence growers can know how the\r\nmarket fluctuates and judge the best time for sale. This is not the case\r\nwhen the sale is private between the buyer and seller as is customary in\r\nthe eastern and northern states. Here the price actually received by the\r\ngrower is often different from that given out as paid.\r\n\r\nThe price of tobacco leaf has had many vicissitudes during the past 25\r\nyears, the price often having reached so low a point as to discourage\r\nproducers. Thus at Winston, N. C., the price has gradually fallen from\r\n12.3c per lb. in 1889 to 6.3c in 1896. In the same period Burley leaf at\r\nLouisville and Cincinnati fell from 10c to 7-1/2c. Prices similarly\r\ndropped in other centers. The price of cigar leaf has latterly increased.\r\nIn 1900 prices ran from 6 to 15 cents; in 1905 from 8 to 17 cents. Many\r\nconditions at home and abroad affect the price, such as bad harvests or\r\ninferior grades of produce.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco trust has been very unjustly blamed by many for the falling\r\nprice of tobacco. As a matter of fact and record, however, the\r\nconcentration of buying power by eliminating the middleman and the small\r\ndealers has not only placed the grower in a better position by giving him\r\na better price, as recent records show, but it has benefited the consumer\r\nalso who can obtain the superior grades at a lower price. It is the\r\nmiddleman's profit that has been cut. Moreover, the concentrated buying\r\npower of the large interests here has been an effective force in keeping\r\nup tobacco leaf prices against the foreign buyers. It must be remembered\r\nthat about half of our crop is exported. The buyers of this portion, who\r\nare principally the agents of foreign governments (in the cases where\r\ntobacco is a government monopoly as in France, Italy, etc.) assemble at\r\nthe auctions and bid in the usual way. As this competition is very limited\r\nthere is always an opportunity for such buyers to agree among themselves\r\nas to the limit of prices. This has been one of the important factors\r\nwhich has kept the prices of tobacco leaf down. The concentration of\r\nAmerican buying power has, however, been a formidable check on it, the\r\nprices received by the growers being now fair and reasonable, and such as\r\nare the result of a healthy market, where the factors of supply and demand\r\nhave their full share of effect.\r\n\r\nThe government statistics show that for 1914 the prices of leaf varied\r\nfrom 5.5c to 20c for common to good varieties.\r\n\r\n(_For references see end of Chapter VIII_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nREHANDLING AND FERMENTATION OF TOBACCO LEAF PRIOR TO MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF LEAF. TREATMENT AND BLENDING. OBJECTS AND METHODS OF\r\nFERMENTATION. ACTION OF MICROBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nREHANDLING AND FERMENTATION OF TOBACCO LEAF PRIOR TO MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the tobacco passes from the grower to the manufacturer or\r\nleaf dealer. Before it is fitted, however, for manufacture into cigars or\r\nother finished products the leaf must go through many processes, the most\r\nimportant of which is fermentation. These processes, which are usually\r\nknown as rehandling, are carried out in special buildings which are called\r\nleaf houses and stemmeries. The procedures in different leaf houses may\r\nvary somewhat, but the general principles and objects in view are the same\r\nin all. Moreover, the treatment is different, according to the ulterior\r\ndisposition of the leaf, i. e. whether intended for cigars, pipe smoking\r\nor other product.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment as carried out in large establishments is about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe leaf as soon as it is received whether in casks, cases, bales, or\r\notherwise is opened up and inspected in the casing room. Large concerns\r\nwhich manufacture or deal in cigar and other kinds of leaf, sort out the\r\ndifferent kinds suitable for each class of product, i. e. wrappers,\r\nfillers, binders, cigarette leaf, plug leaf, etc. These are distributed\r\nto either special houses or departments. The tobacco leaf when first\r\nreceived is usually dry and brittle. The bundles are carefully opened up\r\nand the leaves loosened and spread out on large trucks where they are\r\nsprayed with water. When the leaf has soaked the water and is pliable it\r\nundergoes a sorting which is done by selecting leaves from different cases\r\nor even bundles of leaves and in a general way arranging them so that each\r\ntruckfull represents a blend of the different kinds of leaf which are\r\nsuitable for the purpose in view. These sorted packages are then roughly\r\nfastened together and after being again sprinkled thoroughly are sent to\r\nthe \"sweating\" room to undergo fermentation which may last several weeks.\r\nThe temperature of this room must be carefully regulated and is usually\r\nkept at about 90 deg. F.\r\n\r\nThe selection and blending of the different kinds of leaf is most\r\nimportant. It requires accurate and expert knowledge in choosing leaves\r\nand kinds possessing different strengths and other qualities and in\r\ncombining them in such proportions that the final effect of the blend\r\ngives just what is required.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in this expert treatment of the leaf before manufacture\r\nthat the greatest advance has been made in the tobacco industry. The\r\nsmoker has the advantage and satisfaction of knowing that not only does he\r\nget the benefit of improved scientific knowledge and sanitary conditions\r\nby which anything that might be harmful or undesirable is removed, but\r\nthat handling the leaf in large quantities effects great economics and\r\nprocures for him the benefit of choicest selected grades at a reduced\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nIt may be said here incidentally that leaves of the very best tobaccos\r\nwhich are defective merely in size, or color, etc., are put through\r\nexactly the same processes as the choicer quality leaves, and are used in\r\nthe manufacture of the popular priced machine-made \"little cigars\" and\r\n\"cheroots.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary now to digress for a short time and consider what\r\nhappens during the process of fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe fermenting of tobacco leaf has for its principal objects, (1) the\r\nremoval of acrid matters, (2) the fixing of the color, and (3) the\r\nproduction of flavor. Fermentation can only take place under suitable\r\nconditions of heat and moisture, and is essentially a chemical process\r\nduring which certain organic compounds stored in the plant are split up\r\nand others formed.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of fermentation takes place in the curing houses during\r\nthe \"yellowing\" of the leaf after it has been harvested, but as we have\r\nseen the main process of fermentation does not occur until it is\r\n\"rehandled\" by the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion held at present as the result of investigation is that\r\nthe transformations which are effected in the leaf are purely the result\r\nof chemical processes. As the plant slowly dies and decomposes special\r\nferments are produced. These ferments set up an oxidization process which\r\nsplits up the complex organic compounds which still exist in the leaf\r\ncells. The starch in the plant is changed into sugar which is slowly\r\nconsumed. There is a decrease in the fats and gummy substances, also in\r\nnicotine and nitrogenous compounds, and there is a formation of certain\r\norganic acids such as malic, citric and oxalic which are essential in the\r\nproduction of flavor. Briefly it may be said that the process is an\r\nattempt by the plant to prolong its existence by feeding on its own\r\nsubstance, by drawing on its own reserves and on its own structure for the\r\nfood which its cells no longer receive through the natural growing\r\nprocess. When the struggle is over the \"fermentation\" is complete. The\r\nnecessity for maturing tobacco has long been known but the exact nature\r\nof the changes that take place during the process were not understood.\r\nSince the discoveries of Louis Pasteur regarding the part played by\r\nbacteria in general fermentative processes it has been generally claimed\r\nby bacteriologists that the changes wrought in the leaf and the production\r\nof flavor are solely the work of bacteria. Although this view has not been\r\nproved it has never been fully disproved, and there appears to be no doubt\r\nthat the microbes known to exist in the leaf during the fermentation\r\nprocess play an important part in the process. Fermentation can only take\r\nplace as stated under suitable conditions of heat and moisture and these\r\nare the conditions which favor the development of microbes and enable them\r\nto work. The results obtained are probably partially due to chemical\r\naction and partly to bacterial action, the two being complementary to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Suchsland, a German scientist, startled the tobacco world by\r\nasserting that the flavor of tobacco was in no way due to the effects of\r\nthe soil and climate where it was grown, but was solely due to microbic\r\naction, and that the specific flavor and aroma of any given tobacco could\r\nbe artificially produced by the cultivation of selected bacteria and\r\nallowing the tobacco to cure and ferment under their action. He conducted\r\na series of experimental investigations in which he searched for and\r\nisolated the specific microbes found in the best West Indian tobacco. From\r\nthese he made artificial cultures and introduced them into heaps of\r\ninferior, coarse German tobacco which was undergoing curing. His results\r\nwere such that the smoking quality of the leaf was entirely changed. It\r\ncould scarcely be distinguished from the best Cuban tobacco and experts\r\nand connoisseurs failed to identify the product as German tobacco. A\r\ncompany was formed to exploit the new ideas commercially, but it does not\r\nappear to have met with success. Other investigations failed to obtain\r\nSuchsland's results and extensive investigation in the Agricultural\r\nExperimental Station in the United States have not up to now produced any\r\nresults confirmatory of the theory.\r\n\r\nWe can now proceed to follow the course of the tobacco in its\r\nperegrinations through the leaf house.\r\n\r\nOn their return from the first fermentation the bundles go to the picking\r\ndepartment. Leaves which are damaged or unsuitable in any way are here\r\npicked out and put aside to be used in the cheaper grades. The leaves are\r\nthen subjected to a thorough cleaning to remove particles of sand, clay,\r\netc., packed tightly in bundles and returned to the sweating department\r\nto undergo further fermentation and to allow for a thorough interchange of\r\nthe aroma of the different blends. In due course the bundles pass to the\r\nstemming department for the removal of the midribs which usually form\r\nnearly one-third of the entire weight. The resulting half leaves are then\r\narranged in piles of 50, each pile forming a \"book.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the stemming department the books pass to the drying room where any\r\nsuperfluous moisture is removed by hot air currents.\r\n\r\nFrom the drying room the books pass to the ordering room where they\r\nundergo inspection for color, size, etc., and subjected to further\r\ntreatment if necessary. Here they are finally packed in cases and stored\r\nfor several months to allow perfect and uniform blending after which they\r\nare ready for shipment to the factory. Filler leaf for the finest cigars\r\nmay stand in these cases for two or three years.\r\n\r\nLeaf which is intended for chewing or pipe smoking is not subjected to so\r\ngreat an elaboration of processes as cigar leaf, as the matters of\r\nuniformity of color, and delicacy as well as individuality of aroma are\r\nnot of such great importance. Usually such tobacco leaf is fermented in\r\nbulk, and the removal of the stems is done before the principal\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary selection of varieties, sorting, stemming and\r\ncleaning, the leaf is dipped into large vats containing flavors; and after\r\ndrying are subjected to steaming. They are then packed away in bulk in the\r\nsweating department where they slowly ferment until required for use.\r\nThese \"bulks\" or stacks may contain many tons of leaf. They require\r\nconstant turning over, etc. Indeed it may be said that every step in these\r\nprocesses requires constant care. Temperature, moisture, length of\r\nexposure, etc., must all be carefully seen to. Otherwise the tobacco will\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of tobacco leaf intended for export trade rehandling consists\r\nmainly of stemming and removal of moisture. This is done before shipment\r\nin order to reduce the weight as customs duty is levied in accordance with\r\nthe weight of the imported packages in the countries importing.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nU.

AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTED, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURED PRODUCTS OF TOBACCO. GENERAL REMARKS\r\n\r\nThe importance and magnitude of the tobacco manufacturing industry in the\r\nUnited States will be best understood from a consideration of the\r\nfollowing statistics taken from the latest available government records:\r\n\r\n(_For all Manufactured Products_)\r\n\r\n  Cost of materials used      (1905)==$126,000,000\r\n                              (1909)== 177,000,000\r\n  Value of the product        (1905)== 331,000,000\r\n                              (1909)== 417,000,000\r\n  No. of establishments       (1905)==      16,828\r\n                              (1909)==      15,822\r\n  No. of persons employed,\r\n  more than one-third being\r\n  women                       (1905)==     160,000\r\n                              (1909)==     197,000\r\n\r\nThe figures are given in round numbers. The total capital invested in this\r\nindustry is between $300,000,000 and $400,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere are more than one and a quarter millions acres in the U. S. under\r\ncultivation of tobacco which yields a crop at present approximating to\r\n1,000 million lbs. of leaf annually.\r\n\r\nThe industry shows an absolutely increasing condition in every particular\r\nat each census. During the past 45 years the value of the product has\r\nincreased more than $300,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trade in manufacturing in the U. S. there is the export\r\ntrade principally in unmanufactured leaf. This amounts at present to about\r\n$54,000,000 annually. The price of export leaf has been continuously\r\nincreasing despite of the fact that the production of leaf abroad is\r\nincreasing. Thus in 1886 the average export price of leaf from the U. S.\r\nwas 8-1/2c per lb. In 1914 it was more than 12c.\r\n\r\nThe following statement shows at a glance the marvelous increase in the\r\ntobacco industry:\r\n\r\n_Comparative Statement of Manufactured Tobacco in the U. S.

This was\r\ndistributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  To Great Britain and Ireland     174 million lbs.\r\n  To Canada                         17    \"     \"\r\n  To France                         55    \"     \"\r\n  To Germany                        32    \"     \"\r\n  To Italy                          45    \"     \"\r\n  To Netherlands                    28    \"     \"\r\n  To Spain                          17    \"     \"\r\n  To Japan                          16    \"     \"\r\n  To China                          11    \"     \"\r\n  To Belgium                        11    \"     \"\r\n  To Africa, Australia, etc.        43    \"     \"\r\n                                  ----\r\n  Total                            449    \"     \"\r\n\r\nThe largest export manufacturing trade was to Asia, the cigarettes\r\nexported there having a value of 2-1/2 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of manufacturing products of tobacco in the U. S. has\r\nincreased continuously since 1863 when it was 1.6 lbs. per head to the\r\npresent time when it is 5-1/2 lbs. per head of the total population. This\r\nworks out at about 16 lbs. per head for each male over 16 years. The\r\nconsumption of tobacco in the U. S. is higher than in any other country\r\nand has increased more rapidly. For the past 40 years the consumption per\r\nhead in U. S. has increased 240%; in England 56%; in France 24%; in\r\nGermany 23%. From this fact different deductions might be made. It may be\r\nthat the Americans smoke more because they are fonder of tobacco than\r\nEuropeans; or because they get better and cheaper tobacco; or because they\r\ncan better afford to buy tobacco. The greatest percentage of increase in\r\nthe United States is in the consumption of cigars.\r\n\r\nThe manufactured products are classed as (1) cigars, (2) pipe smoking and\r\nchewing tobaccos, (3) cigarettes, (4) snuff. To each of these separate\r\nchapters will be devoted.\r\n\r\n(_For references see Chapter XV_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCIGARS. HISTORICAL AND GENERAL FACTS\r\n\r\nHISTORY. STATISTICAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE CIGAR BUSINESS IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGARS. HISTORICAL AND GENERAL FACTS\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards landed for the first time on American soil they found\r\nthe natives smoking the rolled-up tobacco leaves, that is a cigar. For a\r\ncigar is nothing more, four centuries having made little change in the\r\nCuban cigar. The word _cigar_ is most probably derived from the Spanish\r\nword _cigarer_--to roll. Other derivations are given, but this seems\r\netymologically the correct one; and we will rest content with it. In\r\nSpanish America to the present day the custom of smoking tobacco in the\r\nrolled form, either as cigars or cigarettes, prevails, rather than the\r\ncustom of smoking in pipes which was the method of the northern aborigines\r\nfrom whom the English colonists adopted it. Smoking was introduced into\r\nSpain in the cigar form and into England in the pipe form. Cigars,\r\nhowever, at the present time, both in North and South America, form the\r\nprincipal item in the tobacco account of the people; we shall therefore\r\nenter somewhat fully into matters concerning their manufacture, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as stated, it is in the cigar form that smoking was introduced\r\ninto Spain, it was not till about 1790 that cigars were used generally in\r\nEurope. A factory for the manufacture of cigars was established at\r\nHamburg in 1796. The custom did not spread rapidly and did not reach any\r\nconsiderable proportion in England till about 1830 when the high duties\r\nwere considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nCigar making has always been a staple industry in Cuba. It was there when\r\nthe Europeans landed and it is there still. Its record is unbroken. There\r\nwas always a greater or lesser exportation to Europe and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIGAR BUSINESS OF THE U. S.\r\n\r\nOf the various manufactured products of tobacco leaf, the cigar trade is\r\nthe most important in the U. S., its value being greater than that of all\r\nother tobacco products combined.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this branch of the tobacco business may be gauged when we\r\nstate that at the present time there are made annually in the U. S. cigars\r\nof all kinds to the amount of about 8-1/2 billions. The Census Bureau\r\nReport for 1912 shows that for that year the number of full-sized cigars\r\nmade and on which tax was paid was in round numbers 7,500,000,000, and of\r\n\"little cigars,\" that is under the regular size, about 1,000,000,000.\r\nThese figures are certainly stupendous, particularly when we consider\r\nthat, in addition, at least several hundred more were imported and that\r\nonly about 2,000,000 were exported. Uncle Sam evidently likes to smoke\r\ncigars.\r\n\r\nTo make these cigars requires a consumption of 136 million lbs. of cigar\r\nleaf. Nearly 50 million lbs. of this is imported at a gross cost\r\n(exclusive of duties) of about 35 million dollars, the rest of the leaf is\r\nhome grown. The principal imports are from Cuba. In 1912 we imported cigar\r\nleaf from Cuba in amount nearly 23 million lbs. and in 1913 this increased\r\nto over 27 million lbs. valued at more than 16 million dollars. The\r\nimports of East Indian (Sumatran) leaf varies from 6 to 8 million lbs. and\r\ncosts from 7 to 8 million dollars.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of imported leaf used in cigar making shows a steady\r\nincrease, being now more than 50% greater than a decade ago, yet the\r\nproportion of foreign leaf to home-grown leaf in the whole manufacture\r\nshows a steady decrease. This speaks well for the improving quality of\r\nAmerican grown leaf.\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States about 26,000 cigar factories, both large\r\nand small. The large number of establishments is due to the fact that\r\ncigar making is still to a large extent a hand-making industry. About\r\n135,000 persons are directly employed in the manufacture, nearly half of\r\nwhom are women. The capital engaged in the business is reported as 150\r\nmillions and the value of the product 200 million dollars annually. The\r\nactual consumer pays about 300 million dollars for the cigars smoked, the\r\ndifference between the cost of the product and the latter figure being the\r\nexpense and profit of the retail handlers. The enormous growth of the\r\ncigar trade is seen when it is compared with 1860. In that year the annual\r\nvalue of this product was only 9 million dollars. The two states of New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania are the centers of cigar manufacture. Between them\r\nthey make nearly half of the entire product, Pennsylvania leading with\r\nabout two thousand million cigars annually. Florida makes about 300\r\nmillion. The price paid by the consumer works out to an average of about\r\n4c for each cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCIGAR MAKING\r\n\r\nHAND-MADE CIGARS. MACHINE-MADE CIGARS. CLASSIFICATION OF CIGARS. TERMS\r\nUSED IN THE CIGAR TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGAR MAKING\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that modern progress should invade and revolutionize the\r\nold and slow methods of cigar making; and so it has. Smoking is a\r\nsentimental occupation and lends itself easily to romantic associations. A\r\ngood deal of romance and sentiment still hangs around the hand-made cigar\r\nand cigarette. In an up-to-date cigar factory, however, the whir of\r\nmachinery and the precise, regular movements of automatic contrivances\r\ngive little scope for sentiment.\r\n\r\nUp to 1870 cigars were hand-made. All that was necessary was an\r\ninexpensive board, a cutting knife, and a block of wood with a stationary\r\nknife, known as a \"tuck,\" for measuring and cutting the finished cigar.\r\n\r\nAbout the time stated the \"mold\" was introduced. The mold is a wooden\r\nblock about 18\" x 6\" x 3\", a tool which facilitates the shaping of the\r\n\"bunch\" or filler part of the cigar and presses it into shape. This mold\r\nis now used in most \"hand-made\" cigar factories where the labor is\r\nsubdivided into \"bunch-makers\" and \"rollers,\" the latter putting on the\r\nbinder and wrapper and finishing the cigar.\r\n\r\nIt is the introduction of practically automatic machinery, however, which\r\nis revolutionizing the cigar-making business, and slowly but surely\r\ndriving the \"hand-made\" cigar into the position occupied by the\r\n\"hand-made\" cigarette. And the writer cannot see why this should not be\r\nso. As it has been said, there is much sentiment about hand-made cigars.\r\nBut common sense seems to be on the side of the machine. We quite\r\nunderstand the difficulty of killing old prejudices and time honored\r\ncustoms; but it is difficult to understand how the flavor or quality of a\r\ncigar filler can be different whether it is pressed into the shape by a\r\nmachine or by the hand of a workman; or what the precise improvement is\r\nwhen a wrapper leaf is put on and licked by a workman rather than by a\r\nclean machine under perfect sanitary conditions. However, sentiment still\r\npersists. Imaginary, or perhaps real, charms are ascribed to the hand-made\r\ngoods and the smoker is willing and even wishful to pay a higher price for\r\nhis fancy. The result is that the small factory is still predominant. It\r\ndepends more on labor than on capital. But the large factories have an\r\nimmense production. The condition will be best shown by stating that in\r\nless than 1 per cent of the cigar making establishments of the U. S.\r\nnearly 50 per cent of the entire output is made, or, putting it another\r\nway, nearly three-fourths of all the licensed cigar factories produced\r\nless than one-tenth of the product. Of the 26,000 establishments in the U.\r\nS. only in 2 is the annual output more than 50 million and in 27 the\r\noutput runs from 25 to 50 million. Pennsylvania establishments,\r\nprincipally in Philadelphia, produce 28% of the entire U. S. cigar output;\r\nNew York State, principally New York City, comes next with about 20%; and\r\nOhio, principally Cincinnati, third with about 8%.\r\n\r\nFor machine-made goods the principal machines used are the bunch rollers\r\nand the suction table. The former rolls the bunch of filler leaves and\r\npresses them into shape. The suction table is used for wrapping the cigar.\r\nThe operator places the wrapper leaf on a perforated plate. By pressing a\r\nfoot lever a vacuum is created beneath this plate which holds the leaf\r\nsmooth and snug against the table. The perforated plate is exactly the\r\nform which the wrapper must be to properly fit the cigar. It is easily cut\r\naround and trimmed to shape. The bunch from the bunch roller is then\r\nquickly encased in the wrapper. Human labor is necessary only to feed the\r\nmachines and to spread the wrappers. 25,000 bunches can easily be wrapped\r\nin a week at a cost of $6 to $9 for labor (principally female) and the\r\nupkeep of the machine. This in labor alone would formerly cost as much as\r\n$75.00. In the smaller \"hand-made\" factories, the method of procedure is\r\nabout as follows: The leaf on receipt is opened and moistened. The\r\n\"filler\" leaf is separated from the wrapper. The filler leaf is made up\r\ninto \"books,\" a \"book\" being a bunch of leaves suitable for one cigar. The\r\nloose books are then allowed to ferment for a week or so when they are\r\nready for use. The bunchmaker selects and arranges his leaves from each\r\nbook, selects his binder and rolls the whole into cigar form. If a mold is\r\nused he puts the bunch in a matrix of the mold and fastens down the cover\r\nuntil the leaves are pressed into shape. They then go to the wrapper man\r\nand are wrapped either by machine or by hand, according to the class of\r\ngoods. The wrapping is begun at the lighting end and finished at the point\r\nwhich is called the head. After trimming to gauge, the cigar is ready for\r\ninspection and classification according to color, etc., and for banding.\r\n\r\nCigars according to their manufacture are classed for trade purposes in\r\nvarious ways. The trade nomenclature embraces the following descriptions:\r\nCigars, little cigars, all-tobacco cigars, stogies and cheroots.\r\n\r\nCigars proper have many subdivisions:\r\n\r\n    (1) IMPORTED CIGARS. This term is usually confined to cigars made in\r\n    Cuba, and does not include Porto Rican or Philippines.\r\n\r\n    (2) PORTO RICO CIGARS. }\r\n                           } Used for cigars made in those places.\r\n    (3) PHILIPPINE CIGARS. }\r\n\r\n    (4) CLEAR HAVANAS. This term denotes a cigar made by hand in the U. S.\r\n    of Cuban tobacco exclusively and in the same style as in Cuba.\r\n\r\n    (5) SEED AND HAVANA. Up to about 50 years ago there were no clear\r\n    Havanas made in the U. S., the best produced being a combination of\r\n    Havana leaf and leaf grown in the states from imported Havana seed.\r\n    Hence the term which ordinarily means an American made cigar, the\r\n    filler being wholly or partly of Cuban tobacco and the wrapper, a\r\n    domestic or Sumatran leaf.\r\n\r\n    (6) DOMESTIC CIGARS. This term is used for cigars made in the U. S. in\r\n    contra-distinction to imported cigars.\r\n\r\n    (7) NICKEL GOODS. Ordinary 5c cigars made either entirely, of domestic\r\n    tobacco or with a Sumatran wrapper, and usually made partly or wholly\r\n    by machine. It also usually includes \"segundos\" or \"seconds,\" i. e.,\r\n    cigars of a better type made to sell at higher prices but which on\r\n    account of some defect are rejected on inspection. Sometimes clear\r\n    Havanas made of scrap filler and inferior wrapper are included. These\r\n    cigars have a vast variety of designations and make up the general\r\n    stock of most cigar stores. The cost of production does not usually\r\n    exceed $20.00 per thousand and they sell to dealers at from $25.00 to\r\n    $30.00.\r\n\r\n    (8) STOGIES, TOBIES, ETC. CHEROOTS. Cigar shaped rolls of cheap\r\n    domestic tobacco made quickly by machine, and of various sizes.\r\n    Cheroots are open at both ends. The filler of stogies is usually a\r\n    western grown leaf of full size, but rough quality. They are\r\n    manufactured principally in Louisville, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh,\r\n    Wheeling, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the large tobacco companies operates about 25 large cigar factories\r\nin various centers of the U. S. Here are made all classes of domestic\r\ncigars, but all are made under the same conditions of sanitation, economic\r\nhandling and strict supervision. The leaf is prepared, selected,\r\nfermented, blended, etc., in the company's own special leaf houses and is\r\ndespatched to the various factories as needed. All the better class of\r\ndomestic cigars are hand-made, machinery being used in making the cheaper\r\ngrades. There are special factories for the making of \"little cigars,\" of\r\nwhich a vast number are made on account of their popularity. These include\r\nthe package goods and those put up in cardboard boxes of which such brands\r\nas \"Virginia Cheroots\" and \"Royal Bengals\" are types. By the terms \"little\r\ncigar\" the trade recognizes all cigars under the regular standard size and\r\nwhich weigh less than 3 pounds per thousand. In some \"little cigar\"\r\nfactories these little cigars are not made from inferior leaf. They are\r\nmade usually from the small leaves of the tobacco intended for higher\r\npriced goods, but which on account of faulty size cannot be used. The leaf\r\nis, however, cured and prepared in exactly the same way. In addition the\r\n\"scrap\" or waste portions of the high priced leaf is used for fillers for\r\nlittle cigars. The little cigars of this type are usually of first-rate\r\nquality and on account of their small cost give excellent value to the\r\nsmoker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGARS. MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nThere are a good many terms used in the cigar trade to denote color, size,\r\nquality, etc., which smokers should know the meaning of. Most of these\r\nterms are Spanish, because the cigar trade was for a long time confined to\r\nCuba.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terms used to denote the quality of cigar leaf_\r\n\r\nDESECHO. The finest quality; the top leaves of plant; best because they\r\nhave received most sunshine and dew.\r\n\r\nDESECHITO. Good leaves but inferior to desecho.\r\n\r\nLIBRA. Good leaves but small in size; the smaller top and bottom leaves.\r\n\r\nINJURIADO. Injured leaves; root leaves soil stained and injured by\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terms used to denote color_\r\n\r\nNote: The color term refers to the wrapper only. Many smokers judge the\r\nmildness or strength of a cigar by its outside color. This is a fallacy.\r\nThe wrapper constitutes only about 2 per cent of the cigar weight.\r\nMoreover color is no criterion of strength. The darkest cigar may be and\r\nusually is very mild. The color is due (1) to the soil, (2) to the age of\r\nthe plant when cut, and (3) to the length of time of curing and\r\nfermentation. As a general rule the lighter the color the more inferior\r\nand immature is the tobacco. Cigar smokers should remember this.\r\n\r\nCLARO or CLARA. Very light colored. The lightest shade known in selected\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO. Red; medium in color.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO CLARA. Light Brown.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO MADURO. Dark Brown.\r\n\r\nMADURO.

The Spanish terms refer to the cigar\r\nitself and not to the maker. They may be used by any maker, and no longer\r\nrefer to any standard of excellence.\r\n\r\n(_See references end of Chapter XV_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCIGARS AND THEIR QUALITIES\r\n\r\nQUALITIES OF CIGARS AND CIGAR LEAF. IMPORTED CIGARS. HAVANAS. DOMESTIC\r\nCIGARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGARS AND THEIR QUALITIES\r\n\r\nA cigar consists essentially of three distinct parts: the body or inner\r\npart called the _filler_; the covering of the filler which is called the\r\n_binder_; and the outside finishing cover which is called the _wrapper_.\r\nCuban cigars, however, consist of filler and wrapper only.\r\n\r\nExcept in the case of cigars made in Cuba the wrapper leaf is usually of a\r\ndifferent class of tobacco from the rest of the cigar, as the qualities to\r\nbe fulfilled by each part is different. The qualities required in a cigar\r\nmust be viewed both from the smokers' and the manufacturers' standpoints\r\nand the leaf must be such as to conform to these qualities. Thus the\r\nsmoker is concerned with the burning quality, the taste, flavor, aroma,\r\ncolor, general appearance and strength of the cigar. The manufacturer in\r\naddition to seeking leaf that will answer the smokers' requirements also\r\nhas an eye to economy and requires the leaf to have qualities regarding\r\nsize, weight, texture, etc. Therefore, in the best cigar leaf the\r\nfollowing qualities are more or less essential: (1) good color, (2) fair\r\nbody, (3) a continuous pleasant aroma, (4) fine texture combined with a\r\ncertain toughness, (5) small ribs and veins, (6) good combustion so that\r\nit will hold fire for 4 or five minutes. The burning must be free and\r\neven with a white or whitish-brown ash which remains intact until cigar is\r\nthree-fourths smoked, (7) good size of leaf, (8) must be elastic and\r\nsouple, must not be brittle, (9) it must be free from spots and light in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nSome of these qualities are essential in filler leaf; some in wrapper\r\nleaf. Thus the _color_ of filler leaf does not matter; neither does the\r\naroma of the wrapper the essential qualities of which are color, lightness\r\nand elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe cigars consumed in the U. S. are either (a) Imported or (b) Home\r\nManufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) IMPORTED CIGARS\r\n\r\nThe most important of the imported cigars are those that come from Cuba,\r\nPorto Rico and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Civil War cigars were imported principally from\r\nGermany and Cuba and the value was about 4-1/2 million dollars annually.\r\nHigh import duties have, however, altered this and the number of imported\r\ncigars is nearly 90 per cent less than formerly. The value of the import\r\nhas not, however, fallen so much, that is to say only the higher grades of\r\ncigars are imported. The value of cigars now imported does not exceed 3\r\nmillion dollars annually and they are principally Cuban.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBAN, OR SO-CALLED HAVANA, CIGARS\r\n\r\nAs the strictest laws are enforced in Cuba against the importation of\r\ntobacco, it follows that all genuine so-called Havana cigars are made of\r\nCuban tobacco. The Havana Tobacco Co. controls about 260,000 acres of the\r\nbest Cuban tobacco land and has 25 factories in the City of Havana. Here\r\nHavana cigars are made in all grades from those which can be bought at 2\r\nfor 25c to those which cost $2.00 each. The high priced are very limited\r\nin quality, being made from tobacco grown in specially favored districts.\r\nThe Province of Pinar del Rio produces 70 per cent of the whole Cuban\r\ncrop, and includes the celebrated District of Vuelta Abajo in which the\r\nfinest cigar tobacco in the world is grown; the Provinces of Havana and\r\nSanta Clara each produces about 13 per cent of the Cuban crop. Havana\r\nPartidio leaf is of very fine quality and is used principally as wrappers\r\nof clear Havanas. Havana Remedios leaf comes from Santa Clara, has a high\r\nflavor, rather heavy body and is used mostly for fillers.\r\n\r\nThe very finest Havana cigars never leave Cuba, for the merchant keeps\r\nthem for his own use. He is a smoker before a trader. The crop of the very\r\nbest Vuelta Abajo tobacco is so small that not more than about 30,000\r\ncigars can be made from it. These are kept for private purchasers and\r\nnone go on the market. The finest Havanas are of an even tint of rich dark\r\nbrown, free from all stains and spots, burning freely to a white or\r\nwhitish-brown ash, and holding fire for 4 or 5 minutes. Altogether the\r\nDistrict of Vuelta Abajo produces about one-quarter million bales of leaf\r\nannually and about one-tenth of this is high class and produces up to 20\r\ndollars per lb. on the spot.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, Cuban cigars have no binder. They consist of filler\r\nand wrapper only and are all hand-made. The unique position which these\r\ncigars have held for so long is due not only to perfect curing and\r\nblending of the leaf, but also to the superior skill of the Cuban workmen\r\nwho are the most expert cigarmakers and blenders in the world, and who in\r\nthe best factories are allowed to take all the time they need in making\r\nthe cigar. Some of these \"Tabacqueros\" have been making the same brand of\r\ncigar for 20 years or longer.\r\n\r\nOf the total annual output of Cuban made cigars, England takes about 40\r\nper cent, the U. S. about 25 per cent and Germany 13 per cent. In 1913,\r\nthe U. S. imported 659,358 lbs. of cigars and cheroots from Cuba valued\r\nfor $3,999,410.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO CIGARS\r\n\r\nFrom Porto Rico the U. S. ships about 125 million cigars annually.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE CIGARS\r\n\r\nThe laws in force between the U. S. and the Philippine Islands, governing\r\nthe tariff, provide for the importation annually from the Philippines to\r\nthe U. S. free of import duties, of cigar wrapper leaf and filler leaf\r\nmixed or packed with more than 15 per cent of wrapper leaf, not in excess\r\nof 300,000 lbs.; of filler leaf alone not in excess of 1,000,000 lbs.; and\r\nmanufactured cigars in number not exceeding 150,000,000. The shipping must\r\nbe direct.\r\n\r\nAs the Philippine leaf is excellent and labor there is cheap, the U. S.\r\nsmoker is thus enabled to get a very good smoke at a small cost. The full\r\nnumber of cigars allowed at least is imported. In 1913 the importation of\r\nPhilippine cigars and cheroots to the U. S. was 1,641,832 lbs. valued at\r\n$2,296,823.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME MANUFACTURED CIGARS\r\n\r\nFor the home manufactured cigar trade the leaf used is either imported or\r\nhome grown.\r\n\r\nImported cigar leaf comes principally from Cuba, Dutch East Indies\r\n(Sumatra, Java, etc.), Porto Rico, Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nImported Cuban leaf is used both as fillers and wrappers. The U. S. as\r\nalready stated imports about 26 million lbs. annually. The leaf varies in\r\nlength from 8\" to 18\"; is a rich brown color, and its principal\r\ncharacteristic is its fine flavor and aroma, which is unequalled by any\r\nother tobacco in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Sumatran leaf is perhaps more important in the U. S. cigar trade than\r\nthe Cuban leaf. It is used exclusively as wrappers, on account of its fine\r\nlight brown color, its elastic texture and light weight. The genuine\r\nimported leaf is much less in weight than that grown from Sumatran seed in\r\nFlorida. About 2 lbs. of imported Sumatran leaf will wrap 1,000 cigars.\r\nIts length is usually from 14 to 20 inches and the U. S. imports annually\r\nabout 7 million lbs., valued at about 5 million dollars. The use of\r\nSumatran leaf as a wrapper for home-made cigars has increased remarkably\r\nin the last quarter century. In the quinquennium ending 1885 the number of\r\nsuch cigars was 34 millions. In the last quinquennium the number exceeded\r\n2,000 millions.\r\n\r\nThe Sumatran leaf has little aroma or flavor and its value is for\r\nappearance only. The average prices paid by the United States for imported\r\ncigar leaf in 1914 was: for leaf suitable for cigar making, 127c per lb.;\r\nfor \"other leaf,\" 50.44c per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER IMPORTED CIGAR LEAF\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of tax-free manufactured cigars from the\r\nPhilippines the importation of leaf has declined.\r\n\r\nMexican leaf is used as a substitute for Cuban, to which it is inferior.\r\n\r\nThe imports of cigar leaf tobacco from Porto Rico and Brazil are\r\nrelatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGAR LEAF TOBACCO GROWN IN THE U. S.\r\n\r\nThe home grown tobacco leaf used in the cigar manufacturing trade of the\r\nU. S. is grown principally in the states of Connecticut, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida, Georgia, and Texas. The\r\nConnecticut leaf is used for wrappers and binders. The Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania leaf almost exclusively for fillers. Wisconsin produces\r\nbinder leaf particularly. The leaf grown elsewhere is used mostly as\r\nwrappers. It is usual, however, to use the imported and Sumatran leaf as\r\nwrappers for all high class home-made cigars.\r\n\r\nThe finest American grown wrapper leaf is raised in Connecticut. The best\r\nknown brands are known as Connecticut Seedleaf and Connecticut Broadleaf,\r\nboth varieties raised originally from imported Havana seed. The leaf is\r\ndestitute of thick fibers and has a fine texture. They run from 14\" to 26\"\r\nin length, giving good wrapping capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania leaf is also classed as Seed and Broadleaf. It is about\r\nthe same size as the Connecticut, but does not equal it in quality. The\r\nprincipal varieties in Ohio are the Gebhardt, Zimmer, Spanish, and Little\r\nDutch. These do not usually exceed 20\" in length. Florida cigar leaf is\r\nusually small, running from 10\" to 14\" in length.\r\n\r\n(_For references see Chapter XV_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPIPE SMOKING AND CHEWING TOBACCOS\r\n\r\nQUALITIES REQUIRED. DESCRIPTION OF KINDS. PERIQUE TOBACCO. STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPE SMOKING AND CHEWING TOBACCOS\r\n\r\nFor pipe smoking mixtures the tobacco leaf used is of various kinds.\r\nPreferred strains of leaf from Virginia, North and South Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, and East Ohio, to which is added sometimes\r\nTurkish, Latakia, Perique, and a little Havana. The blend is made while\r\nthe tobacco is in leaf form, portions of the desired kinds being assembled\r\nin accordance with a formula followed by the manufacturer. The leaf is\r\nthen put through the required mechanical processes.\r\n\r\nThe qualities necessary in pipe smoking tobaccos are that it must burn\r\nevenly, slowly, smoothly and thoroughly; it must have an agreeable aroma;\r\nit must not cause a burning or acrid sensation in the mouth when smoked;\r\nit is desirable that its nicotine contents should be low. Appearance is\r\nnot of any consequence, but the manufacturer looks for leaf that, in\r\naddition to the above qualities, is free from gumminess as this interferes\r\nwith granulation and cutting; also that the leaf may be a good absorbing\r\nkind in order that it may imbibe the juices with which this class of\r\nmanufactured tobacco is treated both for chewing and pipe smoking.\r\n\r\nAs the taste of smokers with regard to the flavor and aroma of pipe\r\ntobacco varies considerably, some desiring a strong, others a mild or\r\nlight tobacco, this must be taken into account by the manufacturer and the\r\nblends graded accordingly.\r\n\r\nPipe smoking tobaccos are distinguished according to the different\r\nmechanical processes used in their production. Thus there are (1)\r\n_Granulated_, (2) _Plug-cut_, (3) _Long-cut_, (4) _Fine-cut_, etc. In\r\nformer days it was customary for smokers to buy their tobacco in the roll\r\nor twist and cut and manipulate it themselves. This custom has, however,\r\npassed away almost entirely in the U. S. It still survives to a large\r\nextent in Europe where smokers prefer their tobacco moist. In the U. S.\r\npipe smoking tobacco is usually cut and ready for the pipe and sold in\r\npackages or cans.\r\n\r\nGRANULATED is tobacco that has been flaked by breaking or cutting machines\r\nwith blunt teeth or saws and then passed over a series of oscillating\r\nsieves of graded mesh.\r\n\r\nPLUG-CUT or CUT-PLUG is first made into plugs by pressure. These plugs are\r\nthen cut into thin slices convenient for crumbling. The slices are put up\r\nin packages in which form the smoker uses it. Special forms of cut-plug\r\nare, bird's-eye, short-cut, cube-cut, straight-cut, curly-cut, wavy-cut\r\nand cavendish-cut; the name being determined by the shape of the cut\r\nslices. \"Navy-cut\" is a particular kind of plug which was originally\r\nprepared directly by shipmen.\r\n\r\nLONG-CUT tobacco is leaf cut into long shreds. It differs from plug-cut in\r\nnot having been pressed into solid plugs before cutting.\r\n\r\nFINE-CUT is finer and shorter shreds than the long-cut, and the tobacco\r\nused is usually of a less gummy kind.\r\n\r\nOther varieties known in the trade are:\r\n\r\nGERMAN SMOKING. A coarse-grained, heavy tobacco with strong flavor. It is\r\na coarse granulated tobacco.\r\n\r\nSTRIPS. A fine shredded or powdered tobacco used principally in the mining\r\ncamps of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSCRAP. Smoking tobacco made up from cigar clippings and cheap cigar leaf\r\nof the filler and binder type.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIQUE TOBACCO\r\n\r\nPerique tobacco is a specially dark, rich variety having special qualities\r\nwhich render it desirable as a component in pipe smoking mixtures, or for\r\nstraight smoking. Genuine Perique is grown and prepared only in the Parish\r\nof St. James in the State of Louisiana by the descendants of the old\r\nFrench Colonists. The properties which it possesses are essentially due to\r\nthe peculiar method of curing and fermentation and not to any peculiarity\r\nin the leaf itself. It is the only tobacco in the United States that is\r\ngrown and put in its final condition for the consumer by the farmer. It is\r\nsaid that the output of genuine Perique is small, being well under 50,000\r\nlbs. annually. But there is a good deal of substitute Perique sold in lieu\r\nof the genuine kind.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco is raised on a black, deep, exceedingly rich soil. The leaf is\r\nmedium in size, about 18\" long, and a rapid grower. The stem is small, the\r\nfiber tough and gummy.\r\n\r\nIn curing no artificial heat is used. The leaf is hung in sheds for about\r\n10 days. It is then stripped into half leaves. These are taken in bundles\r\nof about 20 each and converted into rough \"twists.\" A dozen or so \"twists\"\r\nare packed in a box 11\" square the weight being about 50 lbs. The contents\r\nof the box are then submitted to a pressure of about 7000 lbs. for at\r\nleast 24 hours. The tobacco is then taken out and the twists again opened\r\nup. The leaves are exposed to the air and sunlight until an exudate\r\nappears on them and is reabsorbed. This is done over and over again for at\r\nleast 10 days or until in appearance the tobacco is quite black. That is\r\nto say the curing of Perique is accomplished by allowing it to soak its\r\nown juice and then submitting to heavy pressure and repeating this process\r\nseveral times. When the leaf is cured it is made into rolls or \"carottes.\"\r\nA cotton cloth 24\" x 18\" is taken and covered with leaves. Others are\r\nspread crosswise over these. Then rolled and a thin rope is wound very\r\ntightly about each bundle or \"carotte.\" This process like the curing is\r\nrepeated over and over again. One man can handle about 10 carottes in a\r\nday, the weight being about 4 lbs. each.\r\n\r\nPerique is considered to have a finer aroma than any other pipe smoking\r\ntobacco and its presence in a mixture is at once detected by the\r\nexperienced smoker. It is said to contain only 1/4 of the citric acid, 1/2\r\nof the nitric acid and 6 times as much acetic acid as tobacco cured in\r\nair. The resultant aroma is rich and fragrant, and the taste is smooth,\r\ndelicate and agreeable. It is also claimed that it stimulates the brain\r\nwithout in any way being hurtful to the digestive or nervous systems.\r\n\r\nWhen the carottes are finally made it is usual to leave them under\r\npressure for at least 12 months. The aroma is said to improve as the\r\ntobacco grows older.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that much of the Perique tobacco is a substitute\r\nfor the genuine. This substitute is made by taking inferior leaf and\r\nsubmitting it to a similar process, i. e., pressure and oxidation\r\nrepeatedly. The process is abridged but a black tobacco results\r\nparticularly when certain darkening ingredients are added. The moral is if\r\nyou want genuine Perique be sure where you get it, and don't grudge the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEWING TOBACCO\r\n\r\nThe particular qualities required in leaf for this purpose are toughness,\r\nsweetness of taste, and a richness in oils and gums. Suitable leaf having\r\nbeen selected the leaf is cut and moulded into small plugs or \"chews\"\r\nwhich are put up in boxes for the market. Flavoring essences are of course\r\nplentifully used.\r\n\r\nAs well as plug, chewing tobacco may be of the variety known as _twist_,\r\nthe leaves being spun and twisted in a continuous roll.\r\n\r\nThe plug consists of a wrapper and filler like the cigar, the brighter and\r\nbetter grades of leaf being used as wrappers. Burley leaf and the yellow\r\nleaf tobacco of Virginia, Kentucky and the Carolinas are principally used.\r\nThe substances used for flavoring are liquorice, cane sugar, maple sugar,\r\nmolasses, and rum, principally. The plugs are packed in boxes of 72 lbs.\r\neach, and also smaller boxes of 10 and 12 lbs. each.\r\n\r\nThe principal centers of the manufacture of pipe smoking and chewing\r\ntobacco are Missouri (St. Louis); North Carolina (Durham and Winston);\r\nKentucky (Louisville); New Jersey (Jersey City); Virginia (Richmond) and\r\nOhio (Cincinnati).\r\n\r\nThere are altogether about 400 establishments employing about 20,000\r\npersons, and the value of the product is over 100 million dollars\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThis class of products is by its nature more suitable for concentration of\r\nmanufacture than either cigars or cigarettes. Hence the small number of\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nOnly about 10 million lbs. of manufactured tobacco is exported.\r\n\r\n(_See references end of Chapter XV_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCIGARETTES\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS. KINDS AND WHERE MADE. IMPORTED CIGARETTES. DOMESTIC\r\nCIGARETTES. CIGARETTE PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGARETTES\r\n\r\nA cigarette according to the meaning of the word is a small cigar. It\r\nconsists of a roll of loose tobacco wrapped in a case of either paper or\r\ntobacco-leaf. In the latter case it is known as an all-tobacco cigarette.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of cigarette making machinery the output of\r\ncigarettes in the United States has grown enormously. This will be seen\r\nfrom the following figures which represent the output of cigarettes for\r\nthe past 25 years:\r\n\r\n            Number of cigarettes\r\n  Year      manufactured in the\r\n              United States.\r\n\r\n  1890        2,000,000,000\r\n  1895        3,500,000,000\r\n  1900        4,000,000,000\r\n  1905        6,500,000,000\r\n  1910        7,000,000,000\r\n\r\nThese figures taken from Government Reports are given in round numbers.\r\nThey include \"little cigars\" which form about 15% of the totals. About\r\none-third is at present exported. In addition to the manufactured\r\ncigarettes there is, of course, the large amount of cigarettes made\r\ndirectly by the smoker himself.\r\n\r\nThere are only about 500 establishments in the whole U. S. engaged in\r\ncigarette manufacture and about ten of these manufacture four times as\r\nmany as all the rest together. There would in fact be fewer factories\r\nexcept for the popularity of certain brands of hand-made cigarettes. 95%\r\nof the total output is made in 4 cities, i. e., New York, Durham, N. C.;\r\nRichmond, Va.; and New Orleans. New York City alone manufactures about 60%\r\nof the whole; Richmond about 16%; New Orleans about 10% and Durham the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nEvery country manufactures its own peculiar brand of cigarettes. The best\r\nknown and most popular kinds of cigarettes are those known as Virginian,\r\nTurkish, Havana, Porto Rican, Mexican, Russian and Philippine.\r\n\r\nThe Havana, Porto Rican, Mexican and Philippine cigarettes are usually of\r\nthe all-tobacco kind--the others being paper wrapped. They are generally\r\nmade from the cuttings and smaller leaves of cigar leaf tobacco.\r\n\r\nTurkish cigarettes are celebrated all the world over. The name is however\r\nmostly a misnomer, for nearly all the so-called Turkish cigarettes proper\r\nare made in Egypt, Greece, etc., and not in Turkey. In Egypt, however, the\r\nbest Turkish cigarettes are made from tobacco grown in Turkey (in Europe)\r\nwhich is imported, as no tobacco is grown in Egypt. The peculiar flavor\r\nof Egyptian Turkish cigarettes is due to special methods known only to the\r\nmakers there.\r\n\r\nThe crop of Turkish tobacco, particularly of the better kinds suitable for\r\ncigarettes, is small and less than half of it is exported. The supply of\r\ngenuine Turkish cigarette tobacco is, therefore, strictly limited and does\r\nnot find its way into ordinary channels. Much of so-called \"Turkish\"\r\ntobacco comes from China, and other parts of Asia. From Turkey, in Europe,\r\nthe United States annually imports at present about ten million lbs., the\r\nactual government figures for 1913 being 10,816,048 lbs. valued at about\r\n5-1/2 million dollars.\r\n\r\nFrom Turkey in Asia the imports in 1912 were 11,233,546 lbs., and in 1913,\r\n18,955,295, this latter being valued at nearly 5 million dollars. It does\r\nnot follow that all this latter is Turkish. It was probably in large part\r\ncollected from distant points and shipped from ports in Asia Minor. The\r\nimports of Turkish tobacco during 1914 are considerably reduced on account\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nOne American company which does an immense business in the cigarette line\r\nmaintains at Cavallo a large establishment for the direct purchase and\r\ntreatment of its own Turkish leaf. This plant handles about 6 million\r\nlbs. of leaf annually. The American smoker of home-made Turkish cigarettes\r\nhas the advantage of knowing that his leaf is genuine and bought\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nThe most valued kind of Turkish tobacco is that grown in the Caza of\r\nYenidji on the Vardar River region in Roumelia.\r\n\r\nThe Latakia tobacco grown in the hilly part of Northern Syria is also\r\ncelebrated as a cigarette tobacco. This tobacco has a low nicotine\r\npercentage (less than one per cent) and its peculiar aroma is due to its\r\nexposure for nearly 6 months to the smoke of the tree known as Quercus\r\nIlex. Very choice parcels of these tobaccos fetch in the open market from\r\n$3 to $5 per lb.; lower grades are bought from 25c per lb. and up.\r\n\r\nThe best known grades of cigarettes made from genuine Turkish leaf are the\r\n_La Ferme_ of Leipzig and St. Petersburg; the _Nestor_ and _Melachrino_ of\r\nEgypt; the _Monopol_ of New York; and the _Dubec_ of Richmond. In the\r\nTurkish hand-made cigarette there is no flavoring of any kind. In Europe\r\nthe Turkish cigarettes are usually made by Greeks who are special adepts\r\nat this work.\r\n\r\nThe paper wrappers are imported from France or Austria. The native\r\ncigarette makers as a rule blend their own leaf and cut or shred it by\r\nhand. An expert workman can make about 3,000 cigarettes per day.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, Turkish cigarettes are of two kinds, imported and\r\ndomestic. The imported include those purchased already made from Egypt,\r\nEngland, France, etc. In 1913 the value of cigarettes purchased directly\r\nby the U. S. from Egypt was about $25,000 and from England $22,000, other\r\ncountries less. In 1914 the total cost of imported cigarettes (not\r\nincluding those from Philippine Islands) was $79,554. The value of such\r\ntrade is, therefore, not large. The Turkish cigarettes made in the States\r\nare termed Domestic Turkish, and are usually hand-made, though not by any\r\nmeans exclusively so. It appears to be nothing more than an idiosyncrasy\r\nto consider that a hand-made cigarette is better than a machine-made one.\r\nAs in the case of cigars, other things being equal it would appear that on\r\nmany considerations, hygienic as well as mechanical, the balance is in\r\nfavor of the machine. However, many still think there is some peculiar\r\ntalismanic virtue in a hand-made cigarette and are willing to pay a higher\r\nprice. There is, of course, a pleasure in making one's own cigarettes, but\r\nwhen they are bought made the advantage of hand-making is not very\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThere are many variants of the Turkish cigarette. Besides the common paper\r\nwrapped variety some have fillers of Turkish tobacco with Havana or\r\nVirginia leaf wrapper; others have mixed fillers of Turkish, Virginia,\r\nHavana or Perique, two or more or all kinds being mixed. Each type of\r\ncigarette has its own special votaries. Cigarettes of this variety are\r\nnot, however, so popular in the United States as in other countries where\r\nthe cigarette is the most pronounced type smoked.\r\n\r\nThe American cigarette is generally made of Yellow Virginian tobacco and\r\nis popular all the world over. The secret of success in good cigarette\r\nmaking lies in the selection and blending of the leaf so that the proper\r\nstrength and characteristics may be secured. As a general rule no\r\nadulterants of any kind are added to the tobacco except in some of the\r\nvery cheap kinds in which the leaf is sometimes treated with a glycerine\r\nsolution in order to give it a sweetish taste. The solution is quite\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for the manufacture of cigarettes has been brought to such\r\nperfection that it is quite automatic. The only hand work required is the\r\nfeeding of the tobacco into the hoppers. The cutting, rolling, wrapping,\r\ntipping and packing are all done quite mechanically, the cigarettes being\r\nturned out all ready for the smoker. In the large factories the processes\r\nare under strict hygienic conditions, which is not usually the case in the\r\nsmall workshops where the hand-made goods are prepared. The various\r\nmachines used in the manufacturing processes are highly complicated and a\r\ndetailed description of them would be too technical for these pages.\r\n\r\nThe paper used for wrapping cigarettes has frequently been the subject of\r\nmost unwarranted attacks and the most absurd statements have been made\r\nregarding it. Investigation and analysis of the paper used in the very\r\ncheapest grades of cigarettes by competent authorities have failed to find\r\nanything deleterious to health. The paper used for this purpose is made\r\nprincipally in France. It is of the kind known as rice paper although it\r\nhas no connection whatever with rice. It is a vegetable substance being\r\nmade usually from the membranes of the bread fruit tree or else from fine\r\ntrimmings of flax and hemp. The materials are thoroughly washed and\r\ntreated with lime and soda before and after pulping. Careful analysis are\r\nmade to see that nothing is left that might be harmful and the\r\nmanufacturers use the greatest care and judgment to see that their product\r\nis as pure and perfect as possible as it is their interest that it should\r\nbe so. The paper is extremely thin and light, very combustible, and gives\r\noff very little smoke. These are the only qualities necessary and there is\r\nnot the least reason to use any harmful ingredients, as the required\r\nqualities can be obtained by the ordinary manufacturing processes.\r\nMoreover, the best paper can be manufactured and supplied at a very low\r\ncost. From France the United States annually imports about $500,000 worth\r\nof cigarette paper and from Austria about $120,000 worth.\r\n\r\nMost manufactured cigarettes have a protective tip at the mouth end. This\r\nnot only keeps the cigarette intact but prevents the tobacco from being\r\nwetted by the saliva. As already stated, nicotine is soluble in water, and\r\nits entrance to the mouth in this form is thus obviated. The tips are made\r\nof various substances, cork, straw, goldleaf, cherry wood, etc., in fact\r\nany water-proof substance that is harmless, nonadherent and smooth can be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nCigarettes must according to the law of the U. S. be put up in packages of\r\n5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 50 or 100, and the packages must not contain any lottery\r\nor chance ticket nor any indecent picture.\r\n\r\nMuch criticism, that is to a large extent groundless, has been directed\r\nagainst the habit of cigarette smoking. It has been shown by many\r\ninvestigators that when not carried to excess the cigarette is the safest\r\nmethod of using tobacco. The reader is referred to the remarks regarding\r\ncigarettes in the chapter respecting the effect of tobacco on the human\r\nsystem; but it may be as well here to quote a recent editorial from one of\r\nthe leading representative medical journals of the United States, the\r\nopinion stated in which should go far towards removing the absurd\r\nprejudice against the cigarette.\r\n\r\nFrom the _New York Medical Journal_ of July 25, 1914 (Editorial):\r\n\r\n\"Particularly do the uninformed enjoy an attack on the cigarette; it is\r\ncheap; it is small; and its patrons, numerous as they are, yet form an\r\ninsignificant minority in our immense population. Therefore, the cigarette\r\nand its users are fair game for cheap and silly sneers; sneers which are\r\ncapable, however, of cowing an entire legislature, as in Georgia at this\r\nmoment. Yet, beyond cavil, it has been proved scientifically that of all\r\nmethods of using tobacco, cigarette smoking is the least harmful. Some\r\nmonths ago the _Laucet_ undertook a careful laboratory study of the\r\nvarious ways of consuming tobacco, with the result that it was found that\r\nthe cigarettes, Egyptian, Turkish and American, yielded the least amount\r\nof nicotine to the smoke formed; the cigar came next in point of\r\nharmlessness, while the pipe overshadowed the cigar to the extent that\r\nfrom 70 to 90% of nicotine was said to exist in its smoke.\r\n\r\n\"As to the paper of cigarettes the attacks are simply preposterous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Men are well within their rights in forbidding cigarette smoking and\r\nother pleasures and distractions to their employes; it is another matter\r\nwhen they seize an opportunity to compound with vices they have a mind to,\r\nby damning one they're not inclined to, especially when the latter affords\r\nsolace and recreation to millions perfectly capable of judging what is and\r\nwhat is not good for them. In Europe where a good deal of logical thinking\r\nstill prevails, there is probably not one smoker of distinction in any\r\nwalk of life who does not include the cigarette in his nicotian\r\narmamentarium.\"\r\n\r\n(_See references end of Chapter XV_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSNUFF\r\n\r\nHOW MADE. QUALITIES. DESCRIPTION OF KINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNUFF\r\n\r\nA century ago snuff taking was the principal form in which tobacco was\r\nused. The custom pervaded all classes of society and it was used by both\r\nsexes. The habit has to a very large extent died out; and it is rarely now\r\nthat one sees a snuff box in use. Nevertheless there is still a very large\r\ntrade in snuff manufacture, and it is used very extensively in many\r\ncountries. It will surprise many to know that about 24 million lbs. of\r\nsnuff are manufactured and used annually in the U. S. and that within\r\nrecent years the percentage of increase in the use of this form of tobacco\r\nhas been higher than in the case of cigar, cigarette or pipe smoking\r\nkinds. The value of the snuff manufactured annually is appraised for\r\nrevenue purposes at about 6 million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe process of the manufacture of snuff or tobacco powder, is essentially\r\nbased on long and thorough fermentation as all bitter substances, acid and\r\nessential oils, as well as a large part of the nicotine, must be removed.\r\n\r\nStrong, coarse tobacco is suitable for the purpose, the darker types of\r\nVirginian and Tennessee tobaccos being used. Strong tobacco does not\r\nnecessarily contain a high percentage of nicotine as is usually supposed.\r\nStrength has nothing to do with nicotine content; but whatever amount of\r\nnicotine the tobacco possesses, at least one-half must be removed by\r\nfermentation. As a general rule tobacco leaf which is at least 2 years old\r\nis used and this is submitted to a further fermentation process of a\r\nspecial kind for a period varying from 2 to 6 months. When the\r\nfermentation process is complete, the tobacco, while still in leaf and\r\nunpowdered, is technically known as snuff. There are two principal kinds\r\nof snuff and there are many varieties of each kind principally differing\r\nin flavor and minor qualities.\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of snuff are known as Wet and Dry. These terms are due to\r\nthe difference in the mode of manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn making wet snuff, the tobacco leaves are ground up into grain form\r\n_before_ the fermentation takes place. It only becomes snuff when the\r\nfermentation is completed.\r\n\r\nIn the dry kind the grinding does not take place until _after_ the\r\nfermentation is completed, when the fermented leaves are thoroughly dried.\r\n\r\nThe grinding is then done in a muller similar to a mortar and pestle--this\r\noperation being conducted by machinery on a large scale. After grinding\r\nthe snuff is put through a sieving process and is then sent to the\r\nseasoning department, thus occupying from 2 to 6 months or even longer.\r\n\r\nVarious flavors--attar of roses and such like--are added to give the snuff\r\ndifferent scents and flavors.\r\n\r\nThe various names under which brands of snuff are put up are survivals of\r\nnames applied to snuff made by methods no longer in vogue:\r\n\r\n    SCOTCH SNUFFS are all dry. There are various kinds--strong, plain,\r\n    sweet, salt, high-toast, etc.\r\n\r\n    MACCABOY is a semi-wet snuff.\r\n\r\n    SWEDISH SNUFFS usually contain a large percentage of moisture. The\r\n    grains are coarse and usually highly flavored. Snuff taking is still\r\n    extensive among the Swedish people.\r\n\r\n    RAPPEE is a snuff made after the French fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES (Chapters IX to XV)\r\n\r\nU. S. DEPT. OF COMMERCE.

CARE OF PIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPES\r\n\r\nThe history of tobacco smoking pipes began with the discovery of tobacco\r\nby the Spaniards. How long before that event they were used is not known,\r\nbut that they were used by the Indians and others for a long period is\r\nquite clear from many items of evidence. The reader who desires\r\ninformation concerning pre-Columbian tobacco pipes is referred to the\r\n_Pipes and smoking customs of the American Aborigines_, by J. D. McQuire,\r\nbased on the material in the U. S. National Museum 1889, and other similar\r\narchaological works.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of pipes in literature appears to have been made by\r\nOviedo in 1535 in his work _La historia general de las Indias_ (Part 1).\r\nIn this there is a small wood cut which is the oldest known picture of a\r\npipe. This pipe was shaped like a Y--the two ends of which were placed in\r\nthe nose and the tobacco leaves in the stem. The smoke was inhaled. Oviedo\r\nsays that this pipe was called \"Tabaca\" from which the name tobacco was\r\nprobably derived. Admiral John Hawkins was the first to mention the pipe\r\nin English literature in 1564.\r\n\r\nRaleigh's famous smoking feat did not take place until 1586.\r\n\r\nThe Indian pipes were principally of clay and this material was used in\r\nEngland for the first pipes made there and continued in sole use for about\r\n250 years. From England it came to New England, with the first colonists.\r\nThe Spaniards of South America did not generally use pipes. Meerschaum as\r\na pipe making material was not known in Europe till 1723. It came about in\r\nthis way: There was then in Pesth (Austria-Hungary) an honest old\r\nshoemaker, Karl Kowates, who, when he was not making or mending shoes,\r\nmade pipes. Count Andrassy was one of his pipe patrons. The Count while on\r\na mission to Turkey in 1723 was presented with a lump of meerschaum. The\r\nlightness and porosity of the material suggested to him that it would be a\r\nvery suitable substance for a pipe bowl and on his return to Pesth he\r\nhanded the lump to Karl to make a pipe of it. It seems Karl made two, one\r\nfor the Count and one for himself. But Karl did more than that. The nature\r\nof his shoe work made his hands waxy and he noticed that wherever the pipe\r\nwas waxed by his hands it turned into spots of clear brown color. He thus\r\ndiscovered the coloring qualities of meerschaum. Karl's first pipe is\r\nstill preserved (it is said) at Pesth.\r\n\r\nThe new material became very popular and it spread from Austria all over\r\npipe-smoking Europe.\r\n\r\nWooden pipes do not appear to have come into use till the early part of\r\nthe 19th Century.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of interesting lore concerning early clay pipes into\r\nwhich it is not proposed to enter here. It will be interesting, however,\r\nto note that in William Penn's land transactions with the Indians, 300\r\nclay pipes (probably English make) were one of the articles of barter.\r\n\r\nThe earliest clay pipe stems were about 9 inches long. The long stem pipes\r\nwith glazed ends were introduced about the year 1700 and were known as\r\n\"Aldermen.\" The pipe known as the \"Churchwarden\" with a very long, thin,\r\ncurved stem which was typical of a leisurable smoke did not come into use\r\ntill about 1819. In those days smokers did not commonly carry pipes around\r\nwith them. When a man arrived at an inn or tavern he ordered a pipe and\r\ntobacco, just as he ordered his dinner. The \"Cutty\" or \"Aberdeen\" with the\r\nshort stem was, however, used by those who needed a pocket pipe.\r\n\r\nIt is very surprising how little changes the pipe has undergone. The\r\noriginal pipe was a simple bowl and stem, and the best pipe today is a\r\nplain bowl and stem; for although hundreds of devices and all kinds of\r\npatents have been tried, the true smoker prefers the simple plain pipe\r\nwhich offers no obstacle to the clear drawing of the smoke from the\r\nburning tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe materials used for pipes differ in various countries. Pipes are made\r\nof clay, porcelain, wood, metal, glass, ivory, horn, cane, bamboo, stone,\r\netc. There is no known material which in the opinion of smokers equals\r\ngenuine meerschaum as a material for pipes. This is on account of its\r\nlightness, its coolness, its absorbing qualities and its capabilities of\r\nhigh polish and assumption of a beautiful color when used from soaking the\r\nessential oils of the tobacco. Its friability, however, renders it more\r\nsuitable for use as a home pipe than for a work-a-day pipe.\r\n\r\nFor the work-a-day and knock-about pipe the wooden pipe with short stem is\r\nwithout a rival. The qualities which are essential for a wooden pipe are\r\nmany and it is difficult if not impossible to get any material that will\r\nanswer all of them. The wood for such a pipe must be hard and practically\r\nincombustible, yet light. It must be sapless and inodorous so that when\r\nheated the fragrance of the tobacco would not be mingled with that of the\r\nwood and be lost. In addition it must be a good absorber, cool and have\r\nbeauty of grain and be susceptible of a high polish and must not be\r\nbrittle. The wood known as briar root possesses these qualities to a\r\ngreater extent than any other wood known. It will be described in more\r\ndetail later.\r\n\r\nMyall, a native Austrian wood of a very dark color, hard and of good grain\r\nhas many excellent qualities for pipes, but is brittle.\r\n\r\nMaple, juniper and cherry and several other woods are used to a limited\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEERSCHAUM\r\n\r\nMeerschaum is a light, porous, clayey substance composed of magnesium,\r\noxygen and silicon. It is chemically described as a hydrated silicate of\r\nmagnesia and its chemical formula is MgSi{2}O{4} + 2H{2}O.\r\n\r\nThe word _meerschaum_ is composed of two German words, i. e., Meer, the\r\nsea; and Schaum, foam, and literally means \"the foam of the sea.\" A\r\npopular belief being that the substance was petrified sea foam.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which meerschaum came to be used for smoking pipes\r\nhave already been detailed. Meerschaum occurs as a mineral more or less\r\nscattered all over the world, but the largest quantities and probably the\r\nbest qualities occur in Asia Minor. In the United States, the mineral is\r\nfound in South Carolina. Other mines occur in Spain, Greece and Morocco.\r\nThe principal mines in Asia Minor are situated about 250 miles southwest\r\nof Constantinople, on the plains of Eskishahr. Meerschaum has been in use\r\nfor sundry purposes in the Orient for many centuries and the mines of Asia\r\nMinor have been worked for at least 1,000 years. The result is that they\r\nare now approaching exhaustion. The area in which the mineral occurs\r\nprincipally is small, about six square miles, and in this area many\r\nthousands of pits are worked. The soil is alluvial and in these deposits\r\nthe meerschaum is found in soft lumps and nodules having no definite or\r\nregular shape. It also occurs in veins among the Serpentine rocks and\r\nmarls. Although it is soft when taken out of the ground it rapidly hardens\r\nwhen exposed to the air. It is roughly shaped and cleaned at the mines and\r\nfrom thence sent to the dealers who further prepare it by waxing and\r\npolishing and put it on the market in the conditions in which it reaches\r\nthe pipe makers. The principal European depots for meerschaum are\r\nConstantinople and Vienna. It is usually packed in boxes containing about\r\n50 lbs. each and sells for from 50c to $4.00 per lb.\r\n\r\nThe lumps on reaching the manufacturers are first cut with a band saw into\r\nsuitable sized blocks according to the size and shape of the pipes\r\ndesired. These blocks are then thoroughly soaked in water until they are\r\nthoroughly saturated. The soaking renders the material soft and soapy and\r\ngives it the consistency of cheese, so that it is then easily shaped into\r\nthe desired form which the pipe is to take. It is then dried and hardened\r\nagain and on completion the bowl is hollowed out and the stem drilled. If\r\nthe pipe is a plain one without carving it is finished on a lathe and\r\nfiled ready for polishing. It is also threaded for the mouthpiece. The\r\npipe is then sent to the drying room for such time as is necessary to\r\nexpel all moisture. The final treatment for the smoothing of the surface\r\nis done by fine sandpaper and other special substances, then immersing in\r\nmelted white beeswax for three to five minutes and finally the giving of a\r\nhigh polish with precipitated chalk, cotton and flannel being the usual\r\nrubbing materials used.\r\n\r\nMeerschaum by its nature is particularly adapted for carving. The hand\r\ncarving of such pipes requires artistic and dexterous craftsmen, who are\r\nexperts in this particular class of work.\r\n\r\nThere are various imitations of meerschaum. One is made from burnt gypsum\r\nsoaked with lime in a solution of gum arabic. This forms a hard, creamy\r\nplaster and is capable of receiving a highly smooth and polished\r\nmarble-like surface.\r\n\r\nAnother form of imitation is made of a hardened plaster of Paris highly\r\npolished and tinted in a solution of gamboge and dragon's blood, being\r\nafterwards treated with paraffin or stearic acid. All cheaper grades of\r\nmeerschaum pipes, holders, etc., are made of this or similar compounds and\r\nit is very hard for the average smoker to distinguish them as the ordinary\r\ntests will not suffice. The absorption and coloring qualities are about\r\nthe same. Such imitations cost about half as much as the genuine article\r\nor even sometimes less.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the chips and dust resulting from the working of\r\nthe genuine meerschaum are bonded together with a solution and moulded and\r\nthis is also sold as meerschaum.\r\n\r\nThe number of genuine meerschaum pipes annually manufactured is probably\r\nmuch less than one-half a million, while there are probably three or four\r\ntimes as many imitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIAR ROOT\r\n\r\nAs we have seen briar root is found to be the most suitable wood for pipe\r\nsmoking. The word briar is not named from wild briar. The word is a\r\ncorruption of the French name La Bruyere, meaning the heather shrub of\r\nthat name which grows along the Mediterranean coast of France, Spain and\r\nneighboring countries. It is the root of this shrub which is the substance\r\nused. The shrub is especially cultured for the purpose of pipe making;\r\nbut the area in which the best briar root grows is very limited. It takes\r\nconsiderable time and the result is that the supply of the most suitable\r\nwood is far below the demand. The cultivation of the briar root is a\r\nsimple matter. It consists merely in pruning the growth as much as\r\npossible so as to encourage and strengthen the roots.\r\n\r\nThe very best qualities of briar root come from Corsica and the\r\nneighborhood of Leghorn. It is very finely grained, hard and tough, does\r\nnot char and heats slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown and ready for the market the wood is rough sawn into\r\nblocks, varying in size from 3 inches square up, according to the market\r\nsizes required, and allowed to season. When fully seasoned the blocks are\r\npacked in boxes each containing from 200 to 300 of these blocks. They are\r\nthen sent to the dealers or direct to the pipe factories as the case may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nIn the factory the blocks are sorted and then undergo a sweating process\r\nin steam vats for ten to twelve hours. This steaming gives the wood the\r\nfamiliar brown-yellow tint of the natural briar root uncolored. After\r\nsweating the blocks are sent to the drying room as all traces of moisture\r\nmust be removed. This usually takes several months. For pipe making the\r\nworkman selects his block and roughly trims it to size. It is then placed\r\nin the frazing machine. This usually has three cutters revolving at very\r\nhigh speed, making several thousand revolutions per minute. The center\r\ncutter shapes out the block and the outer knives cut away the wood on the\r\noutside so as to form the block roughly into the shape of a pipe bowl and\r\nstem. This is then placed in a special lathe for cutting irregular forms.\r\nIt is usual to fit in it a metal pattern of the particular shape chosen\r\nfor the pipe. A circular cutting tool is set in motion and the briar\r\nblock, which turns with the metal pattern, is mechanically cut to the\r\nexact shape of the pattern. After cutting, the pipe passes to the\r\nsandpapering machines where both inside and outside are thoroughly\r\ntreated, and it gets a first polishing or smoothing on a pumice stone\r\nwheel. The next process is the boring of the stem which is done in a\r\ndrilling machine by a steel wire having a cutting top rapidly turned by a\r\nlathe. The thread on the end of the stem for the mouthpiece is formed by a\r\nspecial machine. The pipe is then ready for polishers and finishers. It is\r\nfirst sandpapered four times, twice with rough and twice with fine on\r\nrevolving wheels. Unless the wood is to be left its natural color, it is\r\ndropped into a vat of stain until it acquires the color desired. After\r\ndrying it is ready for \"buffing.\" A \"buff\" is a wheel made of many layers\r\nof cloth, leather, etc., which revolves very rapidly. For pipe buffing\r\nthese buffs are usually Tripoli buff, sheepskin buff, muslin and cotton\r\nflannel buff. The Tripoli takes off any sediment held by the edges of the\r\ngrain. The sheepskin buff burns the color fast into the wood. The muslin\r\nand cotton bring out the grain and gives the wood its final delicate\r\nlustre and finish, which are done when the stem and mountings have been\r\nput on. The pipes are then ready for final stamping with name and packing.\r\nThe process is much the same with all other hard woods. Pipe factories are\r\nfound in most countries. French briar pipes are justly celebrated, but the\r\nAmerican pipes are better made.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years calabash has come into vogue to a large extent as a\r\npipe making material. The calabash is a South African squash and has a\r\nspecial softness of flavor. The curved stem end of the calabash is used,\r\nbeing lined with plaster of Paris, and quite a large trade has sprung up\r\nin South Africa in growing calabash for the pipe trade, the principal\r\npoint being Cape Town.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIPE STEM\r\n\r\nIt is very important that suitable material be selected for the mouthpiece\r\nof the pipe. In fact from many points of view the mouthpiece is the most\r\nimportant part of the pipe for the smoker, because damage to the lips must\r\nbe particularly avoided, and a defective, rough, or badly made mouthpiece\r\nis apt to cause damage. There are three very important qualities which the\r\nmaterial must have: (1) It must be hard enough to resist indentation from\r\nthe teeth and yet not feel gritty. (2) It must be capable of receiving a\r\nperfectly smooth surface and of retaining it under the action of saliva.\r\n(3) It must not be a rapid heater so that it will not burn the lips, or\r\ncrack or splinter under action of heat. Other very desirable qualities are\r\ntoughness, beauty of appearance and freedom from taste or odor under all\r\ncircumstances of use.\r\n\r\nAmber has a unique place in fulfilling these conditions. Amber is a fossil\r\ngum or resin, the juice of pine trees, which in course of time has become\r\npetrified like coal.\r\n\r\nAmber is found is various parts of the world, but is more plentifully\r\nfound along the sandy shores of East Prussia bordering on the Baltic Sea.\r\nThis area was in time long past the site of pine forests. The amber is\r\nfound very often to occur with lignite or brown coal. It is dug out of the\r\ncliffs or mined like coal out of the ground. Sometimes it is washed in\r\nfrom the sea. In size it varies from the size of a pea to lumps as large\r\nas an orange. When first dug up it is usually of a pale yellow color, but\r\nthis becomes darker on exposure. The manufacture of commercial amber is a\r\ngovernment monopoly in Prussia. The pieces are all melted down at a\r\ntemperature of about 550 deg. F., and then after purification it is cast into\r\nslabs about 7/8 inch to 1-5/8 inches thick and four inches to eight inches\r\nlong, in which form it is sold to dealers. There are two qualities, opaque\r\nand transparent, the opaque being the tougher. The cost varies\r\nconsiderably, the inferior kinds being sold for $2.00 per pound, and the\r\nfinest specimens cost up to $60.00 per pound.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest quantity of amber used for ordinary pipes is imitation\r\namber. The manufacture of this is a trade secret. It is so good and\r\nfulfills its purpose so well that only experts can distinguish it from\r\ngenuine amber. There are many substitutes for amber.\r\n\r\nGood vulcanite, except for the matter of appearance is little inferior to\r\namber as mouthpiece material. Cut vulcanite is cool and smooth, but\r\nmoulded vulcanite is liable to be rough to the lips and should be avoided.\r\nVulcanite mouthpieces are usually sold already finished direct to the pipe\r\nmakers.\r\n\r\nExcept for the matter of brittleness unglazed clay is a most excellent\r\npipe stem. Clay is usually cool and very absorbent of the acrid oils\r\noccurring in the distillation of tobacco. When the end of a clay stem is\r\nprotected by a rubber band, it forms a very good mouthpiece. Bone and\r\nother materials are also used as mouthpieces. Ebonite is used, but is\r\nobjectionable because it spoils the flavor of the tobacco. Celluloid is a\r\ndangerous substance and should not be used as a pipe stem.\r\n\r\nThe smoker should avoid biting the mouthpiece as it roughens it. It is far\r\nbetter to discard a mouthpiece when it becomes indented, rough or worn in\r\nany way. A damaged mouthpiece should on no account be used when the lips\r\nare chapped or lacerated because the irritation may, if continued, lead to\r\nulceration and tobacco juice is not beneficial to skin lesions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PIPES\r\n\r\nGerman pipes are, as might be expected, the most correct in scientific\r\nprinciple. The pipe has two bowls the upper of which is for the tobacco.\r\nThis fits into a socket which allows the oils and aqueous solutions due to\r\nthe distillation to pass into the lower bowl, very little getting into the\r\nstem. The bowls are usually of porcelain and the long curved stem is of\r\nwood mostly cherry.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch pipe is similar to the German except that the stem is long and\r\nstraight which allows the bowl to rest on the ground. The German pipe is\r\nusually held in the hand by the lower bowl. In Turkey and Oriental\r\ncountries the water pipe is used. This form of pipe originated in Persia.\r\nThe pipe consists of a receptacle for the tobacco, which has a perforated\r\nbottom. This holder fits into a cup from which a hollow tube leads into a\r\njar containing water. The tube passes through the stopper of the jar and\r\ndescends almost to the bottom of the water. Another tube, the inhaling\r\ntube, also passes through the stopper of the jar, but does not reach to\r\nthe surface of the water. On drawing through the inhaler a vacuum is\r\ncreated in the air space above the surface of the water in the jar which\r\ninduces suction through the other tube below the water level. The smoke\r\ntherefore bubbles through the water and is cooled before it reaches the\r\nmouth of the smoker. It, however, requires a considerable amount of effort\r\nto draw the smoke through.\r\n\r\nWater pipes are used extensively among the better classes of the East.\r\nSome of them are very gorgeous affairs, the bowls being of the richest\r\ncrystal and the fittings gold or silver set with gems. Sometimes they have\r\nseveral smoking tubes so as to accommodate more than one smoker. The\r\nwater pipe used by the Shah of Persia is said to be worth $400,000.00.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey the water pipe is known by the name of Hookak. In Egypt it is\r\ncalled Nargeeleh (or Narghile) because the water vessel is usually a cocoa\r\nnut for which the Arabic name is Na'rghee'leh. The Hookak usually stands\r\non the floor and is ponderous, with many smoking tubes. The Nargeeleh is a\r\nhand pipe.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern countries, however, besides the water pipe the ordinary clay\r\nbowl pipe is used to a very large extent, being fitted with a wooden stem\r\nfrom 3 to 5 feet in length. All these pipes are essentially home pipes, as\r\nit is not habitual with the Eastern people to smoke except when seated.\r\n\r\nIn China both sexes commonly smoke pipes--a water pipe made of brass is\r\nusually smoked by the richer classes. The poorer classes use a clay pipe\r\nwith a bamboo stem.\r\n\r\nThe principal importation into the United States of foreign made pipes and\r\nsmokers' articles is from Austria, England and Germany. The latest\r\ngovernment statistics show that from England $278,000, from Austria about\r\n$280,000, and from Germany about $139,000 worth of such goods are annually\r\nimported. These are principally pipes. Cigarette paper, briar root, etc.,\r\nare not included in these figures. The total importation value in 1912\r\n(exclusive of duty) from Europe was $1,478,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF PIPES\r\n\r\nAn experienced smoker lays down the following rules for the care of pipes.\r\nThe rules apply whether a man uses one or half a dozen pipes:\r\n\r\n(1) When a pipe is used for the first time wipe out the bowl with a cloth.\r\nThen thoroughly wet or dampen it. Before the moisture evaporates fill the\r\npipe. Light evenly and be careful not to burn the rim with the lighted\r\nmatch. The tobacco being damp next the wood will not redden there, hence\r\nthe wood will not char but a sooty film will form.\r\n\r\n(2) Ashes should be allowed to remain in the pipe till thoroughly cooled.\r\nThen emptied. The object of this is to allow the liquid residue to soak\r\ninto the pores of the new wood.\r\n\r\n(3) Do not scrape the inner surface of the bowl. The thin coating of\r\ncarbon (the \"cake\") which is formed on it is a nonconductor of heat and\r\nprevents the wood from overheating or cracking. It keeps the pipe cool and\r\nis a good absorber.\r\n\r\n(4) After half a dozen smokes the rule of removing the ashes should be\r\nreversed. They should be removed promptly after smoking. Blow through the\r\nmouthpiece after smoking. By this time the inner surface of bowl is\r\nsufficiently soaked and coated and continuation makes it acrid and sodden.\r\n\r\n(5) Always allow your pipe to cool and dry before resmoking. Use pipe\r\ncleaners and pipe spoon for cleaning. When the \"cake\" becomes too thick\r\npart of it may be removed but always leave a layer next the wood. Be\r\ncareful not to scrape the surface of the bowl.\r\n\r\n(6) A pipe should not be used continuously for more than a few weeks or a\r\nmonth. It should then be cleaned and allowed rest unused for a while. It\r\nis well to allow it to hang where the sunlight can play on it. Acrid\r\nmatters will dry out and the pipe will be sweet when smoked again. It is a\r\ngood plan to pack the bottom of the bowl with powdered chalk when it is\r\nresting.\r\n\r\nWhen a pipe tastes acrid it requires more than ordinary cleaning. If one\r\nhas the opportunity a most excellent way is to blow steam through it,\r\nfirst removing the mouthpiece. Another way recommended by a smoker who\r\nsays it is most efficacious is to fit a cork into the bowl of the pipe.\r\nMake a hole in the cork, into which the nozzle of a soda siphon will fit\r\nsnugly. Direct the mouthpiece into some emptying vessel and force about a\r\nwine glass of the soda water from the siphon through the pipe. It will\r\nclean it out effectively.\r\n\r\nIf you are smoking a meerschaum and desire it to color well and evenly it\r\nis a good plan to use a false upper bowl to fit inside the bowl of your\r\npipe. The rim of fire where the tobacco is burning makes the pipe bowl too\r\nhot and does not allow that part to color. The false bowl will prevent\r\nthis. Some smokers think that covering a meerschaum bowl with chamois will\r\ncause it to color well. The chamois will not aid the coloring but it will\r\nprotect the bowl from being touched by the hand during the process and\r\nthus avoiding a spotty effect, particularly if the hand should be moist or\r\ngreasy. During the progress of the coloring the pipe should never be\r\nallowed to get too hot. The time required to color a pipe depends on the\r\ntobacco used. If it is a rich oily tobacco, the time necessary is shorter\r\nthan with a dry tobacco.\r\n\r\nImitation meerschaum of the cheaper kind are sometimes artificially\r\ncolored by the makers. This is done by boiling the pipe in an oily\r\nsolution of nicotine, the formula for which as given in the _American\r\nDruggist_, V. 58, is:\r\n\r\n  Crude nicotine (oil of tobacco)==[ounce] i.\r\n  Olive oil==[ounce] ii.\r\n  Yellow wax==[ounce] viii.\r\n\r\nThe pipe is kept in the boiling solution from 10 to 15 minutes and rapidly\r\nabsorbs it. The surface is capable of a high polish.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nPENN, W. A. _The Soverane Herbe: a History of Tobacco._ London and New\r\nYork, 1901.\r\n\r\nFAIRHOLT, F.

OPINIONS OF MEDICAL MEN QUOTED AND DISCUSSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF TOBACCO SMOKING ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of very great importance for the user of tobacco that he\r\nshould have clear information regarding the beneficial and harmful effects\r\nof tobacco on the human mind and body. There are very few matters which\r\nhave been the subject of such varied opinions; such exaggeration and\r\nmisconception. Those who are opposed to the use of tobacco have not\r\nhesitated to ascribe to it every form of evil, physical, mental and moral.\r\nInsanity, epilepsy, cancer, malignant throat disease, blindness, heart\r\ndisease and a host of other diseased conditions are traced to tobacco\r\nsmoking by its enemies. On the other hand the users of tobacco are\r\nscarcely less vehement in holding that no harmful effects follow, but\r\nascribing all kinds of virtue as resulting from its use. It is not our\r\nobject in this chapter to justify or recommend the use, or to advise the\r\navoidance of tobacco; we think it is a matter that the individual should\r\ndecide for himself. Moreover, we think that no general rules governing all\r\ncases can be laid down, but that each individual must judge for himself\r\nwhether the use of tobacco is justified in his own particular case or not,\r\ntaking into consideration all the circumstances that affect him. The\r\nimportant thing is that he should possess clear and correct information\r\nwith regard to the effects of tobacco as far as such have been\r\nscientifically determined; and from the observation of its effects on his\r\nown organism to determine whether in his own case the practice is\r\nbeneficial or otherwise and to what extent it may be pursued if he desires\r\nto smoke.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, purpose to submit the facts which have been determined by\r\nthe most careful scientific investigators and others of high standing,\r\nwho, from their experience in the investigation of the causes of disease,\r\nare best qualified to offer opinions which may be accepted as\r\nauthoritative.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the vast amount of literature both for and against the use of\r\ntobacco brings out certain points very largely. First, in the case of the\r\nopponents, the most sweeping statements are made without a particle of\r\nscientific proof in support of them, by persons who are in no way\r\nqualified to make such statements. Statistics are quoted most recklessly\r\nand accepted as conclusive, although in most cases there is no logical\r\nconnection between the matter of the statistics and the absolute effects\r\nof tobacco. If there is a question of a certain condition, it is not\r\nsufficient to show that the person suffering from it was a user of\r\ntobacco and to allege, therefore, that tobacco was the cause of the\r\ncondition. It must be shown conclusively that no other circumstances than\r\nthe use of tobacco could have caused this condition. Dr. T. W. Jenkins, of\r\nAlbany, N. Y., (New York _Medical Journal_, 1915, V. 102, p. 355), who was\r\nawarded a prize by this leading medical journal for his essay on tobacco\r\nsmoking says: \"The first thing to bear in mind is that considering the\r\nlarge amount of tobacco used very little harm results, and care should be\r\ntaken not to incriminate tobacco when the troubles under observation may\r\nbe due to other causes.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, among the investigators themselves who have made impartial\r\ninquiries about the effects of tobacco, there is sometimes a wide\r\ndifference of opinion in the interpretation of results and in the relation\r\nof cause and effect. Thus most varied opinions exist on the subject of\r\nnicotine. The result is that it is difficult for the average man to come\r\nto a satisfactory conclusion on the subject; for it cannot be said that\r\nthe scientific knowledge of the effects of tobacco smoking on the human\r\nsystem as presented to us today is final or sufficiently well determined\r\nto enable definite and true conclusions to be arrived at.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the widespread error of ascribing the evils of the\r\n_abuses_ of tobacco to the _use_ of tobacco. This matter of the _use_ and\r\n_abuse_ of tobacco cannot be put too clearly. Most medical investigators\r\nhave based their results clearly on the _excessive_ use of tobacco. It is\r\na very rare thing to find a medical investigator drawing attention to any\r\nharmful results following the moderate use of tobacco, and it appears a\r\njust statement to make that the majority of men use tobacco in moderation.\r\nIt appears to be true that excessive smoking is harmful and is capable of\r\nproducing deleterious effects on the respiratory and nervous systems in\r\nman, but it has never been scientifically proved that the moderate use of\r\ntobacco has any particularly harmful effects. Moreover, it is well-known\r\nto the medical profession and so stated constantly that in many cases\r\nwhere the use of tobacco has produced bad effects on the eye, nerves,\r\netc., its use is contra-indicated, owing to the condition of the subject\r\ndue to other causes and that such results would not occur in a normally\r\nhealthy subject. Therefore, because tobacco when used excessively or when\r\nused by persons who are not constitutionally fitted for it, produces bad\r\neffects, it is not logical to argue, as many opponents of tobacco smoking\r\ndo, that the use of tobacco is universally harmful.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the conclusions arrived at by some investigators, are based on\r\nexperiments made on animals, and it appears quite open to criticism, and\r\nis in fact disproved by common experience, that such results will follow\r\nwhen applied to man. Hinging on this is the question of immunity and\r\ntoleration. The human system will easily after use tolerate effects which\r\nat first it rebels against. This may easily be seen in muscular and other\r\nefforts. Let a man who is constantly leading a sedentary life suddenly\r\nwalk 10 miles. The result is almost prostration and he will not recover\r\nfrom it for a considerable time. Let him, however, commence by walking a\r\nmile or two and gradually at each walk increase the distance, and in a\r\nshort while he will be able to walk 10 miles without feeling any fatigue.\r\nSimilarly running or other rapid exercise to a person not used to it will\r\nproduce such rapid disturbances in the respiration and circulation as even\r\nto be fatal, while the seasoned athlete may perform such feats without the\r\nleast ill effects.\r\n\r\nTo take animals or persons who have never before used tobacco and to argue\r\nor conclude that the effects of tobacco smoke on them are the effects of\r\ntobacco on smokers generally is absurd. Yet such experimental results are\r\nvery often made the basis of denunciation of tobacco smoking.\r\n\r\nFinally most investigators have made their inquiries for the exclusive\r\npurpose of discovering the evil effects of tobacco smoking. They proceed\r\nto their work with a biassed mind. They have already assumed that the\r\nhabit is harmful and they simply want to find out how much harm they can\r\ndiscover. They are prejudiced from the beginning. It is to this class of\r\ninvestigator that Dr. John Aikman refers to (New York _Medical Journal_,\r\nOct. 30, 1915), when he says: \"In reading the literature on the use of\r\ntobacco we are impressed by the fact that much of it is written by persons\r\ngreatly opposed to the use of the plant, and naturally prejudiced.\" It is\r\nquite conceivable that a man may investigate the evil effects which follow\r\nfrom wearing clothes and shoes and he could undoubtedly find some evil\r\neffects; but the users of such articles could very justly say that the\r\nbeneficial results of such habits more than outweighed the demonstrated\r\nharm that might occur. And then the user of tobacco might say that the\r\nbeneficial effects of smoking more than compensated for any slight harm\r\nthat may happen. For tobacco has undoubtedly many excellent effects, and\r\nno one knows this better than the smoker himself. He will readily admit\r\nthat excess is bad. He will readily admit that the use of tobacco is not\r\nsuitable to immature persons, or in fact to many other persons, but he\r\ninsist that in the majority of cases, it is not only practically harmless\r\nbut that it has many desirable qualities, for that is proved by his own\r\nexperience and the experience of millions of other smokers in all ages and\r\nunder all conditions.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to consider some of the effects which have been\r\nascribed to tobacco smoking and give expressed opinions concerning them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EFFECTS OF TOBACCO SMOKING\r\n\r\nThe principal deleterious effects on the human system ascribed to the use\r\nof tobacco are:\r\n\r\n    (a) Throat diseases.\r\n\r\n    (b) Disturbance of vision.\r\n\r\n    (c) Heart troubles (smokers' heart).\r\n\r\n    (d) Disturbance of the digestive organs (dyspepsia, etc.).\r\n\r\n    (e) Disturbance of the nervous system.\r\n\r\n    (f) Disturbance of nutrition.\r\n\r\nAs regards (a) throat diseases, the following is the opinion of Dr. H.\r\nReik of the Johns Hopkins University, surgeon to the Baltimore Eye, Ear\r\nand Throat Hospital, as expressed by him in the Boston _Medical and\r\nSurgical Journal_, Vol. 162, p. 856, 1910:\r\n\r\n\"There is not one scintilla of evidence that malignant disease of the\r\nthroat is due in any way to the use of tobacco; and if it be admitted that\r\ncarcinoma (cancer) of the lip or tongue has been produced by smoking, it\r\nis clearly _not tobacco_, but traumatism (i. e., injury) from the stems of\r\nthe pipe or other tobacco container that is responsible.\r\n\r\n\"It does not appear or at least has not been proven that tobacco causes\r\nany definite characteristic lesions of the nose, throat or ear.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Reik is a man of high standing in the medical profession. His opinion\r\nis clear and unmistakable and it is presumed he has seen thousands of\r\ncases of nose and throat diseases and knows what he is talking about.\r\n\r\nDr. Reik refers to the question of so-called smokers' cancer. Cancer is a\r\ndisease which attacks all kinds of people and may occur in widely\r\ndifferent parts of the body. The causation of this disease is not known to\r\nthe medical profession but what is known about it is that it usually\r\noccurs on the site of some previous injury. Thus cancer may occur on the\r\ntongue as the result of the constant irritation of a jagged broken tooth.\r\n\r\nDr. I. C. Bloodgood (Boston _Medical and Surgical Journal_, No. 2, 1914),\r\nwho has examined 200 cases of lip cancer says that smoking is a common\r\nfactor, the disease when occurring being usually on the site of a\r\nneglected and ulcerated smoker's burn. The burn may be a charring of the\r\nskin due to a very hot pipe stem or burning cigar stem. He says, moreover,\r\nthat if the burn is not continued and there is no other injury, this\r\ndefect may heal without evidence of ulceration.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a cancer may be the result of continual use of a broken or rough\r\npipe stem or from using a dirty pipe stem on a broken skin. All these are\r\nclearly matters which the average smoker easily and usually avoids. It is,\r\nhowever, clear that tobacco itself is in no way responsible for cancer,\r\nand no responsible medical writer on the subject alleges that it is.\r\n\r\nMost of the medical writers who have inscribed injurious physical effects\r\non the nervous system, heart and sense organs, to excessive tobacco\r\nsmoking have stated that these effects are due to the toxic action of the\r\nalkaloid nicotine known to exist in tobacco. There is a wide difference,\r\nhowever, in the results obtained by different writers as to the amount of\r\nthe nicotine in tobacco which finds its way with the tobacco smoke.\r\nMoreover, some of the investigators who have done very careful work do\r\nnot consider that nicotine is the toxic element, but the substance called\r\npyridine which is derived from it.\r\n\r\nDr. Bush (quoted below) referring to this matter says:\r\n\r\n\"From a review of the literature it would appear that extensive studies\r\nhad been made as to the effects on living organisms of the alkaloid,\r\nnicotine. From such studies a great number of writers, especially laymen,\r\nhave adopted the hasty conclusion that tobacco smoking entailed like\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\"Comparatively few studies have been made of the effects of tobacco\r\nsmoking on human beings; and such as have been made fail to state if the\r\ntobacco used or the smoke produced was examined for nicotine or its\r\ncongeners. The absence of an examination necessarily causes some doubt in\r\nthe causative faction of the phenomena. Some authors are rather inclined\r\nto conclude that nicotine alone is the pathogenic factor in tobacco\r\nsmoking, but since the presence of nicotine _per se_ in tobacco smoke is\r\ndebatable and since other toxic substances are demonstrable, it would seem\r\nas if the whole subject still remained open for investigation.\"\r\n\r\nThe nicotine contained in ordinary tobacco, according to many authors,\r\nranges from about 1 to 8 or 9 per cent. Lee's investigation (_Journal of\r\nPhysiology_, 1908, p. 335) found that about half of the total nicotine was\r\npresent in the smoke--according to Lee the pyridin seemed to be entirely\r\nwithout influence.\r\n\r\nLehmann (_Archiv fuer Hygiene_, 1909, p. 319) found that from 80 to 90% of\r\nthe total nicotine in a cigar or cigarette was to be found in the smoke.\r\nHe found also that in the case of cigars about 10 to 18% of the nicotine\r\nin the smoke is absorbed by the smoker and that cigarette smoke absorbed\r\nby the smoker contains a less proportion of the nicotine in the tobacco\r\nthan is the case with cigars. The general opinion is, however, that about\r\none-seventh of the nicotine in the tobacco will be found in the smoke.\r\n\r\nEntirely at variance with these results are those obtained recently by A.\r\nD. Bush, M.D., Instructor of Physiology in the University of Vermont (New\r\nYork _Medical Journal_, March 14, 1914), and those obtained in the\r\nlaboratory investigation by the London _Laucet_. Bush made long and\r\nextensive investigations on the effects of tobacco smoking and criticised\r\nthe results of previous workers. He shows very clearly that in many cases\r\nthe conclusions drawn by them as regards nicotine contained in tobacco\r\nsmoke are either entirely erroneous or that the deductions made from the\r\ninvestigations were not warranted by the facts observed. He points out\r\nthe fact that most writers on the subject have overlooked the fact of the\r\ngreat discrepancy between the possible effects arising from the\r\nadministration of the amount of nicotine in a cigar and the actual effect\r\nproduced on the smoker of the cigar. He asks this pertinent question: \"If\r\na cigar contains 0.085 grains nicotine, and if one-seventh of the nicotine\r\nof the tobacco is present in the smoke and if but .004 grains is capable\r\nof causing death, why does the smoker not absorb enough nicotine to cause\r\nhis demise?\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of his careful experiments, Bush found that although nicotine\r\nwas present in all the samples of tobacco tested there was no nicotine\r\nwhatever found in the smoke, except in the case of cigarettes and in this\r\ncase only traces were found. The reason of this is given as due to the\r\nrapid burning of the cigarette which did not allow sufficient time for the\r\ncomplete decomposition of the nicotine. Pyridine was, however, found in\r\nthe smoke of all tobacco burned. Pyridine is only one-twentieth as toxic\r\nas nicotine. Bush concluded, therefore, that pyridine and not nicotine is\r\nthe toxic factor in tobacco smoke. The same fact was stated several years\r\nago by Rideal (_Disinfection and Preservation of Food_, London and New\r\nYork, 1903, p. 254), who says: \"Tobacco smoke, contrary to popular\r\nbelief, does not contain nicotine, which is decomposed by the heat; but\r\npyridine and its homologues and the beneficial effects of tobacco in many\r\ncases of asthma must be attributed to this latter.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_ investigation (see _Lancet_, Ap. 6, 1912, pp. 944-947) was\r\nmade because \"a recent review of numerous analysis of tobacco which have\r\nbeen published from time to time raises some doubt as to whether the\r\nresults given correctly represent the actual alkaloidal contents of the\r\ntobacco.\" Moreover, to find the relationship of the true amount of\r\nnicotine in any tobacco to that in the smoke produced by the combustion of\r\nthat tobacco, and any modification caused by the method of smoking.\r\n\r\nThe investigation was conducted under the strictest conditions, the most\r\nrecent methods of chemical research being employed.\r\n\r\nThe following table (given by the _Lancet_) shows the nicotine contents of\r\nvarious tobacco samples and the percentage of nicotine in the smoke:\r\n\r\n  Description of Tobacco.

Egyptian and Turkish\r\ncigarette tobaccos come next (1.38-1.74%). Virginian cigarette tobacco\r\nshows similar figures (1.40-1.60%). French tobacco (Caporal) contains\r\n2.60%, and Perique 5.30%. For all practical purposes the tobaccos consumed\r\nby the public according to this report seldom contain more than 3% of\r\nnicotine and generally less, the average being about 2%, which is much\r\nlower than previous writers lead us to expect.\r\n\r\nThe cigarette, whether Egyptian, Turkish or American, yields the least\r\namount of its total nicotine to the smoke formed, while the pipe yields a\r\nvery large portion (in some cases between 70 and 80%) of its nicotine to\r\nthe smoke. Analysis of cigar smoke gives figures midway between the two.\r\n\r\nWith the results of Bush and the _Lancet_ before him the user of tobacco\r\nwill be better able to judge of the opinions of those who describe the\r\neffects of nicotine on the vision, heart, digestive organs, etc., as\r\nlikely to be the results of tobacco smoking.\r\n\r\nThus the disturbance of vision ascribed to tobacco smoking is called\r\ntobacco amblyopia.\r\n\r\nDr. W. S. Franklin of San Francisco (_Calif. State Jour. of Med._, 1909,\r\nV. 7, p. 85), says that to produce this disease it is necessary to smoke\r\ndaily from .75 to 1.0 gms. of pure nicotine. If 17% of the nicotine of\r\ntobacco is carried in the smoke, in order to absorb that quantity 7 or 8\r\ncheap domestic cigars, 10 or 11 Cubans or 60 cigarettes should be smoked.\r\nNow very few smokers consume this amount and according to Bush, and the\r\n_Lancet_, and others there is no such percentage of nicotine in the smoke.\r\n\r\nTo the use of tobacco is ascribed an acid dyspepsia--this, however, is\r\nnoticed more particularly in habitual chewers and in this case the\r\nnicotine not being burnt has no chance of being decomposed. All writers\r\nhave agreed that chewing is the worst way that tobacco can be used. Dr. R.\r\nV. Dolbey says: (_Northwest Medicine_, 1909, V. 1 p. 99).\r\n\r\n\"In chewing, quantities of watery extract of tobacco are swallowed and\r\ntaken down with the food containing a large percentage of nicotine and\r\ncausing severe dyspepsia. While tobacco juice solution in the laboratory\r\nkills intestinal bacteria, excessive tobacco chewing does not have this\r\neffect on the human body owing to the fact that the gastric and pancreatic\r\njuices act on it and alter it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. I. S. Gilfilian discusses the effects of tobacco on the heart in the\r\nSt. Paul _Medical Journal_, July, 1912, p. 338. He says that the important\r\npart whether organic changes in the cardio-vascular system may be produced\r\nby tobacco is still doubtful, and that it has never been shown that\r\nsmokers suffer more from organic heart disease than nonsmokers.\r\n\r\nGeneral opinion is that smoking lessens the pulse rate and slightly\r\nincreases the blood pressure, and that it is a cause of arterio-sclerosis.\r\n\r\nWith regard to arterio-sclerosis, Dr. A. Lorand of Carlsbad who is a\r\nworld-wide authority on the effects of toxic substances on the blood, says\r\nin his book, _Old Age Deferred_ (English translation, 1910, p. 367):\r\n\r\n\"Clinically we have observed the great frequency of arterio-sclerosis in\r\n_great_ smokers, but we do not think that two or three light cigars a day,\r\nbut never before meals, can do any harm save in exceptional cases. Indeed\r\nthere are a few instances of persons living to be over 100,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that they were smokers--a fact contrary to the\r\nobservation of Hufeland who pretends that he never heard of such a case.\r\nThe famous English painter, Frith, who died in October, 1909, used to\r\nsmoke 6 cigars a day, and Mr. F. of Chartres, in France, passed last year\r\nhis 100th birthday in spite of his having taken snuff all his life.\"\r\n\r\nIf there were any serious lesions caused in the human system by the\r\ncontinued use of tobacco we might naturally expect that life insurance\r\ncompanies would take notice of it, but hear what they have to say\r\n(_Medical Record_, New York, July 12, 1913):\r\n\r\nDr. H. G. Turney, at the meeting of Life Insurance Medical Officers\r\nAssociation, London, January, 1913, said that as far as observation and\r\nstudy of the literature went he did not consider that there was much\r\nevidence that the habit of smoking can be convicted of any serious effect\r\non the mortality table. One must confess rather to a feeling of surprise\r\nthat the life-long absorption of so potent a drug as nicotine by a large\r\nproportion of the male population should not be accompanied by more\r\nobvious results in the way of serious injury to the cardiac muscle than\r\nappears to be the case.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Marvin of the Department of Pharmacology, Vermont University, made\r\nnumerous experiments on the effects produced by tobacco. In the cases of\r\nthe respiratory system, he states that in rapid smoking the respiratory\r\nrate is increased, due more to the effort than to the drug. In deliberate\r\nsmoking there is very little effect. In the digestive system the effects\r\nproduced were, increased flow of saliva and stimulation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach and intestines. Marvin did not find any important\r\nsymptoms of systemic irregularities except where there was excessive use\r\nof tobacco. He says: \"Tobacco produces, _when used to excess_, symptoms in\r\na very small per cent and often it is only one factor in producing the\r\nconditions observed.\" A very cautiously expressed and noncommittal\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that of the percentage of nicotine in tobacco smoke\r\nonly a small portion is drawn into the smoker's system. The greater part\r\npasses off again in the smoke passed out; also that the products of\r\ncombustion of tobacco include acqueous solution as well as smoke; it will\r\nnot probably be questioned that some of this watery solution is drawn into\r\nthe mouth as well as the smoke and probably contains minute quantities of\r\nnicotine or its derivatives.\r\n\r\nThe smoker may obviate any slight harmful effects of these substances by\r\ncare. If he is a cigar smoker he must avoid chewing or sucking the butt\r\nend of the cigar in which the acqueous solution finally gathers, and he\r\nwould find it better to smoke long thin cigars which afford a small area\r\nbehind the burning point for the collection of acqueous vapor and give a\r\nbetter combustion. Judged from these viewpoints the best and most\r\nexpensive thick cigar is likely to be more harmful than the very worst\r\nkind of a cigarette, for although there may be a much smaller percentage\r\nof nicotine in the cigar tobacco, a much larger proportion of it may reach\r\nthe mouth of the smoker through the water produced by combustion, in the\r\ncase of the cigar than in the case of the cigarette.\r\n\r\nEvery cigar and cigarette smoker should use a holder for the reason\r\nstated. The cigarette from the nicotine point of view is the least\r\nobjectionable form of smoking. In fact expert opinion is recognizing that\r\nunless where the smoke is inhaled cigarette smoking if not excessive is\r\nprobably harmless. It is hard, of course, to kill a popular prejudice,\r\nbut we have to deal with demonstrated facts not prejudices. In the case of\r\ninhalation of cigarette smoke the danger is from carbon monoxide gas and\r\nnot from nicotine.\r\n\r\nWhen the difference of opinion amongst authoritative investigators are\r\ndiscounted their general results will be found to agree very well with the\r\ngeneral facts observed by all users of tobacco. What they see is that\r\nprobably seventy per cent of the adult male population under all\r\nconditions and circumstances use tobacco within limits of moderation. They\r\nsee around them men who have for many years used it, and they do not\r\nobserve any particular harmful results in the user of tobacco compared\r\nwith the nonuser. Men as a rule are not more nervous, more subject to\r\nheart troubles or age troubles than women, who as a sex, do not use\r\ntobacco. Smokers do not deny and never have denied that the abuse of\r\ntobacco is harmful.\r\n\r\nThe general view that both scientific investigators and popular\r\nobservation is able to support is well expressed by Clouston, who is a\r\nworld known authority on nervous and mental disease. (See _Hygiene of\r\nMind_, 3rd Ed. London, 1906, p. 260.)\r\n\r\n\"If its use is restricted to full grown men, if only good tobacco is used\r\nnot of too great strength, and if it is not used to excess, then there\r\nare no scientific proofs that it has any injurious effects, if there is no\r\nidiosyncracy against it.... Speaking generally, it exercises a soothing\r\ninfluence when the nervous system is in any way irritable. It tends to\r\ncalm and continuous thinking and in many men promotes the digestion of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\"Tobacco, properly used may, in some cases, undoubtedly be made a mental\r\nhygienie.\"\r\n\r\nMann (_Brit. Med. Journal_, 1908, V. II, p. 1673), expresses a similar\r\nopinion thus: \"Most men if they choose to smoke can do so within certain\r\nlimits without injury to health. Some men can exceed such limits with\r\napparent impunity. The extent of the limitation must be determined by each\r\nman for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nITS DISINFECTING ACTION. PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASE.\r\nPSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SMOKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BENEFICIAL QUALITIES OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters the possible harmful effects of using tobacco\r\nhave been dealt with at length. In this chapter we shall deal shortly with\r\nsome positive beneficial effects.\r\n\r\nThere is very little doubt that tobacco is a strongly protective agent\r\nagainst infection from disease. Its germicidal qualities are well-known\r\nand recognized. It is now recognized by medical writers that the mouth is\r\none of the principal, if not the principal channel of infection for many\r\ninfective diseases. The cavities of the teeth are the breeding places of\r\nhosts of pathogenic bacteria, of which there are about 100 different\r\nvarieties arising from decaying food and other sources. These destructive\r\nagents, many of them highly pathogenic, easily find their way from the\r\nmouth through various channels to the inside of the body. Many infective\r\norganisms floating in the air are drawn into the mouth in the act of\r\nrespiration and this is a common method of falling a victim to contagion.\r\n\r\nThe effect of tobacco juice on the bacteria of the human mouth was\r\ninvestigated by Dr. W. D. Fullerton and is reported by him in the\r\n_Cleveland Med. Journal_ 1912, page 585.\r\n\r\nIn his experiments Fullerton used tobacco juice obtained from the human\r\nmouth by chewing plug tobacco. He also used a solution of smoke obtained\r\nfrom a well seasoned pipe. These were first thoroughly sterilized in order\r\nto obtain a pure natural mixture of tobacco and saliva. Cultures of\r\nwell-known species of bacteria were made using every laboratory precaution\r\nso as to obtain accurate results. Specimens of these bacterial cultures\r\nwere then submitted to the action of the tobacco juice. It was found that\r\nexposure for one hour killed or rendered innocuous 15 to 98 per cent of\r\nthe bacteria; exposure for 24 hours acted similarly on from 84 to 100%.\r\nDr. Fullerton gives his opinion, from his results, that it seems that a\r\npipeful of tobacco was more toxic to bacteria than one chew; but chewing\r\ntends to loosen retained food particles, foci of bacteria, etc., and much\r\nof this is ejected from the mouth. Fullerton's work agreed very well with\r\nthe results obtained by other workers in the same line of investigation.\r\nIn Miller's _Micro-organisms of the Human Mouth_, p. 246, it is stated\r\nthat the organisms of the mouth lead only a miserable existence in a\r\nmixture of an infusion of tobacco, sugar and saliva; and that the smoke of\r\nthe last one-third or the first one-fourth of a Colorado Claro cigar\r\nsterilized ten cubic centimeters of beef extract solution which had been\r\nrichly inoculated with bacteria from decayed teeth. Arnold, _Lancet_\r\n(London, 1907) reports similar experiences with some of the most virulent\r\ntypes of infective bacteria.\r\n\r\nBoth nicotine and its derivative pyridine as well as the tarry oils\r\nresulting from tobacco distillation are strong and effective\r\ndisinfectants; and formaldehyde, one of the most powerful germicides\r\nknown, is so formed. Trillat, _Annales de l'Institut Pasteur_ (Paris),\r\nVol. 19, p. 722, shows that 100 grams of pipe tobacco will yield .063\r\ngrams and 100 grams weight of cigar .118 grams of formaldehyde. Also that\r\na dilution of 1/1000 formaldehyde is germicidal to all bacteria although\r\nit has very little deleterious effects on man.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be ascertained there has not been very much investigation\r\nfor the purpose of demonstrating the actual results of clinical experience\r\nregarding the antiseptic qualities of tobacco in the case of smokers, but\r\nfacts, so far as they have been recorded, bear out the experiments. Rideal\r\n_Disinfection and Preservation of Food_ (London and New York, 1903) states\r\nthat the investigations of Tessarini showed that tobacco smoke passed over\r\nthe organisms of human cholera and pneumonia killed them in from 10 to 30\r\nminutes. He also states that the Cigar Manufacturers Association of\r\nHamburg reported that in the cholera epidemic of 1892 in that city, only 8\r\nout of 5,000 employes in the cigar factories there were attacked by the\r\ndisease and that, there were only 4 deaths. Professor Wenck, of the\r\nImperial Institute of Berlin, has published an account of this cholera\r\nepidemic (see _Laucett francaise_, Paris, 1912, p. 1425). His conclusions\r\nfavor the preservative action of tobacco. It was clearly shown that\r\nslightly moist tobacco was a fatal germicide for the cholera bacillus; all\r\nmicrobes die in it in 24 hours. The examination of cigars made in Hamburg\r\nduring the epidemic showed that they were absolutely free from bacilli.\r\nWenck asserts also that cholera microbes die in 1/2 hour, 1 hour, and 2\r\nhours after having been placed in contact with the smoke of Brazilian,\r\nSumatran and Havana tobacco. The fumes of tobacco will besides kill in\r\nfive minutes the cholera microbes obtained from saliva. Fullerton already\r\nquoted examined a small number of mouths (74) in the Johns Hopkins\r\nHospital at Baltimore. Of those who did not use tobacco in any form a\r\nlarger percentage showed signs of dental caries and decay of an advanced\r\nstage than in the case of tobacco users. Similarly in the case of women\r\nwho never used tobacco; and, although there was a much greater care and\r\ncleansing of the teeth, yet the percentage of decay and disease was higher\r\nthan in the case of men using tobacco. Fullerton says, \"The smoking or\r\nchewing of tobacco is decidedly germicidal. Chewing, by exercising the\r\nteeth, helps nutrition and eliminates pathological agencies both by\r\ndestroying them _in situ_ and by removing them in the expectoration.\"\r\nRideal (already quoted) mentions that Dr. Burney, the senior medical\r\nofficer of Greenwich Hospital, London, asserts that the tobacco smoking\r\ninmates of that institution enjoyed comparative immunity from epidemics.\r\n\r\nFrom these opinions and examples it seems quite clear that whatever\r\nportions of the decomposition products of tobacco reach the mouth and mix\r\nwith the saliva, or propagate themselves in the immediate surroundings of\r\nthe smoker, are likely to have extremely good effects. It would be easy to\r\nmultiply these opinions but there is no use laboring the argument. There\r\nis a matter, however, it will do no harm to mention here. Today it is\r\nbeing gradually recognized by the medical profession that the conditions\r\nwhich lead ultimately to gastric and intestinal ulcer including\r\nappendicitis are entirely due to infection. At the 1912 meeting of the\r\nBritish Medical Association this was clearly manifested and some of the\r\nleading authorities in England pointed out the importance of the mouth as\r\na focus of infection in such diseases. Now if this is so, it is at once\r\napparent how important tobacco as a mouth disinfectant and germicide\r\nbecomes; and it may incidentally throw some light (otherwise unexplained)\r\non the fact constantly observed that in persons under 30 years old these\r\ndiseases are far more common amongst women than in the case of men. The\r\nuse of tobacco is not asserted as a reason, but it may be.\r\n\r\nWith regard to other beneficial effects--Clouston, Fullerton and Marvin,\r\nstate that the moderate use of tobacco has a beneficial effect on the\r\ndigestive system as in general it causes an increased flow of saliva and\r\ngastric juice which helps in the digestion of food; it also stimulates the\r\nmuscles and mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. The sedative\r\neffects of tobacco on the nerves is a preventative of nervous dyspepsia\r\nand is valuable for the promotion of good digestion.\r\n\r\nWhile much has been written on the effects of excessive smoking on the\r\nnervous system little has been said of the good effects of moderate\r\nsmoking. Every smoker realizes that the soothing effects of tobacco on the\r\nnerves is perhaps its most valuable property. Clouston's opinion, already\r\nquoted (and none could be better), is that \"tobacco exercises a soothing\r\ninfluence when the nervous system is in anyway irritable; it tends to calm\r\nand continuous thinking.\" Fullerton says, \"It gives a composure and\r\nfeeling of well-being which are beneficial to mind and body.\" Of these\r\nfacts there can be no doubt because they are matters of common daily\r\nobservation and experience. Most smokers find a solace and quieting\r\ninfluence from their evening smoke after the worries of a troublesome day\r\nwhich no other agent can give them. The effect produced may be partly\r\npsychological but that does not matter. Indeed the strenuousness of life\r\nin the age in which we live seems to demand such a help and nothing\r\nappears to supply the want so efficiently, so pleasantly, and with less\r\nharm, than a quiet smoke. It puts the smoker at peace with himself and at\r\npeace with others. Bush found in his investigations on the mental effects\r\nof tobacco on college students that there was a temporary loss of ten per\r\ncent in mental efficiency in certain faculties of the mind. This is\r\nprobably true enough though his results are not quite conclusive. On the\r\nother hand many men find that they can think more clearly and more\r\nconsecutively when helped by a smoke. Indeed they smoke when they have a\r\nknotty problem to solve. The point need not be argued; all smokers will\r\nagree with it.\r\n\r\nJudged from a psychological standpoint the effects of tobacco are entirely\r\nfavorable. To the sleepless, the worried, to him who is troubled in mind\r\nor vexed in spirit, the pipe or cigar is a never-failing remedy to soothe\r\nand cheer. It is the feeling of betterment which it engenders and the\r\nspirit of good will which tobacco creates that are responsible for its\r\nuniversal use by men differing widely in grade and condition of life as\r\nwell as in mental caliber; it reaches the common springs which move\r\nhumanity; its qualities are those which have made the pipe a symbol of\r\npeace and a bond of fellowship and union between man and man from Pole to\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nFrom a general summing up of the opinions which have been quoted the\r\nquestion might finally be asked, \"Is tobacco on the whole harmful or\r\nbeneficial to its users?\" The answer seems to be this: \"Tobacco to the\r\nextent used on the average has some slight injurious effects and some\r\nslight beneficial effects on the physical system. It is an excellent\r\npreservative agent against contagious and infectious disease. Mentally its\r\neffects are overwhelmingly beneficial.\" In every particular case a man\r\nmust judge for himself, taking account of his individual idiosyncrasies\r\nand conditions whether the use of tobacco is beneficial to him or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n_Laucet._ London, 1906.

But increase in taxation, either\r\ninternal revenue or tariff, usually occasions a diminution in consumption\r\nas it invariably increases the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF TOBACCO DUE TO INSECT PESTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nTobacco, from the seed bed to the storage of the manufactured products, is\r\nsubject to attack by insects, etc., and vigilance must at all times be\r\nexercised to keep it free from such harmful influences.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the principal agencies attacking tobacco will be mentioned\r\nhere as the subject is of more interest to the specialist than to the\r\nsmoker. The growing plant is particularly subject to Cut-worm disease and\r\nHorn-worm disease. _Cut-worms_ are the larvae of several species of moths.\r\nThey injure the young, tender plant and feed on the leaves. _Horn-worms_\r\nare the larvae of the Sphinx Moth. 2 or 3 will ruin a plant in one day.\r\n\r\nStored tobacco is subject to many diseases. _Bud caterpillars_, the\r\n_leaf-miner_ or _split-worm_ and the _Tobacco flea beetle_ are minute\r\nbeetles which attack it. _Mosaic disease_, _Frog-eye_ or _Leaf-spot_ are\r\nprobably bacterial diseases.\r\n\r\nIn addition, tobacco, particularly during the curing process, is subject\r\nto pole-burn, pole-sweat, or house-burn, stem-rot, white-vein, and various\r\nforms of mould, all these being probably due to bacteria.\r\n\r\nFor additional information see:\r\n\r\n    U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE. _Farmers' Bulletin_, 120.\r\n\r\n    HOWARD, L. O. _The principal insects affecting the tobacco plant._\r\n    Washington, D. C., 1900.\r\n\r\n    U. S. DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE. _Bureau of Entomology._ Bulletin 65.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECKLED OR SPOTTED CIGARS\r\n\r\nMany smokers of cigars have the idea that there is some special virtue in\r\na cigar that shows specks or spots of discoloration in the leaf. As a\r\nmatter of fact such spots have nothing whatever to do with the quality of\r\nthe tobacco. The occurrence of such spots is accounted for differently.\r\nSome say the spots are due to certain bacteria which attack the leaf\r\neither when growing or fermenting and this most probably is the correct\r\nview. Others say that the spots are due to rain drops which, sprinkled on\r\nthe leaves, act as lenses and concentrate the rays of the sun, thus\r\ncausing a burning of the leaf in such spots. Some think the spots are\r\ncaused by a worm. On account of the prejudice of smokers for speckled\r\ncigars dealers have been known to produce this appearance in the leaf\r\nartificially. There are different methods although resort is not often had\r\nat the present time to this practice as the belief in this sign is no\r\nlonger as prevalent as formerly. The following are examples of such cigar\r\nspeckling preparation, the chief ingredient being some active oxidizing\r\nagent:\r\n\r\nCigar speckling fluid:\r\n\r\n(Method 1.) Powdered Ammonium Carbonate and a concentrated solution of\r\n(H{2}O{2}).\r\n\r\nDissolve one part of the Ammonium Carbonate in 25 parts of the\r\n(H{2}O{2}). Touch the cigar with this in spots with the end of a pointed\r\nstick. This gives the appearance of speckled Sumatran leaf.\r\n\r\n(Method 2.) The following method is said to be used by a large firm:\r\n\r\n  Sodium Carbonate--3 parts.\r\n  Chlorinated Lime--1 part.\r\n  Hot Water--8 parts.\r\n\r\nDissolve the washing soda in the hot water, add the chlorinated lime, and\r\nheat to the boiling point. When cool decant and cork tightly. This is\r\nsprinkled over the tobacco.--From _American Druggist_, Vol. 83, p. 328.\r\n\r\nSpecks are sometimes caused by fluids used to destroy insects which attack\r\nthe cigar after manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO FLAVORING ESSENCES\r\n\r\nIn the chapter treating of the manufacture of smoking and chewing tobacco\r\nit was stated that the tobacco leaf was often treated by certain flavoring\r\nessences. The following are quoted as examples of such essences:\r\n\r\n  Cascarilla Bark--1 ounce.\r\n  Fluid Extract Valerian--1 ounce.\r\n  Tonka Bean--2 drams.\r\n  English Rum--3 ounces.\r\n\r\n  --From _Pharmaceutical Era_, V. 21, 1899, p. 252.\r\n\r\nThe following essences are said to be used in France and Germany:\r\n\r\n(1) For every 1,000 kilos. of tobacco take 4 kilos. of purified potash; 5\r\nkilos. table salt; 10 kilos. canella water; 10 kilos. rose water; 5 kilos.\r\nmelilotte water; 2.8 grams tonka bean; pulverized. Color the whole with 4\r\ngrams English red.

Vanilla--1/2 gal.\r\n  Alcohol and Jamaica Rum,--each, 1/2 gal.\r\n  Tinct. Valerian--8 ounces.\r\n  Carraway Seed--2 ounces.\r\n  English Valerian Root--2 ounces.\r\n  Bitter Orange Peel--2 ounces.\r\n  Tonka Bean--4 drams.\r\n  Myrrh--16 ounces.\r\n\r\n_Formula 2._\r\n\r\n  Valerianic Acid--3 drams.\r\n  Acetic Ether--40 minims.\r\n  Butyric Ether--10 minims.\r\n  Alcohol--4 pints.\r\n\r\n_Formula 3._\r\n\r\n  Fluid Extr. Valerian--1 ounce.\r\n  Tinct. Tonka Bean--8 ounces.\r\n  Alcohol--enough to make 16 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMULA TO IMPROVE THE BURNING QUALITIES OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\n  2 lbs. of Saltpeter.\r\n  Half gallon of Alcohol (100% proof).\r\n  1 gallon Port Wine.\r\n  9 gallons Lukewarm Water.\r\n\r\nMix these ingredients thoroughly together, and add to every 100 lbs.\r\nweight of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERCOMING DESIRE FOR TOBACCO\r\n\r\n(From _The American Druggist_, V. 51, 1908.)\r\n\r\nKalometzer (Bulletin Medical, 1907) states that rinsing mouth with\r\nsolution of silver nitrate (1/4 of 1% strength) will overcome the desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTING INJURIOUS ACTION OF NICOTINE\r\n\r\nA process for the treatment of tobacco leaves preventing in a way\r\ninjurious action of nicotine and of acrid empyreumatic acid products, was\r\ndevised some years ago by Professor Gerold of Halle. His process is thus\r\ndescribed: He employs for 8 kilograms of tobacco leaves containing the\r\nusual percentage of nicotine a decoction prepared by boiling 15 grams of\r\ntannic acid with 1-1/2 kilograms of water until the weight is reduced to\r\none kilogram; then 30 grams of the essential oil of origanum vulgare are\r\nadded, after which the decoction is immediately removed from the fire.\r\nHaving stood for some minutes the mixture is filtered and allowed to cool\r\nto about 16 deg. C., when the preparation is ready to be spread over the\r\npreviously weighed tobacco. When the absorption of this mixture by the\r\ntobacco leaves is completed, they are subjected to slight pressure and\r\nmoderate heat, after which they are ready for the manufacture of the\r\nvarious tobacco products.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTannic acid is a well-known antidote for nicotine poisoning, and it is\r\nclaimed for Gerold's process that while the undistilled nicotine is\r\nneutralized in its toxic qualities only by the tannic acid, that this does\r\nnot influence at all its peculiar odor nor most of its other\r\ncharacteristics.--From the _Pharmaceutical Era_, July 27, 1899, p. 144.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHavana cigars are generally better if smoked fresh; domestic cigars are\r\nbetter if allowed to age in the box several months before using.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRemember that the phosphorus or sulphur of a match may spoil the flavor of\r\na fine cigar. Be careful when you are lighting it to use only the edge of\r\nthe match flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the total number of cigars smoked annually in the United States were\r\nplaced end to end they would encircle the whole world more than twenty\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Air Curing of Leaf, 66\r\n\r\n  Amber, 162\r\n\r\n  American Production of Tobacco Other Than in U.
