In fact autosuggestion is an\r\ninstrument that we possess at birth, and in this instrument, or rather\r\nin this force, resides a marvelous and incalculable power, which\r\naccording to circumstances produces the best or the worst results.\r\nKnowledge of this force is useful to each one of us, but it is\r\npeculiarly indispensable to doctors, magistrates, lawyers, and to\r\nthose engaged in the work of education.\r\n\r\nBy knowing how to practise it _consciously_ it is possible in the\r\nfirst place to avoid provoking in others bad autosuggestions which\r\nmay have disastrous consequences, and secondly, consciously to\r\nprovoke good ones instead, thus bringing physical health to the sick,\r\nand moral health to the neurotic and the erring, the unconscious\r\nvictims of anterior autosuggestions, and to guide into the right path\r\nthose who had a tendency to take the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSCIOUS SELF AND THE UNCONSCIOUS SELF\r\n\r\nIn order to understand properly the phenomena of suggestion, or to\r\nspeak more correctly of autosuggestion, it is necessary to know that\r\ntwo absolutely distinct selves exist within us. Both are intelligent,\r\nbut while one is conscious the other is unconscious. For this reason\r\nthe existence of the latter generally escapes notice. It is however\r\neasy to prove its existence if one merely takes the trouble to\r\nexamine certain phenomena and to reflect a few moments upon\r\nthem. Let us take for instance the following examples:\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of somnambulism; every one knows that a\r\nsomnambulist gets up at night _without waking_, leaves his room\r\nafter either dressing himself or not, goes downstairs, walks along\r\ncorridors, and after having executed certain acts or accomplished\r\ncertain work, returns to his room, goes to bed again, and shows next\r\nday the greatest astonishment at finding work finished which he had\r\nleft unfinished the day before.\r\n\r\nIt is however he himself who has done it without being aware of it.\r\nWhat force has his body obeyed if it is not an unconscious force, in\r\nfact his unconscious self?\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the alas, too frequent case of a drunkard\r\nattacked by _delirium tremens_. As though seized with madness he\r\npicks up the nearest weapon, knife, hammer, or hatchet, as the case\r\nmay be, and strikes furiously those who are unlucky enough to be in\r\nhis vicinity. Once the attack is over, he recovers his senses and\r\ncontemplates with horror the scene of carnage around him, without\r\nrealizing that he himself is the author of it. Here again is it not the\r\nunconscious self which has caused the unhappy man to act in this\r\nway? [*]\r\n\r\n[*] And what aversions, what ills we create for ourselves, everyone\r\nof us and in every domain by not \"immediately\" bringing into play\r\n\"good conscious autosuggestions\" against our \"bad unconscious\r\nautosuggestions,\" thus bringing about the disappearance of all unjust\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the conscious with the unconscious self we see that\r\nthe conscious self is often possessed of a very unreliable memory\r\nwhile the unconscious self on the contrary is provided with a\r\nmarvelous and impeccable memory which registers without our\r\nknowledge the smallest events, the least important acts of our\r\nexistence. Further, it is credulous and accepts with unreasoning\r\ndocility what it is told. Thus, as it is the unconscious that is\r\nresponsible for the functioning of all our organs but the intermediary\r\nof the brain, a result is produced which may seem rather paradoxical\r\nto you: that is, if it believes that a certain organ functions well or ill\r\nor that we feel such and such an impression, the organ in question\r\ndoes indeed function well or ill, or we do feel that impression.\r\n\r\nNot only does the unconscious self preside over the functions of our\r\norganism, but also over _all our actions whatever they are_. It is\r\nthis that we call imagination, and it is this which, contrary to\r\naccepted opinion, _always_ makes us act even, and _above all_,\r\nagainst _our will_ when there is antagonism between these two\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL AND IMAGINATION\r\n\r\nIf we open a dictionary and look up the word \"will\", we find this\r\ndefinition: \"The faculty of freely determining certain acts\". We\r\naccept this definition as true and unattackable, although nothing\r\ncould be more false. This will that we claim so proudly, always\r\n_yields_ to the imagination. It is an _absolute_ rule that admits of no\r\n_exception_.\r\n\r\n\"Blasphemy! Paradox!\" you will exclaim. \"Not at all! On the\r\ncontrary, it is the purest truth,\" I shall reply.\r\n\r\nIn order to convince yourself of it, open your eyes, look round you\r\nand try to understand what you see. You will then come to the\r\nconclusion that what I tell you is not an idle theory, offspring of a\r\nsick brain but the simple expression of a _fact_.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we place on the ground a plank 30 feet long by 1 foot\r\nwide. It is evident that everybody will be capable of going from one\r\nend to the other of this plank without stepping over the edge. But\r\nnow change the conditions of the experiment, and imagine this plank\r\nplaced at the height of the towers of a cathedral. Who then will be\r\ncapable of advancing even a few feet along this narrow path? Could\r\nyou hear me speak? Probably not. Before you had taken two steps\r\nyou would begin to tremble, and _in spite of every effort of your\r\nwill_ you would be certain to fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhy is it then that you would not fall if the plank is on the ground,\r\nand why should you fall if it is raised to a height above the ground?\r\nSimply because in the first case you imagine that it is easy to go to\r\nthe end of this plank, while in the second case you _imagine_ that\r\nyou _cannot_ do so.\r\n\r\nNotice that your will is powerless to make you advance; if you\r\n_imagine_ that you _cannot_, it is _absolutely_ impossible for you\r\nto do so. If tilers and carpenters are able to accomplish this feat, it is\r\nbecause they think they can do it.\r\n\r\nVertigo is entirely caused by the picture we make in our minds that\r\nwe are going to fall. This picture transforms itself immediately into\r\nfact _in spite of all the efforts of our will_, and the more violent\r\nthese efforts are, the quicker is the opposite to the desired result\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the case of a person suffering from insomnia. If\r\nhe does not make any effort to sleep, he will lie quietly in bed. If on\r\nthe contrary he tries to force himself to sleep by his _will_, the\r\nmore efforts he makes, the more restless he becomes.\r\n\r\nHave you not noticed that the more you try to remember the name of\r\na person which you have forgotten, the more it eludes you, until,\r\nsubstituting in your mind the idea \"I shall remember in a minute\" to\r\nthe idea \"I have forgotten\", the name comes back to you of its own\r\naccord without the least effort?\r\n\r\nLet those of you who are cyclists remember the days when you were\r\nlearning to ride. You went along clutching the handle bars and\r\nfrightened of falling. Suddenly catching sight of the smallest\r\nobstacle in the road you tried to avoid it, and the more efforts you\r\nmade to do so, the more surely you rushed upon it.\r\n\r\nWho has not suffered from an attack of uncontrollable laughter,\r\nwhich bursts out more violently the more one tries to control it?\r\n\r\nWhat was the state of mind of each person in these different\r\ncircumstances? \"_I do not want_ to fall but I _cannot help_ doing\r\nso\"; \"I _want_ to sleep but I _cannot_ \"; \"I _want_ to remember the\r\nname of Mrs. So and So, but I _cannot_ \"; \"I _want_ to avoid the\r\nobstacle, but I _cannot_ \"; \"I _want_ to stop laughing, but I\r\n_cannot_.\"\r\n\r\nAs you see, in each of these conflicts it is always the _imagination_\r\nwhich gains the victory over the _will_, without any exception.\r\n\r\nTo the same order of ideas belongs the case of the leader who rushes\r\nforward at the head of his troops and always carries them along with\r\nhim, while the cry \"Each man for himself!\" is almost certain to\r\ncause a defeat. Why is this? It is because in the first case the men\r\n_imagine_ that they must go _forward_, and in the second they\r\n_imagine_ that they are conquered and must fly for their lives.\r\n\r\nPanurge was quite aware of the contagion of example, that is to say\r\nthe action of the imagination, when, to avenge himself upon a\r\nmerchant on board the same boat, he bought his biggest sheep and\r\nthrew it into the sea, certain beforehand that the entire flock would\r\nfollow, which indeed happened.\r\n\r\nWe human beings have a certain resemblance to sheep, and\r\ninvoluntarily, we are irresistibly impelled to follow other people's\r\nexamples, _imagining_ that we cannot do otherwise.\r\n\r\nI could quote a thousand other examples but I should fear to bore\r\nyou by such an enumeration. I cannot however pass by in silence\r\nthis fact which shows the enormous power of the imagination, or in\r\nother words of the unconscious in its struggle against the _will_.\r\n\r\nThere are certain drunkards who wish to give up drinking, but who\r\ncannot do so. Ask them, and they will reply in all sincerity that they\r\ndesire to be sober, that drink disgusts them, but that they are\r\nirresistibly impelled to drink against their _will_, in spite of the\r\nharm they know it will do them.\r\n\r\nIn the same way certain criminals commit crimes _in spite of\r\nthemselves_, and when they are asked why they acted so, they\r\nanswer \"I could not help it, something impelled me, it was stronger\r\nthan I.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the drunkard and the criminal speak the truth; they are forced to\r\ndo what they do, for the simple reason they imagine they cannot\r\nprevent themselves from doing so. Thus we who are so proud of our\r\nwill, who believe that we are free to act as we like, are in reality\r\nnothing but wretched puppets of which our imagination holds all the\r\nstrings. We only cease to be puppets when we have learned to guide\r\nour imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION AND AUTOSUGGESTION\r\n\r\nAccording to the preceding remarks we can compare the\r\nimagination to a torrent which fatally sweeps away the poor wretch\r\nwho has fallen into it, in spite of his efforts to gain the bank. This\r\ntorrent seems indomitable; but if you know how, you can turn it\r\nfrom its course and conduct it to the factory, and there you can\r\ntransform its force into movement, heat, and electricity.\r\n\r\nIf this simile is not enough, we may compare the imagination--\"the\r\nmadman at home\" as it has been called--to an unbroken horse which\r\nhas neither bridle nor reins. What can the rider do except let himself\r\ngo wherever the horse wishes to take him? And often if the latter\r\nruns away, his mad career only comes to end in the ditch. If however\r\nthe rider succeeds in putting a bridle on the horse, the parts are\r\nreversed. It is no longer the horse who goes where he likes, it is the\r\nrider who obliges the horse to take him wherever he wishes to go.\r\n\r\nNow that we have learned to realize the enormous power of the\r\nunconscious or imaginative being, I am going to show how this self,\r\nhitherto considered indomitable, can be as easily controlled as a\r\ntorrent or an unbroken horse. But before going any further it is\r\nnecessary to define carefully two words that are often used without\r\nbeing properly understood. These are the words _suggestion_ and\r\n_autosuggestion_.\r\n\r\nWhat then is suggestion? It may be defined as \"the act of imposing\r\nan idea on the brain of another\". Does this action really exist?\r\nProperly speaking, no. Suggestion does not indeed exist by itself. It\r\ndoes not and cannot exist except on the _sine qua non_ condition of\r\ntransforming itself into _autosuggestion_ in the subject. This latter\r\nword may be defined as \"the implanting of an idea in oneself by\r\noneself.\"\r\n\r\nYou may make a suggestion to someone; if the unconscious of the\r\nlatter does not accept the suggestion, if it has not, as it were,\r\ndigested it, in order to transform it into _autosuggestion_, it\r\nproduces no result. I have myself occasionally made a more or less\r\ncommonplace suggestion to ordinarily very obedient subjects quite\r\nunsuccessfully. The reason is that the unconscious of the subject\r\nrefused to accept it and did not transform it into _autosuggestion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF AUTOSUGGESTION\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the point where I said that we can control and\r\nlead our imagination, just as a torrent or an unbroken horse can be\r\ncontrolled. To do so, it is enough in the first place to know that this\r\nis possible (of which fact almost everyone is ignorant) and secondly,\r\nto know by what means it can be done. Well, the means is very\r\nsimple; it is that which we have used every day since we came into\r\nthe world, without wishing or knowing it and absolutely\r\nunconsciously, but which unfortunately for us, we often use wrongly\r\nand to our own detriment. This means is _autosuggestion_.\r\n\r\nWhereas we constantly give ourselves unconscious autosuggestions,\r\nall we have to do is to give ourselves conscious ones, and the\r\nprocess consists in this: first, to weigh carefully in one's mind the\r\nthings which are to be the object of the autosuggestion, and\r\naccording as they require the answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to repeat several\r\ntimes without thinking of anything else: \"This thing is coming\", or\r\n\"this thing is going away\"; \"this thing will, or will not happen, etc.,\r\netc. . . .\" [*] If the unconscious accepts this suggestion and\r\ntransforms it into an autosuggestion, the thing or things are realized\r\nin every particular.\r\n\r\n[*] Of course the thing must be in our power.\r\n\r\nThus understood, _autosuggestion_ is nothing but hypnotism as I\r\nsee it, and I would define it in these simple words: _The influence of\r\nthe imagination upon the moral and physical being of mankind_.\r\nNow this influence is undeniable, and without returning to previous\r\nexamples, I will quote a few others.\r\n\r\nIf you persuade yourself that you can do a certain thing, provided\r\nthis thing be _possible_, you will do it however difficult it may be.\r\nIf on the contrary you _imagine_ that you cannot do the simplest\r\nthing in the world, it is impossible for you to do it, and molehills\r\nbecome for you unscalable mountains.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case of neurasthenics, who, believing themselves\r\nincapable of the least effort, often find it impossible even to walk a\r\nfew steps without being exhausted. And these same neurasthenics\r\nsink more deeply into their depression, the more efforts they make\r\nto throw it off, like the poor wretch in the quicksands who sinks in\r\nall the deeper the more he tries to struggle out.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it is sufficient to think a pain is going, to feel it\r\nindeed disappear little by little, and inversely, it is enough to think\r\nthat one suffers in order to feel the pain begin to come immediately.\r\n\r\nI know certain people who predict in advance that they will have a\r\nsick headache on a certain day, in certain circumstances, and on that\r\nday, in the given circumstances, sure enough, they feel it. They\r\nbrought their illness on themselves, just as others cure theirs by\r\n_conscious autosuggestion_.\r\n\r\nI know that one generally passes for mad in the eyes of the world if\r\none dares to put forward ideas which it is not accustomed to hear.\r\nWell, at the risk of being thought so, I say that if certain people are\r\nill mentally and physically, it is that they _imagine_ themselves to\r\nbe ill mentally or physically. If certain others are paralytic without\r\nhaving any lesion to account for it, it is that they _imagine_\r\nthemselves to be paralyzed, and it is among such persons that the\r\nmost extraordinary cures are produced. If others again are happy or\r\nunhappy, it is that they imagine themselves to be so, for it is possible\r\nfor two people in exactly the same circumstances to be, the one\r\n_perfectly happy_, the other _absolutely wretched_.\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia, stammering, aversions, kleptomania, certain cases of\r\nparalysis, are nothing but the result of unconscious autosuggestion,\r\nthat is to say the result of the action of the _unconscious_ upon the\r\nphysical and moral being.\r\n\r\nBut if our unconscious is the source of many of our ills, it can also\r\nbring about the cure of our physical and mental ailments. It can not\r\nonly repair the ill it has done, but cure real illnesses, so strong is its\r\naction upon our organism.\r\n\r\nShut yourself up alone in a room, seat yourself in an armchair, close\r\nyour eyes to avoid any distraction, and concentrate your mind for a\r\nfew moments on thinking: \"Such and such a thing is going to\r\ndisappear\", or \"Such and such a thing is coming to pass.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have really made the autosuggestion, that is to say, if your\r\nunconscious has assimilated the idea that you have presented to it,\r\nyou are astonished to see the thing you have thought come to pass.\r\n(Note that it is the property of ideas autosuggested to exist within us\r\nunrecognized, and we can only know of their existence by the effect\r\nthey produce.) But above all, and this is an essential point, the will\r\nmust not be brought into play in practising autosuggestion; for, if it\r\nis not in agreement with the imagination, if one thinks: \"I will make\r\nsuch and such a thing happen\", and the imagination says: \"You are\r\nwilling it, but it is not going to be\", not only does one not obtain\r\nwhat one wants, but even exactly the reverse is brought about.\r\n\r\nThis remark is of capital importance, and explains why results are so\r\nunsatisfactory when, in treating moral ailments, one strives to\r\n_re-educate_ the will. It is the _training of the imagination_ which is\r\nnecessary, and it is thanks to this shade of difference that my method\r\nhas often succeeded where others--and those not the least\r\nconsidered--have failed. From the numerous experiments that I have\r\nmade daily for twenty years, and which I have examined with\r\nminute care, I have been able to deduct the following conclusions\r\nwhich I have summed up as laws:\r\n\r\n1. When the will and the imagination are antagonistic, it is always\r\nthe imagination which wins, _without any exception_.\r\n\r\n2. In the conflict between the will and the imagination, the force of\r\nthe imagination is in _direct ratio to the square of the will_.\r\n\r\n3. When the will and the imagination are in agreement, one does not\r\nadd to the other, but one is multiplied by the other.\r\n\r\n4. The imagination can be directed.\r\n\r\n(The expressions \"In direct ratio to the square of the will\" and \"Is\r\nmultiplied by\" are not rigorously exact. They are simply illustrations\r\ndestined to make my meaning clearer.)\r\n\r\nAfter what has just been said it would seem that nobody ought to be\r\nill. That is quite true. Every illness, whatever it may be, _can_ yield\r\nto _autosuggestion_, daring and unlikely as my statement may seem;\r\nI do not say _does always yield_, but _can yield_, which is a\r\ndifferent thing.\r\n\r\nBut in order to lead people to practise conscious autosuggestion they\r\nmust be taught how, just as they are taught to read or write or play\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\n_Autosuggestion_ is, as I said above, an instrument that we possess\r\nat birth, and with which we play unconsciously all our life, as a baby\r\nplays with its rattle. It is however a dangerous instrument; it can\r\nwound or even kill you if you handle it imprudently and\r\nunconsciously. It can on the contrary save your life when you know\r\nhow to employ it _consciously_. One can say of it as Aesop said of\r\nthe tongue: \"It is at the same time the best and the worst thing in the\r\nworld\".\r\n\r\nI am now going to show you how everyone can profit by the\r\nbeneficent action of _autosuggestion_ consciously applied. In saying\r\n\"every one\", I exaggerate a little, for there are two classes of persons\r\nin whom it is difficult to arouse conscious autosuggestion:\r\n\r\n1. The mentally undeveloped who are not capable of understanding\r\nwhat you say to them.\r\n\r\n2. _Those who are unwilling to understand_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO TEACH PATIENTS TO MAKE AUTOSUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\nThe principle of the method may be summed up in these few words:\r\n_It is impossible to think of two things at once_, that is to say that\r\ntwo ideas may be in juxtaposition, but they cannot be superimposed\r\nin our mind.\r\n\r\n_Every thought entirely filling our mind becomes true for us and\r\ntends to transform itself into action_.\r\n\r\nThus if you can make a sick person think that her trouble is getting\r\nbetter, it will disappear; if you succeed in making a kleptomaniac\r\nthink that he will not steal any more, he will cease to steal, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis training which perhaps seems to you an impossibility, is,\r\nhowever, the simplest thing in the world. It is enough, by a series of\r\nappropriate and graduated experiments, to teach the subject, as it\r\nwere the A. B. C. of conscious thought, and here is the series: by\r\nfollowing it to the letter one can be absolutely sure of obtaining a\r\ngood result, except with the two categories of persons mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n_First experiment_.[*] _Preparatory_.--Ask the subject to stand\r\nupright, with the body as stiff as an iron bar, the feet close together\r\nfrom toe to heel, while keeping the ankles flexible as if they were\r\nhinges. Tell him to make himself like a plank with hinges at its base,\r\nwhich is balanced on the ground. Make him notice that if one pushes\r\nthe plank slightly either way it falls as a mass without any resistance,\r\nin the direction in which it is pushed. Tell him that you are going to\r\npull him back by the shoulders and that he must let himself fall in\r\nyour arms without the slightest resistance, turning on his ankles as\r\non hinges, that is to say keeping the feet fixed to the ground. Then\r\npull him back by the shoulders and if the experiment does not\r\nsucceed, repeat it until it does, or nearly so.\r\n\r\n[*] These experiments are those of Sage of Rochester.\r\n\r\n_Second experiment_.--Begin by explaining to the subject that in\r\norder to demonstrate the action of the imagination upon us, you are\r\ngoing to ask him in a moment to think: \"I am falling backwards, I\r\nam falling backwards. . . .\" Tell him that he must have no thought but\r\nthis in his mind, that he must not reflect or wonder if he is going to\r\nfall or not, or think that if he falls he may hurt himself, etc., or fall\r\nback purposely to please you, but that if he really feels something\r\nimpelling him to fall backwards, he must not resist but obey the\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nThen ask your subject to raise the head high and to shut his eyes,\r\nand place your right fist on the back of his neck, and your left hand\r\non his forehead, and say to him: \"Now think: I am falling backwards,\r\nI am falling backwards, etc., etc. . .\" and, indeed, \"You are falling\r\nbackwards, You . . . are . . . fall . . . ing . . . back . . . wards,\r\netc.\" At the same time slide the left hand lightly backwards to the\r\nleft temple, above the ear, and remove very slowly but with a\r\ncontinuous movement the right fist.\r\n\r\nThe subject is immediately felt to make a slight movement\r\nbackwards, and either to stop himself from falling or else to fall\r\ncompletely. In the first case, tell him that he has resisted, and that he\r\ndid not think just that he was falling, but that he might hurt himself\r\nif he did fall. That is true, for if he had not thought the latter, he\r\nwould have fallen like a block. Repeat the experiment using a tone\r\nof command as if you would force the subject to obey you. Go on\r\nwith it until it is completely successful or very nearly so. The\r\noperator should stand a little behind the subject, the left leg forward\r\nand the right leg well behind him, so as not to be knocked over by\r\nthe subject when he falls. Neglect of this precaution might result in a\r\ndouble fall if the person is heavy.\r\n\r\n_Third experiment_.--Place the subject facing you, the body still\r\nstiff, the ankles flexible, and the feet joined and parallel. Put your\r\ntwo hands on his temples without any pressure, look fixedly,\r\nwithout moving the eyelids, at the root of his nose, and tell him to\r\nthink: \"I am falling forward, I am falling forward . . .\" and repeat to\r\nhim, stressing the syllables, \"You are fall . . . ing . . . for . . . ward,\r\nYou are fall . . . ing . . . for . . . ward . . .\" without ceasing to look\r\nfixedly at him.\r\n\r\n_Fourth experiment_.--Ask the subject to clasp his hands as tight as\r\npossible, that is to say, until the fingers tremble slightly, look at him\r\nin the same way as in the preceding experiment and keep your hands\r\non his as though to squeeze them together still more tightly. Tell him\r\nto think that he cannot unclasp his fingers, that you are going to\r\ncount three, and that when you say \"three\" he is to try to separate his\r\nhands while thinking all the time: \"I cannot do it, I cannot do it . . .\"\r\nand he will find it impossible. Then count very slowly, \"one, two,\r\nthree\", and add immediately, detaching the syllables: \"You . . .\r\ncan . . . not . . . do . . . it. . . . You . . . can . . . not . . .\r\ndo . . . it. . . .\" If the subject is thinking properly, \"I cannot do\r\nit\", not only is he unable to separate his fingers, but the latter\r\nclasp themselves all the more tightly together the more efforts he makes\r\nto separate them. He obtains in fact exactly the contrary to what he\r\nwants. In a few moments say to him: \"Now think: 'I can do it,'\" and\r\nhis fingers will separate themselves.\r\n\r\nBe careful always to keep your eyes fixed on the root of the subject's\r\nnose, and do not allow him to turn his eyes away from yours for a\r\nsingle moment. If he is able to unclasp his hands, do not think it is\r\nyour own fault, it is the subject's, he has not properly thought: \"I\r\ncannot\". Assure him firmly of this, and begin the experiment again.\r\n\r\nAlways use a tone of command which suffers no disobedience. I do\r\nnot mean that it is necessary to raise your voice; on the contrary it is\r\npreferable to employ the ordinary pitch, but stress every word in a\r\ndry and imperative tone.\r\n\r\nWhen these experiments have been successful, all the others succeed\r\nequally well and can be easily obtained by carrying out to the letter\r\nthe instructions given above.\r\n\r\nSome subjects are very sensitive, and it is easy to recognize them by\r\nthe fact that the contraction of their fingers and limbs is easily\r\nproduced. After two or three successful experiments, it is no longer\r\nnecessary to say to them: \"Think this\", or \"think that\"; You need\r\nonly, for example, say to them simply--but in the imperative tone\r\nemployed by all good suggestionists--\"Close your hands; now you\r\ncannot open them\". \"Shut your eyes; now you cannot open them,\"\r\nand the subject finds it absolutely impossible to open the hands or\r\nthe eyes in spite of all his efforts. Tell him in a few moments: \"You\r\ncan do it now,\" and the de-contraction takes place instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThese experiments can be varied to infinity. Here are a few more:\r\nMake the subject join his hands, and suggest that they are welded\r\ntogether; make him put his hand on the table, and suggest that it is\r\nstuck to it; tell him that he is fixed to his chair and cannot rise; make\r\nhim rise, and tell him he cannot walk; put a penholder on the table\r\nand tell him that it weighs a hundredweight, and that he cannot lift it,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn all these experiments, I cannot repeat too often, it is not\r\n_suggestion_ properly so-called which produces the phenomena, but\r\nthe _autosuggestion_ which is consecutive to the suggestion of the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF PROCEDURE IN CURATIVE SUGGESTION\r\n\r\nWhen the subject has passed through the preceding experiments and\r\nhas understood them, he is ripe for curative suggestion. He is like a\r\ncultivated field in which the seed can germinate and develop,\r\nwhereas before it was but rough earth in which it would have\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nWhatever ailment the subject suffers from, whether it is physical or\r\nmental, it is important to proceed always in the same way, and to use\r\nthe same words with a few variations according to the case.\r\n\r\nSay to the subject: Sit down and close your eyes. I am not going to\r\ntry and put you to sleep as it is quite unnecessary. I ask you to close\r\nyour eyes simply in order that your attention may not be distracted\r\nby the objects around you. Now tell yourself that every word I say is\r\ngoing to fix itself in your mind, and be printed, engraved, and\r\nencrusted in it, that, there, it is going to stay fixed, imprinted, and\r\nencrusted, and that without your will or knowledge, in fact perfectly\r\nunconsciously on your part, you yourself and your whole organism\r\nare going to obey. In the first place I say that every day, three times\r\na day, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening, at the usual\r\nmeal times, you will feel hungry, that is to say, you will experience\r\nthe agreeable sensation which makes you think and say: \"Oh! how\r\nnice it will be to have something to eat!\" You will then eat and enjoy\r\nyour food, without of course overeating. You will also be careful to\r\nmasticate it properly so as to transform it into a sort of soft paste\r\nbefore swallowing it. In these conditions you will digest it properly,\r\nand so feel no discomfort, inconvenience, or pain of any kind either\r\nin the stomach or intestines. You will assimilate what you eat and\r\nyour organism will make use of it to make blood, muscle, strength\r\nand energy, in a word: Life.\r\n\r\nSince you will have digested your food properly, the function of\r\nexcretion will be normal, and every morning, on rising, you will feel\r\nthe need of evacuating the bowels, and without ever being obliged to\r\ntake medicine or to use any artifice, you will obtain a normal and\r\nsatisfactory result.\r\n\r\nFurther, every night from the time you wish to go to sleep till the\r\ntime you wish to wake next morning, you will sleep deeply, calmly,\r\nand quietly, without nightmares, and on waking you will feel\r\nperfectly well, cheerful, and active.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you occasionally suffer from depression, if you are\r\ngloomy and prone to worry and look on the dark side of things, from\r\nnow onwards you will cease to do so, and, instead of worrying and\r\nbeing depressed and looking on the dark side of things, you are\r\ngoing to feel perfectly cheerful, possibly without any special reason\r\nfor it, just as you used to feel depressed for no particular reason. I\r\nsay further still, that even if you have real reason to be worried and\r\ndepressed you are not going to be so.\r\n\r\nIf you are also subject to occasional fits of impatience or ill-temper\r\nyou will cease to have them: on the contrary you will be always\r\npatient and master of yourself, and the things which worried,\r\nannoyed, or irritated you, will henceforth leave you absolutely\r\nindifferent and perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nIf you are sometimes attacked, pursued, haunted, by bad and\r\nunwholesome ideas, by apprehensions, fears, aversions, temptations,\r\nor grudges against other people, all that will be gradually lost sight\r\nof by your imagination, and will melt away and lose itself as though\r\nin a distant cloud where it will finally disappear completely. As a\r\ndream vanishes when we wake, so will all these vain images\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nTo this I add that all your organs are performing their functions\r\nproperly. The heart beats in a normal way and the circulation of the\r\nblood takes place as it should; the lungs are carrying out their\r\nfunctions, as also the stomach, the intestines, the liver, the biliary\r\nduct, the kidneys and the bladder. If at the present moment any of\r\nthem is acting abnormally, that abnormality is becoming less every\r\nday, so that quite soon it will have vanished completely, and the\r\norgan will have recovered its normal function. Further, if there\r\nshould be any lesions in any of these organs, they will get better\r\nfrom day to day and will soon be entirely healed. (With regard to\r\nthis, I may say that it is not necessary to know which organ is\r\naffected for it to be cured. Under the influence of the autosuggestion\r\n\"Every day, in every respect, I am getting better and better\", the\r\nunconscious acts upon the organ which it can pick out itself.)\r\n\r\nI must also add--and it is extremely important--that if up to the\r\npresent you have lacked confidence in yourself, I tell you that this\r\nself-distrust will disappear little by little and give place to\r\nself-confidence, based on the knowledge of this force of incalculable\r\npower which is in each one of us. It is absolutely necessary for every\r\nhuman being to have this confidence. Without it one can accomplish\r\nnothing, with it one can accomplish whatever one likes, (within\r\nreason, of course). You are then going to have confidence in\r\nyourself, and this confidence gives you the assurance that you are\r\ncapable of accomplishing perfectly well whatever you wish to do,\r\n--_on condition that it is reasonable_,--and whatever it is your duty to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nSo when you wish to do something reasonable, or when you have a\r\nduty to perform, always think that it is _easy_, and make the words\r\n_difficult, impossible, I cannot, it is stronger than I, I cannot prevent\r\nmyself from_. . . , disappear from your vocabulary; they are not\r\nEnglish. What is English is: \"_It is easy and I can_ \". By considering\r\nthe thing easy it becomes so for you, although it might seem difficult\r\nto others. You will do it quickly and well, and without fatigue,\r\nbecause you do it without effort, whereas if you had considered it as\r\ndifficult or impossible it would have become so for you, simply\r\nbecause you would have thought it so.\r\n\r\nTo these general suggestions which will perhaps seem long and even\r\nchildish to some of you, but which are necessary, must be added\r\nthose which apply to the particular case of the patient you are\r\ndealing with.\r\n\r\nAll these suggestions must be made in a monotonous and soothing\r\nvoice (always emphasizing the essential words), which although it\r\ndoes not actually send the subject to sleep, at least makes him feel\r\ndrowsy, and think of nothing in particular.\r\n\r\nWhen you have come to the end of the series of suggestions you\r\naddress the subject in these terms: \"In short, I mean that from every\r\npoint of view, physical as well as mental, you are going to enjoy\r\nexcellent health, better health than that you have been able to enjoy\r\nup to the present. Now I am going to count three, and when I say\r\n'Three', you will open your eyes and come out of the passive state\r\nin which you are now. You will come out of it quite naturally,\r\nwithout feeling in the least drowsy or tired, on the contrary, you will\r\nfeel strong, vigorous, alert, active, full of life; further still, you will\r\nfeel very cheerful and fit in every way. 'ONE--TWO--THREE--' At\r\nthe word 'three' the subject opens his eyes, always with a smile and\r\nan expression of well-being and contentment on his face.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes,--though rarely,--the patient is cured on the spot; at other\r\ntimes, and this is more generally the case, he finds himself relieved,\r\nhis pain or his depression has partially or totally disappeared, though\r\nonly for a certain lapse of time.\r\n\r\nIn every case it is necessary to renew the suggestions more or less\r\nfrequently according to your subject, being careful always to space\r\nthem out at longer and longer intervals, according to the progress\r\nobtained until they are no longer necessary,--that is to say when the\r\ncure is complete.\r\n\r\nBefore sending away your patient, you must tell him that he carries\r\nwithin him the instrument by which he can cure himself, and that\r\nyou are, as it were, only a professor teaching him to use this\r\ninstrument, and that he must help you in your task. Thus, every\r\nmorning before rising, and every night on getting into bed, he must\r\nshut his eyes and in thought transport himself into your presence,\r\nand then repeat twenty times consecutively in a monotonous voice,\r\ncounting by means of a string with twenty knots in it, this little\r\nphrase:\r\n\r\n\"EVERY DAY, IN EVERY RESPECT, I AM GETTING BETTER\r\nAND BETTER.\" In his mind he should emphasize the words \"_in\r\nevery respect_\" which applies to every need, mental or physical.\r\nThis general suggestion is more efficacious than special ones.\r\n\r\nThus it is easy to realize the part played by the giver of the\r\nsuggestions. He is not a master who gives orders, but a friend, a\r\nguide, who leads the patient step by step on the road to health. As all\r\nthe suggestions are given in the interest of the patient, the\r\nunconscious of the latter asks nothing better than to assimilate them\r\nand transform them into autosuggestions. When this has been done,\r\nthe cure is obtained more or less rapidly according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIORITY OF THIS METHOD\r\n\r\nThis method gives absolutely marvelous results, and it is easy to\r\nunderstand why. Indeed, by following out my advice, it is\r\nimpossible to fail, except with the two classes of persons mentioned\r\nabove, who fortunately represent barely 3 per cent of the whole. If,\r\nhowever, you try to put your subjects to sleep right away, without\r\nthe explanations and preliminary experiments necessary to bring\r\nthem to accept the suggestions and to transform them into\r\nautosuggestions you cannot and will not succeed except with\r\npeculiarly sensitive subjects, and these are rare. Everybody may\r\nbecome so by training, but very few are so sufficiently without the\r\npreliminary instruction that I recommend, which can be done in a\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\nFormerly, imagining that suggestions could only be given during\r\nsleep, I always tried to put my patient to sleep; but on discovering\r\nthat it was not indispensable, I left off doing it in order to spare him\r\nthe dread and uneasiness he almost always experiences when he is\r\ntold that he is going to be sent to sleep, and which often makes him\r\noffer, in spite of himself, an involuntary resistance. If, on the\r\ncontrary, you tell him that you are not going to put him to sleep as\r\nthere is no need to do so, you gain his confidence. He listens to you\r\nwithout fear or any ulterior thought, and it often happens--if not the\r\nfirst time, anyhow very soon--that, soothed by the monotonous\r\nsound of your voice, he falls into a deep sleep from which he\r\nawakes astonished at having slept at all.\r\n\r\nIf there are sceptics among you--as I am quite sure there are--all I\r\nhave to say to them is: \"Come to my house and see what is being\r\ndone, and you will be convinced by fact.\"\r\n\r\nYou must not however run away with the idea that autosuggestion\r\ncan only be brought about in the way I have described. It is possible\r\nto make suggestions to people without their knowledge and without\r\nany preparation. For instance, if a doctor who by his title alone has a\r\nsuggestive influence on his patient, tells him that he can do nothing\r\nfor him, and that his illness is incurable, he provokes in the mind of\r\nthe latter an autosuggestion which may have the most disastrous\r\nconsequences; if however he tells him that his illness is a serious\r\none, it is true, but that with care, time, and patience, he can be cured,\r\nhe sometimes and even often obtains results which will surprise him.\r\n\r\nHere is another example: if a doctor after examining his patient,\r\nwrites a prescription and gives it to him without any comment, the\r\nremedies prescribed will not have much chance of succeeding; if, on\r\nthe other hand, he explains to his patient that such and such\r\nmedicines must be taken in such and such conditions and that they\r\nwill produce certain results, those results are practically certain to be\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nIf in this hall there are medical men or brother chemists, I hope they\r\nwill not think me their enemy. I am on the contrary their best friend.\r\nOn the one hand I should like to see the theoretical and practical\r\nstudy of suggestion on the syllabus of the medical schools for the\r\ngreat benefit of the sick and of the doctors themselves; and on the\r\nother hand, in my opinion, every time that a patient goes to see his\r\ndoctor, the latter should order him one or even several medicines,\r\neven if they are not necessary. As a matter of fact, when a patient\r\nvisits his doctor, it is in order to be told what medicine will cure him.\r\nHe does not realize that it is the hygiene and regimen which do this,\r\nand he attaches little importance to them. It is a medicine that he\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if the doctor only prescribes a regimen without any\r\nmedicine, his patient will be dissatisfied; he will say that he took the\r\ntrouble to consult him for nothing, and often goes to another doctor.\r\nIt seems to me then that the doctor should always prescribe\r\nmedicines to his patient, and, as much as possible, medicines made\r\nup by himself rather than the standard remedies so much advertised\r\nand which owe their only value to the advertisement. The doctor's\r\nown prescriptions will inspire infinitely more confidence than So\r\nand So's pills which anyone can procure easily at the nearest drug\r\nstore without any need of a prescription.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SUGGESTION WORKS\r\n\r\nIn order to understand properly the part played by suggestion or\r\nrather by autosuggestion, it is enough to know that the _unconscious\r\nself is the grand director of all our functions_. Make this believed,\r\nas I said above, that a certain organ which does not function well\r\nmust perform its function, and instantly the order is transmitted. The\r\norgan obeys with docility, and either at once or little by little\r\nperforms its functions in a normal manner. This explains simply and\r\nclearly how by means of suggestion one can stop haemorrhages,\r\ncure constipation, cause fibrous tumours to disappear, cure paralysis,\r\ntubercular lesions, varicose, ulcers, etc.\r\n\r\nLet us take for example, a case of dental haemorrhage which I had\r\nthe opportunity of observing in the consulting room of M. Gauthé, a\r\ndentist at Troyes. A young lady whom I had helped to cure herself\r\nof asthma from which she had suffered for eight years, told me one\r\nday that she wanted to have a tooth out. As I knew her to be very\r\nsensitive, I offered to make her feel nothing of the operation. She\r\nnaturally accepted with pleasure and we made an appointment with\r\nthe dentist. On the day we had arranged we presented ourselves at\r\nthe dentist's and, standing opposite my patient, I looked fixedly at\r\nher, saying: \"You feel nothing, you feel nothing, etc., etc.\" and then\r\nwhile still continuing the suggestion I made a sign to the dentist. In\r\nan instant the tooth was out without Mlle. D---- turning a hair. As\r\nfairly often happens, a haemorrhage followed, but I told the dentist\r\nthat I would try suggestion without his using a haemostatic, without\r\nknowing beforehand what would happen. I then asked Mlle. D---- to\r\nlook at me fixedly, and I suggested to her that in two minutes the\r\nhaemorrhage would cease of its own accord, and we waited. The\r\npatient spat blood again once or twice, and then ceased. I told her to\r\nopen her mouth, and we both looked and found that a clot of blood\r\nhad formed in the dental cavity.\r\n\r\nHow is this phenomenon to be explained? In the simplest way.\r\nUnder the influence of the idea: \"The haemorrhage is to stop\", the\r\nunconscious had sent to the small arteries and veins the order to stop\r\nthe flow of blood, and, obediently, they contracted _naturally_, as\r\nthey would have done artificially at the contact of a haemostatic like\r\nadrenalin, for example.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning explains how a fibrous tumour can be made to\r\ndisappear. The unconscious having accepted the idea \"It is to go\" the\r\nbrain orders the arteries which nourish it, to contract. They do so,\r\nrefusing their services, and ceasing to nourish the tumour which,\r\ndeprived of nourishment, dies, dries up, is reabsorbed and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF SUGGESTION FOR THE CURE OF MORAL\r\nAILMENTS AND TAINTS EITHER CONGENITAL OR\r\nACQUIRED\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia, so common nowadays, generally yields to suggestion\r\nconstantly practised in the way I have indicated. I have had the\r\nhappiness of contributing to the cure of a large number of\r\nneurasthenics with whom every other treatment had failed. One of\r\nthem had even spent a month in a special establishment at\r\nLuxemburg without obtaining any improvement. In six weeks he\r\nwas completely cured, and he is now the happiest man one would\r\nwish to find, after having thought himself the most miserable.\r\nNeither is he ever likely to fall ill again in the same way, for I\r\nshowed him how to make use of conscious autosuggestion and he\r\ndoes it marvelously well.\r\n\r\nBut if suggestion is useful in treating moral complaints and physical\r\nailments, may it not render still greater services to society, in\r\nturning into honest folks the wretched children who people our\r\nreformatories and who only leave them to enter the army of crime.\r\nLet no one tell me it is impossible. The remedy exists and I can\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nI will quote the two following cases which are very characteristic,\r\nbut here I must insert a few remarks in parenthesis. To make you\r\nunderstand the way in which suggestion acts in the treatment of\r\nmoral taints I will use the following comparison. Suppose our brain\r\nis a plank in which are driven nails which represent the ideas, habits,\r\nand instincts, which determine our actions. If we find that there\r\nexists in a subject a bad idea, a bad habit, a bad instinct,--as it were,\r\na bad nail, we take another which is the good idea, habit, or instinct,\r\nplace it on top of the bad one and give a tap with a hammer--in other\r\nwords we make a suggestion. The new nail will be driven in perhaps\r\na fraction of an inch, while the old one will come out to the same\r\nextent. At each fresh blow with the hammer, that is to say at each\r\nfresh suggestion, the one will be driven in a fraction further and the\r\nother will be driven out the same amount, until, after a certain\r\nnumber of blows, the old nail will come out completely and be\r\nreplaced by the new one. When this substitution has been made, the\r\nindividual obeys it.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our examples. Little M----, a child of eleven living at\r\nTroyes, was subject night and day to certain accidents inherent to\r\nearly infancy. He was also a kleptomaniac, and, of course, untruthful\r\ninto the bargain. At his mother's request I treated him by suggestion.\r\nAfter the first visit the accidents ceased by day, but continued at\r\nnight. Little by little they became less frequent, and finally, a few\r\nmonths afterwards, the child was completely cured. In the same\r\nperiod his thieving propensities lessened, and in six months they had\r\nentirely ceased.\r\n\r\nThis child's brother, aged eighteen, had conceived a violent hatred\r\nagainst another of his brothers. Every time that he had taken a little\r\ntoo much wine, he felt impelled to draw a knife and stab his brother.\r\nHe felt that one day or other he would end by doing so, and he knew\r\nat the same time that having done so he would be inconsolable. I\r\ntreated him also by suggestion, and the result was marvelous. After\r\nthe first treatment he was cured. His hatred for his brother had\r\ndisappeared, and they have since become good friends and got on\r\ncapitally together. I followed up the case for a long time, and the\r\ncure was permanent.\r\n\r\nSince such results are to be obtained by suggestion, would it not be\r\nbeneficial--I might even say _indispensable_--to take up this\r\nmethod and introduce it into our reformatories? I am absolutely\r\nconvinced that if suggestion were daily applied to vicious children,\r\nmore than 50 per cent could be reclaimed. Would it not be an\r\nimmense service to render society, to bring back to it sane and well\r\nmembers of it who were formerly corroded by moral decay?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I shall be told that suggestion is a dangerous thing, and that\r\nit can be used for evil purposes. This is no valid objection, first\r\nbecause the practice of suggestion would only be confided [by the\r\npatient] to reliable and honest people,--to the reformatory doctors,\r\nfor instance,--and on the other hand, those who seek to use it for evil\r\nask no one's permission.\r\n\r\nBut even admitting that it offers some danger (which is not so) I\r\nshould like to ask whoever proffers the objection, to tell me what\r\nthing we use that is not dangerous? Is it steam? gunpowder?\r\nrailways? ships? electricity? automobiles? aeroplanes? Are the\r\npoisons not dangerous which we, doctors and chemists, use daily in\r\nminute doses, and which might easily destroy the patient if, in a\r\nmoment's carelessness, we unfortunately made a mistake in\r\nweighing them out?\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW TYPICAL CURES\r\n\r\nThis little work would be incomplete if it did not include a few\r\nexamples of the cures obtained. It would take too long, and would\r\nalso perhaps be somewhat tiring if I were to relate all those in which\r\nI have taken part. I will therefore content myself by quoting a few of\r\nthe most remarkable.\r\n\r\nMlle. M---- D----, of Troyes, had suffered for eight years from\r\nasthma which obliged her to sit up in bed nearly all night, fighting\r\nfor breath. Preliminary experiments show that she is a very sensitive\r\nsubject. She sleeps immediately, and the suggestion is given. From\r\nthe first treatment there is an enormous improvement. The patient\r\nhas a good night, only interrupted by one attack of asthma which\r\nonly lasts a quarter of an hour. In a very short time the asthma\r\ndisappears completely and there is no relapse later on.\r\n\r\nM. M----, a working hosier living at Sainte-Savine near Troyes,\r\nparalyzed for two years as the result of injuries at the junction of the\r\nspinal column and the pelvis. The paralysis is only in the lower\r\nlimbs, in which the circulation of the blood has practically ceased,\r\nmaking them swollen, congested, and discolored. Several treatments,\r\nincluding the antisyphilitic, have been tried without success.\r\nPreliminary experiments successful; suggestion applied by me, and\r\nautosuggestion by the patient for eight days. At the end of this time\r\nthere is an almost imperceptible but still appreciable movement of\r\nthe left leg. Renewed suggestion. In eight days the improvement is\r\nnoticeable. Every week or fortnight there is an increased\r\nimprovement with progressive lessening of the swelling, and so on.\r\nEleven months afterwards, on the first of November, 1906, the\r\npatient goes downstairs alone and walks 800 yards, and in the month\r\nof July, 1907, goes back to the factory where he has continued to\r\nwork since that time, with no trace of paralysis.\r\n\r\nM. A---- G----, living at Troyes, has long suffered from enteritis, for\r\nwhich different treatments have been tried in vain. He is also in a\r\nvery bad state mentally, being depressed, gloomy, unsociable, and\r\nobsessed by thoughts of suicide. Preliminary experiments easy,\r\nfollowed by suggestion which produces an appreciable result from\r\nthe very day. For three months, daily suggestions to begin with, then\r\nat increasingly longer intervals. At the end of this time, the cure is\r\ncomplete, the enteritis has disappeared, and his _morals_ have\r\nbecome excellent. As the cure dates back twelve years without the\r\nshadow of a relapse, it may be considered as permanent. M. G----, is\r\na striking example of the effects that can be produced by suggestion,\r\nor rather by autosuggestion. At the same time as I made suggestions\r\nto him from the physical point of view, I also did so from the mental,\r\nand he accepted both suggestions equally well. Every day his\r\nconfidence in himself increased, and as he was an excellent\r\nworkman, in order to earn more, he looked out for a machine which\r\nwould enable him to work at home for his employer. A little later a\r\nfactory owner having seen with his own eyes what a good workman\r\nhe was, entrusted him with the very machine he desired. Thanks to\r\nhis skill he was able to turn out much more than an ordinary\r\nworkman, and his employer, delighted with the result, gave him\r\nanother and yet another machine, until M. G----, who, but for\r\nsuggestion, would have remained an ordinary workman, is now in\r\ncharge of six machines which bring him a very hand some profit.\r\n\r\nMme. D----, at Troyes, about 30 years of age. She is in the last\r\nstages of consumption, and grows thinner daily in spite of special\r\nnourishment. She suffers from coughing and spitting, and has\r\ndifficulty in breathing; in fact, from all appearances she has\r\nonly a few months to live. Preliminary experiments show\r\ngreat sensitiveness, and suggestion is followed by immediate\r\nimprovement. From the next day the morbid symptoms begin to\r\nlessen. Every day the improvement becomes more marked, the\r\npatient rapidly puts on flesh, although she no longer takes special\r\nnourishment. In a few months the cure is apparently complete. This\r\nperson wrote to me on the 1st of January, 1911, that is to say eight\r\nmonths after I had left Troyes, to thank me and to tell me that,\r\nalthough pregnant, she was perfectly well.\r\n\r\nI have purposely chosen these cases dating some time back, in order\r\nto show that the cures are permanent, but I should like to add a few\r\nmore recent ones.\r\n\r\nM. X----, Post Office clerk at Luneville. Having lost one of his\r\nchildren in January, 1910, the trouble produces in him a cerebral\r\ndisturbance which manifests itself by uncontrollable nervous\r\ntrembling. His uncle brings him to me in the month of June.\r\nPreliminary experiments followed by suggestion. Four days\r\nafterwards the patient returns to tell me that the trembling has\r\ndisappeared. I renew the suggestion and tell him to return in eight\r\ndays. A week, then a fortnight, then three weeks, then a month, pass\r\nby without my hearing any more of him. Shortly afterwards his\r\nuncle comes and tells me that he has just had a letter from his\r\nnephew, who is perfectly well. He has taken on again his work as\r\ntelegraphist which he had been obliged to give up, and the day\r\nbefore, he had sent off a telegram of 170 words without the least\r\ndifficulty. He could easily, he added in his letter, have sent off an\r\neven longer one. Since then he has had no relapse.\r\n\r\nM. Y----, of Nancy, has suffered from neurasthenia for several years.\r\nHe has aversions, nervous fears, and disorders of the stomach and\r\nintestines. He sleeps badly, is gloomy and is haunted by ideas of\r\nsuicide; he staggers when he walks like a drunken man, and can\r\nthink of nothing but his trouble. All treatments have failed and he\r\ngets worse and worse; a stay in a special nursing home for such\r\ncases has no effect whatever. M. Y---- comes to see me at the\r\nbeginning of October, 1910. Preliminary experiments comparatively\r\neasy. I explain to the patient the principles of autosuggestion, and\r\nthe existence within us of the conscious and the unconscious self,\r\nand then make the required suggestion. For two or three days\r\nM. Y---- has a little difficulty with the explanations I have given him.\r\nIn a short time light breaks in upon his mind, and he grasps the whole\r\nthing. I renew the suggestion, and he makes it himself too every day.\r\nThe improvement, which is at first slow, becomes more and more\r\nrapid, and in a month and a half the cure is complete. The ex-invalid\r\nwho had lately considered himself the most wretched of men, now\r\nthinks himself the happiest.\r\n\r\nM. E----, of Troyes. An attack of gout; the right ankle is inflamed\r\nand painful, and he is unable to walk. The preliminary experiments\r\nshow him to be a very sensitive subject. After the first treatment he\r\nis able to regain, without the help of his stick, the carriage which\r\nbrought him, and the pain has ceased. The next day he does not\r\nreturn as I had told him to do. Afterwards his wife comes alone and\r\ntells me that that morning her husband had got up, put on his shoes,\r\nand gone off on his bicycle to visit his yards (he is a painter). It is\r\nneedless to tell you my utter astonishment. I was not able to follow\r\nup this case, as the patient never deigned to come and see me again,\r\nbut some time afterward I heard that he had had no relapse.\r\n\r\nMme. T----, of Nancy. Neurasthenia, dyspepsia, gastralgia, enteritis,\r\nand pains in different parts of the body. She has treated herself for\r\nseveral years with a negative result. I treat her by suggestion, and\r\nshe makes autosuggestions for herself every day. From the first day\r\nthere is a noticeable improvement which continues without\r\ninterruption. At the present moment this person has long been cured\r\nmentally and physically, and follows no regimen. She thinks that she\r\nstill has perhaps a slight touch of enteritis, but she is not sure.\r\n\r\nMme. X----, a sister of Mme. T----. Acute neurasthenia; she stays in\r\nbed a fortnight every month, as it is totally impossible for her to\r\nmove or work; she suffers from lack of appetite, depression, and\r\ndigestive disorders. She is cured by one visit, and the cure seems to\r\nbe permanent as she has had no relapse.\r\n\r\nMme. H----, at Maxéville. General eczema, which is particularly\r\nsevere on the left leg. Both legs are inflamed, above all at the ankles;\r\nwalking is difficult and painful. I treat her by suggestion. That same\r\nevening Mme. H---- is able to walk several hundred yards without\r\nfatigue. The day after the feet and ankles are no longer swollen and\r\nhave not been swollen again since. The eczema disappears rapidly.\r\n\r\nMme. F----, at Laneuveville. Pains in the kidneys and the knees. The\r\nillness dates from ten years back and is becoming worse every day.\r\nSuggestion from me, and autosuggestion from herself. The\r\nimprovement is immediate and increases progressively. The cure is\r\nobtained rapidly, and is a permanent one.\r\n\r\nMme. Z----, of Nancy, felt ill in January, 1910, with congestion of\r\nthe lungs, from which she had not recovered two months later. She\r\nsuffers from general weakness, loss of appetite, bad digestive\r\ntrouble, rare and difficult bowel action, insomnia, copious\r\nnight-sweats. After the first suggestion, the patient feels much better,\r\nand two days later she returns and tells me that she feels quite well.\r\nEvery trace of illness has disappeared, and all the organs are\r\nfunctioning normally. Three or four times she had been on the point\r\nof sweating, but each time prevented it by the use of conscious\r\nautosuggestion. From this time Mme. Z---- has enjoyed perfectly\r\ngood health.\r\n\r\nM. X----, at Belfort, cannot talk for more than ten minutes or a\r\nquarter of an hour without becoming completely aphonous.\r\nDifferent doctors consulted find no lesion in the vocal organs, but\r\none of them says that M. X---- suffers from senility of the larynx,\r\nand this conclusion confirms him in the belief that he is incurable.\r\nHe comes to spend his holidays at Nancy, and a lady of my\r\nacquaintance advises him to come and see me. He refuses at first,\r\nbut eventually consents in spite of his absolute disbelief in the\r\neffects of suggestion. I treat him in this way nevertheless, and ask\r\nhim to return two days afterwards. He comes back on the appointed\r\nday, and tells me that the day before he was able to converse the\r\nwhole afternoon without becoming aphonous. Two days later he\r\nreturns again to say that his trouble had not reappeared, although he\r\nhad not only conversed a great deal but even sung the day before.\r\nThe cure still holds good and I am convinced that it will always do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nBefore closing, I should like to say a few words on the application\r\nof my method to the training and correction of children by their\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe latter should wait until the child is asleep, and then one of them\r\nshould enter his room with precaution, stop a yard from his bed, and\r\nrepeat 15 or 20 times in a murmur all the things they wish to obtain\r\nfrom the child, from the point of view of health, work, sleep,\r\napplication, conduct, etc. He should then retire as he came, taking\r\ngreat care not to awake the child. This extremely simple process\r\ngives the best possible results, and it is easy to understand why.\r\nWhen the child is asleep his body and his conscious self are at rest\r\nand, as it were, annihilated; his unconscious self however is awake;\r\nit is then to the latter alone that one speaks, and as it is very\r\ncredulous it accepts what one says to it without dispute, so that, little\r\nby little, the child arrives at making of himself what his parents\r\ndesire him to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWhat conclusion is to be drawn from all this?\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is very simple and can be expressed in a few words:\r\nWe possess within us a force of incalculable power, which, when we\r\nhandle it unconsciously is often prejudicial to us. If on the contrary\r\nwe direct it in a conscious and wise manner, it gives us the mastery\r\nof ourselves and allows us not only to escape and to aid others to\r\nescape, from physical and mental ills, but also to live in relative\r\nhappiness, whatever the conditions in which we may find ourselves.\r\n\r\nLastly, and above all, it should be applied to the moral regeneration\r\nof those who have wandered from the right path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS AND PRECEPTS OF EMILE COUÉ\r\n\r\n_taken down literally by Mme. Emile Leon, his disciple._\r\n\r\nDo not spend your time in thinking of illness you might have, for if\r\nyou have no real ones you will create artificial ones.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhen you make conscious autosuggestions, do it naturally, simply,\r\nwith conviction, and above all _without any effort._ If unconscious\r\nand bad autosuggestions are so often realized, it is because they are\r\nmade without effort.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBe sure that you will obtain what you want, and you will obtain it,\r\nso long as it is within reason.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo become master of oneself it is enough to think that one is\r\nbecoming so. . . . Your hands tremble, your steps falter, tell yourself\r\nthat all that is going to cease, and little by little it will disappear.\r\nIt is not in me but in yourself that you must have confidence, for it\r\nis in yourself alone that dwells the force which can cure you. My part\r\nsimply consists in teaching you to make use of that force.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNever discuss things you know nothing about, or you will only\r\nmake yourself ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThings which seem miraculous to you have a perfectly natural cause;\r\nif they seem extraordinary it is only because the cause escapes you.\r\nWhen you know that, you realize that nothing could be more natural.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhen the will and the imagination are in conflict, it is always the\r\nimagination which wins. Such a case is only too frequent, and then\r\nnot only do we not do what we want, but just the contrary of what\r\nwe want. For example: the more we try to go to sleep, the more we\r\ntry to remember the name of some one, the more we try to stop\r\nlaughing, the more we try to avoid an obstacle, while _thinking that\r\nwe cannot do so,_ the more excited we become, the less we can\r\nremember the name, the more uncontrollable our laughter becomes,\r\nand the more surely we rush upon the obstacle.\r\n\r\nIt is then the imagination and not the will which is the most\r\nimportant faculty of man; and thus it is a serious mistake to advise\r\npeople to train their wills, it is the training of their imaginations\r\nwhich they ought to set about.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThings are not for us what they are, but what they seem; this\r\nexplains the contradictory evidence of persons speaking in all good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBy believing oneself to be the master of one's thoughts one becomes\r\nso.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nEveryone of our thoughts, good or bad, becomes concrete,\r\nmaterializes, and becomes in short a reality.\r\n\r\nWe are what we make ourselves and not what circumstances make\r\nus.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhoever starts off in life with the idea: \"I shall succeed\", always\r\ndoes succeed because he does what is necessary to bring about this\r\nresult. If only one opportunity presents itself to him, and if this\r\nopportunity has, as it were, only one hair on its head, he seizes it by\r\nthat one hair. Further, he often brings about unconsciously or not,\r\npropitious circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe who on the contrary always doubts himself, never succeeds in\r\ndoing anything. He might find himself in the midst of an army of\r\nopportunities with heads of hair like Absalom, and yet he would not\r\nsee them and could not seize a single one, even if he had only to\r\nstretch out his hand in order to do so. And if he brings about\r\ncircumstances, they are generally unfavorable ones. Do not then\r\nblame fate, you have only yourself to blame.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPeople are always preaching the doctrine of effort, but this idea must\r\nbe repudiated. Effort means will, and will means the possible\r\nentrance of the imagination in opposition, and the bringing about of\r\nthe exactly contrary result to the desired one.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAlways think that what you have to do is easy, if possible. In this\r\nstate of mind you will not spend more of your strength than just\r\nwhat is necessary; if you consider it difficult, you will spend ten,\r\ntwenty times more strength than you need; in other words you will\r\nwaste it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion is an instrument which you have to learn how to use\r\njust as you would for any other instrument. An excellent gun in\r\ninexperienced hands only gives wretched results, but the more\r\nskilled the same hands become, the more easily they place the\r\nbullets in the target.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nConscious autosuggestion, made with confidence, with faith, with\r\nperseverance, realizes itself mathematically, within reason.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhen certain people do not obtain satisfactory results with\r\nautosuggestion, it is either because they lack confidence, or because\r\nthey make efforts, which is the more frequent case. To make good\r\nsuggestions it is absolutely necessary to do it _without effort._ The\r\nlatter implies the use of the _will,_ which must be entirely put aside.\r\nOne must have recourse _exclusively_ to the imagination.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMany people who have taken care of their health all their life in vain,\r\nimagine that they can be immediately cured by autosuggestion. It is\r\na mistake, for it is not reasonable to think so. It is no use expecting\r\nfrom suggestion more than it can normally produce, that is to say, a\r\nprogressive improvement which little by little transforms itself into a\r\ncomplete cure, when that is possible.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe means employed by the healers all go back to autosuggestion,\r\nthat is to say that these methods, whatever they are, words,\r\nincantations, gestures, staging, all produce in the patient the\r\nautosuggestion of recovery.\r\n\r\nEvery illness has two aspects unless it is exclusively a mental one.\r\nIndeed, on every physical illness a mental one comes and attaches\r\nitself. If we give to the physical illness the coefficient 1, the mental\r\nillness may have the coefficient 1, 2, 10, 20, 50, 100, and more. In\r\nmany cases this can disappear instantaneously, and if its coefficient\r\nis a very high one, 100 for instance, while that of the physical\r\nailment is 1, only this latter is left, a 101st of the total illness;\r\nsuch a thing is called a miracle, and yet there is nothing miraculous\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nContrary to common opinion, physical diseases are generally far\r\nmore easily cured than mental ones.\r\n\r\nBuffon used to say: \"Style is the man.\" We would put in that: \"Man\r\nis what he thinks\". The fear of failure is almost certain to cause\r\nfailure, in the same way as the idea of success brings success, and\r\nenables one always to surmount the obstacles that may be met with.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nConviction is as necessary to the suggester as to his subject. It is this\r\nconviction, this faith, which enables him to obtain results where all\r\nother means have failed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt is not the person who acts, it is the method.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n. . . Contrary to general opinion, suggestion, or autosuggestion can\r\nbring about the cure of organic lesions.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was believed that hypnotism could only be applied to the\r\ntreatment of nervous illnesses; its domain is far greater than that. It\r\nis true that hypnotism acts through the intermediary of the nervous\r\nsystem; but the nervous system dominates the whole organism. The\r\nmuscles are set in movement by the nerves; the nerves regulate the\r\ncirculation by their direct action on the heart, and by their action on\r\nthe blood vessels which they dilate or contract. The nerves act then\r\non all the organs, and by their intermediation all the unhealthy\r\norgans may be affected.\r\n\r\nDocteur Paul Joire, _Président of the Societe universelle d'Etudes\r\npsychiques_ (Bull. No. 4 of the S. L. P.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n. . . Moral influence has a considerable value as a help in healing. It\r\nis a factor of the first order which it would be very wrong to neglect,\r\nsince in medicine as in every branch of human activity it is the\r\n_spiritual forces_ which lead the world.\r\n\r\nDocteur Louis Renon, _Lecturing professor at the Faculty of\r\nMedicine of Paris, and doctor at the Necker Hospital._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n. . . Never lose sight of the great principle of autosuggestion:\r\n_Optimism always and in spite of everything, even when events do\r\nnot seem to justify it._\r\n\r\nRené de Drabois, (Bull. 11 of the S. L. P. A.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSuggestion sustained by faith is a formidable force.\r\n\r\nDocteur A. L., Paris, (July, 1920.)\r\n\r\nTo have and to inspire unalterable confidence, one must walk with\r\nthe assurance of perfect sincerity, and in order to possess this\r\nassurance and sincerity, one must wish for _the good of others_\r\nmore than one's own.\r\n\r\n\"Culture de la Force Morale\", by C. Baudouin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON WHAT AUTOSUGGESTION CAN DO\r\n\r\nYoung B----, 13 years old, enters the hospital in January 1912. He\r\nhas a very serious heart complaint characterized by a peculiarity in\r\nthe respiration; he has such difficulty in breathing that he can only\r\ntake very slow and short steps. The doctor who attends him, one of\r\nour best practitioners, predicts a rapid and fatal issue. The invalid\r\nleaves the hospital in February, _no better._ A friend of his family\r\nbrings him to me and when I see him I regard him as a hopeless case,\r\nbut nevertheless I make him pass through the preliminary\r\nexperiments which are marvelously successful. After having made\r\nhim a suggestion and advised him to do the same thing for himself, I\r\ntell him to come back in two days. When he does so I notice to my\r\nastonishment a _remarkable_ improvement in his respiration and his\r\nwalking. I renew the suggestion and two days afterwards, when he\r\nreturns the improvement has continued, and so it is at every visit. So\r\nrapid is the progress that he makes that, three weeks after the first\r\nvisit, my little patient is able to go _on foot_ with his mother to the\r\nplateau of Villers. He can breathe with ease and almost normally, he\r\ncan walk without getting out of breath, and can mount the stairs,\r\nwhich was impossible for him before. As the improvement is\r\nsteadily maintained, little B---- asks me if he can go and stay with\r\nhis grandmother at Carignan. As he seems well I advise him to do so,\r\nand he goes off, but sends me news of himself from time to time.\r\nHis health is becoming better and better, he has a good appetite,\r\ndigests and assimilates his food well, and the feeling of oppression\r\nhas entirely disappeared. Not only can he walk like everybody else,\r\nbut he even runs and chases butterflies.\r\n\r\nHe returns in October, and I can hardly recognize him, for the bent\r\nand puny little fellow who had left me in May has become a tall\r\nupright boy, whose face beams with health. He has grown 12\r\ncentimeters and gained 19 lbs. in weight. Since then he has lived a\r\nperfectly normal life; he runs up and down stairs, rides a bicycle,\r\nand plays football with his comrades.\r\n\r\nMlle. X----, of Geneva, aged 13. Sore on the temple considered by\r\nseveral doctors as being of tubercular origin; for a year and a half it\r\nhas refused to yield to the different treatments ordered. She is taken\r\nto M. Baudouin, a follower of M. Coué at Geneva, who treats her by\r\nsuggestion and tells her to return in a week. When she comes back\r\nthe sore has healed.\r\n\r\nMlle. Z----, also of Geneva. Has had the right leg drawn up for 17\r\nyears, owing to an abscess above the knee which had had to be\r\noperated upon. She asks M. Baudouin to treat her by suggestion, and\r\nhardly has he begun when the leg can be bent and unbent in a\r\nnormal manner. (There was of course a psychological cause in this\r\ncase.)\r\n\r\nMme. Urbain Marie, aged 55, at Maxéville. Varicose nicer, dating\r\nfrom more than a year and a half. First visit in September, 1915, and\r\na second one a week later. In a fortnight the cure is complete.\r\n\r\nEmile Chenu, 10 years old, Grande-Rue, 19 (a refugee from Metz).\r\nSome unknown heart complaint with vegetations. Every night loses\r\nblood by the mouth. Comes first in July, 1915, and after a few visits\r\nthe loss of blood diminishes, and continues to do so until by the end\r\nof November it has ceased completely. The vegetations also seem to\r\nbe no longer there, and by August, 1916, there had been no relapse.\r\n\r\nM. Hazot, aged 48, living at Brin. Invalided the 15th of January,\r\n1915, with _specific_ chronic bronchitis, which is getting worse\r\nevery day. He comes in to me in October, 1915. The improvement is\r\nimmediate, and has been maintained since. At the present moment,\r\nalthough he is not completely cured, he is very much better.\r\n\r\nM. B----, has suffered for 24 years from frontal sinus, which had\r\nnecessitated eleven operations!! In spite of all that had been done the\r\nsinus persisted, accompanied by intolerable pains. The physical state\r\nof the patient was pitiable in the extreme; he had violent and almost\r\ncontinuous pain, extreme weakness; lack of appetite, could neither\r\nwalk, read nor sleep, etc. His nerves were in nearly as bad a state as\r\nhis body, and in spite of the treatment of such men as Bernheim of\r\nNancy, Dejerine of Paris, Dubois of Bern, X---- of Strasburg, his ill\r\nhealth not only continued but even grew worse every day. The\r\npatient comes to me in September, 1915, on the advice of one of my\r\nother patients. From that moment he made rapid progress and at the\r\npresent time (1921) he is perfectly well. It is a real resurrection.\r\n\r\nM. Nagengast, aged 18, rue Sellier, 39. Suffering from Pott's disease.\r\nComes to me in the beginning of 1914, having been encased for six\r\nmonths in a plaster corset. Comes regularly twice a week to the\r\n\"séances,\" and makes for himself the usual suggestion morning and\r\nevening. Improvement soon shows itself, and in a short time the\r\npatient is able to do without his plaster casing. I saw him again in\r\nApril, 1916. He was completely cured, and was carrying on his\r\nduties as postman, after having been assistant to an ambulance at\r\nNancy, where he had stayed until it was done away with.\r\n\r\nM. D----, at Jarville. Paralysis of the left upper eyelid. Goes to the\r\nhospital where he receives injections, as a result of which the eyelid\r\nis raised. The left eye was, however, deflected outwards for more\r\nthan 45 degrees, and an operation seemed to be necessary. It was at\r\nthis moment that he came to me, and thanks to autosuggestion the\r\neye went back little by little to its normal position.\r\n\r\nMme. L----, of Nancy. Continuous pain in the right side of the face,\r\nwhich had gone on for 10 years. She has consulted many doctors\r\nwhose prescriptions seemed of no use, and an operation is judged to\r\nbe necessary. The patient comes to me on the 25th of July, 1916,\r\nand there is an immediate improvement. In about ten days' time the\r\npain has entirely vanished, and up to the 20th of December, there\r\nhad been no recurrence.\r\n\r\nT---- Maurice, aged 8 and a half, at Nancy: club feet. A first\r\noperation cures, or nearly so, the left foot, while the right one still\r\nremains crippled. Two subsequent operations do no good. The child\r\nis brought to me for the first time in February, 1915; he walks pretty\r\nwell, thanks to two contrivances which hold his feet straight. The\r\nfirst visit is followed by an immediate improvement, and after the\r\nsecond, the child is able to walk in ordinary boots.  The\r\nimprovement becomes more and more marked, by the 17th of April\r\nthe child is quite well. The right foot, however, is not now quite so\r\nstrong as it was, owing to a sprain which he gave it in February,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nMlle X----, at Blainville. A sore on the left foot, probably of specific\r\norigin. A slight sprain has brought about a swelling of the foot\r\naccompanied by acute pains. Different treatments have only had a\r\nnegative effect, and in a little while a suppurating sore appears\r\nwhich seems to indicate caries of the bone. Walking becomes more\r\nand more painful and difficult in spite of the treatment. On the\r\nadvice of a former patient who had been cured, she comes to me,\r\nand there is noticeable relief after the first visits. Little by little the\r\nswelling goes down, the pain becomes less intense, the suppuration\r\nlessens, and finally the sore heals over. The process has taken a few\r\nmonths. At present the foot is practically normal, but although the\r\npain and swelling have entirely disappeared, the back flexion of the\r\nfoot is not yet perfect, which makes the patient limp slightly.\r\n\r\nMme. R----, of Chavigny. Metritis dating from 10 years back.\r\nComes at the end of July, 1916. Improvement is immediate, the pain\r\nand loss of blood diminish rapidly, and by the following 29th of\r\nSeptember both have disappeared. The monthly period, which lasted\r\nfrom eight to ten days, is now over in four.\r\n\r\nMme. H----, rue Guilbert-de-Pivérécourt, at Nancy, aged 49. Suffers\r\nfrom a varicose ulcer dating from September, 1914, which has\r\ntreated according to her doctor's advice, but without success. The\r\nlower part of the leg is enormous (the ulcer, which is as large as a\r\ntwo franc piece and goes right down to the bone, is situated above\r\nthe ankle). The inflammation is very intense, the suppuration\r\ncopious, and the pains extremely violent. The patient comes for the\r\nfirst time in April, 1916, and the improvement which is visible after\r\nthe first treatment, continues without interruption. By the 18th of\r\nFebruary, 1917, the swelling has _entirely subsided,_ and the pain\r\nand irritation have disappeared. The sore is still there, but it is no\r\nlarger than a pea and it is only a few millimeters in depth; it still\r\ndischarges very slightly. By 1920 the cure has long been complete.\r\n\r\nMlle. D----, at Mirecourt, 16 years of age. Has suffered from attacks\r\nof nerves for three years. The attacks, at first infrequent, have\r\ngradually come at closer intervals. When she comes to see me on the\r\n1st of April, 1917, she has had three attacks in the preceding\r\nfortnight. Up to the 18th of April she did not have any at all. I may\r\nadd that this young lady, from the time she began the treatment, was\r\nno longer troubled by the bad headaches from which she had\r\nsuffered almost constantly.\r\n\r\nMme. M----, aged 43, rue d'Amance, 2, Malzéville. Comes at the\r\nend of 1916 for violent pains in the head from which she has\r\nsuffered all her life. After a few visits they vanish completely. Two\r\nmonths afterwards she realized that she was also cured of a prolapse\r\nof the uterus which she had not mentioned to me, and of which she\r\nwas not thinking when she made her autosuggestion. (This result is\r\ndue to the words: _\"in every respect\"_ contained in the formula used\r\nmorning and evening.)\r\n\r\nMme. D----, Choisy-le-Roi. Only one general suggestion from me in\r\nJuly, 1916, and autosuggestion on her part morning and evening. In\r\nOctober of the same year this lady tells me that she is cured of a\r\nprolapse of the uterus from which she had suffered for more than\r\ntwenty years. Up to April, 1920, the cure is still holding good.\r\n(Same remark as in the preceding case.)\r\n\r\nMme. Jousselin, aged 60, rue des Dominicains, 6. Comes on the\r\n20th of July, 1917, for a violent pain in the right leg, accompanied\r\nby considerable swelling of the whole limb. She can only drag\r\nherself along with groans, but after the \"séance,\" to her great\r\nastonishment, she can walk _normally_ without feeling the least\r\npain. When she comes back four days afterwards, she has had no\r\nreturn of the pain and the swelling has subsided. This patient tells\r\nme that since she has attended the \"séances\" she has also been cured\r\nof white discharges, and of enteritis from which she had long\r\nsuffered. (Same remark as above.) In November the cure is still\r\nholding good.\r\n\r\nMlle. G. L.----, aged 15, rue du Montet, 88. Has stammered from\r\ninfancy. Comes on the 20th of July, 1917, and the stammering\r\nceases instantly. A month after I saw her again and she had had no\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\nM. Ferry (Eugène), aged 60, rue de la Côte, 56. For five years has\r\nsuffered from rheumatic pains in the shoulders and in the left leg.\r\nWalks with difficulty leaning on a stick, and cannot lift the arms\r\nhigher than the shoulders. Comes on the 17th of September, 1917.\r\nAfter the first \"séance,\" the pains vanish completely and the patient\r\ncan not only take long strides but even _run._ Still more, he can\r\nwhirl both arms like a windmill. In November the cure is still\r\nholding good.\r\n\r\nMme. Lacour, aged 63, chemin des Sables. Pains in the face dating\r\nfrom more than twenty years back. All treatments have failed. An\r\noperation is advised, but the patient refuses to undergo it. She comes\r\nfor the first time on July 25th, 1916, and four days later the pain\r\nceases. The cure has held good to this day.\r\n\r\nMme. Martin, Grande-Rue (Ville-Vieille), 105. Inflammation of the\r\nuterus of 13 years standing, accompanied by pains and white and red\r\ndischarges. The period, which is very painful, recurs every 22 or 23\r\ndays and lasts 10-12 days. Comes for the first time on the 15th of\r\nNovember, 1917, and returns regularly every week. There is visible\r\nimprovement after the first visit, which continues rapidly until at the\r\nbeginning of January, 1918, the inflammation has entirely\r\ndisappeared; the period comes at more regular intervals and without\r\nthe slightest pain. A pain in the knee which the patient had had for\r\n13 years was also cured.\r\n\r\nMme. Castelli, aged 41, living at Einville (M.-et M.). Has suffered\r\nfrom intermittent rheumatic pains in the right knee for 13 years. Five\r\nyears ago she had a more violent attack than usual, the leg swells as\r\nwell as the knee, then the lower part of the limb atrophies, and the\r\npatient is reduced to walking very painfully with the aid of a stick or\r\ncrutch. She comes for the first time on the 5th of November, 1917.\r\nShe goes away _without the help of either crutch or stick._ Since\r\nthen she no longer uses her crutch at all, but occasionally makes use\r\nof her stick. The pain in the knee comes back from time to time, but\r\nonly very slightly.\r\n\r\nMme. Meder, aged 52, at Einville. For six months has suffered from\r\npain in the right knee accompanied by swelling, which makes it\r\nimpossible to bend the leg. Comes for the first time on Dec. 7th,\r\n1917. Returns on Jan. 4th, 1918, saying that she has almost ceased\r\nto suffer and that she can walk normally. After that visit of the 4th,\r\nthe pain ceases entirely, and the patient walks like other people.\r\n\r\nEMILE COUÉ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION AS IT OUGHT TO BE\r\n\r\nIt may seem paradoxical but, nevertheless, the Education of a child\r\nought to begin before its birth.\r\n\r\nIn sober truth, if a woman, a few weeks after conception, makes a\r\nmental picture of the sex of the child she is going to bring forth into\r\nthe world, of the physical and moral qualities with which she desires\r\nto see it endowed and if she will continue during the time of\r\ngestation to impress on herself the same mental image, the child will\r\nhave the sex and qualities desired.\r\n\r\nSpartan women only brought forth robust children, who grew to be\r\nredoubtable warriors, because their strongest desire was to give such\r\nheroes to their country; whilst, at Athens, mothers had intellectual\r\nchildren whose mental qualities were a hundredfold greater than\r\ntheir physical attributes.\r\n\r\nThe child thus engendered will be apt to accept readily good\r\nsuggestions which may be made to him and to transform them into\r\nautosuggestion which later, will influence the course of his life. For\r\nyou must know that all our words, all our acts, are only the result of\r\nautosuggestions caused, for the most part, by the suggestion of\r\nexample or speech.\r\n\r\nHow then should parents, and those entrusted with the education of\r\nchildren avoid provoking bad autosuggestions and, on the other\r\nhand, influence good autosuggestions?\r\n\r\nIn dealing with children, always be even-tempered and speak in a\r\ngentle but firm tone. In this way they will become obedient without\r\never having the slightest desire to resist authority.\r\n\r\nAbove all--above all, avoid harshness and brutality, for there the risk\r\nis incurred of influencing an autosuggestion of cruelty accompanied\r\nby hate.\r\n\r\nMoreover, avoid carefully, in their presence, saying evil of anyone,\r\nas too often happens, when, without any deliberate intention, the\r\nabsent nurse is picked to pieces in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nInevitably this fatal example will be followed, and may produce\r\nlater a real catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAwaken in them a desire to know the reason of things and a love of\r\nNature, and endeavor to interest them by giving all possible\r\nexplanations very clearly, in a cheerful, good-tempered tone. You\r\nmust answer their questions pleasantly, instead of checking them\r\nwith--\"What a bother you are, do be quiet, you will learn that later.\"\r\n\r\nNever on any account say to a child, \"You are lazy and good for\r\nnothing\" because that gives birth in him to the very faults of which\r\nyou accuse him.\r\n\r\nIf a child is lazy and does his tasks badly, you should say to him one\r\nday, even if it is not true, \"There this time your work is much better\r\nthan it generally is. Well done\". The child, flattered by the\r\nunaccustomed commendation, will certainly work better the next\r\ntime, and, little by little, thanks to judicious encouragement, will\r\nsucceed in becoming a real worker.\r\n\r\nAt all costs avoid speaking of illness before children, as it will\r\ncertainly create in them bad autosuggestions. Teach them, on the\r\ncontrary, that health is the normal state of man, and that sickness is\r\nan anomaly, a sort of backsliding which may be avoided by living in\r\na temperate, regular way.\r\n\r\nDo not create defects in them by teaching them to fear this or that,\r\ncold or heat, rain or wind, etc. Man is created to endure such\r\nvariations without injury and should do so without grumbling.\r\n\r\nDo not make the child nervous by filling his mind with stories of\r\nhob-goblins and were-wolves, for there is always the risk that\r\ntimidity contracted in childhood will persist later.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that those who do not bring up then children\r\nthemselves should choose carefully those to whom they are\r\nentrusted. To love them is not sufficient, they must have the\r\nqualities you desire your children to possess.\r\n\r\nAwaken in them the love of work and of study, making it easier by\r\nexplaining things carefully and in a pleasant fashion, and by\r\nintroducing in the explanation some anecdote which will make the\r\nchild eager for the following lesson.\r\n\r\nAbove all impress on them that Work is essential for man, and that\r\nhe who does not work in some fashion or another, is a worthless,\r\nuseless creature, and that all work produces in the man who engages\r\nin it a healthy and profound satisfaction; whilst idleness, so longed\r\nfor and desired by some, produces weariness, neurasthenia, disgust\r\nof life, and leads those who do not possess the means of satisfying\r\nthe passions created by idleness, to debauchery and even to crime.\r\n\r\nTeach children to be always polite and kind to all, and particularly to\r\nthose whom the chance of birth has placed in a lower class than their\r\nown, and also to respect age, and never to mock at the physical or\r\nmoral defects that age often produces.\r\n\r\nTeach them to love all mankind, without distinction of caste. That\r\none must always be ready to succor those who are in need of help,\r\nand that one must never be afraid of spending time and money for\r\nthose who are in need; in short, that they must think more of others\r\nthan of themselves.\r\n\r\nIn so doing an inner satisfaction is experienced that the egoist ever\r\nseeks and never finds.\r\n\r\nDevelop in them self-confidence, and teach that, before embarking\r\nupon any undertaking, it should be submitted to the control of\r\nreason, thus avoiding acting impulsively, and, after having reasoned\r\nthe matter out, one should form a decision by which one abides,\r\nunless, indeed, some fresh fact proves you may have been mistaken.\r\n\r\nTeach them above all that every one must set out in life with a very\r\ndefinite idea that he will succeed, and that, under the influence of\r\nthis idea he will inevitably succeed. Not indeed, that he should\r\nquietly remain expecting events to happen, but because, impelled by\r\nthis idea, he will do what is necessary to make it come true.\r\n\r\nHe will know how to take advantage of opportunities, or even\r\nperhaps of the single opportunity which may present itself, it may be\r\nonly a single thread or hair, whilst he who distrusts himself is a\r\nConstant Guignard with whom nothing succeeds, because his efforts\r\nare all directed to that end.\r\n\r\nSuch a one may indeed swim in an ocean of opportunities, provided\r\nwith heads of hair like Absalom himself, and he will be unable to\r\nseize a single hair, and often determines himself the causes which\r\nmake him fail; whilst he, who has the idea of success in himself,\r\noften gives birth, in an unconscious fashion, to the very\r\ncircumstances which produce that same success.\r\n\r\nBut above all, let parents and masters preach by example. A child is\r\nextremely suggestive, let something turn up that he wishes to do,\r\nand he does it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as children can speak, make them repeat morning and\r\nevening, twenty times consecutively:\r\n\r\n\"Day by day, in all respects, I grow better\", which will produce in\r\nthem an excellent physical, moral and healthy atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf you make the following suggestion you will help the child\r\nenormously to eliminate his faults, and to awaken in him the\r\ncorresponding desirable qualities.\r\n\r\nEvery night when the child is asleep, approach quietly, so as not to\r\nawaken him, to within about three or four feet from his bed. Stand\r\nthere, murmuring in a low monotonous voice the thing or things you\r\nwish him to do.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is desirable that all teachers should, every morning, make\r\nsuggestions to their pupils, somewhat in the following fashion.\r\n\r\nTelling them to shut their eyes, they should say: \"Children, I expect\r\nyou always to be polite and kind to everyone, obedient to your\r\nparents and teachers, when they give you an order, or tell you\r\nanything; you will always listen to the order given or the fact told\r\nwithout thinking it tiresome; you used to think it tiresome when you\r\nwere reminded of anything, but now you understand very well that it\r\nis for your good that you are told things, and consequently, instead\r\nof being cross with those who speak to you, you will now be\r\ngrateful to them.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover you will now love your work, whatever it may be; in\r\nyour lessons you will always enjoy those things you may have to\r\nlearn, especially whatever you may not till now have cared for.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover when the teacher is giving a lesson in class, you will now\r\ndevote all your attention, solely and entirely to what he says, instead\r\nof attending to any silly things said or done by your companions,\r\nand without doing or saying anything silly yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Under these conditions as you are all intelligent, for, children, you\r\nare all intelligent, you will understand easily and remember easily\r\nwhat you have learned. It will remain embedded in your memory,\r\nready to be at your service, and you will be able to make use of it as\r\nsoon as you need it.\r\n\r\n\"In the same way when you are working at your lessons alone, or at\r\nhome, when you are accomplishing a task or studying a lesson, you\r\nwill fix your attention solely on the work you are doing, and you\r\nwill always obtain good marks for your lessons.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the Counsel, which, if followed faithfully and truly from\r\nhenceforth, will produce a race endowed with the highest physical\r\nand moral qualities.\r\n\r\nEmile Coué.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SURVEY OF THE \"SÉANCES\" AT M. COUÉ'S\r\n\r\nThe town thrills at this name, for from every rank of society people\r\ncome to him and everyone is welcomed with the same benevolence,\r\nwhich already goes for a good deal. But what is extremely poignant\r\nis at the end of the séance to see the people who came in gloomy,\r\nbent, almost hostile (they were in pain), go away like everybody else;\r\nunconstrained, cheerful, sometimes radiant (they are no longer in\r\npain!!). With a strong and smiling goodness of which he has the\r\nsecret, M. Coué, as it were, holds the hearts of those who consult\r\nhim in his hand; he addresses himself in turn to the numerous\r\npersons who come to consult him, and speaks to them in these terms:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Madame, and what is your trouble? . . .\"\r\n\r\nOh, you are looking for two many whys and wherefores; what does\r\nthe cause of your pain matter to you? You are in pain, that is\r\nenough . . . I will teach you to get rid of that. . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd you, Monsieur, your varicose ulcer is already better. That is\r\ngood, very good indeed, do you know, considering you have only\r\nbeen here twice; I congratulate you on the result you have obtained.\r\nIf you go on doing your autosuggestions properly, you will very\r\nsoon be cured. . . . You have had this ulcer for ten years, you say?\r\nWhat does that matter? You might have had it twenty and more, and\r\nit could be cured just the same.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd you say that you have not obtained any improvement? . . . Do\r\nyou know why? . . . Simply because you lack confidence in yourself.\r\nWhen I tell you that you are better, you feel better at once, don't you?\r\nWhy? Because you have faith in me. Just believe in yourself and\r\nyou will obtain the same result.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOh, Madame not so many details, I beg you! By looking out for the\r\ndetails you create them, and you would want a list a yard long to\r\ncontain all your maladies. As a matter of fact, with you it is the\r\nmental outlook which is wrong. Well, make up your mind that it is\r\ngoing to get better and it will be so. It's as simple as the\r\nGospel. . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou tell me you have attacks of nerves every week. . . . Well, from\r\nto-day you are going to do what I tell you and you will cease to have\r\nthem. . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou have suffered from constipation for a long time? . . . What does\r\nit matter how long it is? . . . You say it is forty years? Yes, I heard\r\nwhat you said, but it is none the less true that you can be cured\r\nto-morrow; you hear, to-morrow, on condition, naturally, of your doing\r\nexactly what I tell you to do, in the way I tell you to do it. . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAh! you have glaucoma, Madame. I cannot absolutely promise to\r\ncure you of that, for I am not sure that I can. That does not mean that\r\nyou cannot be cured, for I have known it to happen in the case of a\r\nlady of Chalon-sur-Saône and another of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nWell, Mademoiselle, as you have not had your nervous attacks since\r\nyou came here, whereas you used to have them every day, you are\r\ncured. Come back sometimes all the same, so that I may keep you\r\ngoing along the right lines.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe feeling of oppression will disappear with the lesions which will\r\ndisappear when you assimilate properly; that will come all in good\r\ntime, but you mustn't put the cart before the horse . . . it is the same\r\nwith oppression as with heart trouble, it generally diminishes very\r\nquickly. . . .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSuggestion does not prevent you from going on with your usual\r\ntreatment. . . . As for the blemish you have on your eye, and which is\r\nlessening almost daily, the opacity and the size are both growing\r\nless every day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo a child (in a clear and commanding voice): \"Shut your eyes, I\r\nam not going to talk to you about lesions or anything else, you\r\nwould not understand; the pain in your chest is going away, and you\r\nwon't want to cough any more.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Observation.--_It is curious to notice that all those suffering from\r\nchronic bronchitis are immediately relieved and their morbid\r\nsymptoms rapidly disappear. . . . Children, are very easy and very\r\nobedient subjects; their organism almost always obeys immediately\r\nto suggestion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo a person who complains of fatigue: Well, so do I. There are also\r\ndays when it tires me to receive people, but I receive them all the\r\nsame and all day long. Do not say: _\"I cannot help it.\" \"One can\r\nalways overcome oneself.\"_\r\n\r\n_Observation.--_The idea of fatigue necessarily brings fatigue, and\r\nthe idea that we have a duty to accomplish always gives us the\r\nnecessary strength to fulfill it. The mind can and must remain master\r\nof the animal side of our nature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe cause which prevents you from walking, whatever it is, is going\r\nto disappear little by little every day: you know the proverb:\r\n_Heaven helps those who help themselves._ Stand up two or three\r\ntimes a day supporting yourself on two persons, and say to yourself\r\nfirmly: _My kidneys are not so weak that I cannot do it, on the\r\ncontrary I can. . . ._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter having said: \"Every day, in every respect, I am getting better\r\nand better,\" add: \"The people who are pursuing me _cannot_ pursue\r\nme any more, they are not pursuing me. . . .\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat I told you is quite true; it was enough to think that you had no\r\nmore pain for the pain to disappear; _do not think then that it may\r\ncome back or it will come back. . . ._\r\n\r\n(A woman, sotto voice, \"What patience he has! What a wonderfully\r\npainstaking man!\")\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nALL THAT WE THINK BECOMES TRUE FOR US.  WE MUST\r\nNOT THEN ALLOW OURSELVES TO THINK WRONGLY.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTHINK \"MY TROUBLE IS GOING AWAY,\" JUST AS YOU\r\nTHINK YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR HANDS.\r\n\r\nThe more you say: _\"I will not,\"_ the more surely the contrary\r\ncomes about. You must say: _\"It's going away,\"_ and think it. Close\r\nyour hand and think properly: \"Now I cannot open it.\" Try! (she\r\ncannot), you see that your will is not much good to you.\r\n\r\n_Observation.--This is the essential point of the method._ In order to\r\nmake auto-suggestions, you must eliminate the _will_ completely\r\nand only address yourself to the _imagination,_ so as to avoid a\r\nconflict between them in which the will would be vanquished.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo become stronger as one becomes older seems paradoxical, but it\r\nis true.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor diabetes: Continue to use therapeutic treatments; I am quite\r\nwilling to make suggestions to you, but I cannot promise to cure you.\r\n\r\n_Observation._--I have seen diabetes completely cured several\r\ntimes, and what is still more extraordinary, the albumen diminish\r\nand even disappear from the urine of certain patients.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis obsession must be a real nightmare. The people you used to\r\ndetest are becoming your friends, you like them and they like you.\r\n\r\nAh, but to _will_ and to _desire_ is not the _same_ thing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThen, after having asked them to close their eyes, M. Coué gives to\r\nhis patients the little suggestive discourse which is to be found in\r\n\"Self Mastery.\" When this is over, he again addresses himself to\r\neach one separately, saying to each a few words on his case:\r\n\r\nTo the first: \"You, Monsieur, are in pain, but I tell you that, from\r\nto-day, the cause of this pain whether it is called arthritis or anything\r\nelse, is going to disappear with the help of your unconscious, and\r\nthe cause having disappeared, the pain will gradually become less\r\nand less, and in a short time it will be nothing but a moment.\"\r\n\r\nTo the second person: \"Your stomach does not function properly, it\r\nis more or less dilated. Well, as I told you just now, your digestive\r\nfunctions are going to work better and better, and I add that the\r\ndilatation of the stomach is going to disappear little by little. Your\r\norganism is going to give back progressively to your stomach the\r\nforce and elasticity it had lost, and by degrees as this phenomenon is\r\nproduced, the stomach will return to its primitive form and will\r\ncarry out more and more easily the necessary movements to pass\r\ninto the intestine the nourishment it contains. At the same time the\r\npouch formed by the relaxed stomach will diminish in size, the\r\nnutriment will not longer stagnate in this pouch, and in consequence\r\nthe fermentation set up will end by totally disappearing.\"\r\n\r\nTo the third: \"To you, Mademoiselle, I say that whatever lesions you\r\nmay have in your liver, your organism is doing what is necessary to\r\nmake the lesions disappear every day, and by degrees as they heal\r\nover, the symptoms from which you suffer will go on lessening and\r\ndisappearing. Your liver then functions in a more and more normal\r\nway, the bile it secretes is alcaline and no longer acid, in the right\r\nquantity and quality, so that it passes naturally into the intestines and\r\nhelps intestinal digestion.\"\r\n\r\nTo the fourth: \"My child, you hear what I say; every time you feel\r\nyou are going to have an attack, you will hear my voice telling you\r\nas quick as lightning: 'No, no! my friend, you are not going to have\r\nthat attack, and it is going to disappear before it comes. . . .'\"\r\n\r\nTo the fifth, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhen everyone has been attended to, M. Coué tells those present to\r\nopen their eyes, and adds: \"You have heard the advice I have just\r\ngiven you. Well, to transform it into reality, what you must do is this:\r\n_As long as you live,_ every morning before getting up, and every\r\nevening as soon as you are in bed, you must shut your eyes, so as to\r\nconcentrate your attention, and repeat twenty times following,\r\nmoving your _lips_ (that is indispensable) and counting\r\n_mechanically_ on a string with twenty knots in it the following\r\nphrase: _'Every day, in every respect, I am getting better and\r\nbetter.'\"_\r\n\r\nThere is no need to think of anything in particular, as the words _\"in\r\nevery respect\"_ apply to everything. This autosuggestion must be\r\nmade with confidence, with faith, with the certainty of obtaining\r\nwhat is desired. The greater the conviction of the person, the greater\r\nand the more rapid will be the results obtained.\r\n\r\nFurther, every time that in the course of the day or night you feel\r\nany physical or mental discomfort, _affirm_ to yourself that you will\r\nnot consciously contribute to it, and that you are going to make it\r\nvanish; then isolate yourself as much as possible, and passing your\r\nhand over your forehead if it is something mental, or on whatever\r\npart that is painful if it is something physical, repeat _very quickly,_\r\nmoving the lips, the words: \"It is going, it is going . . ., etc., etc.\" as\r\nlong as it is necessary. With a little practice, the mental or physical\r\ndiscomfort will disappear in about 20 to 25 seconds. Begin again\r\nevery time it is necessary.\r\n\r\nFor this as for the other autosuggestions it is necessary to act with\r\nthe same confidence, the same conviction, the same faith, and above\r\nall without effort.\r\n\r\nM. Coué also adds what follows: \"If you formerly allowed yourself\r\nto make bad autosuggestions because you did it unconsciously, now\r\nthat you know what I have just taught you, you must no longer let\r\nthis happen. And if, in spite of all, you still do it, you must only\r\naccuse yourself, and say _'Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.'\"_\r\n\r\nAnd now, if a grateful admirer of the work and of the founder of the\r\nmethod may be allowed to say a few words, I will say. \"Monsieur\r\nCoué shows us luminously that the power to get health and\r\nhappiness is within us: we have indeed received this gift.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, suppressing, first of all, every cause of suffering _created\r\nor encouraged by ourselves,_ then putting into practice the favorite\r\nmaxim of Socrates: \"Know thyself,\" and the advice of Pope: \"That I\r\nmay reject none of the benefits that Thy goodness bestows upon\r\nme,\" let us take possession of the entire benefit of autosuggestion,\r\nlet us become this very day members of the \"Lorraine Society of\r\napplied Psychology;\" let us make members of it those who may be\r\nin our care (it is a good deed to do to them).\r\n\r\nBy this means we shall follow first of all the great movement of the\r\nfuture of which M. E. Coué is the originator (he devotes to it his\r\ndays, his nights, his worldly goods, and refuses to accept . . . but\r\nhush; no more of this! lest his modesty refuses to allow these lines to\r\nbe published without alteration), but above all by this means we\r\nshall know exactly the days and hours of his lectures at Paris, Nancy\r\nand other towns, where he devotedly goes to sow the good seed, and\r\nwhere we can go too to see him, and hear him and consult him\r\npersonally, and with his help awake or stir up in ourselves the\r\npersonal power that everyone of us has received of becoming happy\r\nand well.\r\n\r\nMay I be allowed to add that when M. Coué has charged an entrance\r\nfee for his lectures, they have brought in thousands of francs for the\r\nDisabled and others who have suffered through the war.\r\n\r\nE. Vs----oer.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Entrance is free to the members of the Lorraine Society of\r\napplied Psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM LETTERS ADDRESSED TO M. COUÉ\r\n\r\nThe final results of the English secondary Certificate have only been\r\nposted up these two hours, and I hasten to tell you about it, at least\r\nin so far as it concerns myself. I passed the viva voce _with flying\r\ncolors,_ and scarcely felt a trace of the nervousness which used to\r\ncause me such an intolerable sensation of nausea before the tests.\r\nDuring the latter I was astonished at my own calm, which gave those\r\nwho listened to me the impression of perfect self-possession on my\r\npart. In short, it was just the tests I dreaded most which contributed\r\nmost to my success. The jury placed me Second, and I am infinitely\r\ngrateful to you for help, which undoubtedly gave me an advantage\r\nover the other candidates . . ., etc. (The case is that of a young lady,\r\nwho, on account of excessive nervousness, had failed in 1915. The\r\nnervousness having vanished under the influence of autosuggestion,\r\nshe passed successfully, being-placed 2nd out of more than 200\r\ncompetitors.)\r\n\r\n          Mlle. V----,\r\n     _Schoolmistress, August,_ 1916.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt is with very great pleasure that I write to thank you most sincerely\r\nfor the great benefit I have received from your method. Before I\r\nwent to you I had the greatest difficulty in walking 100 yards,\r\nwithout being out of breath, whereas now I can go miles without\r\nfatigue. Several times a day and quite easily, I am able to walk in 40\r\nminutes from the rue du Bord-de-l'Eau to the rue des Glacis, that is\r\nto say, nearly four kilometers. The asthma from which I suffered has\r\nalmost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nYours most gratefully.\r\n\r\n          Paul Chenot,\r\n     _Rue de Strasbourg,_ 141 _Nancy, Aug.,_ 1917.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you. Thanks to you I can say that I am\r\nalmost entirely cured, and I was only waiting to be so in order to\r\nexpress my gratitude. I was suffering from two varicose ulcers, one\r\non each foot. That on the right foot, which was _as big as my hand,_\r\nis entirely _cured._ It seemed to disappear by magic. For weeks I\r\nhad been confined to my bed, but almost immediately after I\r\nreceived your letter the ulcer healed over so that I could get up. That\r\non the left foot is not yet absolutely healed, but will soon be so.\r\nNight and morning I do, and always shall, recite the prescribed\r\nformula, in which I have entire confidence. I may say also that my\r\nlegs were as hard as a stone and I could not bear the slightest touch.\r\nNow I can press them without the least pain, and I can walk once\r\nmore, which is the greatest joy.\r\n\r\n          Mme. Ligny,\r\n     _Mailleroncourt-Charette (Haute Saône), May,_ 1918.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nN. B.--It is worthy of remark that this lady never saw M. Coué, and\r\nthat it is only thanks to a letter he wrote her on April 15th, that she\r\nobtained the result announced in her letter of May 3rd.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI am writing to express my gratitude, for thanks to you I have\r\nescaped the risk of an operation which is always a very dangerous\r\none. I can say more: you have saved my life, for your method of\r\nautosuggestion has done alone what all the medicines and treatments\r\nordered for the terrible intestinal obstruction from which I suffered\r\nfor 19 days, had failed to do. From the moment when I followed\r\nyour instructions and applied your excellent principles, my functions\r\nhave accomplished themselves quite naturally.\r\n\r\n          Mme. S----,\r\n     _Pont à Mousson, Feb.,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you for my happiness in being cured.\r\nFor more than 15 years I had suffered from attacks of asthma, which\r\ncaused the most painful suffocations every night. Thanks to your\r\nsplendid method, and above all, since I was present at one of your\r\nséances, the attacks have disappeared as if by magic. It is a real\r\nmiracle, for the various doctors who attended me all declared that\r\nthere was no cure for asthma.\r\n\r\n          Mme. V----,\r\n     _Saint-Dié, Feb.,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI am writing to thank you with all my heart for having brought to my\r\nknowledge, a new therapeutic method, a marvellous instrument\r\nwhich seems to act like the magic wand of a fairy, since, thanks to\r\nthe simplest means, it brings about the most extraordinary results.\r\nFrom the first I was extremely interested in your experiments, and\r\nafter my own personal success with your method, I began ardently\r\nto apply it, as I have become an enthusiastic supporter of it.\r\n\r\n          Docteur Vachet,\r\n     _Vincennes, May,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor 8 years I have suffered from prolapse of the uterus. I have used\r\nyour method of autosuggestion for the last five months, and am now\r\ncompletely cured, for which I do not know how to thank you enough.\r\n\r\n          Mme. Soulier,\r\n     _Place du Marchè Toul, May,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI have suffered terribly for 11 years without respite. Every night I\r\nhad attacks of asthma, and suffered also from insomnia and general\r\nweakness which prevented any occupation. Mentally, I was\r\ndepressed, restless, worried, and was inclined to make mountains\r\nout of mole hills. I had followed many treatments without success,\r\nhaving even undergone in Switzerland the removal of the turbinate\r\nbone of the nose without obtaining any relief. In Nov., 1918, I\r\nbecame worse in consequence of a great sorrow. While my husband\r\nwas at Corfu (he was an officer on a warship), I lost our only son in\r\nsix days from influenza. He was a delightful child of ten, who was\r\nthe joy of our life; alone and overwhelmed with sorrow, I\r\nreproached myself bitterly for not having been able to protect and\r\nsave our treasure. I wanted to lose my reason or to die. . . . When my\r\nhusband returned (which was not until February), he took me to a\r\nnew doctor who ordered me various remedies and the waters of\r\nMont-Dore. I spent the month of August in that station, but on my\r\nreturn I had a recurrence of the asthma, and I realized with despair\r\nthat _\"in every respect\"_ I was getting worse and worse. It was then\r\nthat I had the pleasure of meeting you. Without expecting much\r\ngood from it, I must say, I went to your October lectures, and I am\r\nhappy to tell you that by the end of November I was cured. Insomnia,\r\nfeelings of oppression, gloomy thoughts, disappeared as though by\r\nmagic, and I am now well and strong and full of courage. With\r\nphysical health I have recovered my mental equilibrium, and but for\r\nthe ineffaceable wound caused by my child's loss, I could say that I\r\nam perfectly happy. Why did I not meet you before? My child\r\nwould have known a cheerful and courageous mother. Thank you\r\nagain and again, M. Coué.\r\n\r\nYours most gratefully,\r\n\r\n          E. Itier,\r\n     _Rue de Lille, Paris, April,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI can now take up again the struggle I have sustained for 30 years,\r\nand which had exhausted me.\r\n\r\nI found in you last August a wonderful and providential help.\r\nComing home to Lorraine for a few days, ill, and with my heart full\r\nof sorrow, I dreaded the shock which I should feel at the sight of the\r\nruins and distress . . . and went away comforted and in good health. I\r\nwas at the end of my tether, and unfortunately I am not religious. I\r\nlonged to find some one who could help me, and meeting you by\r\nchance at my cousin's house you gave me the very help I sought. I\r\ncan now work in a new spirit, I suggest to my unconscious to\r\nre-establish my physical equilibrium, and I do not doubt that I shall\r\nregain my former good health. A very noticeable improvement has\r\nalready shown itself, and you will better understand my gratitude\r\nwhen I tell you that, suffering from diabetes with a renal\r\ncomplication, I have had several attacks of glaucoma, but my eyes\r\nare now recovering their suppleness. Since then my sight has\r\nbecome almost normal, and my general health has much improved.\r\n\r\n          Mlle.

I have received your kind letter as well as your very interesting\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nI am glad to see that you make a rational connection between hetero\r\nand autosuggestion, and I note particularly the passage in which you\r\nsay that the will must not intervene in autosuggestion. That is what a\r\ngreat number of professors of autosuggestion, unfortunately\r\nincluding a large number of medical men, do not realize at all. I also\r\nthink that an absolute distinction should be established between\r\nautosuggestion and the training of the will.\r\n\r\n          Docteur Van Velsen,\r\n     _Brussels, March,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhat must you think of me? That I have forgotten you? Oh, no, I\r\nassure you that I think of you with the most grateful affection, and I\r\nwish to repeat that your teachings are more and more efficacious; I\r\nnever spend a day without using autosuggestion with increased\r\nsuccess, and I bless you every day, for your method is the true one.\r\nThanks to it, I am assimilating your excellent directions, and am\r\nable to control myself better every day, and I feel that I am\r\n_stronger. . . ._ I am sure that you would find it difficult to recognize\r\nin this woman, so active in spite of her 66 years, the poor creature\r\nwho was so often ailing, and who only began to be well, thanks to\r\nyou and your guidance.

I had\r\nalready read many books on the will, and had quite an arsenal of\r\nformulae, thoughts, aphorisms, etc. Your phrases are conclusive. I\r\ndo not think that ever before have \"compressed tablets of self\r\nconfidence.\"--as I call your healing phrases--been condensed into\r\ntypical formulae in such an intelligent manner.\r\n\r\n          Don Enrique C----,\r\n     _Madrid._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYour pamphlet on \"the self-control\" contains very strong arguments\r\nand very striking examples.

Thanks to your good advice the attacks of nerves to\r\nwhich I was subject, have entirely disappeared, and I am certain that\r\nI am quite cured. Further, I feel myself surrounded by a superior\r\nforce which is an unfaltering guide, and by whose aid I surmount\r\nwith ease the difficulties of life.\r\n\r\n          Mme.

The numerous\r\ndoctors I had consulted declared me incurable, but thanks to you and\r\nto your treatment, I have found with perfect health the conviction\r\nthat I possess the power to keep it.\r\n\r\n          Mme. L. T----,\r\n     _Rue du Laos,_ 4, _Paris._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI want to tell you what excellent results M. Coué's wonderful\r\nmethod has produced in my case, and to express my deep gratitude\r\nfor your valuable help. I have always been anaemic, and have had\r\npoor health, but after my husband's death I became much worse. I\r\nsuffered with my kidneys, I could not stand upright, I also suffered\r\nfrom nervousness and aversions. All that has gone and I am a\r\ndifferent person. I no longer suffer, I have more endurance, and I am\r\nmore cheerful. My friends hardly recognize me, and I feel a new\r\nwoman. I intend to spread the news of this wonderful method, so\r\nclear, so simple, so beneficent, and to continue to get from it the best\r\nresults for myself as well.\r\n\r\n          M. L. D----,\r\n     _Paris, June,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI cannot find words to thank you for teaching me your good method.\r\nWhat happiness you have brought to me! I thank God who led me to\r\nmake your acquaintance, for you have entirely transformed my life.\r\nFormerly I suffered terribly at each monthly period and was obliged\r\nto lie in bed. Now all is quite regular and painless. It is the same\r\nwith my digestion, and I am no longer obliged to live on milk as I\r\nused, and I have no more pain, which is a joy. My husband is\r\nastonished to find that when I travel I have no more headaches,\r\nwhereas before I was always taking tablets. Now, thanks to you, I\r\nneed no remedies at all, but I do not forget to repeat 20 times\r\nmorning and evening, the phrase you taught me: \"Every day, in\r\nevery respect, I am getting better and better.\"\r\n\r\n          B. P----,\r\n     _Paris, October,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn re-reading the method I find it more and more superior to all the\r\ndevelopments inspired by it. It surpasses all that has been invented\r\nof so-called scientific systems, themselves based on the uncertain\r\nresults of an uncertain science, which feels its way and deceives\r\nitself, and of which the means of observation are also fairly\r\nprecarious in spite of what the learned say, M. Coué, on the other\r\nhand, suffices for everything, goes straight to the aim, attains it with\r\ncertainty and in freeing his patient carries generosity and knowledge\r\nto its highest point, since he leaves to the patient himself the merit of\r\nthis freedom, and the use of a marvellous power. No, really, there is\r\nnothing to alter in this method. It is as you so strikingly say: a\r\nGospel. To report faithfully his acts and words and spread his\r\nmethod, that is what must be done, and what I shall do myself as far\r\nas is in any way possible.\r\n\r\n          P. C.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI am amazed at the results that I have obtained and continue to\r\nobtain daily, by the use of the excellent method you have taught me\r\nof conscious autosuggestion. I was ill mentally and physically. Now\r\nI am well and am also nearly always cheerful. That is to say that my\r\ndepression has given way to cheerfulness, and certainly I do not\r\ncomplain of the change, for it is very preferable, I assure you. How\r\nwretched I used to be! I could digest nothing; now I digest perfectly\r\nwell and the intestines act naturally. I also used to sleep so badly,\r\nwhereas now the nights are not long enough; I could not work, but\r\nnow I am able to work hard. Of all my ailments nothing is left but an\r\noccasional touch of rheumatism, which I feel sure will disappear like\r\nthe rest by continuing your good method. I cannot find words to\r\nexpress my deep gratitude to you.\r\n\r\n          Mme. Friry,\r\n     _Boulevard Malesherbes, Paris._\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM LETTERS\r\n_Addressed to Mlle. Kaufmant, Disciple of M. Coué_\r\n\r\nAs I have been feeling better and better since following the method\r\nof autosuggestion which you taught me, I feel I owe you the\r\nsincerest thanks, I am now qualified to speak of the great and\r\nundeniable advantages of this method, as to it alone I owe my\r\nrecovery. I had a lesion in the lungs which caused me to spit blood. I\r\nsuffered from lack of appetite, daily vomiting, loss of flesh, and\r\nobstinate constipation. The spitting of blood, lessened at once and\r\nsoon entirely disappeared. The vomiting ceased, the constipation no\r\nlonger exists, I have got back my appetite, and in two months I have\r\ngained nearly a stone in weight. In the face of such results observed,\r\nnot only by parents and friends, but also by the doctor who has been\r\nattending me for several months, it is impossible to deny the good\r\neffect of autosuggestion and not to declare openly that it is to your\r\nmethod that I owe my return to life. I authorize you to publish my\r\nname if it is likely to be of service to others, and I beg you to believe\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYours most gratefully.\r\n\r\n          Jeanne Gilli,\r\n     15, _Av. Borriglione, Nice, March,_ 1918.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI consider it a duty to tell you how grateful I am to you for\r\nacquainting me with the benefits of autosuggestion. Thanks to you, I\r\nno longer suffer from those agonizing and frequent heart stoppages,\r\nand I have regained my appetite which I had lost for months. Still\r\nmore, as a hospital nurse, I must thank you from my heart for the\r\nalmost miraculous recovery of one of my patients, seriously ill with\r\ntuberculosis, which caused him to vomit blood constantly and\r\ncopiously. His family and myself were very anxious when heaven\r\nsent you to him. After your first visit the spitting of blood ceased,\r\nhis appetite returned, and after a few more visits made by you to his\r\nsick bed, all the organs little by little resumed their normal functions.\r\nAt last one day we had the pleasant surprise and joy of seeing him\r\narrive at your private séance, where, before those present, he himself\r\nmade the declaration of his cure, due to your kind intervention.\r\nThank you with all my heart.\r\n\r\nYours gratefully and sympathetically,\r\n\r\n          A. Kettner,\r\n     26, _Av. Borriglione, Nice, March,_ 1918.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n. . . From day to day I have put off writing to you to thank you for\r\nthe cure of my little Sylvain. I was in despair, the doctors telling me\r\nthat there was nothing more to be done but to try the sanitorium of\r\nArcachon or Juicoot, near Dunkirk. I was going to do so when Mine.\r\nCollard advised me to go and see you. I hesitated, as I felt sceptical\r\nabout it; but I now have the proof of your skill, for Sylvain has\r\ncompletely recovered. His appetite is good, his pimples and his\r\nglands are completely cured, and what is still more extraordinary,\r\nsince the first time that we went to see you he has not coughed any\r\nmore, not even once; the result is, that since the month of June he\r\nhas gained 6 lbs.; I can never thank you enough and I proclaim to\r\neveryone the benefits we have received.\r\n\r\n          Mme. Poirson,\r\n     _Liverdun, August,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHow can I prove to you my deep gratitude? You have saved my life.\r\nI had a displaced heart, which caused terrible attacks of suffocation,\r\nwhich went on continually; in fact they were so violent that I had no\r\nrest day or night, in spite of daily injections of morphia. I could eat\r\nnothing without instant vomiting. I had violent pains in the head\r\nwhich became all swollen, and as a result I lost my sight. I was in a\r\nlamentable state and my whole organism suffered from it. I had\r\nabscesses on the liver. The doctor despaired of me after having tried\r\neverything; blood letting, cupping and scarifying, poultices, ice, and\r\nevery possible remedy, without any improvement. I had recourse to\r\nyour kindness on the doctor's advice.\r\n\r\nAfter your first visits the attacks became less violent and less\r\nfrequent, and soon disappeared completely. The bad and troubled\r\nnights became calmer, until I was able to sleep the whole night\r\nthrough without waking. The pains I had in the liver ceased\r\ncompletely. I could begin to take my food again, digesting it\r\nperfectly well, and I again experienced the feeling of hunger which I\r\nhad not known for months. My headaches ceased, and my eyes,\r\nwhich had troubled me so much, are quite cured, since I am now\r\nable to occupy myself with a little manual work.\r\n\r\nAt each visit that you paid me, I felt that my organs were resuming\r\ntheir natural functions. I was not the only one to observe it, for the\r\ndoctor who came to see me every week found me much better, and\r\nfinally there came recovery, since I could get up after having been in\r\nbed eleven months. I got up without any discomfort, not even the\r\nleast giddiness, and in a fortnight I could go out. It is indeed thanks\r\nto you that I am cured, for the doctor says that for all that the\r\nmedicines did me, I might just as well have taken none.\r\n\r\nAfter having been given up by two doctors who held out no hope of\r\ncure, here I am cured all the same, and it is indeed a complete cure,\r\nfor now I can eat meat, and I eat a pound of bread every day. How\r\ncan I thank you, for I repeat, it is thanks to the suggestion you taught\r\nme that I owe my life.\r\n\r\n          Jeanne Grosjean,\r\n     _Nancy, Nov.,_ 1920.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n. . . Personally the science of autosuggestion--for I consider it as\r\nentirely a _science--_has rendered me great services; but truth\r\ncompels me to declare that if I continue to interest myself\r\nparticularly in it, it is because I find in it the means of exercising\r\ntrue charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 when I was present for the first time at M. Coué's lectures, I\r\nconfess that I was entirely sceptical. Before facts a _hundred times_\r\nrepeated in my presence, I was obliged to surrender to evidence, and\r\nrecognize that autosuggestion always acted, though naturally in\r\ndifferent degrees, on organic diseases. The only cases (and those\r\nwere very rare) in which I have seen it fail are nervous cases,\r\nneurasthenia or imaginary illness.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to tell you again that M. Coué, like yourself, but\r\neven more strongly, insists on this point: \"that he never performs a\r\nmiracle or cures anybody, but that he shows people how to cure\r\nthemselves.\" I confess that on this point I still remain a trifle\r\nincredulous, for if M. Coué does not actually cure people, he is a\r\npowerful aid to their recovery, in \"giving heart\" to the sick, in\r\nteaching them never to despair, in uplifting them, in leading them . . .\r\nhigher than themselves into moral spheres that the majority of\r\nhumanity, plunged in materialism, has never reached.\r\n\r\nThe more I study autosuggestion, the better I understand the divine\r\nlaw of confidence and love that Christ preached us: \"Thou shalt love\r\nthy neighbor\" and by giving a little of one's heart and of one's moral\r\nforce to help him to rise if he has fallen and to cure himself if he is\r\nill. Here also from my Christian point of view, is the application of\r\nautosuggestion which I consider as a beneficial and comforting\r\nscience which helps us to understand that as the children of God, we\r\nall have within us forces whose existence we did not suspect, which\r\nproperly directed, serve to elevate us morally and to heal us\r\nphysically.\r\n\r\nThose who do not know your science, or who only know it\r\nimperfectly, should not judge it without having seen the results it\r\ngives and the good it does. Believe me to be your faithful admirer.\r\n\r\n          M. L.

J. Rousseau in that town.\r\n\r\nThis work, published by the firm of Delachaux and Niestle, 26, rue\r\nSaint-Dominique, Paris, is called: \"Suggestion et Autosuggestion\".\r\nThe author has dedicated it: _\"To Emile Coué, the initiator and\r\nbenefactor, with deep gratitude\"._\r\n\r\nI read it and did not put down the book until I had reached the end.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that it contains the very simple exposition of a\r\nmagnificently humanitarian work, founded on a theory which may\r\nappear childish just because it is within the scope of everyone. And\r\nif everyone puts it into practice, the greatest good will proceed from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter more than twenty years of indefatigable work, Emile Coué\r\nwho at the present time lives at Nancy, where he lately followed the\r\nwork and experiments of Liébault, the father of the doctrine of\r\nsuggestions, for more than twenty years, I say, Coué has been\r\noccupied exclusively with this question, but particularly in order to\r\nbring his fellow creatures to cultivate _autosuggestion._\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century Coué had attained the object of his\r\nresearches, and had disengaged the general and immense force of\r\nautosuggestion. After innumerable experiments on thousands of\r\nsubjects, _he showed the action of the unconscious in organic\r\ncases._ This is new, and the great merit of this profoundly, modest\r\nlearned man, is to have found a remedy for terrible ills, reputed\r\nincurable or terribly painful, without any hope of relief.\r\n\r\nAs I cannot enter here into long scientific details I will content\r\nmyself by saying how the learned man of Nancy practises his\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe chiselled epitome of a whole life of patient researches and of\r\nceaseless observations, is a brief formula which is to be repeated\r\nmorning and evening.\r\n\r\nIt must be said in a low voice, with the eyes closed, in a position\r\nfavourable to the relaxing of the muscular system, it may be in bed,\r\nor it may be in an easy chair, and in a tone of voice as if one were\r\nreciting a litany.\r\n\r\nHere are the magic words: _\"Every day, in every respect, I am\r\ngetting better and better\"._\r\n\r\nThey must be said twenty times following, with the help of a string\r\nwith twenty knots in it, which serves as a rosary. This material detail\r\nhas its importance; it ensures mechanical recitation, which is\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nWhile articulating these words, _which are registered by the\r\nunconscious,_ one must not think of anything particular, neither of\r\none's illness nor of one's troubles, one must be passive, just with the\r\ndesire that all may be for the best. The formula _\"in every respect\"_\r\nhas a general effect.\r\n\r\nThis desire must be expressed without passion, without will, with\r\ngentleness, _but with absolute confidence._\r\n\r\nFor Emile Coué at the moment of autosuggestion, _does not call in\r\nthe will in any way, on the contrary;_ there must be no question of\r\nthe will at that moment, but the _imagination,_ the great motive\r\nforce infinitely more active than that which is usually invoked, the\r\nimagination alone must be brought into play.\r\n\r\n\"Have confidence in yourself,\" says this good counsellor, \"believe\r\nfirmly that all will be well\". And indeed all is well for those who\r\nhave faith, fortified by perseverance.\r\n\r\nAs deeds talk louder than words, I will tell you what happened to\r\nmyself before I had ever seen M. Coué.\r\n\r\nI must go back then to the month of September when I opened M.\r\nCharles Baudouin's volume. At the end of a substantial exposition,\r\nthe author enumerates the cure of illnesses such as enteritis, eczema,\r\nstammering, dumbness, a sinus dating from twenty years back which\r\nhad necessitated eleven operations, metritis, salpingitis, fibrous\r\ntumours, varicose veins, etc., lastly and above all, deep tubercular\r\nsores, and the last stages of phthisis (case of Mme. D----, of Troyes,\r\naged 30 years, who has become a mother since her cure; case was\r\nfollowed up, but there was no relapse). All this is often testified to\r\nby doctors in attendance on the patients.\r\n\r\nThese examples impressed me profoundly; _there_ was the miracle.\r\nIt was not a question of nerves, but of ills which medicine attacks\r\nwithout success. This cure of tuberculosis was a revelation to me.\r\n\r\nHaving suffered for two years from acute neuritis in the face, I was\r\nin horrible pain. Four doctors, two of them specialists, had\r\npronounced the sentence which would be enough, of itself alone, to\r\nincrease the trouble by its fatal influence on the mind: \"Nothing to\r\nbe done!\" This \"nothing to be done\" had been for me the worst of\r\nautosuggestions.\r\n\r\nIn possession of the formula: \"Every day, in every respect . . .\", etc., I\r\nrecited it with a faith which, although it had come suddenly, was\r\nnone the less capable of removing mountains, and throwing down\r\nshawls and scarves, bareheaded, I went into the garden in the rain\r\nand wind repeating gently _\"I am going to be cured,_ I shall have no\r\nmore neuritis, it is going away, it will not come back, etc. . . .\" The\r\nnext day I was cured and never any more since have I suffered from\r\nthis abominable complaint, which did not allow me to take a step out\r\nof doors and made life unbearable. It was an immense joy. The\r\nincredulous will say: \"It was all nervous.\" Obviously, and I give\r\nthem this first point. But, delighted with the result, I tried the Coué\r\nMethod for an oedema of the left ankle, resulting from an affection\r\nof the kidneys reputed incurable. In two days the oedema had\r\ndisappeared. I then treated fatigue and mental depression, etc., and\r\nextraordinary improvement was produced, and I had but one idea: to\r\ngo to Nancy to thank my benefactor.\r\n\r\nI went there and found the excellent man, attractive by his goodness\r\nand simplicity, who has become my friend.\r\n\r\nIt was indispensable to see him in his field of action. He invited me\r\nto a popular \"séance.\" I heard a concert of gratitude. Lesions in the\r\nlungs, displaced organs, asthma, Pott's disease (!), paralysis, the\r\nwhole deadly horde of diseases were being put to flight. I saw a\r\nparalytic, who sat contorted and twisted in his chair, get up and walk.\r\nM. Coué had spoken, he demanded confidence, great, immense\r\nconfidence in oneself. He said: \"Learn to cure yourselves, you can\r\ndo so; I have never cured anyone. The power is within you\r\nyourselves, call upon your spirit, make it act for your physical and\r\nmental good, and it will come, it will cure you, you will be strong\r\nand happy\". Having spoken, Coué approached the paralytic: \"You\r\nheard what I said, do you believe that you will walk?\" \"Yes.\"--\"Very\r\nwell then, get up!\" The woman got up, she walked, and went round\r\nthe garden. The miracle was accomplished.\r\n\r\nA young girl with Pott's disease, whose vertebral column became\r\nstraight again after three visits, told me what an intense happiness it\r\nwas to feel herself coming back to life after having thought herself a\r\nhopeless case.\r\n\r\nThree women, cured of lesions in the lungs, expressed their delight\r\nat going back to work and to a normal life. Coué in the midst of\r\nthose people whom he loves, seemed to me a being apart, for this\r\nman ignores money, all his work is gratuitous, and his extraordinary\r\ndisinterestedness forbids his taking a farthing for it. \"I owe you\r\nsomething\", I said to him, \"I simply owe you everything. . . .\" \"No,\r\nonly the pleasure I shall have from your continuing to keep well. . . .\"\r\n\r\nAn irresistible sympathy attracts one to this simple-minded\r\nphilanthropist; arm in arm we walked round the kitchen garden\r\nwhich he cultivates himself, getting up early to do so. Practically a\r\nvegetarian, he considers with satisfaction the results of his work.\r\nAnd then the serious conversation goes on: \"In your _mind_ you\r\npossess an _unlimited_ power. It acts on matter if we know how to\r\ndomesticate it. The imagination is like a horse without a bridle; if\r\nsuch a horse is pulling the carriage in which you are, he may do all\r\nsorts of foolish things and take you to your death. But harness him\r\nproperly, drive him with a sure hand, and he will go wherever you\r\nlike. Thus it is with the mind, the imagination. They must be\r\ndirected for our own good. Autosuggestion, formulated with the lips,\r\nis an order which the unconscious receives, it carries it out unknown\r\nto ourselves and above all at night, so that the evening\r\nautosuggestion is the most important. It gives marvelous results.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you feel a physical pain, add the formula _\"It is going\r\naway . . .\",_ very quickly repeated, in a kind of droning voice,\r\nplacing your hand on the part where you feel the pain, or on the\r\nforehead, if it is a mental distress.\r\n\r\nFor the method acts very efficaciously on the mind. After having\r\ncalled in the help of the soul for the body, one can ask it again for all\r\nthe circumstances and difficulties of life.\r\n\r\nThere also I know from experience that events can be singularly\r\nmodified by this process.\r\n\r\nYou know it to-day, and you will know it better still by reading M.\r\nBaudouin's book, and then his pamphlet: _\"Culture de la force\r\nmorale\",_ and then, lastly, the little succinct treatise written by M.\r\nCoué himself: _\"Self Mastery.\"_ All these works may be found at M.\r\nCoué's.\r\n\r\nIf however I have been able to inspire in you the desire of making\r\nthis excellent pilgrimage yourself, you will go to Nancy to fetch the\r\nbooklet. Like myself you will love this unique man, unique by\r\nreason of his noble charity and of his love for his fellows, as Christ\r\ntaught it.\r\n\r\nLike myself also, you will be cured physically and mentally. Life\r\nwill seem to you better and more beautiful. That surely is worth the\r\ntrouble of trying for.\r\n\r\n          M. Burnat-Provins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NOTES ON THE JOURNEY OF M. COUÉ TO PARIS IN\r\nOCTOBER, 1919\r\n\r\nThe desire that the teachings of M. Coué in Paris last October should\r\nnot be lost to others, has urged me to write them down. Putting aside\r\nthis time the numerous people, physically or mentally ill, who have\r\nseen their troubles lessen and disappear as the result of his\r\nbeneficent treatment, let us begin by quoting just a few of his\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\n_Question._--Why is it that I do not obtain better results although I\r\nuse your method and prayer?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Because, probably, at the back of your mind there is an\r\n_unconscious doubt,_ or because you make _efforts._ Now,\r\nremember that efforts are determined by the will; if you bring the\r\nwill into play, you run a serious risk of bringing the imagination into\r\nplay too, but in the contrary direction, which brings about just the\r\nreverse of what you desire.\r\n\r\n_Question._--What are we to do when something troubles us?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--When something happens that troubles you, _repeat_ at\r\nonce \"No, that does not trouble me at all, not in the least, the fact is\r\nrather agreeable than otherwise.\" In short, the idea is to work\r\nourselves up in a good sense instead of in a bad.\r\n\r\n_Question._--Are the preliminary experiments indispensable if they\r\nare unacceptable to the pride of the subject?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--No, they are not indispensable, but they are of great\r\nutility; for although they may seem childish to certain people, they\r\nare on the contrary extremely serious; they do indeed prove three\r\nthings:\r\n\r\n1. That every idea that we have in our minds becomes _true_ for us,\r\nand has a tendency to transform itself into action.\r\n\r\n2. That when there is a conflict between the imagination and the will,\r\nit is always the imagination which wins; and in this case we do\r\nexactly the _contrary_ of what we wish to do.\r\n\r\n3. That it is easy for us to put into our minds, _without any effort,_\r\nthe idea that we wish to have, since we have been able without effort\r\nto think in succession: \"I cannot,\" and then \"I can.\"\r\n\r\nThe preliminary experiments should not be repeated at home; alone,\r\none is often unable to put oneself in the right physical and mental\r\nconditions, there is a risk of failure, and in this case one's\r\nself-confidence is shaken.\r\n\r\n_Question._--When one is in pain, one cannot help thinking of one's\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Do not be afraid to think of it; on the contrary, do think\r\nof it, but to say to it, \"I am not _afraid_ of you.\"\r\n\r\nIf you go anywhere and a dog rushes at you barking, look it firmly\r\nin the eyes and it will not bite you; but if you fear it, if you turn back,\r\nhe will soon have his teeth in your legs.\r\n\r\n_Question._--And if one does a retreat?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Go backwards.\r\n\r\n_Question._--How can we realize what we desire?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--By often repeating what you desire: \"I am gaining\r\nassurance,\" and you will do so; \"My memory is improving,\" and it\r\nreally does so; \"I am becoming absolutely master of myself,\" and\r\nyou find that you are becoming so.\r\n\r\nIf you say the contrary, it is the contrary which will come about.\r\n\r\nWhat you say persistently and very quickly _comes to pass_ (within\r\nthe domain of the reasonable, of course).\r\n\r\nSome testimonies:\r\n\r\nA young lady to another lady: \"How simple it is! There is nothing to\r\nadd to it: he seems inspired. Do you not think that there are beings\r\nwho radiate influence?\"\r\n\r\n. . . An eminent Parisian doctor to numerous doctors surrounding\r\nhim: \"I have entirely come over to the ideas of M. Coué.\"\r\n\r\n. . . A Polytechnician, a severe critic, thus defines M. Coué: \"He is a\r\nPower.\"\r\n\r\n. . . Yes, he is a Power of Goodness. Without mercy for the bad\r\nautosuggestions of the \"defeatist\" type, but indefatigably painstaking,\r\nactive and smiling, to help everyone to develop their personality,\r\nand to teach them to cure themselves, which is the characteristic of\r\nhis beneficent method.\r\n\r\nHow could one fail to desire from the depths of one's heart that all\r\nmight understand and seize the \"good news\" that M. Coué brings?\r\n\"It is the awakening, possible for everyone, of the personal power\r\nwhich he has _received_ of being happy and well.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, _if one consents,_ the full development of this power which\r\ncan transform one's life.\r\n\r\nThen, and is it not quite rightly so? it is the strict duty (and at the\r\nsame time the happiness) of those who have been initiated, to spread\r\nby every possible means the knowledge of this wonderful method,\r\nthe happy results of which have been recognized and verified by\r\n_thousands_ of persons, to make it known to those who suffer, who\r\nare sad, or who are overburdened . . . to all! and to help them to put it\r\ninto practice.\r\n\r\nThen, thinking of France, triumphant but bruised, of her defenders\r\nvictorious but mutilated, of all the physical and moral suffering\r\nentailed by the war; may those who-have the power (the greatest\r\npower ever given to man is the power of doing good [Socrates]) see\r\nthat the inexhaustible reservoir of physical and moral forces that the\r\n\"Method\" puts within our reach may soon become the-patrimony of\r\nall the nation and through it of humanity.\r\n\r\nMme. Emile Leon,\r\n_Collaborator, in Paris, of M. Emile Coué_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE\"\r\n\r\nBy Mme. Emile Leon, Disciple of M. Coué.\r\n\r\nWhen one has been able to take advantage of a great benefit; when\r\nthis benefit is within reach of everyone, although almost everyone is\r\nignorant of it, is it not an urgent and absolute duty (for those who are\r\ninitiated) to make it known to those around them? For all can make\r\ntheir own the amazing results of the \"Emile Coué Method.\"\r\n\r\nTo drive away pain is much . . . but how much more is it to lead into\r\nthe possession of a new life _all_ those who suffer. . . .\r\n\r\nLast April we had the visit of M. Emile Coué at Paris, and here are\r\nsome of his teachings:\r\n\r\n_Question._--Question of a theist: I think it is unworthy of the\r\nEternal to make our obedience to his will, depend on what M. Coué\r\ncalls a trick or mechanical process: conscious autosuggestion.\r\n\r\n_M. Coué._--Whether we wish it or not, our imagination always\r\noverrules our will, when they are in conflict. We can lead it into the\r\nright path indicated by our reason, by _consciously_ employing the\r\nmechanical process that we employ _unconsciously_ often to lead\r\ninto the wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd the thoughtful questioner says to herself: \"Yes, it is true, in this\r\nelevated sphere of thought, conscious autosuggestion has the power\r\nto free us from obstacles _created by ourselves,_ which might as it\r\nwere put a veil between us and God, just as a piece of stuff, hanging\r\nin a window, can prevent the sun from coming into a room.\"\r\n\r\n_Question._--How ought one to set about bringing those dear to one\r\nwho may be suffering, to make themselves good autosuggestions\r\nwhich would set them free?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Do not insist or lecture them about it. Just remind them\r\nsimply that I advise them to make an autosuggestion with the\r\n_conviction_ that they will obtain the result they want.\r\n\r\n_Question._--How is one to explain to oneself and to explain to\r\nothers that the repetition of the same words: \"I am going to sleep. . . .\r\nIt is going away . . .\" etc., has the power to produce the effect, and\r\nabove all so powerful an effect that it is a certain one?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The repetition of the same words forces one to think\r\nthem, and when we think them they become true for us and\r\ntransform themselves into reality.\r\n\r\n_Question._--How is one to keep inwardly the mastery of oneself?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--To be master of oneself it is enough to think that one is\r\nso, and in order to think it, one should often repeat it without making\r\nany effort.\r\n\r\n_Question._--And outwardly, how is one to keep one's liberty?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--Self mastery applies just as much physically as\r\nmentally.\r\n\r\n_Question_(Affirmation).--It is impossible to escape trouble or\r\nsadness, if we do not do as we should, it would not be just, and\r\nautosuggestion, cannot . . . and ought not to prevent _just suffering._\r\n\r\n_M. Coué_(very seriously and affirmatively).--Certainly and\r\nassuredly it ought not to be so, but it is so often . . . at any rate for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Question._--Why did that patient who has been entirely cured,\r\ncontinually have those terrible attacks?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--He expected his attacks, he feared them . . . and so he\r\n_provoked_ them; if this gentleman gets well into his mind the idea\r\nthat he will have no more attacks, he will not have any; if he thinks\r\nthat he will have them, he will indeed do so.\r\n\r\n_Question._--In what does your method differ from others.\r\n\r\n_Answer._--The differ not the _will_ which rules us but the\r\n_imagination;_ that is the basis, the fundamental basis.\r\n\r\n_Question._--Will you give me a summary of your \"Method\" for\r\nMme. R----, who is doing an important work?\r\n\r\n_M. E. Coué._--Here is the summary of the \"Method\" in a few\r\nwords: Contrary to what is taught, it is not our will which makes us\r\nact, but our imagination (the unconscious). If we often do act as we\r\n_will,_ it is because at the same time we think that we can. If it is\r\nnot so, we do exactly the reverse of what we wish. Ex: The more a\r\nperson with insomnia _determines_ to sleep, the more excited she\r\nbecomes; the more we _try_ to remember a name which we think\r\nwe have forgotten, the more it escapes us (it comes back only if, in\r\nyour mind, you replace the idea: \"I have forgotten\", by the idea \"it\r\nwill come back\"); the more we strive to prevent ourselves from\r\nlaughing, the more our laughter bursts out; the more we _determine_\r\nto avoid an obstacle, when learning to bicycle, the more we rush\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nWe must then apply ourselves to directing our _imagination_ which\r\nnow directs us; in this way we easily arrive at becoming masters of\r\nourselves physically and morally.\r\n\r\nHow are we to arrive at this result? By the practice of conscious\r\n_autosuggestion._\r\n\r\nConscious autosuggestion is based on this principle. Every idea that\r\nwe have in our mind becomes true for us and tends to realize itself.\r\n\r\nThus, if we _desire_ something, we can obtain it at the end of a\r\nmore or less long time, if we often repeat that this thing is going to\r\ncome, or to disappear, according to whether it is a good quality or a\r\nfault, either physical or mental.\r\n\r\nEverything is included by employing night and morning the general\r\nformula: \"Every day, _in every respect,_ I am getting better and\r\nbetter\".\r\n\r\n_Question._--For those who are sad--who are in distress?\r\n\r\n_Answer._--As long as you think: \"I am sad\", you _cannot_ be\r\ncheerful, and in order to think something, it is enough to say without\r\neffort: \"I do think this thing--\"; as to the distress it will disappear,\r\nhowever violent it may be, _that_ I _can_ affirm.\r\n\r\nA man arrives bent, dragging himself painfully along, leaning on\r\ntwo sticks; he has on his face an expression of dull depression. As\r\nthe hall is filling up, M. E. Coué enters. After having questioned this\r\nman, he says to him something like this: \"So you have had\r\nrheumatism for 32 years and you cannot walk. Don't be afraid, it's\r\nnot going to last as long as that again.\"\r\n\r\nThen after the preliminary experiments: \"Shut your eyes, and repeat\r\nvery quickly indeed, moving your lips, the words: 'It is going, it is\r\ngoing' (at the same time M. Coué passes his hand over the legs of\r\nthe patient, for 20 to 25 seconds). Now you are no longer in pain, get\r\nup and walk (the patient walks) quickly! quicker! more quickly still!\r\nand since you can walk so well, you are going to run; run! Monsieur,\r\nrun!\" The patient runs (joyously, almost as if he had recovered his\r\nyouth), to his great astonishment, and also to that of the numerous\r\npersons present at the séance of April 27th, 1920. (Clinic of Dr.\r\nBerillon.)\r\n\r\nA lady declares: \"My husband suffered from attacks of asthma for\r\nmany years, he had such difficulty in breathing that we feared a fatal\r\nissue; his medical adviser, Dr. X---- had given him up. He was\r\nalmost radically cured of his attacks, after only one visit from M.\r\nCoué\".\r\n\r\nA young woman comes to thank M. Coué with lively gratitude. Her\r\ndoctor, Dr. Vachet, who was with her in the room, says that the\r\ncerebral anaemia from which she had suffered for a long while,\r\nwhich he had not succeeded in checking by the usual means, had\r\ndisappeared as if by magic through the use of conscious\r\nautosuggestion.\r\n\r\nAnother person who had had a fractured leg and could not walk\r\nwithout pain and limping, could at once walk normally. No more\r\npain, no more limping.\r\n\r\nIn the hall which thrills with interest, joyful testimonies break out\r\nfrom numerous persons who have been relieved or cured.\r\n\r\nA doctor: \"Autosuggestion is the weapon of healing\". As to this\r\nphilosopher who writes (he mentions his name), he relies on the\r\n_genius_ of Coué.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, a former magistrate, whom a lady had asked to\r\nexpress his appreciation, exclaims in a moved tone: \"I cannot put my\r\nappreciation into words--I think it is admirable--\" A woman of the\r\nworld, excited by the disappearance of her sufferings: \"Oh, M. Coué,\r\none could kneel to you--You are the merciful God!\" Another lady,\r\nvery much impressed herself, rectifies: \"No, his messenger\".\r\n\r\nAn aged lady: It is delightful, when one is aged and fragile, to\r\nreplace a feeling of general ill health by that of refreshment and\r\ngeneral well-being, and M. E. Coué's method can, I affirm for I have\r\nproved it, produce this happy result, which is all the more complete\r\nand lasting since it relies on the all-powerful force which is within\r\nus.\r\n\r\nA warmly sympathetic voice calls him the modest name he prefers\r\nto that of \"Master\": Professor Coué.\r\n\r\nA young woman who has been entirely won over: \"M. Coué goes\r\nstraight to his aim, attains it with sureness, and, in setting free his\r\npatient, carries generosity and knowledge to its highest point, since\r\nhe leaves to the patient himself the merit of his liberation and the use\r\nof a marvellous power\".\r\n\r\nA literary man, whom a lady asks to write a little _\"chef d'oeuvre\"_\r\non the beneficent \"Method\" refuses absolutely, emphasizing the\r\nsimple words which, used according to the Method, help to make all\r\nsuffering disappear: \"IT IS GOING AWAY--_that_ is the _chef-d'oeuvre!\"_\r\nhe affirms.\r\n\r\nAnd the thousands of sick folks who have been relieved or cured\r\nwill not contradict him.\r\n\r\nA lady who has suffered much declares: \"In re-reading the 'Method'\r\nI find it more and more superior to the developments it has inspired;\r\nthere is really nothing to take away nor add to this 'Method'--all\r\nthat is left is to spread it. I shall do so in every possible way.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now in conclusion I will say: Although M. Coué's modesty\r\nmakes him reply to everyone:\r\n\r\nI have no magnetic fluid--\r\n\r\nI have no influence--\r\n\r\nI have never cured anybody--\r\n\r\nMy disciples obtain the same results as myself--\r\n\r\n\"I can say in all sincerity that they tend to do so, instructed as they\r\nare in the _valuable 'Method',_ and when, in some far distant future,\r\nthe thrilling voice of its author called to a higher sphere can no\r\nlonger teach it here below, the 'Method', his work, will help in\r\naiding, comforting, and curing thousands and thousands of human\r\nbeings: it must be _immortal,_ and communicated to the entire\r\nworld by generous France--for the man of letters was right, and\r\nknew how to illuminate in a word this true simple, and marvellous\r\nhelp in conquering pain: 'IT IS GOING AWAY--! _There is the\r\nchef-d'oeuvre!'\"_\r\n\r\n          B. K. (Emile-Leon).\r\n     Paris, June 6th, 1920.",
