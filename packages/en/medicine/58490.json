Unfortunately for about four of every\r\nfive settlers in the first few years at Jamestown, the best was not\r\nenough to avert wholesale mortality from sickness, Indian arrows, and\r\n“meere famine.” That some of the medical men shared the fate of their\r\npatients seems likely in the absence of later information about most of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMedical theories and practices at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury were largely those that had prevailed since the time of Galen, a\r\nGreek physician who died about two centuries after Christ. According to\r\nGalen, the four elements of Aristotelian science—fire, water, air, and\r\nearth—comprised the four major humors of the human body: blood, phlegm,\r\nyellow bile, and black bile. Blood was held to be moist and warm, phlegm\r\nwas moist and cool, yellow bile dry and warm, and black bile dry and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nSickness, in the theory of Galen, was caused by one or more of these\r\nhumors becoming impure or out of place or out of balance. Treatment thus\r\nconsisted of removing or diminishing the offending humor by purging,\r\nbleeding, vomiting, blistering, urinating, sweating, or salivating; on\r\nthe other hand, a deficient humor was to be restored by diet and drugs.\r\nGalen classed drugs according to their warm, cold, moist, or dry\r\nqualities. For instance, pepper was a heating drug, good for chills,\r\nwhile cucumber was a cool one, to be given in case of fever.\r\n\r\nGalenism had been subjected to attack in the sixteenth century by\r\nParacelsus and Vesalius, but its appeal was logical and remained strong\r\nin seventeenth-century England. (In fact, some survivals can be found in\r\ntwentieth-century folk medicine.) Dr. Lawrence Bohun (or Boone), who\r\ncame over in 1610 and returned to England in 1611, spent some of the\r\nyear investigating medicinal sources in Virginia. He discovered a white\r\nclay—and shipped some to England—that he claimed could absorb and expel\r\npoisons from the body. Among vegetable remedies, Bohun experimented with\r\nsassafras and found “_Galbanum mechoacon_, otherwise called _rubarbum\r\nalum_, to be of service in cold moist bodies, for the purginge of fleame\r\n[phlegm] and superfluous matter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _WHAT IS AN APOTHECARY?_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready it will be evident that the practice of medicine in\r\nseventeenth-century England, and hence in the first American colonies,\r\nwas not neatly confined to the licensed graduates of accredited medical\r\nschools. Quite the contrary. In fact, Henry VIII had complained that all\r\nkinds of ignorant people got into the act, including “Smiths, Weavers,\r\nand Women.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In the upper half of this woodcut from _The Expert\r\n    Doctor’s Dispensary_, published in London in 1657, a learned\r\n    physician is shown conducting a urinalysis. He simply holds the\r\n    flask of liquid to the light for visual examination. Below, a\r\n    customer presents what appears to be a written prescription to be\r\n    filled by the apothecary._]\r\n\r\nTwo centuries of legal and parliamentary pulling and hauling, plus the\r\nconsequence of some natural developments, left the situation in England\r\nsomewhat stabilized—but not necessarily logical. The barbers, chartered\r\nas a guild in 1462 and authorized to practice surgery, included both\r\nbarbers and surgeons in growing disharmony until they were formally\r\ndivorced in 1745.\r\n\r\nThe apothecaries—the word originally meant shopkeeper—joined the guild\r\nof grocers at one time but shortly broke away to form their own guild in\r\n1617. Meantime, the physicians, organized in the College of Physicians,\r\nobtained the right to keep watch on the apothecaries.\r\n\r\nPhysicians, who had to have as much as 14 years training and four\r\ndegrees from Oxford or Cambridge, were naturally not abundant. Being\r\nlearned men, they would not stoop to the indignity of such menial work\r\nas performing surgical operations or compounding medicines. The former\r\nwas the province of the surgeon or barber-surgeon, the latter was the\r\nspecialty of the apothecary.\r\n\r\nBut the scarcity of physicians, especially in rural areas, left a\r\nmedical gap that the apothecaries, trained through apprenticeship and\r\nmany times more numerous, naturally moved to fill. In 1727 English law\r\nfinally recognized and legalized the fact that for most people the\r\napothecary-surgeon was the only available practitioner of medicine. In\r\nturn, the business of purveying drugs and compounding medicines passed\r\nfrom the apothecaries to the wholesale druggists and pharmaceutical\r\nchemists.\r\n\r\nAs it was transferred to America the trade of apothecary—it was neither\r\na craft nor a profession in any strict sense—was probably much like that\r\nof the rural apothecary-surgeon of seventeenth-century England. The\r\napothecary still made his living primarily from the provision of drugs\r\nand medical preparations; but he also performed amputations, dressed\r\nwounds, and subjected his patients to the normal medical treatments of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _ALL THAT THE LAW ALLOWS_\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia was the only colony that tried to draw legislative boundaries\r\naround the various aspects of medical practice. The effort came in 1736\r\nin the form of “an Act for Regulating the Fees and Accounts of the\r\nPracticers of Phisic.” On two grounds the act deserves to be quoted at\r\nsome length. For one thing, it throws a good light on the state of\r\nmedical practice at that time. For another, it affords undeniable\r\nparallels to some current problems in the cost of medicines and medical\r\ncare, and to the role of government in serving the interests of the\r\n“consumer.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _An eighteenth-century operating chair, fully\r\n    equipped with tilting back, padded adjustable supports, and straps\r\n    to keep the patient from writhing away from the knife. Anesthesia\r\n    was limited to strong doses of spirituous liquors; antisepsis was\r\n    unknown.  The illustration is taken from Denis Diderot’s famous\r\n    encyclopedia of arts and sciences._]\r\n\r\nThe first section of the act recited certain abuses, especially of the\r\nsurgeons and apothecaries:\r\n\r\n  I. Whereas the practice of phisic in this colony, is most commonly\r\n  taken up and followed, by surgeons, apothecaries, or such as have only\r\n  served apprenticeships to those trades, who often prove very unskilful\r\n  in the art of a phisician; and yet do demand excessive fees, and exact\r\n  unreasonable prices for the medicines which they administer, and do\r\n  too often, for the sake of making up long and expensive bills, load\r\n  their patients with greater quantities thereof, than are necessary or\r\n  useful, concealing all their compositions, as well to prevent the\r\n  discovery of their practice, as of the true value of what they\r\n  administer: which is become a grievance, dangerous and intolerable, as\r\n  well to the poorer sort of people as others, & doth require the most\r\n  effectual remedy that the nature of the thing will admit.\r\n\r\nThe second section then proceeded to emphasize the chief distinction\r\nbetween the apprentice-trained apothecary-surgeons and the\r\nuniversity-educated physicians by allowing the latter to charge twice as\r\nmuch for their services as the former could. If the apothecaries and\r\nsurgeons felt—as well they might have—that the difference in fees was an\r\ninsult to them, it did not last long. The law was not renewed at the\r\nfollowing session of the Assembly; perhaps its backers, the physicians,\r\nhad seen their patients flock to the lower-priced practicers.\r\n\r\nAlthough Virginia was the only colony to set medical fees by law, the\r\npractice of legislative price fixing in other areas of the economy was\r\nas common in colonial America as it was in England. In Virginia, to be\r\nspecific, not only prices and quantities but in some cases even\r\nqualities of goods and services offered to the public by tavernkeepers,\r\nshoemakers, millers, and ferrymen were regulated by law. The economic\r\nphilosophy and terminology of _laissez faire_ were among the alien isms\r\nimported after 1776. During the colonial years, government rarely\r\nhesitated to act in the economic field where the need was felt.\r\n\r\nFrom this particular Virginia law of 1736 it would appear that some if\r\nnot all medical charges had gotten well out of line—the correct line, of\r\ncourse, being what the people and their elected representatives thought\r\nwas reasonable:\r\n\r\n  II. BE it therefore enacted, ...\r\n\r\n  That from and after the passing of this act, no practicer in phisic,\r\n  in any action or suit whatsoever, hereafter to be commenced in any\r\n  court of record in this colony, shall recover, for visiting any sick\r\n  person, more than the rates hereafter mentioned: that is to say,\r\n\r\n  Surgeons and apothecaries, who have served an apprenticeship to those\r\n  trades, shall be allowed,\r\n\r\n                                                                £  s  d\r\n    For every visit, and prescription, in town, or within      00  5 00\r\n        five miles\r\n    For every mile, above five, and under ten                  00  1 00\r\n    For a visit, of ten miles                                  00 10 00\r\n    And for every mile, above ten                              00 00 06\r\n    With an allowance for all ferriages in their journeys.\r\n    To Surgeons, For a simple fracture, and the cure thereof   02 00 00\r\n       For a compound fracture, and the cure thereof           04 00 00\r\n\r\n  But those persons who have studied phisic in any university, and taken\r\n  any degree therein, shall be allowed,\r\n\r\n    For every visit, and prescription, in any town, or within  00 10 00\r\n        five miles\r\n    If above five miles, for every mile more, under ten        00  1 00\r\n    For a visit, if not above ten miles                         1 00 00\r\n    And for every mile, above ten                              00  1 00\r\n    With an allowance of ferriages, as before.\r\n\r\nLest it appear that all Williamsburg “practicers” made a habit of\r\ncharging excessive fees, the generous treatment an earlier doctor gave\r\nat least one of his patients must be set down. George Hume, a Scottish\r\nmerchant who came to Virginia about 1722 and soon caught all the\r\nprevalent ills, found the place “only good for doctors and ministers who\r\nhave very good encouragem’nt here.” One of the “common distempers” that\r\nafflicted Hume was dysentery, then called the flux. He was laid so low\r\nthat Dr. John Brown all but despaired of his life. Hume’s gratitude for\r\nbeing cured was doubtless enhanced by the fact—carefully reported to his\r\nScottish relatives—that “ye Dr. took nothing for my druggs.”\r\n\r\nThe third section of the act, specifying exactly what the “practicer of\r\nphisic” should set forth in his bill, bears if least a faint augury of\r\nmodern food-and-drug labeling legislation:\r\n\r\n  III. And to the end the true value of the medicines administered by\r\n  any practicer in phisic, may be better known, and judged of, _Be it\r\n  further enacted, by the authority aforesaid_, That whenever any pills,\r\n  bolus, portion, draught, electuary, decoction, or any medicines, in\r\n  any form whatsoever, shall be administered to any sick person, the\r\n  person administering the same shall, at the same time, deliver in his\r\n  bill, expressing every particular thing made up therein; or if the\r\n  medicine administered, be a simple, or compound, directed in the\r\n  _dispensatories_, the true name thereof shall be expressed in the same\r\n  bill, together with the quantities and prices, in both cases. And in\r\n  failure thereof, such practicer, or any apothecary, making up the\r\n  prescription of another, shall be nonsuited, in any action or suit\r\n  hereafter commenced, which shall be grounded upon such bill or bills:\r\n  Nor shall any book, or account, of any practicer in phisic, or any\r\n  apothecary, be permitted to be given in evidence, before a court;\r\n  unless the articles therein contained, be charged according to the\r\n  directions of this act.\r\n\r\nThis final section reveals that some differentiation between the\r\nbranches of the medical profession had already begun in America. The\r\ntip-off is the phrase that imposes on “any apothecary making up the\r\nprescription of another” the same requirements as on physicians who make\r\nup their own prescriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _THE DOCTORS OF WILLIAMSBURG_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf competition tends to keep prices low, fees charged in and around the\r\ncapital city in the early eighteenth century should have been at the\r\nrock bottom level. Governor Gooch in 1729 reported to London that\r\nWilliamsburg abounded in physicians. The same year young Adam Cunningham\r\ngave up his brief effort to establish himself in practice as a doctor:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Another illustration from the Diderot encyclopedia\r\n    shows the operation of trepanning a skull and some surgical tools in\r\n    common use in the eighteenth century, in colonial America as well as\r\n    in Europe._]\r\n\r\n  Williamsburg [he wrote] is but a small Village containing not more\r\n  than 60 families, at most; and in and about this City are no less than\r\n  25 or 30 phisitians, and of that number not above 2 capable of living\r\n  handsomly. So that I did not think it proper to stay, in a place where\r\n  so many of my profession are lickely to starve.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about any of these “phisitians,” not even the names of\r\nmost. It seems fairly sure, however, that a number were quacks. Gooch\r\nhad complained in the same letter about the “unskilfulness of\r\npractioners in this country” but was gullible enough himself to pay 60\r\npounds from public funds and give freedom to a Negro slave for the\r\nsecret of the latter’s alleged cure of venereal diseases. It turned out\r\nto be a decoction of roots and barks, which the Governor avowed to be “a\r\ncertain Remedy here” and sent samples so the College of Physicians could\r\ntry its effect in England.\r\n\r\nMost of Gooch’s abundant physicians almost certainly made up their own\r\nprescriptions. From 1622 at Jamestown until 1731 in Williamsburg no\r\nmention of an apothecary in Virginia has been found in historical\r\nrecords. In the latter year, however, there were four shops purveying\r\ndrugs and compounding medicines in Williamsburg. The proprietors of two\r\nwere doctors—Dr. George Gilmer and Dr. Kenneth McKenzie; the other two\r\nwere druggists or “chymists”—Thomas Wharton and Thomas Goodwin.\r\n\r\nGoodwin did not remain independent long. After about two years he joined\r\nDr. Robert Davidson, mayor of Williamsburg, in a partnership that was\r\nitself dissolved in two years by the death of Dr. Davidson. Thomas\r\nWharton, on the other hand, kept shop in Williamsburg for some eleven\r\nyears. He had arrived in Virginia about 1703 as an indentured servant to\r\na Dr. Richard Wright and had acquired by the time of his death in 1746\r\nnot only a pharmaceutical business, but the title of “Doctor.” He willed\r\nhis drugs, medicines, and shop utensils to Dr. McKenzie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _SHOPKEEPER EXTRAORDINARY_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth named practicer, George Gilmer, Sr., deserves extended\r\nattention. He comes as close as any one person to being a typical\r\nWilliamsburg apothecary-surgeon-physician of his time, though his\r\nextramedical career was far from typical.\r\n\r\nBorn in Edinburgh in 1700, Gilmer studied medicine there, then practiced\r\nwith one of London’s leading doctors, whose daughter he married.\r\nPossibly the death of his young wife moved him to ship for America; at\r\nthe age of 31 he arrived in Virginia to practice medicine and manage the\r\naffairs of a land company. He married again and must have prospered,\r\nbecause in four years’ time he was able to purchase for £155 three\r\nchoice lots near the Governor’s Palace in Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nThese three lots, on which the rambling St. George Tucker House has\r\nstood since 1788, were described in 1735 as “the Lotts and Land whereon\r\nthe Bowling Green formerly was, the Dwelling House and Kitchen of\r\nWilliam Levingston and the House call’d the Play House.” The last, of\r\ncourse, was the first theater in the English colonies, and Gilmer later\r\nsold it to the mayor and aldermen of Williamsburg to be used as a city\r\nhall and courthouse. It was a particularly convenient arrangement for\r\none of the aldermen who was to become mayor himself a year later, none\r\nother than Dr. George Gilmer.\r\n\r\nGilmer’s career as an apothecary-surgeon-physician was not without its\r\nups and downs. Soon after buying the property on Palace Green, he was\r\ngiving away samples of rattlesnake root on behalf of Dr. John Tennent,\r\nwho maintained it would cure pleurisy, the gout, rheumatism, and mad-dog\r\nbites.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the _Virginia Gazette_, Williamsburg’s new weekly,\r\ncarried the news that “on _Monday_ Morning last, dy’d, at Mr. _Geo.\r\nGilmer’s_, in this City, Mrs. _Susanna Skaife_, ... and was decently\r\ninterr’d on _Wensday_. And, on _Thursday_ Morning also dy’d, the Rev.\r\nMr. _John Skaife_, her Husband, after a tedious Indisposition.” It would\r\nappear that at least Mrs. Skaife was a bed patient in Dr. Gilmer’s home;\r\nthis was a usual way of caring for serious illnesses before the day of\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Surrounded by the equipment of his craft, this young\r\n    apothecary is making up a prescription of some kind, probably for\r\n    pills. The illustration traces back to a London publication, _The\r\n    Book of Trades or Library of Useful Arts_, first American edition\r\n    published in 1807 by J. Johnson and for sale in his bookstore in\r\n    Philadelphia and in Richmond, Virginia._]\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, Gilmer found it necessary to insert the following\r\nadvertisement in the _Virginia Gazette_:\r\n\r\n                                            Williamsburg _May_ 26, 1737.\r\n\r\n  _There being a Report industriously spread about the Country, of\r\n  _George Gilmer’s_ Death, by some well-meaning People, and of his being\r\n  so much in Debt, that nothing from _England_ would be sent him this\r\n  Year, _if alive_._\r\n\r\n  _To obviate such scandalous and groundless _Reports_, I take this\r\n  Opportunity to acquaint all my Friends, that I can now, better than\r\n  ever, supply them with all manner of Chymical and Galenical Medicines,\r\n  truly and faithfully prepared, and at as cheap Rates as can be had\r\n  from _England_. Also Double-refin’d, Single refin’d, and Lump Sugars,\r\n  Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, _Bateman’s_ Drops, _Squire’s_ Elixir,\r\n  _Anderson’s_ Pills, Sweet Oil, _&c._ at reasonable Rates; at my Old\r\n  Shop, near the _Governor’s_._\r\n\r\n                                                           George Gilmer\r\n\r\nNine years later Gilmer was so much alive and active as to be mayor of\r\nthe city, the owner of a new four-wheeled chaise, and once more a\r\nbridegroom. On the death of his second wife, Gilmer had promptly married\r\nhis next-door neighbor. The third Mrs. Gilmer was Harrison Blair,\r\ndaughter of Dr. Archibald Blair and sister of the Hon. John Blair of the\r\ngovernor’s council. The apothecary’s star was rising.\r\n\r\nHe was still, of course, a shopkeeper. His “Old Shop near the\r\nGovernor’s” stood at the very edge of Palace Green, a frame building of\r\nabout 20 feet square. Every year or so he advertised the arrival from\r\nEngland of a shipment of drugs, medicines, spices, and groceries—to be\r\nsold at the shop, wholesale or retail, and at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\nArchaeological excavations on the site of the first theater, and\r\nextending north of it onto the adjacent Brush-Everard House property,\r\nyielded quantities of Dr. Gilmer’s domestic and pharmaceutical rubbish.\r\nThe latter included delftware ointment pots and drug jars, glass\r\nmedicine phials and fragments of carboys, bottles for Pyrmont mineral\r\nwater, a brass pestle, and, inexplicably, a human jaw. Just how, or if,\r\nthat related to Gilmer’s shop remains open to conjecture, but it is\r\nevident from the quantity of pharmaceutical artifacts recovered that Dr.\r\nGilmer’s business was as extensive as his 1737 advertisement claimed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Gilmer was no ordinary shopkeeper. His social status—doubtless\r\nbolstered by that of his wife’s family—was great enough that he could be\r\namong the first to entertain the newly appointed Governor Dinwiddie. One\r\nsuspects that either the ambitious Dr. Gilmer or his well-born wife\r\ndecided that his house on Palace Street fell short of such prestigious\r\ndemands. Six months after the dinner for Dinwiddie, the apothecary was\r\nhaving his dining room wainscoted, with a marble fireplace, a mirror\r\nover the mantel, and a cabinet to contain the set of new china his wife\r\nhad ordered from London.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Dr. Gilmer, who gave himself perhaps facetiously the\r\ntitle of “colonel,” became part owner of the Raleigh Tavern. The deed by\r\nwhich he and Colonel Chiswell bought the famous inn for £700 testified\r\nthat he had gained that ultimate accolade of social and economic status\r\nin colonial Virginia, the designation “Geo Gilmer Gent.”\r\n\r\nIn the letters he wrote to London, Gilmer seems to refer to himself not\r\nas a doctor or surgeon, but as an apothecary, and his name in public\r\ndocuments as well as in private records most often appears not as Dr.\r\nGilmer but as Mr. Gilmer. He was doubtless prouder of being known as a\r\ngentleman and a colonel; the title of doctor was often held in poor\r\nesteem. William Byrd II wrote in 1706 that “here be some men indeed that\r\nare call’d Doctors: but they are generally discarded Surgeons of Ships,\r\nthat know nothing above the very common Remedys.” As late as 1783 Dr.\r\nJohann Schoepf, writing of his travels through the former colonies,\r\nasserted that “in America every man who drives the curing trade is known\r\nwithout distinction as Doctor, as elsewhere every person who makes\r\nverses is a poet—so there are both black doctors and brown, and quacks\r\nin abundance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _THE EDUCATION OF AN APOTHECARY_\r\n\r\n\r\nApprenticeship was the usual form of training for all colonial\r\noccupations, with the possible exception of the ministry at one end of\r\nthe scale and ordinary farming at the other. Medicine was not an\r\nexception; practitioners normally took apprentices for the same reasons\r\nthat cabinetmakers or blacksmiths did. The beginning apprentice\r\nperformed the unskilled and some of the semiskilled duties of the\r\nestablishment, learning as he did so. As he acquired knowledge, he could\r\ngive the doctor more and more assistance in his practice.\r\n\r\nThe doctor generally undertook, if there was a formal indenture, to\r\nteach the apprentice the “art and mystery of physic, surgery, and\r\npharmacy,” or words to that effect. Sometimes, however, he agreed to\r\nteach only the art of the apothecary. In either event, the apprentice\r\nwas taught to compound medicines as directed by his master, to search\r\nthe woods for medicinal plants, and probably to keep books and collect\r\nfees. Even an apprentice apothecary might in time be called on to\r\nassist—or perhaps even take over—such routine treatments as bleeding.\r\nMost likely he also had to spend his evenings reading whatever medical\r\nor pharmaceutical works the doctor had on hand—from Hippocrates to the\r\nlatest edition of the _Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia_.\r\n\r\nOn completing this apprenticeship—which in most cases probably fell\r\nshort of the English norm of seven years—the young man could set up in\r\nthe “curing trade”, for himself, with no more credentials than his\r\nmaster’s certificate to the effect that he had served a certain term and\r\nhad studied certain books. Or he could go to Edinburgh or London for\r\nfurther study at a university or in a hospital.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Another plate from Diderot’s encyclopedia shows a\r\n    variety of instruments used by eighteenth-century\r\n    apothecary-surgeons. Notice the box-like device with 16 small knives\r\n    that can be pressed against the skin and triggered to make\r\n    simultaneous incisions for bleeding a patient. One of these gadgets\r\n    can be seen at the Apothecary Shop in Williamsburg._]\r\n\r\nIn any event, there was no requirement that a dealer in drugs or a\r\npracticer of medicine must have a degree, a license, or any other\r\nrecommendation than his own assurance of good results to the sick who\r\napplied to him. Some practitioners were on the modest side in offering\r\ntheir services; some were wholly unrestrained—even guaranteeing to cure\r\ncancer! The contrast stands out sharply in these two advertisements from\r\nthe _Virginia Gazette_, the first in 1771 by Dr. William Stark of the\r\ntown of Blandford, the second five years later by a quack who did not\r\neven bother to give himself the title of doctor.\r\n\r\n  The Subscriber having been bred to Physick in his younger Years, and\r\n  having attended particularly to this Study for these three Years past,\r\n  now proposes to practise on the most moderate Terms. He cannot with\r\n  Sincerity boast of having attained the _Ne plus ultra_ of the\r\n  _Aesculapian_ Art, nor yet of acquiring any superior Degree of\r\n  Knowledge in this Science; but flatters himself that, by a vigilant\r\n  and due Attention to the Indications and Efforts of Nature in those\r\n  sick Persons who should, through Choice or Necessity, be committed to\r\n  his Care, he may be able to afford them proper and timely Assistance.\r\n\r\n                                    * * *\r\n\r\n  Thomas Johnson, of Brunswick, Who is well known for his Abilities in\r\n  the Cure of the Flux, gives Notice that he also cures the following\r\n  Disorders, _viz._ the Spleen, Cholic, Asthma, and any Kind of Fevers,\r\n  lingering Disorders, bad Coughs, Scurvy, any Kind of running Humours\r\n  or scorbutic Disorders, the Yaws and _French_ Disorder, without\r\n  Salivation, sore Legs, Dropsy, Scurvy in the Gums, and has the\r\n  greatest Reason to believe he can cure the Consumption if timely\r\n  applied to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _LINES OF SUCCESSION_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a very direct and personal way, each generation of Williamsburg\r\nphysician-apothecary trained its successor. Two particularly\r\nillustrative lines began with Dr. George Gilmer.\r\n\r\nAt one time in 1745 it appears that Gilmer had an apprentice by the name\r\nof James Carter. A few years later Carter opened an apothecary shop of\r\nhis own at the sign of the Unicorn’s Horn, next door to the Raleigh\r\nTavern in Williamsburg. Carter in turn took Andrew Anderson as\r\napprentice, and in due time when Anderson had attain the status of\r\n“doctor,” took him into partnership. This combination lasted only two\r\nyears, and James Carter later formed a partnership with his brother\r\nWilliam, a physician. After another few years James sold his share of\r\nthe apothecary shop to William but apparently continued independently to\r\npractice medicine until his death in 1794.\r\n\r\nGilmer, of course, had long since taken another apprentice in young\r\nJames Carter’s place. Billy Pasteur was the son of the barber and\r\nwigmaker, who could not afford to send his son abroad for medical study.\r\nBut at the end of his apprenticeship, Pasteur did go to London with the\r\nhelp of Dr. Gilmer for a year’s study at St. Thomas’s Hospital. He\r\nreturned to Williamsburg and opened shop just after his benefactor’s\r\ndeath. It would seem probable that he took over Gilmer’s shop before\r\nbuilding his own, though the record does not say.\r\n\r\nPasteur, in his own turn, had at least two apprentices who later\r\npracticed in Williamsburg. The second, Robert Nicolson, shortly moved\r\nhis apothecary shop and medical practice to Yorktown, thereby taking\r\nhimself out of this narrative. His predecessor, John Minson Galt,\r\nremained in Williamsburg and in the medical profession until 1808. Like\r\nDr. Gilmer, who educated his own son, George Gilmer, Jr., in medicine,\r\nJohn Minson Galt launched two of his sons into medicine via\r\napprenticeship.\r\n\r\nA son of Samuel Galt, the silversmith, John Minson Galt was apprenticed\r\nat the age of 14 to William Pasteur, who himself had just set up shop\r\nand was only half a dozen years older. The apprenticeship appears to\r\nhave lasted a full term of seven years. It was followed by two years of\r\nmedicine in London. There the young man studied the theory and practice\r\nof physic under Dr. Hugh Smith, midwifery under Dr. Colin McKenzie, and\r\nsurgery, anatomy, and operations at St. Thomas’s Hospital. Galt is also\r\nsaid to have attended the College of William and Mary—presumably before\r\ngoing abroad—and to have pursued his medical studies in Edinburgh and\r\nParis as well as in London. All of this made John Minson Galt\r\nundoubtedly the best educated apothecary-surgeon of eighteenth-century\r\nWilliamsburg.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Williamsburg in 1769 he bought “a box of Surgeon’s\r\nInstruments,” married Judith Craig, and announced his intention to open\r\nshop at “the Brick House, opposite the Coffee House when he gets his\r\nutensils fixed.” The _Virginia Gazette_’s notice of the marriage was\r\nshort and full of confident optimism:\r\n\r\n  This evening Doctor JOHN MINSON GALT, of this city, was married to\r\n  Miss JUDITH CRAIG, eldest daughter of Mr. ALEXANDER CRAIG. The mutual\r\n  affection and familiarity of disposition in this agreeable pair,\r\n  afford the strongest assurance of their enjoying the highest felicity\r\n  in the nuptial state.\r\n\r\nIn setting up shop as an apothecary-surgeon in Williamsburg, Galt was\r\nnot exactly filling a vacuum. In fact, the same issue of the _Gazette_\r\nin which he announced himself carried long advertisements by two other\r\napothecaries. One was Galt’s former master and benefactor, William\r\nPasteur; the other was “Andrew Anderson, Surgeon and Man-Midwife,” also\r\njust launching in practice. Altogether the ads occupy a little over one\r\nwhole column of the paper, and each consists almost solely of a list of\r\nthe items available at that shop.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that William Pasteur had imported a new\r\nsupply of goods in the same ship with Galt’s “compleat assortment,” and\r\njust in time:\r\n\r\n  The subscriber having had but very few medicines left in his shop\r\n  before this order came to hand, will now be able to furnish his\r\n  friends and customers with every thing fresh and genuine. Gentlemen\r\n  practitioners, and others, may depend on being supplied at a very low\r\n  advance.\r\n\r\nThe final assurance echoes Pasteur’s earlier complaint written his\r\nLondon agents to the effect that “tiss hardly worth our while to import\r\nmedicines for sale we are Oblige to sell at a low advance on acc^t of\r\nour confounded druggist here....” The “confounded druggist,” William\r\nBiers, was having his own difficulties making a living, however, and\r\nsoon sold out to the partnership of James Carter and Andrew Anderson.\r\n\r\nColonial Williamsburg owns several of Dr. Galt’s account books,\r\nincluding the one for the years 1770 to 1775, before he joined Pasteur.\r\nOne of the early entries shows a charge against Thomas Glass of ten\r\nshillings for “visiting &c.” The corresponding credit entry shows that\r\nthe bill was paid in cash seven years and five months later! Patients\r\nwere as lax about paying their doctor’s bills then as now, and although\r\nmost of Dr. Galt’s patients paid in cash, he also took wood, hay, and\r\noats. On one instance he wrote off a debt with an equal credit “for the\r\nRunaway.”\r\n\r\nWhat is surely the most provocative entry occurs opposite February 29,\r\n1772, a Leap Year Day. On that date appears a debit against a Mr. Bowyer\r\nof 10 shillings for “attend^ce in the night.” On the credit side are\r\nthese words in Galt’s hand: “Twas sewed on by a Girl who I shou’d be\r\nhappy with.” Does this mean that in three short years the “mutual\r\naffection and familiarity of disposition” of John and Judith had worn\r\naway? The account book does not answer.\r\n\r\nNotice that Galt’s charge of 10 shillings for visiting a patient was the\r\nvery sum permitted by law in 1736—three and a half decades earlier. For\r\namputating Mr. Parson’s finger and dressing it he charged £3 4_s_ 6_d_,\r\nand the same amount to Mr. Cardwell for “laying open Child’s leg &c.”\r\n\r\nThere is but a single entry for bleeding, and in this case the patient\r\nwas a Negro. Dr. Galt, unlike most of his colleagues, seems not to have\r\nfavored phlebotomy. The great number of entries simply mention visiting,\r\nattendance, or advice, with prescriptions by the score of cathartics,\r\nemetics, purges, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _PASTEUR & GALT_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been a source of gratification to John Minson Galt when the\r\nwell-established Pasteur invited the younger man to become his partner.\r\nThe announcement of the new firm read as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         WILLIAMSBURG, _April_ 15, 1775.\r\n\r\n  THE Subscribers having this Day entered into Partnership, beg Leave to\r\n  acquaint the Public in general, and their Friends and Neighbours in\r\n  particular, that they intend practicing Physic and Surgery to their\r\n  fullest Extent; and that they intend also, as soon as the Situation of\r\n  the Times will admit, to keep full and complete Assortments of Drugs\r\n  and Medicines, which they will endeavour to procure of the very best\r\n  in Quality, and will take Care to have them fresh by making several\r\n  Importations in the Year. It is proposed that _John M. Galt_ shall pay\r\n  his particular Attention to Surgery, to whom our Friends are desired\r\n  to apply on all such occasions, but will be advised and assisted by\r\n  _W. Pasteur_ in all difficult Cases. They both desire to make their\r\n  most grateful Acknowledgments to their Friends and Customers for the\r\n  many Favours and Civilities they have received, and hope, by this\r\n  Union, they will be enabled to carry on their Business to the entire\r\n  Satisfaction of their Friends; as, on their Part, the strictest\r\n  Assiduity and Attention shall be observed.\r\n\r\n                                                          PASTEUR & GALT\r\n\r\nOnly a few days after this announcement appeared, the spark of\r\nrevolution flared out in both Lexington, Massachusetts, and\r\nWilliamsburg, Virginia. As it happened, Dr. Pasteur was to play a minor\r\nrole and a momentary one on the Williamsburg stage. Governor Dunmore’s\r\nsurreptitious removal of the colony’s gunpowder from the Magazine was\r\ndetected and there was an immediate reaction from the populace, some\r\nunder arms. Attending a patient in the Palace, Dr. Pasteur was twice\r\naccosted by the Governor and made the bearer of angry messages to the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Burgesses and “the Gentlemen of the Town.”\r\nShould he be attacked, His Lordship blustered, “he would declare freedom\r\nto the slaves & reduce the city of Williamsburg to ashes.”\r\n\r\nWhat actually followed was that Dunmore and his family fled the Palace,\r\nnever to return, and Pasteur became the next mayor of Williamsburg. It\r\nshould be mentioned that he and John Minson Galt were already members of\r\nthe Committee of Safety for the city when they formed their partnership.\r\nThe sympathies of both were clearly on the patriot side.\r\n\r\nThe partners very shortly were able to advertise the importation of the\r\nusual wide assortment of drugs and medicines for sale in their shop on\r\nDuke of Gloucester Street. And a few surviving bills indicate that they\r\ndid not lack for medical and surgical business. Dr. Pasteur, it would\r\nseem, did not share his younger colleague’s aversion to phlebotomy, as\r\nthe following excerpt from a Pasteur & Galt bill to Henry Morse Esq. in\r\n1775 shows:\r\n\r\n  April  14  To bleeding Vomit & Chamomile Flowers       . . 7 . . 6\r\n         21  To Brimstone & Antimony                     . . 1 . . 3\r\n         22  To Purge Honey & Barley                     . . 4 . .\r\n         25  To Purge 2/6. 26 Sugar Candy 1/3            . . 3 . . 9\r\n         29  To bleeding & Pectoral Mixture              . . 8 . . 6\r\n         30  To Visiting Mixture & Sago                  . . 9 . . 9\r\n  May     4  To Pectoral Mixture                         . . 6 . . 6\r\n         11  To 1 lb Balsam Honey                        . . 6 . . 3\r\n         19  To 1 lb D_o_. 6/3 25 Honey 1/0\r\n                31_st_ Cons.

Galt, on the other hand, continued to\r\npractice medicine, serving as a senior surgeon to the Continental\r\nmilitary hospital in Williamsburg, joining in partnership with Dr.\r\nPhilip Barraud, and becoming visiting physician to the public hospital\r\nfor the insane and a member of its board of directors. He held both\r\noffices until his death in 1808. Yet as late as 1794 he was identified\r\nin court records as “Apothecary, of the City of Williamsburg.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE APOTHECARY SHOP_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur-Galt apothecary shop on Duke of Gloucester Street in\r\nWilliamsburg is a reconstruction. Its size and location are determined\r\nwith certainty not only from an eighteenth-century town map, but also by\r\neighteenth-century foundations excavated on the site. The land was owned\r\nby Dr. William Pasteur from 1760 until 1778, during which time he\r\nprobably built the shop. When he and John Minson Galt dissolved their\r\npartnership, he sold the property to Galt, who transferred it to his son\r\nat the end of the century.\r\n\r\nNo record survives as to the exact appearance, outside or inside, of the\r\nPasteur-Galt shop. Some apothecary shops apparently had as many as three\r\nrooms: the front shop, the doctor’s office and operating room, and\r\npossibly a sort of laboratory where the apprentice compounded medicines.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur-Galt shop has been reconstructed with two, the preparative\r\nwork being done in full view of the public.\r\n\r\nAs to the content of the shop, ample evidence comes from almost any\r\nadvertisement of Galt, Pasteur, or for that matter of just about any\r\napothecary in colonial America at any time during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. They all published for their prospective customers lengthy\r\nlists of items just imported, and the lists bear a marked resemblance\r\nfrom place to place and from time to time.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Apothecary’s advertisement]\r\n\r\n                    WILLIAMSBURG, _August_ 31, 1769.\r\n                   _Just imported in the_ Experiment,\r\n                            _Capt._ Hamlin,\r\n\r\n  A FRESH and compleat assortment of DRUGS and MEDICINES, chymical and\r\n  galenical, which will be SOLD at very low advance for READY CASH, and\r\n  are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Crude antimony, æther, verdigrease, Barbados, hepatick, and succotrine\r\n  aloes, common and rock alum, ambergrise, compound waters of all kinds,\r\n  quicksilver, balsams of capri, Peru, amber, and Tolu, Canadian balsam,\r\n  Armenian bole, borax, calomel crude and prepared, comphor, camella\r\n  alba, cantharides, cloves, Indian pink, greatly celebrated for\r\n  destroying worms in children, Russian and Hudson’s Bay castors, common\r\n  and lunar caustick, cinnabar of antimony, native and fictitious\r\n  cinnabar, potash, cochineal, colcothar, vitriol, colocynth, confectio\r\n  cardiaca, conserves of hips, sloes, and sorrel roses, wormwood and\r\n  orange peel, Jesuits bark, cinnamon, cascarilla, cremor tartar,\r\n  English and Spanish saffron, claterium, plaisters and electuaries of\r\n  all kinds, essence of lemons, burgamot and ambergrease, single and\r\n  double camomile flowers, flower of brimstone, balaustines, fenna,\r\n  galls, grains of paradise, gums of all kinds, pearl barley, isinglass,\r\n  Irish slate, litharge, common and flakey manna, sweet mercury,\r\n  calcined mercury, corrosive sublimate, red precipitate, musk, chymical\r\n  oils, opium, long pepper, ipecacuanha, jalap, gentian, licorice,\r\n  contrayerva, calamus aromaticus, china and sarsaparilla, best Turkey\r\n  and India rhubarb, valerian, sago, alkaline, neutral, and volatile\r\n  salts, saloop, seeds of anise, carraway, coriander, wild carrot,\r\n  fennel and fennugreek, lesser cardamoms, staves acre, spermaceti,\r\n  spirits of hartshorn, lavender, sal volatile, and sal ammoniac, nitre,\r\n  mineral acids, dulcified spirits of salt, vitriol, and sal ammoniac,\r\n  Spanish licorice, tartar emetic, vermacelli, white, blue, and green\r\n  vitriols, extract of hemlock, glass of antimony, meadow, saffron, and\r\n  mezereon roots, common and Nesbitt’s clyster pipes, gold and silver\r\n  leaf, Dutch metal, gallipots and vials, Anderson’s, Hooper’s, and\r\n  Lockyer’s pills, Turlington’s balsam, Hill’s pectoral balsam of honey,\r\n  Bateman’s drops, Squire’s, Daffy’s, and Bostock’s elixirs, Freeman’s\r\n  and Godfrey’s cordials British oil, eau de luce, Dr. James’s fever\r\n  powder, court plaister, best lavender and Hungary water, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  The subscriber intends opening shop at the BRICK HOUSE, opposite the\r\n  Coffee-House, when he gets his utensils fixed, which will be in a\r\n  fortnight at farthest; and as this is his first importation, every\r\n  thing may be depended upon as entirely fresh, and bought of one of the\r\n  best hands in _London_.

According to Turlington, the bottle was\r\n    adopted in 1754 “to prevent the villainy of some persons who, buying\r\n    up my empty bottles, have basely and wickedly put therein a vile\r\n    spurious counterfeit sort.”_]\r\n\r\n                                 LONDON\r\n                 By The Kings Royall Patent Granted to\r\n\r\n                             JANU^Y 26 1754\r\n           Rob.^t Turlington For His Invented Balsam of Life\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the Galt or any other advertisement of the time shows that\r\nthe contents of a colonial apothecary shop fell into five categories:\r\nplant materials, animal extracts, metals and metallic derivatives,\r\nmedical equipment, and prepared elixirs, pills, and the like.\r\n\r\nAmong the most popular of the prepared medicines—judging from the many\r\nadvertisements of Dr. John Minson Galt in the years 1772-1774—were Dr.\r\nKeyser’s celebrated anti-venereal pills. These were backed by\r\ntestimonials of two English and three French dukes, and Galt published\r\nlengthy accounts avowing that “the Patient is most effectually cured\r\nwithout any Inconvenience to himself, or being exposed to the Shame and\r\nConfusion of his Disaster being known to the nicest Observer.”\r\n\r\nNot only were they supposed to cure syphilis, but “the happy effects of\r\n_Keyser’s_ pills have often been proved in white Swellings, asthmas,\r\nSuppressions of the Urine, in the Palsy, Apoplexies, Sciaticks, in the\r\nGreen Sickness, and more especially in the Yaws.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Rednapp’s red fit drops” were among Dr. Pasteur’s favorite patent\r\nmedicines, and Daffy’s, Stoughton’s, and Bateman’s elixirs or drops were\r\ndistributed not only by most colonial apothecaries but also by the\r\nkeepers of general stores, ship captains, and others. In 1771 no fewer\r\nthan nineteen packaged English medicines were offered for sale at the\r\nPost Office in Williamsburg!\r\n\r\nThe formulas for some of these, consisting of twenty or more separate\r\ningredients, were printed in the principal pharmacopoeias and were\r\ncommonly made up by doctors and apothecaries for their own use and for\r\nsale. Dr. Pasteur and Dr. James Carter both ordered quantities of empty\r\nbottles for Stoughton’s and Daffy’s compounds.\r\n\r\nDependence on imported patent medicines was a development that several\r\nobservers deplored. Dr. Schoepf, for instance, thought American\r\nphysicians should patriotically discontinue “making use almost wholly of\r\nforeign medicines, with which in large measure they might easily\r\ndispense, if they were willing to give their attention to home-products,\r\ninforming themselves more exactly of the properties and uses of the\r\nstock of domestic medicines already known.”\r\n\r\nJefferson in his _Notes on the State of Virginia_ had listed twenty-one\r\nmedicinal plants native to the state, and others before him had\r\ncommented on the abundance of simple remedies afforded by the woods and\r\nmarshes of tidewater Virginia. Indeed, it appears that colonial medical\r\nmen in the seventeenth century had gathered the largest part of their\r\nown medicines close at hand, and that the growing importation of patent\r\nmixtures was matched by an increasing export of native drugs.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century considerable quantities of at\r\nleast eight medicinal plants were being shipped to England from\r\nVirginia, among them ipecacuanha, sassafras, balsam of Tolu, ginseng,\r\nand snakeroot. The last two formed the bulk of the export; of them more\r\nin a moment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Seneca rattlesnake root or _Polygala Virginiana_ was\r\n    a mainstay of medical treatment in eighteenth-century Virginia. The\r\n    original source of this drawing has not been identified._]\r\n\r\nHowever, if there were in colonial towns “some apothecaries shops\r\nwainscotted or papered with advertisements, recommending quack\r\nmedicines,” a large number of rural practitioners preferred to make up\r\ntheir remedies. “I do not apply to the Apothecaries Shops for my Means,”\r\nsaid the advertisement of one such, “I compact my own medicines myself.\r\nThe produce of _Virginia_ Earth, with a few trifles besides, supports my\r\nBody, ... and many others besides, without bleeding, sweating,\r\nphysicking, or Bitters.”\r\n\r\nWhether used from conviction that such means were better, or because the\r\nimported medicines were too expensive, the result was the same: such\r\nmild cures were less likely to interfere with the healing course of\r\nnature than did the complex, often drastic, and sometimes revolting\r\ncompounds of the leading English physicians.\r\n\r\nFrom inventories of the estates of deceased apothecaries as well as from\r\ntheir newspaper advertisements comes evidence as to the equipment they\r\nkept and used in their shops. The remarkable thing is to see how little\r\nthe essential items have changed over the course of the centuries—alike\r\nbefore and since the colonial era.\r\n\r\nThe mortar and pestle, traditional symbol of the apothecary’s calling\r\nand often used as the sign of his shop, was to be found in Williamsburg\r\nshops in many sizes and materials. The largest recorded was a bell-metal\r\nmortar and iron pestle belonging to Dr. Thomas Wharton and weighing 168\r\npounds. Wharton also owned a large marble mortar and pestle, two small\r\nones of marble, and a “Porphrey Stone & Muller.” Later in the century,\r\nas the medical profession learned that toxic quantities of metal dust\r\ncould come from the use of metal mortars, ceramic and glass became\r\nwidely used.\r\n\r\nGlass and ceramic containers by the hundreds were also used to store\r\nsimple ingredients and compounds for sale. Dr. Pasteur at one time, for\r\ninstance, ordered 246 white glass vials ranging in capacity from two\r\ndrams to twelve ounces. Dr. Alexander Middleton, whose tory sympathies\r\ncost him his Williamsburg shop and contents during the Revolution,\r\nlisted more than fifty dozen bottles, from one ounce size to two\r\ngallons, along with dozens of pill pots, ointment pots, and syrup pots.\r\nGlass seems to have been the most common type of container, with\r\nearthenware “gallipots” probably second.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles with which the Williamsburg shop is furnished are a\r\nnumber that belonged to the first Dr. Galt that have been obtained from\r\nhis descendants or generously loaned by them to Colonial Williamsburg.\r\nThe largest is the secretary-bookcase that stands in the back office,\r\nthe most numerous are the scores of glass bottles and cardboard\r\npillboxes that cluster on one section of the shelves, and perhaps the\r\nmost interesting are his diplomas in anatomy, surgery, and midwifery\r\nthat hang on the wall. Vying with the last name is the account book\r\ndisplaying a charge of 7 shillings against Patrick Henry—but no entry to\r\nshow that the bill was ever paid.\r\n\r\nIt would require more space than is here available to describe, or even\r\nto list, all the articles in the shop today, and to identify all the\r\ndrugs, herbs, powders, and compounds that would have been contained in\r\nthe numerous bottles, jars, boxes, and drawers of the shop. The quantity\r\nand variety, however, may be taken as typical of a well provided\r\napothecary shop of colonial America.\r\n\r\nOne should note in particular the surgical instruments in their\r\nvelvet-lined cases. These have been collected from various\r\nsources—including one case of lancets and a set of scales from the Galt\r\nfamily—and are of the period. Dr. Alexander Middleton claimed to have\r\nbeen deprived in the Revolution of instruments for amputating,\r\ntrepanning, lithotomy, cupping, couching, dissecting, dentistry, and\r\nmidwifery. The estate of Dr. Kenneth McKenzie of Williamsburg\r\ninventoried three sets of instruments for amputating, trepanning, and\r\nlithotomy.\r\n\r\nThe McKenzie inventory also listed the medical books in Dr. McKenzie’s\r\nlibrary. There were more than seventy titles, of which all but a few\r\nwere medical treatises, some of them in several volumes. Among them were\r\nlisted _James’ Dispensatory_ and _Shaw’s Dispensatory_. These, along\r\nwith _Bate’s Dispensatory_ and the _London Dispensatory_ were among the\r\nmost widely read, owned, and used books in the colony, and not alone by\r\ndoctors or apothecaries. One or more was almost certain to be in the\r\nlibrary of every planter of tidewater Virginia, a kind of “What to do\r\ntill the Doctor comes” manual for the home treatment of the planter\r\nhimself, his wife and children, his relatives and neighbors, and his\r\nslaves. These dispensatories avoided the need or cost of a doctor’s\r\nservices unless the trouble was so serious as to need “expert”\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThis was by no means such an unwise system as at first glance may\r\nappear. After all, the doctor would probably dose with the same\r\nmedicines from the same dispensatory, and with the same result. And\r\nwhile quacks were plentiful, well-trained physicians were extremely\r\nscarce, especially in rural areas where pay was sure to be slow and\r\nskimpy.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general state of medical knowledge and practice\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century—bleeding being always a foremost\r\ntreatment of numerous ailments—it seems likely that the liberal use of\r\nnative herbs, being for the most part harmless, was probably the safest\r\nand most effective course of medication. Surely human and animal\r\nexcreta, mashed-up insects, and the like, which were not uncommon in\r\nLondon prescriptions, could not have been more curative than rattlesnake\r\nroot and ginseng, whose praises were sung by the famous William Byrd II:\r\n\r\n  The Earth has never produced any vegetable so friendly to man as\r\n  Ginseng. Nor do I say this at Random, or by the strength of my Faith,\r\n  but by my own Experience. I have found it very cordial and reviving\r\n  after great Fatigue, it warms the Blood, frisks the Spirits\r\n  strengthens the Stomach and comforts the Bowels exceedingly. All this\r\n  it performs with out any of those naughty Effects that might make men\r\n  too troublesome and impertinent to their poor Wives.\r\n\r\n  Then as for the Rattlesnake Root the Reputation of it encreases every\r\n  day. The Tincture of it has done Wonders in the Gout.... By its\r\n  purging, its deuretick, and diaphoretick Qualities it is of great use\r\n  in the Dropsy ... of great Efficacy in Pleuretick Feaver ... [and] a\r\n  Specifick against worms....\r\n\r\n  For the Bite of a mad Dog, ... it may perhaps be as Sure a Remedy; as\r\n  for the Bite of a Rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _A List of Williamsburg Apothecaries_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list includes only those medical practitioners of\r\neighteenth-century Williamsburg who operated apothecary shops. It does\r\nnot include physicians who may have made up and dispensed their own\r\nprescriptions but did not operate a shop.\r\n\r\nAndrew Anderson (1768-1771)\r\n\r\n  Anderson studied medicine in England after serving an apprenticeship\r\n  with Dr. James Carter. Anderson returned to Williamsburg in 1768 and\r\n  formed a partnership with Dr. Carter and they purchased the shop of\r\n  William Biers. Anderson moved to New Kent County in 1771 and in 1774\r\n  married Betsey Burnet, “an agreeable young Lady, with a handsome\r\n  Fortune.”\r\n\r\nRobert Anderson (1764)\r\n\r\n  Anderson advertised his apothecary shop in Williamsburg in 1764.\r\n\r\nWilliam Biers (1765-1768)\r\n\r\n  Biers operated a druggist shop in Williamsburg from about 1765 to 1768\r\n  when he sold his business to Dr. Carter and Dr. Anderson. In 1769\r\n  Biers announced his intention to leave the colony.\r\n\r\nJames Carter (1751-1779)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Carter opened his apothecary shop, “the Unicorn’s Horn,” in\r\n  Williamsburg in 1751 and operated it until 1779 when he sold it to his\r\n  brother William Carter. James continued to practice medicine in\r\n  Williamsburg until his death in 1794.\r\n\r\nWilliam Carter (1773-1784)\r\n\r\n  In 1771 William Carter established his medical practice in Gloucester\r\n  County. In 1773 he came to Williamsburg and formed a partnership with\r\n  his brother James. Six years later he purchased his brother’s share of\r\n  “the Unicorn’s Horn,” and in 1784 he moved to Richmond where he opened\r\n  another apothecary shop.\r\n\r\nRobert Davidson (1737-1739)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Davidson, mayor of Williamsburg, operated a druggist shop in\r\n  partnership with Thomas Goodwin from 1737 to 1739 when Davidson died.\r\n\r\nJohn Minson Galt (1769-1808)\r\n\r\n  After studying medicine in England, Galt opened his apothecary shop in\r\n  1769. From 1775 until 1778 he operated a shop in partnership with Dr.\r\n  William Pasteur. In 1795 Galt was appointed visiting physician to the\r\n  hospital for the insane and in 1799 he was appointed a member of the\r\n  court of directors for the hospital.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gilmer, Sr. (1731-1757)\r\n\r\n  A graduate of the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Gilmer established an\r\n  apothecary shop in Williamsburg in 1731. He operated the shop in\r\n  connection with a successful medical practice until his death in 1757.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gilmer, Jr. (1766-1771)\r\n\r\n  After completing his medical studies in England, Gilmer returned to\r\n  Williamsburg in 1766 and opened his apothecary shop. In 1771 he moved\r\n  to Charlottesville and established a successful practice.\r\n\r\nThomas Goodwin (1735-1739)\r\n\r\n  Goodwin owned a druggist shop in Williamsburg and apparently did not\r\n  engage in a medical practice. From 1737 to 1739 he conducted the shop\r\n  in partnership with Dr. Robert Davidson.\r\n\r\nPeter Hay (1744-1766)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Hay conducted an apothecary shop in Williamsburg from 1744 until\r\n  his death in 1766 when he was described as “one of our most eminent\r\n  physicians.”\r\n\r\nKenneth McKenzie (1732-1755)\r\n\r\n  Dr. McKenzie owned an apothecary shop in Williamsburg from 1732 until\r\n  his death in 1755.\r\n\r\nAlexander Middleton (1776)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Middleton operated an apothecary shop in Williamsburg in 1776.\r\n  Middleton, a tory, was forced to leave Virginia during the\r\n  Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nRobert Nicolson (1779-1783)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Nicolson served his apprenticeship with Dr. Pasteur and then\r\n  studied medicine in England. He returned to Williamsburg in 1779 and\r\n  opened his apothecary shop. After the Revolutionary War he moved his\r\n  shop to Yorktown where he practiced medicine until his death in 1798.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pasteur (1757-1791)\r\n\r\n  After the completion of his apprenticeship with Dr. George Gilmer,\r\n  Sr., Pasteur studied in England for about a year. He returned to\r\n  Williamsburg in 1757 and established an apothecary shop. From 1775 to\r\n  1778 he operated the shop in partnership with John Minson Galt.\r\n\r\nGeorge Pitt (1744-1768)\r\n\r\n  Dr. Pitt, born in 1724 in England and “bred a Surgeon,” established\r\n  his apothecary shop in Williamsburg in 1744 at the “Sign of the\r\n  Rhinoceros.” In 1768 he closed his shop and returned to England. He\r\n  later came back to Virginia but no longer engaged in medicine or\r\n  pharmacy. In 1776 Pitt, a tory, left Virginia again. He died later\r\n  that year in England.\r\n\r\nThomas Wharton (1735-1746)\r\n\r\n  Wharton arrived in Virginia about 1703 as an indentured servant to Dr.\r\n  Richard Wright. By 1735 Wharton had established an apothecary shop in\r\n  Williamsburg, which he operated until his death in 1746. He left his\r\n  drugs, medicines, and shop utensils to Dr. McKenzie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Suggestions for Further Reading_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitfield J.
