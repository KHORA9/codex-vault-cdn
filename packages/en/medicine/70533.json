But in dealing with the subject-matter\r\nof the present volume, namely, the Materia Medica and Pharmacy of the\r\nancients, it became apparent to me from the first that a different\r\nplan of proceeding was indispensable, otherwise the usefulness of the\r\nwhole work to the ordinary reader would be very much impaired. It is\r\nwell known how frequently the nomenclature of the sciences connected\r\nwith these subjects has changed, and what differences of opinion have\r\nprevailed with regard to many of the substances used in the practice of\r\nmedicine by the ancients. In order, therefore, to render the information\r\ncontained in this and the preceding volumes of ready access for practical\r\npurposes, it appeared to me necessary to bring down the annotations to\r\nmodern times, so that one might see at once what is the exact import of\r\nthe ancient terms of art, and what the medicinal substances mentioned\r\nin the course of the work actually were, according to the nomenclature\r\nof the present age. Accordingly it will be found that the Commentary in\r\nthis volume abounds in references to modern authorities, and contains a\r\nvariety of materials collected, not only from the earlier herbalists and\r\ncommentators on Dioscorides, Theophrastus, and other ancient authors,\r\nbut likewise from recent writers on Botany, Mineralogy, and the Materia\r\nMedica, in illustration of the various articles which are treated of\r\nin this work. And I have much satisfaction in having it in my power to\r\nstate that the plan now described has the authority and sanction of the\r\nCouncil, who gave it their entire approval. To Dr. Pereira I owe my\r\ngrateful acknowledgment for much valuable advice and assistance received\r\nfrom him on this part of my work; but at the same time it is fair to him\r\nto state I have no right to make him in anywise responsible for opinions\r\nherein advanced which may turn out to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having brought my laborious undertaking to a conclusion, I\r\nwould embrace the present opportunity of returning my most sincere\r\nexpression of thanks to the Council for the honour which they conferred\r\nupon me in selecting my work for publication, and for the very\r\nflattering terms in which they speak of the first volume in the Annual\r\nReport of their proceedings for 1845. I trust that whatever degree of\r\nmerit they discovered in _it_ will be found not to be wanting in the\r\nsucceeding parts, and that, taken together, the three volumes will be\r\nacknowledged to constitute a more copious repertory of ancient opinions\r\non professional subjects than is to be found elsewhere. If such be the\r\njudgment which the intelligent members of the Sydenham Society shall\r\ngenerally pronounce on my work, I shall certainly never regret the time\r\nand exertions which I have bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\n                       τοιόν δ’ ἀπέβη τόδε πρᾶγμα,\r\n\r\n                                                                     F.

I.—ON THE TEMPERAMENTS OF SUBSTANCES AS INDICATED BY THEIR TASTES.\r\n\r\nIt is not safe to judge from the smell with regard to the temperament\r\nof sensible objects; for inodorous substances consist indeed of thick\r\nparticles, but it is not clear whether they are of a hot or cold\r\nnature; and odorous substances, to a certain extent, consist of fine\r\nparticles and are hot; but the degree of the tenuity of their parts, or\r\nof their hotness, is not indicated, because of the inequality of their\r\nsubstance. And still more impracticable is it to judge of them from their\r\ncolours, for of every colour are found hot, cold, drying, and moistening\r\nsubstances. But in tasting, all parts of the bodies subjected to it come\r\nin contact with the tongue and excite the sense, so that thereby one may\r\njudge clearly of their powers in their temperaments. Astringents, then,\r\ncontract, obstruct, condense, dispel, and incrassate; and, in addition\r\nto all these properties, they are of a cold and desiccative nature. That\r\nwhich is acid, cuts, divides, attenuates, removes obstructions, and\r\ncleanses without heating; but that which is acrid, resembles the acid in\r\nbeing attenuant and purging, but differs from it in this, that the acid\r\nis cold, and the acrid hot; and, further, in this, that the acid repels,\r\nbut the acrid attracts, discusses, breaks down, and is escharotic. In\r\nlike manner, that which is bitter cleanses the pores, is detergent and\r\nattenuant, and cuts the thick humours without sensible heat. What is\r\nwatery is cold, incrassate, condenses, contracts, obstructs, mortifies,\r\nand stupefies. But that which is salt contracts, braces, preserves as\r\na pickle, dries, without decided heat or cold. What is sweet relaxes,\r\nconcocts, softens, and rarefies: but what is oily humectates, softens,\r\nand relaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.—ON THE ORDER AND DEGREES OF THE TEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\nA moderate medicine which is of the same temperament as that to which it\r\nis applied, so as neither to dry, moisten, cool, nor heat, must not be\r\ncalled either dry, moist, cold, or hot; but whatever is drier, moister,\r\nhotter, or colder, is so called from its prevailing power. It will be\r\nsufficient for every useful purpose to make four ranks according to\r\nthe prevailing temperament, calling that substance hot, according to\r\nthe first rank, when it heats, indeed, but not manifestly, requiring\r\nreflection to demonstrate its existence: and in like manner with regard\r\nto cold, dry, and moist, when the prevailing temperament requires\r\ndemonstration, and has no strong nor manifest virtue. Such things as\r\nare manifestly possessed of drying, moistening, heating or cooling\r\nproperties, may be said to be of the second rank. Such things as have\r\nthese properties to a strong, but not an extreme degree, may be said to\r\nbe of the third rank. But such things as are naturally so hot as to form\r\neschars and burn, are of the fourth. In like manner such things as are\r\nso cold as to occasion the death of a part are also of the fourth. But\r\nnothing is of so drying a nature as to be of the fourth rank, without\r\nburning, for that which dries in a great degree burns also; such are\r\nmisy, chalcitis, and quicklime. But a substance may be of the third rank\r\nof desiccants without being caustic, such as all those things which\r\nare strongly astringent, of which kind are the unripe juice of grapes,\r\nsumach, and alum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following is a list of the ancient authorities on the\r\nMateria Medica and Pharmacy: Hippocrates (pluries); Dioscorides (de\r\nMateria Medica); Celsus (v); Scribonius Largus (pluries); Marcellus\r\nEmpiricus; Pliny (H. N. pluries); Rei Rusticæ Scriptores; Apuleius (de\r\nHerbis); Antonius Musa (de Herba Betonica); Macer Floridus; Galenus (de\r\nSimpl.; de Comp. Med. sec. loc.; de Comp. Med. sec. gen.); Aëtius (i and\r\nii); Oribasius (Med. Collect. xi et seq.); Sextus Platonicus (de Med.\r\nex animal.); Zosimus Panopolita (de Zythorum confectione); Actuarius\r\n(Meth. Med.); Myrepsus (pluries); Psellus (de Lapidibus); Rhases (Contin.\r\nliber ult.; ad Mansor. iii); Avicenna (ii, et alibi); Serapion (de\r\nSimpl.; de Antidot.); Mesue (de Simpl.); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii and x);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v); Albengnefit (Libellus de Simpl. med. virt.); Geber\r\n(Chemia); Servitor (de Præpar. Med. i. e. xxviii Albucasis); Baitharis\r\nPræfatio ap. Casiri Biblioth. Arab. Hisp. p. 276; Ebn Baithar (Uebersetz\r\nvon Sontheimer); Rei Rusticæ Scriptores Arabici ap. Casiri B. A. H.;\r\nAlchindus (Libellus de Med. compos. grad.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates, although he appears to have been familiarly acquainted with\r\nthe properties of most of the vegetable substances of the Old World,\r\nstill employed in the practice of medicine, has left no regular treatise\r\non the Materia Medica and pharmacy of his time. Theophrastus has treated\r\nmore fully and ingeniously of botany and vegetable physiology than any\r\nother Greek writer; but except in two or three instances he scarcely\r\nalludes to the medicinal powers of the articles which he describes.\r\nIn short, Dioscorides is the first and great authority on the Materia\r\nMedica,—his contributions to which can never be too highly appreciated;\r\nfor, as Alston justly remarks, the science in ancient times remained\r\never after in nearly the same state as he left it. The genius of Galen,\r\nit is true, shed a considerable degree of lustre over the subject by his\r\nphilosophical theory regarding the general actions of medicines; but\r\nhis descriptions of particular substances, and even his detail of their\r\nproperties, are mostly borrowed from Dioscorides. The Greek authors,\r\nsubsequent to his time, can scarcely be said to have added one single\r\narticle to the list of medicinal substances described by him. Aëtius,\r\nhowever, although he can advance no great claim to originality, has\r\ngiven, as we shall see presently, a remarkably lucid exposition of the\r\nGalenical principles of therapeutics. Of Pliny’s great work, so replete\r\nwith the most rare and curious information on almost every department of\r\nancient literature, we feel reluctant to speak otherwise than in terms\r\nof unqualified eulogy, and yet candour obliges us to admit that on all\r\nmedical subjects this writer is but a very indifferent authority. For,\r\nbeing evidently possessed of no practical acquaintance with professional\r\nmatters, he appears to have been wholly incapable of discriminating real\r\nfrom pretended facts in medicine, and has accordingly jumbled important\r\nand useless matter together in many instances with very little judgment,\r\nnor can his opinions be much relied upon except when he copies closely\r\nfrom Dioscorides. The same objection cannot be made to his countryman\r\nCelsus; but the plan of his work being limited, the account which\r\nhe gives of these matters is confined to a classification of simple\r\nsubstances, and a few formulæ for the formation of the more important\r\npharmaceutical compounds. The Arabians added camphor, senna, musk, nux\r\nvomica, myrobalans, tamarinds, and a good many other articles to the\r\nMateria Medica; but, upon the whole, they transmitted the science to us\r\nin much the same shape as regards arrangement and general principles\r\nas they received it from their Grecian masters. At the same time it is\r\nimpossible to take even a cursory view of the great work of Ebn Baithar,\r\nnow fortunately rendered accessible to many European scholars by Dr.\r\nSontheimer’s translation of it into German, without being struck with\r\nthe amazing industry, enterprise, and talent displayed by that wonderful\r\npeople in this department of medical science. In this collection,\r\nmore than 1400 medicinal and dietetical articles are described, many\r\nof them no doubt in nearly the same terms as they had been noticed by\r\nDioscorides and Galen, but of original matter relative to substances\r\nthen for the first time introduced into the practice of medicine, there\r\nis no lack; and it is only to be regretted that a proper key to these\r\nstores is still a desideratum which it is to be feared will not soon be\r\nsupplied. Ebn Baithar’s list of medicinal substances, however, is far\r\nmore copious than those of the other Arabians, who in general follow\r\nclosely in the footsteps of the Greek authorities, and seldom supply\r\nanything very original of their own. For example, the Materia Medica\r\nof Rhases contains only 765 articles, and that of Avicenna only 747,\r\nwhich it is to be remarked, is a smaller number than is contained in\r\nthe work of Dioscorides, wherein Alston states that he counted above 90\r\nminerals, 700 plants, and 168 animal substances, making 958 in all. This\r\nis nearly triple the number of simples contained in the Materia Medica\r\nof the Edinburgh Dispensatory at the present day, which amount only to\r\n341 articles; so that if this branch of medical science has received any\r\nmaterial improvement in modern times, it must arise principally from\r\nour superior accuracy in estimating the virtues of the substances now\r\nin use, or in making more ingenious compositions of their elementary\r\ningredients. At all events, it is quite clear that the Greek, Roman, and\r\nArabian physicians were amply provided with medicines of every possible\r\ncharacter, and there is no reason to suppose that they were in anywise\r\nbehind us in the skilful management of them. It has been affirmed,\r\nindeed, in some late publications which we have seen, that the ancients\r\nhad never classified the articles in the Materia Medica according to the\r\nnature of their actions; but this we need scarcely assure the reader is\r\na very erroneous account of the matter: and in proof of this we could\r\nhave wished, if our limits had permitted us, to have introduced here some\r\nof the classified lists of medicinal substances as given by the ancient\r\nauthorities, and more especially those of Aëtius and Serapion.\r\n\r\n    Verum hæc ipse equidem, spatiis inclusus iniquis\r\n    Prætereo, atque aliis post me memoranda relinquo.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above that Aëtius’s account of the general principles\r\nof the Materia Medica is particularly excellent, and we have now to add,\r\nthat as it is sufficiently explicit to convey a distinct idea of the\r\nGalenical system, and is contained within moderate limits when compared\r\nwith the full and lengthy exposition of it given by Galen himself, we\r\nshall give that of Aëtius entire, and confine our annotations almost\r\nsolely to it in the present instance:—\r\n\r\n\r\n“_On the Powers of Simple Medicines._\r\n\r\n“There are differences in the particular actions of medicines, arising\r\nfrom each of them being to a certain degree hot, or cold, or dry, or\r\nhumid, or consisting of subtile or of gross particles, but the degree\r\nin which each of them is possessed of the above-mentioned properties\r\ncannot be truly and accurately determined. We have endeavoured, however,\r\nto define them in such a manner as will be sufficient for all practical\r\npurposes, laying it down that there is one class of medicines possessed\r\nof a similar temperament to our bodies, when they have received a certain\r\nprinciple of change and aliation from the heat in them, and that there is\r\nanother which is of a hotter temperament than we. Of this temperament I\r\nhave thought it right to make four orders, the first being imperceptible\r\nto the senses, and only to be inferred from reflection; the second being\r\nperceptible to the senses; the third strongly heating but not burning;\r\nand the fourth, or last, caustic. In like manner of frigorific or cooling\r\nthings, the first order requires reflection to demonstrate its coldness:\r\nthe second consists of such things as are perceptibly cold; the third\r\nis perceptibly cold, but does not occasion mortification; the fourth\r\nproduces mortification. So it is in like manner with humectating and\r\ndesiccant articles. Let such an order of degrees be laid down to render\r\nclearer the course of instruction, rose oil or the rose itself being\r\nplaced in the first order of cooling things; the juice of roses in the\r\nsecond, and in the third and fourth those things which are extremely\r\ncold, such as cicuta, meconium, mandragora, and hyoscyamus. In regard\r\nto hot things, dill and fenugreek belong to the first order; those\r\nwhich are next to them, to the second; and so of the third and fourth,\r\nuntil we come to the caustic. In like manner, respecting moistening and\r\ndesiccant medicines, beginning with those of a moderate degree, we may\r\narrange them until we come to their extremes. Such knowledge is of no\r\nsmall importance for the purpose of medical instruction. One ought also\r\nto exercise the sense of taste, and remember the peculiar qualities of\r\njuices; as, for example, that such a substance when applied to the tongue\r\ndries strongly, contracts, and roughens it to a considerable depth, such\r\nas unripe wild pears, cornels, and the like; every such thing that is\r\nintensely austere is called sour. Such things, as when applied to the\r\ntongue, do not constringe and contract it like astringents, but, on the\r\ncontrary, appear to be detergent and cleansing, are called salt. Such\r\nthings as are more detergent and also rougher in a painful degree, are\r\ncalled bitter. Those things which are biting and corrosive with a strong\r\nheat, are called acrid; and such as are biting without heat, are called\r\nacid, and these have the power of causing a fermentation when poured upon\r\nearth. Of those which lubricate, fill, remove asperities, and, as it\r\nwere, erosions of the tongue, such as do so with sensible delight, are\r\ncalled sweet; but such as do this without sensible delight, are called\r\nfat. If, then, you wish to form a judgment of acrimony, you may learn\r\nto do so from garlic, onions, and the like, which are to be frequently\r\ntasted and long masticated, in order that the sensation thereby imparted\r\nmay be fixed in the memory. But if you wish to acquire the perception\r\nof astringency, you may do so from galls, sumach, and the like; if of\r\nbitterness, from natron and bile; and if of sweetness, from rob and\r\nhoney. Further, if you would wish to judge of such things as are devoid\r\nof all qualities, or of an intermediate quality as to taste, take water,\r\nand having tasted it, retain the perception in your memory; but see\r\nthat it be the purest water, and that it contain none of the aforesaid\r\nqualities; neither sweetness, acidity, acrimony, nor bitterness; and,\r\nin addition, that it be neither very hot nor very cold. Proceeding from\r\nthis, you may the more readily perceive the obscure taste of certain\r\njuices which I call moderately sweet, but which others call watery; such\r\nas the juice of green reeds and of grass, of wheat and of barley, and\r\nof moderately sweet things, as resembling what I have described to be\r\nof all other things the most devoid of qualities, I mean water, which\r\nis in an intermediate state between heat and cold, or inclines a little\r\nto cold. If being endowed with such a taste, it have not a liquid but a\r\ndry consistence, it must necessarily be terrene and desiccative without\r\npungency. These things are called emplastic, such as starch, and most of\r\nthe thoroughly-washed metals, as pompholyx, ceruse, calamine, Cimolian\r\nearth, Samian earth, and the like. Some are not only terrene, but also\r\nwatery in their nature; and some contain no little air in them: such\r\nare viscid and therefore emplastic. There are two kind of emplastic\r\nmedicines, the one very terrene and dry, and the other altogether viscid,\r\nbeing composed of water, earth, and, for the most part, of air, such\r\nas sweet oil. The white of an egg is similar to oil, but more terrene.\r\nThe cheesy part of milk is emplastic, and so also the fat of swine. The\r\nfat and suet of a bull and a buck-goat are acrid, and more terrene than\r\nthat of swine. That of a goose or a cock is hotter and drier than that\r\nof swine; but of subtile parts, and by no means terrene. The fats then,\r\nif they have no acrimony, are emplastic, or obstruent of the pores, more\r\nespecially if of a drier and more terrene nature, such as well-washed\r\nwax. Emplastic medicines then are of such a nature. But astringents\r\nare terrene, and with regard to the composition of their particles are\r\nthick; but in their qualities they are cold. Acids in composition are\r\nattenuating, but cold, like astringents. The terrene particles contained\r\nin the juices, which, when melted, contract and dry the humidity of the\r\nsentient parts of the tongue, if particularly rough, are called sour; but\r\nif less so, austere; and we properly call the temperament of such juices\r\ncold. But since they are unequally desiccative—for in this consists\r\ntheir asperity—they are likewise terrene; for every watery substance\r\npermeates the body evenly, and when removed it easily coalesces; but\r\nwhat is terrene when removed does not readily coalesce again. And the\r\npeculiarity of the sensation, if you will recollect the impression, will\r\ntestify to the same effect; for the passage of acid juices, in the organs\r\nof sensation, appears quick; but that of sour, slow; and acids exert\r\ntheir actions more on the deep-seated parts, whereas sour substances act\r\nmore superficially. When you wish to ascertain the action of a truly sour\r\nsubstance, if that which is made trial of appear at the same time sour\r\nand pungent, I would recommend you to lay that species aside, and to have\r\nrecourse to something which is sour without being pungent, and neither\r\nacid, sweet, nor bitter, but as much as possible having no one quality\r\nor power mixed up with its astringency; for it is useless and foolish to\r\nmake trial of such a medicine, as it cannot be ascertained whether it\r\nbe by its astringency, or by any of the qualities mixed with it, or by\r\na combination of both, that the substance which is made trial of exerts\r\nits action. Therefore, chalcitis, misy, copperas, the flakes of copper,\r\nsori, and, in addition to them, the armeniacum pictorium (Armenian\r\npigment), mercury, and other astringent substances which are also at\r\nthe same time pungent, act by both their properties upon the bodies to\r\nwhich they are applied; but we are not thereby informed whether they burn\r\nby their astringency or by their acrimony; for such substances, when\r\ntaken into the body, being composed of gross particles, and rather hot\r\nin their powers, having become ignited in the course of time, according\r\nto the change which they undergo in the body of the animal, ulcerate\r\nand burn the parts about the stomach like heated stones or irons; and\r\nowing to their weight they are incapable of being distributed over the\r\nbody. It is better, therefore, after much observation, to look out for\r\nsomething that is purely astringent, and when you have found such a\r\nsubstance, make haste to try it in the manner you have formerly heard\r\ndescribed; such as having tasted the flowers of the wild pomegranate,\r\ngalls, or the flowers of the cultivated pomegranate, hypocistis, acacia,\r\nsumach, or the like, if the substance appear intensely sour, and it is\r\nmanifest that it contains no other quality, you must prove the action\r\nof astringency from it. A sour substance then is terrene and cold, and\r\nits quality may necessarily be removed in three ways; either by being\r\nheated, or moistened, or by undergoing both these changes at the same\r\ntime. If only heated, it will neither become more humid nor softer; but\r\nbecoming harder it will have acquired sweetness, as is the case with\r\nacorns and chesnuts, as they are called. But if only moistened, and if\r\nthe humidity is of a thick nature and watery, it becomes austere; for\r\nthe astringent part being dissolved renders the juice austere, it being\r\nthe property of a watery fluid to obtund the powers of every juice. If a\r\nsubtile and airy fluid be superadded, it will become acid, for coldness\r\nbeing attenuating will render the former quality acid. When moistened and\r\nheated at the same time, if with a watery humidity, it will occasion a\r\nchange to sweetness; but if with an airy, to fatness; for the fruits of\r\nsuch trees as appear sweet to us when ripened, are, when newly formed,\r\nsour and dry in their consistence, each according to the nature of the\r\ntree which produced it; but in process of time, they become more humid or\r\njuicy; and some get acidity superadded to their sourness, which latter\r\nquality when they have laid aside they become again sweet as they arrive\r\nat maturity. Some do not acquire sweetness at all while upon the trees,\r\nbut after a time, when separated from them. Some without the intermediate\r\nacidity pass from sourness to sweetness, as the fruit of the olive. All\r\nthings are concocted by heat, which is of a twofold nature, the one\r\nproper and innate, and the other supplied from without by the sun. But,\r\nsince being sour at first, they become sweet when ripe, their sweetness\r\nis occasioned by heat; but their acidity and sourness by cold. And it has\r\nalready become obvious that as fruits being sour at first, in process\r\nof time become, some sweet, some acid, some austere, and some remain\r\nsour, that great variety will arise from a mixture of these qualities.\r\nWherefore, the fruit of the ilex, the cornel, and other such things, are\r\nsour to the last, because they remain cold and dry as at the beginning,\r\nbeing only increased in size, but acquiring no other internal change.\r\nThe fruits of the myrtle, the wild pear, and the oak are sweet and sour\r\nat the same time; but the fruit of Aminæan vines, wine, and such like\r\nthings, are only austere. The fruit of the palm tree, and of wines, the\r\nSurrentine, and such as have sweetness joined to astringency, are at the\r\nsame time austere and sweet. The Theræan wine, the Scybelitic, boiled\r\nmust called rob, and other such like things, are only sweet. The fruit\r\nand juice of the olive in particular, but also of all other such things\r\nfrom which oil is formed, are fatty. And as a sour juice in process of\r\ntime, becoming at first sweeter, and afterward turning more acrid and\r\nbitter, ends in becoming wholly bitter; so in like manner, a cold juice\r\nbecomes at first more acid, and if wholly congealed it turns entirely\r\nacid; and such fruits as at gathering are filled with much humidity,\r\nand such as otherwise acquire much water, readily become acid from very\r\nslight causes. For if the unripe grape is acid, but the ripe sweet, and\r\nif all fruits are ripened by the solar heat, it is obvious that what\r\nis more imperfect and colder is acid; whereas, what is more perfect\r\nand hotter is sweet. When wine, therefore, from refrigeration becomes\r\nacid, it is clear that it returns again to the same juice from which\r\nit was formed, I mean that of the unripe grape. But vinegar differs\r\nthus far in power from the juice of the unripe grape, that the vinegar\r\nhas acquired a certain degree of acrimony from the putrefactive heat\r\n(”fermentation?“); but the juice of the unripe grape has no acquired\r\nheat, and therefore none of the acrimony of vinegar; wherefore, vinegar\r\nis more attenuating than the juice of the unripe grape, as the sensation\r\nbears testimony to the truth of what has been said; but the acrimony of\r\nthe vinegar is not sufficient to overcome the coldness arising from its\r\nacidity; it serves, however, to make it more penetrating; for inasmuch\r\nas heat is more penetrating than cold, so does the acrimony of vinegar\r\nthe more readily pass the pores of sensible bodies, and thus acrimony\r\ntakes the lead, but coldness follows at no great interval. And it is this\r\nmixed and almost indescribable sensation which prevents us from calling\r\nvinegar simply cold; for we perceive in it a certain fiery acrimony.\r\nBut the coldness, from the accompanying acidity, straightway obtunds\r\nand extinguishes the acrimony, and therefore there is a much greater\r\nsensation from the coldness than from the heat; for some persons by\r\ndrinking oxycrate in the summer season are sensibly cooled, and remain\r\nfree from thirst. But since thirst arises from two distinct causes,\r\neither from a deficiency of moisture or an excess of heat, that arising\r\nfrom dryness is not cured, but that occasioned by heat is removed by it;\r\nfor vinegar by itself does not moisten, but is decidedly refrigerant.\r\nThirst, therefore, arising from a hot intemperament, or from a hot and\r\ndry one, is not to be cured by drinking vinegar; but when humidity and\r\nheat meet together, the proper cure of such a kind of thirst is vinegar;\r\nbut otherwise in the case of those who are thirsty in ardent fevers and\r\nall other hot diseases, and in those during summer and hot weather,\r\ntheir state is a compound of heat and dryness, so that the proper\r\ncure for it is a composition of vinegar and water; for the vinegar is\r\ndecidedly refrigerant, and by its tenuity readily diffusible, and the\r\nwater, in addition to its property of cooling, is the most moistening\r\nof all substances, for nothing is more moistening than water. But as an\r\nexternal application for heat of the hypochondrium, the juice of unripe\r\ngrapes is preferable to vinegar, because it has no violent and offensive\r\ncoldness, nor any pungent heat mixed with it; for in such affections\r\npersons require to be soothed without violence by an application which\r\nwill not induce externally any pungent acrimony. The juice of the unripe\r\ngrape, then, is not only acid but sour; for, as mentioned before, almost\r\nall the fruits of trees are at first sour to the taste; and not only\r\nare acids cold, but so also are sour and austere things. And if any one\r\nwill taste quinces, myrtles, or medlars, he will perceive clearly that\r\nthere is one sensation from acids, and another from sour and austere\r\nthings; for sour things seem to propel inwards the part which they\r\ntouch, everywhere equally squeezing, constricting, and contracting, as\r\nit were; but the austere seem to penetrate deeply, and to induce a rough\r\nand unequable sensation, so that by drying they expel the humidity of\r\nthe parts of sensation. Thus, between sour and austere juices, there is\r\na certain peculiar difference of sensation not easily to be described,\r\nbut which everybody must understand from what has been said. Every sour\r\nsubstance, then, when free from all other qualities, I have upon trial\r\nalways found to be cold; but every sweet substance is hot, and does not\r\ngreatly exceed the heat in us; and as we are delighted, more especially\r\nif we are cold, with the touch of warm water, until it expand the parts\r\ncongealed by the cold, and as it heats us, and does not dissolve nor\r\nbreak the continuity of the parts, it is very pleasant and useful; so all\r\nsweet food is hot, and yet it is not possessed of such a degree of heat\r\nas to be unpleasant, but remains within the limits of those things which\r\nexpand, soften, and are demulcent: for all nutritive food is allied to,\r\nand agrees with, the whole substance of the bodies which it nourishes; it\r\nrequires, therefore, to be moderately hot, so as to agree with the bodies\r\nwhich are nourished; and hence one kind of food and medicine does not\r\nagree with all men; for according to his peculiar substance and affection\r\nis every one delighted and benefited. And such being the nature of things\r\nthose kinds of food which are less sweet are less hot, and their heat is\r\nproportionate to their sweetness; but these things, when they get to an\r\nimmoderate degree of heat, are no longer sweet, but appear bitter, such\r\nas honey which is old and much boiled, and so also with all other sweet\r\nthings; for such things as without boiling or preparation are allied to\r\nthe temperaments of the bodies which they nourish, appear already sweet;\r\nbut all such as are not allied appear unsavoury until prepared, for\r\nthose which are hot require to be corrected by cold, and those which are\r\nsufficiently cold by the mixture of calefacient food and by heat. In\r\nlike manner such things as are terrene and drier than proper, are to be\r\ncorrected by humidity; and those things which are humid and watery, by\r\ndrying; that which is sweet therefore, in addition to being more or less\r\nhot, is necessarily more or less humid. But when this bitterness arises\r\nfrom being over-roasted, as in lime and ashes, it is necessarily rendered\r\ndry and hot. For this reason every bitter thing is of such a nature as\r\nto prove detergent, and is calculated to break down and to cut viscid\r\nand thick humours, and such are ashes and natron; but that bitter sap\r\nis dry and terrene, may be collected from the circumstance, that bitter\r\nthings are of all others the least prone to putrefaction, and do not\r\nengender worms nor other animals such as are usually formed in roots,\r\nherbs, and fruits when they become putrid; for we see that such animals\r\nand putrefactions take place in humid bodies. Those things which are\r\nintensely bitter (I call those things such which have no other manifest\r\nquality) are uneatable, not only by men, but by almost all animals,\r\nbecause every living creature is more or less humid, and bitter things\r\nare dry in like manner as ashes and cinders. As, therefore, that which is\r\ntruly sweet is nutritive, and that which is purely bitter innutritive,\r\nso those things which are intermediate are nutritive indeed, but less\r\nso than the sweet. The salt juice is allied to the bitter, for both are\r\nterrene and hot; but they differ from one another perceptibly in this,\r\nthat the bitter is more attenuated and wrought by the heat and dryness;\r\nand thus, too, of salts, such as are hard, denser, and more terrene (as\r\nare almost all the fossils), are less calefacient and attenuating; but\r\nsuch as are brittle and porous are at the same time more attenuating and\r\nhotter; and some of them are bitterish, being intermediate between the\r\nhard salts and aphronitrum; and if you will warm any saltish thing to a\r\ngreat degree it will straightway become bitter. Thus, the water of the\r\nLake Asphaltitis, which they call the Dead Sea, being contained within\r\na hollow and hot place, and overheated by the sun, becomes bitter, and\r\nfor this reason it becomes more bitter in summer than in winter. And if\r\nyou will draw some of it, and put it into a hollow vessel in a place\r\nexposed to the sun during the summer season it will straightway become\r\nmore bitter than it generally is. For no animals appear to be found in\r\nsuch water, neither plants; and although the rivers which fall into it\r\ncontain many large fishes, more especially the river near Jericho called\r\nJordan, none of the fishes pass the mouth of the river, and if you will\r\ncatch some and throw them into the Lake, you will see that they die\r\nimmediately, and hence it is called the Dead Lake or Sea. Thus, that\r\nwhich is intensely bitter is inimical to all plants and animals, and is\r\nof a parched and dry nature, becoming like soot from roasting. Having,\r\ntherefore, settled the powers of bitter juices, and said that they are\r\ncutting, detergent, attenuant, and decidedly hot, to such a degree only\r\nas not to burn, we shall next proceed to the acrid; and first we may say\r\nof them that they are truly hot, then corrosive, caustic, escharotic, and\r\nof a dissolvent nature, when applied externally to the skin; but when\r\ntaken internally, those which, in their whole substance are adverse to\r\ncertain animals, are all septic and destructive to them, as the cantharis\r\nand buprestis are to men. But such as are distinguished only by excess\r\nof their heating powers, if thicker and terrene, as arsenic, sandarach,\r\nand the like, we call ulcerative of the internal parts; but if they\r\nconsist of subtile parts, such as the common seeds, carrot, anise, and\r\nthe like, they are diuretic, diaphoretic, and, in a word, cutting and\r\ndiscutient; and some are also useful in expectorations from the chest\r\nand menstrual discharges. But acrid juices would seem to differ from\r\nbitter, not only in possessing strong heat, but also in this, that all\r\nbitter things are not only hot but of a dry temperament like ashes,\r\nwhile in such acrid substances as are not bitter, there is often much\r\nhumidity mixed, and therefore we use no few acrid things as articles\r\nof food. But since enough has been said respecting all the juices,\r\nit still remains to treat of the vapours. Most of the vapours, then,\r\naffect us similarly to the juices; for all acids, and likewise vinegar\r\nitself, move the senses of smell and taste in like manner; and acrid\r\nthings, as garlic, onions, and the like, are pungent and offensive to\r\nthe smell, no less than to the taste; so that, without tasting certain\r\nthings, such as dung, we are confident that we know its quality, and\r\ntherefore at once we abstain from them, because we repose confidence in\r\nthe sense of smell. And of fragrant things, such as have become putrid\r\nand offend the smell, we straightway throw away, and do not attempt to\r\ntaste; and in short, with regard to almost all things, the smell and\r\ntaste are found to agree; and we refer each of them to two classes,\r\ncalling the most of those substances which have smell, odorous, and\r\nfetid, and considering the odorous analogous to sweet things, and the\r\nfetid to such as are not sweet to the tongue, it would appear that from\r\nbodies which have no smell there is but little emitted, or at least that\r\nit is disproportionate to their bulk, as is the case with salt and sour\r\nthings in particular; for the substance of sour things is of a dense\r\nand cold nature, so that it is natural that what is emitted from them\r\nshould be small in quantity, thick, and terrene in its parts, so as not\r\nto reach the brain in respiration. Hence it is not safe to judge of\r\ntheir temperament from the smell as it is from the taste: for we know\r\nthat things which are inodorous consist of thick particles, but it is\r\nnot apparent how they are as to heat and cold; and that fragrant things\r\nconsist of subtile particles, and are hot in their nature; but it is not\r\nshown by the smell but by the taste what is the degree of their tenuity\r\nand heat. The inequality of their substance is the cause why fragrant\r\nthings give no certain indication of temperament; and therefore it is\r\nnot safe to judge of all the qualities of the rose from its smell; but\r\nin taste all the parts of the bodies which are tasted fall equably upon\r\nthe tongue, and each excites a sensation agreeably to its nature, namely,\r\nthe sour part in it which is terrene consists of thick particles and is\r\ncold; the bitter, which consists of subtile parts and is hot; and third,\r\nthe watery, which is necessarily cold. It is not safe then, as has been\r\nsaid, to form a judgment of all the powers of simple substances from the\r\nsmell; but it is still more impracticable to estimate simple medicines\r\nfrom their colours; for hot, cold, dry, and humid substances are found\r\nof every colour. And yet from the colour of every kind of seeds, roots,\r\nor juices it is possible to derive a certain indication of their\r\ntemperament. For example, onions, squills, and wine, the whiter they are,\r\nare the less hot; but such as are of a yellowish and intermediate colour\r\nare hotter. And wheat, vetches, and kidney-beans, and chick-peas, the\r\nroot of iris, that of kingspear, and many others, are similarly affected.\r\nIn each genus, for the most part, such things as are gold coloured,\r\nred, and of a bright yellow, are hotter than the white, so that if any\r\nconjecture can be formed therefrom of the powers of medicines, it is so\r\nfar well. It is best then, as has been often said and demonstrated, to\r\ndetermine the powers of each by exact experiment, for by this you cannot\r\nbe deceived; but before ascertaining their powers by experiment, the\r\ntaste will give many indications, in which it will be assisted in a small\r\ndegree by the smell.” (_Præfatio in Aëtium._)\r\n\r\nFor a fuller account of the subject, the reader is referred to the first\r\nfive books of Galen’s work ‘On the Powers of Simples;’ to the first\r\ntractate of the Second Book of Avicenna; and to the introductory part of\r\nSerapion’s work ‘On Simples.’ A useful abstract of the ancient opinions\r\nis given in the small tract of Albengnefit. The nature of the tastes\r\nis ingeniously discussed in the ‘Timæus’ of Plato, and by Theophrastus\r\n(de Causis Plantarum, vi.) Alkhendi’s theory of the action of compound\r\nmedicines appears to be ingenious; but it is complex and difficult to\r\nexplain, being founded upon the principles of geometrical properties\r\nand musical harmony. The ‘Chemia’ of Geber contains a very interesting\r\nabstract of the knowledge possessed by the ancients regarding the\r\nrecondite nature of substances, that is to say, on alchemy, but supplies\r\nlittle or no information on the Materia Medica or Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding our present commentary, it may be proper to remark, as\r\ntending to show the importance of the Galenical theory of the action of\r\nmedicines in the literature of medicine, that not only was it generally\r\nadopted by most of the Greek and Arabian authorities subsequent to\r\nGalen, but it prevails in the works of all our old herbalists, as, for\r\nexample, Gerarde, Parkinson, Culpeper, and of the other writers on the\r\nMateria Medica, down to the days of Quincy. We may also take the present\r\nopportunity to state that in the works of the ancient authorities, we\r\nhave detected a few traces of the singular doctrine of signatures, as it\r\nhas been called, but that with the exception of Geber, who can scarcely\r\nbe held to be a medical writer, we have found no allusion to alchemy\r\n_or_ astral influence, as having anything to do with the operation of\r\nmedicines. The first ancient writer who notices alchemy, we believe, is\r\nFirmicus (iii.) Though the Arabians were much given to this superstitious\r\nconceit, it would appear from what we have mentioned that their medical\r\nauthorities had kept their minds free from the contamination of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.—ON THE POWERS OF SIMPLES INDIVIDUALLY.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The part of our task upon which we are now entering is\r\nat once so arduous and important, that we cannot but feel diffident\r\nof our abilities to execute it properly. We may venture, however, to\r\nassure the reader that we have spared no pains as far as lay in our\r\npower to unravel the intricacies with which this department of ancient\r\nscience is involved, and that, with this intention, upon every article\r\nwe have carefully compared the descriptions of the ancient authors,\r\nand have likewise availed ourselves of the learned labours of modern\r\ncommentators on Theophrastus, Pliny, and Dioscorides. We may mention\r\nthat those we have generally reposed most confidence in are Matthiolus,\r\nDodonæus, Harduin, Stackhouse, Schneider, Sprengel, and Sibthorp. It\r\nwill also be seen that we have paid a good deal of attention to the\r\nworks of our English herbalists, the study of whose works we consider\r\nhighly important, as reflecting much light on the ancient literature\r\nof this subject. We have further culled freely from a variety of other\r\nsources. As our limits prevent us from entering into the discussion of\r\ncontroverted points, we are under the necessity of merely giving the\r\nresult of our own investigations in each case. Those who wish to see the\r\ncommentator’s opinions more fully on these matters are referred to the\r\nAppendix to Dunbar’s ‘Greek Lexicon,’ which was written exclusively by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈβρότονον,\r\n\r\nAbrotonum, _Southernwood_, warms and dries in the third degree, being\r\nof a discutient and cutting nature, for it is possessed of a very small\r\ndegree of sourness, and if rubbed with oil over the whole body, it cures\r\nperiodical rigors. But it is prejudicial to the stomach; and the burnt\r\nbeing more desiccative than the unburnt, cures alopecia, along with some\r\nof the finer oils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and most of the subsequent authorities, with\r\nthe exception of Paulus, describe two species, the mas. and the femina.\r\nThe one without doubt is the _Artemisia Abrotanum_; the other probably\r\nthe _Santolina Chamæcyparissus_. The use of southernwood is as ancient\r\nas Hippocrates, but Galen is the ancient author who has treated of its\r\nfaculties most elaborately. He recommends it strongly both externally in\r\nfomentations, and internally as an anthelminthic. For the latter purpose\r\nit is praised by the natural historian Ælian (H. A. ix, 33), and by\r\nmost of the medical authorities on the Materia Medica, both ancient and\r\nmodern. As an application in ophthalmy, along with the pulp of a roasted\r\nquince, it is highly spoken of by Galen and the others. Galen says, that\r\nfriction with the oil of southernwood is useful in intermittents, and\r\nthis character of it is confirmed by all the authorities down to recent\r\ntimes. Avicenna joins Dioscorides in praising it as an emmenagogue, and\r\nsays, that it produces abortion. (ii, 266.) Aëtius is fuller than the\r\nothers on the virtues of the lixivial ashes of southernwood, recommending\r\nthem particularly in diseases of the anus and in alopecia. Celsus ranks\r\nit among the cleansing medicines (v, 5.) Pliny makes mention of a vinous\r\ntincture (xiv, 19.) See also Dioscorides (v, 49.) Macer Floridus, a\r\ncomparatively modern authority, joins the more ancient authorities in\r\ncommending it as an antidote to narcotic poisons. He also says, that a\r\nvinous tincture of it is useful in sea-sickness. Serapion, after quoting\r\nfreely from Dioscorides and Galen, under this head adds, upon “an unknown\r\nauthority,” that, when boiled with oil and rubbed over the stomach,\r\nit cures coldness of the same. (De Simpl. 317.) In the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia (Athens, 1837), the two species of wormwood are described by\r\nthe names of _Artemisia Abrotonum_ and _Artemisia contra_. See further\r\nPereira (M. M. 1356.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈγάλλοχον,\r\n\r\nAgallochum, is an Indian wood resembling the thyia, of an aromatic\r\nnature. When chewed it contributes to the fragrance of the mouth. It is\r\nalso a perfume. Its root, when drunk to the amount of a drachm weight,\r\ncures waterbrash and loss of tone in the stomach, and agrees with\r\nhepatic, dysenteric, and pleuritic complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is probably the lignum aloes or _Aloexylon Agallochum_,\r\nLour., although there has been considerable difference of opinion on this\r\npoint. See Gerarde’s ‘Herbal’ and the commentators on Dioscorides and\r\nMesue. Our author’s description of it is taken from Dioscorides (i, 21.)\r\nThe Arabian authorities and Simeon Seth describe several varieties of it;\r\nthe most excellent of which is said to be the Indian. At all times it has\r\nbeen much used in India as a perfume. See in particular Avicenna, who\r\ngives an elaborate dissertation on the different kinds of agallochum or\r\nxylaloe, found in India, and the modes of preparing it (ii, 2, 733.) See\r\nalso Serapion (De Simpl. 197); Ebn Baithar (ii, 224); and Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 27.) It does not occur in the Hippocratic treatises, nor in\r\nthe works of Celsus. Although not retained in our Dispensatory, it is\r\nstill kept in the shops of the apothecaries, and has the reputation of\r\nbeing cordial and alexiterial. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p. 91.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈγαρικὸν,\r\n\r\nAgaricum, _Agaric_, is a root or an excrescence from the trunk of a tree,\r\nof a porous consistence, and composed of aerial and terrene particles.\r\nIt is of a discutient nature, cuts thick humours, and clears away\r\nobstructions, of the viscera particularly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to have been the same as the _Boletus igniarius_\r\n(_touchwood_ or _spunk_), which is still retained in our modern\r\nDispensatories. It is a fungous excrescence which grows on the trunk of\r\nthe oak, larch, cherry, and plum. Dioscorides and most of the ancient\r\nauthorities speak highly of it as a styptic. Dioscorides also commends\r\nit in stomach complaints, but Aëtius maintains that it is prejudicial to\r\nthe stomach. Galen calls it cathartic, and speaks highly of its virtues\r\nin the cure of jaundice and other hepatic affections. (De Simpl. v.)\r\nFor the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2); Serapion (De Simpl. 78); Rhases\r\n(Contin. l. ult. i, 28.) They recommend it in jaundice, like Galen,\r\nand in complaints of the lungs, melancholy, protracted fevers, and in\r\nother cases. It is now seldom used, being found to act harshly both as\r\nan emetic and a cathartic. We have treated of the poisonous agarici in\r\nanother place (v, 64.) The _Boletus Laricis_ occurs in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia. (Athens, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈγήρατον,\r\n\r\nAgeratum, _Maudlin_, is possessed of discutient and slightly\r\nanti-inflammatory powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our modern herbalists are generally agreed that this is our\r\nmaudlin, that is to say, the _Achillea Ageratum_, and the commentators\r\non Mesue hold that it is his eupatorium. From Dioscorides down to modern\r\ntimes it has been commended as a diuretic medicine and an emollient\r\nof the uterus. Dioscorides, however, seems to say that it is heating,\r\nwhereas Galen represents it as mildly anti-inflammatory. Perhaps there\r\nis some error in the text of the former. (iv, 59.) We do not find it in\r\nthe works of Hippocrates, nor in those of Celsus, nor have we found it\r\ntreated of by any of the Arabians, except Ebn Baithar, who merely gives\r\nextracts from Dioscorides and Galen (ii, 57.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌγνος ἢ λύγος,\r\n\r\nVitex, the _Chaste-tree_, heats and dries in the third rank. It consists\r\nof fine particles and dispels flatulence, whence it is believed to\r\ncontribute to chastity, not only when eaten and drunk, but also when\r\nstrewed under one. Its seed also, when drunk, acts as a deobstruent\r\nof the liver and spleen. When toasted it is less flatulent and more\r\ndistributable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The anaphrodisiacal powers of the _Vitex Agnus Castus_, or\r\nchaste-tree, are noticed by most of the medical authorities, and by\r\nÆlian (H. A. ix, 36.) But modern authorities question its claims to this\r\ncharacter. Until lately, however, it held a place in our Pharmacopœia.\r\nOur author abridges Dioscorides (1, 134), and Galen (De Simpl.) For the\r\nArabians, see particularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 43), and Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. 31.) It occurs in the works of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌγρωστις,\r\n\r\nGramen, _Grass_, that of Parnassus is particularly useful; it is\r\ndesiccative, moderately cooling, consists of fine particles, and is\r\nsomewhat sour; it, therefore, is an agglutinant of bloody wounds, and its\r\ndecoction is lithontriptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides treats separately of the agrostis, which\r\nprobably is our couch-grass, or _Triticum repens_, and of the agrostis\r\nin Parnasso, which has been very doubtfully referred to the _Parnassia\r\npalustris_. (iv, 30.) Our author would appear to have confounded these\r\ntwo articles together, and to have applied to the latter the characters\r\nwhich Dioscorides gives to the other. The modern herbalists agree\r\nwith the ancients in commending the couch-grass as being diuretic and\r\nlithontriptic. None of the commentators or herbalists have given a\r\nsatisfactory account of the esculent grass of Galen. The Arabians treat\r\nof the grasses very confusedly. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 704);\r\nRhases (Contin. l. ult. iii, 50); Serapion (c. 119.) In the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia the _Triticum repens_ stands for the ἀ. (p. 72.) Apuleius\r\nsays “Græci agrostem Latini gramen appellant.”\r\n\r\n\r\nἌνχουσαι,\r\n\r\nAnchusæ, _Alkanet_; there are four varieties, all of which are not\r\npossessed of the same powers. For that which is called onoclea has a root\r\nwhich is astringent and somewhat bitter; whence it is useful in splenitic\r\nand nephritic cases. It is a suitable remedy for erysipelas when applied\r\nwith polenta. The leaves are less cooling and desiccative than the root,\r\nand, therefore, they are also drunk for diarrhœa. The lycapsos being more\r\nastringent, agrees in like manner with erysipelas. The onochilos (or\r\nalcibiadios) being possessed of stronger medicinal properties than these,\r\nis beneficial for the bites of vipers, when applied as a cataplasm, as an\r\namulet, and when eaten. The fourth variety being smaller than the others,\r\nhas scarcely got a name: but being more bitter than the alcibiadios, it\r\nis applicable in cases of the broad lumbricus when taken in a draught to\r\nthe extent of an acetabulum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The first species is either the _Anchusa tinctoria L._,\r\nor the _Lithospermum tinctorium_; the lycapsos, the _Echium italicum\r\nL._; the alcibiadios, the _Echium diffusum_, and the fourth species the\r\n_Lithospermum fruticosum_. There is considerable difficulty, however, in\r\ndetermining the alkanets of the ancients. Our author, in his account of\r\nthem, follows Galen, who, in his turn, copies from Dioscorides. Avicenna,\r\nRhases, and Haly Abbas borrow all they say of them from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. The only one of these substances that is retained in our\r\nmodern Pharmacopœias is the _Anchusa tinctoria_, and it is used only\r\nfor colouring. The medicinal virtues of the _Lithospermum_, or of any\r\nspecies of _Echium_, are scarcely recognized. Indeed, as the Anchusa\r\ntinctoria is retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, and as it is\r\nthere stated to be a common plant in Greece, we need have no hesitation\r\nin admitting it to be the common anchusa of the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌδάρκη,\r\n\r\nAdarce is a sort of froth of salt water, collecting about rubbish and\r\nweeds. It is very acrid, and heating almost to burning when applied\r\nexternally with other things; for it cannot be taken internally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The description of this substance given by Dioscorides,\r\nGalen, and the other authorities is substantially the same as our\r\nauthor’s, from which all we can gather is that it was a saline concretion\r\nformed about reeds and herbs in salt lakes. But even Matthiolus confesses\r\nthat he never could satisfy himself that he had found the substance in\r\nquestion, and no modern authority on the Materia Medica has treated of\r\nit. Dioscorides compares it to the _alcyonium_, from which we think it\r\nprobable that the adarce may have been applied to some species of this\r\nzoophyte. See Alcyonium. Dioscorides recommends it for the cure of lepra\r\nand sciatica (v, 136.) The Arabians borrow from him under this head.\r\nSee in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 17); Serapion (c. 378.) It is not\r\nmentioned by Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌδίαντον,\r\n\r\nAdiantum, _Maiden-hair_, is desiccative, attenuant, and moderately\r\ndiscutient; and with regard to heat and cold, it holds an intermediate\r\nplace. It, therefore, cures alopecia, discusses swellings, proves\r\nlithontriptic when taken in a draught, dries up expectorations from the\r\nlungs, and stops defluxions of the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Theophrastus says that it derives its name from its property\r\nof not being wet in rain. He adds, that it promotes the growth of the\r\nhair. (H. P. vii, 13.) Nicander says the same of it. (Ther. 846.)\r\nAccording to Apuleius, it is the same as the callitrichon, polytrichon,\r\nand asplenon. There can be no doubt that it is the _A. Capillus Veneris\r\nL._ Dioscorides describes another species by the name of τριχόμανες,\r\nwhich Sprengel and Schneider agree in referring it to the _Asplenium\r\nTrichomanes L._ Stackhouse agrees with them respecting both these\r\nspecies. The syrup of capillaire, which still holds its place in the\r\nshops as a favorite domestic medicine, is prepared from the _Adiantum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΑΐζωον,\r\n\r\nSempervivum, _Wall-pepper_ (or _House-leek_?), of which there are two\r\nvarieties. It cools in the third degree, is moderately desiccative and\r\nastringent, and is applicable for erysipelas, herpes, and inflammations\r\nfrom a defluxion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author, copying from Galen and Aëtius, describes two\r\nspecies which seem to be the _Sempervivum arboreum_ and _Sedum rupestre_.\r\nDr. Lindley, however, refers the latter to _S. ochroleucum_. Dioscorides\r\nhas a third species, which may be referred to the _Sedum stellatum_.\r\nThe greater house-leek is praised by Dioscorides as an application for\r\nheadache, for the bites of venomous spiders, diarrhœa, and dysentery; as\r\nan anthelminthic when drunk with wine; for stopping the fluor of women\r\nin a pessary, and as an application to the eyes in ophthalmy (iv, 88,\r\n89.) Macer Floridus commends it in menorrhagia. He calls it _acidula_.\r\nSerapion, Avicenna, Rhases, and Haly Abbas merely copy from the Greeks.\r\nEven Ebn Baithar has nothing original under this head. These plants,\r\nalthough not retained in our Dispensatory, are still allowed to possess\r\nmedicinal properties. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 345.) It is still retained\r\nin some of the foreign Dispensatories, and is held to be refrigerant and\r\nastringent.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈετώνυχον,\r\n\r\nÆtonychon will be treated of under the head of _Stones_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈθηρά,\r\n\r\nPulticula, _Pap_, is a kind of puls fit for being supped, which is\r\nprepared from ground spelt or from any corn, and agrees with children. It\r\nanswers also for cataplasms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives the same account of it. It is the _Puls\r\nfritilla_ of Pliny. Matthiolus says it is called _bouillie_ in French, i.\r\ne. _pap_. Hesychius speaks of its being prepared from wheat, and Pliny\r\nfrom rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈιγίλωψ,\r\n\r\nÆgilops, _Cockle_, is possessed of discutient powers, whence it cures\r\nindurated inflammations and ægilops (fistula lachrymalis.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is great difficulty in determining the grasses of\r\nthe ancients. This may be seen by consulting the ‘Herbal’ of Gerarde\r\non this subject. The present article was probably the _Ægilops ovata_.\r\nDioscorides gives nearly the same account of it as our author, who copies\r\nGalen. He further mentions that the juice of it, mixed up with flour and\r\ndried, was laid up for use (iv, 136.) The Arabians borrow closely from\r\nDioscorides. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 211), and Serapion (c.\r\n25.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌιγειρος,\r\n\r\nPopulus nigra, _the Black Poplar_; it is heating in the first degree,\r\nmoderately desiccative, and consists of fine particles. Its leaves, when\r\napplied with vinegar, remove gouty pains; but the resin of it being\r\nhotter than the leaves, is mixed with restorative ointments and emollient\r\nplasters. But its fruit, when drunk with vinegar, is beneficial to\r\nepileptics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Populus nigra_. Our\r\nauthor and all the other authorities, both Greek and Arabian, copy\r\nclosely from Dioscorides (i, 110.) We will have occasion to treat of its\r\ngum or resin afterwards. See Karabe. Celsus does not mention the black\r\npoplar. The αἴγειρος κρητικὴ of Hippocrates was no doubt a variety of\r\n_Populus nigra_. For the Arabians, consult in particular Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n333, 340, 364); Serapion (c. 266); and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 165.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈιδοῖον,\r\n\r\nTesticulus, _the testicle_ of a stag, when dried and triturated with wine\r\nand drunk, is a remedy to those who have been bitten by vipers. It is\r\nalso mixed with compound medicines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sextus Platonicus in like manner recommends the privy parts\r\nof a stag as an antidote for poisons. All copy from Dioscorides (ii, 46.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈιθάλη and λίγνυς will be treated under Λ.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈιθιοπίς,\r\n\r\nSalvia Æthiopis, _Ethiopian Sage_, has leaves like the petty-mullein; and\r\nthe decoction of its root, when drunk, relieves ischiatic and pleuritic\r\ndiseases, hæmoptysis, and asperity of the trachea, when taken with honey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It may be set down as being the _Salvia Æthiopis_, to which\r\nour English herbalist Gerarde gives the English name of mullein of\r\nÆthiopia. Neither Galen nor Aëtius has treated of it. Our author has\r\nborrowed from Dioscorides (iv, 193.) We do not find it in the Materia\r\nMedica of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely\r\ngives an extract from Dioscorides under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nἋιμα,\r\n\r\nSanguis, _Blood_; no kind of it is of a cold nature, but that of swine\r\nis liquid and less hot, being very like the human in temperament. That\r\nof common pigeons, the wood pigeons, and the turtle, being of a moderate\r\ntemperament, if injected hot, removes extravasated blood about the eyes\r\nfrom a blow; and when poured upon the dura mater, in cases of trephining,\r\nit is anti-inflammatory. That of the owl, when drunk with wine or water,\r\nrelieves dyspnœa. The blood of bats, it is said, is a preservative to the\r\nbreasts of virgins, and, if rubbed in, it keeps the hair from growing;\r\nand in like manner also that of frogs, and the blood of the chamæleon\r\nand the dog-tick. But Galen, having made trial of all these remedies,\r\nsays that they disappointed him. But that of goats, owing to its dryness,\r\nif drunk with milk, is beneficial in cases of dropsy, and breaks down\r\nstones in the kidneys. That of domestic fowls stops hemorrhages of the\r\nmembranes of the brain, and that of lambs cures epilepsies. The recently\r\ncoagulated blood of kids, if drunk with an equal quantity of vinegar, to\r\nthe amount of half a hemina, cures vomiting of blood from the chest. The\r\nblood of bears, of wild goats, of buck goats, and of bulls, is said to\r\nripen apostemes. That of the land crocodile produces acuteness of vision.\r\nThe blood of stallions is mixed with septic medicines. The antidote from\r\nbloods is given for deadly poisons, and contains the blood of the duck,\r\nof the stag, and of the goose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author abridges this article from Galen. See also in\r\nparticular Serapion (De Simpl. ex Animalibus.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌιρα,\r\n\r\nLolium, _Darnel_, is heating and drying, almost in the third degree,\r\nbeing equal in power to the iris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This, which is the _Zizanien_ of the Arabians, may be set\r\ndown as the _Lolium temulentum_. Dioscorides gives the fullest account of\r\nits medicinal faculties; he recommends it along with radishes and salt as\r\nan application to gangrenous and spreading sores, and with sulphur and\r\nvinegar for lichen and lepra; when boiled with pigeon’s dung and linseed\r\nin wine for discussing strumous and indolent tumours; for ischiatic\r\ndisease boiled with mulse and applied as a cataplasm; and used in a\r\nfumigation with myrrh, saffron, and frankincense, he says it promotes\r\nconception (ii, 122.) Aëtius says, it is more acrid but less attenuant\r\nthan iris. We have not been able to find it noticed in the works of\r\nHippocrates nor in those of Celsus. The Arabians merely copy Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. See Serapion (c. 70); and Avicenna (ii, 2, 658.) Our old\r\nEnglish herbalists repeat the ancient characters of this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈκαλλίς\r\n\r\nis the fruit of a shrub growing in Egypt, the decoction of which is an\r\ningredient in the Collyria, for promoting acuteness of vision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen and Aëtius have not treated of this article. Our author\r\ncopies from Dioscorides, who, under the name of ἀκακαλὶς, describes it\r\nas an Egyptian plant, resembling the myrica (i, 118.) We may therefore\r\nconjecture, with considerable probability, that it is merely some species\r\nor variety of the tamarix. It does not appear that it is treated of by\r\nthe Arabians, nor have we found it in the works of Hippocrates or Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈκακία,\r\n\r\nAcacia is of the third order of desiccants, and of the first of cooling\r\nmedicines; but if washed, of the second. It is sour and terrene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes the acacia as being a thorny tree or\r\nshrub, not erect, having a white flower and fruit like lupine, inclosed\r\nin pods, from which is expressed the juice that is afterwards dried in\r\nthe shade (i, 133.) It was much disputed among the older commentators on\r\nDioscorides whether or not this description applies to the _Acacia vera_;\r\nbut since the time of Prosper Alpinus, it has been generally decided in\r\nthe affirmative by all scholars, with the exception of Dierbach, who\r\ncontends in favour of the _A. Senegal_, without any good reason, as\r\nfar as we can see. This gum was used medicinally by the authors of the\r\nHippocratic collection, who prescribe it as an astringent in hemorrhages,\r\nfor which purpose it is also recommended by Celsus (v. 1.) Serapion and\r\nthe others merely copy from Dioscorides and Galen. See in particular\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈκαλύφη,\r\n\r\nUrtica, _the Nettle_; the fruit and leaves are composed of fine\r\nparticles, and are desiccative without pungency; they dispel and cleanse\r\nswellings, loosen the bowels, are moderately flatulent, and therefore\r\nincite to venery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article is either the _Urtica dioica_, or the\r\n_pilulifera_; or both species were comprehended under it. In the modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia, the _pilulifera_ stands first (p. 164.) Galen, like\r\nour author, calls it aphrodisiacal. Macer Floridus recommends it strongly\r\nas being calefacient and stimulant. Both Dioscorides and Galen agree\r\nin commending it as an expectorant when the chest is loaded with thick\r\nhumours. The Arabians treat of it at considerable length. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 714); Serapion (c. 150); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.; 152.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌκανθος,\r\n\r\nAcanthus, _Bears-breech_ (called also Melamphyllon and Pæderos), has\r\ndiscutient and desiccative powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the plant which our English herbalists describe by the\r\nname of Bears-breech, now called the _Acanthus mollis_ by botanists.\r\nDioscorides recommends it as being diuretic, and astringent of the\r\nbowels (iii, 17.) Our author follows Galen. Whether “gummi acanthinum”\r\nof Celsus (v, 2) belong to this place, or not rather to the acacia, as\r\nMilligan suggests, we cannot determine for certain. Modern authorities\r\nhave confirmed the characters which the ancients ascribed to it. (See\r\nRutty, M. M. p. 70); Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p. 45.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΑκάνθιον,\r\n\r\nAcanthium, is composed of fine particles, and has heating powers,\r\ntherefore it is a remedy for convulsions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Gerarde and our other herbalists delineate and describe\r\nthis plant under the name of the cotton-thistle, meaning either the\r\n_Onopordon acanthium_ or _O. Illyricum_, cotton-thistle. Dioscorides\r\naffirms that it is of service to persons affected with tetanus, and upon\r\nhis authority all the others, both ancient and modern, ascribe virtues to\r\nit in this case. The reader may be amused by comparing what Gerarde and\r\nCulpeper have written of it with the ancient descriptions of Dioscorides\r\nand Pliny. The cotton-thistle was long used as a potherb. See Beckmann\r\n(History of Inventions, under ARTICHOKE); and Loudon (Encycl. of Garden,\r\np. 736.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌκανθα λευκή,\r\n\r\nSpina alba, _the White-thorn_. Its root is desiccative and moderately\r\nastringent, therefore it relieves stomachic complaints, hæmoptysis,\r\nand toothache; but its seed, consisting of fine particles, and being\r\nof a hot nature, when drunk relieves convulsions. Acantha Ægyptia, or\r\nArabica, _the Egyptian or Arabic thorn_, is possessed of very astringent\r\nand desiccative powers. Whence it restrains a flow of blood and other\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Respecting the two thistles here described, we may refer\r\nthe former, with Sibthorp, to the _Cirsium Acarna_, and the latter,\r\nor Arabian, to the _Onopordon acanthium_. All the authorities follow\r\nDioscorides in giving its characters. (iii, 12.) See Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n671-3); Serapion (c. 130); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 670.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌκινος,\r\n\r\nAcinus; it resembles basil, and is moderately astringent, therefore it\r\nrestrains alvine and uterine discharges, when taken in a draught; and\r\nwhen applied as a cataplasm, is of use for erysipelas and phygethlon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our old herbalists describe it under the name of wild basil,\r\nmeaning perhaps the _Ocimum pilosum_, and there seems little reason to\r\nquestion their authority in this instance. Neither Galen nor Serapion\r\nhas described it. Indeed we are not aware that any of the Arabians has\r\ndescribed it except Ebn Baithar (ii, 254); neither have we found it in\r\nthe Hippocratic collection, nor in the works of Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΑκόνιτον or Παρδαλιαγχὲς,\r\n\r\nAconitum, _Wolfsbane_, is possessed of septic and deleterious properties;\r\nit is, therefore, not to be taken internally, but externally it may be\r\napplied to flesh requiring erosion. The lycoctonon, being possessed of\r\nthe same properties as the former, is particularly fatal to wolves, as\r\nthe other is to panthers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The two species of aconite described by Dioscorides (iv,\r\n77), and the other authorities, are generally supposed to be the\r\n_Doronicum Pardalianches_ and the _Aconitum Napellus_. In the modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia, the _Neomontanum_ is substituted for the former of\r\nthese. The κάμμαρον of Hippocrates would seem to be the latter. It has\r\nbeen already treated of among the poisonous substances in the Fifth Book\r\n(§ 45.) It was used only as an anodyne, and principally in complaints\r\nof the eyes. Avicenna in treating of the aconites, borrows closely from\r\nDioscorides (ii, 2, 361, 676.) He says of the lycoctonon, that it is not\r\nadministered either internally or externally. Rhases says of the aconite,\r\nthat it was used to relieve pains of the eyes. (Cont. l. ult. i, 20.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌκορον,\r\n\r\nAcorum, _Sweet Flag_, heats and dries in the third degree. We use its\r\nroot for a diuretic, and for scirrhus of the spleen. It also attenuates a\r\nthickened cornea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears indisputably to be the _Acorus pseudacorus_,\r\nas even Gerarde the old herbalist has clearly stated, and not the\r\n_Acorus verus_, as Dr. Hill and others have maintained. All the ancient\r\nauthorities ascribe much the same virtues to it as our author. See\r\nparticularly Dioscorides (i, 2); Avicenna (ii, 2, 45); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. 21); Serapion (c. 269.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is\r\nidentified with the κάλαμος ἁρωματικός (p. 32.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈκρίδες,\r\n\r\nLocustæ, _Grasshoppers_, in fumigations relieve dysuria, especially of\r\nwomen. The wingless grasshopper, when drunk in wine, relieves the bite of\r\nscorpions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is quite certain that the Ἀκρὶς of the Greeks, and\r\nthe _Locusta_ of the Romans was a species of locust or grasshopper.\r\nSee Harduin (ad Plin. H. N. xi, 35.) Without doubt, then, it was the\r\n_Gryllus migratorius L._ The wingless locusta mentioned by our author is\r\nthe insect in its larvous state. Our author copies from, and abridges,\r\nDioscorides (ii, 56); and Avicenna does the same (ii, 2, 388.) Celsus\r\ntreats of the locusta only as an article of food (ii, 28.) In this way,\r\nas is well known, the locusts were much used by the ancients. They are\r\nnot noticed, however, either as an article of food or of medicine in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌκτη μεγάλη,\r\n\r\nSambucus, _the Elder-tree_, and Χαμαιάκτη, Sambucus humilis _vel_ Ebulus,\r\n_Dwarf-elder_, are possessed of desiccative, moderately discutient and\r\nagglutinative powers. When eaten or drunk they occasion a discharge of\r\nwater from the bowels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The two species of elder, namely, the _Sambucus nigra_ and\r\n_Ebulus_, are much commended by the ancients for the cure of dropsy.\r\nAs Dioscorides states, the elder is hydragogue, but disagrees with the\r\nstomach. He further recommends a hip-bath made of water in which elder\r\nhas been boiled, for obstructions and hardness of the uterus (iv, 161.)\r\nGalen and the other Greek authorities treat of it in general terms like\r\nPaulus. The Arabians in treating of it generally borrow from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. See particularly Serapion (c. 284.) It appears to be the\r\n_acte_ of Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 23); and is the _aktha_ of Ebn\r\nBaithar, according to his German translator, Dr. Sontheimer, in which\r\nopinion we fully agree with him. The Sambucus of Avicenna (ii, 2, 611)\r\nis not the elder, but the jasmine. We have not been able to detect the\r\nother in his Book on the Mat. Med., but can scarcely suppose that he has\r\nentirely overlooked it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἍλες,\r\n\r\nSales, _Salts_, have desiccant and astringent powers. Wherefore they\r\nconsume whatever humours are in the body, and also contract by their\r\nastringency. Whence they form pickles, and preserve substances from\r\nputrefaction. Roasted salts are more discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For an account of the factitious salts of the ancients, see\r\nin particular Pliny (H. N. xxxi, 39.) Sprengel remarks that the ἅλος\r\nἄχνη, or _spuma maris_, is merely the skum or down of salt, which sticks\r\nto rocks in such situations as salt is usually formed in. The ἅλος\r\nἂνθος, or _flos salis_, he adds, is a very different substance, being a\r\nnative, impure carbonate of soda; containing also magnesia, lime, and\r\nsome terrene admixture, to which it owes its colour. When deprived of\r\nits carbonic acid it becomes caustic, and was then called ἄφρος νίτρου\r\nby the ancients (v. ἀφρόνιτρον.) The _sal ammoniac_ of the Greeks was\r\na native fossil salt, and considerably different from ours. Geoffroy\r\nseems to agree with Salmasius, that it was the _sal gem_. Dr. Hill also\r\nmaintains that it was only a peculiar form of the sal gem. See also\r\nJameson’s ‘Mineral.’ (iii, 15.) In fact, from Dioscorides’ description of\r\nthe ammoniac salt, nobody can avoid seeing that it was merely a variety\r\nof the common fossil salt. He treats of the medicinal faculties of the\r\nsalts at so great length that we dare not venture to copy his account of\r\nthem. It is literally translated by Pliny (xxxi, 45.) He recommends them\r\ninternally by the mouth and in clysters, and externally in fomentations,\r\nbaths, and fumigations. Serapion quotes the whole of Dioscorides’ chapter\r\non Salts without supplying much additional information of his own. He\r\ndescribes minutely the process of roasting salts in an earthen vessel,\r\nand covering them up with coals, and thus applying heat to them. The\r\n_sal ammoniac_ he describes, from Arabian authorities, as being a white\r\nred salt, extracted from hard clear stones, and being saltish, with much\r\npungency (c. 409.) We never could altogether satisfy ourselves whether or\r\nnot this be the same as the sal ammoniac of the Greeks. Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. 600) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 608) are brief and indistinct in\r\ndescribing the sal ammoniac, but probably refer to the true sal ammoniac.\r\nEbn Baithar minutely describes several kinds of it. Pliny also has a\r\ndescription of a factitious salt, which it would appear could be nothing\r\nelse than our sal ammoniac. (N. H. xxxvi, 45.) Still, however, we need\r\nhave no hesitation in setting down the ammoniac salt of the Greek medical\r\nauthors as being a variety of the sal gem. This is the conclusion which\r\nBeckmann arrives at regarding it: he holds, however, that Geber and\r\nAvicenna were certainly acquainted with our ammoniac salt. (History of\r\nInventions.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈλθάια ἢ Ἐβίσκος,\r\n\r\nAlthæa or Ebiscus, _Marsh-mallows_, is a species of wild mallows. It is\r\ndiscutient, relaxant, anti-inflammatory, soothing, and ripens tumours\r\n(phymata). But the root and seed have all the other properties in a\r\nmore intense degree, and are also detergent of alphos. The seed is\r\nlithontriptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This must either be the _Lavatera arborea_ or _Althæa\r\nofficinalis_. Dioscorides is much fuller than our author in enumerating\r\nits properties, but upon the whole they agree very well as to its\r\ngeneral character. Besides the cases in which our author recommends\r\nit, Dioscorides speaks highly of the decoction of it when drunk with\r\nwine in dysuria, the grievous pains of calculus, dysentery, and other\r\nacute affections. He also advises the mouth to be rinsed with it in\r\ncases of toothache (iii, 153.) It would be useless to go over the other\r\nauthorities, who supply no new views. Even our modern herbalists all\r\nagree in repeating the praises of the marsh-mallow as delivered by\r\nDioscorides. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 72); Serapion (c.\r\n76); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 26); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) This genus\r\nof the _Malvaceæ_ does not seem to be noticed either by Hippocrates or\r\nCelsus. The _Althæa officinalis_ occurs in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia,\r\npublished at Athens in 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nἍλιμον,\r\n\r\nHalimon consists of heterogeneous particles, being saltish and\r\nsub-astringent. But the greater part of it is of a hot temperament, with\r\nan undigested sap. It therefore promotes the formation of milk and semen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author abridges the characters of this substance, which\r\nprobably is the _Atriplex Halimus_, from Galen or Dioscorides (i, 126.)\r\nIt is the sea-purslane of our English herbalists. For the Arabians, see\r\nparticularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 470.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἉλκάια,\r\n\r\nAlcæa, _Vervain-mallow_, is a species of wild mallows. When drunk\r\nwith wine it removes dysenteries and gnawing pains of the belly, more\r\nparticularly its root.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the authorities agree in giving this article, which\r\nevidently is the _Malva Alcæa_, Vervain-mallow, the general characters of\r\nthe mallow. See particularly Dioscorides (iii, 154.) It does not occur\r\nin the works either of Hippocrates or Celsus, nor, as far as we know, in\r\nthose of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nἉλκυονία,\r\n\r\nAlcyonia; they are detergent and discutient of all matters, being\r\npossessed of an acrid quality; but the kind called milesium (it is\r\nvermiform and purple) is the best: wherefore, when burnt, it cures\r\nalopecia, and cleanses lichen and alphos. That which has a smooth surface\r\nis most acrid, proving not only detergent, but likewise excoriating; but\r\nthat which resembles unwashed wool is the weakest of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For an account of the alcyonia, see Aristot. (Hist. Anim. ix,\r\n15); Pliny (N. H. x, 47, and xxxii, 27.) According to Sprengel, the A.\r\nconsisted of the bones of fishes which the kingfishers had swallowed and\r\nvomited up. The term, however, was also applied to a kind of zoophytes,\r\nfive species of which are described by Dioscorides and Pliny. The 1st\r\nspecies is the _Alcyonium cotoneum_, Pall.; the 2d, the _A. papillosum_;\r\nthe 3d, the _A. palmatum_; the 4th, the _Spongia stuposa_, Ellis, or\r\n_Spongia panicea_, Pall.; and the 5th, the _A. aurantium_, Pall. (Mat.\r\nMed. v, 135.) Geoffroy says that the alcyonia “are of a substance much\r\nlike gum tragacanth, and when mixed in broth of warm milk they swell and\r\nmake a rich soup.” The zoophytes called alcyonia are a kind of spongy\r\nsubstances, containing a sort of living jelly in their interior. Our\r\nauthor abridges Dioscorides’ account of the _alcyonia_, as likewise\r\ndo Avicenna (ii, 2, 605) and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 1, 677.) Celsus\r\nprescribes it several times as a corrosive, caustic, and cleansing\r\nmedicine. (v, 6, 7, 18.) We believe it does not occur in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\n\r\nἍλμη,\r\n\r\nMuria, _Brine_; that which is unmixed with other matter has properties\r\nlike salts, only weaker from the mixture with water. But the brine of\r\npickled fish and of pickled olives is possessed of very detergent powers,\r\nand therefore is injected in ischiatic and dysenteric complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Regarding the nature of this article, there can be no doubt.\r\nGalen recommends the brine from pickled fish as a wash for putrid ulcers\r\nboth of the mouth and rectum. Dioscorides, in addition, recommends it for\r\nsuch cases as sea-water is useful in, when poured upon the part. (v, 126.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈλόη,\r\n\r\nAloe, _Aloes_, is heating in the first degree, and desiccative in the\r\nthird. It is stomachic, detergent, discutient, and eccoprotic. When\r\nwashed it is less detergent, but more stomachic; it is anti-inflammatory,\r\nand promotes the cicatrization of ulcers, especially those about the anus\r\nand pudendum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides is the first author who gives a distinct account\r\nof this important article. He describes two varieties of the juice\r\n(gum-resin), namely, the arenaceous and the hepatic. He says that it\r\ncloses up the mouths of veins in hemorrhoids; but, according to Avicenna\r\nand Mesue, it produces the contrary effect. Hence, says Mesue, it is\r\nhurtful in hemorrhoids and affections of the fundament. (De Simpl.\r\ni.) Galen properly remarks that it is at the same time stomachic and\r\neccoprotic. Didymus mentions the hepatic aloe (Geopon. vi, 6), as do\r\nseveral of the medical authorities. It is marked by Dr. Pereira as\r\nbeing the _Aloe hepatica vera_ and _Aloe indica_ (Ph. Ed.), being the\r\nliver-coloured socotorine aloe. That is to say, the hepatic is merely a\r\nvariety of the socotorine aloe. See also Dr. Royle (M. M. 598.) Isidorus\r\nsays of aloes: “In India et Arabia gignitur, arbor odoris suavissimi\r\net summi.” (Orig.) Averrhoes says it is an excellent purgative which\r\nevacuates the stomach and liver. He commends it as an application to\r\napostemes. (Collig. v, 42.) Aloe was used in stimulant applications to\r\nill-conditioned sores. See Aëtius. Avicenna forbids us to administer\r\nit during the prevalence of severe cold. (ii, 2, 64.) It was used in\r\neye-washes (Cels. vi), as it is by the native doctors in India to this\r\nday. (Ainslie’s Mat. Ind. i, 10.) The aloe is not found in the Materia\r\nMedica of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nἉλὸς ἄνθος,\r\n\r\nFlos salis, _the Flower of Salt_, is a humid medicine, consisting of\r\nmore subtile particles than burnt salts, and is moderately acrid and\r\ndiscutient.\r\n\r\n\r\nἉλὸς ἄχνη,\r\n\r\nSpuma maris; this is a frothy efflorescence of salts, but consists of\r\nmore subtile particles than salts, and discusses more, but contracts less.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. (Ἁλὸς ἄνθος and Ἁλὸς ἄχνη, see Ἃλες.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈλσίνη, or μυὸς ὂυς,\r\n\r\nAlsine, or Auricula muris, _Chickweed_, has powers like the pellitory of\r\nthe wall, namely, cold and diluent. Wherefore it is applicable to hot\r\ninflammations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This has been generally set down as the _Stellaria media_,\r\nbut doubtfully. Dioscorides describes it as a _Myosotis_. (ii, 214.) See\r\nalso Pliny (H. N. xxvii, 8), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 18.)\r\n\r\nOur old herbalists give a confused account of the chickweed. In fact,\r\nthis is one of the articles in the Materia Medica of the ancients which\r\nwe must set down as _lost_, from our inability to determine what it\r\nwas. It seems to have been looked upon by the Arabians as an important\r\narticle. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 18); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 99.) Like\r\nour author, they copy closely from Dioscorides. We have not detected it\r\nin the works either of Hippocrates or Celsus. It does not occur in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌλυπον,\r\n\r\nAlypon; the seed of it purges black bile downwards when taken in the same\r\nquantity as dodder of thyme, with salts and vinegar; but it occasions\r\nslight ulceration of the intestines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Many of the older commentators supposed this to be the\r\nplant which produces turbit, but we shall have occasion to discuss this\r\nquestion when treating of the additions to the Materia Medica made by the\r\nArabians. What this article really was is very uncertain. Pliny and all\r\nthe medical authorities mention its purgative powers. See in particular\r\nDioscorides (iv, 177), from whom our author evidently copies.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌλυσσον,\r\n\r\nAlysson, _Madwort_, is so called because it is of use to those who have\r\nbeen bitten by mad dogs. Being possessed of discutient, detergent, and\r\ndesiccative powers, it removes obstructions of the kidneys, and cleanses\r\nephelis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It was supposed by the earlier herbalists and commentators\r\nthat the A. of Galen is a different substance from that of Dioscorides.\r\nThe former (which is also our author’s) is a species of horehound, to\r\nwhich the herbalists give the distinctive name of Galen’s madwort. It\r\nis the _Marrubium Alyssum_. That of Dioscorides has been conjectured to\r\nhave been some species of _Veronica_, but, in fact, there is no certainty\r\non this point, and we must own our inability to perceive the difference\r\nbetween it and the A. of Galen. Dioscorides recommends his plant in\r\nephelis and hydrophobia, (iii, 95.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈλώπηξ,\r\n\r\nVulpes, _the Fox_; the whole animal, if boiled alive or dead, renders the\r\noil discutient, when it attracts the deep-seated fluids to the surface.\r\nWherefore, when arthritic patients are put into a hip-bath of this oil\r\nfor a considerable time it removes the complaint entirely, if at its\r\ncommencement, and moderates it if protracted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen and Serapion give nearly the same account of the\r\nmedicinal properties of the _Canis vulpes_ as our author.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμάρακος,\r\n\r\nAmaracus, _Marjoram_; it is calefacient in the third degree, and\r\ndesiccative in the second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it was some species of marjoram appears quite certain\r\nfrom the ancient descriptions of it; but, otherwise, it cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily determined. Most probably, it was the same as the\r\nsampsuchus, namely, the _Origanum Marjorana_. Dioscorides strongly\r\nrecommends the ointment as an emmenagogue, and for various other\r\npurposes. (i, 78.) For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 466); Serapion\r\n(c. 286); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 439.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμάραντον,\r\n\r\nAmarantum, _Amaranth_, is attenuant and incisive, and therefore when\r\ntaken with wine it promotes the menstrual discharge, and dissolves\r\ncoagulated blood when taken with wine and honey. It dries up all\r\ndefluxions, and is bad for the stomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The old herbalists describe a plant under the English name\r\nof Flower-gentle, which they represent to be this article, but it\r\ncannot be satisfactorily determined. Our author borrows from Galen and\r\nAëtius his account of its medicinal properties, which certainly appears\r\nrather contradictory. How a plant, which they represent as being of a\r\ndrying nature, should at the same time act as an emmenagogue, does not\r\nwell appear. Our English herbalist Gerarde sagaciously remarks that it\r\nhas probably got the character of stopping bleeding solely from its\r\nears being red, as if, forsooth, all red things must act in this way;\r\nalthough, as he adds, Galen had laid it down as a rule (Simpl. 2, 4) that\r\nno inference with regard to the virtues of substances can be drawn from\r\ntheir colours. But see under _helicrysus_, which Dioscorides holds to be\r\nthe same plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμβροσία,\r\n\r\nAmbrosia; when applied as a cataplasm it has astringent and repellent\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Ambrosia, as Pliny remarks (H. N. xxvii, 11), is a vague name\r\nwhich has been applied to various plants. Our old herbalists describe a\r\nplant under the English name of Oak of Cappadocia, which they represent\r\nas the A. of Dioscorides. He gives it the same medicinal character as our\r\nauthor (iii.) Galen and Aëtius do the same. It probably is the _Ambrosia\r\nmaritima_, a plant not yet wholly unknown to the shops. See Gray (Suppl.\r\nto Pharmacop. p. 70.) We have not found it described by any of the\r\nArabians except Ebn Baithar (i, 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌμμι,\r\n\r\nAmmi, _Bishop’s Weed_, is of the third order of calefacients and\r\ndesiccants, being composed of subtile particles, discutient and diuretic;\r\nbut the seed of it is particularly useful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Ammi copticum_, or Bishop’s weed, has long held a\r\nplace in the Materia Medica, and yet it is now scarcely recognized.\r\nSee Dioscorides (iii, 63); Galen (De Simpl. v); Avicenna (ii, 2, 60);\r\nSerapion (c. 297.) It is now ranked as one of the four lesser hot seeds,\r\nand is held to be attenuant, aperient, and carminative. In a word, all\r\nthe authorities, ancient and modern, agree in giving it the characters\r\nbestowed upon it by Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμΐαντον,\r\n\r\nLapis Amiantus, is formed in Cyprus, being like stone-alum, and is so\r\ncalled because when put into the fire it is not burnt. Some use it in\r\ndesiccative depilatories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is generally confounded with the _Alumen plumosum_,\r\nwith which it is compared by Dioscorides, but it is in fact a different\r\nsubstance, being a variety of asbestus. Dioscorides does not mention any\r\nmedicinal properties of which it is possessed, but states that garments\r\nwere made out of it, which resisted the force of fire. (M. M. v, 155.)\r\nSee also Pliny (H. N. xix, 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌμμος,\r\n\r\nArena, _Sand_; that on the sea-shore is sufficiently desiccative.\r\nWherefore when heated by the sun it dries up all humid bodies which have\r\nbeen buried in it; and when roasted it forms a dry fomentation instead of\r\nmillet or salts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _The Sand of the Sea-shore._ We have often had occasion,\r\nin the course of this work, to mention the use of heated sand as a dry\r\nfomentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμμωνιακὸν θυμίαμα,\r\n\r\nAmmoniacum thymiama, _Ammoniac Perfume_, is a juice of intense emollient\r\npowers, so as to dissolve scirrhous tumours and tofi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes the ammoniac as being the juice of a\r\nFerula growing near Cyrene, and mentions afterwards that an inferior\r\nkind is also obtained from a tree of the reed tribe in Lybia, near\r\nAmmon. The reed which produces the better kind is now called the _Ferula\r\ntingitana_. Whether the inferior kind be the commercial ammoniacum of\r\nthe present day, which is procured from the _Dorema ammoniacum_, does\r\nnot appear certain. Dr. Hill holds that the ancients were acquainted\r\nwith the two kinds which we have. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is\r\nquestioned whether it is the product of the _Heracleum gummiferum_, or\r\n_Ferula orientalis_. The _thymiama_, or _suffimentum_, was the finest\r\nkind of ammoniac, and was so called from being used in religious rites.\r\nDioscorides recommends ammoniac for many medicinal purposes, both\r\ninternally and externally; as for loosening the bowels when taken in a\r\ndraught; for asthma and other affections of the chest when given as a\r\nlinctus with honey; for indurations of the spleen and liver when applied\r\nin the form of a cataplasm; and for nebulæ of the cornea. (iii, 88.)\r\nGalen gives nearly the same characters of it. Serapion quotes Dioscorides\r\nand Galen, and adds a few other particulars of not much importance from\r\nArabian authorities, such as that it is diuretic and emmenagogue, and\r\nexpels humours from the body. (c. 268.) Rhases, Avicenna, Ebn Baithar,\r\nand Haly Abbas supply no additional information of any interest under\r\nthis head. Averrhoes commends it as a medicine which softens and\r\ndissolves hard tumours. (Collig. v, 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμόργη,\r\n\r\nAmurca, _the Lees of Oil_, is of the second order of intensely\r\ncalefacient, and desiccative medicines. By these means it cures ulcers in\r\ndry bodies, but increases and exasperates those in others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _amurca_, as Dioscorides states, is the sediment of\r\nstrained oil. Celsus mentions it often as a strong external application,\r\nin which form it is greatly commended by Dioscorides in various\r\naffections. He says it is an article in collyria and plasters. He also\r\nspeaks of its being used as an injection into the rectum, the urethra,\r\nand the vagina, in diseases of these parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμπελόπρασον,\r\n\r\nAmpeloprasum, _Vine-leek_, being a species of wild leek, is most acrid\r\nand hot according to the last degree: hence it proves deleterious. It is\r\nincisive, deobstruent, and hurtful to the stomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Allium Ampeloprasum_ L. is recommended by Dioscorides as\r\nbeing more powerfully calefacient and emmenagogue than the leek (_Allium\r\nPorrum_); and when given in food, beneficial to persons stung by venomous\r\nanimals. Our author follows Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌμπελος ἀγρία,\r\n\r\nVitis sylvestris, _the Wild Vine_; its grapes and tops are possessed\r\nof detergent powers, but have also some astringency. The powers of the\r\n_cultivated vine_ are like those of the wild, but weaker. The shoots\r\nof the _white vine_ (called also bryonia and psilothrum) are eaten as\r\nstomachics, and prove diuretic. The root is detergent, attenuant, and\r\nmoderately hot. Wherefore it melts down the spleen when drunk or applied\r\nexternally as a cataplasm with figs; and it cures itch and leprosy. The\r\nblack vine, also called bryony, is like the aforementioned, only weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The wild vine is evidently the _Tamus communis_; the white\r\nthe _Bryonia dioica_; and the black the _Bryonia alba_. Gerarde, our old\r\nherbalist, says that the reason why the bryony and the wild vine are\r\nconfounded together, is that Pliny could not sufficiently expound them\r\n(xxiii, 1), and made them all one, in which error are all the Arabians.\r\nDioscorides treats of them at considerable length, and more especially of\r\nthe white, which he commends in the strongest terms, as an application\r\nto malignant and ill-conditioned sores. (iv, 180.) He and Oribasius take\r\nnotice of its purgative powers. Our modern herbalists and older writers\r\non the Materia Medica, all treat of the bryonies in the same terms as the\r\nancient authorities. See _Bryonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈμὐγδαλα,\r\n\r\nAmygdalæ, _Almonds_; the bitter are possessed of powers which are\r\nattenuant and deobstruent of deep-seated viscid and thick humours, and\r\ndetergent of those lodged in the skin. The wood has the same powers. The\r\nsweet are moderately hot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Respecting this article there can be no difference of\r\nopinion. Plutarch and many of the ancient authorities take notice of\r\nthe powers of almonds in resisting intoxication. Dioscorides states\r\nthat a cataplasm formed from almonds, with vinegar or rose oil, and\r\napplied to the forehead or temples relieves headache. Taken internally,\r\nhe says, they are laxative, soporific, and diuretic. (i, 186.) Serapion\r\ngives nearly the same account of them. (c. 82.) Dioscorides greatly\r\ncommends almond oil as a demulcent in various complaints, such as\r\npains, inflammation, and displacement of the uterus, also in headache\r\nand earache, in nephritic, calculous, and other diseases. (i, 38.)\r\nAvicenna gives it the same character, and otherwise enlarges very fully\r\nin recapitulating the virtues of almonds. As an article of food, he\r\nsays, bitter almonds are stomachic, and sweet almonds are fattening.\r\nHe recommends them as an application to herpes and other diseases of\r\nthe skin. Bitter almonds he speaks highly of in obstructions of the\r\nkidneys. Altogether the account which he gives of this article is most\r\ninteresting. (ii, 257.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 45); Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 42.) The latter recommends them as powerful deobstruents of\r\nthe liver.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌμυλον,\r\n\r\nAmylum, _Starch_, is formed from clean wheat moistened with water during\r\nthe heat of the dog-days, which water is to be poured off five times in\r\nthe day. When it becomes very soft, it is to be strained and the water\r\npoured off, and the bran separated; and it is to be dried quickly in the\r\nsun before it become sour. Its powers are moderately cooling, desiccant,\r\nand emollient of acrid humours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the mode of preparing starch is\r\nmostly taken from Dioscorides (ii, 123.) Pliny describes the process\r\nin nearly the same terms. He says, it may be prepared from wheat or\r\nspelt. (H. N. xxviii, 17.) He calls it astringent, and recommends it\r\nin hæmoptysis. Serapion also recommends it in this complaint. (c. 29.)\r\nCelsus ranks it among the “res boni succi.” (ii, 20.) It is mentioned\r\nby Hippocrates, who recommends it as an application to the mouth of the\r\nwomb. (De Mulieb. ii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌμωμον,\r\n\r\nAmomum; its powers are like those of the sweet-flag; but the former is\r\nthe drier, and the latter more digestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For the general literature of this subject, we would beg\r\nto refer to what we have said in the Appendix to the Greek Lexicon.\r\nNotwithstanding all the illustration which it has received, it must be\r\nadmitted that now we have no practical acquaintance with the article in\r\nquestion, unless we agree with Dr. Pereira in setting it down as the\r\n_Amomum Cardamomum_. This opinion, however, which had been previously\r\nstated by Feæus (Flor. Virg. xvi, 199), is controverted by the learned\r\nSprengel. (ad Dioscor. i, 14.) But still if the cardamom be not exactly\r\nthe amomum of the ancients, there can be no doubt that these two\r\nsubstances must have been very similar to one another. Dioscorides treats\r\nmore fully of this article than Galen, Aëtius, Oribasius, or our author,\r\ndescribing it as being calefacient, astringent, desiccative, soporific,\r\nand anodyne when applied in a plaster to the forehead, and stating that\r\nit ripens and discusses boils and meliceris, proves useful to persons\r\nstung by scorpions, in a cataplasm with basil; relieves gouty persons,\r\nsoothes inflammations of the eyes, and those in the bowels, with raisins;\r\nthat it is useful in female complaints, in the form of a hip-bath, and\r\nthat the decoction of it is fitting in cases of nephritis, hepatitis,\r\nand gout. (i, 14.) Serapion quotes the descriptions of it given by\r\nDioscorides and Galen, and adds, upon the authority of Humaim, the son\r\nof Isaac, that it is possessed of inebriating and soporific powers. (c.\r\n279.) Avicenna’s account of it is made up from Dioscorides, Galen, and\r\nSerapion (ii, 251.) Haly Abbas recommends the decoction of it (_hamama_)\r\nin diseases of the liver and kidneys. Celsus includes both the amomum\r\nand cardamomum (which, by the way, seems decidedly to prove that they\r\nwere not _exactly_ the same thing) among the ingredients of an emollient\r\nplaster (_malagma_) which he describes, and which he recommends as an\r\nexcellent application to abscesses, and various schirrous tumours.\r\n(v, 18, 7.) It does not occur, we believe, in the Materia Medica of\r\nHippocrates; at least we have failed to detect it while writing this\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈναγαλλὶς,\r\n\r\nAnagallis, _Pimpernel_; both kinds are of sufficiently detergent powers,\r\nhaving some hottish and attractive properties, so that they extract\r\nthorns; and the juice of it purges by the nose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These two well-known plants, namely, the _Anagallis arvensis_\r\nand _cærulea_, are included in all the ancient lists of medicinal herbs,\r\nand were only of late excluded from our British Pharmacopœias. All\r\nthe authorities, ancient and modern, give them the same characters as\r\nDioscorides, to whom our author is principally indebted. (ii, 209.) He\r\nsays they are useful in diseases of the kidneys and liver. (l. c.) The\r\nanagallis does not occur in the works of Celsus. For the Arabians, see\r\nSerapion (c. 155); Avicenna (ii, 2, 32.) They all copy from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. Even Ebn Baithar supplies nothing of much consequence. (i, 90.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈνάγυρος,\r\n\r\nAnagyrus, _Stinking-bean Trefoil_; is a strong-scented and acrid shrub\r\nof hot and discutient powers, but the seed consists of more subtile\r\nparticles, and is emetic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and Pliny recommend the _Anagyris fœtida_ for\r\npromoting the pains of labour, and the expulsion of the placenta after\r\ndelivery. It is curious to remark that our old herbalists ascribe the\r\nsame virtues to it. It was therefore to our forefathers in the profession\r\nwhat the ergot of rye is to the present generation; being, according to\r\nGalen, an acrid, diaphoretic, and heating substance, its action must, in\r\nmany respects, have resembled the ergot. With the exception of Oribasius,\r\nwho merely copies Dioscorides, we are not aware of any ancient writer\r\nthat treats of it, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, and he also merely\r\ncopies the descriptions of it given by Dioscorides and Galen. Though\r\nexcluded from our Dispensatory, this article is not wholly unknown to the\r\nshops. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 93.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈνδράχνη,\r\n\r\nPortulaca, _Purslain_, is cooling in the third degree, but humectates\r\nin the second; and by these powers it relieves heat of the stomach when\r\napplied to the abdomen, and dispels defluxions. By its viscidity it\r\nsmooths the teeth when set on edge by acids; and by its astringency it\r\nrelieves dysentery and hemorrhages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aëtius, like our author, describes the purslane (_Portulaca\r\noleracea_) as a cooling and sub-astringent herb. Both he and our author\r\ncopy from Galen, who writes earnestly in commendation of this plant,\r\nwhich retained its place in our English Dispensatories down to a late\r\ndate. Dioscorides likewise writes fully on its virtues, recommending it\r\nas a cooling and astringent medicine, externally, in pains of the head,\r\ninflammations of the eyes &c., and internally, for inflammations of the\r\nbowels, intestinal worms, hæmoptysis, hemorrhoids, and various other\r\ncases. (ii, 150.) Celsus also calls it an astringent and cooling herb.\r\n(ii.) For the Arabians, see Serapion (c. 349); Avicenna (ii, 2, 534);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 563); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) They treat of\r\nit in nearly the same terms as the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈνδρόσαιμον,\r\n\r\nAndrosæmum, _Tutsan_, or _Park-leaves_, (or St. John’s wort?); there are\r\ntwo varieties of it, the one of which is called ascyrron and ascyrroides,\r\nbeing a species of hypericon, but the other is named dionysias. Their\r\nfruit is purgative, but their leaves more desiccant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our Tutsan or Park-leaves has been generally set down as this\r\nplant, but Sibthorp, who viewed the plants of classic lands on the spot,\r\ninclines to the _Hypericum ciliatum_. The truth of the matter we believe\r\nto be that as the _Hypericum_ is a numerous genus, and the species have\r\na close resemblance to one another, they were often confounded together\r\nby the older authorities. Both Culpeper the herbalist and Rutty have\r\nexpressed their wonder that so important an article as the _androsæmum_\r\nshould have been lost sight of in recent times. Pliny, and all the\r\nmedical authorities, recommend it strongly as an application to burns\r\nand ulcers, and ascribe cholagogue powers to it when administered\r\ninternally. See Dioscorides (iii, 163); Galen (De Simpl. v); Aëtius (i);\r\nOribasius (Med. Coll. xiii); Ebn Baithar (ii, 579); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 59.) The last two merely give extracts from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈνδρόσακες,\r\n\r\nAndrosaces, is a bitter and acrid herb, discutient and desiccative. It\r\nand its fruit, when drunk, are diuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is a Syrian plant, which, although both Matthiolus and\r\nGerarde pretend to give figures of it, has never been satisfactorily\r\ndetermined. Serapion and Avicenna have completely omitted treating of it,\r\nand Rhases merely says of the _androsafes_, by which he probably meant\r\nthe _androsaces_, that it is decidedly heating with moderate astringency.\r\n(Cont. l. ult.) Our author seems to copy from Dioscorides (iii, 140.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈνεμώνη,\r\n\r\nAnemone, _Wind-flower_; all the varieties of it have powers which are\r\nacrid, detergent, epispastic, and open the mouths of vessels: whence they\r\nincrease phlegm, remove leprosy when applied, and attract milk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The wind-flowers, so celebrated in ancient poetry, being a\r\nnumerous genus, there has been some difficulty in determining exactly\r\nthe species described by Dioscorides. He mentions two, the cultivated\r\nand the wild, and divides each into two varieties, according to the\r\ndifference of colour in their flowers. The former may be set down as\r\nthe _A. coronaria_, and the other as the _A. nemorosa_. The latter only\r\nis indigenous in this country, but the other is commonly cultivated\r\nin gardens. He recommends them principally as external applications,\r\nas for foul ulcers, in collyria for inflammation of the eyes, and in\r\npessaries to promote menstruation. (ii, 207.) Galen and the succeeding\r\nauthorities follow him. The anemone is not to be found in Celsus. For the\r\nArabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 655); Serapion (c. 72); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. iii, 48); Ebn Baithar (ii, 100.) They do little more than copy from\r\nDioscorides. The _A. pratensis_ occurs in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\n(132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌνηθον,\r\n\r\nAnethum, _Dill_; it warms in the second degree intensely, and dries in\r\nnearly the same degree. When boiled in oil it is diaphoretic, anodyne,\r\nand soporific; and concocts crude swellings. But when burnt it becomes\r\nof the third order of heating and drying medicines, and is useful when\r\nsprinkled upon foul ulcers. But the green is more humid, and less hot and\r\ndigestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author condenses and abridges the account of the dill\r\n(_Anethum graveolens_) given by Galen. Dioscorides, in his usual\r\nempirical style, recommends it for various purposes, such as promoting\r\nthe flow of milk, stopping slight vomiting, opening the bowels,\r\nincreasing the urine, proving useful to hysterical women in a hip-bath,\r\nand so forth. (iii, 60.) The Arabians as usual copy from both. See\r\nAvicenna. (ii, 2, 69.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌνθυλλις,\r\n\r\nAnthyllis; there are two varieties, both of which are desiccant\r\napplications to ulcers; but that resembling the ground-pine consists of\r\nmore subtile particles, so as to be beneficial in epileptic cases. It is\r\nalso more detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The former species, which Dioscorides describes and\r\nrecommends for the cure of wounds, we would willingly refer to the\r\n_Anthyllis vulneraria_, but the predominance of authority is against it,\r\nand in favour of the _Cressa cretica_. The other is probably the _Ajuga\r\nIva_. Avicenna joins Dioscorides in commending it as a vulnerary herb\r\n(ii, 2, 744), for which virtue the anthyllis was long celebrated, as its\r\nscientific name implies.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌνησον,\r\n\r\nAnisum, _Anise_; the seed is particularly acrid, eating, and drying in\r\nthe third degree. Hence it is diuretic and dispels flatus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Serapion and Avicenna, like the Greek authorities, call the\r\n_Pimpinella anisum_ diuretic and emmenagogue. It is now reckoned the\r\nfirst of the four hot seeds, the other three being carui, cumin, and\r\nfennel.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈντίρρινον or Ἀνάρρινον,\r\n\r\nAntirrinon, or Anarrinon, _Snapdragon_, has properties resembling those\r\nof the bubonium, but weaker, whence you may learn its properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen writes of this article, _Antirrinum Orontium_, or\r\nCalfsnout, as being of no use in medicine. (De Simpl. v.) Dioscorides,\r\nalso, mentions it only as an amulet and external application. (iv, 131.)\r\nIt is scarcely noticed by the other authorities. According to Pliny, it\r\nis emmenagogue. Serapion has omitted it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌνωνις or Ὤνωνις,\r\n\r\nAnonis, or Ononis, _Rest-harrow_, has heating powers, especially in its\r\nroot. Its juice, when drunk with wine, promotes the secretion of urine,\r\nis lithontriptic, breaks eschars, and soothes pains of the teeth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author abridges his account of the _Ononis antiquorum_\r\nfrom Galen. All in fact borrow from Dioscorides, who further mentions of\r\nit, that it was sometimes used as a pickle. (iii, 18.) It would appear\r\nto be the _Onobes_ of Rhases (Cont. i, 520), who gives the characters of\r\nit from Galen. Serapion and Avicenna have omitted it. Modern authorities\r\nenumerate it among the five aperient roots. It is only of late years that\r\nit has been expelled from our Pharmacopœias. Even yet it is not wholly\r\nunknown to our apothecaries. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p. 94.) Two\r\nspecies of the _Anonis_, the _antiquorum_ and _spinosa_, occur in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia (p. 119.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈπαρίνη,\r\n\r\nLappa, _Cleavers_ (which some call philanthropon, others omphalocarpon),\r\nis moderately detergent and desiccative; it also consists of subtile\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the herbalists and best commentators agree that it is\r\nthe _Galium aparine_. (See Gerarde, Sprengel, and others.) According to\r\nDioscorides a decoction of its leaves is useful to persons bitten by\r\nphalangia and vipers, when drunk with wine; an injection of the same\r\ninto the ears cures earache; and when mixed up with axunge it discusses\r\nscrofulous tumours. Galen and the subsequent authorities seem to\r\nattach less importance to it. (iii, 94.) We cannot find it in Serapion,\r\nRhases, Avicenna, nor Haly Abbas; but it is treated of by all our older\r\nherbalists, and has found a place in many modern pharmacopœias. It is not\r\ncontained, however, in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌπιον,\r\n\r\nPyrum, _the Pear_, is unequal as to temperament, consisting partly\r\nof terrene and partly of watery matter. When eaten, therefore, it is\r\nstomachic, and quenches thirst. When applied as a cataplasm it dries and\r\ncools moderately.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author copies the characters of the _Pyrus communis_ from\r\nGalen and Aëtius. We have treated of it as an article of food in the\r\nFirst Book. Both Dioscorides and Pliny make mention of perry. Dioscorides\r\nsays, that pears prove prejudicial to hungry persons when eaten. (i, 167.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈπόκυνον or Κυνοκράμβη,\r\n\r\nBrassica canina, _Dog’s-bane_; it is also called cynomoron, because\r\nit proves quickly fatal to dogs. But it is also deleterious to men,\r\nbeing very fetid and hot, without being desiccant. Hence, when applied\r\nexternally as a cataplasm it is discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author borrows his account of this article very closely\r\nfrom Galen. It is clearly a poison rather than a medicine. In fact, it is\r\nclassed by Schulze among the ancient poisons. (Toxicol. veterum.) Orfila\r\nalso treats of it among the acrid poisons (p. 82, Eng. ed.) It seems\r\ndoubtful whether it be the _Periploca Græca_, as we formerly stated it to\r\nbe (II, 242); the _Cynanchus erectus_, as Sprengel supposes; or one of\r\nthe species of _Apocynum_. Having no practical acquaintance with these\r\nherbs, we cannot pretend to give any decided opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈπόχυμα,\r\n\r\nApochyma, is the old pitch scraped from ships. It is solvent, desiccant,\r\nand discutient of tumours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides calls it also Ζωπίσσα. It consists, as he\r\nexplains, of the wax and pitch of ships which had been macerated in salt\r\nwater. Pliny says of it, “Zopissam eradi navibus diximus cera marino sale\r\nmaceratâ. Optima hæc a tirocinio navium. Additur autem in malagmata ad\r\ndiscutiendas collectiones.” (H. N. xxiv, 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈράχνη,\r\n\r\n_Aranea_, _the Spider_, when softened into a plaster, and applied to the\r\nforehead and temples, is said by Dioscorides to remove the periodical\r\nattacks of tertians. Its web, when applied, stops hemorrhage, and\r\npreserves superficial sores from inflammation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two species, which probably are the\r\n_Aranea retiaria_, and the _Aranea domestica_. Serapion gives the\r\nsame account of their medicinal properties. They appear to have been\r\nprincipally used externally, as an anti-inflammatory application.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈργεμώνη,\r\n\r\nArgemone, _Prickly Poppy_, is possessed of detergent and discutient\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Of the two species described by Dioscorides, the former,\r\nwhich is the _Papaver argemone_, is recommended by him in nebulæ\r\nand albugo of the eye, and its leaves as a soothing cataplasm for\r\ninflammations. The other, which may be the _Geum urbanum_, or avens,\r\nhe also recommends principally as an external application in sores and\r\naffections of the eyes; but adds of it, that when drunk with wine it\r\nis useful in the case of persons stung by venomous animals. (ii, 208.)\r\nGalen and the succeeding authorities treat of it more cursorily; and the\r\nArabians would seem not to treat of it at all, with the exception of Ebn\r\nBaithar, who merely gives translations of what Dioscorides and Galen had\r\nwritten of it. (i, 28.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρίσαρον,\r\n\r\nArisarum, _Friar’s Cowl_, is smaller than the wakerobin, but much more\r\nacrid; and has a root of the size of an olive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our herbalists give the name of Friar’s Cowl to this plant,\r\nwhich even they admit to be possessed of insignificant powers. It is the\r\naris of Pliny. (H. N. xxiv, 16.) Its botanical name is _Arum arisaron_.\r\nDioscorides calls it an acrid medicine, and recommends it solely in\r\ncollyria. (ii, 198.) The Arabians appear to have confounded it with the\r\narum, under the name of Luf. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 132); and Ebn Baithar\r\n(ii, 449.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈριστολοχία,\r\n\r\nAristolochia, _Birthwort_; all kinds of it are hot, consist of subtile\r\nparticles, and are detergent, bitter and subacrid; and are most useful\r\nremedies. The round consists of more subtile particles, and is every\r\nway more drastic. The clematitis is fragrant but weaker. The long is,\r\nin other respects, intermediate between these, but no less hot than the\r\nround.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Three species of the Birthwort, the _Aristolochia longa_,\r\n_rotunda_, and _clematis_, have been described by the authorities from\r\nDioscorides downwards. The first two still retain their places in\r\nour Pharmacopœias, but are seldom used. Dioscorides recommends them,\r\nespecially as uterine medicines, for promoting menstruation, the lochial\r\ndischarge, and the expulsion of the fœtus. He also says it is useful in\r\naffections of the chest, the spleen, and in other diseases. (iii, 4, 5.)\r\nThe toxicologists from Nicander downwards recommend the birthwort as\r\nan antidote to poisons. See also Theophr. (H. P. ix, 15); and Apuleius\r\n(De Herbis.) Mesue describes it as being phlegmagogue, cholagogue, and\r\nemmenagogue. He also recommends it in a fumigation along with arsenic\r\nfor asthma. (De Simpl. ii, 27.) Avicenna treats of it at great length,\r\nrecommending it strongly as an uterine and alexipharmic medicine. (ii,\r\n2, 49.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 77); Averrhoes (Collig. v,\r\n42); Serapion (c. 171); Ebn Baithar, _pluries_. Pliny describes a fourth\r\nspecies under the name of Pistolochia. Modern authorities confirm the\r\nbirthwort’s character as to its being powerfully emmenagogue. See Quincy,\r\nLewis, Pereira, and the other writers on the Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌρκευθος,\r\n\r\nJuniperus, _the Juniper_, heats and dries in the third degree. The fruit\r\nis equally calefacient, but desiccant only in the first degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two species of it, the major and the\r\nminor, which probably are to be referred to the _Juniperus macrocarpa_,\r\nSibth., and the _J. oxycedrus_. He calls them acrid, diuretic, and\r\ncalefacient, and further recommends them in diseases of the chest, in the\r\nhysterical convulsion, and as being alexipharmic. (i, 103.) The other\r\nauthorities, both Greek and Arabian, copy closely under this head from\r\nhim. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 359); and Ebn Baithar (ii, 189.)\r\nThe vernix is a resinous gum, which is procured from the juniper; it is\r\ncalled _Sandarax_ by the Arabians, and is to be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom the sandaracha or sulphuret of arsenic. They recommend it in\r\nhæmoptysis. See Serapion, Rhases, and Avicenna. Of the juniper, see\r\nfurther under Κέδρος, and appendix under Sandaracha.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌρκιον,\r\n\r\nArcium (called also Prosopites); its leaves are like those of the\r\ncolocynth, but larger and harder. It is discutient and desiccant, and has\r\nsome stypticity. Wherefore, its leaves cure old sores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient descriptions of this plant seem to point to the\r\nburdock, which, however, owing to a confusion of names, has been called\r\nthe _Arctium lappa_. Dioscorides recommends it internally in diseases\r\nof the chest, and externally as a cataplasm to old ulcers. (iv, 105.)\r\nThis is the same as the second arctium of Galen, who recommends it in\r\nthe same cases as Dioscorides. Apuleius, like Dioscorides, says it is\r\nuseful in cases of strangury. Our old herbalists treat of the virtues of\r\nthe burdock in the same terms as the Greek and Roman authorities. The\r\nArabians, as far as we can discover, do not treat either of the arcion or\r\nthe arction, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely gives extracts\r\nfrom Dioscorides and Galen, and seems puzzled to distinguish the two\r\nplants from one another. (i, 25.) In the modern Greek Dispensatory both\r\nthe _Arctium bardana_ and the _A. lappa_ are set down as corresponding to\r\nthe ἄρκειον.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌρκτιον,\r\n\r\nArctium, _Lappa_, is like the verbascum; its roots are tender, white, and\r\nsweet: it consists of subtile particles, and is possessed of desiccant\r\nand moderately detergent powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This, which is treated of under the same name by Dioscorides\r\n(iii, 104), and is the former arctium of Galen, is probably the\r\n_Verbascum sanguineum_. The description of it given by Galen, at all\r\nevents, points to some species of the mullein. Both the authorities we\r\nhave mentioned recommend it as an application to burns and chilblains.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρμενιακὸν,\r\n\r\nArmeniacum, has detergent properties with a little acrimony, and a\r\nsmall degree of astringency. It is therefore mixed up with ophthalmic\r\nmedicines, and promotes the growth of the hairs of the eyelids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall not enter into the discussion of disputed points\r\nrespecting this article, further than to state our own opinion, that in\r\nall probability it was a native ore of carbonate of copper; but which of\r\nthe species or sub-species described by modern mineralists the armenium\r\nwas, we cannot venture to decide. See Cleavland’s Mineralogy (p. 570,\r\n&c.) Dioscorides, who treats of it under the name of armenium, (v, 105),\r\ncompares it to chrysocolla, which it is well ascertained is that species\r\nof native carbonate of copper now described under the names of copper\r\ngreen and mountain green. He merely recommends it as a cosmetic when\r\napplied to the eyelashes. Serapion confounds this substance with the\r\nLapis armeniacus, (c. 404); but Avicenna accurately distinguishes between\r\nthem. (ii, 2, 56, 415.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρνάβω,\r\n\r\nArnabo, is one of the aromatics. Hence it is mostly mixed up with\r\nointments, being possessed of hot and dry powers in the third degree,\r\nlike cassia and carpesium. Hence Posidonius says, that it may be used\r\ninstead of cinnamon when it is not at hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article, which is treated of only by Aëtius (xvi, 113),\r\nbesides our author, has never been accurately determined. It has been\r\nsupposed to be the zerumbeth, of which we will have occasion to treat\r\nmore fully in another place. See the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρνόχλωσσον,\r\n\r\nPlantago, _Plantain_, both cools and dries in the second degree, being\r\ncomposed of a watery and a terrene substance, and having a little\r\nastringency; therefore it agrees with malignant ulcers, defluxions, and\r\nmortifications; by the symmetry of its temperament it stops hemorrhages,\r\nand agrees with most of them. For it is desiccant without being\r\nstimulant, and cooling without being narcotic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The greater plantain of Dioscorides was probably the\r\n_Plantago major_, which, in all ages down to the present times, has\r\nbeen so celebrated as a vulnerary herb. Our author’s account of its\r\nvirtues is taken either from Dioscorides or Galen, for, in the present\r\ninstance, there is scarcely a shade of difference in opinion between\r\nthese two authorities. The lesser plantain of Dioscorides is either the\r\n_lanceolata_ or _maritima_, probably the former. (ii, 152.) See Macer\r\nFloridus. Avicenna and Serapion copy word for word from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. None of the plantains are mentioned by Hippocrates. Celsus places\r\nthe “plantago” in the list of substances which are both astringent and\r\ncooling. (ii, 33.) None of the species of plantago here described occur\r\nin the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌρον,\r\n\r\nArum, _Wakerobin_, is of the first order in heating and drying, being\r\nformed of a terrene substance that is hot and detergent. Its roots are\r\nhotter. But the dracunculus is stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have all along assumed, with our older herbalists, that\r\nthis is the wakerobin or cuckow-pent, namely, the _Arum maculatum_\r\nL. Pliny and Mesue are the only ancient authors who have noticed its\r\npurgative powers. Our author’s account of its faculties is much the same\r\nas that given by Dioscorides, Galen, and Oribasius, and its ancient\r\ncharacter has been amply confirmed by modern authority. The Arabians\r\ntreat of it fully, but rather confusedly, under the name of _Luf_. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 432); Serapion (c. 43); Ebn Baithar (ii, 246.) Even at\r\nthe present day it is not wholly excluded from the Materia Medica. See\r\nPereira (M. M. p. 811.) We have treated of its congener, the dragon herb,\r\nas an article of food, in another place. See Book I, 114.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρσενίκον,\r\n\r\n_Arsenic_, is possessed of caustic powers. It is used also for\r\ndepilatories, but if the application be allowed to remain long it\r\naffects the skin itself. When burnt its particles become attenuated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no hesitation in deciding that this is the\r\nyellow sulphuret of arsenic, commonly called orpiment, the latter\r\nterm being a corruption of auripigmentum, the Latin name of it. See\r\nCelsus (v, 5.) The ancients used this mineral very freely as an\r\nexternal application, and internally by the mouth, in clysters, and\r\nin fumigations. Avicenna recommends arsenic with the gum of pine, in\r\nthe form of a pill, for asthma. He also speaks highly of a potion\r\ncontaining arsenic and honeyed water. He particularly commends arsenic\r\nas an application to herpes esthiomenos of the nose. (ii, 2, 48.) Cælius\r\nAurelianus recommends an injection containing arsenic for ascarides.\r\n(Tard. Pass. iv, 7). It was freely used in injections for the cure of\r\nchronic dysentery. (See Book iii.) Serapion speaks favorably of it in\r\ncomplaints of the eyes. (§ 381.) Servitor says, that sublimed arsenic is\r\na septic and pungent medicine, which removes the fungous flesh of ulcers,\r\nand is a depilatory. He describes minutely the process of subliming and\r\nwhitening it. Avicenna likewise makes mention of white arsenic. Geber\r\nalso treats of sublimed arsenic, by which it is clear he meant the\r\nfactitious oxide with which we are now familiar. (iii, 29.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈρτεμισία,\r\n\r\nArtemisia, _Mugwort_; both varieties are heating in the second degree,\r\nand desiccant in the first. They are composed of subtile particles, so\r\nthat they break down stones in the kidneys, and suit with fumigations of\r\nthe womb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The three species of the artemisia described by Dioscorides\r\nare probably the _arborescens_, _spicata_, and _campestris_. He\r\nrecommends the artemisia strongly as an emmenagogue, when given\r\ninternally, in the form of a hip-bath, and as an injection into the\r\nvagina. He also makes it to be lithontriptic. (iii, 107, 118.) The same\r\ncharacters are given it by Galen and by Avicenna, whose _berengfef_ it\r\nappears to be. (c. 83.) Aëtius and most of the authorities describe only\r\nthe first two species of the artemisia. Serapion and Avicenna describe\r\nunder this head an oriental species, which, it is probable, was the\r\n_Artemisia Judaica_. Honain (ap. Avicennam), also describes the _A.\r\nIndica_. The famous _Moxa_ is prepared from the lanugo or downy substance\r\nwhich adheres to the under surface of the leaf of the artemisia. See\r\nBarrow’s ‘Travels in China,’ Woodville, Miller, and Pereira. That the\r\nartemisia long retained the character which Dioscorides gave it, of\r\npossessing powerful virtues as an emmenagogue and a lithontriptic, is\r\nevident from what is said of it in the work of Macer Floridus. Except as\r\nfurnishing the moxa, (and it is now believed to be got from a particular\r\nspecies, the _A. moxa_) the species of artemisia here treated of are now\r\nwholly discarded from the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nἍρτος,\r\n\r\nPanis, _Bread_; in a cataplasm it is more discutient than can be\r\naccounted for from the properties of wheat, owing to its containing salt\r\nand leaven. For the leaven is attractive of the deep-seated humours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have given some account of the kinds of bread used by\r\nthe ancients in the 78th sect. of the First Book. Oribasius gives an\r\nexcellent description of the mode of preparing the bread poultice and\r\nits uses. He directs us to dissolve the bread in water until it acquires\r\nthe consistence of gruel, and then, having added oil or butter to it,\r\nto boil it to the proper consistence. He adds, that it is the best of\r\nall applications with which he was acquainted for promoting suppuration.\r\nHis account of the different kinds of cataplasms is most ample and\r\ninteresting. (Med. Collect.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌσαρον,\r\n\r\nAsarum, _Asarabacca_, has the same powers as the sweet flag, but more\r\nintense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This plant, which is certainly the _Asarum Europæum_, or\r\ncommon Asarabacca, is said by Dioscorides to be diuretic, heating, and\r\nemetic, answering well with dropsical cases and chronic sciatica and\r\npromoting menstruation; its roots drunk with mulse to the amount of\r\nsix drachms, he says, purge like white hellebore. (i, 9.) Galen seems\r\nto have overlooked the importance of this article, for he is nearly as\r\nbrief as our author in treating of it; and Aëtius and Oribasius follow\r\nhim. Serapion, Rhases, and Avicenna recommend it in the same cases\r\nas Dioscorides, and also in obstructions of the liver and spleen, and\r\nas a stimulant ingredient in collyria. Modern authorities confirm the\r\ncharacter of this medicinal article given it by Dioscorides. See Lewis\r\n(Mat. Med. i, 178); Rutty (Mat. Med. 43); Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p.\r\n38.) Although not excluded from our Dispensatories, less attention is now\r\nbestowed on the asarabacca than it would seem to deserve. See Royle (M.\r\nM. p. 548.) Ipecacuanha has nearly superseded it as an emetic in this\r\ncountry. The asarum is still retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\n(p. 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσβόλη,\r\n\r\nFuligo, _the Soot_ which painters use. It is taken from glassworks, and\r\nis possessed of discutient and acrid powers, so as to burn and occasion\r\nputrefaction. It cures burns, with rose-cerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and some of the other authorities mention the\r\n_Fuligo_, or _soot_ of glassworks, in nearly the same terms as Paulus.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσκαλαβώτης,\r\n\r\nStellio, _the Swift_; this animal is useless for all other purposes, but\r\nthey say that it is a good application to persons bitten by a scorpion.\r\nIt is mixed also with venereal excitants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of this reptile in the Fifth Book. It is the\r\nspotted lizard, _Lacerta stellio_ L. Its aphrodisiacal faculty is alluded\r\nto by our author in another place. (B. III, 58.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσκληπιάς,\r\n\r\nAsclepias, _Swallow-wort_, being hot and dry as to its powers, and\r\nconsisting of subtile particles, agrees well with tormina when drunk with\r\nwine, and in the form of a cataplasm it is a good application to the\r\nbites of venomous animals, and malignant ulcers in the uterus and breasts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There appears little reason to doubt that it is the\r\n_Asclepias vincetoxicum_, or Swallow-wort. Our author borrows its\r\nmedicinal characters from Dioscorides. (iii, 96.) Galen candidly admits,\r\nthat he had no experience of it as a medicine. Pliny, like Dioscorides\r\nand our author, recommends it for the cure of tormina and the bites of\r\nserpents. (H. N. xxvii, 18.) Until lately it held a place in our modern\r\nDispensatories, with the characters given it by the ancients. See Quincy\r\n(p. 59); Rutty (Mat. Med. p. 44); Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p. 57.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἌσκυρρον is treated of under Androsæmon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have stated under ἀνδρόσαιμον the difficulty there is in\r\ndistinguishing the different species of _Hypericum_ described by the\r\nancients. We cannot pretend to decide whether the present article be the\r\n_androsæmum_ or the _perforatum_. Dioscorides recommends the ascyrron\r\nas an emmenagogue, in sciatica, and as an application to burns. (iii,\r\n163.) The Arabians treat of it only as being identical either with the\r\nhypericum or the androsæmum. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 59); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2. 354.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσπάλαθος,\r\n\r\nAspalathus, _Rose-wood_, is composed of heterogeneous ingredients, having\r\nacrid and astringent powers, and hence it is desiccant. On this account\r\nit is useful for mortifications and defluxions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We must not enter into the discussion regarding this article;\r\nsuffice to say, that we have now arrived at the conclusion that it was\r\neither the _Lignum rhodium_, or a substance so near to it in qualities,\r\nthat the latter came to be substituted for it. We need scarcely say, that\r\nthere is great difference of opinion among the botanical authorities what\r\ntree or shrub it is which produces the _Lignum rhodium_. Upon the whole\r\nthe predominence of evidence is in favour of some species of _Cytisus_.\r\nDioscorides recommends the aspalathus when boiled in wine as a gargle in\r\naphthæ, as an injection in spreading and impure ulcers of the genital\r\norgans (_chancres?_), in dysuria, flatulence, and other complaints. (i,\r\n19.) Now it will be observed that the distilled oil of _Lignum rhodium_\r\nhas been recommended in similar cases by modern authorities. See Moses\r\nCharras (Royal Pharmacopœia, Chemical, iii, 1, 24.) The Arabians give the\r\naspalathus the same characters as the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 206);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 251.) The aspalathus of Celsus (v, 24) was, no\r\ndoubt, the same as that of Dioscorides. It is probably the μέλαινα ῥίζα\r\nof Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσπάραγος,\r\n\r\nAsparagus, _the Rock Asparagus_, or _Myacanthinus_, is detergent, but\r\nof a middle temperament as to heat and cold; it is deobstruent of the\r\nkidneys and liver, especially its roots and seed. It also cures toothache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Book I, 75. The medicinal asparagus of the ancients\r\nwould appear to have been different from our garden asparagus, from the\r\ndescription of its root given by Dioscorides (ii, 151), and yet there\r\nseems to have been very little difference between them in properties,\r\nsince both are used for the same culinary and medicinal purposes;\r\nthe ancient, we suppose, must have been the _A. acutifolius_. From\r\nDioscorides down to the present time, the asparagus has been celebrated\r\nas being possessed of deobstruent and diuretic powers, and hence it has\r\nbeen given in jaundice, nephritis, and many other diseases of a like\r\nkind. Celsus recommends it as a pickle in affections of the spleen. (iv,\r\n9.) It occurs in the Hippocratic collection, and is fully treated of by\r\nthe Arabians. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 603); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 667.)\r\nSymeon Seth, after repeating from Galen that the asparagus acts upon the\r\nkidneys and imparts its odour to it, remarks that this need not surprise\r\nus, since, by holding a certain herb of a red colour in the hands, the\r\nurine is reddened. What herb he alludes to cannot be exactly ascertained.\r\n(V. Not. Bogdani.) At all events it is clear from this that the ancients\r\nbelieved in absorption by the cuticle. The Arabians held that it is\r\nantiseptic. Casiri (Bibl. Hist. Arab. 337.) The wild asparagus was called\r\n_Corruda_ (Cato de R. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσπλήνιον,\r\n\r\nAsplenium, _Spleenwort_, or _Ceterach_, has the properties of a substance\r\nwhich consists of subtile particles, but is not hot. It therefore breaks\r\ndown stones and dissolves indurated spleens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The spleenwort, or _Asplenium ceterach_, held a place in the\r\nMateria Medica from the earliest times down to a very recent period.\r\nDioscorides commends it in diseases of the spleen (whence it derives its\r\nname), in strangury, jaundice, and calculus. Galen briefly assigns it the\r\nsame character, which is repeated by Aëtius and Oribasius, as well as by\r\nour author, and also by Avicenna (630.) We cannot find it mentioned by\r\nSerapion or Rhases. It held a place in our Dispensatory in the time of\r\nLewis. (Materia Medica A.D. 1791.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσταφὶς,\r\n\r\nUva passa, _the Raisin_; the cultivated is possessed of digestive,\r\nastringent, and slightly discutient powers; the wild is possessed of\r\nstrongly acrid, so as to be strongly phlegmagogue and detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides treats much more fully of the medicinal powers\r\nof raisins than Galen and our author, recommending them in affections\r\nof the windpipe, chest, kidneys, and bladder; for dysentery when eaten\r\nwith their stones by themselves, or when fried along with millet flour,\r\nbarley-meal, and eggs; in masticatories with pepper; in inflammation\r\nof the testicles, when applied in a cataplasm with the flour of beans\r\nand cumin; for epinyctis, carbuncle, fevers, putrid and gangrenous\r\nsores about the joints, without their stones, when pounded with rue;\r\nfor gout in a cataplasm with opoponax, and for the removal of loose\r\nnails. (v, 4.) Avicenna and Rhases briefly quote Dioscorides, and supply\r\nnothing additional. They hold, like the Greeks, that in particular cases\r\nraisins prove injurious to the urinary organs. Symeon Seth mentions that\r\nthe Egyptians prepared a very sweet wine from raisins and honey. (De\r\nAlimentis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈστὴρ Ἀττικὸς,\r\n\r\nAster atticus, _Starwort_, is also called bubonium, because it is\r\nbelieved to cure buboes, not only when applied for this purpose but\r\neven when appended as a periapt. It is possessed of mixed powers, being\r\ndiscutient and cooling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the starwort, _Aster amyllus_,\r\nis taken from Galen, who in his turn copies from Dioscorides. In the\r\ncommon editions of Dioscorides there is a passage under this head (which\r\nalthough quoted by Serapion (§ 96), is scarcely considered genuine by\r\nSprengel, seeing it is not alluded to by Galen or Pliny), in which the\r\n_Aster atticus_ is recommended for ardour of the stomach, inflammations\r\nof the eyes, buboes, and quinsies. The Arabians in treating of the _Aster\r\natticus_ copy from Dioscorides. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 357);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 96); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 95.) It is not found\r\nin the works of Celsus. It held a place in our modern Dispensatory down\r\nto a late date. See Quincy (116.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈστράγαλος,\r\n\r\nAstragalus, _Wild Liquorice_, is a small shrub, having astringent\r\nroots, and is desiccative in no contemptible degree. It promotes\r\nthe cicatrization of old ulcers, and when drunk with wine stops the\r\ndischarges of the bowels. It is mostly produced in Phæneum of Arcadia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the astragalus belongs to the vetch tribe can admit\r\nof no doubt, but the particular genus and species have never been\r\ndetermined. All the authorities, both ancient and modern, recommend it as\r\nan astringent both externally and internally. We cannot find it in the\r\nworks either of Hippocrates or Celsus. Our author manifestly borrows from\r\nDioscorides. (iv, 62.) The Arabians do not appear to treat of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἌσφαλτος,\r\n\r\nBitumen; it is desiccant and calefacient in the second degree: it is\r\ntherefore agglutinative of fresh wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The asphaltus, or _Bitumen judaicum_, held a place in the\r\nMateria Medica from the days of Hippocrates down to a very recent period.\r\nIt got the name of Jew’s pitch, from its having been principally procured\r\nfrom Judæa, where it is found floating on the surface of the Dead Sea,\r\nor Lacus Asphaltites. Some commentators have been puzzled by Dioscorides\r\nrepresenting the colour of the finest asphaltus as purplish, but it is\r\nto be borne in mind that the ancients applied this term not to a scarlet\r\nred but to any rich dark-blue colour, such as that of the sea. All\r\nthe authorities, ancient and modern, represent it as being emollient,\r\ndiscutient, and emmenagogue. Serapion gives a very interesting account\r\nof it. (§ 177.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 114); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n88); also Celsus (v, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈσφόδελος,\r\n\r\nAsphodelus, _Kingspear_; its root is possessed of detergent and\r\ndiscutient powers. When burnt its ashes become more calefacient,\r\ndesiccative, and attenuate. It therefore cures alopecia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the ancient authorities, including Hippocrates and\r\nCelsus, treat of the _Aspodelus ramosus_, or Kingspear, and in general\r\nare agreed in recommending it internally as being emmenagogue and\r\ndiuretic, and externally as an application to alopecia or _porrigo\r\ndecalvans_. The author who treats of it most elaborately is Dioscorides,\r\nwho recommends it for the purposes we have mentioned, and as an\r\nalexipharmic, as a cure for toothache, and many other cases. (ii, 199.)\r\nOur author follows Galen. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 273);\r\nSerapion (c. 221); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 26.) They all copy from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. It was sometimes used as a culinary herb. See\r\nVol. I, p. 118. Our old herbalists repeat its ancient characters as a\r\nmedicine. See Gerard (i, 70.) It has been discarded from the Pharmacopœia\r\nfor some time past.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈτρακτυλὶς,\r\n\r\nAtractylis, _Wild Cnicus_, or _Distaff-thistle_; it is of the thorny\r\ntribe, being possessed of desiccative and moderately heating powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In another place (Vol. I, p. 113) we have treated of the\r\natractylis as a culinary herb, agreeing with Sprengel in referring it\r\nto the _Carlina lanata_. The commentators on Dioscorides, however, are\r\ngreatly at variance with regard to it; most of the old herbalists agree\r\nwith Belon and Fuchsius in holding it to be the _Carduus benedictus_, or\r\nblessed thistle. See Gerard’s Herbal (ii, 489.) We cannot help remarking,\r\nhowever, that the virtues of the _Carduus benedictus_ as given by Quincy\r\n(English Dispensatory, i, 2) by no means agree with those assigned to\r\nthe atractylis by Dioscorides; he holds it to be alexipharmical. (iii,\r\n97.) Our author copies from Galen. The Arabians supply no additional\r\ninformation. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 159.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἈτράφαξις,\r\n\r\nAtriplex, _Orache_, moistens in the second degree and cools in the\r\nfirst. It therefore opens the belly. Its fruit is possessed of detergent\r\npowers, whence it is useful in jaundice and obstructions of the liver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the orach (_Atriplex Hortensis_) as a\r\nculinary herb in Book I, § 74. It is still used as an article of food\r\non the Continent. Our author copies from Dioscorides (ii, 145), whose\r\naccount of it is amplified and explained by Galen. (De Simpl. v.) It\r\nis briefly treated of in like terms by Avicenna (ii, 2, 174); Serapion\r\n(c. 146); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 97.) Rhases, after quoting what\r\nDioscorides and Paulus say of it, adds on his own authority that he had\r\nknown the seed of it prove powerfully emetic and laxative.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈφάκη,\r\n\r\nAphace, _Wild Vetch_, is possessed of astringent powers like the lentil;\r\nbut when eaten it is more difficult to digest than the lentil, and is\r\nmore strongly desiccative, with a moderate degree of heating properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is clearly a species of _Vicia_, but whether the\r\n_bithynica_, _lutea_, or _hybrida_ cannot be satisfactorily determined.\r\nIt is treated of by our older herbalists, who agree with the ancients in\r\nassigning to it astringent powers. The Arabian authorities would appear\r\nto have overlooked it. Our author is indebted to Dioscorides (ii, 177)\r\nand Galen (De Simpl. v.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΑφρόνιτρον,\r\n\r\nAphronitrum is possessed of discutient and detergent powers, so as not\r\nonly to cleanse those parts which are foul, but also to cure pruritus.\r\nBut when drunk it is bad for the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈφρὸς νίτρου,\r\n\r\nSpuma nitri; it has powers like those of natron, but its substance is\r\nmore attenuate, and therefore it is smooth like flour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. As Dr. Coray’s account of the _Nitrum_, _Aphronitrum_, and\r\n_Spuma nitri_ of the ancients is of high authority, we are induced to\r\ngive it in his own language literally translated. “The nitrum of the\r\nancients was not that substance which modern chemists call by the name\r\n(nitre or nitrate of potass), being a composition of nitric acid and\r\na vegetable alkali, but that which is called natron, being a native\r\ncombination of carbonic acid and an alkali (natron or native carbonate\r\nof soda.) And they called the harder and more stony lumps nitrum or\r\nlitrum, and the more spongy and softer aphronitrum or aphrolitrum; and\r\nspuma nitri or litri, the superficial efflorescence of the nitrum and\r\nfloury part, which was easily scraped off.” (Ad Xenoc. et Galen. de\r\nAl. ex Aquat.)—From this account it appears that the firmer and harder\r\nlumps of the native carbonate of soda were called nitrum; the softer\r\nand more spongy pieces aphronitrum, and those kinds which had a bright\r\nflorid appearance externally and readily crumbled down into a powder, the\r\nspuma nitri. Dioscorides gives a more lengthy account of its medicinal\r\nproperties than either Galen or our author, not only recommending it\r\nexternally as a stimulant and discutient application to various cutaneous\r\ndiseases and the bites of mad dogs, but also internally as an antidote\r\nto poisonous mushrooms, buprestis, bull’s blood, &c. (v, 129.) Serapion\r\nhas a very interesting chapter on nitrum and aphronitrum, but it is in a\r\ngreat measure made up from Dioscorides and Galen (c. 411.) For a further\r\naccount of the ancient nitrum, see under _Litrum_ in this section. We may\r\njust mention in this place that the aphronitrum would appear to have been\r\nmerely _Afrum nitrum_, that is to say, a variety of the nitrum or natron\r\nfound in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈχρὰς,\r\n\r\nPyrum silvestre, _the Wild Pear_; its properties are like those of the\r\ncommon pear, but more intense. It therefore agglutinates large wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides mentions that it is a species of wild pear. He\r\nrecommends it as an antidote to mushrooms. (i, 168.) Serapion and Mesue\r\ngive it the same character.\r\n\r\n\r\nἈψίνθιον,\r\n\r\nAbsinthium, _Wormwood_; it is heating in the first degree, but drying in\r\nthe third, being possessed at the same time of astringent, bitter, and\r\nacrid qualities. It therefore evacuates bilious humours in the stomach\r\nby the bowels and by urine. But in collections of phlegm it is of no\r\nservice, owing to its astringency. The juice of it is much hotter than\r\nthe herb itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides also describes two other species, the one being\r\nclearly the _Artemisia maritima_, and the other not the santonica,\r\nalthough it bears that name, but rather the _palmata_, according to\r\nthe best modern commentators. Dioscorides recommends the true wormwood\r\n(_Artemisia abrotanum_) in a great many cases, both externally and\r\ninternally; as being diuretic and preventing surfeit when taken\r\nbeforehand, relieving flatulence of the stomach and bowels; proving\r\nemmenagogue in a potion or pessary, removing the feeling of suffocation\r\ninduced by mushrooms, when drunk with vinegar, and when with wine\r\ncounteracting the poisonous effects of ixia and hemlock, the bites of\r\nthe shrew mouse and sea dragon; its vapour removing toothache, and\r\na cataplasm the intense pains of ophthalmy; as suiting in dropsical\r\naffections and diseases of the spleen, and in many other cases. He\r\nmentions a wine of wormwood made by the people about Propontis and\r\nThrace, which they used for the aforesaid purposes in the absence of\r\nfever. (iii, 23.) Pliny enumerates fully the many medicinal properties\r\nwhich were ascribed to it. (H. N. xxvii, 28.) Galen says that it is\r\nless attenuant but as desiccative as southernwood. Apuleius calls it\r\nanthelminthic. The Arabians recommend it with the same intention. Casiri\r\n(Bibl. H. A. 336.) All the authorities hold that it is cholagogue.\r\nSee in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 2), who is very full in describing\r\nthe medicinal properties of wormwood, recommending it in infusion, in\r\ndecoction, in the form of syrup, and in wine. See also Serapion (c.\r\n14); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 9.) The last\r\nof these, after giving the opinions of Dioscorides, Galen, Ruffus,\r\nPythagoras, and Oribasius, quotes Musy (Mesue?) as saying of it that it\r\nis stomachic, a whetter of the appetite, useful in jaundice, quinsy,\r\ninflammation of the eye and ear, hardness of the liver, spleen, and womb,\r\nand in dropsy. One of Serapion’s Arabian authorities commends it as a\r\ndeobstruent, and in cases of jaundice. It occurs in the list of medicinal\r\nsubstances used both by Hippocrates and Celsus. The latter recommends it\r\nas being both stomachic and diuretic. Although its use as a febrifuge has\r\nbeen superseded by a more popular medicine of the same class, we need\r\nscarcely remark that it still holds a place in our Dispensatories. The\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia contains the two species which are described by\r\nthe names of _Artemisia Absinthium_ and _Artemisia contra_. The latter is\r\nthe santonicum, its name being an abbreviation of _contra vermes_. See\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 705.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒάλανος Μυρεψικὴ,\r\n\r\nGlans unguentaria, _Nut Ben_; its inner and, as it were, fleshy parts\r\nhave detergent and incisive powers along with astringency: and therefore\r\nwhen drunk with honeyed water, to the amount of a drachm weight, it\r\noccasions vomiting and loosens the lower belly. But when taken with\r\noxycrate it is of use for obstructions of the viscera. It proves\r\ndetergent in affections of the skin when rubbed in with vinegar. Its bark\r\nis very astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no dispute that this is the ben nut, the term\r\nben being derived from the Arabians. The tree from which it is procured\r\nis said to be the _Hyperanthera moringa_ Vahl. See Ainslie (Mat. Med.\r\ni, 197.) It is further called _Myrobalanum_, but the coincidence of\r\nname must not lead the reader to identify it with the myrobalans of\r\nthe Arabians, of which we shall have occasion to give some account in\r\nanother place. Pliny gives an interesting account of it, representing\r\nthe Arabian as being the best oil in quality, and the Troglodytic or\r\nEthiopian, as the worst. (H. N. xii, 47.) Being principally used in\r\nunguents, it has often got the name of glans unguentaria. Dioscorides\r\nwrites fully of its medicinal properties, recommending it in particular\r\ninwardly, as an emetic and purgative, and externally, as an application\r\nto various cutaneous diseases, such as psora and leprosy (iv, 157.)\r\nCelsus recommends it in several places as an ingredient in emollient\r\nointments, more especially for indurations of the spleen (iv, 9; v, 18,\r\n4.) The Arabians, especially Avicenna and Serapion, treat of it at great\r\nlength, but in nearly the same terms as Dioscorides and Galen. Of late\r\nyears nut ben has been excluded from our Dispensatories; but our older\r\nauthorities in modern times confirm the characters of it given above from\r\nDioscorides, that is to say, that it acts both as an emetic and a purge,\r\nbut in the latter capacity slowly and with pain. See Hill (Mat. Med. 4,\r\n94); Rutty (Mat. Med. p. 52.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒάκχαρις,\r\n\r\nBaccharis, _Spikenard_, is a fragrant herb, like cinnamon, used for\r\ngarlands. It is acrid; and its root when boiled is deobstruent, diuretic,\r\nand emmenagogue. But its leaves being astringent are beneficial in fluxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Regarding this much disputed article, the predominance\r\nof authority, as we think, is in favour of its being some species of\r\n_Conyza_. Old Gerard gives it the English names of ploughman’s spikenard\r\nand cinnamon-root, and repeats the characters of it given by the ancient\r\nauthorities. It has been long since expelled from our Dispensatories.\r\nGalen, in his Commentary on the Glossa Hippocratica, mentions that the\r\nname is applied both to a herb and a Lydian ointment. It does not occur\r\nin the works of Celsus nor in those of the Arabians. Our author draws\r\nhis characters of it from Dioscorides, who recommends it, among other\r\npurposes, as being emmenagogue and promoting parturition (iii, 44.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒαλάυστιον,\r\n\r\nBalaustium, _the Flower of the Wild Pomegranate_; it is powerfully\r\nastringent, having also desiccant and cold powers. It heals superficial\r\nsores, and stops defluxions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Balaustine_, or the _Flower of the double Wild Pomegranate_,\r\nis an astringent medicine much used by the ancient physicians.\r\nDioscorides recommends it principally as an anthelminthic to kill the\r\nbroad ascaris, by which he meant the tænia. (See ii, 147.) Galen writes\r\nvery elaborately on this article, contending that it is a good example\r\nof a plant possessed of an astringent quality, and stating that it\r\nwas in general use with this intention externally in intertrigo and\r\nother ulcers, and internally in cases of hæmoptysis, dysentery, and in\r\nall defluxions from the stomach or womb. The Arabians give a similar\r\naccount of it, and further recommend balaustine as a whetter of the\r\nappetite, and a restorative from the ill effects of intoxication, and a\r\nmedicine calculated to stop vomiting. See in particular Serapion (129),\r\nand Avicenna (ii, 2, 109.) Although modern authority is not wanting\r\nto confirm what the ancients have stated regarding the efficacy of\r\nbalaustine as an astringent in diarrhœa, dysentery, and menorrhagia, it\r\nhas been excluded of late years from our British Dispensatories. Our\r\ncontinental brethren still make use of it. The modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\ndoes not retain the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒάλσαμον,\r\n\r\nBalsamum, _Balsam-tree_; that part of it which is like its wood is\r\ndesiccant and heating in the second degree. It is also composed of\r\nsubtile particles, but the juice of it is much more so. Its fruit is\r\npossessed of similar powers, but its particles are less subtile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This clearly is the _Balsamum Gileadense_, or Balm of\r\nGilead, being procured, as Dr. Pereira states, from the _Balsamo-dendron\r\nGileadense_, a middling-sized tree growing in Arabia. He says, it is\r\nrarely or never employed by Europeans; but is adapted to the same cases\r\nas the terebinthinates. The Asiatics use it for its odoriferous as well\r\nas its medicinal properties. Dioscorides certainly writes strongly in\r\nits favour, recommending it as a detergent application to sores and\r\ncomplaints of the eyes, and internally as an emmenagogue and diuretic,\r\nand as an antidote to poisons and venomous animals. Galen treats of it\r\nmuch more reservedly (i, 18.) The balsam occurs in Celsus’s list of\r\narticles which concoct and promote suppuration (v, 3.) The Arabians fully\r\ncoincide with the character of it given by Dioscorides. See in particular\r\nSerapion (c. 160); Avicenna (ii, 2, 81.) Though this article has almost\r\nceased to be employed in the practice of the scientific physician, it was\r\nthe instrument by which one of the most successful pieces of empiricism\r\nwas perpetrated in the beginning of this century. We allude to Dr.\r\nSolomon’s celebrated Balm of Gilead.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒαλωτὴ,\r\n\r\nBalote, by some called _Black Horehound_; it is possessed of acrid and\r\ndetergent powers; therefore, when applied with salts, it relieves the\r\nbite of mad dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There appears little reason to doubt that this is the\r\n_Ballote nigra_, or stinking horehound of our herbalists. Our author’s\r\naccount of it is abridged from Dioscorides. It is not treated of by\r\nGalen, Aëtius, nor Oribasius, neither is it found in Celsus. Avicenna\r\nand Ebn Baithar we believe are the only Arabians who notice it, and they\r\ncopy from Dioscorides (ii, 2, 553, and i, 166.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒάτος,\r\n\r\nRubus, _the Bramble_; its shrubby part is moderately astringent and\r\ndesiccant, and therefore agglutinates wounds and stops defluxions. The\r\nroot, in addition to its astringency, is attenuate in no small degree. It\r\ntherefore breaks down renal calculi. Its ripe fruit is hotter, and has a\r\nmoderate astringency. It is therefore edible; but the unripe is sour and\r\npowerfully desiccant, more especially if dried. In like manner also the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The first species of bramble described by Dioscorides is\r\nprobably that well-known one the _Rubus fruticosus_, the other is the\r\n_Rubus Idæus_, or raspberry bush. The Β. Ἰδᾶιος of Dioscorides was\r\nsupposed by Ruellius and others to be the _Fragaria_ or _Strawberry_,\r\nbut with this supposition we cannot agree. Strawberries are not noticed\r\nby any Greek writer, but are first mentioned by Ovid (Met. i, 104); and\r\nthen by Pliny (H. N. xxv, 62.) The μόρον βατῶδες, of which mention is\r\noccasionally made by our author, was the fruit of the bramble, being so\r\ncalled, according to Eustathius, from its resemblance to mulberries.\r\n(Ad Iliad. xiii, 121.) Our author abridges Galen, who is at great\r\npains in defining the powers of the batos, which he makes out to be\r\nmoderately astringent and desiccative; and hence he pronounces it to\r\nbe useful in dysentery, fluxes of the bowels, atony, hæmoptysis, and\r\nin calculus as a lithrontriptic. Dioscorides indulges in a still more\r\nlengthened exposition of its virtues, recommending the decoction of it\r\nas an astringent in looseness of the bowels, and in fluor albus, as an\r\nantidote to the sting of the serpent Prester; its leaves when chewed, to\r\nstrengthen the gums and cure the aphthæ of children, and externally, for\r\nthe cure of herpes, achor, procidentia oculi, and many other diseases\r\n(iii, 36.) It is briefly alluded to by Celsus in treating of lientery\r\n(iv, 16.) The Arabians, as usual, copy from Dioscorides and Galen. See\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 124); Avicenna (ii, 2, 572.) The rubi held their\r\nplace and ancient characters in our Dispensatories down to a late date.\r\nSee Quincy (p. 94.) Even yet several of the rubi are still kept in the\r\nshops for medicinal purposes. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p. 89.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒατράχιον,\r\n\r\nRanunculus, _Crowsfoot_, consists of four varieties, all of which are\r\npossessed of powerfully heating and desiccant powers, and also of\r\nacrid and caustic, so as to occasion ulceration with pain; but when\r\nmoderately used, it proves only detergent of the skin. The dried root is\r\na sternutatory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Sprengel, the first species is the _Ranunculus\r\nAsiaticus_; the second, the _R. lanuginosus_; the third, the _R.\r\nmuricatus_; and the fourth, the _R. aquatilis_. Galen recommends it\r\nas a powerful escharotic, and our author evidently copies from him.\r\nDioscorides gives a similar account of the ranunculi, recommending\r\nthem for the removal of leprous nails, psora, stigmata, and other\r\ntumours, as a fomentation to chilblains, and as an application to remove\r\ntoothache. The Arabians treat of the ranunculi in the same terms as the\r\nGreeks, copying their medicinal characters from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 368), and Ebn Baithar (ii, 343.) Neither of them\r\ngives anything original of his own, nor from any Arabian authority. The\r\nranunculi, we need scarcely mention, have now been discarded by the\r\nregular practitioner; but yet several of them are still kept in the\r\nshops, and have the reputation of being excellent vesicants. Gray (Suppl.\r\nto Pharmacop. p. 122.) In like manner old Culpeper affirms that the\r\ncrowsfoot is an effectual and a much safer blister than cantharides (p.\r\n59.) The modern Greek Pharmacopœia does not contain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒάτραχοι,\r\n\r\nRanæ, _Frogs_; they are eaten when made into a soup for the bites of\r\nvenomous animals; when burnt, their ashes become very desiccant; and stop\r\nhemorrhages, and cure alopecia, along with liquid pitch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, Galen, and Serapion recommend them in the cases\r\nmentioned by our author. The species with which they must have been most\r\nfamiliar is the green frog. We have stated in another place that the\r\nGreeks and Romans did not use the frog as an article of food. (Vol. I,\r\n166.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒδέλλιον,\r\n\r\nBdellium; both the Scythian and Arabian are possessed of powers which\r\nprove emollient of indurated tumours, more especially the recent. The\r\nArabian is also diuretic, lithontriptic, and digestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, as Dr. Ainslie remarks (Mat. Ind. i, 30), has\r\nsufficiently well described this article; and yet he adds afterwards,\r\nit is a lamentable fact that the actual tree from which bdellium is\r\ngot has not hitherto been clearly ascertained by botanists. He rejects\r\nthe conjecture of Sprengel, although supported by the high authority\r\nof Kæmpfer and Rumphius that it is procured from the _Borassus\r\nflabelliformis_, and also that of Matthiolus, who maintained that it is\r\nprocured from the _dwarf palm_, or _Chamœrops humilis_. Upon the whole,\r\nthe opinion of Virey, founded on the authority of Forskael, that it is\r\ngot from some species of _Amyris_, seems to be the most probable. Dr.\r\nPereira gives the following account of this article: “The term _Bdellium_\r\nis applied to two gummy resinous substances. One of these is Indian\r\nbdellium, or false myrrh, the bdellium of Scripture, which is obtained\r\nfrom _Amyris (Balsamodendron?) Commiphora_. See further Royle (Hindoos\r\nMed. p. 90.) The other kind is called _African Bdellium_, and is obtained\r\nfrom the _Heudolotia Africana_.” (Mat. Med. 1634.) On the _Bdellium_,\r\nsee further what we have said in the Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon.\r\nThe ancients would appear to have been well acquainted with both these\r\nkinds of bdellium; at all events they were acquainted with the Indian,\r\nfor Dioscorides has described it. He represents the bdellium to be\r\ncalefacient, emollient, and dissolvent, and recommends it for dissolving\r\nhard tumours, for promoting menstruation in pessaries, and fumigations,\r\nand as an emetic, diuretic, and expectorant (i, 80.) The Arabians were\r\nevidently still more familiar with the bdellium than their Grecian\r\nmasters; but have supplied little or no additional information respecting\r\nit. See in particular Serapion (De Simpl. 117), and Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n112.) Celsus recommends it frequently as an ingredient in external\r\napplications. As far as we have been able to discover, it does not occur\r\nin the works of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒεττονικὴ,\r\n\r\nBettonica, _Bettony_, is a herb having slender branches like those of\r\nthe pennyroyal, but still more slender, and is possessed of scarcely any\r\nquality to the taste. It grows mostly in rocky situations, and is used\r\nfor the composition of nephritic medicines. There is among the Romans\r\nanother herb called bettonica, to which Dioscorides gives the name of\r\ncestrum; but others name it psychotrophon, because it delights in cold\r\nsituations, having no resemblance to the aforementioned, except its\r\nmedicinal powers. In addition to its action as a diuretic, it is useful\r\nfor many other purposes; for its root in particular, when drunk with\r\nhydromel, occasions vomiting, and the leaves open the bowels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dr. Alston says, “There is a Libellus (De Betonica)\r\nattributed commonly to Augustus’s physician, Antonius Musa, by some\r\nto L. Apuleius, of which there are said to be very ancient MSS.” We\r\nhave seen the work mentioned by Alston. It is published _Tiguri_,\r\nA.D. 1537, with notes by Humelbergius. It is a small work, occupying\r\nscarcely four leaves in octavo. The author commences with a dedication\r\nto Augustus, in which he informs the emperor that the betony is useful\r\nfor forty-seven complaints, which he proceeds to enumerate, after giving\r\na short description of the herb. He says of it, “Cestron vocatur, etiam\r\npsychotrophon, siquidem frigidis reperitur in locis, radicibus tenuibus,\r\nthyrso tenui ultra cubitum quadrangulo, foliis quercui similibus, boni\r\nodoris, semine in summitate thyrsi spicato, modo thymbræ.” The following\r\nare some of the cases in which he recommends it: For fractures of the\r\nhead, as an external application; for pains of the eyes in a fomentation;\r\nfor pains in the teeth, boiled in old wine or vinegar; for consumption\r\nand difficulty of breathing; for complaints of the liver, spleen, and\r\nkidneys; as a purgative when given to the amount of four drachms in eight\r\ncyathi of hydromel; for calculus; for dropsy; to prevent intoxication;\r\nas an antidote to poisons and the bites of venomous reptiles and mad\r\ndogs; for gout, &c. Many different opinions, as stated by Sprengel,\r\nhave been entertained respecting this herb. Perhaps, as he suggests, it\r\nmay have been the _Rumex Hydrolapathum_ or _Aquaticus_. The κεστρεὺς\r\nof Dioscorides he thinks is the _B. alopecurus_. But for the general\r\nliterature of this subject, we must refer to our discussion on it in\r\nthe Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon. The betony held a place in the\r\nMateria Medica down to a very late period. Both Dioscorides and Pliny\r\nrecommend it in hæmoptysis and purulent affections of the chest, and\r\nit enters as an ingredient into several of Myrepsus’s antidotes for\r\ndysentery and cæliac affection. Celsus mentions it only in one place,\r\nwhere he says of it, that it is an useful application to the stings of\r\nvenomous snakes (v, 27, 10.) For the Arabians, see in particular Serapion\r\n(322), and Averrhoes (Coll. v, 42.) Our old herbalists and other modern\r\nauthorities who treat of betony, praise it as a vulnerary herb, and as\r\nbeing possessed of diuretic and emmenagogue faculties.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒηχίον,\r\n\r\nTussilago, _Coltsfoot_, it is also called Bechicon; it is so named from\r\nits proving useful for coughs, and orthopnœa in fumigations; and it is\r\ncomposed of a hot and watery substance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Tussilago Farfara_, or _Coltsfoot_. Both\r\nDioscorides and Galen recommend it in fumigations for the cure of coughs,\r\nand this reputation it has retained down to the present day. Though\r\nnow expelled from our Dispensatories, a patent medicine, prepared from\r\ncoltsfoot, is still in considerable celebrity. It is retained in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia (p. 67.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒλίτον,\r\n\r\nBlitum, _Blite_, is an esculent potherb, which is humid and cold in the\r\nsecond degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The blite, or _Amaranthus Blitum_, has been long celebrated\r\nas a culinary and medicinal herb. (See vol. i, 114.) Galen and\r\nDioscorides, like our author, treat of its medicinal powers in very\r\nbrief terms. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 518); Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 148); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 41); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 128);\r\nEbn Baithar (i, 154.) These Arabian authorities commend it strongly\r\nas an application in diseases of the skin, and in phthiriasis, and\r\nalso in alopecia and apostemes. Archigenes, as quoted by Rhases, says,\r\nthe blite is more laxative than the mallow. It is treated of by our\r\nolder herbalists; but has long since ceased to occupy a place in our\r\nDispensatories.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒολβὸς,\r\n\r\nBulbus; the esculent is possessed of a certain degree of bitterness, and\r\nat the same time of astringency, and is desiccative and agglutinative of\r\nwounds, and also detergent. The emetic is hotter in its properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have mentioned in the First Book that Harduin considers\r\nthe esculent bulbus to have been a species of onion, but that Sprengel\r\nrefers it to the _Muscari comosum_. In addition to the reasons there\r\nmentioned for preferring the conjecture of Harduin, we have to add the\r\naccount of it given by the Scholiast on Theocritus: βολβὸς ἔιδος βοτἀνης\r\nὀμοίας κρομμύῳ Κολχικῷ. (Idyll, xiv.) There is also a good deal of\r\nuncertainty with regard to the emetic bulbus; but the predominance of\r\nauthority is in favour of its being the _Hyacinthus comosus_. The fact of\r\nthe matter, however, we believe to be that various plants having bulbous\r\nroots are possessed of emetic powers, and that the name emetic bulbus\r\nwas often applied in a loose manner. Dioscorides merely says of its\r\nmedicinal properties, that when eaten by itself, and when its decoction\r\nis drunk, it cures diseases of the bladder and produces vomiting (ii,\r\n200, 201.) Galen and the succeeding authorities, like our author, treat\r\nvery succinctly of it. The Arabians, also, merely copy from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. See particularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 85); Serapion (c. 355.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒότρυς,\r\n\r\nBotrys, _Goosefoot_; some call it Ambrosia, and others Mugwort. It is a\r\nplant sufficiently fragrant, and when drunk with wine cures orthopnœa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems no reason to doubt that this is the plant\r\ndescribed by our old herbalists under the name of Oak of Jerusalem. It\r\nhas now got the scientific name of _Chenopodium Botrys_. It is briefly\r\nrecommended in orthopnœa by Dioscorides (iii, 120), and Pliny (N. H.\r\nxxvii, 31.) It is not noticed by Galen, Aëtius, Oribasius, Celsus, nor we\r\nbelieve by any of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, yet it\r\nheld a place in our English Dispensatory as late as the time of Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒουβώνιον,\r\n\r\nBubonium, has been described under Aster Atticus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒούγλωσσον,\r\n\r\nBuglossum, _Bugloss_, is humid and hot in its temperament. Hence when\r\nadded to wines it is said to produce hilarity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Borage, or _Anchusa Buglossum_, long held a place in the\r\nMateria Medica. From Dioscorides down to Boerhaave, it had the reputation\r\nof being a good cordial. See Dioscorides (iv, 126); Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n375.) We believe it is not met with in the works either of Hippocrates or\r\nCelsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒούνειον,\r\n\r\nBunium (or Arctium), _Rape_; it is hot, diuretic, and emmenagogue; and\r\nthe Pseudobunium in like manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We treated of this article, which, notwithstanding the\r\ndisagreement of the commentators and herbalists, we are willing to\r\nbelieve to be the _Bunium Bulbocastanum_, or Earth-nut, as a culinary\r\nherb in the First Book. The pseudobunium may be the _Pimpinella tenuis_.\r\nDioscorides represents it to be diuretic, calefacient, possessing powers\r\nto promote the lochial discharge, and useful in affections of the spleen,\r\nkidneys, and bladder (iv, 122.) Galen and the other authorities give the\r\nsame account of it as our author. It long held a place in our modern\r\nDispensatories.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒόυπρηστις,\r\n\r\nBuprestis, _Burncow_, is an insect resembling the Cantharis, and may\r\ntherefore be prepared like it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Whatever doubts others may have entertained respecting the\r\n_Buprestis_ of the ancients, we are well satisfied that it was the _Meloe\r\nvesicatoria_. We have treated fully of it as a poison in the Fifth Book §\r\n31. Occasional mention of it is made in the Hipprocratic treatises. (De\r\nMulieb. i, et alibi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒόυτυρον,\r\n\r\nButyrum, _Butter_, is possessed of digestive and moderately discutient\r\nproperties when applied to soft bodies; it is therefore of use for buboes\r\nand parotis; it attenuates the gums, more especially of children during\r\nthe time of dentition, and in a linctus it concocts humours lodged in the\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Though it certainly be true, as stated by Beckmann (History\r\nof Inventions), that the Greeks and Romans made very little use of\r\nbutter as an article of food compared with the moderns, it is equally\r\nclear that they were well acquainted with various kinds of it, and their\r\nmedicinal virtues. If, as he and Michaelis suppose, the Hebrew word,\r\nwhich, in the Septuagint Scripture, is rendered _boutyron_, signifies\r\ncream, or sour thick milk, the first mention of butter which occurs in\r\nancient literature is in the following passage of Hippocrates: “These\r\npeople (the Scythians) pour the milk of their mares into wooden vessels,\r\ncause it to be violently stirred or shaken by their blind slaves, and\r\nseparate the part which arises to the surface, as they consider it more\r\nvaluable and more delicious than that which is collected below it.” (De\r\nAere, Aquis, etc.) The _Hippace_ is also described in another of the\r\nHippocratic treatises (De Morbis, iv.) Beckmann quotes a passage of\r\nthe poet Anaxandrides, preserved by Athenæus (iv, 131, ed. Casaubon),\r\nto prove that butter is of Thracian origin. We having thus described\r\nthe origin of butter, shall now give a description of its medicinal\r\nuses from the works of the medical authorities. In the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises butter is several times mentioned as an external medicine. (De\r\nNatura Mulierum, v; De Morbis Mulierum, ii, 5.) But Dioscorides is the\r\nfirst author who gives a distinct account of its medicinal properties.\r\nButter, he says, is possessed of emollient and oily powers, whence it\r\nloosens the bowels when drunk in large quantity, and is useful in the\r\ntreatment of poisoning by deadly substances in the absence of oil; when\r\nmixed with honey, and rubbed in, it is useful for painful dentition,\r\npruritus of the gums in children, and aphthæ; when rubbed in externally\r\nit preserves the body plump and free from watery pustules (psydracia);\r\nit is beneficial for inflammations and hardness of the womb, when not\r\nfetid or old; for dysentery and ulceration of the colon, in a clyster;\r\nit is mixed advantageously with suppurative applications, and more\r\nespecially in wounds of the nerves, membranes of the brain, the bladder,\r\nand neck; it fills up, cleanses, incarnates, and proves useful as an\r\napplication in cases of persons bitten by the asp. Fresh butter in\r\ncookery is used instead of oil, and in cakes instead of suet. His chapter\r\non butter concludes with directions for preparing the sort of butter,\r\nwhich he represents as being desiccative and astringent in ophthalmic\r\napplications, and capable of stopping defluxions and cicatrizing ulcers.\r\n(ii, 81.) Pliny’s account of milk being mostly taken from Dioscorides,\r\nwe shall not dwell upon it. He is original, however, in stating that\r\nmost butter is got from cow’s milk. (H. N. xxviii, 35.) Celsus merely\r\nenumerates butter among the articles which incarnate and fill up sores.\r\n(v, 14.) Galen states that butter is contained in greatest quantity in\r\nthe milk of cows, and hence it derives its name. That it has concoctive\r\npowers with a small portion of discutient, and is of intermediate powers\r\nwith regard to softness and hardness of the body, by which he means\r\nthat it has no powers to discuss preternatural tumours of very hard\r\nbodies, but that it concocts and discusses soft inflammations, such as\r\nparotis, bubo, boils in the mouth, and many others of a like nature. He\r\nrecommends it also in dentition and inflammatory affections of the mouth\r\nin children. He also mentions it as a useful expectorant in pleurisy\r\nand pneumonia, both when drunk and in the form of a linctus. (De Simpl.\r\nix.) Aëtius copies the description which he gives of butter from Galen.\r\n(ii, 104.) Oribasius borrows from Dioscorides. (xv, 2.) Rhases quotes\r\nDioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and Paulus, and gives nothing of his own.\r\n(l. ult. 133.) Avicenna also recommends butter in exactly the same cases\r\nas Dioscorides and Galen. (ii, 2, 110.) Serapion literally translates\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (De Simpl. 457.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒούφθαλμον,\r\n\r\nBuphthalmum, _Oxeye_, has a flower like that of the camomile, but\r\nmuch larger and more acrid. It is therefore discutient, so as to cure\r\nindurations when mixed with cerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The old herbalists were much puzzled what to make of the\r\n_Buphthalmum_, some contending for its being _Helleborus niger_, some a\r\nspecies of _Consiligo_, some a _Chrysanthemum_, and so forth. See Gerard\r\n(Herbal) and Sprengel (Ad Dioscor.) It would seem likely that it is the\r\n_Anthemis Valentina_. Our author borrows all that was worth copying in\r\nthe chapter of Dioscorides (iii, 146.) Galen expresses himself respecting\r\nit in nearly the same terms as Dioscorides. For the Arabians, see\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 97.) It is not mentioned in the Hippocratic collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒράθυς,\r\n\r\nSabina, _Savin_, being like the Cypress, it is heating and desiccative in\r\nthe third degree; and consisting of subtile particles, it is possessed\r\nof subtilizing and discutient powers if drunk. It is applied to\r\nmortifications like the Cypress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The two species of savine described by Dioscorides are\r\nprobably the _Sabina cypressifolia_ and _tamariscifolia_. He recommends\r\nit principally as an external application to spreading sores and\r\ncarbuncles. He says it produces bloody water and abortion when drunk in\r\nwine, and when applied externally, or in the form of fumigation. (i,\r\n104.) All the ancient authorities, including Macer Floridus (but his\r\nworks, we are well aware, are not generally reputed genuine), hold it to\r\nbe an uterine medicine. Its medicinal and deleterious powers are given\r\nin like manner by the Arabians. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 6);\r\nSerapion (c. 255); Ebn Baithar (i, 5.) Apuleius praises it strongly in\r\njaundice. We need scarcely mention that savin still retains its place\r\nin our Dispensatory, being, according to Pereira, “the most certain and\r\npowerful emmenagogue of the whole Materia Medica.” With regard to its\r\naction on the animal economy, “it operates,” according to Sundelin, as\r\nquoted by Pereira, “as a specific excitant and irritant on the kidneys,\r\nand yet more obviously on the uterus.” All this shows how correctly the\r\nancient authorities had judged of its powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒρεττανίκη,\r\n\r\nBretannica, _Water-dock_, is possessed of astringent and agglutinative\r\npowers, and in appearance resembles the Wild-dock. The juice of it cures\r\nmortifications in the mouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would not be worth while, even if this were the proper\r\nplace, to touch upon the lengthened controversy which has prevailed among\r\nthe old herbalists and botanical authorities with regard to this plant.\r\nWhoever would wish to investigate the subject may consult Professor\r\nMunting’s elaborate work ‘De Vera Herba Britannica,’ (Amst. 1698,) and\r\nSprengel’s ‘Annotations on Dioscorides’ (iv, 2.) Suffice it to say, that,\r\nin all probability, the plant in question was some species of water-dock.\r\nAll the authorities who treat of it give it much the same character as\r\nour author. See particularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 102); Serapion (c. 222.)\r\nIt held a place in our English Dispensatory as late as Quincy, who\r\nrepresents it (“the hydrolopathum, supposed to be the Bretannica of the\r\nancients”) as a specific for scurvy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒρόμος,\r\n\r\nAvena, _Oats_, has powers resembling those of barley. It is desiccative,\r\nand moderately discutient without pungency. It has also some astringency,\r\nwhence it cures diarrhœas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is not well ascertained whether this be an _Avena_\r\nor _Secale_. The chapter of Dioscorides under this head is probably\r\nspurious. Our author abridges Galen. It is not treated of by Celsus nor\r\nthe Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΒρύον,\r\n\r\nBryum; the sea-bryum or lichen is cooling and astringent, and is\r\ntherefore useful when applied as a cataplasm to hot inflammations; that\r\nkind which is called splanchnon, being found on oaks, white poplars, and\r\npitch-trees, is at the same time discutient and moderately emollient,\r\nmore especially that upon cedars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears evident that it is a species of _Lichen_ or\r\n_Usnea_, but what species is not clear. The term usnea is borrowed from\r\nthe Arabian authors. Our author copies closely from Galen. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as an astringent principally in affections of the womb, in\r\nthe form of a hip-bath or fumigation. Avicenna (ii, 2, 713) and Serapion\r\n(c. 247) briefly notice several species of _usnea_ without appearing\r\nto identify it with the bryon of the Greeks. Rhases, however, is quite\r\naware of their identity. (Contin. l. ult. i, 753.) Avicenna says it is\r\nemmenagogue, and procures the delivery of the fœtus either dead or alive.\r\nHe adds that, in a dose of 10 drs. it acts as a deadly poison. Serapion\r\nrecommends it principally as being diuretic and emmenagogue. Several\r\nspecies of the genera lichen and usnea are still to be found in the\r\nshops, and have the reputation of being powerful astringents. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to the Pharmacop. pp. 11, 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΒρυωνία,\r\n\r\nBryonia, _Bryony_; the White Vine is so named.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See under ἄμπελος. Mesue recommends it as a phlegmagogue,\r\ndeobstruent, and diuretic medicine; for epilepsy, vertigo, coldness of\r\nthe nerves, coughs, asthmas, especially in a linctus, in pleurisy, and as\r\nan external application to hard aspostemes, inflammations of the spleen,\r\nin the form of a plaster, with figs and wine; for the removal of whitlow,\r\nspiculæ of bones, thorns, and the like. In a draught, he says, it proves\r\nemmenagogue and procures abortion. He also commends it as a cosmetic in\r\ndiseases of the face. Both internally and externally he praises it in\r\nscrofula. He adds further, that it is useful in the cure of persons who\r\nhave been bitten by venomous animals. In a word, no ancient author has\r\nbestowed so flattering an eulogium upon bryony as Mesue (De Simplicibus.)\r\nWe need scarcely say that bryony (_Bryonia dioica_ or _alba_) is now\r\nregarded in the light of a poison rather than a medicine. See Orfila\r\n(Toxicol. Gen. i, 679), and Christison on Poisons (p. 445, First edition.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓἀλα,\r\n\r\nLac, _Milk_; every sort of milk consists of three substances, a cheesy, a\r\nserous, and a fatty part, which last is contained in greatest abundance\r\nin the cow’s milk, and from it butter is formed. Whey is possessed of\r\ndetergent properties, and hence it loosens the belly if separated by\r\nboiling. The cheesy and thick part is more compact, and on that account\r\nblunts acrid humours. When milk is boiled either by hot pebbles or any\r\nother way, it is an excellent remedy for dysenteries and other acrid\r\ndefluxions on the bowels. The whole contents of milk are suitable\r\napplications for acrid humours of the eye, and all other acrimonies. The\r\nmilk of a woman is of the best regulated temperament; after which the\r\ngoat’s, and then that of the ass and sheep; and last of all the milk of\r\ncows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the properties of milk so fully in the\r\nFirst Book that we need not enlarge on the subject in this place. Our\r\nauthor’s account of it is abridged from Galen. Dioscorides, Galen,\r\nCelsus, Serapion, and most of the authorities, recommend milk as a\r\nremedy when acrid substances, such as cantharides or arsenic, have been\r\nswallowed. Dioscorides says whey is beneficial in cases of melancholy,\r\nepilepsy, lepra, elephantiasis, and exanthemata in all parts of the body.\r\nHe recommends new milk as a gargle in all ulcerations of the mouth, and\r\nin defluxions on the bowels with ulceration and tenesmus. He says, the\r\nmilk of sheep, cows, or goats stops them, when boiled with pebbles, and\r\ninjected either by itself or with ptisan, or the decoction of chondrus;\r\nit is also injected, he adds, in ulcerations of the womb. A woman’s milk,\r\nhe says, when sucked from the breast, relieves erosion of the stomach\r\nand phthisis; it suits the cure of those who have drunk of the sea-hare,\r\nand is otherwise useful as an application to the eyes, and to the\r\ngout. All kinds of milk, he adds, are inapplicable in diseased spleen,\r\ndiseased liver, vertigo, epilepsy, all nervous affections, fevers, and\r\nheadaches, unless when the schiston is given to move the bowels. What\r\nthe schiston was we have explained in the First Book (§ 88.) All the\r\nother authorities, whether Greek or Arabian, in treating of milk, follow\r\nDioscorides and Galen. See in particular Serapion (De Simpl. 457.)\r\nCelsus entertained nearly the same views, with regard to milk, as the\r\nGreek authorities. Thus he recommends it in phthisis, and as an antidote\r\nto various poisons, but condemns it in headaches and acute fevers.\r\nHippocrates prescribes milk in various instances, and seems to have been\r\nvery partial to the use of it. He recommends the schiston, prepared with\r\npebbles, in affections of the bowels. (Epidem. vii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓαλὴ,\r\n\r\nMustella, _the Weasel_; when burnt, its ashes are discutient. Wherefore\r\nwhen rubbed in along with vinegar it relieves gout and rheumatism; when\r\nprepared and dried it answers with epilepsies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Sprengel, the Γαλη is a species of mustella, but\r\nneither the _M. communis_, called _weasel_ in English, nor the _M. Furo_,\r\nor _Ferret_. Our author’s description of its medicinal virtues is taken\r\nfrom Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓάλιον,\r\n\r\nGalium, _Yellow Ladies’ Bedstraw_, or _Cheese Rennet_; it derives its\r\nname of Galium from its coagulating milk. It resembles the cleavers, and\r\nis desiccative and subacrid. The flower of it suits with hemorrhages and\r\nburns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The very name, _Galium verum_, now generally given to the\r\nyellow bed-straw, implies that it is generally admitted to be the galium\r\nof the ancients. Dioscorides, besides assigning to it the virtues\r\nenumerated by our author, states, that it is aphrodisiacal (iv, 94.) It\r\nwas principally celebrated, however, as a styptic, and this character it\r\ncontinued to hold as long as it obtained a place in the Dispensatory.\r\nSee Quincy. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 317); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 327); Ebn Baithar (ii, 229.) They all merely copy from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. We have not been able to find it in the works of\r\neither Hippocrates or Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓαλίοψις,\r\n\r\nGaliopsis (called also Galiobdolon), is like the nettle, but smoother and\r\nfetid, and acts as a discutient and emollient application to indurated\r\ntumours. It also agrees with spreading ulcers in the form of a cataplasm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our old herbalists generally held the galiopsis of\r\nDioscorides to be a species of _Lamium_. (See Gerard and Parkinson.) But\r\nwhether it be that or a species of figwort (the _Scrofularia peregrina_)\r\ncannot be positively determined. Rutty says the _Lamium maximum_ of\r\nC. Bauhin has all the marks which Dioscorides gives to the galiopsis.\r\nIt was used only externally in applications to foul ulcers, and this\r\ncharacter secured it a place in our Dispensatory until recent times. See\r\nparticularly Dioscorides (iv, 94.) Few of the other authorities have\r\nnoticed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓάρος,\r\n\r\nGarum, _Brine of Pickled Fish_, is powerfully calefacient and\r\ndesiccative, and is therefore used as an external application to putrid\r\nulcers, and is administered as an injection in dysentery and ischiatic\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. “Garum est exquisiti liquoris genus, intestinis piscium\r\ncæterisque quæ abjicienda sunt sale maceratis.” Rendtorpi Notæ ap.\r\nFabricii Bibl. Gr. iv, 333; Geopon. xx, 46; Pliny (H. N. xxxi, 43);\r\nAthenæus (Deipnos. ii); Apicius (c. vii.) Coray defines it, “the juice\r\nor brine of pickled fishes.” (Ad Xenocrat. Fragment.) Sauce prepared\r\nby macerating the intestines of the tunny was particularly esteemed.\r\nCælius Aurelianus praises that from the silurus. (Tard. Pass. ii, 1.)\r\nDioscorides recommends the sauce of pickled fishes as a cataplasm to\r\npersons bitten by dogs, and as an injection in dysentery and sciatica\r\n(ii, 34.) All the other authorities that treat of it give it the same\r\ncharacter. See Aëtius (ii); Avicenna (ii, 2, 486); Serapion (c. 184.)\r\nIt occurs in the works of Celsus (ii, 21), and also frequently in those\r\nof Hippocrates. Foës gives a learned dissertation on this article in\r\n‘Œconom. Hippocrat.’\r\n\r\n\r\nΓεντιανὴ,\r\n\r\nGentiana, _Gentian_; the root is sufficiently efficacious in subtilising\r\nand cleansing, and as a detergent and deobstruent medicine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides states that the gentian (_Gentiana lutea?_)\r\nhas a heating and astringent faculty; that it is a remedy in cases of\r\npersons bitten by venomous animals, with pepper and rue; that it is\r\nuseful in hepatic and stomachic affections; that it procures abortion\r\nwhen applied in a collyrium; that it is a vulnerary herb, and is used\r\nfor many ulcers and other cutaneous affections. (iii, 3.) Galen justly\r\nremarks that it owes its attenuant and deobstruent powers to its being\r\nintensely bitter. (De Simpl. v.) Apuleius, like Dioscorides, recommends\r\nit as an application for the bites of serpents. Hence it always obtained\r\na place in the Theriac. See Celsus (v, 23.) Serapion says it is the\r\nbest of all remedies in cases of hydrophobia, and this character it has\r\nobtained in modern times. Avicenna gives a very circumstantial account\r\nof it, enumerating all its virtues as stated by the Greek authorities,\r\nnamely, its abstergent, attenuant, deobstruent, diuretic, and emmenagogue\r\npowers, and recommends it particularly as an application to parts stung\r\nby venomous animals. (ii, 2, 281.) Ebn Baithar gives very interesting\r\nextracts from Arabian authorities on this head. (i, 260.) It is found in\r\nthe Hippocratic collection. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is stated\r\nthat the _G. lutea_ grows in the Alps of Switzerland. This would seem to\r\nimply that it is not a native of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓεράνιον,\r\n\r\nGeranium, _Cranebill_; that species, the leaves of which resemble those\r\nof the Anemone, and has edible roots, when drunk with wine to the amount\r\nof a drachm, removes inflation of the uterus. The other species is of no\r\nuse in medicine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and the other ancient authorities describe only\r\ntwo species of the _Geranium_, the former of which would certainly seem\r\nto be the _tuberosum_, and the other the _rotundifolium_. They were not\r\nacquainted with the _Geranium Robertianum_. Dioscorides merely says of\r\nthe geranium that when drunk in wine, to the amount of a drachm, it cures\r\ninflation of the womb (iii, 121.) Few of the other authorities notice\r\nit. See Ebn Baithar (i, 10.) The geraniums held a place in our English\r\nDispensatory until a recent period. See Quincy (p. 88.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓῆ,\r\n\r\nTerra, _Earth_; all kinds are desiccants; that which is unmixed with any\r\nother substance is also free of pungency; but if any fiery quality is\r\nmixed with it, it lays the same aside when washed. The fatty part, then,\r\nof wrought earth is an useful application to all organs that require\r\ndrying; they use therefore the clay of _Egyptian earth_ to dropsical and\r\nsplenitic affections, and to soft swellings, with manifest advantage. Of\r\nmedicinal earths, the _Lemnia rubrica_, or _Sigillum_, as it is called,\r\nin addition to its being moderately desiccative and astringent, proves\r\nan antidote to deleterious medicines, cures malignant ulcers with wine\r\nor vinegar, stops all kinds of hemorrhage, and removes dysentery and\r\nspreading ulcers of the intestines, the gut being first washed out by an\r\ninjection of honied water, and then of brine. The _Rubrica Sinopica_, or\r\n_vermilion_, being stronger than the Lemnian, is used as an ingredient\r\nin plasters, and when drunk it kills worms. The _Samian_ is much more\r\nemollient than the Lemnian, as being glutinous and viscid. It is to be\r\nused then in all cases in which emollients are indicated; but it also\r\ncures spitting of blood from whatever part it proceed. The _Selenusian_\r\nand the _Chian_ are more detergent, and are therefore used by some women\r\nin the cleansing applications to their faces. It also produces the\r\nincarnation and cicatrization of ulcers, more especially of burns. The\r\nunwashed _Cimolian_ is possessed of mixed powers, being refrigerant\r\nand discutient; but the washed is more cooling, and cures burns with\r\noxycrate. The _Terra Ampelitis_ (it is the kind of earth which is rubbed\r\nupon vines to destroy the worms which breed in them) is powerfully\r\ndesiccant and discutient, but not without pungency. The _Cretan_ is full\r\nof air and detergent, without pungency. The _Eretrian_ is decidedly\r\nastringent, but when burnt and washed it is desiccant without pungency;\r\nbut the cineritious is preferable. The _Pnigitis_ has powers resembling\r\nthe Cimolian, but is black. The _Armenian_, called also _Bole_, is\r\npowerfully desiccative, and therefore agrees excellently with dysenteric\r\ncases, fluxes of the belly, spitting of blood, consumption, dyspnœa from\r\nhumidity, humid ulcers, and pestilential affections. It is drunk with a\r\nthin diluted wine, or, if fever be present, with water. The _Alanabolus_\r\nis possessed of similar powers to the Armenian. _Ochre_ is discutient and\r\nseptic in its powers; it therefore restrains the fungous flesh of ulcers,\r\nand fills hollow ones when mixed with cerate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall now give a brief explanation of the medicinal\r\nearths of the ancients, and for a fuller account of them we would beg\r\nto refer to the Appendix to Dunbar’s ‘English and Greek Lexicon,’ to\r\nHill’s ‘Annotations on Theophrastus on Stones,’ and to Sprengel’s ‘Notes\r\non Dioscorides.’ Of the ancient writers, Dioscorides and Galen give the\r\nfullest account of them. The Arabians, also, especially Rhases, Avicenna,\r\nand Serapion, treat of them in the most ample manner, but supply little\r\nadditional information. Geoffroy says of the _Lemnian earth_, that it is\r\n“a fat, viscid, slippery clay, of a pale red colour.” The Lemnian ruddle\r\n(μίλτος) was the red Armenian bole, consisting of silex, alumine, oxyd\r\nof iron, &c. The Lemnium Sigillum was the Lemnian earth, made into cakes\r\nand stamped with a seal, as a guarantee of its purity. The _Cretan earth_\r\nis white chalk. The _Samian earth_, as Sprengel states, appears to have\r\nbeen pure argil; Kidd supposes it to have been pipeclay. The kind called\r\naster was globose and thick. The _Chian_, _Selenusian_, and _Pnigitid\r\nearths_, are also argils, more or less pure. The Sinopic ruddle was a\r\ncompact kind of ochre or marl, nearly resembling the Lemnian earth. Pliny\r\nranks the _Cimolian earth_ among the chalks or clays (cretæ.) Sprengel\r\nand Kidd suppose it an argil. The purple Cimolian earth of the ancients\r\nwas our steatitis or _soap-rock_. From Dioscorides’s account of the\r\n_Melian earth_, it appears to have consisted principally of alum, and was\r\ndifferent from the _Terra Melia_ of Theophrastus. The _Ampelites_ would\r\nseem to have been a bituminous earth, formed from stone-coal, probably\r\nresembling cannel coal. The _Armenian earth_, as Matthiolus remarks,\r\nwas different from the _Armenian bole_ now brought from the East. The\r\nancient is described to be a very dry clay, having the appearance of\r\nstone, and very triturable, like lime. It was much celebrated as a remedy\r\nfor the plague. See Galen, Aëtius, and Serapion. It was introduced into\r\npractice by Galen. It is clear, as Dr. Hill remarks, that it was the\r\n_yellow Armenian bole_ which Galen used; the red being first used by the\r\nArabians. Dr. Hill found it an excellent astringent and absorbent. The\r\n_Eretrian earth_ was an impure argil, of a snow-white colour. Geber makes\r\nfrequent mention of _magnesia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓήρας ὄφεως,\r\n\r\n_Senecta Serpentis_, the Slough of a Serpent, is decidedly desiccative:\r\nwhen boiled with vinegar it, therefore, cures toothache. That of the asp,\r\nwhen triturated with honey and rubbed in, sharpens the powers of vision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen and Serapion likewise recommend the skin of a snake,\r\nwhen boiled in wine or vinegar, as a remedy for earache and toothache.\r\nSee also Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 49, 530.) Dioscorides gives nearly\r\nthe same account of it, only he recommends the cast skin of the viper\r\nas an ophthalmic remedy. (ii, 19.) The serpent’s slough is still used\r\nmedicinally in the East. See Ainslie (Materia Medica, ii, 291.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓῆς ἔντερα,\r\n\r\nVermes terreni, _Earthworms_, when pounded and applied to wounded nerves,\r\nhave immediately the most wonderful effects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says that earthworms, pounded and applied,\r\nagglutinate divided nerves, and stop tertians; that, when boiled with\r\nthe grease of a goose, they cure affections of the ears when injected;\r\nthat, in like manner, when boiled in oil and injected into the opposite\r\near, they relieve toothache; and that they promote the flow of urine\r\nwhen pounded and drunk in wine. (ii, 72.) Galen commends earthworms as\r\nbeing diuretic when drunk in must. He mentions further, that, according\r\nto the report of certain physicians, earthworms have been given\r\ninternally and applied externally without burning or boiling. Of all the\r\nancient authorities, Aëtius is the fullest on the medicinal virtues of\r\nearthworms. (ii, 168.) The Arabians do little more under this head than\r\ncopy the descriptions of them given by Dioscorides, Galen, and Paulus.\r\nAvicenna recommends them, when pounded and drunk in wine, not only\r\nas being diuretic but also lithontriptic. (ii, 2, 198.) The Lumbrici\r\nterrestres, or earthworms, are described and very much commended for\r\ntheir medicinal virtues in Quincy’s ‘Dispensatory’ (p. 140), and Lewis’s\r\n‘Materia Medica’ (ii, 76.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓίγαρτα,\r\n\r\nGigarta vinacea, _Grape-stones_, are desiccative in the second degree,\r\nbut refrigerant in the first. Being, therefore, cooling, they agree with\r\nall defluxions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen mentions _Grape-stones_ as sour and astringent\r\nremedies, and, therefore, applicable in all defluxions from the bowels.\r\nAvicenna recommends the ashes of grape-stones with vinegar in torsion of\r\nthe nerves, and along with oil for contusion of the limbs and softening\r\nof the joints. (ii, 2, 723.) See also Rhases (l. ult. Cont. i, 745.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓιγγίδιον,\r\n\r\nGingidium, _Toothpick Fennel_, is possessed of no manifest heat, but\r\nis desiccative in the third degree, and astringent. It is, therefore,\r\nstomachic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of the _Daucus gingidium_, that it is a good\r\npotherb, and that as a medicine, when taken in a decoction with wine, it\r\nis diuretic and lithontriptic. (ii, 166.) Galen defines its virtues to be\r\nconsiderable astringency with slightly heating powers. The others treat\r\nof it in like terms. Few if any of the Arabians have noticed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλαύκιον,\r\n\r\nGlaucium, _Horned Poppy_, is rather disagreeably astringent, but\r\ndecidedly refrigerant, so that it cures erysipelas when the attack is not\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In the Fifth Book we have treated of the different species of\r\npoppy used by the ancients. It appears from Dioscorides that it was its\r\nexpressed juice which was used in practice. It was used principally in\r\napplications to the eyes. Our author borrows from Galen, and he follows\r\nDioscorides (iii, 90.) The Arabians recommend it, not only in affections\r\nof the eyes, but also in boils and erysipelas. See particularly Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 470); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 464.) As far as we can discover,\r\nit does not occur in the works of the Hippocratists, nor in those of\r\nCelsus. It has been scarcely known in the modern practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλαὺξ,\r\n\r\nGlaux, _Milkwort_; the herb is hot and humid in temperament, and,\r\ntherefore, promotes the formation of milk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives a very circumstantial description of it,\r\nfrom which it has been concluded that the _Glaux_ was a species of\r\n_Astragalus_. (iv, 139.) All the authorities mention it in the same light\r\nas our author, but few of them have described it. We are not aware of its\r\nhaving been used in modern practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλήχων,\r\n\r\nPulegium, _Pennyroyal_, is strongly calefacient and attenuant. Hence,\r\nwhen applied externally, it proves rubefacient. It also promotes the\r\nexpectoration of thick and viscid humours lodged in the chest and lungs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides commends the _Mentha Pulegium_ as an emmenagogue,\r\nand for forwarding delivery; and the same character has descended to it\r\ndown to recent times. See Gerard, Culpeper, Quincy, and Hill. Even at the\r\npresent day it holds a place in our Dispensatories, but with a diminished\r\nreputation: stat magni nominis umbra! The Arabians generally treated of\r\nit along with the dittany. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 461); Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n310.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλοιὸς,\r\n\r\nSordes, that of baths, is moderately heating, emollient, and discutient.\r\nIt, therefore, agrees with fissures and condylomata.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Dioscorides, with the commentaries of Matthiolus and\r\nSprengel. Suffice it to say, that the _Sordes balneorum_ was nothing but\r\nthe sweat scraped from the bodies of persons who were _shampooed_, in an\r\napartment of the bath for this purpose, namely, in the Laconicum. (See\r\nBook I, 68.) Of course it would consist of nothing but animal sweat,\r\nmixed up perhaps with either natron or the flower of beans, which was\r\ngenerally used during the process. The _Sordes gymnasiorum_ is also\r\nin like manner treated of by Dioscorides, and it must have been the\r\nsweat collected from the statues and walls of the gymnasia. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it for crude boils (phymata), desquamated surfaces, and old\r\nsores. The _Sordes palestræ_ must have been pretty much the same as the\r\n_Sordes balneorum_, and accordingly it was used in a similar manner. The\r\n_Sordes ex gymnasio_ occurs in Celsus’s list of emollients (v, 15); and\r\nis treated of likewise by the Arabians. It appears singular that mankind\r\nshould have so long retained a fancy for such an application, considering\r\nhow easy it was to find a more agreeable substitute for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλυκυρρίζα,\r\n\r\nGlycyrrhiza, _Liquorice_, is of a tepid and humid temperament, having\r\nalso some astringency. Hence it smooths asperities, not only in the\r\ntrachea but also in a scabious bladder. It also quenches thirst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear to have been rather the _Glycyrrhiza\r\nglandulifera_ than the _G. glabra_. The latter, according to C.\r\nBauhin, contains more saccharine matter than the _G._ of the ancients.\r\nDioscorides, in his usual empirical style, enumerates with considerable\r\njudgment the cases in which it may be administered with advantage; such\r\nas asperities of the trachea (hoarseness) in the form of a linctus, for\r\nardour of the stomach, ulcerations of the bladder and kidneys, and so\r\nforth (iii, 9.) All the ancient authorities, from Dioscorides downwards\r\nagree in stating that liquorice quenches thirst; and this we believe is\r\nstill the popular opinion in this country, and was the professional, down\r\nto a late date. See Rutty (Mat. Med. p. 221.) The glycyrrhiza occurs in\r\nthe works of Hippocrates, Celsus, and the Arabians. As they all give\r\nit the same characters, we need not occupy space with extracts from\r\nthem. See particularly Serapion (De Simpl. 147); Ebn Baithar (ii, 66.)\r\nAccording to the Greek Pharmacopœia the _G. glabra_ is the species now\r\nused in Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓλυκυσίδη,\r\n\r\nGlycyside, _Pæony_, (called also Pentorobon and Pæonia); its root is\r\nacrid, somewhat bitter and desiccative, having also some astringency.\r\nHence it excites the menstrual discharge, and cleanses the kidneys and\r\nliver when drunk, to the size of an almond, with wine; but if the wine be\r\naustere it restrains alvine defluxions. When appended as a periapt, it\r\ncures the epilepsy of children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel makes the two species described by Dioscorides to\r\nbe the _Pæonia officinalis_ and _Corallina_. We have mentioned in the\r\nThird Book that it has been much celebrated both in ancient and modern\r\ntimes as a cure for epilepsy when appended as an amulet. See Andreas\r\nLaurentius (De Mir. Strumar. Curat. pp. 40, 63), and Macer (De Viribus\r\nHerb.) Quincy, in his ‘Complete English Dispensatory’ (London 1769),\r\nsays of the root of peony, “the good women highly esteem necklaces made\r\nof it to hang about their children’s necks for convulsions and difficult\r\nbreeding of the teeth.” Considering the faith which many _educated_\r\npersons now repose in the virtues of galvanic rings and garters, the\r\npresent generation has little ground for laughing at the credulity of\r\nour forefathers, with respect to amulets and other phylacteries. On the\r\nPæonia, see particularly Dioscorides (iii, 147); Galen (De Simpl. v);\r\nSerapion (c. 61); Ebn Baithar (ii, 240.) The _Pæonia officinalis_ is\r\nstill retained in the Greek Pharmacopœia (p. 121.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓναφάλιον,\r\n\r\nGnaphalium, _Cudweed_, is so called because its soft leaves have been\r\nused in place of combed wool (gnaphalum.) They are white and moderately\r\nastringent, and are, therefore, drunk with austere wine for dysentery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There has been a great shifting of names by botanical\r\nauthorities of late, with regard to the _Gnaphalia_ and the cognate\r\ngenera. It seems now agreed that the medicinal cotton-weed of the\r\nancients shall be called _Otanthus maritimus_, Link. Our author borrows\r\nfrom Dioscorides and Galen, who both give exactly the same character of\r\nthis plant, and this it retained down to a very recent period. See Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓογγυλὶς,\r\n\r\nRapum, _Turnip_; the root and seed are flatulent, promote the formation\r\nof semen, and rouse to venery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The predominance of authority has determined us, after a good\r\ndeal of consideration, to set this down as the _Brassica Napo-brassica_,\r\nthe navew, or French turnip. All the authorities, in a word, from\r\nDioscorides downwards, held it to be aphrodisiacal. Dioscorides holds it\r\nto be a sovereign remedy for chilblains in fomentation, cataplasm, or\r\nprepared thus: a turnip is to be scooped out in the middle and filled\r\nwith rose-cerate, which is to be melted by placing the turnip in hot\r\nashes, when it forms an excellent application to ulcerated chilblains.\r\n(ii, 134.) Pliny likewise says of the turnip, “Est et rapo vis medica.\r\nPerniones fervens impositum sanat.” (H. N. xx, 9.) A roasted turnip\r\nis still a popular remedy in Scotland for chilblains. Galen, Aëtius,\r\nand Oribasius give brief descriptions of the _gongylis_, and from them\r\nour author copies. Celsus treats of the _napus_ and _rapum_ only as\r\npotherbs. The Arabians give a confused account of the matter; Avicenna\r\nunder _brassica_, and Serapion under _rapa_. (De Simpl. 191.) Rhases,\r\ntranslating the 134th chapter of Dioscorides, renders _gongyle_ by _Rapa\r\nrotunda_. (Cont. l. ult. 557.) Altogether it appears to us strange that\r\nsome of our late authorities should have referred the gongylis to the\r\n_Brassica oleracea_. See Dierbach (Mat. Med. Hippocrat.) The introduction\r\nof the different varieties of the latter into gardening is a very curious\r\nbut difficult subject. See Beckmann (Hist. of Invent.), and Loudon\r\n(Encyc. of Garden. 674.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓορδύλιον,\r\n\r\nGordylium (called also by some Seseli), is hot, diuretic, and\r\nemmenagogue. The root of it, when taken in a linctus, with honey,\r\npromotes expectoration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Most probably it is a species of Seseli. Either our author or\r\nsome copyist of his works has evidently been guilty of the mistake of\r\nwriting _gordylion_ for _tordylion_. See the chapter of Dioscorides on\r\nthe tordylium (iii, 56.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΓύρις,\r\n\r\nPollen, _Fine Flour_, resembles starch in its properties, but is weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On the medicinal properties of _pollen_, see Pliny (H. N.\r\nxxii, 60), who, however, borrows all his information from Dioscorides\r\n(ii, 107.) Both recommend the pollen used for glueing books, in\r\nhæmoptysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nΓύψος,\r\n\r\nGypsum, _Parget_, or Mineral White, in addition to its desiccant, is\r\npossessed of obstruent powers. Hence it agrees with hemorrhages, along\r\nwith pollen and the white of an egg. When burnt it has no longer its\r\nobstruent powers, but it is more desiccant and repellent, especially with\r\noxycrate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated pretty fully of this article in another\r\nplace (Vol. II, 233.) It is the sulphate of lime, of which selenite\r\nor the foliated sulphate of lime is a sub-species. In the shops, when\r\npulverized, it is known by the names of mineral white and stucco.\r\nDioscorides merely says of its medicinal powers, that it is styptic\r\nand emplastic, and restrains bleeding and sweats. Galen is somewhat\r\nfuller in his account of it, recommending it, with the fine flour of\r\nwheat, which is found sticking about the walls of mills, and the down\r\nof a hare, for stopping bleeding. Aëtius and our author copy closely\r\nfrom Galen. Serapion borrows both from Dioscorides and Galen (c. 379.)\r\nAvicenna recommends it with Armenian bole, lentils, myrtle-water, and\r\nsome vinegar, as an application to the forehead in bleeding from the\r\nnose. (ii, 2, 284.) Rhases copies verbatim from Galen, Dioscorides,\r\nand our author. (Cont. l. ult. i, 235.) Averrhoes recommends it in the\r\nmanner described above from Galen as a styptic. (Collig. v, 43.) Celsus\r\nprescribes it for stopping colliquative sweating in cardiac disease (iii,\r\n19.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔάδες,\r\n\r\nTedæ, _Dead Pines_, have certain acrid, concoctive, and detergent powers.\r\nHence boiled in vinegar they cure toothache when the mouth is rinsed\r\nwith the vinegar; but if a little honey is added, they bring away phlegm.\r\nWhen made into a linctus they promote the discharges from the breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This term properly signifies a small torch used in performing\r\nlustrations, but here it is used for a small slip taken from a pine-tree.\r\nThe tree from which the _tedæ_ were taken was the _Pinus Cembro_; this\r\nMatthiolus, Harduin, and our old herbalists have clearly made out. See\r\nin particular Parkinson (p. 1537.) Gerard calls it by the English name\r\nof torch-pine, and, evidently copying from Dioscorides, adds, “the\r\ntorch-pine, cut into small pieces and boiled in vinegar, is a remedy\r\nagainst the toothache, if the teeth be washed with the decoction.” (p.\r\n1361.) The other authorities treat of it in general terms, under the head\r\nof Pinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔαμασκηνά,\r\n\r\nDamascena, _Damascenes_, will be treated of with Plums.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔαμασσώνιον,\r\n\r\nDamasonium, _Water-plantain_, has certain detergent powers, and proves\r\nlithontriptic, and occasions a metastasis of the contents of the\r\nintestinal canal to the urine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Alisma_ of Dioscorides,\r\nand therefore probably the elegant water plant now called _Alisma\r\nPlantago_. On this point see Gerarde, Parkinson, Cordus, and Sprengel.\r\nDioscorides recommends its root in cases of poisoning by the sea-hare,\r\nthe red frog, and by opium; in tormina and dysentery when drunk by itself\r\nand with carrot; and in convulsions and hysterical complaints. He adds,\r\nthat the herb binds the belly, is emmenagogue, and softens swellings when\r\napplied. (iii, 159.) Galen states that he had never any experience of it\r\nin the cases mentioned by Dioscorides; but that he had found it possessed\r\nof lithontriptic powers. The other Greek authorities follow him. The\r\nArabians copy from both. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 244, 249); Ebn Baithar (ii,\r\n513.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔαῦκος,\r\n\r\nDaucus, _Carrot_ (called also Staphylinus), consists of two varieties.\r\nThe root of the cultivated carrot is flatulent and aphrodisiacal; the\r\nseed of the wild is wholly devoid of flatulent properties, is diuretic\r\nand emmenagogue; and so in like manner the stem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Of the three species of _Daucus_ described by Dioscorides\r\n(iii, 76), the leaves of the first are compared by him to those of the\r\nfennel; the leaves of the second to those of the wild parsley; and the\r\nleaves of the third to those of coriander. The first is the species which\r\nwas long known in this country by the name of Candy carrots, and which\r\nhas obtained various names of late years from our botanical authorities.\r\nIt seems now settled that it should be called _Athamanta Cretensis_. “The\r\nsecond,” says our indefatigable herbalist, old Parkinson, whose practical\r\nacquaintance with all sorts of plants entitles his opinion to high\r\nconsideration, “is acknowledged to be so like the first that the climate\r\nand country only make the difference.” It is now called _Athamanta\r\ncervaria_. The third, or coriander-leaved daucus, as the same authority\r\nclearly indicates, was probably a species of _seseli_. It, however,\r\nis not very certainly determined. The following description of their\r\nmedicinal virtues by our Quincy may be said to embody the concurrent\r\nopinions of all the ancient authorities, Greek, Roman, and Arabian. “The\r\nseed is aperient and good in disorders of the kidneys; as also to hasten\r\ndelivery, and bring away the after-birth. It is likewise accounted a\r\ngood alexipharmic, and proper against the bites of venomous creatures.”\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 214, 287); Ebn Baithar (ii, 462); Celsus (v, 23);\r\nHippocrates (De Ratione Vict. in Acut.); also under Staphylinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔάφνη,\r\n\r\nLaurus, _The Bay-tree_; its leaves are powerfully desiccant and\r\ncalefacient, but its fruit still more so. The bark of its root, being\r\nbitter and sub-astringent, proves lithontriptic and cures hepatic\r\naffections when drunk to the amount of three oboli with fragrant wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔάφνη πόα,\r\n\r\nLaurus herba (Ruscus? _Butcher’s-broom?_), called also Alexandrina, is\r\nhot, acrid, and somewhat bitter; it therefore promotes the menstrual and\r\nurinary discharges. The daphnoides and the chamædaphne are possessed of\r\nthe same powers; but the latter is edible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes the virtues of the bay-tree (_Laurus\r\nnobilis_) at considerable length, representing it to be heating\r\nand emollient, and hence he says, the decoction of it makes a good\r\nhip-bath in diseases of the womb and bladder; the green leaves, he\r\nadds, are sub-astringent, and hence prove useful when applied to the\r\nstings of wasps and bees. He recommends the berries in phthisis and\r\nother complaints of the chest, as alexipharmic, and as forming a good\r\napplication to leprosy, and as an injection in earache and deafness. The\r\nbark, he says, is lithontriptic, kills the fœtus in utero, and proves\r\nuseful in hepatic diseases. (i, 106.) Galen briefly calls it diuretic\r\nand emmenagogue. The Arabians follow Dioscorides. See Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n444.) The _Laurus_ still holds a place in the Materia Medica, although\r\nnow seldom used. See Pereira (p. 800.) The concurrent authority of the\r\ncommentators and herbalists has settled that the Laurus Alexandrina was a\r\nspecies of _Ruscus_, probably the _R. hypophyllum_. The chamædaphne was\r\nalso a species of _Ruscus_, perhaps the _racemosus_. The daphnoides is\r\ngenerally held to be the mountain laurel of Parkinson, i. e. the _Daphne\r\nAlpina_. All the other authorities treat of these plants in nearly the\r\nsame terms as our author. They are all generally held to be emmenagogue\r\nand diuretic.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔέρμα,\r\n\r\nPellis, _Skin_; that of a sheep newly taken off and still warm,\r\nwhen applied to those who have been scourged with rods, cures them\r\nwonderfully. The skin of the hippopotamus, when burnt and triturated\r\nwith water and applied, disperses hard tubercles. That of the viper,\r\nwhen triturated and applied in cases of alopecia, promotes the growth\r\nof the hair in a wonderful degree. The leather of old shoes burnt has\r\ndesiccative ashes; hence it cures sores in the feet from friction, if not\r\nin an inflamed state; and also burns, intertrigo, and protuberances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have mentioned, in the Fourth Book, that the fresh skin\r\nof a newly-killed sheep was esteemed an excellent application to parts\r\nwhich had been bruised or cut by scourges. (See Vol. II, 46.) Dioscorides\r\nand most of the other authorities recommend the ashes of old shoes in the\r\ncases mentioned by our authors. Avicenna recommends the fresh skin of a\r\ngoat as an application to poisoned wounds. (ii, 2, 539.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔίκταμνον,\r\n\r\nDictamnum, _Dittany_, consists of more subtile particles than pennyroyal,\r\nbut resembles it in other respects. That variety called Pseudo dictamnum\r\nis weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the Dictamnus Creticus, so celebrated even in poetry\r\n(Virg. Æn. xii, 412) as a vulnerary herb, was a species of _Origanum_,\r\nhas been long known and acknowledged. Until of late years it held a\r\nplace in our Dispensatories under the name of dittany of Candy. It\r\nwas always held to be alexipharmic, and as such it is commended by\r\nDioscorides. Such, he adds, is the power of this herb that by the smell\r\nand touch it kills venomous reptiles; and the juice of it when poured\r\ninto a wound inflicted by an iron instrument or the bite of a venomous\r\nanimal immediately cures it. (iii, 34.) Galen would appear to have been\r\nsceptical as to the great medicinal powers said to be inherent in this\r\nplant, for he dismisses it with a brief notice to the effect that it\r\nis more attenuant than the pennyroyal, but like to it otherwise. See\r\nalso Celsus (v, 25.) The Arabians follow Dioscorides, and represent it\r\nto be diuretic and emmenagogue. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 461) and Serapion\r\n(De Simpl. 310.) They describe it along with the pennyroyal. The\r\nbastard dittany has been pretty generally recognized as the _Dictamnus\r\nFraxinella_. See Parkinson, Miller, and Pereira (ii, 1652, ed. sec.)\r\nThe last of these authors remarks regarding it, that “it was formerly\r\nmuch used in medicine, but of late years has fallen into almost total\r\ndisuse.” Not very many years ago, however, it was in great repute as\r\nbeing diuretic, emmenagogue, alexipharmic, anthelmintic, &c. See Alston’s\r\nLectures (i, 434.) It is still esteemed by the Arabians and Persians as a\r\ntonic and stimulant. Ainslie (Mat. Med. 63.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔιονυσίας,\r\n\r\nDionysias, is treated of under Androsæmum.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔιφρυγὲς,\r\n\r\nDiphryges, _Husk of Brass_, is possessed of mixed powers, being somewhat\r\nastringent and moderately acrid. It is therefore a good application for\r\nmalignant ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives a very circumstantial description of three\r\nvarieties of this substance, which for many years has been lost sight of.\r\nMatthiolus calls it the Husk of Bronze, and Sprengel says it is called\r\n_Kupfermulm_ in Germany. Rutty ranks it among the obsolete medicines of\r\nthe ancients. (Mat. Med. pr. 27.) Rhases treats of it. (Cont. ult. 256.)\r\nSee Serapion (c. 418.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔιψακὸς,\r\n\r\nDipsacus, _Teasel_; the root of this thorn is desiccant in the second\r\ndegree, and is also somewhat detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The root of the _Dipsacus fullonum_, or manured teasel, is\r\npraised by Dioscorides as an application to fissures and fistulæ of the\r\nanus, and it held a reputation in these cases down to a late period.\r\nSee Rutty (Mat. Med. 168.) Dioscorides further mentions its use as an\r\namulet in quartans, for which also it was long celebrated; for our Quincy\r\nspeaks of “the superstition of some people of his day in using it as a\r\ncharm against agues.” (Complete Dispensatory, 117.) For the Arabians,\r\nsee particularly Serapion (c. 106) and Ebn Baithar. It is not noticed by\r\nHippocrates nor Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔορύκνιον,\r\n\r\nDorycnium, _Shrub Trefoil (?)_, is of a similar temperament with the\r\npoppy and mandragora, that is, immoderately cold. When taken in a small\r\nquantity it occasions torpor, and in larger doses it proves fatal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In the Fifth Book we have stated the difficulty of\r\ndetermining what it was. Authorities are divided between the _Convolvulus\r\nDorycnium_ L. (Angl. Shrubby Bindweed), the _Solanum Sodomæum_, and\r\n_Atropa Belladonna_. Dioscorides says of it that it is soporific, and\r\nwhen taken in large doses proves fatal; he adds, some affirm that the\r\nseed of it is sought after for philtres, or love potions. (iv, 75.) Galen\r\ngives nearly the same account of it under the name of _Dorycnidium_. The\r\nArabians would appear not to have admitted it into the Mat. Med., for the\r\nDoronicon of Serapion is a different plant. (c. 335.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΔρακόντιον,\r\n\r\nDracontium, or Dracunculus, _Dragon-herb_, somewhat resembles the\r\nWake-robin (Arum), but is more acrid and bitter than it, and also hotter,\r\nand consists of more subtile particles. It has also some astringency. The\r\nroot of it, therefore, when taken in a potion cleanses the bowels, and\r\nis an excellent application to malignant ulcers; and the leaves in like\r\nmanner. But the fruit of it is stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the Dragon-herb (_Arum Dracunculus_)\r\nas an article of food in another place. (Vol. I, p. 114.) Dioscorides\r\ngives so circumstantial a description of its medicinal properties that\r\nwe cannot find space for it. Suffice to say, he uses it internally\r\nin diseases of the chest, and as an aphrodisiac, externally, in\r\nvarious cutaneous diseases, in collyria, in injections into the ears,\r\nand as an alexipharmic. (ii, 195.) Galen embodies the substance of\r\nDioscorides’s empirical description of its virtues agreeably to his own\r\nsystem, recommending it principally as a deobstruent internally, and\r\nan application to sores and cancerous tumours externally. Aëtius also\r\ngives an elaborate description of its powers. Oribasius merely states in\r\ngeneral terms that it is calefacient and attenuant. Apuleius recommends\r\nit for the bite of the asp. Mesue ascribes to it powerfully cathartic and\r\ncarminative powers. His account of it is very elaborate, and deserving of\r\nmore attention than we can afford room to bestow upon it. He recommends\r\nit in the form of a suppository to relieve hemorrhoids and flatulence.\r\n(De Simpl. 24.) Avicenna borrows largely from Dioscorides. (ii, 2, 432.)\r\nRhases copies from Dioscorides, Galen, and Oribasius. (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n257.) Serapion does the same. (De Simpl. 43.) It remains to be mentioned\r\nthat Dioscorides, Oribasius, Mesue, and Avicenna, besides the species\r\nof dracunculus which we have been treating of, also describe another by\r\nthe name of the Lesser. It is supposed to be the _Arum Italicum_. The\r\ndragon-herb held a place in the Dispensatory down to a very late date.\r\nBoerhaave calls it a powerful diuretic and promoter of the menses. Quincy\r\nsays it is reckoned alexipharmic.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔρυοπτερὶς,\r\n\r\nDryopteris, _Oak-fern_, is sweet, acrid, and bitterish, and its root has\r\nsome sourness. It is septic, and hence it is depilatory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Dierbach, it comprehends both the _Polypodium\r\nDryopteris_ and the _Asplenium Adiantum nigrum_, and this opinion is\r\nsupported by that of the older authorities. See Parkinson (1042) and\r\nAlston (§ 52.) Sprengel refers it to the former. Our author borrows\r\nfrom Dioscorides, and Avicenna does the same. (ii, 2, 219.) Our older\r\nherbalists, Parkinson and Gerard, treat of the oak-fern, but it has long\r\nceased to hold a place in our Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nΔρῦς,\r\n\r\nQuercus, _the Oak_; its leaves and fruit are possessed of desiccant and\r\ntepid powers, so as to agglutinate recent wounds and cure incipient\r\ninflammations. The membrane under the bark of the acorn which surrounds\r\nthe fleshy part of the fruit being much more astringent, is given for the\r\nfemale fluor and other diseases attended with discharges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dierbach states that three species of the oak with edible\r\nroots grow in Greece, the _Quercus Æsculus_, the _Q. Ilex_, and the _Q.\r\nBallote_. He adds, that the first species is generally meant by δρῦς in\r\nthe Hippocratic writings. Eustathius remarks that the φηγὸς of Homer\r\nwas a species of oak. (Ad Iliad. v, 691.) In fact, it was the _Quercus\r\næschylus_, or rather comprehend it and the _Q. Robur_. See Parkinson\r\n(1389.) After all the illustration which the subject has received from\r\nthe old herbalists, and more recent commentators on Dioscorides and\r\nTheophrastus, it must be admitted that there is still considerable\r\ndifficulty in determining the various species of oak described by the\r\nancients. Our author borrows his account of the medicinal powers of the\r\noak from Dioscorides, whom all the other authorities also follow. The\r\nquercus occurs in the Mat. Med. of Hippocrates, and in those of all the\r\nArabians. We need scarcely add that the _Quercus Robur_ still maintains a\r\nplace in our Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜβενος,\r\n\r\nEbenus, _Ebeny_; the wood is calefacient, detergent, and consists of\r\nsubtile particles. Hence it is believed to remove films which obstruct\r\nthe pupil, and is an ingredient for other ophthalmic remedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Latin poet Virgil, who applies the term India both to the\r\nregion of the East, which has always held that name, and to Abyssinia\r\n(Georg. iv, 293), says, that India is the only country that produces\r\nebeny. (Georg. ii, 116.) This account of it will still be admitted to\r\nbe pretty correct. Dr. Royle mentions that “_Diospyros Ebenus_ yields\r\nthe best kinds in the Mauritius, perhaps also in Madagascar; but _D.\r\nebenaster_ and _D. melanoxylon_, the ebeny trees of the Coromandel coast,\r\nyield it in the peninsula, of very good quality, as other species do in\r\nother parts of India.” (Hindoo Med. 89.) See Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 48.)\r\nIn medicine it was principally used in collyria for psorophthalmia and\r\nxerophthalmia as recommended by Dioscorides (i, 129), and in old ulcers\r\nand watery pustules as recommended by Aëtius (i) and Galen. (De Simpl.\r\nvi.) See also Celsus (v, 12.) The Arabians, who must have been still\r\nmore familiar with it than the Greeks, say of it, in addition, that it\r\nis lithontriptic. Rhases (Contin. l. ult. 258), Avicenna (ii, 2, 226),\r\nand Serapion (c. 152.) It is still imported to this country, but has long\r\nceased to occupy a place in our Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘγκέφαλον,\r\n\r\nCerebrum, _Brain_; the boiled brains of a hare when rubbed in and eaten,\r\nare useful (it is said) for forwarding dentition in infants. Some write\r\nthat brain when eaten proves useful for tremblings. Dioscorides says\r\nthat the brain of a cock when drunk with wine relieves those who have\r\nbeen bitten by venomous animals, and that it stops hemorrhages from the\r\nmeninges. Galen says that the brain of a camel when dried and drunk with\r\nvinegar cures epilepsy, and that of the weasel in like manner; that\r\nthe brain of a swallow with honey is of use in suffusions; while that\r\nof sheep when prepared in like manner is an excellent remedy in the\r\ndentition of children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen and Serapion treat of the medicinal properties of\r\nbrains in much the same terms as our author. Indeed our author copies\r\nfrom Galen. Avicenna says brains prove emetic after food, and are useful\r\nin the case of a person who has swallowed any poison. (ii, 2, 125.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλάια,\r\n\r\nOlea, _the Olive_; the green shoots of it are possessed of the same\r\ndegree of coldness as of astringency; the fruit when perfectly ripe is\r\nmoderately hot, but the unripe is more astringent and cold. The tear\r\nof Ethiopian olive resembling the slender ammoniac, is possessed of\r\ndetergent powers. It is used, therefore, for cicatrices, albugo, and\r\ndimness of vision, and for the pains of the teeth when put into the\r\ncarious hole. But some say that it is the wild olive that does this.\r\nOil from fully ripe olives is sweet and moderately hot, and rather of\r\na moistening nature. But the unripe has just as much astringency as\r\ncoldness. The washed is freer from pungency. As to the old, the older it\r\nis so much the hotter and more discutient is it, more especially if it\r\nconsist of subtile particles at first. This is ascertained from its being\r\npure and transparent, and from a small quantity of it being sufficient to\r\nanoint a large part of the body, and from its being readily drunk in by\r\nthe skin. Such in particular is the Sabine. That from the wild olive is\r\nat the same time detergent, astringent, and drying, as an oil. Castor oil\r\nhas the same powers as old oil. The other kinds, such as that of sesame,\r\nor of radish and the like, derive peculiar properties from the substance\r\nthey are formed from.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the olive as an article of food in another\r\nplace. (Vol. I, 135.) The Ethiopian or wild olive comprehended several\r\nspecies of the _Elæagnus_. The tears of it, mentioned by Dioscorides\r\nand our author, and likened to gum ammoniac, are now unknown. Some, as\r\nParkinson remarks, have supposed it our gum elemi, but that is probably a\r\nmistake. All the authorities, Greek, Latin, and Arabian, mention it as a\r\nsour, astringent medicine. Samonicus calls it “succis oleaster acerbis.”\r\nAbu l’Fadli calls it a powerful astringent. (Apud Celsii Hierobot.) The\r\nleaves of the cultivated olive Dioscorides says have the same kind of\r\npowers as the wild, but in an inferior degree, and hence, from their\r\ngreater mildness, they are more suitable for ophthalmic remedies; he\r\nalso recommends the juice of the green olive in pityriasis, psora, and\r\nother cutaneous diseases. (i, 136.) We need not follow out what has been\r\nwritten by the others on this subject.\r\n\r\nἜλαιον. For an account of the oils used by the ancients in the practice\r\nof medicine, see in particular Dioscorides (i, 29 et seq.), Galen (De\r\nSimpl. vi), and Mesue (De Oleis.) The _Oleum Cicinum_, i. e. oil of the\r\npalma christi, now called _castor oil_, is often mentioned by the ancient\r\nauthors. Dioscorides states that it is purgative and anthelminthic.\r\nAëtius states that _linseed oil_ may often be used instead of it. _Almond\r\noil_ he particularly commends in complaints of the ears. The _oil of\r\nSesame_, he says, resembles common oil, being a gentle purgative; it is\r\nthe _gingilie_ oil of the modern Hindoos. Serapion recommends the oil\r\nof olives as an astringent application to stop profuse perspiration,\r\nto remove scabies and other cutaneous complaints on the head, to cure\r\naphthæ and ulcers of the mouth, and for various other complaints. He,\r\nhowever, merely copies from Dioscorides, (i, 136.) But of all the\r\nancient authorities, Mesue is the one who gives the fullest account of\r\nthe composition and medicinal powers of the oils. Some of them are not\r\ndescribed by the Greeks before his time, as far as we know. We shall give\r\na specimen of a few of his prescriptions. His _oil of mandragora_, which\r\nhe recommends for extinguishing inflammation and procuring sleep, is\r\nprepared from equal parts of the juice of its berries and oil of sesame\r\nboiled in a double vessel until the juice be evaporated. Add, he says,\r\na little juice and boil again, do so a third time, and lay it aside.\r\nFor the oil of mandrake a much more complicated receipt is given by\r\nMyrepsus (xvi, 50), which held its place in our Pharmacopœia down to the\r\ndays of Quincy. (Complete Dispensatory, 527.) The _oil of eggs_, which\r\nMesue commends strongly from experience for cleansing the skin, curing\r\ncutaneous eruptions, making hair grow, and curing malignant ulcers, he\r\ndirects to be prepared thus: about thirty yelks of eggs hardened by\r\nboiling, and broken down into pieces, are to be fried in an earthen\r\nfryingpan that has been leadened, stirring with a wooden or iron ladle\r\nuntil they grow red, and their oil is poured out, which they yield the\r\nmore largely if compressed with the ladle. This oil of eggs is described\r\nin similar terms by Moses Charras, in the Royal Pharmacopœia (p. 200),\r\nand is a popular remedy in Scotland to this day. Mesue describes the\r\ncomposition of an oil of frogs, which he recommends much for soothing\r\nthe pains of arthritis, and the burning heat of ardent fevers, also the\r\noil of vipers, of wolves, and many others, which will be more properly\r\ntreated of by us in section xx of this Book. The oils are also well\r\ndescribed by Aëtius (i) and Myrepsus (De Oleis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλαιόμελι,\r\n\r\nElæomeli, _Honeyed Oil_. In Syria, an oil thicker and sweeter than honey,\r\nflows from a certain trunk; when drunk to the amount of two cyathi with\r\na hemina of water, it produces a discharge of crude and bilious matters\r\nfrom the bowels. Those who have taken it become torpid; yet one need not\r\nbe alarmed, but only rouse them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny describes it as a natural exudation from trees on\r\nthe maritime coasts of Syria. He adds, it is fat, thicker than honey,\r\nthinner than resin, of a sweet taste, and is used in medicine: “Manat\r\nex arboribus pingue, crassius melle, resina tenuius, sapore dulci, et\r\nhoc medicis.” (H. N. xxv, 7.) He states in another place that it is a\r\nnauseous purgative. (xxiii, 56.) Dioscorides gives the same account of it\r\nas our author, and describes an oil to be prepared from it. Avicenna and\r\nRhases recommend it as an application to ulcerated scabies. It appears\r\nsingular that this natural substance should have been entirely lost\r\nsight of in modern times, inasmuch that unless we adopt the conjecture\r\nof Alston, that it was some species of manna, we must admit ourselves\r\nentirely ignorant of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλατήριον,\r\n\r\nElaterium; the juice of the fruit of the wild cucumber is so called,\r\nbeing in the second order of calefacients. It promotes the menstrual\r\ndischarge, and destroys the fœtus when applied in a pessary, by its\r\nextreme bitterness. When rubbed in with milk it evacuates by the nose.\r\nWhen administered in an injection, it occasions a discharge downwards of\r\nphlegm, and sometimes of blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear that Hippocrates applied the term to all\r\ndrastic purgatives. See Eustathius, Iliad. (xviii, 564.) By Dioscorides\r\nand all subsequent authorities, it is restricted to signify the fecula\r\nof the _Momordica Elaterium_, or wild cucumber. It was much used by the\r\nancient physicians in the cure of dropsy, as we have stated in the Third\r\nBook. Dioscorides correctly states that it evacuates bile and phlegm,\r\nboth upwards and downwards. He recommends it particularly in cases\r\nattended with difficulty of breathing. As an emetic, he directs us to\r\nadminister it in oil, or with the ointment of iris. As a purgative, he\r\nrecommends it to be given with double the quantity of salt and some\r\nmustard, in the form of a pill, of the size of a tare. Like our author,\r\nhe states that it is emmenagogue, and proves fatal to the fœtus when\r\napplied in a pessary. Galen and the other authorities on the Materia\r\nMedica give it nearly the same characters. Theophrastus states that it\r\nis the most durable of all medicines, and that the oldest is the best.\r\n(H. P. ix, 14.) It is said by Hippocrates, that if a woman or she-goat,\r\ngiving suck, partake of elaterium, it will affect her young. (Epid. vi,\r\n5.) Galen in his commentary remarks, that other purgatives have the same\r\neffect when given similarly. (Op. t. v, 218, ed. Basil.) The Arabians\r\nalso show a good practical acquaintance with this substance. Thus, for\r\nexample, Avicenna praises it strongly in affections of the chest attended\r\nwith difficulty of breathing, and more especially in cases of dropsy.\r\nHe recommends it also in the form of a clyster for the cure of diseases\r\nof the joints and sciatica, and speaks of a plaster of it for the gout.\r\nHe directs a pill to be prepared from it with double the quantity of\r\nsalt. He states correctly that it occasions evacuations of phlegm and\r\nblood; that it is diuretic, and emmenagogue, and kills the child in a\r\nsuppository. (ii, 2, 177.) Mesue also writes of the wild cucumber and\r\nelaterium with great precision, recommending the latter internally as\r\nan emetic, a phlegmagogue, and a hydragogue, more especially in dropsy.\r\nHe also recommends it in jaundice, and _engorgement_ of the liver\r\nand spleen; and states that it is most beneficial in sciatica when\r\nadministered in a clyster or applied as a plaster. He speaks highly of\r\nthe efficacy of the roots of the wild cucumber when applied to the head,\r\nin a cataplasm for hemicrania, and as an errhine in the same complaint.\r\n(De Simpl. ix.) Serapion also, in treating of the wild cucumber, gives\r\ninteresting extracts, both from Greek and Arabian authorities, respecting\r\nthe medicinal powers of elaterium. (De Simpl. 204.) Ebn Baithar gives a\r\nmost ample account of it. (ii, 276.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλάτη,\r\n\r\nAbies, _the Fir_; this tree is calefacient and desiccative, like the\r\nblack poplar. Its resin will be treated of among the resins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Pinus Abies_, L. The other\r\nauthorities in general do not treat of it, except under the resinæ. It\r\ndoes not otherwise occur in Dioscorides, Galen, Serapion, or Avicenna.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλατίνη,\r\n\r\nElatine, _the Toadflax_; this herb is like the Helxine, and is moderately\r\nrefrigerant and astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the Fluellin or Female Speedwell (_Linaria Elatine_)\r\nis the elatine of the ancients has been long known and almost generally\r\nadmitted. See Parkinson, Gerard, Rutty, &c. Dioscorides recommends the\r\nleaves with flour for inflammations and running of the eyes, and for\r\ndysentery. Pliny, evidently translating Dioscorides, says of the elatine,\r\n“eadem cum line semine cocta sorbitionis usu dysenteria liberat.” (H. N.\r\nxxvii, 50.) It would appear that it had been omitted by the Arabians. It\r\nheld a place in our Dispensatory with its ancient character down to a\r\nlate period. See Parkinson, Gerard, Quincy, Rutty, and Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλαφόβοσκος,\r\n\r\nPabulum cervi (_Parsnip?_), is of heating and drying powers in the second\r\ndegree, and consists of subtile particles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our older herbalists and commentators are pretty well agreed\r\nin holding it to be the garden parsnip (_Pastinaca sativa_.) Dioscorides\r\npronounces it to be alexipharmic, and Aëtius does the same. The other\r\nauthorities treat very briefly of it. Avicenna calls the _Pastinaca_\r\naphrodisiacal, and this reputation it maintained down to modern times.\r\nSee Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλελίσφακος,\r\n\r\nSalvia, _Sage_, is decidedly calefacient and subastringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The sage (_Salvia officinalis_) has held a place in the\r\nMateria Medica from the earliest ages down to our times. Dioscorides\r\ncalls it diuretic, emmenagogue, alexipharmic, and vulnerary. The other\r\nGreek authorities, like our author, speak more moderately in its praise.\r\nThe Arabians who treat of it follow Dioscorides. See Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n153.) In modern times it was at one period held in much esteem. See\r\nQuincy. It is retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia (p. 142.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἙλένιον,\r\n\r\nInula, _Elecampane_ (?); it is calefacient and desiccative with some\r\nrecrementitious humidity. When mixed with linctuses it promotes\r\nexpectoration, and it acts as a rubefacient to the parts it is applied to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the other authorities give the elecampane (_Inula\r\nHelenium_) much the same characters as our author. Dioscorides says the\r\nroot is calefacient, and proves diuretic and emmenagogue; that in a\r\nlinctus, with honey, it is useful in coughs, orthopnœa, and the like;\r\nand, further, that it is carminative and alexipharmic. The leaves he\r\nrecommends in a cataplasm with wine for ischiatic disease, and in powder\r\nfor hæmoptysis. (i, 27, 28.) Galen’s character of it mainly agrees\r\nwith that of Dioscorides, that is to say, he recommends elecampane,\r\ninternally, in chest complaints, and externally as a rubefacient in\r\nsciatica, hemicrania, and a disposition of the joints to dislocation. The\r\nArabians give it all the characters ascribed to it by the Greeks, namely,\r\nof being diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, carminative, alexipharmic,\r\nand rubefacient externally; and, further, hold of themselves that it is\r\ncordial. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 235), and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 237.)\r\nSerapion gives us the following extract from Hunain’s ‘Translation of\r\nHippocrates’ (Hunain ex verbo Hippocratis): “Elecampane drives away anger\r\nand sorrow, strengthens the mouth of the stomach, clears the chest,\r\nexpels the superfluities in the veins by the menses and urine, and more\r\nespecially a wine made from it.” (De Simpl. 138.) In fact, as we ought\r\nperhaps to have mentioned, the helenium is a Hippocratic herb. (Nat.\r\nMul. 572, ed. Foës.) It was also well known to Celsus (v, 11 et alibi.)\r\nThe elecampane still retains its place in our Dispensatory and also in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia (p. 76.) The other species described by\r\nDioscorides as the Egyptian elecampane, and which he recommends solely\r\nas being alexipharmic, is held by Sprengel to be the _Teucrium Marum_.\r\nParkinson, however, supported by high authority, seems to make out a\r\nstrong case for the _Cistus Helianthemum_, or rock rose (p. 655.) Old\r\nGerard, on the other hand, adopts the opinion of those commentators who\r\nreferred it to the _Marum_. (p. 67.) The _Teucrium Marum_ also holds a\r\nplace in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλεοσέλινον,\r\n\r\nApium palustre, _Marsh Parsley_; being formed in wet places, it has the\r\nsame properties as the cultivated parsley, and is larger than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The smallage (_Apium graveolens_) is briefly treated of by\r\nthe other authorities. We need scarcely say that it is still retained in\r\nour Dispensatory. See Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλέφας,\r\n\r\nElephas, _the Elephant_; the parings from its hoof, when applied in a\r\ncataplasm, cure whitlow; and those of the bones and teeth of it, being of\r\na drying and detergent nature, are mixed with similar medicines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides in like manner recommends a cataplasm prepared\r\nwith the shavings from the _elephant’s_ hoofs in cases of paronychia.\r\nMost of the other authorities would appear not to have treated of it.\r\nIvory shavings were retained in the Dispensatory until late years. See\r\nQuincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nἙλκυσματα τοῦ ἀργύρου,\r\n\r\nRecrementum argenti, _the Dross of Silver_, has the same powers as the\r\nmolybdæna, for it is astringent and epispastic, hence it is mixed with\r\nthe plasters called Fusca and Epulotic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. What the _Scoriæ argenti_ are will be readily understood\r\nfrom the following description of the process of extracting silver from\r\nthe ores of it: “These ores are extremely hard, and also mixed with\r\nbituminous, sulphureous, arsenical, or vitriolic substances, which carry\r\noff with them a considerable part of the silver, or burn it to _scoriæ_\r\nalong with themselves.” Geoffroy, &c. (p. 272, Engl. ed.) Our author\r\ncopies almost verbatim from Dioscorides, and the other Greek authorities\r\nsupply nothing additional under this head. Aëtius treats of the _scoriæ_\r\nin general terms, as we shall see in the proper place, and merely says\r\nof the _Scoriæ argenti_ that they are possessed of desiccative powers.\r\nOf the Arabians, Avicenna, in treating of this article, borrows every\r\nword from the Greeks. (ii, 2, 693.) Serapion quotes an Arabian authority,\r\nAdamasti, to the effect that the scoria argenti is of use in cardiac\r\ndisease (c. 415.) Rhases, after quoting from Galen, Dioscorides, and\r\nPaulus, gives the opinions of two Arabian authorities, Damas (?) and\r\nChuz, the former to the effect that it is useful in palpitation of the\r\nheart and fetor of the mouth, and the other, that it cures scabies and\r\npruritus. (Cont. l. ult. i, 74.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλλέβορος,\r\n\r\nHelleborus, _Hellebore_; both kinds are calefacient and desiccative in\r\nthe third degree. It (the white) is also acrid and detergent; and hence\r\nit agrees with leprous affections of the skin. The black, when introduced\r\ninto fistulæ, makes the callus cast off in three days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Those who wish to see the general literature of this\r\ninteresting article may find our opinions briefly stated under the\r\nproper head in the Appendix to Dunbar’s ‘Lexicon.’ In this place it\r\nwill be sufficient to mention that we have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe Helleborus albus of the ancients was identical with our _Veratrum\r\nalbum_. Hippocrates makes mention of both species; when he simply uses\r\nthe term helleborus, he means the white, as in Aphor. v, 1, and iv, 15,\r\n16. He also recommends the _niger_ as well as the _albus_ in melancholy\r\nand quartans (Epist. 1288, ed. Foës.) Aretæus, at the conclusion of his\r\nwork, as it has come down to us, pronounces a strong eulogy on hellebore,\r\nwhich he calls the great remedy in cases of elephantiasis. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as an emetic, emmenagogue, and sternutatory. (iv, 148-9.)\r\nMesue and Serapion mention it as an emetic, but concur with Hippocrates\r\nin stating that it sometimes induces convulsions if administered\r\nunguardedly. Haly Abbas gives exactly the same account of it. Averrhoes\r\nmentions that in his time the _Lapis lazuli_ was used as a purgative in\r\nplace of hellebore. (v, 42.) Rhases concurs with the Greek authorities\r\nin praising its effects for the cure of epilepsy, melancholy, arthritis,\r\nand mania. Macer Floridus praises it in the cure of epilepsy, mania,\r\nquartans, &c. We would now beg to be allowed to depart from our general\r\nrule, and to quote some modern opinions in illustration of the ancient\r\non this important subject,—the more important from hellebore forming, as\r\nis supposed, one of the ingredients in the celebrated patent medicine\r\n_eau médicinale_. Conrad Gesner, an upright and learned physician, as\r\nBergius calls him, had great confidence in the white hellebore, which\r\nhe took himself, and administered freely to his patients with great\r\nsuccess. He says of it, “recreat et roborat, et hilariorem facit, et\r\nacuit ingenium, quod in me et aliis sæpissime expertus scribo. Ego, si\r\nvixero, in ellebori historiâ multa proferam quæ medici admirentur.” The\r\nfollowing is his formula for preparing it: ℞ Hell. alb. dr. ij, vini\r\ncretici oz. vj, stent in maceratione, per mensem, additis, si placet,\r\naromatibus. Of this preparation, from 6 to 9 scr. were given according\r\nto circumstances. Baglivi calls hellebore the “Hercules remediorum,\r\npluriumque domitor incurabilium morborum.” Platearius, treating of\r\nhellebore, says that the ancients used it as a purge, in like manner\r\nas scammony is now used, for that men’s bodies, in former times, were\r\nstronger than now; such a medicine would require to be given with great\r\ncaution. He says of it, that it purges phlegm and black bile. The\r\nwhite, he adds, is a more violent medicine than the black. (De Simplici\r\nMedicina.) For a great many years past, with the exception of the partial\r\nadministration of the _eau médicinale_ in cases of gout, the internal\r\nuse of the veratrum may be said to have been quite lost in the practice\r\nof medicine, and that, not only in this country, but also in the land\r\nof Hippocrates and Dioscorides. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is\r\ndirected to be kept as a poison. (p. 76.) Mesue, Serapion, and many of\r\nthe authorities recommend the black hellebore in melancholy. That it was\r\neither the _Helleborus niger_, or the species _orientalis_, Tournefort,\r\nand not the _Veratrum album_ which was commonly administered in Anticyra,\r\nin cases of mania and melancholy, is clearly proved from Dioscorides (iv,\r\n149.) He further states of it that, applied _per vaginam_, it procures\r\nmenstruation, and kills the fœtus; he recommends it for the cure of\r\nscabies, alphos, lichen, and leprosy; he also speaks favorably of it as\r\nan external application to fistulæ, dropsies, toothache, and diseases\r\nof the ears. Galen recommends both species equally in nearly the same\r\nclass of complaints. Notwithstanding the high authority of Pereira, who\r\nmaintains the contrary, we do not see the least reason to doubt that\r\nthe _black hellebore_ of the ancients was our _Helleborus niger_, or\r\nChristmas rose. See Gerard (Paradisus, p. 386) and Parkinson (p. 211.)\r\nWithout doubt it was introduced into this country by the Romans for\r\ntheir _H. niger_. The _H. officinalis_, Salisb., which Dr. Sibthorp\r\nbrings forward in its place, is a distinct species. See Alston’s Lectures\r\n(42); also the Greek Pharmacopœia, Athens, 1837, (p. 77.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘλίχρυσον,\r\n\r\nElichrysum, _Shrubby Everlasting_ or _Eternal Flower_ (called also\r\nChrysanthemon and Amarantum), is a plant used for garlands, having\r\ncapillary leaves of a golden appearance. When drunk with wine it is\r\nsuitable for dysuria, the bites of reptiles, ischiatic disease, and\r\nfractures. It also promotes menstruation, and dissolves coagula when\r\ndrunk with wine and honey, and relieves catarrhs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Linnæus makes the ancient Helichrysum identical with his\r\n_Gnaphalium_. (Gener. Plant. 946.) Accordingly Sprengel, in his R. H. H.,\r\nrefers it, with Cordus and Sibthorp, to the _Gnaphalium Stæchas_. But in\r\nhis edition of Dioscorides he rather inclines to the _Tanacetum annuum_.\r\nDr. Hill says of the tansy: “It has been greatly celebrated as an\r\nuterine, a vulnerary, and a diuretic. It is recommended in suppressions\r\nof the menses, and in cases of the gravel, and other nephritic\r\ncomplaints.” This agrees so well with the characters of the elechrysus as\r\ngiven by Dioscorides and Paulus, that we are inclined to identify this\r\narticle with the _Tanacetum annuum_. It is proper to admit, however, that\r\nthe virtues which Dioscorides ascribes to the elechrysus are ascribed by\r\nold Gerard to the cudweed. It is one of those articles in the ancient\r\nMateria Medica which can never be satisfactorily determined. See further,\r\nParkinson (p. 695) and Lewis’s Dispensatory (i, 411.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἙλξίνη,\r\n\r\nHelxine, or Parietaria, _Pellitory of the Wall_ (called also Perdicium,\r\nParthenium, Sideritis, and Heraclea); its powers are detergent and\r\nslightly astringent, with a coldish humidity. The Helxine, called also\r\nCissampelos, is possessed of discutient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is evidently the second species of Dioscorides (iv,\r\n86), who represents the leaves as being cooling and astringent, and\r\nconsequently proving a suitable cataplasm in cases of erysipelas,\r\nburning, and other inflammations, and as proving useful in chronic\r\ncoughs, inflammations of the tonsils, and so forth. That this plant\r\nis the pellitory of the wall (_Parietaria officinalis_) has been long\r\npretty generally acknowledged. See Parkinson, Gerard, and Sprengel.\r\nGalen ascribes the same medicinal virtues to it as Dioscorides; and\r\nAëtius and Oribasius treat of it in nearly the same terms. It is the\r\nmuralis of Celsus, who recommends the juice of it, added to ceruse, as\r\nan application to the gout. (iv, 24.) It may be proper to mention that\r\nDioscorides (l. c.), Pliny (H. N. xxii, 19), and Apuleius (81), also\r\nrecommend it as an application in cases of gout. The Arabians give the\r\npellitory exactly the same characters as the Greeks do. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 335) and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 536.) The Arabians call it herba\r\nvitri, because glass vessels were cleaned with it. It is now excluded\r\nfrom the Dispensatory, but held a place in it down to a late date. See\r\nQuincy, Hill, and Rutty. That the former species of helxine described\r\nby Dioscorides was a species of _Convolvulus_ has long been known. See\r\nMatthiolus and Parkinson. Dodonæus makes it the _niger_, and Sprengel\r\nthe _arvensis_. Dioscorides briefly states of its medicinal virtues,\r\nthat it is laxative. (iv, 39.) It is not treated of, as far as we have\r\ndiscovered, by Galen, Aëtius, or Oribasius. The Arabians treat of it as a\r\nspecies of _Volubilis_, by the name of _acfin_. See Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n41); Mesue (De Simpl. 24.) Both agree with Dioscorides in making it to be\r\nlaxative. See further APP.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜλυμος ἤ Μελίνη,\r\n\r\nPanicum, _Panic_, is, like millet, desiccative and refrigerant in its\r\npowers when applied externally. It also dries up alvine fluxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Panic, as Miller remarks, is a plant of the millet kind.\r\nIt is the _Panicum Italicum_. It is more an article of food than of\r\nmedicine. We have treated of it accordingly in the part of this work\r\ndevoted to Dietetics. See Vol. I, 124.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜμπετρον ἤ Πρασσοδὲς,\r\n\r\nEmpetron, _Black-berried Heath_, is a medicine which purges phlegm and\r\nbile. It is also saltish and therefore, detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is not well determined whether it be a species of\r\n_Crithmum_, _Herniaria_, or _Salsola_. Dioscorides makes it to be a\r\npurger of phlegm, bile, and water; and all the other authorities, both\r\nGreek and Arabian, give it the same characters in the main. It does not\r\nappear that the Arabians have noticed it; neither do we find it in the\r\nworks of Hippocrates or Celsus. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is\r\nset down as being the _Pimpinella Saxifraga_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘπίθυμον,\r\n\r\nEpithymum (vel Cuscuta minor?) _Dodder of Thyme_, is desiccant and\r\ncalefacient in the third degree, being more drastic than thyme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of the _Cuscuta Epithymus_, or lesser dodder\r\nof thyme, that it purges phlegm and black bile, and agrees particularly\r\nwith melancholic and flatulent cases. (iv, 176.) Aëtius, likewise, calls\r\nit a melanogogue medicine. Galen and Oribasius give exactly the same\r\ncharacter of it as our author. Serapion gives a most graphic description\r\nof this singular parasitic plant, in the present instance quoting solely\r\nfrom Arabian authorities. They agree in general that it is deobstruent,\r\ncathartic, and emmenagogue, and join in recommending it particularly in\r\njaundice, obstructions of the liver and spleen, and in the fevers of\r\nchildren. (De Simpl. 39.) Mesue, also, gives nearly the same characters\r\nof it; he mentions of it that it is a weak and slow purge, unless taken\r\nin a large dose, and, therefore, he recommends it to be given with\r\nIndian myrobalans, black hellebore, mulse, salts, or the like. (16.)\r\nSee also Avicenna (ii, 2, 226) and Rhases (Cont. 270.) It held a place\r\nin our Dispensatory, with the character of being a cleanser, down to a\r\nlate period. See Rutty (Materia Medica, p. 80.); Quincy (Complete Engl.\r\nDispens. p. 117.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘπιμήδιον,\r\n\r\nEpimedium, _Barren Wort_; its powers are moderately refrigerant, with a\r\nwatery humidity. When applied in the form of a cataplasm it preserves\r\nthe breasts in a right state. It is also said to prevent conception when\r\ntaken in a draught.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author borrows his description of the Epimedium Alpinum,\r\nor Barren Wort, from Dioscorides; and none of the others supply any\r\nadditional information respecting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘπιμηλὶς,\r\n\r\nEpimelis, _Crab-tree_, called also Unedo by the Italian husbandmen. It\r\nis a sort of wild apple, the fruit of which, being sour, is bad for the\r\nstomach, and occasions headache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears, from Dioscorides (i, 170), that it is a species\r\nof Medlar. Probably, then, it was the _Mespilus Germanica_. Dioscorides,\r\nGalen, and all the other authorities that treat of it give it the same\r\ncharacter as our author. As a medicine, it has the same characters as the\r\nother Medlars.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘπιπακτὶς,\r\n\r\nEpipactis (called also Helleborine, or _Bastard Hellebore_), is drunk as\r\nan antidote for deadly poisons, and for diseases of the liver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The older herbalists, supported by the authority of\r\nAnguillara, incline to refer this article to the genus _Herniaria_, or\r\nRupture Wort. The epipactis, it would seem, is still in great repute\r\nthroughout Greece, as being alexipharmic, and curing complaints of the\r\nliver. Our author and all the others who notice it take its medicinal\r\ncharacters from Dioscorides. (iv, 107.) As far as we have been able\r\nto discover, it is not noticed by Hippocrates, Celsus, nor any of the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘρέβίνθος,\r\n\r\nCicer, _Vetch_ or _Chick-pea_, a common kind of pulse; is flatulent,\r\nnutritious, a proper medicine for the bowels, diuretic, engenders milk\r\nand semen, and proves emmenagogue. The kind called Arietinum is more\r\ndiuretic than the others. A decoction of them, more especially the black\r\nsort, breaks down stones in the kidneys. The species called Ervinum, is\r\nhotter than the others, and bitterish. The wild are in every respect\r\nstronger than the cultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It comprehends several species of the Cicer. The κριὸς is\r\nundoubtedly the _Cicer arietanum_. The two other species cannot be\r\nso readily determined. Probably they are but varieties produced by\r\ncultivation. We have treated of them among the articles of food, in the\r\n79th section of the First Book. As a medicine, Dioscorides recommends\r\nthem especially in a cataplasm for inflammations of the testicles,\r\nscabies, achor, lichen, cancerous and ill-conditioned ulcers. All kinds\r\nof vetches, he says, are diuretic, and prove useful when given with\r\nrosemary, for jaundice and dropsy. (ii, 126.) Galen gives the chiches the\r\nsame character, and further holds them to be lithontriptic. (De Simpl.\r\nv.) Aëtius follows him closely. (i.) The Arabians in addition say that\r\nchiches are anthelminthic, diuretic, and purgative, and that they are\r\nuseful in arthritic diseases. See Serapion (80); Avicenna (ii, 2, 128);\r\nand Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 209.) Avicenna, in particular, gives a long\r\nlist of their medicinal virtues. In addition to those already stated, he\r\njoins Hippocrates in holding chiches to be aphrodisiacal; and hence he\r\nsays procreating animals, such as camels, are fed with them. He joins\r\nthe others in holding them to be deobstruent, lithontriptic, cathartic,\r\nand diuretic. Chiches long held a place in our Dispensatory with the\r\ncharacters given to them by Dioscorides and Avicenna. See Quincy (111)\r\nand Rutty (122.) Three sorts were used in modern as in ancient times,\r\nnamely, the white, the red, and the black, but, as Quincy remarks, their\r\nmedicinal virtues are all pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜρια,\r\n\r\nLana, _Wool_; that which is unscoured is useful for embrocations, for the\r\nŒsypum is digestive, like butter. That which is scoured is simply the\r\nvehicle for other applications. That which is burnt has acrid, hot, and\r\ndesiccative powers, with some tenuity of parts so as to melt down the\r\nflaccid flesh of ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, Galen, Serapion, and the other authorities give\r\nnearly the same account of the medicinal properties of wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘρίκη,\r\n\r\nErica, _Heath_, is possessed of discutient powers without pungency. Its\r\nflower and leaves are principally to be used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel and Schneider agree that it is the _Erica arborea_,\r\nbut the description of it given by Dioscorides, namely, that “it is like\r\nthe tamarisk but much smaller,” would rather seem to apply to one of the\r\nlesser species. Dioscorides commends it as an application to the bites of\r\nreptiles. (i, 116.) Our author copies from Galen. The Arabians, with the\r\nexception of Ebn Baithar, would appear not to have treated of it, and it\r\nhas not held a place in our Dispensatory for a long time past. The old\r\nherbalists, copying from the ancient authorities, ascribe to the heath\r\nthe virtues which Dioscorides and Galen held it to be possessed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜρινος,\r\n\r\nErinos, _Water-basil_, is an aquatic herb, two drachms of the fruit of\r\nwhich with four drachms of honey, when rubbed in stops defluxions of the\r\neyes. Its juice is also a remedy for earache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it is a species of _Campanula_ has been long agreed\r\nupon. Columna held it to be the _C. Rapunculus_ or _Rampions_, but\r\nSprengel names it _C. Erinus_. It is the _echinos_ of Galen, as is\r\nobvious from the similarity of the descriptions of the two articles.\r\nFew of the other authorities notice it. Our author merely abridges\r\nDioscorides (iv, 29.) The rapunculus or rampion is still cultivated as a\r\nsalad. See Loudon (Encycl. of Garden. 734.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἙρμοδάκτυλος,\r\n\r\nHermodactylus, _Hermodactyl_; the root of it is possessed of purgative\r\nproperties, and also the decoction. It is given for affections of the\r\njoints in rheumatism, but it is bad for the stomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We cannot afford room here to discuss fully the much agitated\r\nquestion respecting the ancient hermodactylus, and beg to refer to what\r\nwe have said on the subject in the Appendix to Dunbar’s Lexicon. See\r\nalso particularly the commentators on Mesue and Dioscorides. It is to\r\nbe remarked that our author has entirely omitted to notice the Κολχικὸν\r\nof Dioscorides by name, and that the only article which he has in place\r\nof it is the Ἑρμ. This is a presumptive proof of the identity of these\r\ntwo medicines. Serapion moreover, in his chapter on Hermodactylus, gives\r\nthe words of our author in this place along with Dioscorides’s account\r\nof the colchicum. Accordingly, Bergius, Tournefort, Humelbergius, and\r\nGeoffroy are decidedly of opinion that they were identical. Prosper\r\nAlpinus, in like manner, says of it “hermodactylus qui est radix colchici\r\nGræcorum.” (De Med. Meth. iii, 9.) See also Hill’s Mat. Med. On this\r\nside of the question we further beg to quote the authority of Dr. Paris:\r\n“The active ingredient of the _Eau médicinale_ has been discovered to\r\nbe the _Colchicum Autumnale_ or meadow-saffron; upon investigating the\r\nproperties of this medicine, it was observed that similar effects in the\r\ncure of the gout were ascribed to a certain plant called hermodactylus\r\nby Oribasius and Aëtius (Paulus _Æg._?), but more particularly by\r\nAlexander of Tralles, a physician of Asia Minor, in the fourth century;\r\nan inquiry was accordingly instituted after this unknown plant, and upon\r\nprocuring a specimen of it from Constantinople it was actually found to\r\nbe a species of colchicum.” (Pharmacologia, 58.) We have already given\r\na full account of the administration of hermodactylus in gout. (Book\r\nIII, 78.) Alexander of Tralles, as far as we know, is the earliest\r\nauthority that treats of the hermodactylus by name, and he recommends\r\nit for the cure of arthritic diseases. (xi.) Our author is the only\r\none of the Greek writers who admits it into the Materia Medica. The\r\nArabians treat of it fully, but some of them confusedly, by mixing up the\r\nancient descriptions of the _ephemeron_ and _colchicum_ with it. Thus\r\nSerapion, after quoting, as already stated, Dioscorides’s account of\r\nthe _colchicum_, gives the opinions of various Arabian authorities, all\r\nof whom concur in representing it to be a calefacient herb, and most of\r\nthem in recommending it in diseases of the joints. (De Simpl. 194.) Mesue\r\nrecommends it as a phlegmagogue in diseases of the joints, when given\r\ninternally with cumin, ginger, pepper, myrobalans, &c.; and externally in\r\nthe form of a cataplasm. He also states it to be a good application to\r\nfoul ulcers. (De Simpl. vii.) Avicenna quotes no Greek authority in his\r\nchapter on Hermodactylus but Paulus, from which it may be inferred that\r\nhe did not identify it with the colchicum of Dioscorides, like Serapion.\r\nHe recommends it especially in gout, both internally and in the form of\r\nplaster. (ii, 2, 343.) Rhases refers to no other Greek authorities on\r\nthis head except Paulus and Alexander, but quotes the opinions of several\r\nArabians, all of whom agree in recommending hermodactylus in gout and\r\nfoul ulcers. An anonymous authority makes it to be aphrodisiac. (Cont.\r\nl. ult. 362.) See also Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 43.) It is particularly to\r\nbe remarked that the Arabian authorities all notice three varieties of\r\nthe hermodactyl root, the white, the red, and the black; and restrict the\r\nmedicinal use of the H. to the first of these, and condemn the two others\r\nas being deleterious. Nicholaus Myrepsus (i, 1) and Actuarius (De Compos.\r\nMed. i), however, prescribe also the red, which the learned Fuchsius, in\r\nhis annotations on the former, sets down as being the _behen rubrum_.\r\nWe know not what are his grounds for this opinion. It is the white\r\nvariety which has been always used medicinally. See Boerhaave, Quincy,\r\nand Pereira. We would beg particularly to refer our readers who wish to\r\nobtain the modern literature of this subject, to the Materia Medica of\r\nPereira (p. 949.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἝρπυλλος,\r\n\r\nSerpyllum, _Wild Thyme_, is heating, so as to promote the urinary and\r\nmenstrual discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All agree that the _Thymus Serpyllum_ is possessed of\r\ndiuretic and emmenagogue powers. Dioscorides recommends it in tormina,\r\nconvulsions, &c., and as an alexipharmic. The others, like our author,\r\ntreat more briefly of it in general terms. Serapion and Avicenna borrow\r\nfreely from Dioscorides. The _Serpyllum_ held a place in our Dispensatory\r\nwith its ancient characters down to a very recent date. See Quincy and\r\nRutty (Mat. Med.) The latter, however, questions its identity with the\r\nancient _Serpyllum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘρυθρόδανον,\r\n\r\nErythrodanum, _Madder_, is the Rubia Tinctorum. Being sour and bitter, it\r\npurges the spleen, liver, and kidneys, so as to occasion a discharge of\r\nbloody urine. It acts as an emmenagogue, and cleanses the sordes of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems scarcely any reason to hesitate in admitting\r\nit to be the _Rubia Tinctorum_, madder and dyer’s madder. Dioscorides\r\nholds it to be powerfully diuretic, insomuch as sometimes to occasion\r\na discharge of blood in the urine. He recommends it in sciatica and\r\nparalysis; as an alexipharmic medicine, and as producing abortion,\r\nmenstruation, and the lochial discharge when applied as a pessary. He\r\nadds, that it cures alphos (mild leprosy) in a cataplasm with vinegar.\r\n(iii, 150.) Our author borrows from Galen, who sets it down as being\r\ndeobstruent, diuretic, and emmenagogue. Aëtius uses nearly the same words\r\nas our author in treating of it. All the Arabians follow the Greeks in\r\ngiving madder the character of being diuretic and deobstruent when given\r\ninternally, and emmenagogue and alexipharmic when applied externally.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 573), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 590.) The Arabian\r\nwriters mention that a bread was sometimes prepared from madder in times\r\nof famine. (Casiri, Bibl. Arab. Hisp., 336.) It is still sometimes given\r\nas an emmenagogue, notwithstanding that Dodonæus questioned the truth\r\nof Dioscorides’s opinion as to its possessing the powers of occasioning\r\nbloody urine and a discharge of the menses. (De Purgant. 97.) Our old\r\nherbalists, Parkinson and Gerard, dispute whether Dioscorides or Dodonæus\r\nis to be followed in this instance. The _Rubia Tinctorum_ holds a place\r\nin the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘρύσιμον,\r\n\r\nErysimum, _Hedge-mustard_; its seed is fiery and heating, equally as\r\ncresses. Wherefore, when boiled in leaven and added to linctuses, it\r\npurges the chest. It also softens indurations, and in the form of a\r\ncataplasm is of use for latent cancers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We may pretty confidently set it down as the _Erysimum\r\nofficinale_, Hedge-mustard. Our author abridges Galen, who, in the\r\npresent case, borrows almost everything from Dioscorides. Aëtius copies\r\nfrom Galen even more closely than our author. The Arabians, in like\r\nmanner, borrow everything from Dioscorides and Galen under this head.\r\nSee in particular Serapion (De Simpl. 357.) It is worthy of remark that\r\nDr. Hill gives the same medicinal character to the hedge-mustard which\r\nDioscorides gives to the _Erysimon_, which it will be admitted forms a\r\nstrong presumption of their identity; at all events, they were evidently\r\ncongeners, a fact which is not disputed by those who question their\r\nidentity. See Rutty (Mat. Med.) and Sprengel (ad Dioscor.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΕὔζωμον,\r\n\r\nEruca, _Rocket_, being also like it in temperament, is flatulent. It\r\ntherefore produces venereal incitement, and the seed of it is diuretic.\r\nThe wild is stronger than the cultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Brassica Eruca_,\r\nL. Dioscorides agrees with our author in setting it down as being\r\naphrodisiacal and diuretic, and Aëtius does the same. The latter proposes\r\nto correct its tendency to induce headache by giving it with lettuce.\r\n(ii, 169.) Celsus ranks the “eruca” among the things “quæ contrahere\r\nsemen videntur.” (iv, 21.) The Arabians agreed with the Greeks as to its\r\naphrodisiacal properties. (Casiri, Bibl. Arab. Hisp. i, 336.) See also\r\nSerapion (224), Avicenna (ii, 2, 227.) Even down to a late date rocket\r\nretained this character. See Rutty (183), and Quincy (109.) It is still\r\ncultivated in gardens. See Loudon (Encycl. &c. 744.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘυπατώριον,\r\n\r\nEupatorium, _Hemp-agrimony_, consists of subtile particles, and is\r\npossessed of incisive powers without manifest heat. Hence it clears away\r\nobstructions of the liver, and has also some astringency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the _Eupatorium_ of Dioscorides and the other Greek\r\nauthorities is the _Agrimonia Eupatorium_, will hardly be questioned now\r\nby any competent judge who has investigated the question. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends its leaves in ill-conditioned ulcers, and its seed and stalk\r\nin wine, for dysentery and the stings of reptiles. (iv, 41.) Galen makes\r\nit to be deobstruent and tonic. Serapion copies from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen, and merely adds, in the end, from Rhases, that southernwood is\r\nmore suitable in complaints of the liver; and from Mesue, that it is good\r\nin protracted fevers. (De Simpl. 77.) Avicenna’s chapter on Eupatorium\r\nis entirely compiled from Dioscorides, Galen, and Serapion, without the\r\nslightest change or addition. (ii, 2, 239.) No one who has examined into\r\nthe matter can therefore doubt that the Eu. of these two Arabians, was\r\nthe same as that of the Greeks. The Eupatorium of Mesue, however, has\r\nbeen generally held to be a very different plant, namely, the _Eupatorium\r\nCannabinum_, according to some, from his comparing the leaves to\r\nthose of the lesser centaury. It is to be borne in mind, however, that\r\nthe Latin translations of the Arabians are not to be trusted in small\r\nmatters, and therefore this comparison may be all a mistake. And that the\r\nEu. of Mesue was the same as that of the others, seems highly probable\r\nfrom his recommending it in the same complaints, namely, in obstructions\r\nof the liver, and chronic fevers. (De Simpl. 15.) Such is the conclusion\r\nto which an impartial examination of the question has brought us. It is\r\nbut fair to mention, however, that all the old herbalists and writers on\r\nthe Mat. Med. down to Rutty and Quincy, are against us, and hold that the\r\nEupatorium of Mesue was different from that of the Greeks. See Matthiolus\r\n(in Dioscor.); Parkinson (Theatre of Plants); and the commentators on\r\nMesue.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘυφόρβιον,\r\n\r\nEuphorbium, is possessed of caustic powers, and consists of subtile\r\nparticles like the other juices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. A gum-resin produced from some species of _Euphorbia_\r\nstill holds its place in the Materia Medica. Alston remarks, “neither\r\nDioscorides nor Galen take any notice of the cathartic quality of the\r\nEuphorbium, but Pliny does, as do also Aëtius, Paulus, and the Arabians;\r\nbut all make it excessively acrid, upon account of which its internal use\r\nis now generally condemned.” Mesue particularly commends it in diseases\r\nof the joints. It was formerly supposed that Euphorbium is procured from\r\na species called the _E. antiquorum_, but it is now admitted that the\r\nspecies is still undetermined. See Pereira (1127.) Probably, as stated in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia, it is procured from several species of the\r\nEuphorbia. (66.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἘφήμερον,\r\n\r\nEphemerum (or Colchicum Autumnale?), not the poisonous species but\r\nthat which is called the Wild Iris. It is possessed of mixed powers,\r\nrepellent, and discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Ἑρμοδάκτυλος, and Book V (48.) The E., here said to be\r\nthe same as the wild iris, is the _Convallaria verticillata_. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends its root in toothache, and its leaves as possessing\r\ndiscutient powers when applied to swellings and tumours. (iv, 75.) Galen\r\nis at great pains to explain its _modus operandi_ agreeably to his theory\r\nof the action of medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nἘχίδνα,\r\n\r\nVipera, _the Viper_; its flesh is decidedly hot and dry in temperament,\r\nso that it cleanses the whole body by the skin. Wherefore many persons\r\naffected with elephantiasis, by eating or drinking of it have been cured.\r\nThose which live by the sea-side, or in other dry situations, rather\r\noccasion thirst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. As stated by us in the Fifth Book, the Echidna Asiatica of\r\nNicander is the _Coluber Ægyptius_, and the E. Europæa the _C. Berus_.\r\nThe ἔχις, probably is the _C. Amodytes_. Dioscorides recommends vipers,\r\nhaving their head and tail cut off, and the entrails taken out, boiled\r\nwith oil, wine, a little salts and dill, for nervous affections and\r\nscrofula. He gives no credit, however, to the vulgar belief of his time,\r\nthat living upon vipers prolonged life, or that they prevented lice from\r\nforming on the body. He describes distinctly the process of preparing\r\nsalts from vipers, but says they have not the same efficacy as the flesh.\r\n(ii, 18.) The Arabians display much more credulity than Dioscorides, in\r\ndescribing the medicinal virtues of vipers, ascribing to them wonderful\r\npowers, not only of preserving life, but even of restoring youth. See in\r\nparticular, Avicenna (ii, 2, 608), and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 731.)\r\nGalen gives a very lengthened disquisition on the medicinal virtues\r\nof vipers. (De Simpl. xi.) Aëtius abridges the same. (ii, 160.) See\r\nOribasius (Med. Collect. xv, 2.) We shall have occasion, however, to\r\ntreat further of the medicinal properties of the viper when describing\r\nthe composition of the theriac; and, instead of collecting the sentiments\r\nof the ancient authorities on this head, we shall in this place merely\r\nsubjoin the opinion of a modern author, who appears to have been familiar\r\nwith the use of it: “The powder of vipers is very much enlivened with the\r\nvolatile salt wherewith the vipers abound, which enables it to force its\r\nvirtues through the pores, though never so close shut, to the more remote\r\nparts of the body. It is a singular medicine to cure scabs, itches, and\r\nerysipelas, and particularly the leprosy. It restores plumpness of\r\nbody to persons wasted with long agues and tedious diseases. It is to\r\nbe taken fasting, in broths, wine, or any other cordial liquor, or else\r\nincorporated with some syrup, or in some confection like a bolus.” (Moses\r\nCharras.) In Scotland the adder (which is a variety of the _Coluber\r\nBerus_) is a popular remedy for malignant diseases of the skin. It is\r\ntaken in the form of soup, as described by Dioscorides. The viper broth\r\nis described in Quince’s Dispensatory (400) in nearly the same terms as\r\nby Dioscorides, and recommended “as doing good service in leprous and\r\nother obstinate cutaneous complaints.”\r\n\r\n\r\nἘχίνος,\r\n\r\nEchinus; the herb is austere, repellent, and desiccant. Of the Land\r\nEchinus, or _Hedgehog_, the flesh when strongly dried is discutient\r\nand desiccant; when taken in a draught, therefore, it is beneficial in\r\nelephantiasis, cachexia, and many other complaints. Its skin, when burnt,\r\nbecomes more desiccant and discutient. It therefore cures alopecia when\r\nrubbed in with liquid pitch. Of the Sea Echinus, the edible part is\r\ndiuretic, and agrees with the bowels. Its shell, when burnt, resembles\r\nthat of the land echinus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The herb is not described by Dioscorides, Theophrastus, or\r\nPliny. It would appear to be the same as the _Erinus_, which see. The\r\nἘ. χερσᾶιος is undoubtedly the _Hystrix Cristata_, and the Ἐ. θαλάττιος\r\nthe _Echinus Esculentus_. Dioscorides and Galen give the same account\r\nof their medicinal properties as our author. Serapion, after giving the\r\ndescription by Dioscorides and Galen, adds, from an Arabian authority,\r\nthat the flesh of the land echinus is beneficial in protracted fevers.\r\n(De Simpl. 435.) Avicenna (ii, 2, 234,) treats of the two echini at\r\ngreater length than any other ancient author, recommending the flesh of\r\nthe land, in phthisis, dropsy, elephantia, scabies, scrofula, and other\r\ncomplaints of a formidable nature. Upon the whole, however, his account\r\nof it is mostly made up of extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. See in\r\nlike manner Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 273.) He recommends the land echinus\r\nin the irretention of urine to which children are subject, adding that\r\nwhen frequently administered, it brings on dysuria. He and Avicenna quote\r\nSerapion as an authority for its use in protracted fevers. Both the\r\nechini disappeared from our Dispensatory a considerable time ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nἜχιον,\r\n\r\nEchium, _Viper’s Bugloss_, (some call it also _Dorias_, and others\r\n_Alcibiadium_,) is a prickly herb, which not only relieves those who have\r\nbeen bitten by reptiles when drunk in wine, but, if taken beforehand, it\r\npreserves them from being injured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to us quite clear that this article is the _Echium\r\nvulgare_ or Viper’s Bugloss, which we have no doubt was introduced\r\ninto Britain with other medicinal herbs by the Romans, for it is never\r\nfound remote from cultivated places, and therefore we believe it not to\r\nbe truly indigenous. Some have taken it for the _Echium rubrum_, from\r\nDioscorides having described the flowers as being _purplish_, whereas,\r\npurplish signifies a bright blue, and not red as is supposed. Parkinson\r\nthus describes the colour of the flowers of the _Echium vulgare_:\r\n“The flowers are of a purplish violet colour, in them that are fully\r\nblown, but more reddish while they are in bud; but in some places of\r\na paler purple colour,” &c. (p. 413.) We, then, have no hesitation in\r\nacknowledging it as the _Echium vulgare_. Our author borrows his account\r\nof its medicinal powers from Dioscorides. (iv, 27.) The Arabians would\r\nseem to confound it with the Anchusæ, to which it is closely allied. Our\r\nold herbalists, in treating of the viper’s bugloss, follow Dioscorides;\r\nbut it has long ceased to hold a place in our Dispensatory. It still,\r\nhowever, is known in the shops, where its root retains the character of\r\nbeing aperient and slightly astringent. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. p.\r\n54.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἝψημα ἢ σίραιον,\r\n\r\nDefrutum, _Boiled Must_; it is moderately heating and digestive, and is\r\nalso emplastic and free from pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny gives the following account of it: “Siræum quod alii\r\nhepsema, nostri sapam appellant, ingenii, non naturæ opus est, musto\r\nusque ad tertiam partem mensuræ decocto: quod ubi factum ad dimidiam\r\nest, defrutum vocamus.” (H. N. xiv, 11.) Harduin states that the Hepsema\r\nis called _Rob_ or _Sapa semplex_. (l. c.) Moses Charras gives the\r\nfollowing directions for preparing it: “℞. Of the new juice of white\r\ngrapes perfectly ripe, lb. xxx; boil it over a gentle fire in an earthen\r\nglazed vessel, or a copper vessel tinned within, until a third part of\r\nthe juice only remains. But if you desire a _defrutum_, boil it only to\r\nthe consumption of the third part.” (Roy. Phar. p. 70.) The following\r\nprescription, taken from a still later writer, will further be useful\r\nin illustrating the meaning of a term which often occurs in the course\r\nof this work, but which has now fallen into disuse. “The Simple Rob\r\nor Sapa. Take of juice newly expressed from generous and white grapes\r\nany quantity, and boil it over a slow fire, until one pint of it only\r\nremains out of three, or it becomes of a honey consistence.” Quincy’s\r\nDispensatory (432.) Few of the other authorities treat of this article at\r\nall, and those that do, despatch their notice of it in few words. Thus,\r\nfor example, Avicenna says of rob, that it is expectorant, and hence it\r\nis made an ingredient in the syrup of poppies; and that it is useful in\r\npain of the kidneys and bladder. (ii, 2, 570.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΖέια,\r\n\r\nFar, _Spelt_, has powers like the kinds of wheat, holding an intermediate\r\nplace as to heating and cooling; it is also gently desiccative and\r\nemplastic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This, as we have explained elsewhere (Vol. I, 123), is the\r\n_Triticum Spelta_, to which our older herbalists give the names Greek\r\nWheat, Spelt Wheat, or Spelt Corn. That the _Zeia_ of the Greeks was\r\nidentical with the _Far_ of the Romans, is proved beyond all dispute from\r\na passage of Asclepiades preserved by Galen. (De Locis Affectis, ix.) The\r\nterm _spelta_ is derived from the latino-barbarous translations of the\r\nArabians. See Serapion (122), who quotes under this head the chapter of\r\nDioscorides on _tragus_, which was spelt deprived of its hull. The other\r\nauthorities say little of spelt as a medicine; but commend it highly as\r\nan article of food. (See Vol. I, l. c.) Avicenna describes it by the name\r\nof _harcoman_ (ii, 2, 323); and Rhases by that of _haratinam_ (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 352.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΖιγγιβὲρ,\r\n\r\nZingiber, _Ginger_; its root is powerfully heating, but not on its first\r\napplication, as it contains some crude and thick juice, on which account\r\nit readily becomes carious, but it preserves the heat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt the _Amomum Zingiber_. Dioscorides after\r\ndescribing the country of the ginger, and the characters of the best\r\nkinds of it, states its medicinal powers to be heating, digestive, mildly\r\naperient of the bowels, and stomachic; and recommends it in nebulæ of\r\nthe cornea, and adds of it, that as an ingredient in antidotes and\r\notherwise it resembles pepper (ii, 189.) Galen writes very elaborately\r\nin explanation of the action of ginger on the animal frame; and, in\r\naccounting for the difference between it and pepper and other articles of\r\nthe same class practically, his conclusions regarding it are the same as\r\nour author’s. Aëtius and Oribasius copy from him. Serapion, after quoting\r\nthe opinions of Dioscorides and Galen, gives a very sensible account of\r\nthe virtues of ginger from Mesue and another unknown authority. Mesue\r\nsays it is beneficial in obstructions of the liver, arising from coldness\r\nand humidity; that it softens the belly, heats the stomach and the whole\r\nbody; promotes digestion; is alexipharmic and aphrodisiacal; removes\r\nphlegm (water brash?) and is beneficial in obscurity of vision. The\r\nunknown authority says it improves the memory, and removes the humidity\r\nin the stomach, arising from the eating of fruit, such as melons and the\r\nlike (De Simpl. 336.) In the works of Mesue, now extant, ginger is not\r\ntreated of. Rhases gives very interesting extracts from Dioscorides,\r\nGalen, and various Arabian authors. Of the latter, one says of ginger,\r\nthat it softens the belly, and another that it binds it. (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 762.) Avicenna quotes Dioscorides as stating that it is aperient, and\r\nAlcanzi as holding that it is astringent. He agrees with the latter, that\r\nginger binds the bowels, when their loose state arises from indigestion\r\nand viscid humours. He agrees also with the other authorities, that it is\r\nstomachic and aphrodisiac. (ii, 2, 735.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΖύθος,\r\n\r\nZythus, _Ale_, is of a compound nature; for it is acrid, as being formed\r\nby a putrefaction (“fermentation?”), and cold, as being possessed of an\r\nacid quality. It therefore produces bad chyle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The plan of our present work prohibits us from entering\r\ninto an exposition of the general literature of this subject, but we\r\nthink this the less necessary as in another work, to which we have often\r\nreferred in this part of our Commentary, we have given an elaborate\r\ndisquisition on the ancient Ales, into which we have condensed all the\r\ninformation which we could procure respecting them. We would also beg\r\nleave to refer to Gruner’s learned annotations on Zozimus Panopolita (De\r\nZythorum Compositione); to Ludovicus Nonnius (De re Cibaria, iv, 15);\r\nEustathius (Comment. in Iliad. xiii, 640); and Athenæus (Deipnos. x, 67,\r\ned. Schweigh.) Our proper business now is to state the opinions of the\r\nmedical authorities with regard to their medicinal powers. Dioscorides\r\nmentions two kinds of ale or beer, in his Mat. Med., both of them\r\nprepared from barley, but does not state wherein the difference between\r\nthem consisted. The Zythus, he says, is diuretic, apt to affect the\r\nkidneys and nerves; peculiarly calculated to prove prejudicial to the\r\nmembranes of the brain; is flatulent; engenders depraved humours, and\r\noccasions elephantiasis. Of the Courmi, he also says, that it occasions\r\nheadache, forms bad humours, and is hurtful to the nerves; he adds,\r\nthat drinks of this nature are also formed from wheat, in Spain and\r\nBritain (ii, 109, 110.) See further, Pliny (H. N. xxii, 82.) Aëtius,\r\nOribasius, and our author, copy almost verbatim from Galen. Rhases\r\ntreats of the Zythus, by the name of _foca_, first quoting the chapter\r\nof Dioscorides on the Zythus, and then adding, upon the authority of\r\nan Arabian writer, Bimasuy (Mesue the elder?), that ale prepared from\r\nbarley, cloves, and rue, is prejudicial to the head; but that prepared\r\nfrom fine bread (similago?) mint, and parsley, forms good chyle, and\r\nis good for the stomach (Cont. l. ult. i, 306.) Avicenna’s account of\r\nZythus, which he also describes by the name of _foca_, is entirely made\r\nup of extracts from Dioscorides and Rhases. (ii, 2, 272.) Serapion, as\r\nfar as we can discover, does not treat of this article. A liquor is\r\ntreated of pretty copiously by Symeon Seth, under the head of _Fucas_,\r\nwhich, as his editors remark, is probably a corruption of Posca. In his\r\naccount of it, he introduces a short sentence from Dioscorides’s chapter\r\non Zythus, to the effect that “ivory steeped in it becomes as ductile\r\nas wax.” It was not, strictly speaking, an ale or beer, being merely\r\na mixture of vinegar and water, rendered more agreeable to the palate\r\nby some aromatics. See Harduin ad Plinii (H. N. xix, 29.) Respecting\r\nthis beverage Seth states, as his own opinion, that it is wholesome,\r\nespecially when used by persons of a hot temperature of stomach; that it\r\nquenches thirst; whets the appetite; increases the alvine and frequently\r\nthe renal discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\nΖύμη,\r\n\r\nFermentum, _Leaven_; it also is composed of opposite ingredients; for it\r\nis possessed of a cold acidity and putrefactive (“fermentative?”) heat,\r\nand moreover of salts and flour. It is, therefore, heating and discutient\r\nin no ordinary degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On the ancient modes of preparing Fermentum or Leaven,\r\nsee ‘Geopon.’ (ii, 31); and Pliny (H. N. xviii, 26.) The kind in most\r\ncommon use was prepared from millet and must, or the fresh juice of the\r\ngrape. Our author’s description of its medicinal powers is taken from\r\nGalen. Aëtius treats of it in nearly the same words. Dioscorides praises\r\nthe leaven of wheat as being heating and epispastic, and suiting with\r\ncomplaints of the heels, phymata, and furunculi. (ii, 107.) Serapion\r\nunder this head gives two extracts from Dioscorides and Galen, followed\r\nby one from Abenmesuai (the elder Mesue?), who recommends it in the\r\nfevers of children for quenching thirst. (De Simpl. 29.) Rhases gives a\r\nformula for a draught to be prepared from leaven, which he in like manner\r\npraises as being wonderfully efficacious in the fevers of children.\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 306.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΖωμὸς,\r\n\r\nJusculum, _Broth_, loosens the belly if drunk by itself or with wine,\r\nwhen made from fresh fish; but particularly that which is simply prepared\r\nfrom hakes, scorpion-fishes, rainbows, perches, and other tender fishes\r\nwhich dwell among rocks, with water, oil, dill, and salts. In like\r\nmanner, also, the broth of the Crustacea, especially of the Tellinæ\r\n(limpets), the Chamæ (cockles), and Conchylæ (oysters). The broth of an\r\nold cock, boiled with salt to a great degree, is laxative; but that of a\r\nhen, on the other hand, is astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The account here given of the broth of fishes is taken from\r\nDioscorides (ii, 35.) Galen directs the broth of fish to be prepared in\r\nthe following manner: first pour in plenty of water, then add of oil _q.\r\ns._ with a little dill and leek; then, when the fish are half boiled,\r\nsprinkle a little salt. (De Alim. Facult. iii); (Meth. Med. ix.) Apicius\r\nin the tenth chapter of his work, gives fourteen different receipts for\r\npreparing soups from fishes. Most of them contain wine, honey, vinegar,\r\nand oil, with pepper, lovage, cumin, rue, &c., among the ingredients\r\nwhich enter into their composition. On the fishes mentioned under this\r\nhead, see Book I (90.) The Arabians generally condense the substance of\r\nDioscorides’s two chapters on Garum and Jus into one, under the title\r\nof _Muria_. See Serapion (184), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 486.) Serapion’s\r\nArabian authorities recommend it as a gentle purgative and phlegmagogue\r\nin sciatica, both when given by the mouth and in clysters. One of them\r\nsays of it, that it makes the pustules of smallpox come out, when the\r\neruption is slow in taking place.\r\n\r\n\r\nἩδύσμον,\r\n\r\nMentha, _Mint_, is hot, consists of subtile particles; its powers are\r\nacrid in the third order, with some half-concocted fluids; it therefore\r\nprovokes to venery. It has, likewise, some bitterness, by which means\r\nit kills intestinal worms; and by its sourness its restrains recent\r\ndischarges of blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We need have no hesitation in referring it with all the\r\nbest commentators to the _Mentha sativa_, L. Dioscorides says it has\r\ncalefacient, astringent, and desiccative powers; and hence, he adds,\r\nit stops the discharge of blood when drunk with vinegar, and kills\r\nthe round worms. (iii, 36.) According to him, it stimulates the male\r\nto venery, but prevents conception in the female when applied on a\r\npessary before coition. He further says of it, that it stops hiccup,\r\nvomiting, and cholera, when taken in a draught along with the juice of\r\nan acid pomegranate. He also recommends it, in the form of an external\r\napplication, for headache, complaints of the breast, and other cases.\r\nGalen pronounces mint to be one of the most attenuate articles in the\r\nMat. Med. He agrees with Dioscorides that it is useful in hæmoptysis; and\r\nthat it is anthelminthic and aphrodisiac. The author of the Hippocratic\r\ntreatise ‘_De Diætâ_,’ while, like Dioscorides, he gives mint the\r\ncredit of promoting the urinary discharge and stopping vomiting, says,\r\nthat taken in great quantity it weakens the semen and stops erections.\r\nAristotle likewise holds the opinion that mint is anaphrodisiac. (Bibl.\r\nii, 20.) Aëtius, seemingly with the desire of reconciling these great\r\nauthorities, maintains that mint indeed generates much semen, but of a\r\nfeeble nature. (Tetr. iv, 4, 26.) Ludovicus Nonnius, by the way, also\r\nattempts to account for the difference among the professional authorities\r\non this point. (De re Cib. i, 15.) See also Rutty, (Mat. Med. 323), and\r\nParkinson (35.) The Arabians in treating of it follow Dioscorides and\r\nGalen closely, and add little or nothing of their own. They all agree\r\nwith Dioscorides, that it is aphrodisiac and stops vomiting. See in\r\nparticular Serapion (290), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 188.) We need scarcely\r\nmention that this species of _Mentha_ is now rejected from our Mat. Med.,\r\nbut that three other species of it are still retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nἩδύσαρον ἢ Πελέκινος,\r\n\r\nHedysarum, _French Honeysuckle_, is bitter and subastringent. It is\r\ntherefore stomachic, when taken in a liquid form, and clears away\r\nvisceral obstructions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There has been great difference of opinion among the\r\ncommentators and herbalists respecting this herb; but we are inclined to\r\ndecide, with considerable confidence, that it was the Hatchet Vetch, or\r\n_Coronilla securidaca_. Dioscorides says of it that it is stomachic and\r\nalexipharmic, and that, in a pessary, it prevents conception. Our author\r\nabridges Galen, and Aëtius does the same; and so likewise Oribasius. We\r\nhave been unable to find it in the Mat. Med. of the Arabians, with the\r\nexception of Ebn Baithar, who merely copies from Dioscorides (i, 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἩλιοτρόπιον,\r\n\r\nHeliotropium, _Sunflower_; the large one (called also Scorpiurus) is\r\npossessed of calefacient, desiccant, and detergent powers. Its decoction\r\nwhen drunk brings away phlegm and bile. Its fruit in a cataplasm dries\r\nmyrmecia and such like cutaneous complaints. The small Sunflower also\r\nremoves these complaints and kills worms if drunk with the fruit along\r\nwith natron, hyssop, and cardamom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides calls the great Sunflower (_Heliotropium\r\nEuropæum_) phlegmagogue and cholagogue, and says it is useful in the\r\nbites of scorpions, both internally and externally. He adds, that it\r\nwas used as an amulet to produce sterility. He also recommends it in\r\nintermittent fevers, and as a cataplasm and fomentation to various\r\ntumours, sprains, &c. He adds, that it is emmenagogue, and procures\r\nabortion when powdered and applied on a pessary. (iv, 190.) None of the\r\nother Greek authorities, as far as we have been able to discover, have\r\ntreated of either of the heliotropes; and if the Arabians describe them,\r\nwe have not been able to discover under what name it is. The lesser\r\nheliotrope is probably the _Croton tinctorius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἬλεκτρον,\r\n\r\nElectrum, _Amber_; they say that it is the tears of the poplar, which are\r\ndischarged into the river Po, and get concreted into a golden-coloured\r\nsubstance. This, being pulverized and drunk, stops defluxions of the\r\nstomach and bowels and discharges of blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is well known that the ancient authors in general\r\nrepresent amber as an exudation from the poplar tree, commonly found\r\non the banks of the Po. Some of them, however, such as Lucian (De\r\nElectro), held that it is a bituminous substance. See also Theophrastus\r\n(De Lapidibus, with the annotations of Hill.) Serapion says of it,\r\nthat it is formed in the sea as mushrooms are formed on land; and when\r\nthe sea is troubled it casts forth large stones, and with them are\r\ncast out crusts of amber. He also gives an account, which is not very\r\nintelligible in the Latin translation, of its being swallowed up by a\r\nfish, from which, when killed, amber was procured. What is of a citrine\r\ncolour, he says, is good; but what is white, like an ostrich’s egg, is\r\nbad. Upon the authority of Aben Mesuai (Mesue the elder?), he calls\r\nit a hot and dry medicine, and says it strengthens the brain, all the\r\nsenses, and the heart, and is useful to old persons and men of a cold\r\ntemperament. (De Simpl. 196.) Avicenna’s account of it is mostly made\r\nup from Serapion. Amber, he says, in my opinion, is an emanation from a\r\nfountain in the sea. He also repeats the account from Serapion, of its\r\nbeing procured from the belly of a fish which has swallowed it and dies.\r\nHe must allude to the ambergris which is procured from the sperm-whale.\r\nHe determines it to be hot in the second and dry in the first degree. He\r\nrecommends it in exactly the same cases as Serapion. He makes mention\r\nof a species used for dyeing the hair black. (ii, 2, 62, and 364.)\r\nRhases merely gives its medicinal character, which is the same as that\r\nquoted above from Serapion. (Cont. l. ult. 44.) But no ancient writer\r\nhas given so full and correct an account of amber as Symeon Seth. He\r\nsays it abounds in various places, and that there are fountains of it\r\nas of pitch, bitumen, and the like; that the best kind is of a grayish\r\ncolour (grisea ambra?) and fat, which is sold in a certain city of India,\r\ncalled Silachetum. The ambergris or ambra-grisea, is found in a city of\r\nArabia Felix, called Syachria. The worst kind, he says, is black, and\r\nis collected from fishes that have swallowed amber at its fountains. It\r\nhas, he adds, calefacient and incisive powers, and therefore some add\r\nit to stomachic remedies. It strengthens the head and heart; and when\r\nsmelled to in drinking accelerates intoxication, and still more so if\r\nadded to the wine. (De Alimentis, xiii.) Psellus says, it cures dysury\r\nwhen appended as an amulet, removes fever, stops defluxions of the\r\nstomach, and sharpens the sight. (De Lapidibus.) Having been led along in\r\nthe present instance by the ancient authorities who have given the most\r\ncorrect description of amber, we omitted to mention at the commencement,\r\nthat Dioscorides describes the electrum under the head of populus, as\r\nbeing said to be the tears of poplars which have dropped into the Po, and\r\nbecome coagulated. He adds, it is of a fragrant smell when rubbed, and\r\nof a golden colour; and when triturated and drunk, it stops defluxions\r\nof the stomach and belly. (i, 110.) See also Pliny (H. N. xxxvii, 11),\r\nwho supposes amber an exudation from pines, and gives otherwise a very\r\nauthentic and interesting account of its origin. He makes mention of\r\namber being used as an amulet in diseases of children, a practice which,\r\nlike other superstitions of the like kind, has been transmitted to modern\r\ntimes. We need scarcely remark that the ancient opinions regarding the\r\norigin of amber, are now looked upon as being not far removed from the\r\ntruth. Amber, although now in a fossil state, is supposed to have been an\r\nexudation from some tree of the genus Pinus. See Pereira (Mat. Med. 223);\r\nand the Appendix to this section.\r\n\r\n\r\nἩμεροκαλλὶς,\r\n\r\nHemerocallis, _Lily of the Valley_; its root has powers like those of the\r\nlily, and, like it, is useful for burns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is undoubtedly a plant of the lily tribe; probably the\r\n_Lilium bulbiferum_. Dioscorides, besides recommending it in burns,\r\nlike our author, says of it that when drunk and applied in a pessary\r\nof wool it produces discharges of water and blood; and that its leaves\r\nform an excellent application to the inflammations of the breasts after\r\nparturition, and to those of the eyes. Our author follows Galen. Serapion\r\ntreats of it under the head of Lilium. (189.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἩμιονίτις,\r\n\r\nHemionitis, _Moon Fern_, is possessed at the same time of astringency and\r\nbitterness. It therefore relieves affections of the spleen when taken\r\nwith vinegar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen calls it also by the names of _Scolopendrium_ and\r\n_Asplenium_. (ii, 292, ed. Basil.) Dioscorides describes it so as to\r\nleave no doubt of its being a cryptogamous plant. It is a species of the\r\n_Scolopendrium_. The other authorities praise it in enlarged spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\nἯπαρ,\r\n\r\nHepar, _the Liver_; if that of a mad dog be roasted and eaten, it is said\r\nto relieve those who have been bitten by him. The sanies of a boiled\r\ngoat’s liver relieves nyctalopia when injected into the eye. They also\r\ndirect the vapour of it when boiling to be received into the eyes, and\r\nalso to be eaten. They say that it rests epileptics if eaten, and that\r\nthe liver of the buck-goat does the same. The liver of a lizard when\r\nput into carious teeth relieves the pain. That of the wolf is added to\r\nthe hepatic medicine prepared from eupatorium. The liver of an ass when\r\nroasted is of use to epileptics when eaten fasting. That of a bear when\r\ndried in its fresh state and triturated with wine is drunk for the\r\nbites of reptiles. The liver of the cormorant, when dried and taken in a\r\ndraught, makes calculi be discharged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the livers of animals in the dietetical\r\npart of the First Book. See also in particular Galen and Serapion. Our\r\nauthor copies from the former, who in his turn follows closely in the\r\nfootsteps of Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nἨριγέρων,\r\n\r\nSenecio, _Groundsel_, has mixed powers, being refrigerant and moderately\r\ndiscutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides recommends it (_Senecio vulgaris_) in\r\ninflammatory complaints, and also says of it that when drunk with must\r\nit relieves the pains of the stomach proceeding from bile. Galen and\r\nthe other authorities, like Paulus, treat of it in general terms as an\r\nantiphlogistic application. Apuleius recommends it in sciatica (75, 5.)\r\nIn modern times it had the character of being emetic, but the ancient\r\nauthorities do not say that it has this property.\r\n\r\n\r\nἨρύγγιον,\r\n\r\nEryngium, _Eryngo_, is calefacient in no imperceptible degree, and has no\r\nlittle heat and subtility of parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it is a species of _Eryngium_ or sea holly seems\r\nindisputable. It may either be the _maritimum_, the _planum_, or the\r\n_campestre_, all of which are brought into view and figured by our\r\ncareful herbalist Parkinson. (Theatre of Plants, 986.) Dioscorides’s\r\ndescription of its localities would seem to agree best with the\r\n_campestre_; he calls it calefacient, and says it is diuretic and\r\nemmenagogue, removing tormina and flatulences, and proving serviceable in\r\nhepatic diseases, and as an alexipharmic. He adds, that it is related of\r\nit that it discusses hard tumours, both when appended as an amulet and in\r\na cataplasm; and that the root of it cures opisthotonos and epilepsy when\r\ndrunk with hydromel. (iii, 21.) Galen and the other Greek authorities\r\ntreat of it in general terms like Paulus. The _secacul_ of the Arabians\r\nhas been taken for this article, but erroneously, as Matthiolus has well\r\nremarked. (Ad Dioscor. iii, 21.) But Serapion treats of it under the\r\nname of _Iringi_, as being a white variety of the Aster Atticus. He\r\nmerely translates the words of Dioscorides and Galen. (De Simpl. 96.) We\r\ncannot find any mention of it in the works of the other Arabians, except\r\nEbn Baithar, who also does little more than copy from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. The eryngo long retained its place in our Dispensatory, indeed\r\nit can scarcely be said to be yet formally expelled from it. Pereira\r\nbriefly notices the _Eryngium campestre_. It is the _Eryngium maritimum_,\r\nhowever, which is described in the Edinburgh Mat. Med. Quincy, by the\r\nway, in imitation of Serapion, confounds the Eryngo with the Aster\r\nAtticus. (Complete Engl. Disp. 113.) Boerhaave gave the candied root and\r\ndecoction of eryngo as an attenuant and deobstruent in obstructions of\r\nthe viscera, and for coughs; and Tournefort makes mention of the same as\r\nbeing in common use in his days. (Mat. Med. 98. Engl. edition.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘάλάσσιον ὕδωρ,\r\n\r\nAqua Marina, _Sea Water_, is acrid, moderately calefacient, and\r\ndesiccant; it is bad for the stomach when taken in a draught, disorders\r\nthe bowels, and proves phlegmagogue. If poured hot on a part it attracts\r\nand discusses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient authorities who have written most learnedly on\r\nthis important, although common-place article of the Mat. Med., are\r\nDioscorides, Avicenna, and Rhases. Sea water, says Dioscorides, is\r\nheating, acrid, and bad for the stomach, for it disorders the belly,\r\nbringing away phlegm and bile. When poured hot on a part it attracts and\r\ndiscusses, suiting with affections of the nerves and chilblains before\r\nthey become ulcerated. It is proper for mixing with raw barley-meal, and\r\nis suitable for plasters and discutient malagmata. For evacuating the\r\nbowels it is injected in a tepid state, and for tormina in a hot. It is\r\na suitable fomentation in cases of scabies, pruritus, lichen, enlarged\r\ntonsils, and turgid mammæ. In hot fomentations it dispels lividities,\r\nand is useful in the bites of venomous animals, such at least as induce\r\ntremblings and rigors, but especially of scorpions, phalangia, and asps,\r\nand if, in such cases, one go into a hot bath, it proves useful; and\r\nin chronic cachexiæ of the body and nerves the bath of it is useful.\r\nIts hot vapours soothe dropsies, headaches, and dullness of hearing.\r\nIt is given as a purge either alone or with oxycrate, wine, or honey;\r\nand after the purging takes place the broth of a hen or of fishes is\r\nexhibited to dilute its acrimony and pungency. (v, 19.) Avicenna borrows\r\nlargely from Dioscorides, but supplies some additional remarks of his own\r\nby no means devoid of interest and importance. He recommends sea water\r\nfor chilblains, for killing lice, and discussing extravasated blood.\r\nHe also, copying from Dioscorides, praises it in pruritus, scabies,\r\nand impetigo. Epileptics, he says, are benefited by tepid salt water,\r\nbut injured by hot. The vapour of salt water, he adds, is beneficial\r\nin vertigo and dropsies. (ii, 2, 58.) From Rhases’s very lengthened\r\ndissertation on this subject we can only find room for a few extracts.\r\nUpon the authority of Johannitius (Serapion?), he states that the use\r\nof salt water to one unaccustomed to it proves laxative and pinches the\r\nbelly, but to one accustomed to it, it proves astringent. Another of his\r\nauthorities, Judæus, says salt water proves beneficial in pain of the\r\nhead and chest, in dropsy, and a watery stomach. He also states of salt\r\nwater, that although at first it proves laxative, the continued use of it\r\nbrings on constipation, because, he says, its salt dries, astringes, and\r\nstrengthens the belly. (Cont. l. ult. i, 70.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘαλίκτρον,\r\n\r\nThalictrum, _Meadow Rue_, has desiccant powers, without pungency. It\r\ntherefore heals chronic ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel confidently pronounces it to be the _Thalictrum\r\nminus_, L., that is to say, the lesser meadow rue of our herbalists. See\r\nParkinson (265.) Dioscorides and Galen state its medicinal properties in\r\nthe same terms as our author. It is the Thalitruum of Pliny, who likewise\r\npraises it as an application to ulcers. (H. N. xxvii, 112.) We have not\r\nbeen able to find it described by any of the Arabian authorities on the\r\nMat. Med. except Ebn Baithar, and it has had no place in our English\r\nDispensatory for many ages past.\r\n\r\n\r\nΘαψία,\r\n\r\nThapsia, _Deadly Carrot_, is acrid and strongly calefacient, with some\r\nhumidity. It therefore attracts strongly the deep-seated fluids, and\r\ndispels them when attracted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The authorities are divided between the _Thapsia Garganica_\r\nand the _Thapsia Asclepium_. Old Gerard gives it the name of deadly\r\ncarrot, but Parkinson that of scorching fennel. Theophrastus mentions\r\nthat it purges upwards and downwards. (P. ix, 10, 24.) Pliny describes\r\nit as a very acrid poison. (H. N. xxiii, 43.) See Dioscorides (iv, 154.)\r\nSerapion states that it is a violent emetic and cathartic, and operates\r\npowerfully as an external application. The thapsia has long ceased to\r\nbe employed in medicine; even old Culpeper calls it “a venomous foreign\r\nroot, and therefore no more of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nΘεῖον,\r\n\r\n_Sulphur_; it likewise is possessed of attractive powers, is hot, and\r\nconsists of subtile particles, so as to be an antidote against many\r\npoisonous animals, more especially the sea-turtle and dragon, either\r\nsprinkled dry or mixed with saliva, or with the urine of a child, or oil,\r\nor honey. It is also a wonderful remedy for scabious complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sulphur was extensively used in medicine from the earliest\r\ntimes. Pliny gives a very full and interesting account of it. (H. N.\r\nxxxv, 50.) The sulphur vivum, of which mention is so often made in this\r\nwork, was evidently native sulphur, that is to say, the prismatic sulphur\r\nof Jameson. The sulphur ignem expertum was clearly the factitious sulphur\r\nor brimstone, namely, that which is procured from pyrites by sublimation.\r\nWe need scarcely mention that sulphur was extensively used as an\r\napplication in cutaneous diseases, and more especially scabies. It was\r\nalso given internally in catarrhs and other complaints of the chest. See\r\nDioscorides and Pliny. The words of the latter are well worth quoting in\r\nthe present instance. “Natura ejus calfacit, concoquit, sed et discutit\r\ncollectiones corporum: ob hoc talibus emplastris malagmatisque miscetur.\r\nRenibus quoque et lumbis in dolore cum adipe mire prodest impositum.\r\nAufert et lichenas a facie cum terebinthi resina et lepras. Harpacticon\r\nvocatur a celeritate avellendi, avelli enim subinde debet. Prodest\r\net suspiriosis linctum. Purulenta quoque extussientibus, et contra\r\nscorpionum ictus. Vitiligines vivum nitro mixtum atque ex aceto tritum\r\net illitum tollit, item lendes in palpebris, aceto sandarachato admixto.”\r\nWe have not found the acetum sandarachatum mentioned by any other writer;\r\nfrom its name, it was no doubt composed of vinegar and arsenic, that\r\nis to say, realgar. Serapion, in treating of sulphur, confines himself\r\nentirely to Greek authorities (407); and so in like manner Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 612), and Rhases (Cont. ult. 694.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘέρμος,\r\n\r\nLupinus, _Lupine_; that which is edible is possessed of emplastic powers;\r\nbut the bitter is detergent, discutient, and desiccative, without\r\npungency. It kills worms, both when applied externally and when taken in\r\ninfusion, and it cleanses the bowels when drunk with rue and pepper. It\r\nalso cleanses the skin, and discusses tumours when applied with oxymel.\r\nThe wild is more bitter and stronger than the cultivated in all respects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Two varieties of the lupine, the _sativus_ and _sylvestris_,\r\nwere used in medicine from the days of Dioscorides down to our Quincy.\r\nThough the former of these, which was the one principally used, be\r\nwell known, there is some doubt as to the species; whether it was the\r\n_pilosus_, or the _hirsutus_, or, what is more probable, whether it\r\ncomprehended both. Dioscorides and Galen agree in enumerating a long list\r\nof cases to which the lupine is applicable, but as our author’s account\r\nembraces the sum of what they have written on it, we need not enter\r\nhere into an exposition of their opinions. Suffice it to say, that as\r\nan emmenagogue and deobstruent it was much relied upon internally, and\r\napplied in a great variety of external complaints in fomentations. The\r\nsame virtues are ascribed to it by the Arabians, who, however, supply\r\nno additional observations of any importance. Avicenna’s account of its\r\nmedicinal powers is particularly full. (ii, 2, 440.) Rhases derives\r\nalmost all his information from the Greeks. (Cont. l. ult. i, 435.)\r\nSerapion copies altogether from Dioscorides and Galen (De Simpl. 74.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘηλύπτερον,\r\n\r\nWhich some call Nymphæa or Filix, _Female Fern_, is like the fern in all\r\nits properties. When drunk with wine it kills the broad and round worms.\r\nIt also destroys the fœtus in utero. Its leaves, when eaten, soften the\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems every reason to refer it to the _Asplenium\r\nFilix fœmina_, Bernh., or _Polypodium_, L. Theophrastus recommends it\r\nas a vermifuge medicine. (H. P. ix, 20.) Galen, Avicenna, and all the\r\nauthorities that treat of it, concur in assigning to it this faculty.\r\nDioscorides also sets it down as a medicine calculated to induce\r\nsterility and occasion abortion. The powder of it is recommended as an\r\napplication to ill-conditioned sores. In the days of Quincy it still held\r\nan equivocal place in the Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nΘλάσπι,\r\n\r\nBursa Pastoris, _Shepherd’s Purse_, is possessed of acrid powers, so\r\nthat when drunk it breaks internal abscesses, and occasions a flow of\r\nthe menses; and if injected by the anus it relieves ischiatic disease\r\nby occasioning a bloody discharge. It otherwise purges bile upwards and\r\ndownwards when drunk to the amount of an acetabulum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel holds that the Θ. of Dioscorides is the _Thlaspi\r\nBursa Pastoris_. Dioscorides describes another species, which is either\r\nthe _Iberis umbellata_, or the _Viola latifolia_. Pliny recommends the\r\nThlaspi as a phlegmagogue and cholagogue. (H. N. xxvii, 113.) Dioscorides\r\nassigns it the same character, and also holds that it is emmenagogue. Our\r\nauthor copies closely from Galen. Avicenna dwells at considerable length\r\nupon the virtues of Thlaspi, calling it emetic and purgative, and also\r\nanthelminthic, emmenagogue, and carminative. The _Thlaspi arvense_ held\r\na place in the Dispensatory, with all the characters of the ancient T.,\r\ndown to a late date. See Quincy (Compl. Engl. Dispens. 66.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘρίδαξ,\r\n\r\nLactuca, _Lettuce_, is a juicy and cold potherb, yet not extremely so,\r\nbut of the temperament of spring water. It therefore suits with hot\r\ninflammations, and also quenches thirst. When taken in an infusion it\r\nstops gonorrhœa and libidinous dreams. The wild lettuce is less cooling\r\nand diluent than the other, and is also more juicy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The cultivated kind is certainly the _Lactuca sativa_: the\r\nwild the _L. virosa_. The ancients, as we have stated in another place,\r\nwere well acquainted with the hypnotic powers of lettuce. See Celsus (ii,\r\n32); Dioscorides (ii, 164); Athen. (Deipnos, ii, 80, ed. Schweig.); Pliny\r\n(xix, 38); Galen (De Alim. Facul. ii, 40); Geopon. (xii, 13); Aëtius\r\n(i, 168); Symeon Seth (De Alimentis); Macer Floridus (De Herb. vir.);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. ex Plant.) According to Dioscorides, it is also\r\nanaphrodisiac, and removes the pollutio nocturni somni. One of Serapion’s\r\nArabian authorities commends it in jaundice; and another of them says\r\nthat it dispels the unpleasant effects produced by intoxication. (De\r\nSimpl. 240.) Avicenna’s account of its medicinal virtues is very\r\ninteresting, but is in the main derived from Dioscorides and Galen. He\r\nrepresents it to be an eminently cold, that is to say, a sedative plant,\r\nand recommends it in all complaints of a hot nature, in watchfulness,\r\nalienation of mind, and in _coup de soleil_. He also speaks highly of its\r\nmilk in hot affections of the eyes. (ii, 2, 441.) Rhases likewise gives\r\nan excellent description of its powers, but in nearly the same terms as\r\nAvicenna. He makes it to be soporific, anaphrodisiac, and alexipharmic.\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 386.) Dioscorides states that the wild lettuce is a\r\nhydragogue purgative, and we may mention that the late Dr. Collin, of\r\nVienna, gave it with great success in dropsies. Avicenna says the wild,\r\nin virtue, resembles the black poppy. We need scarcely say that both\r\nthe _L. sativa_ and _virosa_ have, of late years, been restored to the\r\nMateria Medica. Upon reference to the works of Orfila, Paris, Pereira,\r\nand other authorities of the day, it will be seen that the ancients had\r\ncorrectly stated the medicinal virtues of both species.\r\n\r\n\r\nΘύμος,\r\n\r\nThymus, _Thyme_, heats and dries in the third degree. It also incides\r\nviscid and thick humours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have little hesitation in describing it to be the _Thymus\r\nvulgaris_. Dioscorides states that thyme is expectorant, diuretic,\r\nemmenagogue, and discutient; and all the authorities, down even to modern\r\ntimes, confirm this character of it. Galen says it is to be placed in the\r\nthird order of desiccants and calefacients. He recommends it as being\r\ndiuretic and emmenagogue, and says that it destroys the fœtus in utero,\r\nclears out the viscera, and is useful in discharges from the chest and\r\nlungs. Oribasius gives it the same character. Aëtius, from personal\r\nexperience, as he says, writes of its virtues more elaborately than any\r\nother ancient author. Thus he gives a prescription for a draught composed\r\nof oxymel and finely powdered thyme, which he says proves beneficial in\r\narthritic diseases by purging bile and the acrid humours, both by the\r\nbelly and by the bladder. He recommends similar compositions in sciatica,\r\npleuritic pains, meteorism of the hypochondria, and tympanitis. He\r\nprescribes, in like manner, thyme and oxymel to melancholic persons, to\r\nthose disordered in mind, and possessed with morbid apprehension; and in\r\ngout, when given with undiluted wine. He also recommends it to be given\r\nin swellings of the testicles, to the patient fasting, in undiluted\r\nwine. The Arabians write fully on this head, but borrow almost all their\r\ninformation from Dioscorides and Galen, and make no reference to Aëtius.\r\nSee in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 328), and Serapion (De Simpl. 281.)\r\nThey all agree in giving it the character of being diuretic, emmenagogue,\r\nanthelminthic, and phlegmagogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nΘύμβρα,\r\n\r\nThymbra, _Savory_; the wild has the same powers as thyme. The garden is\r\nin all respects weaker, but is better for food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancients made use of _Savory_ (_Satureia Thymbra_) as\r\na condiment. Aristophanes (Nubes, 420.) Dioscorides recommends it in\r\nthe same cases as thyme, and all the others write of it in much the\r\nsame terms. Symeon Seth says it promotes digestion, is emmenagogue,\r\ndiaphoretic, and carminative. Macer Floridus affirms that it is\r\naphrodisiacal, and produces abortion in pregnant women when applied on a\r\npessary. It long held a place in the Dispensatory with the character of\r\nbeing “warm and discussive.” See Quincy (127.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΘυμελάια,\r\n\r\nThymelæa, _Spurge-flax_; from it the _Granum Gnidium_ is produced, which\r\nhas similar powers to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The confusion about the Thymelæa and Chamelæa of the ancients\r\nmay be partly removed by the following account of the matter given by\r\nAlston. There are three species of Laureola, 1st, the _L. officinalis_,\r\nor _L. Mas_, _Dwarf Laurel_, or _Spurge Laurel_, which grows in hedges\r\nand woods in England; 2d, the Chamelæa, or _Laureola femina_ namely, the\r\ntrue _Mezereon_, or _Spurge Olive_, which grows plentifully in Germany;\r\n3d, the Thymelæa, _Spurge Flax_, or _Mountain Widow Wail_, which grows in\r\nthe south of France. We will treat further of the Chamelæa, or Mezerion,\r\nin its proper place. Sprengel is decidedly of opinion that the Thymelæa\r\nof the ancients is _Daphne Gnidium_, L., or flax-leaved daphne, and one\r\nof the latest and best authorities on the Mat. Med. comes to the same\r\nconclusion respecting it. Dr. Pereira says, “_Daphne Gnidium_ is the\r\nΘυμελάια, or Thymelæa of Dioscorides, whose fruit is the κόκκος κνίδιος,\r\nor Gnidium berry, used by Hippocrates. Its properties are similar to\r\nthose of the _D. Mezereon_.” (Elements of Mat. Med. 807.) For an account\r\nof its effects on the animal economy, see Orfila (Toxicol. ii, 3.) We\r\nwill treat of its medicinal virtues under _Coccus gnidius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸδαῖα ρίζα,\r\n\r\nIdæa Radix, _Idæan Root_; being sour as to taste and powers, it agrees\r\nwith hemorrhages and rheumatic affections when drunk or applied\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. As may be seen upon referring to Bauhin, Woodville, Sprengel,\r\nand Pereira, several of the authorities have been disposed to hold this\r\nplant for the _Arbutus Uva Ursi_; but the probability is that it was the\r\nLaurus Alexandrina, or _Uvularia amplexifolia_. Dioscorides recommends\r\nit in fluxes from the bowels and womb, and in all kinds of hemorrhage.\r\n(iv, 44.) Pliny translates the chapter of Dioscorides. (H. N. xxvii, 69.)\r\nOur author copies from Galen; and Oribasius, in like manner, borrows\r\nhis description of the plant from him. As far as we can discover the\r\nIdæa Radix is not treated of by the Arabians; and even in the days of\r\nMatthiolus it had disappeared from the Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸδρῶς.\r\n\r\nSudor, _Sweat_; it is troublesome to collect by itself; but is mixed\r\nwith the powder of those who exercise themselves in the palestra, which\r\npowder, being only repellent before, thus becomes altogether discutient.\r\nIt is, therefore, a powerful remedy for inflamed nipples, and for\r\nextinguishing the heat in them. It also answers with buboes; but if too\r\ndry it must be softened with oil of privet or oil of roses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Sweat_, or the matter of Perspiration. “Sweat,” says Galen,\r\n“is one of the fluids formed in the animal body, consisting of the same\r\nmaterials, and having the same mode of formation, as the urine, for both\r\nare formed from the liquids drunk, these being heated, and acquiring\r\nalso some bilious property. But the sweat is more elaborated, as having\r\npassed through so many intervening bodies to the skin.” (De Med. Simpl.\r\nx.) This is a very ingenious account of the nature of the sweat and\r\nurine, which, it is certain, bear a close analogy to one another, and\r\nare often vicarious discharges. Thus, in cases of suppression of urine,\r\nthe perspiration has often an urinous taste and smell. But this is not\r\nthe place for enlarging further upon this subject. Our author’s account\r\nof the medicinal properties of sweat is taken from Galen. (l. c.) All\r\nthe other authorities, in like manner, copy from him. See in particular\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 466), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 648.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἸξὸς,\r\n\r\nViscum, _Birdlime_, is heating with acrimony. It attracts, therefore, the\r\ndeep-seated humours powerfully, and is discutient, like the Thapsia, but\r\nis much more inefficacious than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Viscum, or Birdlime, is got from the _Loranthus\r\nEuropæus_, or Misseltoe. The Viscum quercinum held a place in the Materia\r\nMedica from the earliest times down to a very late date. Dioscorides\r\nmentions that birdlime is also got from the apple tree, the pear tree,\r\nand other trees, and is found upon the roots of certain shrubs. Pliny\r\ndescribes the ordinary mode of preparing it. (H. N. xvi, 94.) Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it principally as an agglutinative and attractive application\r\nto indolent tumours and sores. When mixed with the caustic ley (quicklime\r\nand potass) he says birdlime increases its efficacy. With orpiment and\r\nsandarach, and applied in a cataplasm, it draws off diseased nails.\r\n(iii, 93.) Galen remarks that, like Thapsia, its calefacient powers do\r\nnot come into immediate operation. The other authorities, in treating of\r\nthis substance, follow Dioscorides and Galen. See in particular Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 717), and Ebn Baithar (i, 410.) The Viscum album is retained in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia. (Athens, 1837, 167.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἸὸν,\r\n\r\nViola, _the Violet_; its leaves have a watery and coldish substance for\r\ntheir prevailing ingredient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be little or no doubt that the purple violet of\r\nDioscorides is the _Viola Odorata_. On the violet, see a most interesting\r\ndisquisition by Celsius (Hierobotanicon in voce Dudaim); also Sprengel\r\n(R. H. H.) Dioscorides calls it refrigerant, and recommends it as an\r\nexternal application in ardor of the stomach, inflammation of the eyes,\r\nand prolapsus ani; and mentions, that it had been taken internally in\r\nquinsy and epilepsy of children. (iv, 120.) Galen merely recommends it\r\nexternally in the same cases as Dioscorides. The Arabian authorities\r\nextend the use of this article. Thus, Avicenna recommends it in heat\r\nof the stomach, both internally and externally; in a syrup for coughs,\r\npleurisies, and other affections of the lungs; in pains of the kidneys as\r\na diuretic, and as a cholagogue. (ii, 2, 715.) See also Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. 3, 21), and Ebn Baithar (i, 170.) Serapion, on the authority of Aben\r\nMesuai, says further of it that it is laxative in doses of from three to\r\nseven drachms. (De Simpl. 141.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἸὸς,\r\n\r\nÆrugo, _Verdigris_, has a bitter quality to the taste, being discutient,\r\ncathartic, and corrosive, not only of soft but also of hard flesh; but\r\nby mixing a little of it with much cerate, one may render the medicine\r\ndetergent without pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it was the _Ærugo Æris_, or Verdigris, seems\r\nindisputable. The scraped verdigris (ἰὸς ζυστὸς) was the common kind,\r\nand the name is still retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia (61.)\r\nHippocrates, Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen recommend verdigris in\r\ncomplaints of the eyes. Dioscorides describes very minutely the process\r\nfor preparing verdigris, which is not very unlike that which is now\r\npractised in France. He also makes mention of another species, namely,\r\nthe _Ærugo Scolecia_, with which we are now unacquainted. He gives an\r\ninteresting account of the cases in which it is applicable. (v, 92.)\r\nGalen also writes of it with great precision. He says, when lightly\r\napplied it relieves fungated sores; and when diluted with cerates, it\r\ncleanses them. (De Simpl. ix.) The other Greek authorities give much the\r\nsame account of it. The Arabians treat fully of the two kinds, which\r\nthey call _Ærugo rasilis_ and _subtilis_, but borrow almost all their\r\ninformation from Dioscorides and Galen. Like the Greek authorities,\r\nthey apply it principally in intractable ulcers and in diseases of the\r\neyelids. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 739), and Serapion (De Simpl. 383); Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. ii, 44); Ebn Baithar (i, 540.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἹππόκαμπος,\r\n\r\nHippocampus, is a sea animal, the ashes of which when burnt thicken the\r\nhair in alopecia, along with liquid pitch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is, indisputably, our _Syngnathus Hippocampus_. Ælian\r\nrelates that it has proved useful in cases of hydrophobia. (Hist. Anim.\r\nxiv, 20.) Our author borrows from Dioscorides (ii, 3.) The Arabians do\r\nnot treat of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἹππολάπαθον,\r\n\r\nHippolapathum, _Horse Burdock_, grows in marshes, being like the Burdock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article, which would seem to be the _Rumex\r\nHydrolapathum_, is treated of in the same brief terms by the other\r\nauthorities. See Dioscorides (i, 141.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἹππομάραθρον,\r\n\r\nHippomarathrum, _Horse Fennel_; that variety which resembles the Cachrys\r\nis more desiccant than the common Fennel. It is, therefore, astringent,\r\nlithontriptic, and emmenagogue; but that species which has seed like\r\ncoriander seed, is also like it in other respects, but weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is little doubt that the former species is the _Cachrys\r\nSicula_. The other is undetermined. Our author copies closely from\r\nDioscorides (iii, 76); and the others follow his example. The modern\r\nherbalists, in like manner, borrow from Dioscorides. See Parkinson (884.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἹπποπόταμος,\r\n\r\nHippopotamus, _Sea-horse_; its testicle, when dried and drunk, is a\r\nremedy for the bites of reptiles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This brief notice of the _Hippopotamus amphibius_, or\r\nWater-horse, is taken from Dioscorides (ii, 25.) Most of the other\r\nauthorities have omitted it.\r\n\r\n\r\nἹπποσέλινον,\r\n\r\nHipposelinum, _Horse Parsley_, has properties resembling those of\r\nparsley, but weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Smyrnium Olusatrum_, according to Dierbach,\r\nStackhouse, Sprengel, and all the best authorities. Dioscorides\r\nrepresents it to be emmenagogue and diuretic, and as proving beneficial\r\nin rigors. (iii, 71.) Galen and the others treat of it briefly like our\r\nauthor. The Arabians treat of it under Selinum (_Apium_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἹππουρὶς,\r\n\r\nHippouris, _Horse-tail_, has astringent qualities with bitterness, and\r\non that account it is at the same time powerfully desiccant, without\r\npungency. It is agglutinant, therefore, of the largest wounds, and is\r\nuseful in intestinal hernia, and cures defluxions when drunk with wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The first species of Dioscorides corresponds to our author’s,\r\nand is marked as the _Equisetum Fluviatile_ by Sprengel, which is called\r\nin English the _Horse-tail_. The other is the _E. Limosum_. Apuleius\r\nrecommends it in dysentery and spitting of blood. Aëtius recommends it\r\nin the same complaints. But both, in fact, only borrow from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen, especially the latter, who treats of it more fully than\r\nDioscorides. The Arabians give exactly the same account of the Equisetum;\r\nindeed they profess to borrow everything from Dioscorides and Galen. See\r\nin particular Serapion (137), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 200.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἹπποφαὲς ἤ Ἱπποφαῖος,\r\n\r\nHippophaes, used for scouring clothes. It is a branchy shrub, the root\r\nof which contains juices which are extracted like those of Thapsia. One\r\nobolus of the juice mixed with the flour of tares, purges phlegm and\r\nbile; and the whole plant, when dried, becomes purgative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without entering into the discussion regarding this plant,\r\nwe shall merely observe that we are disposed to agree with those who\r\nrefer it to a species of spurge, namely, _Euphorbia spinosa_. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes it as being cholagogue, hydragogue, and phlegmagogue. (iii,\r\n159.) It does not appear that it is treated of by Galen, nor by the\r\nArabian authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸρίς.\r\n\r\nIris, _Fleur-de-lys_, is calefacient, consists of very subtile particles,\r\nand is detergent and digestive. It therefore agrees with coughs, renders\r\nexpectoration easy, cures tormina, and cleanses foul ulcers. When drunk\r\nwith honeyed water it evacuates the bowels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Probably it comprehends the _Iris Germanica_ and _I.\r\nFlorentina_. It is the first article treated of by Dioscorides, who gives\r\na full account of it, and concludes by saying that the different species\r\nof it are useful for many purposes. He recommends them as an external\r\napplication in cutaneous diseases and ulcers, and as being soporific\r\nand alexipharmic; when drunk with wine as proving emmenagogue, and also\r\napplied in pessaries, malagmata, and acopa. The others treat of its\r\nvirtues less copiously, with the exception of Serapion and Avicenna.\r\nOne of Serapion’s Arabian authorities, Aben Mesuai, says it purges\r\nyellow bile and black bile, and is deobstruent in obstructions of the\r\nliver. He also mentions it as a sternutatory and masticatory. (De Simpl.\r\n189.) Avicenna’s characters of the Iris are in the main derived from\r\nDioscorides, but altogether his description of it is very interesting.\r\nHe recommends it very particularly in diseases of the rectum and uterus,\r\nboth when administered internally and in a hip-bath. He also represents\r\nit as proving useful in gonorrhœa, and in the pollutio nocturni somni.\r\nHe concludes by calling it a general alexipharmic (ii, 2, 349.) The\r\nroot of the Florentine Iris or Flower de Luce, was used in the practice\r\nof medicine down to a late date. See Quincy and Boerhaave. It is still\r\nkept in the shops, and has the character of being a drastic hydragogue.\r\nGray, Suppl. to Pharmacop. (251.) It retains a place in the Modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸσάτις.\r\n\r\nIsatis, _Woad_; the garden species which dyers use, is of a desiccative\r\nnature, having also some astringency. By means of these powers it\r\nagglutinates even the large wounds of hard bodies, is of use in\r\nhemorrhages, discusses œdematous swellings, and opposes the progress of\r\nall malignant diseases. The wild is more pungent, and on that account\r\nbeing more desiccant, it the more strongly resists all humid gangrene,\r\nbut for all other purposes it is worse as being pungent. Owing to its\r\nstrong powers, it is useful in affections of the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dr. Martyn says, “The _Woad_ is called Isatis and Glastum,\r\nand affords a blue tincture.” (Ad Virg. Ec. iv, 43.) See also Miller,\r\nParkinson, and Gerard. It is the _Isatis Tinctoria_. The second species\r\nof Dioscorides, or Sylvestris, is the _Saponaria Vaccaria_, L., but the\r\npassage is probably spurious. Our author’s account of the Isatis is\r\nabridged from Galen, who has an elaborate article under this head. Aëtius\r\ncopies still more closely from Galen. Both these authorities direct\r\nbread or barleymeal to be mixed with its pounded leaves when they are\r\notherwise too strong. Of the Arabians, Avicenna gives the most accurate\r\naccount of it under the head of _Nil_ seu Glastum sativum et sylvestre.\r\nIn its external use he follows Dioscorides and Galen, and joins Rhases in\r\nrecommending it internally as an emetic for the cough of children, ulcers\r\nof the lungs, and pleurisy arising from black bile. He further commends\r\nthe wild species in affections of the spleen. (ii, 2, 505, 290, 299.)\r\nSerapion and Rhases give a confused account of the Isatis, under the head\r\nof Indicum. (De Simpl. 47); (Cont. l. ult. 370.) The Woad held a place\r\nin our Dispensatory down to a recent date. See Quincy (91.) Woad and\r\nindigo were long used together in dyeing, which probably is the reason of\r\nthese two articles being confounded together by certain of the ancient\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸσόπυρον ἢ φυσίολον,\r\n\r\nIsopyrum or Faseolus, (Bog Bean?); its seed is bitter and somewhat sour.\r\nIt is, therefore, detergent, and exudes the thick and viscid humours at\r\nthe same time that it contracts bodies, and is astringent. It therefore\r\npurges deep-seated humours, and is not against persons affected with\r\nvomiting of blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From our author’s account of it, it would seem to be the\r\nsame as the fasil, or kidney-bean; but Dioscorides clearly distinguishes\r\nbetween them. (iv, 119.) Dodonæus had referred it to the _Menyanthes\r\ntrifoliata_, or bog-bean; but this opinion is rejected by Sprengel. He\r\ninclines to the _Corydalis claviculata_, Pers., but is not decided.\r\nWe rather incline to the opinion of Dodonæus, on the ground that its\r\nmedicinal character, as given by Galen and our author, applies very well\r\nto the _Menyanthes trifoliata_. It is not treated of by Aëtius, nor can\r\nwe find it in the Mat. Med. of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸτέα,\r\n\r\nSalix, _the Willow_; the leaves and flower are possessed of desiccant\r\npowers without pungency. It has also some astringency; but the bark is\r\ndrier, and when burnt, the ashes of it are powerfully desiccant, for they\r\nremove clavi and myrmecia with vinegar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Several species of the _Salix_ are described by Theophrastus\r\nand other ancient authors. Milligan refers that of Celsus to _S. alba_,\r\n_fragilis_, and _purpurea_; but to define the species, which are so\r\nnumerous in this genus, is futile. But that the _Alba_ was _one_ of the\r\nmedicinal willows of the ancients, can admit of no doubt. See Parkinson\r\n(1430.) Dioscorides says the fruit and leaves, and bark and juice of the\r\nwillow tree are possessed of an astringent power, and accordingly he\r\nrecommends them both externally and internally in various complaints for\r\nwhich astringents are indicated, such as hæmoptysis, and as a fomentation\r\nin arthritic complaints. He also mentions the ley of it when prepared\r\nwith vinegar for the removal of callus and corns. (i, 35.) Galen also\r\ngives a very elaborate statement of its medicinal virtues; he says it is\r\ndesiccative without pungency, and has some astringency; and he recommends\r\nit strongly in the same cases as Dioscorides and our author; indeed, the\r\nlatter merely abridges Galen. Aëtius copies from Galen almost word for\r\nword. The Arabians treat fully of it; but in the same terms as their\r\nGrecian masters. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 2, 250); Avicenna (ii, 2, 319,\r\n677); Serapion (De Simpl. 136); Ebn Baithar (i, 122.) In the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia both the _Salix fragilis_ and _alba_ stand for the ancient\r\nἰτέα.\r\n\r\n\r\nἸχθυοκόλλα,\r\n\r\nIchthyocolla, _Fish-glue_; its powers are emplastic and desiccant. It\r\nanswers well for the composition of cephalic and agglutinative plasters,\r\nand of those which are prepared for leprosy; also for removing wrinkles\r\nfrom the face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That described by Dioscorides and our author was got from the\r\n_Acipenser Huso_. The large fish described by Herodotus, and Eustathius,\r\nin his commentary on the work of Dionysius the geographer, under the name\r\nof Antacæus, was, most probably, nearly the same as the Huso. See the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia (83.) Artedi makes the _Huso_, _Ichthyocolla_\r\nand _Antacæus_ to be varieties of the species of _Acipenser_, which he\r\ncalls _Acipenser tuberculis carens_. It would appear to be the ὀξυρύγχος\r\nof Ælian. (H. A. xvii, 32.) He makes mention of its gluten or isinglass.\r\nOur author’s account of its medicinal virtues is mostly copied from\r\nDioscorides. The others supply no additional information. The Arabians\r\ntreat of it under the general head of gluten, and recommend it in the\r\nsame cases as the Greeks, quoting Dioscorides, Galen, and Paulus.\r\nSerapion and Rhases recommend it in hæmoptysis. See Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n202); Serapion (c. 138); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 336.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάκανος,\r\n\r\nCacanus; its root is moderately desiccative and not pungent, also\r\nemplastic, and hence it relieves roughness of the windpipe in a linctus\r\nwith wine, and when chewed like tragacanth and liquorice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is not mentioned by Dioscorides, Pliny, Theophrastus,\r\nAëtius, or any other ancient author but Galen and Paulus; nor has any one\r\nof the commentators noticed it. We are unable, therefore, to determine\r\nanything for certain respecting it. But as Dioscorides and Pliny ascribe\r\nnearly the same medicinal powers to the _Cacalia_ as our author does to\r\nthe Cacanus, it seems not improbable that they may have been identical.\r\nOur author evidently borrows from Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάγκαμον,\r\n\r\nCancamum; it is the tear of an Arabian wood, resembling myrrh, fragrant,\r\nand hence used in perfumes. It has the power of extenuating fat bodies,\r\nand is detergent and deobstruent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides treats of it in the portion of his work devoted\r\nto aromatics, calling it the tear of an Arabian wood, having some\r\nresemblance to myrrh, which was used in fumigations with myrrh and\r\nstorax. He calls it emmenagogue; mentions that it is given in asthmatic,\r\nepileptic, and splenetic cases; says it is useful as a cleanser in\r\ndiseases of the eye; but that it is most particularly applicable for\r\nfungous gums and toothache. (i, 23.) Galen has omitted it from his Mat.\r\nMed. Of the Arabians, Avicenna is the authority who has treated of it\r\nmost distinctly. He calls it a gum of a bad taste which is brought from\r\nthe region of the west. (This account of the country which produces it\r\nmay warrant suspicion that he had confounded it with some other gum, the\r\nproduction of Italy or Spain.) He says of it, that some had confounded\r\nit with sandaracha (gum vernix?). In giving its medicinal virtues, he\r\ncopies closely from Dioscorides (ii, 2, 382.) It is doubtful, from this\r\nimperfect description of the Cancamum, what substance it applies to;\r\nprobably either to _Gum anime_ or to _Gum elemi_. There seems no good\r\nground for referring it, as some have done, to _Lacca_; nor to some\r\nnondescript species of the _Amyris Katef_, as Sprengel does. (Ad Dioscor.\r\nl. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαδμία,\r\n\r\nCadmia, _Calamine_; both kinds of it are desiccant, but that which\r\nis called Botryitis, consists of the more subtile particles, and the\r\nPlacitis, of the grosser. When calamine is burnt, it becomes desiccant\r\nand detergent, without pungency, and is also useful for sores requiring\r\nto be filled up, about the eyes and in the whole body, more particularly\r\nthose on softer bodies, which are more humid, for those upon harder\r\nbodies require stronger means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Under this head we cannot do better than in the first\r\nplace copy the account of the ancient cadmia given by the learned and\r\naccurate Geoffroy. “The name _Cadmia_ has been applied to several things.\r\nDioscorides understood by καδμέια the recrements which arise from brass\r\nwhile melting in the furnace. Galen applied it to two substances, one\r\nwhich comes from brass (chalcos?), which is the same with the cadmia\r\nof Dioscorides; the other a native substance found in the island of\r\nCyprus, which he terms λιθῶδης or stony. Pliny, besides the factitious\r\ncadmia of Dioscorides and Galen, mentions another by the name of _Lapis\r\nærosus_, which he says was an ore out of which copper was made, and this\r\nperhaps is the same with the _Cadmia lapidosa_ of Galen.” (ii, 2, 6.)\r\nThe botryital or clustered cadmia was Tutty, or the _Cadmia fornacis_\r\nseu _factitia_. It is the _Zinci Oxydum impurum_. The _Capnitis_ and\r\n_Placitis_ were merely varieties of the same, the former being in the\r\nshape of a fine powder, collected at the mouths of the furnaces, and the\r\nlatter consisting of coarser and heavier grains. The minerals from which\r\nall these preparations of cadmia were prepared, are the two varieties\r\nof calamine, now called by mineralogists “the siliceous oxide of zinc”\r\nand “the carbonate of zinc.” See Cleavland’s ‘Mineralogy’ (656, 657.)\r\nDioscorides gives a very distinct description of the cadmia, which he\r\nrecommends principally in the composition of ophthalmic remedies (v,\r\n84.) Galen’s account of it is to the same effect, and is couched in his\r\npeculiar logical language. (De Simpl. ix.) The Arabians give a confused\r\ndescription of cadmia and the other mineral substances used by the\r\nGreeks in medical practice. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 163, 164); Serapion\r\n(418); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 150.) For an elaborate disquisition on\r\nthe _cadmia_ of the ancients, we beg to refer to Beckmann’s ‘History of\r\nInventions.’\r\n\r\n\r\nΚακκαλία,\r\n\r\nCaccalia; its powers and use are like the Cacanus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See under _Cacanus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαλαμαγρώστις,\r\n\r\nCalamagrostis, is desiccative; wherefore, its juice and the decoction of\r\nthe roots of it are mixed up as ingredients with ophthalmic remedies; but\r\nits seed is diuretic and stomachic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is decidedly the _Calamagrostis Epigeios_ Roth. or\r\nSmall Reed. Dioscorides says it proves destructive to cattle when eaten\r\nby them, especially the variety which grows in Babylon by the wayside.\r\nParkinson (Theatre of Plants, 1181) figures and describes a species of\r\nreed-grass, bearing a considerable resemblance to our _Epigeios_, but of\r\nmore luxuriant growth; which, he says, Lobel calls _Calamagrostis forte\r\nBabylonica_. Neither Galen nor Aëtius treat of it. The Arabians briefly\r\nnotice it under the head of _Theil_ or Gramen, but merely copy from the\r\nGreeks. See Serapion (De Simpl. 119), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 704.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαλαμίνθη,\r\n\r\nCalamintha, _Calamint_, is of a hot and drying temperament in the third\r\ndegree, consists of subtile particles, is acrid, and much stronger than\r\nmint; for it is a sort of wild mint. It, therefore, attracts readily the\r\ndeep-seated fluids to itself, and hence evacuates dropsies, and discusses\r\nswelling of the whole body, and stops periodical rigors, when strongly\r\nrubbed in externally with oil, and when taken internally in a draught.\r\nWhen applied in a clyster it removes pains of the hip-joint, and clears\r\naway impurities from the skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Apuleius says, “Græci calaminthen Latini mentham vocant, alii\r\nnepetam,” (De Herbis.) R. Stephens says, “Calaminthæ Dioscoridi tria sunt\r\ngenera, quorum primum nihil aliud quam vulgare _Calamenthum_; secundum\r\nLatine Nepeta appellatur; tertium est nostra herba Cataria, _l’herbe\r\ndu chat_.” Sprengel makes the first species of Dioscorides to be the\r\n_Melissa Cretica_, L.; the second, the _Thymus Nepeta_, Scop.; and the\r\nthird, the _Melissa altissima_. Our author’s calamint is evidently the\r\nfirst species. Galen, Dioscorides, Aëtius, and Serapion, like Paulus,\r\ndescribe it as a hot and acrid medicine, which proves useful in diseases\r\nof the joints. They all, also, say that it is emmenagogue; and recommend\r\nit as a discutient and expectorant medicine. Dioscorides and Aëtius\r\nrecommend it in elephantiasis, for attenuating and cutting the gross\r\nhumours which give rise to the disease. All agree in praising calamint in\r\nthe cure of intermittent fevers. Dioscorides recommends it as a vermifuge\r\nwhen given with salts and honey. Dioscorides, and, after him, Aëtius and\r\nother of the authorities, say that calamint-water, when injected into the\r\near, kills worms in it. Galen and Dioscorides both affirm that when taken\r\ninternally and applied on a pessary, it procures abortion. All agree that\r\nit is also beneficial in asthmatic complaints. Avicenna gives a lengthy\r\nand very elaborate account of the three species of calamint; but it can\r\nhardly be said that he adds anything of importance to the information\r\nwhich he drew from his Grecian masters. He agrees with them that it is\r\ndiuretic and emmenagogue, and holds that it is anaphrodisiacal, and\r\nremoves the pollutio nocturni somni. He also, like them, commends it as a\r\ndeobstruent in jaundice and other obstructions of the viscera. He praises\r\nit as a stomachic. (ii, 2, 154.) None of the other Arabian authorities\r\ntreat so fully of this article as Avicenna. Rhases, however, is worth\r\nconsulting. (Contin. l. ult. i, 466.) The calamint, that is to say, the\r\nfirst species of Dioscorides, would appear to be the “mentastrum” of\r\nCelsus, who recommends it as a remedy in the bites of venomous animals.\r\n(v, 277.) It also occurs in the ‘Flora Hippocratica.’ See Dierbach. The\r\nthree kinds of calaminth were long retained in the Materia Medica of the\r\nmoderns. See Tournefort’s Materia Medica (i, 6, 4.) More recently only\r\none kind was used. See Quincy. Of late all the kinds have been nearly\r\ndiscarded from our Dispensatories, but are still to be found in the shops\r\nof apothecaries. See Gray’s Supplement to the Pharmacopœia (p. 47.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάλαμος ἀρωματικὸς,\r\n\r\nCalamus Aromaticus, _Sweet-cane_, is heating and desiccant in the second\r\norder. It also consists of subtile particles, and has some astringency.\r\nIt is, therefore, diuretic, and is mixed up with stomachic remedies, and\r\nthose prepared for the liver and womb. The species called phragmitis is\r\ndetergent, but the leaves of it are green and moderately cooling, and the\r\nbark of it, when burnt, is heating and desiccant in the third degree. The\r\nroot of it, when applied with bulbi, is said to extract darts and thorns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Having shown above that the acorus of the ancients is the\r\n_Acorus Pseudacorus_, we need have little hesitation in stating that we\r\nagree with the older authorities, who refer the present article to the\r\n_Acorus Calamus_. Dr. Royle, however, holds that it was the _Andropogon\r\nCalamus aromaticus_. See Hindoo Med. (34) and Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 133.)\r\nThe φραγμίτης of Dioscorides and our author is decidedly the _Arundo\r\nPhragmites_, or Common Reed. Our author follows the description of them\r\ngiven by Dioscorides and Galen, and more especially the latter. Galen\r\nsays of the aromaticus that it is more desiccative than calefacient,\r\nand that it has some volatility, like all the aromatics. Aëtius, in\r\nlike manner, copies mostly from Galen. The Arabians, in treating of\r\nthese reeds, borrow closely from Dioscorides. Thus Avicenna, among\r\nother virtues which he holds that they possess, commends them as being\r\ndiuretic, emmenagogue, and alexipharmic. (ii, 2, 64.) The calami do\r\nnot occur as articles of medicine in the Hippocratic collection. The\r\nCalamus Alexandrinus of Celsus (v, 24), was no doubt the C. aromaticus.\r\nAlthough a native of India, as Dioscorides states, it is likely that the\r\nRomans would get it through Alexandria. It occurs in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia, and is now found growing in Laconia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάμπαι,\r\n\r\nErucæ, _Caterpillar_; those upon potherbs, when rubbed in with oil, are\r\nsaid to preserve from the bites of venomous animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The metamorphosis of _Caterpillar_ is accurately described by\r\nTheophrastus (C. Pl. v.) See also Aristotle (H. A. v, 20), and Pliny (H.\r\nN. xi, 32.) Our author’s account of these erucæ is taken word for word\r\nfrom Dioscorides (ii, 64.) Few of the other authorities treat of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚανθαρίδες,\r\n\r\nCantharides; those found among wheat, have pale, transverse zones, and\r\nbeing suffocated by the steam of hot vinegar, are used for many purposes.\r\nFor, with cerate, they cast off scabious nails, and relieve clavi and\r\nscabious affections. They are also corrosive and caustic. Some mix a\r\nsmall quantity of them with diuretic remedies, and give them in this form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and Galen direct the species which is found among\r\ncorn to be used medicinally. As the _Meloe vesicatorius_ is commonly\r\nfound upon trees, such as the fraxinus, sambuchus, and ligustrum, it is\r\nevidently different from the ancient cantharis, and yet their effects\r\nupon the human frame would appear to have been very much alike. It\r\nappears to be now agreed upon by all competent judges that the medicinal\r\ncantharis of the ancients is the _Mylabris Cichorii_ or _M. Füsselini_,\r\nwhich is still used for forming blistering plasters by the profession in\r\nConstantinople and by the native practitioners in Hindostan. See Ainslie\r\n(Mat. Ind., i, 622), Royle (Antiq. of Hindoo Med.), and Pereira (1834.)\r\nThe _Buprestis_, however, which also is included by Dioscorides in his\r\nMateria Medica, can have been no other than the _Meloe vesicatorius_.\r\nSee Book V of this work. It is the tellini fly of the Hindoos. See\r\nAinslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 417.) The ancients prepared the cantharides for\r\nmedicinal use in the same manner as the Spanish fly is now prepared,\r\nnamely, by killing them with the fumes of vinegar. Dioscorides says\r\ncantharides are septic, ulcerative, and calefacient, and hence are mixed\r\nup with the medicines that cure cancerous diseases, leprosy, and lichen\r\nagrius; they are also emmenagogue when applied in a pessary; and some,\r\nhe adds, relate that cantharides are beneficial in dropsies, by acting\r\nas diuretics. Their wings and feet are further said to be antidotal,\r\nthat is to say, we suppose, to counteract the operation of the body of\r\nthe insect. (ii, 65, 66.) Galen treats of the cantharis and buprestis\r\nin very nearly the same terms as Dioscorides. Instead of using only\r\nthe wings and feet, as mentioned by Dioscorides, he says that he used\r\nthe whole insect. (De Simpl. xi.) In moderate doses he held it to be a\r\nsafe diuretic. (ii, 463, ed. Basil.) Aëtius and Oribasius give nearly\r\nthe same account of the cantharis as Galen. Cantharides are frequently\r\nmentioned in the Hippocratic treatises (De Nat. Mulier. 565, ed. Föes; De\r\nIntern. Affect. 552), and in the works of Celsus. (199, ed. Milligan.)\r\nAretæus is the first author, as far as we know, who notices the external\r\nuse of cantharides as a rubefacient. (De Curat. Morb. Chron. i, 4.) The\r\nArabians, in treating of cantharides, borrow nearly all the information\r\nthey give from Dioscorides and Galen. See Serapion (c. 441), Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 201), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 162.) Rhases on his own authority,\r\naffirms, that administered in small doses cantharides cleanse the\r\nkidneys. We are rather surprised to find that the _Mylabris_ does not\r\noccur in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάνναβις,\r\n\r\nCannabis, _Hemp_; the fruit is carminative and desiccative, so as to dry\r\nup even the semen. The juice of it when green is useful for pains of the\r\nears and obstructions of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears evidently to be the _Cannabis sativa_, or Hemp.\r\nThe species _sylvestris_ of Dioscorides, is the _Althæa Cannabina_. See\r\nSprengel (ad Dioscorid. iii, 155), and Parkinson (Theatre of Plants,\r\n307.) Dioscorides recommends the latter in the form of a cataplasm to\r\nsoothe inflammations and discuss tumours. Our author copies from Galen,\r\nwho, like him, only describes the _sativa_. The Arabians describe both\r\nspecies with more accuracy than the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 170,\r\n656), Serapion (207.) Avicenna calls them carminative and desiccative;\r\nand hence he holds that they dry up the semen. He says a middling dose\r\nproves laxative of the bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάνωπον,\r\n\r\nCanopum, _the Flower of the Elder-tree_, which has been already treated\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάπνιον,\r\n\r\nFumaria, _Fumitory_ (called also Capnos), and is so named because the\r\njuice of it provokes a great discharge of tears; and it sharpens the\r\nvision. It is also acrid and bitter; hence it occasions a discharge of\r\nmuch bilious urine, and cures obstructions and atony of the liver. It\r\nalso strengthens the stomach and softens the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the commentators seem agreed that it is the _Fumaria\r\nofficinalis_, except Sibthorp, who prefers the _F. parviflora_, Lam.\r\nOur author’s account of it is mostly taken from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nThe others give nearly the same description of its medicinal virtues.\r\nSee particularly Serapion (c. 71), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 275.) They\r\nrepresent it as being a stomachic and hepatic medicine, gently purgative\r\nand diuretic. Fumitory is described as a medicinal herb by all our old\r\nherbalists, and held a place in the Dispensatory down to a late date. See\r\nQuincy (125.) The _F. officinalis_ is still retained in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάππαρις,\r\n\r\nCaparis, _Caper-tree_; its root deterges, purges, incides, and discusses\r\nby its bitterness and acrimony. It also contracts, astringes, and\r\ncondenses by its sourness. It therefore cures indurated spleens when\r\ndrunk and when applied externally. It is also emmenagogue, and occasions\r\na discharge of phlegm. It cures ill-conditioned ulcers, and relieves\r\npains of the teeth, dispels tumours and alphos, and kills vermin in the\r\near. The leaves and fruit of it are possessed of similar powers, but\r\nweaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Capparis spinosa_, namely, the plant which\r\nproduces our officinal capers. Dioscorides and Serapion mention that\r\npickled capers act as a gentle laxative, but say that they are bad\r\nfor the stomach. The Arabians held that they are good whetters of the\r\nappetite. Casiri (Bibl. A. H. i, 337.) Galen gives a very elaborate\r\narticle on the virtues of capers, which, he says, are the best medicine\r\nwhich we possess in scirrhous enlargement of the spleen. He says it\r\nclears away the humours by the belly and by urine, and also acts as\r\nan emmenagogue. Their taste, he says, is a combination of bitterness,\r\nacrimony, and sourness. He concludes by stating that capers produced\r\nin very warm climates, such as Arabia, are much more acrid than in his\r\ncountry. (De Simpl. vii.) The Arabians held that capers are aphrodisiacal\r\nand alexipharmic. See Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 164), Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n138), and Serapion (c. 291.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάρδαμος,\r\n\r\nNasturtium, _Cress_; the seed of it is caustic like mustard. When applied\r\nexternally, therefore, it proves rubefacient, incides also the thick\r\nhumours when drunk with other things. And the dried herb is possessed of\r\nsimilar powers, but the juicy one is more moderate; it therefore is eaten\r\nraw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It was indisputably a species of cress, probably the\r\n_Lepidium sativum_. We have treated of it as an article of food in Book\r\nI. Our author’s account of it is mostly derived from Galen. Symeon Seth,\r\nwith most of the authorities, calls it aphrodisiacal. Macer says, on\r\nthe contrary, that its powers are equal to those of rue for repressing\r\nvenereal desires. Dioscorides calls it alexipharmic, and says of it,\r\nthat in fumigations it drives away venomous reptiles. It occurs in\r\nthe Flora Hippocratica. See Dierbach. The Arabians treat of it very\r\nelaborately. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 472), Avicenna (ii, 2, 502),\r\nand Serapion (c. 359.) They agree that it evacuates bile both upwards\r\nand downwards, that it is aphrodisiac and alexipharmic. The cress\r\n(_Nasturtium_), until very lately, was admitted into our Dispensatory.\r\nSee Gerard, Parkinson, Culpeper, and Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρδάμωμον,\r\n\r\nCardamomum, _Cardamum_, is also acrid, but weaker than the Cardamus. It\r\nhas also some bitterness, by which it destroys intestinal worms, and with\r\nvinegar clears away scabies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The officinal cardamom of the present time has now got the\r\nscientific name of _Elettaria Cardamomum_, and as far as we can see\r\nthere is no reason to doubt its being identical with the cardamomum of\r\nthe ancients. There are, however, several varieties of the cardamom\r\nwhich are not satisfactorily defined, any more than the four species\r\nmentioned by Pliny. (H. N. xii, 29.) See Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 32), and\r\nPereira (Mat. Med. 694.) Dioscorides recommends it for various purposes,\r\nboth externally and internally; for epilepsy, coughs, ischiatic disease,\r\nnephritis, and as an alexipharmic and lithontriptic medicine. (i, 5.)\r\nGalen is more guarded in enumerating its virtues, and all the other Greek\r\nauthorities follow him. The Arabians rather imitate Dioscorides. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 156), and Serapion (c. 64.) One of Serapion’s Arabian\r\nauthorities, Isaac eben Amram, describes two species, the greater and the\r\nlesser, a distinction still recognized. We need scarcely add that it is\r\nwell known at the present day, and is used for various purposes both in\r\nthis country and in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρὶς,\r\n\r\nSquilla, _a Legless Lobster_, when triturated and drunk with the root of\r\nbryony it kills lumbrici.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The squilla belongs to the order of μαλακόστρακα. (See Book\r\nI, 91.) The present article we suppose is the _Cancer Squilla_, L. It is\r\ntreated of very cursorily by the other authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρκίνος,\r\n\r\nCancer, _Crab_; of the ashes of burnt crabs, that of river-crabs is\r\nequally desiccative with those of the sea urchins and cockles. By the\r\npeculiarity of its whole substance it proves wonderfully efficacious when\r\napplied to persons bitten by mad dogs, as mentioned in another place. The\r\nashes of the sea-crabs being extremely desiccative, do not indeed agree\r\nwith them, but rather relieve those who stand in need of desiccative\r\nremedies. The river-crab when pulverised and applied, ejects thorns and\r\nthe points of darts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Cancer Pagurus_, a large edible crab, would appear to be\r\nthe sea animal treated of under this head. The river-crab, we suppose, is\r\nthe _Astacus fluviatilis_, or crawfish. Dioscorides recommends the ashes\r\nof the river-crab most especially in hydrophobia, and as an application\r\nto fissures in the feet and anus, chilblains, and cancers, and also\r\nas an antidote to the bites of venomous animals. Galen also gives an\r\ninteresting account of the use of them in hydrophobia, and Serapion\r\nrepeats Galen’s account of them. See further, Book V, 3, of this work.\r\nGalen speaks with great confidence of their efficacy in this case, indeed\r\nhe affirms that he had never known them fail when they had got a fair\r\ntrial. The other authorities supply no additional information of interest\r\nunder this head. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 147), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. iii,\r\n42.) These two agree that the flesh of the river-crab with the milk of\r\nasses is beneficial in phthisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάρον,\r\n\r\nCarum, _Caraway_; the seed is desiccant and heating in the third degree;\r\nand not only the seed, but also the whole plant is carminative and\r\ndiuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Carum Carui_. It is\r\nevidently the careum of Pliny, and derives its name from Caria. (H. N.\r\nxxix, 49.) Our author copies closely from Galen. Dioscorides calls it\r\ndiuretic, stomachic, pleasant to the taste, digestive, &c. The Arabians\r\nfurther give it the character of being a cordial and anthelminthic\r\nmedicine. (See Serapion (c. 279), Avicenna (ii, 2, 137), and Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 178.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρπήσιον,\r\n\r\nCarpesium, is aromatic, and consists of subtile particles. It therefore\r\nclears away visceral obstructions, proves diuretic, and removes calculi\r\nof the kidneys.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Arabians identified this substance with their own\r\n_Cubebæ_. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 242), Avicenna (ii, 2, 134),\r\nand Serapion (c. 188.) But we will show in another place that this was\r\na mistake on their part. Nothing satisfactory has been ascertained\r\nregarding it, and we have no pleasure in dwelling upon the conjectures of\r\nthe commentators on Dioscorides and of the herbalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρύον,\r\n\r\nNux Juglans, _Walnut_; the tree has some astringency in the shoots, but\r\nmore in the bark of the nuts. The juice of them, therefore, when boiled\r\nwith honey, becomes a stomachic medicine. The rind of it, when burnt,\r\nconsists of subtile particles, and becomes desiccant without pungency;\r\nbut the edible part of it being oily, is readily converted into bile.\r\nThe oil formed from them consists of subtile particles, and discusses\r\nswellings and gangrenes. Walnuts which are rancid from age prove\r\ndetergent of cutaneous affections. But the Pontic, called the slender\r\nnut, is colder and austere, but in other respects is like the large.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of this article in the portion of our work\r\ndevoted to dietetics. See Book I. We shall merely repeat that the two\r\nspecies of nuts described by Paulus and other ancient authorities are\r\nevidently the _Nux Juglans_, or walnut, and the _Nux Avellana_, or\r\nfilbert. This is very evident from Galen’s description of them. (Opera.\r\ned. Basil, ii, 88.) Our author copies closely from him. Dioscorides\r\ntreats of the nuces still more circumstantially, recommending them both\r\ninternally and externally as being vermifuge, and curing ill-conditioned\r\nulcers, and many other diseases. The filbert, when triturated with axunge\r\nor bear’s grease, he recommends for the cure of baldness. (i, 178,\r\n179.) The Arabians, under this head, do little more than condense the\r\ninformation supplied to them by their Grecian masters. See in particular\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 505), Avicenna (ii, 2, 42, 494), and Serapion\r\n(c. 162.) Serapion states that the nux avellana is useful in catarrhs,\r\nand as an application in cases of alopecia. Here, however, he professes\r\nto borrow from Dioscorides. Avicenna and Rhases recommend the oil of the\r\nhazel-nut in herpes esthiomenos, erysipelas, and fistula lachrymalis.\r\nThey speak favorably of both as a remedy for the bites of venomous\r\nanimals. They also are agreed that the walnut is expectorant.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαρυόφυλλον,\r\n\r\nCaryophyllum, _Cloves_; they are not the substance which their name might\r\nimply, but, as it were, the flowers of a tree which are brought from\r\nIndia; like chaff, black, nearly a finger’s length, aromatic, acrid,\r\nbitterish, hot, and desiccative in about the third degree. They serve\r\nmany useful purposes for condiments and other medicines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From our author’s description there cannot be the least\r\nhesitation on our part in acknowledging it to be the _Caryophyllus\r\naromaticus_, L. (_i. q._), _Eugenia Caryophyllata_, Thunberg, that is\r\nto say, the Clove-tree. We are equally well convinced that no mention\r\nof this article is to be found in the works of Dioscorides, Pliny,\r\nTheophrastus, Galen, Aëtius, Oribasius, nor, in short, in those of any\r\npreceding author. Whence Paulus drew his knowledge of it cannot now\r\nbe ascertained. The Arabians display a very correct acquaintance with\r\nit. Avicenna, in treating of it, refers to no other Greek authority\r\nbut Paulus. After describing it in much the same terms as our author,\r\nhe states it to be hot and dry in the third degree, says it renders\r\nthe breath fragrant, improves the sight, and is useful in pterygium;\r\nis stomachic and hepatic, and removes vomiting and nausea. (ii, 2,\r\n311.) Serapion, in treating of the _Gariofilus_, first quotes from a\r\ntranslation of Galen the description of the _Garyophyllon_ given by\r\nPaulus, which he affirms is taken line for line from Galen. This is\r\nevidently a mistake, founded on some erroneous translation of Galen into\r\nArabic. He then gives its characters from several Arabian authorities\r\nto the effect that it is stomachic, hepatic, cordial, aphrodisiacal,\r\nand digestive; and says that it is brought from India. (c. 319.) Rhases\r\nsays cloves are hot and dry, and are both stomachic and cordial. (Ad\r\nMansor. iii, 22.) We have not been able to find the passage in the\r\n‘Continens’ where they are treated of, there being some mistake in the\r\nmarginal reference of Avicenna. Symeon Seth says of the caryophyllon\r\nthat it is hot and dry in the second, or, perhaps, in the third degree;\r\nis the fruit of a tree, and is stomachic, hepatic, and cordial; removes\r\nnausea connected with humidity, but is bad for the bowels. (c. 15.) The\r\ncaryophyllon also occurs in one of the antidotes of Myrepsus. (c. 22.)\r\nEbn Baithar, however, is the ancient authority who gives the fullest\r\naccount of cloves, which he represents as being useful in diabetes and\r\nstrangury, in black bile, diarrhœa, and chronic coughs. He says in\r\nparticular that they are uterine and aphrodisiac, and hence warm the\r\nuterus and promote impregnation. He also holds that they are stomachic,\r\ncarminative, and hepatic. (ii, 281.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚάσσαμον,\r\n\r\nCassamum; some say that it is the fruit of the balsam-tree, of which we\r\nhave treated under that word.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚασσία,\r\n\r\nCassia, is heating and desiccative in the third order, consists of\r\nsufficiently subtile particles, is acrid, and moderately astringent. It\r\nis therefore incisive and discutient, imparts strength to the organs, and\r\nis also emmenagogue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Salmasius contends that the ancient Cassia was the same as\r\nour cinnamon. See Needham (ad Geopon. vii, 13), and Celsus (Hierobot.\r\nin voce Kiddah.) Stackhouse affirms, however, that the ancients were\r\nunacquainted with the _Laurus Cinnamomum_. He refers it to the _Laurus\r\ngracilis_. (Comment. in Theophrast.) Sprengel, in his R. H. H., makes\r\nit to be the _Laurus Cassia_, which has now got the scientific name\r\n_Cinnamomum Cassia_. The close connexion between the cinnamon and cassia\r\nhas occasioned difficulty in distinguishing them from one another, down\r\neven to the present times. They are often sold for one another in the\r\nIndian bazaars. The _Cassia lignea_ of the ancients would appear to\r\nhave been the same thing as the _Cassia bark_ of the moderns. According\r\nto Ainslie, the odour of it is very like cinnamon, but fainter. (Mat.\r\nInd. 35.) The _Cassia Fistula_ was merely the bark rolled up into\r\n_fistulæ_, or pipes. The Greeks, as we shall show in another place, were\r\nunacquainted with the true _Cassia Fistula_. Dioscorides describes\r\nseveral varieties of it which cannot now be readily recognized. He calls\r\nit heating, diuretic, desiccant, and mildly astringent, and recommends it\r\nas an emmenagogue, and for various other medicinal purposes. He concludes\r\nby saying it may be used in place of cinnamon, and that it is useful for\r\nmany purposes. (i, 12.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat of\r\nit briefly, in nearly the same terms as Paulus. All the Arabians treat\r\nof it fully. See in particular Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 183), Serapion (c.\r\n301), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 151.) Avicenna describes circumstantially\r\nseveral kinds of cassia, which he says is closely allied to cinnamon\r\nin nature and in virtues. He recommends it in diseases of the eyes and\r\nuterus, and joins Serapion in holding it to be alexipharmic. The only\r\nArabian authority quoted by Rhases under this head (namely, Misib) calls\r\nit stomachic, hepatic, and attenuant. The same authority is quoted by\r\nSerapion. Another of Serapion’s authorities says it has strong powers for\r\nprocuring abortion. The cassia occurs in the works of Hippocrates, and in\r\nthose of Celsus. The latter ranks it in his list of discutients. (v, 11.)\r\nGalen states that, in the absence of cinnamon, a double dose of cassia\r\nor of carpesium may be used in place of it. (ii, 434, ed. Basil.) It is\r\ndescribed by Theophrastus (H. P. ix, 5), and Pliny (xi, 43).\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαστόριον,\r\n\r\nCastorium, _Castor_, is heating and desiccative, with excessive tenuity\r\nof parts, by which, in addition to its other actions, it is rendered a\r\nsuitable remedy for affections of the nerves proceeding from a collection\r\nof humours. It also readily warms parts which are immoderately cooled,\r\nboth when applied externally and when drunk, without at all injuring\r\nany other part, even if they should be in a state of moderate fever, as\r\nin cataphora and lethargy. It is likewise emmenagogue, and expels the\r\nsecundines. In affections of the brain and lungs it is a very efficacious\r\nremedy, even when inhaled in respiration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the ancient authorities describe the Castor as being the\r\ntesticles of the beaver (_Castor Fiber_, L.) Matthiolus, we believe, was\r\nthe first to rectify this error. It is a substance contained in follicles\r\nsituated between the anus and genital organs. The use of castor in\r\nhysteria is mentioned by Herodotus. (iv.) Dioscorides, Galen, Rhases,\r\nand Serapion, like our author, recommend it as an emmenagogue; Celsus\r\nprescribes castor with pepper in cases of tetanus. (iv. 3.) He also\r\nrecommends it in lethargy and deafness. (vi.) Pliny also mentions its\r\nbeing used in tetanus and other cases where soporifics are indicated.\r\n(H. N. xxxii, 3, 8.) Of all the ancient authorities Avicenna treats\r\nof it most fully, recommending it particularly in nervous affections,\r\nstupor, and paralysis, also in hiccough when drunk with vinegar, and as\r\na carminative in flatulence of the bowels. The best counter-agents to\r\nit are acid citrons, vinegar with wine and asses’ milk. He says of it,\r\nthat it is alexipharmic, and proves beneficial in the suffocation induced\r\nby hellebore. (ii, 2, 122.) Serapion copies literally from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen (c. 445.) Rhases recommends it as a calefacient medicine for\r\nwarming the nerves, promoting menstruation, and dissolving swellings. (Ad\r\nMansor. iii, 30.) The account which he gives of it in his ‘Continens’ is\r\nmade up of extracts from Dioscorides, Galen, and our author. (l. ult.\r\n188.) Ebn Baithar gives a very lengthy and not uninteresting account of\r\nthis substance. (i, 263.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚαυκαλὶς,\r\n\r\nCaucalis, _Wild Carrot_; it is heating, like the carrot, desiccant,\r\ndiuretic, and is pickled as a preserve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sibthorp supposed it to be the _Tordylium officinale_; but\r\nperhaps we may venture to refer it rather to the _Caucalis maritima_,\r\nLam. R. Stephens calls it _Persil batard_, i. e. _Bastard parsley_. It\r\nis more properly an article of food than a medicine. Our author borrows\r\nhis account of it from Dioscorides and Galen, and none of the other\r\nauthorities supply any additional information of interest respecting\r\nit. In modern times its application in medicine has been extended. See\r\nMatthiolus (in Dioscorid.) and Parkinson (922.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚέγχρος,\r\n\r\nMilium, _Millet_, is cooling in the first degree, and desiccant in the\r\nsecond. It also, to a certain degree, consists of subtile particles.\r\nWhen used then for a fomentation in small bags, and in the form of a\r\ncataplasm, it is of a desiccant nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dierbach inclines to the _Holcus Sorghum_, a species of\r\nmillet called _Sorgo_ or _Guinea corn_. Most of the other authorities\r\nrefer it to the _Panicum Italicum_. (See Sprengel, Schneider, and\r\nParkinson.) We have treated of it among the articles of food in Book I.\r\nAs a medicine, it is principally in the form of a fomentation that it is\r\nprescribed by Dioscorides and the other authorities. Galen does not speak\r\nvery favorably of the cataplasm prepared from it. The Arabians treat of\r\nit in much the same terms as the Greeks. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n532), Avicenna (ii, 2, 288), and Serapion (c. 102.) They all speak of it\r\nas being a very inferior article of food; and as a medicine, recommend it\r\nonly in a fomentation. It was retained in our English Dispensatory down\r\nto a late date. See Quincy. To this day it is much prized by the native\r\npractitioners of Hindostan. See Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 124.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚέδρος,\r\n\r\nCedrus, _Cedar_ (?), or _Juniper_; the shrub, which resembles juniper,\r\nand the tree are calefacient and desiccative in the third degree; but\r\nthe oil prepared from them, which they call cedræa, touches upon the\r\nfourth, being composed of sufficiently subtile particles. It therefore\r\ncorrodes soft flesh readily, and without pain; and the hard flesh, more\r\nparticularly of dead bodies, it dries and preserves from putrefaction. It\r\nkills lice, nits, ascarides, worms in the ears, and has many other powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two species, the larger being probably\r\nthe _Juniperus Phœnicea_, and the smaller the _Juniperus communis_.\r\nThe ἄρκευθος was a species of the same genus. Pliny calls the pitch of\r\nthe tree by the name of _Cedria_, and the oil by that of _Pisselæon_.\r\nIs the cedria the gum vernix, called sandarax by the Arabians? We will\r\ndiscuss this question in the Appendix to this Book, when we come to treat\r\nof the substances introduced into the Materia Medica by the Arabians.\r\nDioscorides says of the fruit of the cedar or juniper, that it is\r\ncalefacient and bad for the stomach, that it is useful in coughs, as an\r\nemmenagogue, and alexipharmic. (i, 105.) Galen says the fruit is edible,\r\nbut apt to occasion headache and pain of the stomach. (De Simpl. vii.)\r\nThe Arabians treat fully of it. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 160, 668.) He and\r\nthe other Arabians borrow nearly all their information from the Greeks.\r\nEven Ebn Baithar contains little that is original under this head. (ii,\r\n94.) We observe, by the way, that his translator, Dr. Sontheimer, marks\r\nit as the _Pinus Cedrus_, but this it clearly cannot be.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚεντάυριον,\r\n\r\nCentaurium, _Centaury_; the root of the great centaury is acrid and\r\nheating, with a terrene astringency. It therefore promotes menstruation,\r\nkills and expels the fœtus, agglutinates wounds, relieves hæmoptysis,\r\nand other affections of the chest. The root of the small centaury is\r\npossessed of no powers, but the branches are strongly desiccative, and\r\nwithout pungency. Hence they are applicable in those cases in which the\r\ngreat centaury was mentioned as being useful; and in ischiatic complaints\r\nthe decoction of it given in an injection evacuates bile and sometimes\r\nblood, which affords great relief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Centaurea Centaurium_, L., and the _Erythræa\r\nCentaurium_, Pers., would appear to be the greater and less centaury\r\nof the ancients. See Parkinson, Sprengel, and the other commentators\r\non Dioscorides. Pliny describes three sorts, but would seem to have\r\nfallen into a mistake as to the meaning of a passage in Theophrastus.\r\nSee Harduin ad Plinii H. N. xxv, 32, and Parkinson (Theatre of Plants,\r\n273.) Dioscorides recommends the greater centaury in the same cases as\r\nour author, who abridges him and Galen under this head. He says very\r\nparticularly of it, that it produces menstruation, and expels the fœtus\r\nwhen applied in the form of a collyrium (tent) to the vagina. (iii,\r\n6.) The Arabians give it the same characters as their Grecian masters.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 158), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 176), and Serapion\r\n(c. 202.) Serapion and Mesue likewise recommend the lesser centaury\r\nin sciatica, either in a potion to the amount of two drachms, or in a\r\nclyster to the amount of three ounces, with oil of sesame. Galen has a\r\nwhole book on the virtues of the lesser centaury, in which there is a\r\nprescription for an extract of it. The ancients had great faith in it\r\nfor the cure of hydrophobia. According to Galen, (who it may well be\r\nsupposed had devoted great attention to the study of its virtues), it is\r\npossessed of bitterness with some astringency, and is most especially\r\nexcellent as a deobstruent in obstructions of the liver and scirrhus\r\nof the spleen. He mentions that some gave it in a potion for nervous\r\naffections, and that in a clyster it relieves sciatica by occasioning\r\nevacuations of bile. He also recommends it strongly in the form of a\r\nfomentation to ill-conditioned and obstinate ulcers. The lesser centaury\r\n(_Erythræa Centaurium_, Persoon) still continues to hold a place in our\r\nDispensatory, but, as Dr. Pereira remarks, “is rarely used by medical\r\npractitioners; yet it might be used as an indigenous substitute for\r\ngentian.” (Materia Medica, 809.) In the days of Quincy it retained\r\nall its ancient characters. (Engl. Dispens. 103.) Galen’s tract on it\r\nmust have been in great repute anciently, since Serapion has given a\r\ntranslation of the whole of it. It is retained in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚέρας ἀιγὸς,\r\n\r\nCornu Capri, _Goatshorn_, and Κ. ἐλάφου, Cornu Cervi, _Hartshorn_,\r\ncleanse the teeth when burnt, and restrain the progress of foul ulcers.\r\nThe hart’s horn, when pulverised and then applied, fastens loose teeth;\r\nwhen washed after burning, it relieves dysentery, cæliac affection,\r\nspitting of blood, and jaundice, when given to the amount of two\r\nspoonfuls. It is also mixed up with ophthalmic remedies. The horn of a\r\nbull, when taken in water, restrains hemorrhages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, Galen, and Serapion speak of the medicinal\r\nproperties of _horn_ in nearly the same terms as our author. We need\r\nscarcely say that the stag’s or hart’s horn has been much used in modern\r\ntimes for the preparation of ammonia, which is hence called the spirit of\r\nhartshorn. Dioscorides recommends hartshorn when burnt until it become\r\nwhite, and cleaned like calamine, in affections of the eyes. It will now\r\nbe readily understood, that when so treated it is reduced to a phosphate\r\nof lime. Avicenna further prescribes it for removing the swelling of\r\ndropsy; and, like Dioscorides, he recommends it in jaundice. (ii, 2,\r\n178.) We would remark, in conclusion, that it was the red deer which\r\nfurnished the medicinal hartshorn of the ancients, but that the moderns\r\nhave commonly used the horns of the fallow-deer instead. See Hill’s\r\nMateria Medica (835.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚεράσια,\r\n\r\nCerasia, _Cherries_; the sweet are more laxative, the austere more\r\nstomachic, but the acid agree best with pituitous and foul stomachs,\r\nowing to their being incisive. The gum of the tree smoothes asperities of\r\nthe trachea, and relieves calculous affections when drunk with wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This unquestionably is the _Prunus Cerasus_, L. We have\r\ngiven some account of cherries in the portion of our work devoted to\r\nancient dietetics. Galen, in his work on Simples, treats of them with\r\ngreat precision; he remarks that in some the austere quality, in some the\r\nsweet, and in others the acid prevails, and that when unripe the sour is\r\npredominant. In fact, our author’s account of them is manifestly abridged\r\nfrom Galen. Aëtius and the other authorities, in like manner, copy from\r\nGalen. See also Serapion (c. 145.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚερατωνία,\r\n\r\nCeratonia, _Carob-tree_, and the fruit of it (_siliquæ_) are possessed of\r\ndesiccant and astringent powers, with a certain share of sweetness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is unquestionably the _Ceratonia Siliqua_, L., or\r\n_Carob-tree_. We have given some account of it among the articles of food\r\nin Book I. All the other authorities on the Materia Medica give it nearly\r\nthe same characters as our author. The writer who is fullest on this head\r\nis Avicenna, who treats of it under the name of _Carob_, i. e. _Siliqua_.\r\n(ii, 2, 193.) See also Serapion (c. 135), and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n366.) Our modern herbalists treat of it in nearly the same terms as the\r\nancients. See Parkinson (236.) It is still used on the Continent and in\r\nAsia as an inferior article of food, and holds a place in the modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚεφαλαὶ,\r\n\r\nCapita, _Heads_; those of pickled herrings, when burnt, acquire a\r\ndesiccative power without being very acrid. They therefore relieve\r\nfissures about the anus, and chronic cases of indurated uvula. The\r\nentire head of the anchovy (_smaris_), when burnt, is useful in alopecia\r\nwhen applied with bear’s grease. The burnt head of a mouse when applied\r\nwith honey does the same thing. The dried head of the kite without its\r\nfeathers, when drunk in water to as great an amount as can be lifted with\r\nthree fingers, relieves gouty affections. They say that the head of a\r\nlizard extracts sharp-pointed things, and removes myrmecia, acrochordon,\r\nand clavus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _Heads_\r\nis taken from Galen. See also Aëtius and Serapion. Dioscorides treats\r\nof the different articles separately, and not under a general head like\r\nGalen and his successors. (See ii, 31, 32, &c.) The Arabians merely copy\r\nfrom Dioscorides and Galen, especially the latter. See in particular\r\nSerapion (c. 571.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚηκὶς,\r\n\r\nGalla, _Gall_; that sort called Omphacitis is a very sour medicine, and\r\nhence it proves desiccant, repels defluxions, contracts and astringes\r\nrelaxed and debilitated parts. It agrees also with all cases of\r\ndefluxion. It is to be placed in the third rank of desiccants, and the\r\nsecond of refrigerants. The other sort, which is yellow, porous, and\r\nlarge, is desiccant indeed, but less so than the other, inasmuch as it\r\nis deficient in astringency. In a decoction it relieves inflammations of\r\nthe fundament and prolapsus ani when burnt. Extinguished in vinegar they\r\nbecome styptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two species of galls, of which the\r\nbetter kind, called omphacitis, consisted of small, hard, and solid\r\npieces without perforations, and is not to be confounded with the\r\nὄμφακις, or cupula of the acorn, mentioned by Paulus. (iii, 62.) See also\r\nTheophrastus (Hist. Plant. iii, 9), Pliny (H. N. xvi, 9), and Serapion\r\n(De Simpl. c. 237.) Galls were much used by the ancient physicians in\r\nall cases requiring powerful astringents. According to Dr. Hill, the\r\n_Gallæ omphacitæ_ of the ancients were the same as the Aleppo galls now\r\nin use, and the other kind, sometimes called _Onocicæ_, the same as\r\nthe European. Dioscorides describes the gall as the fruit of the oak,\r\nan error which is to be found, as Dr. Pereira remarks, in the works of\r\ncomparatively recent writers. We need scarcely say that the excrescence\r\nis now well ascertained to be the production of a hymenopterous insect\r\non the _Quercus infectoria_. Dioscorides treats largely of the cases in\r\nwhich galls are applicable, concluding with the remark that their use is\r\nindicated whenever it is wished to astringe, restrain, or dry. (ii, 146.)\r\nOur author’s description of their medicinal properties is mostly taken\r\nfrom Galen. Nearly the same may be said of Aëtius and Oribasius. The\r\nArabians, in treating of them, borrow all the information which they give\r\nfrom the Greeks. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 308), Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 234), Serapion (c. 98.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚηπέα,\r\n\r\nCepea, resembles the Purslain. The leaves of it in an infusion relieve\r\nscabious bladder when drunk; and the root of it, when taken in a draught\r\nwith rock asparagus, relieves strangury from obstruction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Little is known for certain of this herb; but the most\r\nprobable conjecture that has been made regarding it is, that it is the\r\n_Sedum Cepæa_, L. Our author’s account of it is taken literally from\r\nDioscorides. Galen does not treat of it, nor have we been able to trace\r\nit out in the Materia Medica of the Arabians. Our old herbalists treat\r\nof it very hesitatingly under the head of brooklime. See Gerard and\r\nParkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚηρὸς,\r\n\r\nCera, _Wax_, being of a moderate temperament, forms the basis of many\r\nother medicines. By itself it is slightly detergent, and has some\r\ndiscutient and calefacient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article is so well known that it requires no\r\nillustration. Dioscorides describes very circumstantially the process\r\nfor bleaching wax and making it white. It was done with salt water and\r\nnatron in a manner quite different from the process now pursued for this\r\npurpose. (ii, 105.) The Arabians treat fully of it, but without making\r\nany addition of much importance. See in particular Serapion (c. 10) and\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 462.) Avicenna says that wax, when applied to the wound\r\ninflicted by a poisoned arrow, prevents it from being followed by any bad\r\neffects. He recommends it as an expectorant in diseases of the chest,\r\nboth in a liniment and in a potion. One of Serapion’s authorities,\r\nAbugerig, in like manner, recommends it in diseases of the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚήρυκες,\r\n\r\nBuccinæ (a species of shell-fish); their shell when burnt is possessed\r\nof sufficiently desiccative powers without pungency, they therefore\r\nagree with malignant ulcers, and are to be used for putrid ulcers with\r\nvinegar, wine, or oxymel. That part of them which is as it were their\r\nflesh when alive, if boiled in oil, renders the oil an useful injection\r\nfor relieving earache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel makes them to be the _Buccina Harpa_ and _Lapillus_.\r\nThey are noticed among the articles of food in the ninety-first section\r\nof the First Book. Dioscorides correctly remarks that a species of\r\nquicklime is got from their shells. He recommends it as a dentifrice, and\r\nas an application to burns. (ii, 5.) Galen very properly inculcates the\r\nnecessity of getting them finely levigated before applying them to sores.\r\nAvicenna treats of the buccina along with other crustacea under one head.\r\nHis information is almost entirely borrowed from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n(ii, 2, 529.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 224.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚίκι,\r\n\r\nRicinus, _Palma Christi_; its fruit, which is also purgative, has\r\ndetergent and discutient properties, and so also has its leaf, but\r\nweaker. We have already spoken of its oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that the κίκι or κρότων was the\r\n_Ricinus communis_, the Castor-oil plant, or Palma Christi. It is\r\nmentioned by Herodotus (Euterpe, 94) and in several passages of the\r\nHippocratic treatises. See Œconom. Hippocrat. (218.) It does not occur,\r\nhowever, in the works of Celsus. Dioscorides informs us that it is called\r\n_croton_, from its resemblance to the dog-tick, and it is worthy of\r\nobservation that both the plant and the dog-tick bear the name of Ricinus\r\nin Latin. See Pliny (H. N. xi, 34, and xv, 7.) Dioscorides says that the\r\noil is used for lamps and plasters, and also as a purgative and emetic;\r\nbut that it is a very loathsome and harsh medicine when administered\r\ninternally. He further mentions the seeds as being used in cutaneous\r\ndiseases, and the leaves in diseases of the eyes (iv, 141.) Galen notices\r\nit but very briefly as a purgative having detergent and discutient\r\npowers. Aëtius and Oribasius appear to have overlooked it. Mesue commends\r\nit as a purgative in cases of colic attended with flatulence. He says\r\nit produces vomiting and painful dejection of the bowels, but that its\r\noperation occasions a discharge of phlegm and bile, which often proves\r\neffectual in diseases of the joints. (De Simpl. 28.) He calls it by the\r\nnames of _Albemesuch_, _Granum regum_, and _Kerva_. Avicenna says of\r\nthe oil, that it is laxative, and is a good application to scabies and\r\nother cutaneous diseases. (ii, 2, 523.) It is deserving of remark that\r\nthe _Grana regia_ of Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 339), are applicable to\r\nthe _Lathyris_, and not to the _Cici_. Indeed Mesue jumbles together his\r\ndescription of these two substances. (l. c.) We have mentioned already\r\nthat the _Oleum Cicinum_ or _Castor-oil_, was used as a purgative by the\r\nancient physicians. Dr. Hill says of it, “the ancients obtained an oil by\r\nexpression, and also by boiling, from the seeds; they called it _Oleum\r\nCicinum_; they used it, for burning in their lamps, and in some of their\r\nointments and plasters. Dioscorides commends it internally against worms;\r\nand Piso tells us that it is sometimes used in the same manner in the\r\nBrazils, with success.”\r\n\r\n\r\nΚιννάβαρις,\r\n\r\nCinnabaris, _Sanguis Draconis_, is possessed of moderately acrid powers\r\nwith some astringency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We must refer to what we have stated in another work, which\r\nwe have already often quoted, for the general literature of this subject.\r\nIt will be sufficient in this place to state that the substance here\r\ntreated of under the name of Cinnabaris is indisputably the _Sanguis\r\nDraconis_, or concrete juice of the _Dracœna Draco_. This is obvious\r\nfrom Dioscorides’s description of it, who says that it is of a deep\r\ncolour, and hence some had thought it the blood of the dragon. (v, 109.)\r\nSee further, Pliny (H. N. xxxiii, 38), and the very interesting note of\r\nHarduin, in which the origin of the confusion of the dragon’s blood with\r\ncinnabar is fully explained. Serapion treats of the _Sanguis Draconis_ as\r\nthe production of a tree, and quotes a description of it from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. What vegetable substance in their Mat. Med. Serapion refers\r\nto, we are at a loss to decide. One of his authorities, Constantinus,\r\ncalls it the juice of a plant, possessed of styptic powers, and therefore\r\nused as an astringent both internally as a suppository, and externally\r\nwhen so applied. (De Simpl. 341.) Avicenna recommends it similarly,\r\nbut gives no description of it. (ii, 2, 627.) It is to be borne in\r\nmind that besides the vegetable cinnabar, the ancients described two\r\nother substances under this name, viz., the native mineral cinnabar or\r\nsulphuret of quicksilver, and a factitious cinnabar, which was their Sal\r\nAtticum. See Hill (Mat. Med. 60), and Geoffroy (215.) The dragon’s blood\r\nis retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, where it is set down as the\r\nproduct of the _Calamus Draco_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚιννάμωνον,\r\n\r\nCinnamomum, _Cinnamon_, is composed of extremely subtile parts, yet is\r\nnot extremely heating, but only in the third degree. But of those in the\r\nsame rank of calefacients none is so desiccative owing to the tenuity of\r\nits parts. The cinnamomis is a sort of weak cinnamon; but some call it\r\npseudo-cinnamomum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel and Dierbach acknowledge it as the _Laurus\r\nCinnamomus_. We have stated, however, under Cassia that Stackhouse\r\nis of opinion that the ancients were unacquainted with our _Laurus\r\nCinnamomus_; but we see no good grounds for this opinion. We shall give\r\nthe words of Sprengel: “Cassia lignea nostratum et cassia cinnamomea\r\neadem esse videntur, unde et cassiam ipsam ex eadem arbore provenire,\r\nquæ cinnamomum largiatur, veteres jam statuerunt.” (ad Dioscor. i, 13.)\r\nDioscorides recommends cinnamon in uterine affections, that is to say,\r\nfor promoting the flow of the menses and for the expulsion of the fœtus.\r\nWe need scarcely mention that this use of it has been revived of late.\r\nHe also holds it to be alexipharmic, recommends it in coughs, dropsies,\r\nand diseases of the kidneys and bladder; in complaints of the eyes,\r\nand in the formation of elegant ointments; in short, he adds, it is a\r\nmedicine much in use. (i, 13.) Galen and the other Greek authorities\r\ngive its medicinal characters in more general terms. The Arabians treat\r\nof it at great length, and more especially Avicenna, who recommends it\r\nin the same cases as Dioscorides, namely, as a diuretic, emmenagogue,\r\nand alexipharmic medicine, and also as a stomachic and deobstruent in\r\ncongestion of the liver. He also holds it to be cordial and expectorant.\r\n(ii, 2, 124.) Serapion professes to borrow his account of cinnamon from\r\nDioscorides and Galen; but the extract which he gives from the latter,\r\nis not to be found in his works as they now exist. In it cinnamon is\r\ncommended as being an aromatic medicine, applicable in complaints of the\r\nstomach and liver, in affections of the eyes, and as an emmenagogue and\r\ndiuretic. (De Simpl. 266.) Rhases copies from Dioscorides, Galen, and our\r\nauthor. (Cont. l. ult. i, 213.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚιρκέα,\r\n\r\nCircea, _Enchanter’s Nightshade_; its root, which is desiccative and\r\nfragrant, when drunk with wine, cleanses the uterus. Its fruit, when\r\ntaken in gruel, promotes the formation of milk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The commentators are much divided respecting it. Sprengel\r\ninclines to the _Cynanchus niger_. Lobelius took it to be the _Solanum\r\nDulcamara_. One thing is certain, that it was quite different from any\r\nknown species of the modern genus _Circæa_. See Parkinson (351.) Both\r\nGalen and our author, in treating of it, borrow from Dioscorides, the\r\nformer of these professedly. We have not been able to detect it in the\r\nMat. Med. of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚίσσηρις,\r\n\r\nPumex, _the Pumice-stone_, is detergent, and more particularly of the\r\nteeth, not only in power, but also by its asperity. It is also joined to\r\nthe medicines used for the incarnation of ulcers, and to the abstergent\r\nplasters applied to the skin. If burnt, its parts became finer, but it is\r\nthen pungent; but if washed it lays aside its pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it was Pumice. Pumice, according\r\nto the latest analysis, is found to contain silica, argil, magnesia,\r\nsoda, oxyd of manganese, and some water. For an account of it, see Pliny\r\n(H. N. xxxvi, 42.) He recommends it in diseases of the eyes. It appears\r\nevident, however, that he had copied from his contemporary, to whom he\r\nis so frequently indebted, we mean Dioscorides, who gives a similar\r\ndescription of pumice, and also recommends it in diseases of the eyes,\r\nmore especially in opacity of the cornea, and likewise as an ingredient\r\nin applications to sores, and as a dentifrice. (v, 124.) Galen, after\r\nsome preliminary discussion whether pumice be a metal, a stone, or an\r\nearth, proceeds to state its medicinal properties, in which he agrees\r\nwith Dioscorides, most especially commending it as a dentifrice. (De\r\nSimpl. ix.) We may just mention in this place that modern authorities\r\ndo not think so highly of this substance as a dentifrice. See Jameson’s\r\n‘Mineral.’ (i, 333.) The Arabians under this head merely copy from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. See in particular Serapion (De Simpl. 417.) Pumice\r\nanciently was used for polishing the leather with which books were bound.\r\n(Catullus, Epig. i.) Theophrastus (De Lapidibus), states that pumice\r\nis formed by the action of fire; and M. Dolomieu suspects that it is a\r\nvitrified granite or gneiss. The pumice, for some time past, has ceased\r\nto hold a place in our Dispensatory. Neither is it to be found in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚιστὸς ἤ Κίσσαρος,\r\n\r\nCistus, _Rock-rose_; it is an astringent shrub, and of gently cooling\r\npowers. Its leaves and shoots are so desiccative as to agglutinate\r\nwounds; but the flowers are of a more drying nature, being about the\r\nsecond degree, and hence when drunk they cure dysenteries and all kind of\r\nfluxes. Externally they relieve putrid ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Stackhouse marks it simply as the _Cistus_, L., called by\r\nMiller the _Rock-rose_ (Index to Theophrastus.) Woodville calls it the\r\n_C. Creticus_ (Medical Botany.) Dioscorides describes two species of\r\nit, which probably are the _C. salvifolius_ and _C. villosus_. Galen\r\nparticularly commends the former in uterine diseases. He also treats\r\nunder this name of a much more celebrated species of the cistus, namely,\r\nthe _Ladaniferus_, of which we will have to give some account under\r\nΛάδανον. Aëtius and Oribasius are the copyists of Galen. The Arabians\r\ntreat separately of the _Cistus_ and _Ladanum_, recommending the former\r\nas a powerful astringent, both in external ulcers and in those of the\r\nintestines and womb. Avicenna speaks favorably of it in deafness and\r\nother affections of the ear. (ii, 2, 111.) Serapion would appear to\r\nhave confounded it with the κισσὸς (ivy); or at least he has given a\r\nvery confused account of it in his chapter on the Ivy. (De Simpl. 41,\r\n42.) Rhases does not appear to notice it separately from the _Landanum_\r\n(Ladanum) (Cont. l. ult. iii, 67.) The two species of cistus treated\r\nof under this head have long ceased to hold a place in our modern\r\nDispensatories.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚισσὸς,\r\n\r\nHedera, _Ivy_, is composed of opposite powers, for it is astringent and\r\ncooling, and acrid and hot; consisting of a watery and tepid ingredient\r\nwhen green. Its leaves, when boiled with wine, are agglutinative of\r\nwounds and relieve burns and splenic affections. Its juice is an errhine,\r\nand cures chronic defluxions from the ear. Its tears, being more acrid,\r\nkill lice and act as a depilatory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We need have no hesitation in referring it with the best\r\nauthorities to the _Hedera Helix_, L. Dioscorides describes three\r\nvarieties of it, the white, the black, and the helix; but it is easy to\r\nsee that they are all varieties of the same species. His distinctions,\r\nhowever, occasioned great trouble and confusion both to his Arabian\r\ncopyists and to the modern herbalists. See Serapion (De Simpl. 41), and\r\nParkinson (Theatre of Plants, 680), and Gerard (History of Plants, 857.)\r\nOur author’s account of its medicinal properties is taken from Galen.\r\nThe tears of it, mentioned by Dioscorides and our author, were evidently\r\nits resin, now generally known by the name of gum ivy. All the ancient\r\nwriters recommend it for thinning the hair and killing lice.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚίτριον,\r\n\r\nCitrium, _Citron_, called also Malum Medicum; its middle part is acid\r\nor devoid of qualities; but the part in which the seed is contained\r\nbelongs to the third rank of cooling and desiccative medicines. The bark\r\nis desiccative in the second degree, but not cooling, for it is acrid.\r\nIts flesh engenders thick chyme, is phlegmatic and cold. Its seed is\r\ndiscutient and desiccative in the second degree; and the leaves of the\r\ntree are possessed of desiccative and discutient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt, as Sprengel states, it is the _Malus Medica_,\r\nL., or Citron. Most of the commentators on Virgil agree that it is his\r\n“felix malum” (Georg, ii, 127.) Dr. Paris remarks that it probably\r\ndeserves the praises bestowed on it by him as an antidote to poisons\r\n(Pharmacol. 254); and on this head there is a very interesting dispute\r\nbetween the celebrated Fr. Hoffmann and Moses Charras, the famous\r\nFrench authority on the Pharmacopœia. See Pharm. (ii, 39.) According to\r\nMacrobius, it is the θύον of Homer, who mentions it in the following line:\r\n\r\n    θύον ἄνα νῆσον ὀδώδει.—_Odyss._ v.\r\n\r\nPliny, however, is not of this opinion (H. N. xiii, 16.) Our author\r\ncopies closely from Galen. Dioscorides’s account of its medicinal\r\nproperties is far more precise and interesting. Citrons, he says, when\r\ndrunk with wine, counteract the operation of deadly poisons, and loosen\r\nthe belly; the decoction is a gargle for occasioning sweetness of the\r\nbreath; its juice is much used by women labouring under pica (see Book\r\nI, 1, of this work), and their seeds seem to preserve clothes in a\r\nchest from being moth-eaten. (i, 166.) The Arabians treat very fully of\r\nthe medicinal properties of the citron. See Serapion (De Simpl. i, 1),\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 116), and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 219.) They all agree\r\nthat its seed is alexipharmic, both when taken in hot water, and when the\r\njuice is applied to a poisoned wound. See particularly Avicenna (De Med.\r\nCord. ii.) They also hold that it is an excellent cordial and stomachic;\r\nthat it stops bilious purgings, fluxes, and vomiting; and that it dispels\r\nsorrow. They hold, however, that it is prejudicial to the lungs and\r\nnerves. They speak highly of the oil of citrons in paralysis and other\r\naffections of the nerves. We need scarcely remark that this preparation\r\nhas been much celebrated in modern times (see Charras, l. c.), and is\r\nstill retained in our Pharmacopœia. See Pereira, 1235.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚιχόριον ἤ πικρὶς,\r\n\r\nCichorium, _Succory_, is, as it were, a wild endive, being cooling and\r\ndesiccant in the first degree. It has also some astringency, and hence it\r\nagrees with hepatic dysenteries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Cichorium Intybus_. We have treated of it among\r\nthe pot-herbs in the First Book. It occurs in the Flora Hippocratica.\r\nDioscorides recommends both the garden and the wild succory as being\r\nastringent, cooling, and stomachic, in various cases, both internally\r\nand externally, for binding the bowels in dysentery, as a cataplasm in\r\ncardiac affection, and as a remedy for gout and ophthalmy. (ii, 159.)\r\nCelsus also ranks the intybus and ambubeia, which are the wild and\r\ngarden succory, with astringents. (ii, 30.) Galen and the other Greek\r\nauthorities give it the same general characters. The Arabians treat of\r\nthe seris and intybus at greater length, and seem to confound the latter,\r\nor endive, with the taraxacon (Leontodon taraxacum?). See in particular\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 229, 683.) He recommends the latter most particularly\r\nas a deobstruent in obstructions of the liver and other viscera; he\r\nspeaks favorably of it as a plaster in palpitations of the heart, and as\r\na gargle along with Cassia fistula in inflammations of the throat. All\r\nthe Arabians recommend both species as antidotes to the bites of venomous\r\nanimals. See Avicenna (l. c.), Serapion (c. 143), and Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 266.) The wild succory (Cichorium Intybus) is still sometimes\r\nemployed in medicine. Dr. Pereira says, “the medicinal properties of\r\n_Cichorium Intybus_ are analogous to those of Taraxacum Densleonis.”\r\n(Mat. Med. 698.) It occurs in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚλήματις,\r\n\r\nClematis, _Virgin’s-bower_, (called also Myrsonöides, Daphnöides,\r\nand Polygonöides,) has twigs as long as the thickness of a May-rush,\r\n(holoschænus,) and petals like the bay, and is of a desiccant nature; it,\r\ntherefore, stops diarrhœas, dysenteries, and pains of the teeth, and is\r\nuseful for the bites of venomous animals. The other species of clematis\r\ntwines around trees like ivy, being of an acrid and caustic nature. Its\r\nfruit, when drunk with water, evacuates bile and phlegm downwards; and\r\nits leaves in a cataplasm, remove leprosy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The former species, distinguished by the synonyme of\r\nDaphnöides, is the clematis described by Dioscorides (iv, 179), and is\r\nthe second species of Galen, who expresses himself contemptuously of\r\nPamphilus for confounding the two species together. It is clearly a\r\nspecies of _Clematis_, either the _vitalba_ or _cirrhosa_. All agree\r\nin recommending it as a safe astringent. The other species described\r\nby Dioscorides (iv, 7), and which is the former species of Galen, may\r\nbe decidedly determined to be either the _Vinca major_ or _minor_.\r\nIt, according to Galen, is possessed of acrid and caustic powers. The\r\nArabians would appear not to distinguish properly the _clematis_ from the\r\n_hedera_. See Serapion (c. 41), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 169.) The modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia contains the _C. erecta_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚλινοπόδιον,\r\n\r\nClinopodium, _Field Basil_, is possessed of heating and desiccative\r\npowers, not caustic however, but of the third degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It may with considerable confidence be set down as being the\r\n_Clinopodium vulgare_, although doubts have been started on this head.\r\nSee Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 23), and Sprengel (Ad Dioscorid.)\r\nOur author follows Galen very closely. Dioscorides represents it to be\r\ndiuretic and emmenagogue (iii, 99.) We have not been able to discover any\r\ntraces of it in the Mat. Med. of the Arabians, nor in Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚνίκος,\r\n\r\nCnicus, _Bastard Saffron_; its seed is used only for purgings, but if\r\napplied externally it belongs to the third order of calefacients.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The preponderance of authority is decidedly in favour of\r\nits being the _Carthamus tinctorius_, a plant which held a place in\r\nour Dispensatory with its ancient characters down to recent date. (See\r\nQuincy, 167.) Dioscorides mentions of it that it is used as a potherb,\r\nand as a medicine for opening the bowels. Galen gives it exactly the same\r\ncharacter as our author. The Arabians give rather a confused account of\r\nit by treating of it along with _Atractylis_, which they held to be the\r\nwild cnicus. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 159.) All the Arabians\r\nhold that it is not only laxative, but also powerfully alexipharmic. They\r\ncall it _Kartam_ or _Cartamus_. See further Serapion (c. 202), and Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. iii, 46.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚογχύλια,\r\n\r\nConchylia; their powers resemble those of the buccinæ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This name was applied to various Testacea, or _Shell-fish_.\r\nSee Harduin (Ad Plinii H. N. ix, 60); Athenæi Deipnos, iii; Aristotle,\r\nH. A. v, 14; and Gesner, De Aquat. Oysters are frequently called by this\r\nname, as in the following lines of Petronius Arbiter:\r\n\r\n                              Lucrinis\r\n    Eruta littoribus vendunt Conchylia, cænis\r\n    Ut renovent per damna famem.—_Satyricon._\r\n\r\nDioscorides does not treat of this article, at least, under this name.\r\nThe Arabians would appear to have identified them with the _Cochleæ_. See\r\nin particular Serapion (c. 434.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚοιλία,\r\n\r\nVenter, _the Belly_ of the cormorant, either when boiled, fresh, or\r\ndried, is said to be stomachic if eaten; and in like manner, the inner\r\ncoat of the stomach of hens when dried and taken in a draught. But Galen\r\nsays, that he found upon trial both these statements false. Dioscorides\r\nrelates that the stomach of a wood-pigeon, if drunk, gradually makes\r\nstones be expelled by urine. The stomach of a weasel, when drunk, is a\r\npreservative against all poisonous animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Properly speaking _the Stomach_. Our author, as he\r\nacknowledges, borrows from Galen and Dioscorides. Serapion repeats the\r\nsame characters of this article upon the authority of Dioscorides. (c.\r\n469.) We may be allowed to mention that the inner membrane of the crop of\r\na fowl is still a popular remedy for indigestion in the north of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόκκος κνίδιος,\r\n\r\nGranum Gnidium, is the fruit of the Thymelæa and not of the Chamelæa as\r\nsome have supposed. Being possessed of acrid and caustic powers, when\r\ndrunk, it purges water downwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See under Θυμέλαια. All the authorities, from Hipprocrates\r\ndownwards, describe it as an acrid purgative. Dr. Pereira says, “_Daphne\r\nGnidium_ is the _Thymelæa_ of Dioscorides, whose fruit is the κόκκος\r\nκνίδιος, or _Gnidian-berry_, used by Hippocrates. Its properties are\r\nsimilar to those of D. Mezereum.” (Mat. Med. 807.) Dioscorides gives a\r\nfull description of the thymelæa, and states, with excellent precision,\r\nits operation on the animal economy. He says it purges, bringing away a\r\nwatery discharge, and kills the fœtus in utero when applied on a pessary.\r\n(iv, 170.) Galen and Aëtius and Oribasius state its characters in brief\r\nterms, like our author. It would appear, in fact, to have been little\r\nused in medicine. The Arabians confound the thymelæa, chamelæa, and\r\nchamæleon together, so that there is great difficulty in making out what\r\nwere their exact views on the _Thymelaceæ_. Indeed, the genera of this\r\ntribe of plants are still with difficulty distinguished from one another.\r\nSee Lindley’s Vegetable Kingdom, 530.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόκκος βαφικὸς,\r\n\r\nGranum tinctorium, is desiccative without pungency. It agrees, therefore,\r\nwith large wounds and wounds of the nerves when triturated with vinegar\r\nor oxymel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is _Vermilion_ or _Scarlet grain_, being the product of\r\na little hemopterous insect called _kermes_ or _Coccus ilicis_. See\r\nTheophrastus (H. P. iii, 16), and Pliny (H. N. xvi, 12.) It was anciently\r\nused in dyeing, but is now superseded by the cochineal. An interesting\r\naccount of kermes and cochineal is given by Beckmann. (History of\r\nInventions.) Dioscorides and the other authorities, like Paulus, commend\r\nit as a vulnerary medicine, especially in wounds of the nerves. The\r\nArabians, in treating of the kermes, merely repeat what Dioscorides and\r\nGalen had written on this head. See in particular Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n321); Avicenna (ii, 2, 718); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 740.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚοκκομηλέα,\r\n\r\nPrunus, _the Plum_; its fruit loosens the belly, if fresh, in a greater\r\ndegree, or if dried, in a smaller. The decoction of it in gargles, cures\r\ninflammations about the uvula. The gum of the tree has the powers of an\r\nincisive and attenuate substance, so that some relate that when drunk\r\nwith wine it proves lithontriptic. With vinegar it is said to cure the\r\nlichen of children. The fruit of the wild plums is manifestly astringent,\r\nand constipates the belly. This plant in Asia is called _Prumnum_. The\r\ndried garden plums, now called damascenes, appear to be similar, as Galen\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Prunus insiticia_ or _Bullace tree_,\r\na well known species of plum. The _Damask-plums_ are much celebrated by\r\nancient authors. We have treated of plums as an article of food in the\r\nFirst Book. Pliny and Marcellus Empiricus recommend them particularly\r\nin diseases of the tonsils and gums; but, indeed, all the ancient\r\nauthorities prescribe them as astringents in such cases. There is a\r\nslight difference of opinion between Dioscorides and Galen regarding\r\nthe virtues of the plum. Dioscorides says, “the fruit is esculent, but\r\nbad for the stomach, and loosens the bowels. But the dried fruit of\r\nthe Syrian plums, and more especially those which grow about Damascus\r\n(damascenes?), are stomachic and astringent of the bowels.” Galen says,\r\n“the fruit of the plum tree loosens the bowels, the fresh in a greater\r\ndegree and the dried in a less. I know not how it is that Dioscorides\r\nsays that the dried damask-plums bind the bowels, for even these\r\nmanifestly loosen, but in a less degree than the Spanish; for the damask\r\nare more astringent, and the Spanish more sweet, &c.” (De Simpl. vii.)\r\nThis slight difference created a keen controversy in modern times between\r\nBrasavolus, who impugns, and Matthiolus, who defends the strictures of\r\nGalen. To us it appears that the only mistake committed by Dioscorides\r\nconsists in stating his views too succinctly. He, no doubt, never meant\r\nto deny that the damask-plums have a certain purgative faculty mixed\r\nup with astringency, like plums in general. Galen’s language is more\r\nprecise, but we do not see that there is much real difference between his\r\nviews and those of Dioscorides. The Arabians gravely state this mighty\r\ncontroversy between the two ancient sages, but scarcely pretend “tantas\r\ncomponere lites.” See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 565); Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n532); and Serapion (c. 139.) One of Rhases’s authorities says of plums,\r\nthat they moisten the stomach and loosen the belly, purging yellow bile.\r\nAnother of them, named Chuz, says the water of them is emmenagogue, and\r\ntheir gum, mixed with sugar, cures impetigo. Avicenna quotes this opinion\r\nwith approbation. All agree that they are lithontriptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόλλα,\r\n\r\nGluten, _Glue_; that prepared from the similago and pollen is of an\r\nemplastic and digestive nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Gluten_ or _Paste_. Dioscorides mentions that the best kind\r\nis prepared from the hides of bulls in Rhodes. Galen makes mention of\r\nanother kind prepared from flour, and used in binding books. (De Simpl.\r\nvii.) See further, Pliny (H. N. xiii, 26.) The Arabians, in treating of\r\nit, derive most of their information from the Greeks. See Serapion (c.\r\n138); Avicenna (ii, 2, 202); and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 336.) They\r\ntreat of the ichthyocolla under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚολοκύνθη,\r\n\r\nCucurbita, _the Gourd_, is of a humid and cold temperament in the\r\nsecond degree. Hence, when applied entire in a cataplasm, it cools hot\r\ninflammations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have stated the difficulty of determining this article in\r\nthe chapter of the First Book on the summer fruits. It would appear to\r\nbe sometimes put for the _Cucumis sativus_ or _Cucumber_, and sometimes\r\nfor the _Cucurbita_ or _Gourd_. About the species, however, there is some\r\ndoubt. On its medicinal properties, besides the medical authorities,\r\nsee Geopon. (xii, 19.) Dioscorides recommends it raw, as a cooling\r\napplication for various swellings and apostemes; also for the siriasis\r\nof infancy (See Book I, 13), for inflammations of the eyes, and those of\r\ngout in like manner. He also speaks of it as being useful in earache and\r\nheat of the stomach. He states that it is laxative of the bowels; and\r\nfor this purpose directs a raw gourd to be hollowed out, and wine having\r\nbeen poured into it, it is to be exposed for a time to the heat of the\r\nsun, when it will become gently laxative. (ii, 161.) Galen, Aëtius, and\r\nothers give it much the same characters as our author. The Arabians, as\r\nusual, borrow freely from the Greeks without making any addition of much\r\nconsequence. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 175); Serapion (c. 248); and Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. 1, 344.) One of Serapion’s authorities, called Masarugie,\r\nsays of the gourd, that when it is surrounded with paste and roasted,\r\nthe water thus squeezed out of it is beneficial in acute diseases and\r\ncough, that it quenches thirst, and when taken with sugar gently opens\r\nthe bowels. Another of them, Habix, gives nearly the same account of it.\r\nAnother of them says of its seed, that it is diuretic, and softens the\r\nbelly. In modern times the seeds of gourd were formerly held as one of\r\nthe four greater cold seeds. See Charras (Roy. Pharm. 66) and Quincy (p.\r\n197.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚολοκινθίς,\r\n\r\nCucurbita sylvestris, _Colocynth_, is possessed of a strong purgative\r\npower. If the juice of it, while in a green state, be rubbed into the\r\npart, it relieves ischiatic disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Cucumis Colocynthis_,\r\n_Coloquintida_, or _Bitter Gourd_. It was used in medicine from the\r\nearliest times, being the κολοκύνθη ἀγρία of Hippocrates (De Mulieb.\r\n621, ed. Föes), as Galen has explained. It does not occur, however,\r\nin the works of Celsus. Dioscorides gives an excellent account of it,\r\nrecommending it as a powerful phlegmagogue and cholagogue, both when\r\ngiven by the mouth and in clysters; and as a gargle in toothache. He\r\nsays it kills the fœtus _in utero_ when applied on a pessary. (iv, 175.)\r\nOur author’s account of it is copied from Galen. The Arabians treat\r\nof it more fully. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 127); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n222); Serapion (c. 272); Mesue (De Simpl. 4); Averrhoes (Collig. v,\r\n421); and Ebn Baithar (i, 331.) Avicenna is very precise in giving\r\ndirections for the preparation of the medicine. His statement of its\r\nmedicinal properties is so long that we cannot find room for it. He says\r\nit evacuates phlegm, bile, and perhaps blood from the intestines; that\r\nit is useful in dropsy, and that it is alexipharmic, in proof of which\r\nhe refers to the report of a case of a person who had been stung by\r\nscorpions, and was immediately cured by it. But of all the authorities,\r\nMesue is, perhaps, the one who treats of it most elaborately: he\r\nrecommends it as purging phlegm and yellow bile, in cephalæa, hemicrania,\r\nepilepsy, apoplexy, vertigo, defluxion in the eyes, cold gout, and other\r\naffections of the joints; asthma, chronic cough, dyspnœa, &c. But, he\r\nadds, it is more especially useful in pituitous and flatulent colic,\r\nand in dropsy. For this purpose it may be administered by the mouth,\r\nin clysters and in suppositories. Applied _per vaginam_ it kills the\r\nfœtus. He directs its bad effects to be corrected by means of mastich,\r\ntragacanth, &c. He forbids it to be administered either in great heat or\r\ncold. Averrhoes ranks it with the strongest phlegmagogues, and recommends\r\nthat its activity should be abated by almonds, tragacanth, fistics, &c.\r\nEbn Baithar treats of it at very great length. Serapion says that, being\r\na drastic purgative, it ought not to be given during the heat of summer,\r\nor cold of winter; for that, at these seasons, Hippocrates had forbid to\r\nadminister purgatives. Pliny recommends it in injections for diseases\r\nof the intestines, kidneys, and loins. He says that an embrocation of\r\nit with oil cures pains of the spine and hip-joint, and is useful in\r\njaundice when followed by oxymel. (H. N. xx, 7, 8.) Marcellus, the\r\nEmpiric, says of it that it purges phlegm, yellow and black bile, when\r\ngiven with oxymel. (c. 30.) Ruffus Ephesius says of colocynth, that it\r\npurges phlegm and pure bile: in a word, he adds, it is useful in asthma,\r\npleurisy, chronic headache, vertigo, and dimness of vision. (De Med.\r\nPurg.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόμαρος,\r\n\r\nArbutus, _the Arbute Tree_, is of a sour quality, both the tree and its\r\nfruit, which is called memycœlon. It is hurtful to the stomach, and\r\noccasions headache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Apuleius says “Comaron Græci, Romani fragum vocant.” It\r\nis the _Arbutus Unedo_ or _Wild Strawberry Tree_, which must not be\r\nconfounded with the _Fragaria vesca_, L., Angl., Wood Strawberry. It\r\nseems difficult to account for its holding a place in the ancient Materia\r\nMedica, since all the authorities, like Paulus, speak unfavorably of its\r\nmedicinal powers. See Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόμμι,\r\n\r\nGummi, _Gum_, is of a desiccative and emplastic nature, and manifestly\r\ncures asperities (hoarseness?).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For an account of the ancient gums see Pliny (H. N. xiii,\r\n20.) He says the best kind is got from the Egyptian thorn or Acacia; this\r\nmust have been either the _Acacia vera_, L., or _Acacia Senegal_. Galen\r\ndelivers the medicinal character of gum in the same terms as our author,\r\nand the other Greek authorities do the same. Dioscorides recommends the\r\ngum of the acacia (gum-arabic?) as possessing emplastic powers, and for\r\nblunting acrid medicines when mixed with them. He adds that, when mixed\r\nwith the white of an egg, it prevents blisters from rising on burnt\r\nparts. (i, 133.) The Arabians concur in recommending gum-arabic as being\r\nbeneficial in hot coughs, in ulcers of the lungs, and for clearing the\r\nvoice; they also held it to be stomachic and theriacal. See Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 310); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 345); and Serapion (c. 229.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚονία,\r\n\r\nLixivium, _Lye_; the washings, as it were, of ashes are so named. The\r\nmost detergent and desiccative of all are those made from the ashes of\r\nfigs and of the spurges, so that they are possessed of almost septic\r\npowers. If a little quicklime be added to the ashes it renders the lye\r\ncaustic, which is then called protostactos, being mixed up principally\r\nwith medicines administered by injection. But the strongest of all is\r\nthat prepared from quicklime alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have given some account of the _Lixivial Ashes_ or _Lyes_\r\nof the ancients in the 9th section of Book VI. They were all of them\r\npreparations of potass mixed up with various impurities. The term was\r\napplied not only to the solution, but also to the dried _cineres_ of the\r\nsame. Even quicklime is sometimes called by this name: κονία ἢ ἄσβεστος.\r\n(Scholiastes in Theocrit. Idyll. i.) The Cinis lixivius of the fig-tree\r\nis the one most frequently mentioned of them. See Pliny (H. N. xv, 18);\r\nGeopon. (v, 33); Dioscorides (i, 186); Serapion (183); and Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 188.) Avicenna recommends the lye of the mezerion in quinsy\r\nand affections of the eye. See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 214.) The\r\nprotostactos was a composition of potass and lime. (See Book VI, s. 9.)\r\nOn the alkalies or Cineres lixivii of the ancients, see further, Dutens\r\n(Découvertes attrib. aux Modern. 187.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόνυζα,\r\n\r\nConyza, _Fleabane_; both species of it are desiccant and calefacient\r\nin the third degree. Hence, even the oil in which it is boiled stops\r\nperiodical rigors; and the flowers have similar powers. The decoction of\r\nthem promotes menstruation, and expels the fœtus. That which grows in\r\nmoist situations is more fetid and has weaker powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is considerable difficulty in determining exactly the\r\nconyzæ of the ancients. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, i, 44), and\r\nSprengel (Ad Dioscor. iii, 126.) The preponderance of authority seems to\r\nlead to the conclusion that they all were species of _Inula_, namely, the\r\ngreater _I. viscosa_, Act., the lesser _Inula saxatilis_, and the third,\r\n_I. oculus Christi_. The conyzæ were employed in medicine at a very early\r\nperiod, being frequently mentioned in the Hippocratic treatises. See\r\nDierbach, who, however, has decided differently from us as to the plants\r\nto which the conyzæ are referable. He marks the fetid conyza as being\r\n_Ambrosia maritima_, and the fragrant as _Inula bifrons_. The greater\r\nconyza of Dioscorides would appear to be the cunilago of Pliny (H. N.,\r\nxx, 63), where see the note of Harduin. Our author follows Dioscorides\r\nand Galen, who agree in the main as to the medicinal properties of these\r\nplants. All the authorities concur in opinion that the greater conyza\r\nis emmenagogue, and procures abortion in pessaries. Ebn Baithar seems\r\nto treat of it rather confusedly under the head of _Thuback_. (ii,\r\n150.) Few, if any, of the other Arabians have noticed it; and it is not\r\ncontained in the Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόπρος,\r\n\r\nStercus, _Dung_; all kinds of it are of a heating, desiccative, and\r\ndiscutient nature, but they differ from one another according to the\r\ntemperament and diet of the animal which voids it. The dung, then, of\r\ndogs fed on bones, when dried, cures dysenteric affections if taken in a\r\ndraught with divided milk (lac scissum), and old ulcers, if mixed with\r\nsuitable medicines. In cynanche and inflammations about the tonsils, it\r\nis rubbed into the parts mixed with honey. These complaints are greatly\r\nrelieved by the dung of children who have not been permitted to take too\r\nmuch food. The dung of wolves and the whiter sort which is found upon\r\ncertain shrubs, is an admirable remedy for colics, and that, not only\r\nin a draught, but also when appended as an amulet. It may be fastened\r\neither with the wool of a sheep recently killed by a wolf, or the skin\r\nof a stag. Goat’s dung, being more acrid and discutient, discusses\r\nscirrhous tumours when applied externally, more especially upon hard\r\nflesh. When burnt it is more detergent and attenuate. The dung of oxen\r\nhas some attractive powers, and, therefore, cures the stings of wasps and\r\nbees. And if the whole body of persons affected with dropsy be rubbed\r\nwith cow’s dung in the sun they will be much relieved thereby. Sheep’s\r\ndung with vinegar cures myrmecia, acrochordon, furunculus, and clavus.\r\nThat of wild pigeons, being much more acrid than the other kinds, proves\r\nrubefacient when applied with the seed of cardamus. That of domestic\r\nfowls, when drunk with oxymel, vinegar, or wine and honey, causes the\r\nsuffocative mushrooms to be vomited, and proves a preservative from them.\r\nSome have given it to drink also in colics. They say also that the dung\r\nof storks, when drunk, is useful in orthopnœa. That of mice, being more\r\ndetergent than all others, agrees with alopecia, and when applied to the\r\nanus of children provokes evacuation. The dung of starlings, when they\r\nfeed on rice, becomes detergent so as to clear away freckles. That of\r\nland crocodiles removes alphos, as that of the crocodiles of the Nile is\r\nbelieved to attenuate leucoma (white films on the eyes).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _Dung_\r\nis abridged from Galen. As we have no wish to see this article restored\r\nto the Materia Medica, we shall not enlarge upon the subject. Those who\r\nwish to improve their knowledge of the medicinal articles mentioned under\r\nthis head by our author, may find them treated of _usque ad nauseam_ by\r\nDioscorides, Galen, Serapion, and Avicenna. Many of them were retained in\r\nthe Dispensatory down to a comparatively recent date. For example, the\r\nwhite dung of dogs, usually called _Album Græcum_, was long used in the\r\ncure of quinsies. See Quincy (140, 206.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚοράλλιον,\r\n\r\nCorallium, _Coral_, is a sort of petrified arboret, not growing on dry\r\nland, but among the mud of the sea, being of a red colour, and like\r\nstone. Its powers are decidedly desiccant and moderately astringent. It\r\nanswers, therefore, with cases of hæmoptysis and dysentery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Coral of the ancients is the _Isis nobilis_, Pall.; the\r\nname Isis being borrowed from Pliny. (H. N. xiii, 52.) Pliny mentions,\r\nin another place, that corals, burnt and pulverised, and drunk in water,\r\nare useful in some pains of the bowels and bladder, and in calculus.\r\nHe adds that they are also soporific. Corals were much used as amulets\r\nor phylacteries. (H. N. xxxii, 5.) See also Solinus (ii), and Geopon.\r\n(xv, 1.) Celsus ranks the corallium with those substances which burn:\r\n“Veratrum, album et nigrum, corallium, cantharides, pyrethrum, adurunt.”\r\n(v, 208.) This article does not occur in the Hippocratic treatises, nor\r\nin Galen’s work ‘On the Faculties of Simples.’ The latter, however,\r\nprescribes it for spitting of blood in another place. (De Comp. Med.\r\nsec. loc. vii.) Dioscorides and Serapion, likewise, recommend it as an\r\nastringent in hæmoptysis and in dysentery. It appears from the Royal\r\nPharmacopœia of Moses Charras, that it was used for the cure of these\r\ncomplaints in his time. He prefers the red coral, and directs us to\r\ngive it in the form of an impalpable powder. The red coral held a place\r\nin our English Dispensatory until a recent date. See Quincy (101.) It\r\nwas much used in infantile convulsions. It is still admitted to be a\r\ngood antacid. See Gray (Pharmacol. 146.) According to Dr. Ainslie, the\r\nTamool practitioners prescribe it, when calcined, in cases of diabetes\r\nand bleeding piles. The Arabians place it among their astringents and\r\ncordials. (Mat. Ind. 52.) The sea-coralline is retained in the modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia, under the title of _Helminthochortos_, which,\r\nhowever, as is there stated, comprehends several species of the _Ceramium\r\nhelminthochortum_, mixed up with ulvæ, confervæ, but especially red\r\ncorallines. (77.) On the use of it by the Arabians, see the commentators\r\non Mesue. (De Electariis, 89.) The Electarium de Gemmis, in which\r\nit occurs as an ingredient, is said to be most efficacious in cold\r\naffections of the brain, heart, stomach, liver, and womb; an excellent\r\nexhilarant and cordial; and restorative in palpitation of the heart, and\r\nin syncope.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόρεις,\r\n\r\nCimices, _Bugs_; these animals are of an acrid nature. Some write that\r\nwhen drunk with vinegar they eject leeches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides recommends _Bugs_ in quartan intermittents,\r\nuterine suffocation, and as an antidote to the bite of the asp. (ii, 36.)\r\nGalen properly recommends garlic as a substitute for them in the case\r\nof leeches which have been swallowed. Pliny, apparently deriving his\r\ninformation from Dioscorides, ascribes to bugs alexipharmic properties of\r\nthe most general nature; and more especially commends them as being a\r\nremedy against the bite of asps. (H. N. xxix, 17.) The Arabians copy all\r\nthat the Greeks had recorded respecting the medicinal virtues of bugs,\r\nwithout making any addition. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 270.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚορὶς,\r\n\r\nCoris, the herb; some call it Hypericum (_St. John’s Wort_). It is acrid\r\nand fragrant; but the fruit of it, in a draught, promotes the urinary\r\nand menstrual discharges. It is also a remedy for the bites of venomous\r\nspiders; and in cases of opisthotonos it is rubbed in with oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is _Hypericum Coris_. This name is taken from Pliny,\r\nwho recommends it in strangury and pleurisy. (xxvi, 54.) Our author’s\r\nstatement of its medicinal powers is abridged from Dioscorides. (iii,\r\n164.) Galen does not treat of it by name, but ascribes nearly similar\r\npowers to hypericum. We cannot find it described in the works of the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚορριαννὸν ἢ κόριον,\r\n\r\nCoriandrum, _Coriander_, is composed of opposite powers. For it consists\r\nof a terrene part formed of subtile particles, which is bitter, and of\r\na watery juice, which is tepid (mild?). It has also a small degree of\r\nastringency, so as to accord with inflammations and cases of erysipelas,\r\nwhich are not of too hot a nature; and it also discusses the softer\r\ntumours with some of the other subtile remedies. The seed, when drunk in\r\nsmall quantity with sweet wine, expels worms; but when taken in larger\r\ndoses it disturbs the understanding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It certainly is the _Coriandrum sativum_. Dioscorides says\r\nthat its action is refrigerant, but Galen insists that it is calefacient.\r\nSymeon Seth, Mesue, as quoted by Serapion, and most of the ancient\r\nauthorities adopt the opinion of Dioscorides. Our modern views would\r\nseem to correspond better with those of Galen; coriander-seed being now\r\ngenerally looked upon as an aromatic stimulant, and as being carminative\r\nand stomachic. Galen’s remarks under this head are highly interesting.\r\nThe coriander was used in the age of Hippocrates. (359, etc. ed. Föes.)\r\nCelsus, like Dioscorides, holds it to be refrigerant. (84, ed. Milligan.)\r\nHe also calls it diuretic. (Ibid.) The Arabians say that when the juice\r\nis taken to the extent of four ounces, it proves destructive of life.\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 143); Serapion (c. 44); and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n229.) They also hold that it is possessed of soporific powers. They\r\nprescribe it for the cure of epilepsy, in which case they say it checks\r\nthe aura which ascends from the stomach to the brain. The _Coriandrum\r\nsativum_ holds a place in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia. (58.) It is also\r\nstill retained in our Materia Medica. See Pereira (1073.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόρυδος ἢ Κορύδαλλος,\r\n\r\nAlauda, _the Lark_; this bird when boiled with plain broth is of use in\r\ncolic affections. But one must eat it perseveringly and frequently with\r\nthe broth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. No one can doubt, from the ancient descriptions of it,\r\nthat it was the _Alauda cristata_. Galen remarks, that it is correctly\r\ndescribed by Aristophanes, in his ‘Birds;’ and that it is noticed by\r\nTheocritus. (Idyll. vii.) It is also mentioned by Aristotle and Ælian\r\nin their works on Natural History. Pliny calls it _Galerita_. Galen\r\nsays there is a herb of the same name. Like our author, he praises it\r\nwhen given in broth, for the cure of colic. Both, however, copy from\r\nDioscorides. (ii, 59.) It is not noticed in the works of Hippocrates and\r\nCelsus. It would appear that it is the _hanabroch_ of Serapion, who, in\r\ndescribing it, merely gives extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. (436.)\r\nIt is also briefly noticed by Ebn Baithar in nearly the same terms as\r\nSerapion. (ii, 329.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚορωνόπους,\r\n\r\nCoronopus, _Buck’s-horn Plantain_; the root of it is believed to be\r\nuseful in colic affections when eaten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Plantago Coronopus_, called in English Buckshorn\r\nPlantain. See Parkinson, Gerard, and Quincy. Dioscorides says it is used\r\nas a potherb, and that it is given as a medicine in colic. (ii, 157.)\r\nNone of the others supply any additional information regarding it worth\r\nquoting.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚόστος,\r\n\r\nCostos, is possessed of a small degree of a bitter, but a greater\r\ndegree of an acrid and hot quality. Wherefore, when a part requires\r\nto be heated, or a deep-seated humour attracted to the surface, one\r\nhas recourse to the costus. It is therefore diuretic, emmenagogue, and\r\nanthelminthic. It has also some flatulent powers, so that it excites\r\nto venery when drunk with wine and honey. It suits with ischiatic and\r\nparalytic affections, and with periodical rigors when rubbed in with oil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We should occupy more space than we can afford to devote to\r\nit if we were to enter into a disquisition on the general literature\r\nof this article. Those who feel curious to know our opinions on this\r\nsubject, are referred to the Appendix to Dunbar’s Lexicon, already\r\nfrequently quoted by us. Much interesting information respecting the\r\ncostus has been supplied by very recent writers. See Royle (Ant. of\r\nHindoo Medicine, 88), Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 152), and Pereira (Mat. Med.\r\n699.) Dr. Lindley says of it, “Dr. Falconer has ascertained that the\r\ncostus of the ancients is the root of his Auklandia Costus, a plant\r\ninhabiting the moist open slopes surrounding the vale of Cashmere. In\r\nCashmere the plant is not held in repute as a medicine, but is chiefly\r\nemployed for protecting bales of shawls from the attacks of moths.”\r\n(Vegetable Kingdom, 708.) We may add, that although the zeduary be not\r\nthe same as the costus, as has been supposed, there can be no doubt that\r\nit was often used in place of the costus. (See M. Charras’ Pharm.) More\r\nrecently, we have reason to think, our costmary, _Balsamita vulgaris_,\r\nwas used as a succedaneum for the ancient costus. Compare Parkinson\r\n(80) with Hill (M. M. 624.) The three kinds of costus described by\r\nDioscorides, namely, the Arabian, the Indian, and the Syrian, would\r\nappear to have been only varieties of the same substance. He says it is\r\npossessed of calefacient, diuretic, and emmenagogue powers, and is useful\r\nin uterine affections, in pessaries, fomentations, and fumigations.\r\nHe recommends it as being alexipharmic, expectorant, aphrodisiacal,\r\nvermifuge, a good application externally in paralytic cases; and,\r\nin short, he gives it nearly the same characters as our author, who\r\nevidently copies from him and Galen. Aëtius and Oribasius do the same.\r\nThe Arabian authorities on the Mat. Med. in like manner, do little more\r\nthan quote what Dioscorides, Galen, and our author have written on\r\nthe subject. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 236); Avicenna (ii, 2, 161);\r\nSerapion (c. 318.) Avicenna and Rhases agree that it dries up humid\r\nulcers when sprinkled over them. One of Rhases’s authorities states that\r\nthe oil of costus is useful in relaxation and coldness of the nerves,\r\nand in sciatica; and that a fumigation made with it by means of an\r\ninstrument for the purpose (per embotum), kills the fœtus, and promotes\r\nmenstruation. All join in giving it the character of being alexipharmic.\r\nThe costus, as far as we have been able to discover, does not occur in\r\nthe works of Hippocrates. Celsus mentions it along with other aromatics\r\n(iv, 14, et alibi). It is often noticed as a precious ointment and\r\naromatic by the classic authors. See Pliny (H. N. xii, 24); Columella\r\n(xii, 20); Propertius (iv, 6, 5); Lucan (ix, 917); Horace (Carm. iii, 1,\r\n44); Ovid (Met. x, 308.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚοτυληδὼν,\r\n\r\nCotyledon, _Navel-wort_, is cooling, repellent, detergent, and\r\ndiscutient. It is believed that when the leaves of it are eaten along\r\nwith the root, they prove lithontriptic and diuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two species, which are the _Cotyledon\r\numbilicus_, and the _C. serrata_. Our author’s description applies to the\r\nformer of these, and is abridged from Galen. Galen further recommends it\r\nstrongly as an application to inflammatory erysipelas and erysipelatous\r\ninflammation, the nice distinction between which he has stated under\r\ncoriander, and in his work Therap. ad Glauc. (ii.) See Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 138.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚοχλίαι,\r\n\r\nCochleæ, _Snails_, when burnt are of a moderately desiccative nature,\r\nand somewhat heating. They are useful in dysenteries when mortification\r\nhas not yet taken place, if to four parts of them, one part of white\r\npepper, and two parts of galls be added. Unburnt, they are triturated and\r\napplied whole to the belly in dropsical complaints, and to the joints in\r\narthritic, with advantage, being allowed to remain until they drop off\r\nspontaneously; and upon the whole they dry strongly deep-seated humours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The κ. χἔρσᾶιος is the _Helix Pomatia_, _Escargot_,\r\nor _Vinegar Snail_. The snail was esteemed a delicacy by the Roman\r\ngourmands. See Varro (de R. R. iii, 14) and Pliny (H. N. ix, 25.) The\r\nuse of it, however, was forbidden by the Mosaic law. In one of the\r\nHippocratic treatises, the cochleæ are recommended for procidentia\r\nani. (De fistul.) Pliny, in like manner, recommends them in dysentery.\r\n(H. N. vii, 30.) Dioscorides and Galen give nearly the same account of\r\ntheir medicinal properties as our author. The latter says that they are\r\ndifficult to digest, but very nutritious when digested. Celsus, on the\r\nother hand, ranks them among the weak articles of food. Horace seems to\r\nsay that they whet the appetite.\r\n\r\n    Tostis marcentem squillis recreabis et Afrâ\r\n    Potorem cochleâ.—_Satir._\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρανέα,\r\n\r\nCornus, _the Cornel_; the fruit of the tree being sour, proves strongly\r\nastringent of the belly when eaten. The leaves and shoots, by their\r\nsourness, are strongly desiccative, so as to agglutinate the largest\r\nwounds of hard bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Cornus Mas_. Dioscorides recommends it as an\r\napplication to lichen. (ii, 72.) Our author abridges Galen’s account of\r\nit. The Arabians speak favorably of it in the same cases as the Greeks,\r\nand also recommend it for cholera, diabetes, and vomiting. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 315), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 357.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚράμβη,\r\n\r\nBrassica, _Cabbage_; that sort which is esculent has desiccative powers\r\nboth when eaten and when applied externally, but it is not sensibly\r\nacrid. It therefore agglutinates wounds and ill-conditioned ulcers,\r\nand cures tumours which are difficult to discuss. It is also somewhat\r\ndetergent, by which property it cures leprosy. Its seed when drunk kills\r\nworms, and especially the seed of the Egyptian cabbage does this. The\r\nashes of its stalks when burnt are possessed of caustic powers, and\r\nwith grease are applicable in chronic pains of the sides. The wild is\r\nstronger than the garden cabbage in all respects; hence it cannot be\r\ntaken internally without inconvenience. The sea-cabbage being saltish and\r\nbitterish loosens the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Brassica sativa of the ancients no doubt comprehended\r\nseveral species of cabbage. Dioscorides dwells largely on its medicinal\r\nproperties, but in nearly the same terms as our author. He calls it\r\nlaxative and alexipharmic, and recommends it as an application to\r\nerysipelas, epinyctis, and leprosy; with salts, he says, it breaks\r\nanthrax, and when boiled and mixed with milk, it is a good application\r\nto spreading gangrene. The Brassica sylvestris (which Sprengel inclines\r\nto set down as being the _Brassica incana_, Zenor.), he says, is\r\nagglutinative of wounds, and discutient of swellings and inflammations.\r\nIts cyme, he says, is not unpleasant to the taste. To the sea-cabbage\r\n(_Convolvulus soldanella_) he assigns the same characters as our author.\r\n(ii, 146, 147, 148.) Galen gives nearly the same account of the three\r\nspecies of brassica. In the Hippocratic treatises, the decoction of\r\ncabbage is recommended as an injection to the womb. (De Mulieb. ii.)\r\nAccording to Celsus, the brassica when half raw is laxative, but when\r\ntwice boiled, astringent. (ii, 29, 30.) The Arabians treat of the\r\ndifferent kinds of brassica at great length; as usual, drawing largely\r\nfrom the stores of the Greeks. One of the Arabian authorities quoted by\r\nRhases, says its seed, if applied per vaginam post coitum, will prevent\r\nimpregnation, and that the decoction of it expels the tape-worm. Another\r\nof the same authorities recommends a decoction of it as an application\r\nto the joints in gout, and to blistered surfaces after burning, more\r\nespecially when its ashes are mixed up with the white of an egg. (Contin.\r\nl. ult. i, 198.) See in like manner, Serapion (c. 32) and Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 139.) As we have stated in our commentary on the 95th section\r\nof the First Book, all the ancient authorities held that the cabbage\r\ncounteracts the intoxicating powers of wine. The brassicæ held a place\r\nin our Dispensatory, and retained their ancient character down to a\r\ncomparatively recent date. See Parkinson, Culpeper, and still more\r\nrecently Quincy. (116.) They are still much prized as medicines by the\r\nArabians and Persians. See Ainslie (M. Ind.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚραταιόγονον,\r\n\r\nCratæogonon; the fruit of this herb is acrid to the taste and cold like\r\nmillet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides assigns it wonderful powers in promoting\r\nprocreation, and hence its name. He calls it intensely acrid. Galen and\r\nthe other Greek authorities, treat of it very succinctly like Paulus.\r\nWe have not been able to find any traces of it in the Mat. Med. of the\r\nArabians. What plant it was seems a puzzle. Both Parkinson (Theatre of\r\nPlants, 858) and Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. l. c.) incline to the _Polygonum\r\nPersicaria_, but the medicinal virtues of it, as given by our older\r\nherbalists, do by no means agree with the characters of the cratæogonon\r\nas given by the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρῆθμον,\r\n\r\nCrethmum, _Samphire_, is somewhat saltish with a little bitterness, and\r\ntherefore its powers are detergent and desiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the Crithmum maritimum, _Samphire_, or _Sea-fennel_.\r\nDioscorides recommends its fruit, root, and leaves, when boiled in\r\nwine, for dysuria and jaundice. He further mentions it as a potherb\r\nand pickle. (ii, 156.) Galen and the other Greek authorities state its\r\ncharacters briefly like our author. Pliny, like Dioscorides, mentions it\r\nas a potherb and pickle, but says nothing of it as a medicine. (H. N.\r\nxxvi.) We do not find it noticed by Celsus nor by the Arabians, with the\r\nexception of Ebn Baithar. (ii, 280.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚριθὴ,\r\n\r\nHordeum, _Barley_, is of the first order of cooling and desiccative\r\nmedicines, and is also somewhat detergent. It is more desiccative than\r\nthe flour of beans, and less flatulent. The polenta of barley is more\r\ndesiccative than barley itself. Its ptisan is not only more diluent, but\r\nis also more detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Hordeum vulgare_, comprehending no doubt several\r\nspecies. We have treated of it among the Cerealia in the First Book (Vol.\r\nI, p. 123.) The ἄλφιτον, or polenta, was a sort of malt. See Pliny (H.\r\nN. xviii, 14.) We have treated of it in the same place; and also of the\r\nmode of preparing ptisan. It was a favorite remedy with Hippocrates (de\r\nvictu acut. et alibi.) Dioscorides calls it suitable to the acrimony,\r\nroughness, and ulceration of the windpipe, and says it attracts milk\r\nwhen taken boiled with the seed of fennel, and is diuretic, detergent,\r\nflatulent, bad for the stomach, and digestive of swellings. He further\r\nrecommends the flour of barley for discussing boils and inflammations,\r\nwhen boiled with figs and honeyed water. See further (ii, 108.) Galen,\r\nAëtius, and Oribasius, treat of it in nearly the same terms as our\r\nauthor. The Arabians give nearly the same statement of its virtues as\r\na medicine. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 530.) He recommends barley-water very\r\nmuch as a drink in fevers, being, as he says, diluent and cooling; in hot\r\nfevers it is to be given pure, and in cold, with parsley and fennel. Ebn\r\nBaithar treats of it at great length, (ii, 97.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρίμνον,\r\n\r\nCrimnon, _Bran_; the thick part of the flour of wheat and of spelt is so\r\nnamed, being more nutritious than polenta, but more indigestible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is, properly speaking, groats or coarse meal; it was\r\nalso applied to spelt and other species of grain coarsely ground. See\r\nDioscorides, from whom our author’s account of it is principally taken.\r\nBoth Dioscorides and Galen recommend the coarse meal of spelt which has\r\nbeen toasted for binding the belly. From the coarse meal of wheat, pap or\r\nporridge, they add, is prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρίνον,\r\n\r\nLilium, _the Lily_; its flower is of a mixed temperament, being\r\ncomposed of a subtile part, a terrene, and a certain water substance\r\nof a moderate temperament. Hence the oil composed from it being of a\r\ndiscutient and emollient nature agrees well with inflammations of the\r\nuterus. The root of it and its leaves are desiccative, detergent, and\r\nmoderately discutient, and hence are useful for burns. The juice of it is\r\nserviceable for wounded nerves, with oxymel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Lilium candidum_. Dioscorides\r\npraises the seed of the lily, given in wine, as an antidote to\r\npoisonous serpents; and, by the way, the same character is given of\r\nit by Walafridus Strabo in the ninth century, and by Macer Floridus\r\nin the tenth. Dioscorides further recommends it as an application to\r\nburns, ulcers, erysipelas, and so forth. He further describes a species\r\nof lilium with purple flowers, which grows in Syria and Pisidia of\r\nPamphylia, and was famous for the composition of unguents. This might\r\nbe the _Lilium Martagon_. Galen writes elaborately on this article, but\r\nin the main agrees with Dioscorides as to the medicinal virtues of the\r\nlily, of which he mentions only the former species. He recommends it\r\nprincipally in external applications to wounds, ulcers, and diseases\r\nof the skin, such as scabies, leprosy, and achores, and also very\r\nparticularly to diseases of the uterus. Aëtius and Oribasius briefly\r\ngive it the same characters. Celsus mentions a decoction of the leaves\r\nof the lily boiled in old wine and oil, as an application to burns. (v,\r\n17, 18.) For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 436); Serapion (c. 189);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 422); Ebn Baithar (ii, 68.) They commend it as a\r\ngeneral alexipharmic, both when applied to the bites of venomous animals,\r\nand as an antidote to hyoscyamus, coriander, and mushrooms. They all\r\nagree that it is one of the best applications to burning with hot water.\r\nAvicenna says the oil of lilies given internally, is useful in ileos. Ebn\r\nBaithar treats of the lily at very great length.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚροκοδείλιον,\r\n\r\nCrocodilium; the seed and juice of it are possessed of desiccative,\r\nheating, and discutient powers, and are, therefore, diuretic and\r\nemmenagogue; the root is of great use as an expectorant, and occasions a\r\ndischarge of blood by the nose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes it immediately after the black\r\nchamæleon to which he compares it. We therefore are inclined to join\r\nthe modern commentators and herbalists, who hold it to have been the\r\n_Carlina vulgaris_, rather than those who refer it to the _Eryngium\r\nmaritimum_. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 971, 988) and Sprengel (Ad\r\nDioscor. iii, 10.) Galen calls its seed aromatic and acrid, and says\r\nit is diuretic and emmenagogue. The juice of the seed and stalk being\r\npossessed, he says, of similar powers, is useful in nephritic diseases.\r\nThe root is expectorant, and produces a discharge of blood from the\r\nnostrils. (De Simpl. vii.) We have not been able to discover any traces\r\nof it in the Mat. Med. of the Arabians, except in Ebn Baithar. (ii, 253.)\r\nHis German translator holds it to be the _Eryngium maritimum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρόκος,\r\n\r\nCrocus, _Saffron_, is of the second order of heating and of the first of\r\ndesiccative medicines. It is also astringent and digestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Crocus sativus_. Dioscorides gives\r\nan interesting account of the different varieties of it which were used\r\nin his time. Suffice it to say, that the best decidedly was the Cicilian,\r\nfrom Mount Corycus, which is often alluded to by classical authors. See\r\nPliny (xxi, 6); Celsus (v, 22); Statius (Silv. v, 3, 41); Galen (De\r\nAntid. i.) With regard to its action on the animal economy, he mentions\r\nthat Thessalus held that it is merely fragrant, while some, on the other\r\nhand, maintained that it is a deadly poison in doses of dr. iij, but that\r\nin truth it is diuretic and sub-astringent, and therefore applicable to\r\nerysipelas and defluxions of the eyes, as a cure for surfeit, and for\r\nproducing a discharge of urine (i, 25.) See, in like manner, Pliny (l.\r\nc.) It occurs in the Hippocratic treatises, and in the works of Celsus,\r\nwho calls it purgative, emollient, and discutient. (196.) By the way,\r\nwe may mention that by purgative, Celsus evidently means cleansing in\r\nexternal applications, as is evident from the substances with which it is\r\nenumerated, namely, verdigris, orpiment, &c. His editor, Dr. Milligan,\r\ntherefore evidently mistakes the meaning of his author. (l. c.) Galen\r\nand his followers call it heating in the second degree, and drying in\r\nthe first, with some astringency. The Arabians adopt the views of the\r\nGreeks as to its virtues, but prescribe it in a great many more cases\r\nthan their predecessors. See Serapion (c. 173); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n241); Avicenna (ii, 2, 126.) Thus they held that it is both aphrodisiacal\r\nand cordial, and recommend it accordingly. They also used it in cases\r\nof difficult labour, and as a deobstruent in obstructions of the liver\r\nand spleen. One of Rhases’s authorities says that in doses of three\r\ndrachms it proves fatal. Another of them says of it, that it improves\r\nthe breathing and appetite. Symeon Seth says that it is stomachic and\r\nimproves the colour. He, Serapion, and other of the ancient authorities,\r\naffirm that in large doses it occasions involuntary laughter, immoderate\r\nmirth, and the other effects which result from intoxicating liquors. From\r\nlate experiments, it would appear that its powers had been overrated.\r\nSee Pereira (Mat. Med. 696.) It was much used by the ancients as a\r\nperfume. See Beckmann’s ‘Hist. of Inventions,’ Joh. Bodæus a Stapel (Ad\r\nTheophrast. H. P. vi, 6), and Hertodt’s ‘Crocologia,’ as quoted by him.\r\nIts medical use, he adds, has always continued among the Orientals.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚρόμμυον,\r\n\r\nCepa, _Onion_, is of the fourth order of heating medicines, its substance\r\nconsisting of thick matter, and hence when applied to hemorrhoids it\r\nopens them. It is also sufficiently detergent, and removes alphos with\r\nvinegar; and in alopecia it occasions a more rapid growth of hair than\r\nalcyonium. Its juice is useful in suffusion and dimness of vision from\r\nthick humours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Allium Cepa_, or onion. Galen, Dioscorides, and\r\nSerapion recommend it as an application in cases of alopecia or _Porrigo\r\ndecalvans_. Dioscorides says that some applied it as a suppository\r\nto promote the discharge of blind piles, and he mentions its being\r\nintroduced into the nose to promote the discharge from it. As a cataplasm\r\nwith salt, rue, and honey, he recommends it for the bites of rabid\r\ndogs. He says it concocts and breaks hard tumours. Upon the whole,\r\nGalen, Aëtius, Oribasius, and our author, do little more under this head\r\nthan abridge the more ample account of it given by Dioscorides. Celsus\r\ncalls it an aperient of the bowels (ii, 29) and a diuretic (ii, 31.)\r\nHe recommends it to be chewed in paralysis of the tongue. (iv, 2.) The\r\nArabians treat of it at great length. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 119); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. iii, 18); Serapion (c. 354.) They speak favorably of it as\r\na rubefacient, and all ascribe great powers to it as an alexipharmical\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύαμος,\r\n\r\nFaba, _the Bean_, is not far removed from a middle temperament as to\r\ncooling and drying. Its flesh is also somewhat detergent. It agrees,\r\ntherefore, with expectorations from the chest and lungs. Its outer skin\r\nhaving also some astringency renders the whole bean, when boiled in\r\noxycrate, a suitable remedy for cæliac and dysenteric affections. In a\r\ncataplasm it cures inflammations and swellings, and dispels the milk in\r\nthe breasts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have stated in the First Book the difficulty of\r\ndetermining exactly the nature of the ancient faba. See Parkinson\r\n(Theatre of Plants, 1054) and Dickson (Husbandry of the Ancients.)\r\nDioscorides describes two species, the Egyptian and the Greek, of which\r\nthe former, there can be little doubt, is the _Nelumbium speciosum_.\r\nSee Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. ii, 128), and Lindley (Veget. King. 414.) The\r\nother, as we formerly stated, was probably a variety of our small bean.\r\nThe characters of both are fully stated by Dioscorides, from whom Galen\r\nand our author borrow largely under this head. They treat, however,\r\nonly of the Greek bean. Dioscorides says the Egyptian is astringent\r\nand stomachic; that the flour of it made into a poultice, answers in\r\ndysenteric and colic affections, and in earache. The Arabians give a very\r\nfull account of the two species of bean, both as articles of food and as\r\nmedicines. See in particular, Avicenna (ii, 2, 241); Serapion (c. 97);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 279.) Avicenna and Rhases agree in commending\r\nbeans for spitting of blood, and other affections of the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύανος,\r\n\r\nCyanus, is possessed of acrid, purgative, and discutient powers, greater\r\nthan those of the cinnabar. It has also some astringency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Matthiolus determines it to be the _Lapis Lazuli_, and\r\nSprengel agrees with him that it was a mineral containing copper and some\r\nimpurities, and nearly allied to the _L. Laz._ Serapion describes the\r\nἀρμένιον by the name of _Lapis Lazuli_, and, in fact, the ἀρμένιον and\r\nκύανος seem to have been nearly the same thing. He recommends it as a\r\npurgative which evacuates black bile. Rhases, in his chapter on the Lapis\r\nLazuli, gives the observations of Dioscorides and Galen on the ἀρμένιον,\r\nand in his chapter on the _Lapis Armenus_, he compares it to the _Lapis\r\nLazuli_ (Cont. l. ult. i, 393, 404.) The following is Sprengel’s account\r\nof the armenium and cyanus: “Armenium est cuprum carbonicum terreum,\r\nlapidi Lazuli simile. Id in australibus petris arenosis, has ipsas\r\npenetrans mineram æris arenosam format. Ea vocatur κύανος.” (Ad Dioscor.\r\nv, 105.) From what has been stated, any person acquainted with mineralogy\r\ncan have no difficulty in deciding that the _cyanus_ and _armenium_\r\nwere varieties of the mineral called “blue copper” by Jameson, that is\r\nto say, the “blue carbonate of copper” of Cleaveland (566.) For further\r\ninformation regarding it, we would refer to Matthiolus and Sprengel (Ad\r\nDioscor. l. c.), Beckmann (Hist. of Invent.), and our article under this\r\nhead in the Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon. Our author copies his\r\naccount of it from Galen. Dioscorides recommends it only as an external\r\napplication, possessed of repressing, moderately septic, escharotic, and\r\nulcerative powers. (v, 106.) The Arabians, who, however, evidently do not\r\ndistinguish properly this mineral from the lapis lazuli, recommend it as\r\nan emmenagogue and purgative. When boiled with lentils, Avicenna says, it\r\nacts as an emetic in the case of a person who has swallowed any poison.\r\nHe also prescribes it in asthma and pain of the kidneys. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 56); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 692); Serapion (c. 389.) The later\r\nGreek writers on medicine, like the Arabians, confound this substance\r\nwith the lapis lazuli. See Theophanes Nonnus (c. 125, 143); Myrepsus (i,\r\n30.) The former of these prescribes it as a specific in the plague. In\r\nmodern times also the cyanus or blue copper has been confounded with the\r\nlapis lazuli. See Lewis (M. M. ii, 50.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύκλάμινος,\r\n\r\nCyclaminus, _Sow-bread_, is possessed of various powers; for it cleanses,\r\nincides, opens the mouths of vessels, and discusses; the juice of it,\r\ntherefore, when applied to hemorrhoids opens them, and it discusses\r\nhardness along with other things. Along with honey it agrees with\r\nsuffusions and purges by the nose. When rubbed into the epigastrium, it\r\nloosens the belly and kills the fœtus. The whole root, though weaker than\r\nthe juice, is also strong, so that when drunk with honeyed water to the\r\namount of three drachms, it purges the internal parts. To the skin it\r\nalso proves detergent. The root of the other species of sow-bread (called\r\nCissanthemon) is of no medicinal use, but its fruit is drastic, so that\r\nwhen drunk it acts like the former.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides treats at considerable length of the medicinal\r\nvirtues of the former species, which was the _Cyclamen Europæum_,\r\nrecommending it as being phlegmagogue, hydragogue, emmenagogue, and\r\nalexipharmic; as an errhine in diseases of the head, and a suppository\r\nper vaginam. His other species, which he describes as having leaves\r\nlike the ivy, and which some of the commentators set down as being\r\nthe _Lonicera Periclymenum_, and others as the _Solanum Dulcamara_ he\r\nrecommends in splenic affections, in orthopnœa, and retention of the\r\nlochial discharge. (ii, 193, 194.) Pliny recommends also the second\r\nspecies as a remedy for coughs (H. N. xxv, 68.) Harduin agrees with\r\nDodonæus in holding it to be the _Dulcamara_. The scholiast on Theocritus\r\nrecommends the cyclaminus as an application to chilblains. (Ad Idyll, v.)\r\nGalen writes of it in such terms as shows that he looked upon it as a\r\nvery important article. He says it promotes menstruation, both when taken\r\ninternally and when applied per vaginam; and that it cures jaundice,\r\nnot only by purging the viscus, but by evacuating the whole body with\r\nsweats; he also recommends it as an external application in hardness\r\nof the spleen. The other species he praises in asthma. The other Greek\r\nauthorities supply nothing of much interest under this head. The Arabians\r\ntreat of it largely, but somewhat confusedly. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 6,\r\n61, 271); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 281); Mesue (De Simpl. 26); Serapion (c.\r\n259.) Avicenna directs it to be given to the extent of three drachms with\r\nwine or mulse in cases of jaundice, and the patient is to be then covered\r\nup with many clothes, when he will sweat out the bile from his body.\r\nHe says it purges the body, not only when given by the mouth, but in a\r\nsuppository, and when rubbed into the skin. Rhases (l. c.) describes it\r\nunder the names of _Falamios_, or Panis porcinus, whence the English name\r\nSow-bread. His extracts from Dioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and Bimasay\r\ncomprise all the information on the subject possessed by his Grecian\r\nmasters and his countrymen. Mesue gives a very elaborate article on the\r\nSow-bread, which, like Avicenna, he praises as a general purger of bile,\r\nwhen taken by the mouth, in a suppository, and as a liniment rubbed into\r\nthe belly; he also praises it as an emmenagogue, both when taken by the\r\nmouth and when applied as a pessary, and as a tried remedy in jaundice\r\nand induration of the spleen. Even as late as the days of Quincy, the\r\ncyclaminus held a place in the Dispensatory, and retained all its ancient\r\ncharacters. (i, 4, 293.) Orfila ranks it with the acrid poisons (iii, 3.)\r\nSee further (ii, 242.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύμινον,\r\n\r\nCuminum, _Cumin_, belongs to the third order of heating medicines, and is\r\ndiuretic and carminative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The C. of our author is no doubt the Cyminum sativum of\r\nDioscorides, i. e. _Cuminum Cyminum_ L. The two varieties of the wild\r\ncumin of Dioscorides have never been satisfactorily determined. See\r\nParkinson, Matthiolus, and Sprengel. Dioscorides represents it as\r\nbeing calefacient, astringent, desiccative, and relieving tormina and\r\nflatulence, and describes a variety of cases in which he calls it\r\napplicable. (iii, 61.) Galen says it is diuretic and carminative, being\r\ncalefacient in the third degree. Aëtius and Oribasius give it much the\r\nsame character. Celsus assigns to it diuretic powers. (iv, 9.) The\r\nArabians treat of it at so great length, that we can scarcely do justice\r\nto their views on this head. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 212); Serapion\r\n(c. 287); Avicenna (ii, 2, 136); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar\r\n(ii, 394.) Avicenna says the immoderate use of it renders the face pale.\r\nThis property of cumin is alluded to by the poets as well as the medical\r\nauthors. See Horace (Epist. i, 19, 18); Persius (Sat. v.) This character\r\nof it is confirmed by modern authority. See Matthiolus (Ad Dioscor. l.\r\nc.); Bodæus a Stapel (in Theophrast.) Cumin now barely holds a very\r\nundistinguished place in our Mat. Med. (See Pereira, 1057.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚυνόσβατος,\r\n\r\nRubus caninus, Hip-tree or Dog-rose; the fruit is no bad astringent; the\r\nleaves are moderately astringent; but we must guard against the woolly\r\npart of the fruit, as it is injurious to the trachea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides’s description is not so precise as to enable us\r\nto pronounce decidedly what it was; but we incline with several of the\r\nbest authorities to refer it to the _Rosa canina_, or Hip-tree. Galen,\r\nour author, and the other Greek authorities, follow Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚυπάρισσος,\r\n\r\nCupressus, _Cypress_; the spherical fruit and shoots of it are possessed\r\nof desiccative powers, having no sensible heat, so that they agglutinate\r\nlarge wounds in hard bodies. In moist gangrene it consumes deep-seated\r\nhumours without trouble, and is useful in intestinal hernia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears unquestionably to be the _Cupressus sempervirens_.\r\nSee Stackhouse (Tab. Syst. in Theophrast.) Its fruit, being of a globular\r\nshape, was called σφάιρια by the Greeks and _Pilulæ_ by the Latins. Pliny\r\n(H. N. xvii, 14.) Pliny recommends this as a cure for the stings of\r\nserpents, and in cases of hæmoptysis. (H. N. xxiv, 10.) Dioscorides and\r\nSerapion recommend it in these and various other cases. The cypress-nut\r\nis powerfully astringent and balsamic: hence it proves an excellent\r\nremedy in diarrhœas and dysenteries, and, as such, it is celebrated by\r\nmany authors ancient and modern. Dioscorides in particular recommends it\r\nfor stopping bleeding, for agglutinating wounds, and as an application\r\nto erysipelas and anthrax. Galen writes fully of it, but borrows largely\r\nfrom Dioscorides. Serapion does little more than give the notices of it\r\nby Dioscorides and Galen. (c. 55.) Avicenna recommends the cypress, and\r\nmore especially the nut, in various cases requiring astringents, and\r\namong others as an application to polypus of the nose; he also speaks\r\nfavorably of it in cases of hæmoptysis and dysuria. Like the others, he\r\nsays it is a good application in ruptures. (ii, 2, 146.) See further\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 216.) The cypress is found in the ‘Flora\r\nHippocratica,’ and in that of Celsus. The cypress-nuts are commended\r\nas astringents by all our older herbalists, and held a place in our\r\nDispensatory as late as the time of Quincy. (93.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύπερος,\r\n\r\nCyperus, is heating and desiccative, without pungency. Hence it promotes\r\nthe cicatrization of the more humid ulcers in a wonderful manner, and\r\nrelieves those in the mouth. It has also some incisive quality, and is\r\nlithontriptic, diuretic, and emmenagogue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is undoubtedly the _Cyperus rotundus_. Our author’s\r\naccount of its medicinal uses is taken from Galen, and is confirmed\r\nby Serapion, Avicenna, and Rhases. All of them, however, are indebted\r\nto Dioscorides, who gives it the character of being calefacient,\r\nanastomotic, and diuretic, recommends it in uterine complaints as an\r\nemmenagogue, in ulcers of the mouth, and as an ingredient in emollient\r\nplasters. (i, 4.) A modern author, Dr. Hill, gives it nearly the\r\nsame character as the ancients; he calls it stomachic, deobstruent,\r\nemmenagogue, and diuretic. It likewise occurs in the Materia Medica of\r\nTournefort, who also calls it deobstruent and emmenagogue. Quincy gives a\r\nconfused account of it under the name of _Cyprus_ (Engl. Dispens. i, l,\r\n69); see also Lewis. Dioscorides describes also an Indian species having\r\na root resembling ginger. Both Matthiolus and Sprengel are inclined to\r\nrefer to the _Curcuma_. We shall have occasion to notice it afterwards,\r\nwhen describing the substances introduced into the Mat. Med. by the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύπρος,\r\n\r\nLigustrum, _Privet_; its leaves and tops are possessed of mixed powers,\r\nbeing discutient and astringent, and desiccative without pain or\r\npungency. Hence the decoction of it, when poured on a part, is useful for\r\nburns, and agrees with inflammations of a hot nature. When chewed it also\r\nrelieves aphthæ, and is mixed up with splenic remedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We must decline entering upon the general literature of this\r\nsubject, which has created a good deal of discussion. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that we have now no hesitation in deciding it to be the _Lawsonia\r\ninermis_, namely, the plant from which the henna of Egypt is obtained.\r\nSee Lindley’s Veg. King. (575.) It is used by females for staining\r\ntheir hands and feet of an orange colour. Dioscorides mentions that an\r\ninfusion of its leaves in the juice of saponaria, or soapwort, was used\r\nfor painting the hairs yellow. He says of the ointment prepared from it\r\n(unguentum cyprinum), that it is calefacient, emollient, and fragrant.\r\n(i, 124.) Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius give it the same characters as\r\nour author. The Arabians describe it under the name of _alcanna_, which\r\nseems to be _henna_ with an Arabic prefix. See in particular Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 110), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 50.) Both copy freely from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. They say its virtues in female complaints are similar to\r\nthose of the Sanguis Draconis. All praise it as a vulnerary herb, and a\r\ngood application in cases of burning. They further commend it in pleurisy\r\nand quinsy as a plaster. Ebn Baithar treats of it at very great length.\r\n(i, 338.) It would appear that the privet is still used as a medicine and\r\ndye by the native physicians of Hindostan. See a very interesting account\r\nof it in Ainslie’s Mat. Indica (ii, 190.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚύτισος,\r\n\r\nCytisus; its leaves are of a gently discutient and tepid nature, like\r\nthose of melons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. After maturely weighing the opinions which have been held\r\nrespecting this classical herb, we have no hesitation in agreeing\r\nwith those who refer it to the _Tree-medick_ (_Medicago arborea_ L.)\r\nDioscorides says its leaves are cooling and discutient when applied\r\nexternally, and diuretic when taken in decoction. (iv, iii.) Galen and\r\nthe other Greek authorities treat of it very succinctly, like our author.\r\nAvicenna briefly recommends it as a diuretic medicine, and one which is\r\napplicable in diseases of the spleen. (ii, 2, 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚώνειον,\r\n\r\nCicuta, _Hemlock_; that it is possessed of extremely cold powers is\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears unquestionably to be the _Conium maculatum_.\r\nStoerck and Bergius, contrary to the opinions of the ancient physicians,\r\naffirm that it is aphrodisiacal. This, however, seems doubtful. We have\r\ntreated of its effects as a poison in the Fifth Book. As a medicine it\r\ndoes not appear to have been much used latterly, although Dioscorides\r\nsays that its inspissated juice is of great use in the healing art,\r\nbeing mixed with wine in anodyne collyria, and used as a cataplasm for\r\nthe cure of erysipelas and herpes. He also speaks of its being applied\r\nas a cataplasm to the testicles for the removal of the pollutio nocturni\r\nsomni, and with the view of inducing impotence; and to the breasts, in\r\norder to dispel milk and render them atrophied. (iv, 79.) Galen, Aëtius,\r\nand Oribasius, like our author, merely state of it, in their works in\r\nthe Mat. Med., that it is possessed of intensely refrigerant powers.\r\nIt would appear that Galen was in the practice of administering it\r\ninternally. (T. ii, 451, ed. Basil.) Of the Arabians, Avicenna gives\r\nthe fullest exposition of its remedial powers, but he copies closely\r\nfrom Dioscorides, recommending it as a cold and narcotic application in\r\nthe same cases as Dioscorides. He says it stops bleeding, congeals the\r\nblood, and induces torpor. (ii, 2, 662.) See also Serapion (c. 347.) It\r\nis, most probably, the cicuta of Celsus, who places it in his list of\r\nemollients. (v, 15.) It occurs also in the Hippocratic Collection, where\r\nboth its leaves and seeds are recommended in fomentations. (De Steril.;\r\nde Fistulis, &c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΚῶνος,\r\n\r\nStrobilus, _the Wild Pine_; the bark and leaves have powers like the\r\npine, but more acrid and drastic. As to the fruit, which is called\r\nstrobilus, the green has some bitterness and acrimony, with humidity, and\r\nhence it is applicable for promoting expectoration from the chest. The\r\nesculent kind, when soaked in water, so as to lay aside its acrimony,\r\nbecomes of a good temperament, being free from pungency and emplastic,\r\nand hence it smooths asperities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It here signifies the _Pinus sylvestris_, or Wild-pine;\r\nbut it is commonly put for the _Nux Pinea_, or the cones of the _Pinus\r\nPinea_, called in the shops _Pignoli pines_, and the seeds _pine-nuts_.\r\nAthenæus says that Theophrastus called the tree πέυκη and the fruit\r\nκῶνος. Diphilus, as quoted by the same, calls the pine-nuts nutritious,\r\nand says that they lubricate the trachea, and promote expectoration.\r\n(Deip. ii.) Galen, Serapion, and the other authorities also commend\r\nthem in similar cases. Dioscorides treats of this subject in the 86th,\r\n87th, and 88th chapters in the First Book, but not under the same head\r\nas our author. He recommends the different articles in nearly the same\r\ncases as Paulus and the other authorities. The fruit of the wild pine he\r\ncommends as a demulcent in affections of the bladder and kidneys, and as\r\na sedative in pains of the stomach. Celsus prescribes “nuclei ex pinu\r\nsilvestri duodecim,” among his remedies for ulcerated kidneys. (iv, 10.)\r\nAvicenna treats of the subject under different heads, like Dioscorides,\r\nwhom he closely follows. (ii, 2, 280, 301, 555, 693.) He recommends\r\nthese articles in diseases of the chest and kidneys. He calls the fruit\r\naphrodisiacal. See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 3, 20); Serapion (c.\r\n63); Averrhoes (Coll. v, 42.) All speak favorably of these medicines in\r\ndiseases of the kidneys and bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛαγώπους,\r\n\r\nLagopus, is possessed of desiccative powers and dries up fluxes of the\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This plant, the description of which is passed over by\r\nDioscorides as being well known, may be set down among the articles of\r\nthe ancient Materia Medica, which are least known to us. We may just\r\nmention regarding it, that some take it for _Trifolium arvense_, and\r\nothers for _Lagurus ovatus_. Dioscorides calls it an astringent of the\r\nbowels, and mentions that it was used as an amulet in buboes. (iv,\r\n17.) Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius briefly notice it as a desiccative\r\nmedicine. We have not been able to find this article in the Mat. Med. of\r\nthe Arabians, but are aware that it may be concealed under some of their\r\nodd corruptions of the Greek terms. It seems probable that this is the\r\n_lagopyrus_ of Hippocrates. (De Ulcer.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛάδανον,\r\n\r\nLadanum; it is formed from the Cistus called Ladanus; the goats feeding\r\nupon it bring away upon their beard and thighs the fatter and more juicy\r\npart of the herb. Ladanum, when collected, is an excellent medicine, hot\r\nin about the second degree, and consisting of subtile particles. It is\r\nmoderately emollient, discutient, and digestive; it therefore agrees with\r\nuterine affections in particular. It has also some astringency, and hence\r\nit strengthens hairs which are falling out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dierbach and Sprengel agree with the elder commentators in\r\ncalling it the _Cistus Creticus_. See also Royal Pharm. (i, c. 20.) Dr.\r\nLindley says of the ladanum, that it is a resinous balsamic substance\r\nobtained from Cistus Creticus, and other species of the genus; he adds,\r\nthat it has been esteemed as a stimulant and emmenagogue, and recommended\r\nin chronic catarrh. (Veg. King. 350.) Dioscorides mentions that it was\r\nprocured either from the beards of goats which had browsed upon it, or by\r\nscraping the tree with thongs. Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen deliver its\r\nmedicinal characters in much the same terms as our author. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it not only in uterine diseases, but also as a diuretic. He\r\nalso speaks favorably of it as an ingredient in anodyne and expectorant\r\nplasters. (i, 128.) See Galen (ii, 160 ed. Basil.) The Arabians treat\r\nfully of it, but borrow almost every word they say respecting it from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 422); Serapion (c. 43);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 361); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) The labdanum\r\nwas retained in the Dispensatory as late as the time of Quincy, who\r\nhas given an accurate account of it. (70.) It is also very correctly\r\ndescribed by Tournefort, both in his voyage to the Levant and in his Mat.\r\nMed. (363.) Its use, however, is now obsolete. See Pereira (1263.) In\r\nPemberton’s edition of the Dispensatory, there is given a formula for the\r\ncomposition of a “stomach plaster,” one of the ingredients of which is\r\nlabdanum. (359.) We would vote for its being restored to the Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛαθυρὶς,\r\n\r\nLathyris, is a species of spurge, and some say that its juice purges in a\r\nsimilar manner. Its seed in particular has purgative powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt, from our author’s brief notice of\r\nit, that it is the _Euphorbia Lathyris_, L. Dioscorides says of it that\r\nit evacuates phlegm, bile, and water. He mentions that its leaves were\r\nboiled along with a fowl or pot-herbs to loosen the bowels. Galen and\r\nthe other Greek authorities treat of it in brief terms, like our author.\r\nThe Arabians treat of it at greater length, recommending it strongly in\r\ndiseases of the joints, gout, and sciatica. They also mention its being a\r\nremedy for dropsy. They say it acts as an emetic. They direct its seeds\r\nto be boiled in the broth of an old cock, and taken. See in particular\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 473); Serapion (c. 354.) It is not met with in the works\r\neither of Hippocrates or of Celsus. It does not occur in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia, but is briefly noticed in Dr. Pereira’s Materia Medica\r\n(777.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛαμψάνη,\r\n\r\nLampsana, _Nipplewort_, when eaten supplies bad juices to the body. In a\r\ncataplasm it is detergent and discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears pretty certain that it is the Charlock, that is\r\nto say, either the _Raphanus Raphanistrum_ or _Sinapi Arvense_. Both are\r\nknown by the English name of _Charlock_. It is rather a potherb than a\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛάπαθον,\r\n\r\nLapathum, _Dock_, is possessed of moderately discutient powers; but the\r\noxylapathum is also somewhat repellent. The seed, particularly of the\r\noxylapathum, being astringent, cures diarrhœas and dysenteries. The\r\nleaves, in so far, have opposite qualities to the seed; for they, when\r\neaten, loosen the belly, whereas it, when drunk, proves astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Of the _Rumices_, the Oxylapathum, or _Rumex acutus_, was\r\nthe species most used in medicine, and is the only one particularized by\r\nour author, with the exception of the hippolopathum already described.\r\nOf the four other species described by Dioscorides, the ὀξαλὶς is\r\npretty generally acknowledged as the _Rumex acetosa_. The others cannot\r\nbe determined with any degree of accuracy. See Sprengel, Sibthorp,\r\nMatthiolus, Parkinson, Gerard, and Rutty. Dioscorides gives the first\r\nof his species much the same characters as our author, recommending it\r\nmost especially as a discutient application to leprosies and scrofulous\r\ntumours. He also speaks favorably of it as applied on a pessary in the\r\nfluor albus. The roots, he adds, boiled in wine, cure jaundice, and act\r\nas lithontriptics, emmenagogues, and alexipharmics. He further speaks\r\nof the dock as being appended in the form of an amulet for scrofulous\r\nswellings. (ii, 140, 141.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat\r\ncursorily of the lapatha, like our author. They occur in the works of\r\nHippocrates and of Celsus; the latter ranks the _lapathum_ among the\r\narticles of food which contain bad juices (ii, 21), are bad for the\r\nstomach (ii, 25), and are laxative of the bowels (ii, 29.) Pliny’s\r\naccount of the lapatha is mostly taken from Dioscorides. (H. N. xx,\r\n85.) The term rumex, now generally applied to the genus dock, is taken\r\nfrom Pliny (xix, 60.) The dock is recommended by Africanus in jaundice,\r\ndropsy, and for the cure of leprosy, lichen, and alphos. (Geopon.\r\nxii, 38.) Macer, in the tenth century, describes it under the name\r\nof _paratella_, and, like the more ancient authorities, commends it\r\nexternally for the cure of cutaneous diseases, and internally as an\r\nastringent. The Arabians, in like manner, prescribe it in these cases,\r\nand in general copy from Dioscorides in treating of the different species\r\nof dock. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 53); Serapion (c. 3); Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 324.) The last of these treats fully of the rumices, but does\r\nnot seem to describe any species not noticed by the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛειμώνιον,\r\n\r\nLimonium, _Sea Lavender_; its fruit being austere, is given to the amount\r\nof an acetabulum, with wine, in cæliac and dysenteric affections, in\r\nhæmoptysis, and for the uterine discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the limonium is borrowed from\r\nDioscorides, who describes the plant as having leaves like beet, but\r\nmore slender and longer, a slender straight stem, like that of the\r\nlily, filled with red fruit of an astringent taste. Like our author, he\r\nrecommends it in cases requiring astringents. As far as we can judge,\r\nthe characters here given it by Dioscorides apply very well to the plant\r\ncalled sea lavender or red behen, namely, the _Statice Limonium_, L.\r\nCompare Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 1234) and Gray (Suppl. to the\r\nPharmac.) with Dioscorides (iv, 16.) There seems no necessity, therefore,\r\nfor following Gesner in transferring it to the _Polygonum Bistorta_. The\r\nother authorities, both Greek and Arabian, follow Dioscorides closely in\r\ntreating of the limonium. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 423); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 433); Ebn Baithar (ii, 452.) The German editor of the last of\r\nthese, we are glad to find, agrees with us in referring this article to\r\nthe _Statice Limonium_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛειχὴν,\r\n\r\nLichen; that upon rocks, which is like moss, being possessed of detergent\r\nand, at the same time, moderately refrigerant and desiccative powers,\r\ncures lichen, and is anti-inflammatory; and, as Dioscorides says, also\r\nstops hemorrhages. The lichens of horses, when triturated with vinegar,\r\nare said to cure epilepsy and the bite of every venomous animal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the vegetable is abridged from\r\nDioscorides, who, as stated by him, recommends it for stopping\r\nhemorrhages, and also for dispelling phlegmons and curing lichens: he\r\nadds, that it cures jaundice and removes defluxions of the mouth when\r\nrubbed in with honey. (iv, 53.) To which of the Lichenales of modern\r\nbotanists it is applicable is somewhat doubtful: whether to the _Sticta\r\npulmonacea_, as Matthiolus held; to the _Peltidea aphthosa_; or to the\r\n_Peltigera canina_. Compare Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. l. c.) with Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 48), and Parkinson (1315.) This is also evidently identical\r\nwith the second species of lichen described by Pliny. (H. N. xxvi, 10.)\r\nHis former species is the _Marchantia conica_, L. (Ibid.) See Harduin\r\n(apud l. c.)\r\n\r\nThe λέιχηνες ἱππῶν are the well-known callosities forming at the knees\r\nof horses, called _spavins_ in English. See further, Harduin ad Plin.\r\nH. N. xxviii, 49. They are thus described by Cælius Aurelianus: “Sunt\r\nautem squamulæ anteriorum crurum sub armorum partibus in ipsis animalibus\r\n(equis) nata; has Græci lichenas vocant, sive chelidonas, nos vero\r\nimpetigines vel hirundines.” (Tard. Pass. i, 4.) The Empirics gave them\r\nfor the cure of epilepsy. (Ibid.) See Avicenna (ii, 233) and Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. 271.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛεοντοπέταλον,\r\n\r\nLeontopetalum, _Lion’s-leaf_; its root is heating and desiccative in the\r\nthird degree, and is possessed of discutient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Although Dioscorides has described this plant with more than\r\nhis wonted accuracy, there is still some uncertainty regarding it, some\r\nholding it to be the _Leontice Leontopetalon_, and others the _Corydalis\r\nbulbosa_. The latter would appear to agree better in character with the\r\ndescription of Dioscorides than the other. See Lindley (Veg. King. 436.)\r\nThe other authorities treat of it in very general terms, like our author,\r\nexcept Oribasius, who gives a pretty minute description of it, like\r\nDioscorides. It is noticed by Ebn Baithar (ii, 186), who, however, does\r\nnot supply much additional information. Dr. Sontheimer sets it down for\r\nthe _Leontice Leontopetalon_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛεπίδιον,\r\n\r\nLepidium, _Pepperwort_ (by some called Iberis), belongs to the fourth\r\norder of calefacients, being like the cress in powers, but less\r\ndesiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of this plant (which is _Lepidium\r\nlatifolium_, Pepperwort) is mostly taken from Galen. Dioscorides says\r\nit is made into a pickle with milk, and that the power of its leaves is\r\nacrid and ulcerative, and hence it is used in a cataplasm for sciatica.\r\nHe says further of it, that it is also applicable in diseases of the\r\nspleen, removes leprosy, and that its root _would seem_ to soothe pains\r\nof the teeth when appended to the neck as an amulet. (ii, 205.) It is\r\nto be remarked that Dioscorides always speaks of the virtues of amulets\r\nin ambiguous terms. It is described by the Arabians under the name\r\nof _Sitarig_ or _Scitaragi_. See Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 655) and\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 657.) Avicenna’s description of it is somewhat confused,\r\nand cannot be easily reconciled with that of Dioscorides, but with regard\r\nto its medicinal virtues, they are quite agreed. Bimasuy, one of Rhases’s\r\nauthorities, says of it, that its seed is like the seed of nasturtium,\r\nbut not so heating. Beckmann mentions that the _Lepidium latifolium_ was\r\nat one time used as a kitchen vegetable, and was called, in England,\r\n_poor man’s pepper_. (Hist. of Invent.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛεπὶς,\r\n\r\nSquama, _Flake_; all kinds are strongly desiccative and astringent, and\r\npungent in no inconsiderable degree. But the squama æris (_Flakes of\r\ncopper_) is more desiccative, consists of more subtile particles, and has\r\nalso some verdigris, more especially that from Cyprian nails, which is\r\nhence called clavaris. The squama ferri is possessed of more astringency,\r\nand still more that which is formed from the edge of sharp instruments,\r\ncalled stomoma, hence it is better for ill-conditioned ulcers. But the\r\nsquama æris cleanses and melts down flesh more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The squama æris was a black per-oxyd of copper. The squama\r\nferri, a black oxyd of iron. The stomoma was the chalybs or steel. See\r\nDioscorides (v, 89), with the Commentaries of Matthiolus and Sprengel,\r\nand also the Appendix to Dunbar’s Lexicon. Geoffroy says of the squama\r\næris, that it is little different from the æs astum being only the\r\nparticles of burnt copper that fly off when hammered. Dioscorides calls\r\nit astringent and epulotic: when drunk with honeyed water, he says, it\r\nis phlegmagogue; some give it in flour as a pill; it is mixed, he adds,\r\nwith ophthalmic remedies, drying defluxions, and removing asperities\r\nof the eyelids. The stomoma, he says, is inferior to the squama æris\r\nas a purgative. (v, 89, 90.) Our author’s account of these substances\r\nis borrowed from Galen. Aëtius also copies from Galen. Oribasius\r\ngives a fuller description of them, differing very little from that\r\nof Dioscorides. The Arabians treat of all these substances, as usual,\r\nborrowing freely from Dioscorides, and not adding much of their own. See\r\nin particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 231); Serapion (c. 404); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. vi, 48); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43.) They prescribe the squama æris\r\ninternally as a purge, and say of it that when the palate is smeared\r\nwith it vomiting is excited. These substances occur in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises and in the works of Celsus. They have not been used medicinally\r\nin this country for some time past. The Hindoos use the preparations of\r\ncopper both internally and externally, according to Dr. Royle. (Hindoo\r\nMed. 90.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛευκάκανθον,\r\n\r\nLeucacanthon, _White Acanthus_ (called also Polygonaton and Ischias); its\r\nroot is of a cutting nature and desiccative in the third degree, and it\r\nis heating in the first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We can only determine for certain that it belonged to the\r\n_Carduineæ_, but can scarcely venture to fix the genus, so loose is the\r\ndescription which the ancient authors have given of it, and so various\r\nthe conjectures of modern commentators and herbalists respecting it.\r\nUpon the whole, the preponderance of the authorities is in favour of\r\nthe _Cirsium tuberosum_. Dioscorides says of it, that its root is\r\nintensely bitter, and that the decoction of it with wine relieves\r\nchronic pleurisy and sciatica, ruptures and sprains, and further, that\r\nit relieves toothache. (iii, 19.) Galen recommends it in cæliac and\r\nstomach affections and hemoptysis; as a cataplasm to swellings, and a\r\ncure to toothache when used as a gargle. Aëtius gives the same character\r\nof it. The Arabians ascribe the same virtues to it, and also hold it to\r\nhe alexipharmic. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 80, 671) and Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 118.) The use of it in medicine is as old as the\r\nHippocratic age. See Dierbach’s Materia Medica Hippocr.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛευκὰς,\r\n\r\nLeucas, is heating and desiccative in the third degree, but its\r\nprevailing property is acrimony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears certainly to be a species of _Lamium_, either\r\nthe _album_ or the _maculatum_. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 672)\r\nand Sprengel (Ad Dioscor.) Dioscorides commends it as an application to\r\nvenomous animals, especially those of the sea. (iii, 103.) The other\r\nauthorities treat of it in general terms, like our author, who copies\r\nalmost word for word from Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛευκοΐον,\r\n\r\nViola alba, _Stock Gillyflower_; the whole plant is detergent and\r\nattenuating, especially its flowers, and those in particular which are\r\ndrier, so that it promotes menstruation, kills and ejects the fœtus; and\r\nif their powers are blunted by a mixture with water, they will answer\r\nwith inflammations, particularly those of the uterus. The roots being\r\npossessed of similar powers, are composed of more gross matter, and are\r\nmore terrene. But with vinegar they relieve indurated phlegmons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the plant here described was stock, i. e. _Cheiranthus\r\nCheiri_, is unquestionable. Dioscorides evidently included also another\r\nplant of the same order under this head, which, as stated by Sprengel,\r\nmay probably be a variety of the _Matthiola incana_. He gives nearly the\r\nsame account of its medicinal virtues as our author. Dioscorides says\r\nit kills the fœtus _in utero_ when applied on a pessary; and Galen and\r\nAëtius ascribe the same powers to it when taken in a draught. By the\r\nArabians it is obscurely treated of, their authorities in general seeming\r\nto confound it with the violet. See Rhases (Ad Mansor. iii, 21); Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. ii, 37, 226); Ebn Baithar (i, 403.) The last of these does\r\nlittle more than copy from Galen and Dioscorides. It is not contained in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia. It is the _Viola lutea_ of our herbalist\r\nGerard, and held a place in our Dispensatory as late as Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛέυκη,\r\n\r\nPopulus alba, _the White Poplar_; the tree being composed of a watery,\r\ntepid, and terrene substance, has detergent properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt of its being the _Populus alba_, L.\r\nDioscorides says of it, that its bark, when taken in a draught, cures\r\nsciatica and strangury; that it is said to prevent conception; and that\r\nit is a remedy for earache and other complaints. (i, 109.) Our author\r\ncopies from Galen. The Arabians, under this head, are servile copyists\r\nfrom the Greeks. See Serapion (c. 30); Avicenna (ii, 2, 333); and Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 340.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιβανωτὶς,\r\n\r\nRosmarinus, _Rosemary_; there are three varieties of it, one of which is\r\nsterile, and the other two bear fruit. They are possessed of detergent,\r\nincisive, discutient, and emollient powers. The juice of them, with\r\nhoney, cures dimness of sight occasioned by thick humours. A decoction of\r\nthat variety, which is used for garlands, proves serviceable in jaundice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, like our author, describes three species, of\r\nwhich the first bears a fruit called _cachrys_, a term previously used\r\nby Theophrastus and Nicander, and from which the plant has now got the\r\nscientific appellation of _Cachrys Libanotis_. The root of this plant\r\nis still kept by our apothecaries, although it has long ceased to hold\r\na place in our Dispensatory. See Gray’s Suppl. to the Pharmacop. (80.)\r\nThe second species is probably the _Ferula nodiflora_. The third cannot\r\nbe satisfactorily determined. Our old English herbalists give the\r\nlibanotis the name of “herb frankincense.” (See Parkinson and Gerard.)\r\nThese libanotides, however, must be distinguished from “the libanotis,\r\ncalled rosmarinus by the Romans,” which was the well-known _Rosmarinus\r\nofficinalis_, and of which the flower, known by the name of _anthos_, was\r\nin frequent use as a medicine in the age of Sydenham, and still retains\r\na place in our Dispensatory. We have been obliged to enter with more\r\nlength than usual into the general literature of this subject, to prevent\r\nthe mistake of confounding the _cachrys_ with the _rosmarinus_, which\r\nmight be readily done, if the distinction now adverted to had not been\r\nclearly pointed out. Dioscorides recommends the libanotides for various\r\nmedicinal purposes, as being emmenagogue, diuretic, and discutient. Our\r\nauthor’s character of them is mostly taken from Galen. The Arabians treat\r\nobscurely and confusedly of this subject. See particularly Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 67); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 71); Serapion (c. 327.) Rhases says of\r\nthe rosemary, that it is calefacient and attenuant, and hence proves\r\ncarminative, diuretic, and emmenagogue. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\nthe _Rosmarinus officinalis_ stands as the representative of the\r\nλιβανωτὶς. (Athens, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιβανωτὸς,\r\n\r\nThus, _Frankincense_ is heating in the second order, and desiccative\r\nin the first. It has also a slight sub-astringency. The bark of it is\r\nperceptibly astringent. It is, therefore, desiccative in the second\r\ndegree complete. Consisting of thicker matter than the frankincense, and\r\nbeing less acrid, it cures hæmoptysis, dysentery, cæliac and stomachic\r\naffections, both externally and when taken internally. The green shoot of\r\nit is heating and desiccative in the third degree. It is also somewhat\r\ndetergent, by which property it cleanses and fills ulcers in the eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is still by no means satisfactorily determined what tree\r\nit is which produces the frankincense; but the best authorities are\r\nnow inclined to think that it is the _Boswellia turifera_. See Pereira\r\n(Mat. Med., 1185); Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 78); and Lindley (Veg. Kingd.\r\n459.) Dioscorides says the best kind of incense is “the male,” by which\r\nthe ancients meant the purest kind of it, or that consisting of the\r\nlarger grains. See Gray (Pharmacop. 200.) The Indian is of an inferior\r\nquality. He calls it heating, astringent, and cleansing; and recommends\r\nit in hemorrhages, recent wounds, burns, chilblains, and other diseases\r\nof a like nature. He gives minute directions for the use of it in\r\nfumigations. The bark of the frankincense tree he recommends in fluxes\r\nand hemorrhages, and in ulcers of the eyes. The _manna_ of frankincense\r\nwill be explained by us under that head. (Mat. Med. i, 81-3.) Oribasius\r\ngives a perfectly similar account of the frankincense; indeed, he\r\navowedly copies from Dioscorides. (Med. Collect. xi.) Our author’s\r\naccount is mostly taken from Galen. On the _Thus_ see further Pliny (H.\r\nN. xii, 30) and Rhases (Contin. xxxvii, § 716.) Most of the ancient\r\nauthorities affirm that it acts beneficially in mental disease, that it\r\nsharpens perception, and improves the memory. They also recommend it in\r\nfumigations for removing the pestilential constitution of the atmosphere,\r\nas we have stated in the Second Book. Symeon Seth, mostly borrowing from\r\nGalen and our author, says, under the head of frankincense, that it is\r\nof a drying nature, with a certain astringent quality; that it binds the\r\nbowels; in fumigations helps coughs and defluxions; is emmenagogue both\r\nwhen drunk and applied per vaginam; that in fumigations it is possessed\r\nof powers for averting the pestilence; and hence in a pestilential season\r\nthat houses should be diligently fumigated with it, in order to correct\r\nthe pernicious quality of the air. The Arabians used it very freely as\r\nan ingredient in their applications to ulcers, including those of the\r\neyes. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 525) and Serapion (c. 278.) Averrhoes, like\r\npreceding authorities, recommends the bark in fluxes, hæmoptysis, and\r\nulceration of the intestines. (Collig. v. 42.) The frankincense occurs\r\nfrequently in the treatises contained in the Hippocratic collection, and\r\nin the works of Celsus. The latter used all the kinds mentioned by the\r\nGreeks, such as, “thus masculum,” “fuligo thuris,” and “cortex thuris.”\r\nThese he uses for the same purposes as the Greeks, that is to say, for\r\nsuppressing bleeding, concocting pus, cleansing sores, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιγνὺς,\r\n\r\nFuligo, _the Soot_ arising from certain kinds of substances when they are\r\nburnt, such as frankincense, myrrh, turpentine, storax, liquid pitch, and\r\ncedar, is desiccative, terrene, and attenuate: but there are varieties\r\nof it agreeably to the material that is burnt. It is used for ophthalmic\r\nremedies and those for adorning the eyebrows. That which is most used\r\nis the soot from frankincense, as being the mildest; and again, that\r\nfrom the pine, wild pine and pitch tree, as being the strongest. It is\r\napplied, therefore, for baldness of the eyebrows, and for watery and\r\nulcerated canthi of the eyelids, and weeping eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Little need be said under this head. Pliny recommends it\r\nalong with vinegar as an application to erysipelas. Galen recommends it\r\nin the same cases as our author. He defines the _soot_ to be the remains\r\nof the fire which consumed the _materiel_. Serapion’s account of it\r\nis entirely taken from Galen. Dioscorides (i, 84) and Oribasius (Med.\r\nCollect. xi) describe more minutely than any of the others the process\r\nfor preparing the _Fuligo Thuris_. It was used principally in ulcers of\r\nthe eyes. The soot of storax and myrrh, as Serapion says, is prepared\r\nagreeably to the same process as that of frankincense.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιγυστικὸν,\r\n\r\nLigusticum, _Lovage_; the root and seed of it are heating to such a\r\ndegree as to promote menstruation. It is also very carminative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have always thought that the _Ligusticum Levisticum_ had\r\nbeen introduced into this country by the Romans, in order to supply them\r\nwith an article frequently used by them at home, as a condiment. See\r\nthe works of Apicius (pluries.) Dioscorides describes it minutely, and\r\nrecommends it in a great variety of complaints, as an emmenagogue and\r\ndiuretic, to promote digestion and dispel flatulence. He also mentions\r\nthat it was often used as a condiment in place of pepper. (iii, 51.)\r\nGalen and the other Greek authorities treat of it very succinctly. The\r\nArabians ascribe to it anthelminthic and alexipharmic powers. See in\r\nparticular Avicenna (ii, 2, 377); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. iii, 17.) It is\r\nnot met with in the works of Celsus, nor, as far as we can discover, in\r\nthose of Hippocrates. Lovage held a place in the Materia Medica with all\r\nits ancient characters down to a late date. See the works of Parkinson,\r\nGerard, Culpeper, Rutty, and Quincy. It holds a place in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia (97.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιθάργυρος,\r\n\r\nSpuma Argenti, _Litharge_, is of the middle order among metallic\r\nsubstances; we therefore often use it as the vehicle for other remedial\r\npowers. It is moderately desiccative, detergent, and astringent; hence it\r\nis used for excoriations of the thighs from friction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient Litharge was nowise different from the modern,\r\nbeing a secondary product in the cupellation of argentiferous lead. It\r\nwas, therefore, a protoxide of lead. The varieties of it known to the\r\nancients, and their modes of preparing it, are circumstantially described\r\nby Pliny (H. N. xxxiii, 35), Dioscorides (v, 72), and Oribasius (Med.\r\nCollect. xiii.) It was used by the Hippocratists in the practice of\r\nmedicine. (De Morb. Mulier. ii.) It is the “Spuma Argenti” of Celsus,\r\nwho notices it in various parts of his works as a cooling and cleansing\r\nmedicine. (v, 290.) Dioscorides merely says of it, that washed litharge\r\nseems to suit ophthalmic remedies, unseemly cicatrices, wrinkled faces,\r\nand maculæ. (v, 102.) Our author condenses what Galen says under this\r\nhead. The Arabian authorities treat of it fully, but supply little or\r\nno additional information respecting it. See Serapion (De Simpl. 410);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 460); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 428.) They recommend it generally as an astringent in fetor of the\r\narmpits, to restrain copious perspiration, to dispel extravasated blood,\r\nand remove unseemly cicatrices, and especially the marks of variolæ and\r\nmorbilli. It does not appear that any of the physicians administered it\r\ninternally; but Avicenna mentions that he had known women give it in\r\nfluxes and ulceration of the intestines. Ebn Baithar is very full on this\r\nhead (ii, 513.) One of his Arabian authorities, Ibn Ben Amram, recommends\r\nit in diarrhœa, as a clyster to stop the discharge; and mixed up with\r\nvinegar and rose-oil, it is said to be useful in congenital hernia and\r\nother complaints about the scrotum.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛίθοι,\r\n\r\nLapides, _Stones_; all kinds are desiccative like earth; but the\r\nHæmatites, or _Blood-stone_, is astringent and desiccative in a\r\nconsiderable degree, so that it agrees with trachoma of the eyelids,\r\nand if they are free from inflammation it is to be used with water; but\r\nif inflamed, with an egg. It is drunk also with advantage for spitting\r\nof blood; and it restrains the fungous flesh of ulcers. The _Schistos_\r\nor _Scissilis_ has similar properties, but is weaker: and after it the\r\nGalactites, or _Milk-stone_. The Melititis, or _Honey-stone_, has also\r\na certain degree of heat. The Moroxus (called also Leucographis), being\r\nso much softer than the others, and possessing no active quality,\r\nis much more mild, and occasions less pain; it is, therefore, used\r\nas an application to the soft parts of the body with cerate for the\r\ncicatrization of ulcers. The greenish _Jasper_, being possessed of\r\nstronger powers, attenuates cicatrices and pterygia. The Green Jasper\r\nis useful in stomach complaints, when appended as an amulet, and when\r\nworn in a ring. That called the _Judaic-stone_ breaks renal calculi,\r\nand hence the moderns have called it Tecolithos. The _Pyrites_ acts as\r\na powerful discutient of tumours and coagula; and when it is not at\r\nhand, the _Molaris_ may be used instead. The _Phrygian_, in addition to\r\nbeing powerfully desiccative, has also some astringency and pungency;\r\nhence it is repellent and discutient, and is therefore mixed up with\r\nophthalmic remedies. The _Ageratus_, being possessed of astringent and\r\ndiscutient powers, is of use in inflammations of the uvula. The flower\r\nof the _Asian-stone_ is composed of so subtile parts that it corrodes\r\nflabby flesh without pungency. The _Gagate-stone_, being considerably\r\ndesiccative, agrees principally with chronic cases of emphysema. The\r\n_Magnet_ (called also the Heraclean-stone) has similar powers to the\r\nHæmatites. The _Arabian-stone_ is like ivory, desiccative and detergent.\r\nSome give those affected with stomach complaints a draught composed of\r\nburnt _Alabaster_. The Smeris, _Emery_, having detergent powers, cleanses\r\nthe teeth. The stones found in _Sponges_ break down renal calculi; and\r\nthose formed on the Argæan mountain of Cappadocia are possessed of\r\nsimilar powers, and in like manner the stone called _Ophites_, which is\r\nappended as an amulet with advantage to those bitten by the viper. The\r\n_Ostracites_ and _Geodes_ are said to be considerably desiccative so as\r\nto cure inflammatory swellings. The Retrimentum Naxiæ cotis, _filings\r\nof the Naxian Whetstone_, is said to be refrigerant, so as to repress\r\nthe breasts of virgins, and the testicles of children. The filings of\r\nthe _Cos oleraria_, being detergent, suit with alopecia. It is said that\r\nthe _Hieracites_ and _Indian-stone_, when appended as amulets, stop\r\nthe discharge of blood from hemorrhoids, and that the _Sapphire_, when\r\ndrunk, relieves persons bitten by the scorpion, and the _Aphroselinum_,\r\nepileptics. The _Armenian-stone_ purges the belly downwards, but is\r\nprejudicial to the stomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following account of the stones used by the ancients in\r\nthe practice of medicine is derived from a careful study of the ancient\r\nwriters on this subject, especially Theophrastus, Pliny, Orpheus, and\r\nPsellus. We have also availed ourselves freely of the labours of the\r\nmodern commentators who have written on these ancient authors, namely, De\r\nLaet, De Boet, Marbodeus, Hill, and others. For a fuller description of\r\nsome of the articles, we would beg to refer to our Appendix to Dunbar’s\r\nEnglish and Greek Lexicon.\r\n\r\nThe _Hæmatites_ or _Blood-stone_ was so called from its colour, or\r\nbecause it was used as a styptic for stopping hemorrhages, as stated by\r\nGalen. It consists principally of the oxide of iron. Professor Cleaveland\r\nsays it contains from 60 to 80 per cent. of iron of excellent quality.\r\nIt was used for the cure of ophthalmy. See Dioscorides (v, 143); Galen\r\n(De Simpl. ix); Serapion (De Simpl. 421.) They also recommend it in\r\nmenorrhagia. Alexander praises it in hæmoptysis. Averrhoes recommends it\r\nin diseases of the eyelids and eyes. (Collig. iv, 43.) Dr. Hill says it\r\nis accounted astringent and desiccative. He adds, “it is given from 10\r\nto 25 grains in hemorrhages and in distemperatures of the eyes.” Besides\r\nthis, the ancients were acquainted with another Blood-stone which they\r\ncall Heliotrope.\r\n\r\nThe _Schistos_ is only a variety of the hæmatites, having a fibrous\r\nappearance and ochre colour. Pliny says it is used in diseases of the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe _Lapis Melitites_ of Pliny is supposed by Dr. Kidd to have been\r\nborax, or the borate of soda. Pliny recommends it mixed with wax for\r\nulcers of the throat. (H. N. xxxvi, 33.) See Isidorus (Orig. xvi, 4.) It\r\nseems likely that it was the same as the tincar of the Arabians, although\r\non this point we do not venture to pronounce a decided opinion. One of\r\nSerapion’s authorities speaks highly of it in caries of the teeth, and\r\nsays it kills the worms in them. Is this the original of the popular\r\nbelief, that toothache is connected with worms in the teeth? (De Simpl.\r\n423.)\r\n\r\nThe _Galactites_ most probably consisted principally of chalk. Matthiolus\r\nand Sprengel mention that it is found in Saxony. Dr. Hill remarks that\r\nit is, properly speaking, a species of indurated clay, and not a stone.\r\nDr. Jameson conjectures that it may have been Fuller’s earth. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as a liniment in defluxions of the eyes. (v, 149.)\r\n\r\nThe _Morochthus_, according to Sprengel, is called _Speckstein_ and\r\n_Seifenstein_ in German. It consists of talc, argil, and silica, with a\r\nsmall proportion of iron and manganese. Dr. Hill says it is an indurated\r\nclay, and is now known by the name of _French chalk_. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it in hæmoptysis, cæliac affections, and pains of the bladder;\r\nand for the cure of fluor albus on pessaries. (v, 151.) Avicenna speaks\r\nfavorably of it also in fistula lachrymalis. (ii, 2, 431.)\r\n\r\nThe _Achates_, or Agate, is well described by Orpheus, and recommended as\r\na remedy for fever and various other complaints. It does not seem to be\r\nnoticed by the medical authorities.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with several varieties of _Jasper_.\r\nSee Pliny (H. N. xxxvii, 37.) They contained talc and various other\r\ningredients. Dioscorides recommends it solely as a phylactery _or_ amulet\r\nto expedite delivery. (v, 159.) Galen and Avicenna speak of its being\r\nuseful as an amulet in affections of the stomach and bowels. The latter\r\ncalls it _Lapis aneseb_. (ii, 2, 408.) Even in modern times the Jasper\r\nhas been celebrated as an amulet. See Andreas Laurentius (De Mirab.\r\nStrum. Sanat. 69), and Hill (Mat. Med. 276.)\r\n\r\nThe _Judaic-stone_ appears to be the Tecolithos of Pliny. It is now\r\nascertained that it is formed from the quills of the _Echinus Marinus_,\r\nimpregnated with calcareous earth, silica, and perhaps some magnesia.\r\nMost of the ancient authorities commend it as a lithontriptic. V.\r\nHarduin in Plin. H. N. xxxvii, 68. Dioscorides recommends it not only\r\nas a lithontriptic medicine, but a remedy for dysuria in general. (v,\r\n154.) Galen and Serapion also affirm that they had experienced good\r\neffects from it when given in calculus of the kidneys or bladder. See in\r\nparticular Serapion (c. 390.) Rhases, however, affirms that he had tried\r\nthe lapis vesicæ, by which he probably means this article, but had not\r\nfound it to be lithontriptic. (Cont. l. ult. 414.) Dr. Hill says it is,\r\nundoubtedly, diuretic, but it is not so certain that it is lithontriptic.\r\n\r\nThe _Pyrites_, when burnt, forms an oxide of copper with sulphur. From\r\nour author’s account, it is evident that the Molaris nearly resembled\r\nit, and the same may be understood from Pliny. It will, of course, be\r\nunderstood that it is the copper pyrites, and not the iron. This is\r\nvery obvious from the description of it given by Dioscorides. He calls\r\nit heating, detergent, and a cleanser of obscurities of the eyes, and\r\nrecommends it for repressing fungated ulcers. When burnt, he adds, some\r\ncall it _diphryges_. It is described under the name of _marchasita_ by\r\nSerapion (c. 395), Phases (Cont. l. ult. i, 449), and Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n464.) They all recommend it with vinegar in leprosy and other obstinate\r\ndiseases of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe _Phrygian-stone_ was a pumice with alum and some other ingredients.\r\nDioscorides says it has astringent, cleansing, and moderately escharotic\r\npowers, and proves a remedy for burns. (v, 140.) Galen professes to have\r\nhad great experience of it in diseases of the eyes. (Ed. Basil. t. ii,\r\n122, 208.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 405.)\r\n\r\nThe _Ageratus_ does not occur we believe in Dioscorides or Pliny. Galen\r\ncalls it a stone which the curriers of leather use. He says it is\r\nastringent and acrid, and recommends it particularly in inflamed uvula.\r\nAvicenna copies from him. (ii, 2, 409.)\r\n\r\nThe _Anthrax_ or _Carbuncle_ of the ancients comprehended the ruby and\r\na multitude of other gems of the same colour. It was scarcely used in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nDe Boet says that the _Asian-stone_ is light and spongy, and contains\r\nalum, nitre, and salt. Dioscorides calls it slightly septic and\r\ndiscutient, and recommends it as an application to old, and more\r\nespecially fungated, ulcers, and those of a malignant nature. The flower\r\nof it, by which was meant an efflorescence on the surface of it, he says\r\ndoes good in phthisis. He further says of it, that a hip-bath prepared\r\nwith it is highly beneficial in the cure of gout. (v, 141.) Galen and the\r\nother authorities treat of it in more general terms. (De Simpl. ix.) See\r\nalso Serapion, who merely copies from Dioscorides and Galen. (c. 393.)\r\n\r\nThe _Amethyst_ of our times is the same gem that the ancients knew by\r\nthis name. Except that it was suspended from the neck as an amulet to\r\nprevent drunkenness, we are not aware that it was used in medicine. See\r\nPliny (H. N. xxxvii, 40); Marbodeus (De Lapid. 4.)\r\n\r\nThe _Gagate_ is a fossil, bituminous substance, containing carbon and\r\nethereal oil. It is jet. The _Thracian-stone_ was similar to it; indeed,\r\nwe suppose, a variety of it. The Gagate was used by the ancients as a\r\ntest of epilepsy, and a restorative from hysterical fits. Galen gives\r\nan interesting account of his experience in the medicinal use of gagate\r\nand Thracian-stone, the result of which is, that he found gagate rather\r\nto weaken than increase the powers of the bitumen which he had picked up\r\nupon the shores of the Dead Sea; but that as a desiccant, it operated\r\nbeneficially in the cure of sores, and that not only of recent, but also\r\nof sinuous ulcers. (De Simpl. ix.) He mentions that he could not discover\r\nthe river Gagas in Lycia, from which, according to Dioscorides, this\r\nstone derives its name. (Ibid.) There is an interesting description of\r\nthe Thracian-stone in a passage of Nicander quoted by Galen, under this\r\nhead, _Theriac_. (45.) The Arabians who treat of it merely copy from the\r\nGreeks. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 399, 400), and Avicenna (ii, 2, 107.)\r\nMesue gives a formula for an oil of gagate. (De Oleis, i.)\r\n\r\nAristotle suggests that perhaps the _Magnet_ is animated. (De Anima.)\r\nTo comprehend his reasons for maintaining this singular opinion,\r\nit would be necessary to understand his theory of motion, as fully\r\nexposed in his ‘Auscultationes Naturales.’ Lucretius, with considerable\r\ningenuity, attempts to explain the manner in which the magnet attracts\r\niron. (vi, 1000.) Plato (in Timæo) and Hippocrates (De Sterilibus) also\r\nallude to its attractive property. Galen recommends it in dropsies.\r\nDioscorides, Galen, and the other Greek authorities treat of it in a\r\nvery cursory manner, merely stating of it that it has the same virtues\r\nas the hæmatite. The Arabians, more especially Serapion, give a much\r\nfuller description of it, which at all events identifies the Magnetis or\r\nHeraclean-stone of the ancients with our loadstone, that is to say, the\r\nmagnetic oxide of iron. It was used by the Arabians as an application to\r\npoisoned wounds. See Serapion (De Simpl. 394); Avicenna (ii, 2, 463.)\r\nIt was used in the practice of medicine from the earliest date. See\r\nHippocrates (De Sterilibus.) Ebn Baithar recommends it in pains of the\r\nhead and feet, if taken hold of, and in cramps. He copies Aëtius. (ii,\r\n25.)\r\n\r\nThe _Arabian-stone_ is a species of white marble. It is recommended by\r\nDioscorides for hemorrhoids and as a dentifrice. (v, 145.)\r\n\r\nThe _Alabastrites_ is a thick concrete gypsum. See Kidd’s ‘Mineral.’\r\n(i, 63.) Galen says of it, that when burned it is adapted for medicinal\r\nuse, and that it is sometimes administered in a draught to persons\r\naffected with stomach complaints. Dioscorides speaks of its being applied\r\nexternally in such cases along with wax; calls it discutient, and says\r\nit represses the gums. (v, 152.) It would appear that this article is\r\nthe Lapis eburneus of Rhases, who calls it an astringent and dentifrice.\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 395.)\r\n\r\nGeoffroy says that the Smiris is the _Emery_ of the shops. It is held\r\nby the mineralogists to be a variety of Corundam. See Cleaveland’s\r\n‘Mineral.’ (278.) A specimen of it, from the Isle of Naxos (which may\r\nbe supposed a good representation of the ancient Smiris), was found\r\nby Tennant to consist principally of alumine, with small proportions\r\nof silex and oxide of iron. Dioscorides recommends it in looseness of\r\nthe gums, and as a dentifrice; he ranks it with septic and caustic\r\nsubstances. (v, 165.)\r\n\r\nThe _Stones in Sponges_ consist principally of the muriate of lime. They\r\nwere much commended as lithontriptics. See Dioscorides, Pliny, Galen, and\r\nAvicenna.\r\n\r\nThe _Ophites_ is a pellucid stone, so called from its serpentine streaks.\r\nIt was that variety of serpentine called _verde antico_. See Jameson’s\r\n‘Mineralogy.’ According to Dioscorides, it was useful as an amulet in the\r\ncase of persons stung by snakes, and was also reported to be useful in\r\nlethargy and headache. (v, 161.) Galen holds it to be lithontriptic. (De\r\nSimpl. viii.) The Arabians copy from Dioscorides and Galen. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 406.)\r\n\r\nThe _Ostracites_ appears to have been petrified oysters. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it in menorrhagia, in inflamed breasts, and spreading sores.\r\n(v, 164.) Galen also recommends it for clearing the cornea. (De Simpl.\r\nviii.) See in like manner Avicenna (ii, 2, 393.)\r\n\r\nThe _Geodes_ contains iron, argil, and silica. It is nearly allied to the\r\nEagle-stone, and hence it is often called the Bastard Eagle-stone. See\r\nHill’s ‘Theophrastus.’ Dioscorides recommends it as an ophthalmic remedy,\r\nand as a liniment for inflammations of the mammæ and testicles. (v,\r\n168.) Avicenna says the vapour of vinegar in which it is dissolved checks\r\nthe flow of blood and cures hot aspostemes. (ii, 2, 398.)\r\n\r\nMatthiolus confesses himself quite unacquainted with the _Naxian\r\nWhetstone_. Sprengel reckons it allied to the Smiris. Galen would rather\r\nseem to make it a variety of the Ostracites.\r\n\r\nThe _Lapis Lyncurius_ of the ancients was our Jacinth or Hyacinth.\r\nSee Beckmann, and De Laet, ‘de gemmis.’ Dioscorides recommends it in\r\naffections of the stomach and bowels. (ii, 100.) Serapion describes\r\nminutely the _Lapis iacinctus_, or hyacinth, but merely mentions of it\r\nthat it was used as a seal to avert the thunderbolt. (c. 398.) The stone\r\nwhich he describes in the following chapter, would appear decidedly to be\r\nthe Tourmaline. He calls it Lapis rubeus, _seu_, _hager albuzedi_. Used\r\nas a seal, he says it dispels bad dreams.\r\n\r\nThe _Cos_ is composed of a schistose argil. The _Cos Olearia_ would\r\nappear to have derived its name from requiring the use of oil to answer\r\nthe purpose of whetstone. See Pliny (H. N. xxxvi, 47.)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine accurately the nature of the _Hieracites_.\r\nAëtius, who has given the fullest account of it, describes it as a\r\ndarkish green stone.\r\n\r\nThe _Indian-stone_ would seem to be identical with the Arabian-stone.\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. 401.)\r\n\r\nThe _Lydian-stone_ is ranked by Dr. Thomson as a sub-species of\r\nFlint-slate. He remarks that it was used as a touchstone by the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe _Ætites_, or _Eagle-stone_, is a species of oxide of iron. Dr. Hill\r\nremarks that custom has given the name of ætites to every fossil that\r\nhas a loose nucleus within it. The ancients used it very frequently as\r\nan amulet and incantation. See particularly Dioscorides and Aëtius. The\r\nArabians also confirm, in the strongest terms, the imaginary efficacy of\r\nthe Eagle-stone when used as an amulet. That it accelerated the delivery\r\nof woman in tedious labours, Serapion and Rhases declare, from ample\r\nexperience, and that it would produce this beneficial effect on those who\r\nhad faith in it _we_ can readily believe. Indeed, we have often regretted\r\nthat such innocent modes of working upon the imagination of women in\r\nlabour had given place to more dangerous methods of practice in such\r\ncases. The Eagle-stone was retained in the English Dispensatory with all\r\nits ancient characters as late as Quincy. (165.)\r\n\r\nThe _Thyites_, according to Fuchsius, was a Turquoise; but Matthiolus is\r\nof a different opinion. Sprengel thinks it may have been a species of\r\nturquoise, although not the common one. Dr. Hill says it contains a small\r\nquantity of copper, which rendered it a valuable ingredient in collyria.\r\nIt is prescribed for this purpose by Dioscorides. (v, 153.)\r\n\r\nThe _Amiantus_ is composed of talc, calcareous and siliceous earth, clay,\r\nand a small proportion of iron. It is often confounded with the _Alumen\r\nplumosum_ of the ancients, to which it is compared by Dioscorides. He\r\ndoes not mention any medicinal use to which it was applied, but merely\r\nstates of it that it was used for forming the _linum asbestinum_. (v,\r\n155.) See further Harduin in Plin. H. N. (xxxvi, 31.)\r\n\r\nThe _Sapphirus_ of the ancients is supposed by Beckmann to have been\r\nthe Lapis lazuli. (History of Inventions.) This opinion is now pretty\r\ngenerally established, and yet there is a difficulty attending it;\r\nfor the Arabians, in treating of the _Lapis lazuli_, do not quote the\r\ndescriptions of the sapphirus given by Dioscorides and Galen, but\r\napparently refer to the _cyanus_. Dioscorides recommends the sapphirus\r\nas an alexipharmic, and a remedy for internal ulcerations and diseases\r\nof the eyes. (v, 156.) Galen merely recommends it as an antidote to the\r\nstings of scorpions. Rhases, under the head of “Lapis lazuli,” quotes\r\nDioscorides as saying of it that it promotes the growth of the eyelashes,\r\nthat it restrains fungous flesh, is septic, caustic, and ulcerative; and\r\nGalen, as saying of it, that it has abstergent powers, with a moderate\r\ndegree of attenuating and styptic virtues; that it may be mixed in\r\ncollyria for the eyes, and especially for the eyelids when affected with\r\nsharp humours, which it represses, and also prevents the growth of the\r\nhairs. (Cont. l. ult. i, 404.) See also Serapion (c. 389); Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 43); and Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 45.)\r\n\r\nThe _Calais_ of Pliny and the ancients is said by Dr. Hill to be the\r\n_Turquoise_, or _Gemma Turcica_, which consists principally of lime and\r\niron. See the Thyites.\r\n\r\nThe _Memphites_ contains bitumen and ethereal oil. It is the\r\nretinasphaltum of Mr. Hatchett, or retinite of Jameson. (Mineral, iii,\r\n478.) According to Dioscorides, when rubbed smoothly upon places about\r\nto be burnt or cut, it renders them insensible without danger. (v, 157.)\r\n\r\nThe _Selenites_ consists principally of a compact lamellated gypsum.\r\nAccording to Eustathius, it is the same as the _Lychnitis_, which\r\nDionysius the geographer describes as resembling fire in lustre. (Orbis.\r\nDescrip. 328.) It is soft, pellucid, and colourless. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes it minutely, and mentions of it that it was given as a draught\r\nto epileptics, and used as a phylactery by women. He adds, that it was\r\nalso appended to trees in order to make them keep their fruit. (v,\r\n158.) Rhases, under the head of “lapis lunaris,” copies this chapter of\r\nDioscorides. (Cont. l. ult. i, 405.)\r\n\r\nThe _Lapis Specularis_ was the same as the Moscovy talc. It was much\r\nused by the ancients for windows in place of glass. It is a variety of\r\nselenite, or sparry gypsum. See Kidd and Jameson. We have treated of it\r\nunder the head of Gypsum in the Fifth Book.\r\n\r\nThe _Smaragdus_ of the ancients is unquestionably referable to our\r\nemerald, but there is every reason to believe, also comprehended coloured\r\ncrystals and certain stones of the jasper kind. It does not occur in the\r\nworks of Dioscorides or Galen; and, as far as we know, Aëtius is the\r\nfirst medical author who describes it. He says of it, that when roasted\r\nand levigated with Attic honey, it cures dimness of vision; that it is\r\nmost useful in elephantiasis, both externally and internally; and that\r\nas an amulet it restrains bleeding. (ii, 39.) We are not aware that any\r\nother ancient authority, whether Greek, Roman, or Arabian, has noticed it.\r\n\r\nWe will treat of the _Bezoar-stone_ and _Gall-stone_ of the bull in the\r\nAppendix to this section.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛιθόσπερμον (called also λειόσπορμον ἢ ἡράκλειον),\r\n\r\nLithospermon, _Gromwel_, is the seed of the herb called Aegonychus, of\r\na stony hardness, and white, which, when drunk with white wine, proves\r\nlithontriptic and diuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Lithospermum officinale_, or\r\n_Gromwel_. Pliny expresses himself respecting it in the following\r\nterms: “Nec quidquam inter herbas majore quidem miraculo aspexi. Tantus\r\nest decor, velut aurificum arte alternis inter folia candicantibus\r\nmargaritis: tam exquisita difficultas lapidis ex herba nascentis.” (H.\r\nN. xxvii, 74.) Dioscorides describes it minutely, and, like our author,\r\ncalls it lithontriptic and diuretic. (iii, 148.) Serapion and Avicenna\r\ngive it the same characters, which it maintained in modern times, as\r\nlong as it held a place in the Dispensatory. See the works of Parkinson,\r\nCulpeper, and Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛινόσπερμον,\r\n\r\nLini Semen, _Linseed_, is heating in the first order, and holds the\r\nmiddle rank of diluents and desiccants. When eaten, it is flatulent, even\r\nalthough roasted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the seed of the _Linum usitatissimum_, Angl. _Linseed_.\r\nDioscorides gives a long account of its medicinal virtues, recommending\r\nit externally for ephelides, vari, and other complaints, and internally\r\nas an expectorant and aphrodisiacal medicine. He further commends it\r\nas an enema in pains of the bowels and womb, and as a hip-bath in\r\ninflammations of the uterus. (ii, 125.) Galen, like our author, treats\r\nof it in very general terms. The Arabians, and especially Avicenna, give\r\na more circumstantial account of it. (ii, 2, 598.) See Serapion (c. 21);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. 426.) Like Dioscorides, they recommend it as an\r\nexternal application to apostemes of a hard character, and internally for\r\nthe cure of diseases of the chest and intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛινόζωστις,\r\n\r\nMercurialis, the herb _Mercury_, is considerably laxative of the belly,\r\nand applied in cataplasms it is discutient. It ought to be known that\r\nwhen its seed is rubbed upon those preternatural excrescences of the\r\nbody, which the vulgar call narphia, it is found to make them disappear.\r\nBut the seed must be green, and they must be often rubbed with it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Most of the botanical authorities agree that it is the\r\n_Mercurialis annua_, L. It occurs frequently in the Hippocratic treatises\r\nas an article of diet and gentle laxative. Dioscorides, who describes it\r\nin two separate places of his Materia Medica, (iii, 130 and iv, 188),\r\nspeaks of it as being a laxative pot-herb, and a medicine of which the\r\ndecoction in water proves cholagogue and hydragogue. He also alludes to\r\nthe popular notion that the leaves of the female plant, when applied to\r\na woman’s parts of generation after her menstrual period, will promote\r\nconception of a female, while those of the male plant will promote\r\nconception of a male. It does not occur in the works of Celsus, nor,\r\nas far as we can discover, in those of any of the Arabians, with the\r\nexception of Averrhoes, who calls it a gentle purgative of the same class\r\nas Cassia fistula, tamarinds, and the like, and says it evacuates yellow\r\nbile and phlegm; and boiled in wine proves an excellent application\r\nto large sores, and in particular to the ulcers produced by burns. He\r\nfurther recommends its leaves boiled in vinegar for diseases of the\r\nspleen, and its flower in a masticatory and errhine. (Collig. v, 42.)\r\nWhat our author says of its virtues in the diseases called _narphia_,\r\nby the vulgar, is taken from Aëtius (i), where, however, the reading\r\nis _carphia_. Galen says of it, “everybody uses the herb mercury for\r\npurging the belly.” (De Simpl. Med.) Notwithstanding this testimony,\r\nwhich is, in fact, confirmed by that of all the ancient writers who have\r\ntreated of it, Bergius says, “Virtus suspecta: vis emolliens nondum ritè\r\nnobis constat.” However, Moses Charras, who appears to have written from\r\nexperience, affirms of it that “it loosens the belly, and provokes the\r\nmenstruums. The dose is from oz. j to iij.” (Roy. Pharm. 106.) Alston\r\nlikewise acknowledges its laxative powers. Dr. Hill says of it, “This\r\nplant is of an emollient nature, and is eaten by many people in the\r\nmanner of spinach, which, when cultivated in the garden, it greatly\r\nexcels. If eaten largely it gently opens the bowels.” (Mat. Med.) It held\r\na place in our Dispensatory as late as Quincy. (106.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛίτρον,\r\n\r\nNitrum, _Nitre_ (or _Soda_?), is possessed of intermediate powers between\r\nthe aphronitrum and salts. When burnt it becomes more attenuate and\r\ndiscutient. If taken internally it cuts and attenuates the thick and\r\nviscid humours more than any other. The Chalestræan (so called from\r\nChalestra, a place in Thessalonica) is more acrid and desiccative,\r\nso that it is used for defluxions from the head, and for arthritic\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following extract from Pliny’s description of the\r\nnitrum clearly indicates the substance to which he applies it: “Non\r\nest differenda et nitri natura, non multum a sale distans. Exiguum fit\r\napud Medos, canescentibus siccitate convallibus, quod vocant halmyrhaga.\r\nOptimum copiosumque in Litis Macedoniæ quod vocant Chalestricum,\r\ncandidum, purumque, proximum sali. Lacus est nitrosus, exsiliente e\r\nmedio dulci fonticulo. In Ægypto autem conficitur multo abundantius, sed\r\ndeterius. Fit pæne eodem modo quo sol, nisi quod salinis mare infundunt,\r\nNilum autem nitrariis.” (H. N. xxxi, 46.) Compare the above with the\r\nfollowing account of the native carbonate of soda: “In Egypt it is\r\nplentifully found in what are called _the Lakes of Natron_. These lakes,\r\nsix in number, are westward of the Nile, not far from Terrana, in a\r\nvalley surrounded by limestone. The carbonate and muriate of soda exist\r\ntogether in these waters; but when the water is diminished by natural\r\nevaporation, these salts are deposited in distinct layers.” (Brogniart,\r\nin Cleaveland’s Mineral., 133.) It would be superfluous to bring any\r\nfurther proof that the ancient nitrum generally applies to our natron\r\nor the native carbonate of soda. Were the Greeks, Romans, and Arabians\r\nthen entirely ignorant of saltpetre or the nitrate of potash? This seems\r\nincredible, considering how largely it is distributed in Europe, Asia,\r\nand Africa; and, therefore, we cannot bring ourselves to think that this\r\nmineral can have entirely escaped the observation of the ancients; and\r\nif this were the proper place for such a disquisition, we believe that\r\nwe could state satisfactory reasons for drawing the conclusion, that\r\n“nitrum” was applied to it as well as to the other mineral. But at the\r\nsame time, as mentioned above, we are quite satisfied that by _litrum_\r\nand _nitrum_ the medical authors generally, if not universally, meant\r\nthe native carbonate of soda. Dioscorides, with regard to its medicinal\r\npowers, merely states of it that it has alterative or metasyncritic\r\npowers. (v, 129.) We have given his views respecting the _Aphronitrum_\r\nunder that head. Our author abridges Galen’s account of it, but omits to\r\nmention, as stated by Galen, and also by Aëtius, that the different kinds\r\nof nitre were popularly used as counter-agents in cases of poisoning by\r\nmushrooms. All the Arabians treat largely of this substance generally\r\nunder the name of _baurach_. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 84); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult, iii, 115); Mesue (De Simpl. xvii); Serapion (c. 401); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 46, 487); Ebn Baithar (i, 187.) Rhases marks what it is:\r\n“Nitrum appellatur Arabicè natrum et est simile sali gemmæ.” (Cont.\r\nl. ult. ii, 508.) They used it externally for the cure of prurigo and\r\nscabies, and as an application to diseased joints, and along with figs\r\nto remove dropsical swellings. They recommend an injection of it into\r\nthe ear for the cure of deafness. The aphronitrum, or African nitrum,\r\nis said by Avicenna to be possessed of emetic powers, and that it was\r\nmore incisive of gross humours than the other varieties of it. It was\r\nused by them in cases of poisoning with mushrooms, cantharides, and\r\nbull’s blood; and as an application to the bites of mad dogs. Mesue, with\r\nhis wonted precision, states its powers very distinctly, recommending\r\nit, when given by the mouth, in clysters, and in suppositories as an\r\nevacuant of crude and viscid phlegm, for colic and affections of the\r\nstomach. Like Avicenna, he says that it will sometimes occasion vomiting.\r\nHis commentator, Costa, has many ingenious observations on the ancient\r\nnitrum, which will be found very interesting to those who desire to\r\nbecome better acquainted with this subject. Haly Abbas states that\r\nfriction with it before the hour of invasion will prevent an attack of\r\nague.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛόγχιτις,\r\n\r\nLonchitis, _Rough Spleenwort_; the root of that species which has\r\ntriangular seed, like a spear, resembles that of the carrot, and is\r\ndiuretic. But the green leaves of that species which resembles the\r\nscolopendrium, are agglutinative of wounds; and when dried, and drunk\r\nwith vinegar, they cure indurated spleens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the two species of _Lonchitis_ is\r\ntaken from Dioscorides. Of these, the former, which has been conjectured\r\nto be the _Serapias Lingua_, he says is diuretic. The other, which\r\nwould seem to be the species of _aspidium_, to which the name is still\r\nappropriated, he calls vulnerary and anti-inflammatory, and recommends\r\nfor reducing the size of the spleen. Galen and the other authorities\r\ngive a similar account of it. Such of the Arabians as treat of it follow\r\nDioscorides. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 336.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛύκοψις,\r\n\r\nLycopsis, _Hound’s-tongue_; having an astringent root, Dioscorides says,\r\nthat when applied with polenta in a cataplasm, it agrees with erysipelas,\r\nand that if rubbed in with oil it is sudorific.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is either the _Echium Italicum_, L., or the _Lycopsis\r\nechioides_, L., probably the former. Our author, as he acknowledges,\r\nborrows from Dioscorides. Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius, as well as\r\nHippocrates and Celsus, do not treat of it at all. If the Arabians notice\r\nit, they do so under the head of _Anchusa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛύκιον,\r\n\r\nLycium, _Buckthorn_, is composed of heterogeneous powers, one part\r\nof its ingredients being heating, attenuate, and discutient, and the\r\nother, or terrene part, being cooling and gently astringent; so that it\r\nis desiccative in the second degree, and calefacient and refrigerant\r\nin an intermediate degree. They use it, therefore, as a detergent in\r\nobstructions of the pupil, and as an astringent in cæliac and dysenteric\r\ncases and ill-conditioned ulcers; and in inflammations as a discutient.\r\nThe Indian is the best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives a sufficiently distinct description of the\r\ntree which produces the _lycium_, so as to leave no doubt that he points\r\nto the _Rhamnus infectorius_. The _Lycium Indicum_ of the same author, is\r\nnow satisfactorily determined to be the product of the _Berberis Lycium_.\r\nSee Royle (Antiq. of Hind. Med. 32), and ‘Linn. Transact.’ (xvii, 83);\r\nalso Pereira (Materia Medica, 1152.) Dioscorides recommends the former\r\nof these as an astringent for the cure of various complaints, such as\r\nobscurities of the cornea, psoriasis, and pruritus of the eyelids,\r\npurulent ears and tonsils, ulcers of the gums, chapped lips, fissure\r\nof the anus; in cæliac and dysenteric affections, both in draughts and\r\nclysters; in hæmoptysis and coughs; in female fluxes, hydrophobia, and\r\nso forth. The Indian, he states, cures inflammation of the spleen and\r\njaundice, prevents menstruation, purges water, and is a counter-agent to\r\ndeadly poisons. (i, 132.) Galen’s account of it being nearly the same as\r\nour author’s, we need not expound at any length. He holds that the Indian\r\nspecies is far stronger than the other. (De Simpl. ix.) Oribasius and\r\nAëtius in like manner follow Galen. Celsus recommends lycium strongly\r\nin ulceration of the throat. (iv, 4, 3.) As far as we have been able to\r\ndiscover, it does not occur in the works of Hippocrates. The Arabians\r\ntreat fully of this article. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 429); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 390); Serapion (c. 7); Averrhoes (v, 42.) We do not find that\r\nthey supply any new views regarding its medicinal virtues. In the modern\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia the extract of catechu is set down as being the\r\n_Lycium Indicum_. We agree, however, with the authorities quoted above\r\nregarding it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛυσιμάχιον,\r\n\r\nLysimachium, _Moneywort_; its prevailing power is astringency; hence it\r\nagglutinates wounds, and is styptic, both itself and its juice. It also\r\nrelieves dysentery when drunk and injected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The L. of Dioscorides and our author is most probably the\r\nYellow Loose-strife of our English herbalists, namely, _Lysimachia\r\nvulgaris_, L. Our author abridges Dioscorides, who recommends it as an\r\nastringent in various cases, such as hæmoptysis, dysentery, fluor albus,\r\nhemorrhage from the nose, and as a vulnerary and styptic herb. (iv, 3.)\r\nGalen and Aëtius treat of it in nearly the same words as our author.\r\nWe have not been able to find it in the works of the Arabians, except\r\nEbn Baithar, and yet we do not assert that it may not be treated of\r\nunder some name which we have not been able to interpret. Ebn Baithar\r\nmerely quotes Dioscorides and Galen. The lysimachia, although not now\r\nincluded in our Dispensatories, still holds a place in the shops of\r\nthe apothecaries, with the character of being astringent. See Gray’s\r\nSupplement, &c. (48.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΛυχνὶς,\r\n\r\nLychnis, _Campion_; the seed of that species which is used for garlands\r\nis hot and desiccative, according to the second order complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This plant is the _Lychnis coronaria_ of Dioscorides, and\r\nstill retains this name. Dioscorides recommends it in the case of persons\r\nstung by scorpions. The wild lychnis of Dioscorides may be either the\r\n_Lychnis dioica_ or _Agrostemma githago_; it is said by Dioscorides to\r\nbe a cholagogue, and a remedy in the case of persons stung by scorpions.\r\n(iii, 104-5.) Galen and the other authorities merely state the characters\r\nof the _Lychnis coronaria_ in general terms. We have not found this\r\narticle in any of the Arabians, not even in Ebn Baithar.\r\n\r\n\r\nΛωτὸς,\r\n\r\nLotus, _Bird’s-foot Trefoil_ (?); the cultivated species is by some\r\ncalled trifolium. It is possessed of detergent and moderately desiccative\r\npowers, and is of a proper temperament as to heat. The seed of the wild\r\nlotus belongs to the second order of calefacients, and is also somewhat\r\ndetergent. The seed of the Egyptian lotus is also made into bread.\r\nThe _Lote_, or _Nettle-tree_, consists of subtile particles, and is\r\nmoderately desiccative and astringent. Hence it is applicable for the\r\nfemale fluor, and for fluxes of the bowels, both when drunk with wine or\r\nwater, or when used in an injection. It also strengthens the hairs that\r\nare falling out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We need not enter further into the literary history of this\r\ninteresting subject, which we have given at some length in the Appendix,\r\nalready so often referred to, than to mention that the Lotus, called also\r\nTrifolium, is referable to the _Melilotus officinalis_, and probably\r\nsome of its congeners, and the Lotus Arbor to the _Zizyphus Lotus_, with\r\nperhaps some other trees of the same tribe. Dr. Lindley says of it, “The\r\nLote-bush, which gave its name to the ancient Lotophagi, is to this day\r\ncollected for food by the Arabs of Barbary, who call it sadar, and its\r\nberries nabk.” (Veg. Kingd. 582.) The wild lotus of Dioscorides and the\r\nother authorities has never been satisfactorily determined. Perhaps it\r\nwas the species of _melilotus_ named _cærulea_. The Egyptian lotus, there\r\ncan be no doubt, was the _Nymphæa Lotus_, L. Dioscorides gives a striking\r\ndescription of this last, which, he says, the inhabitants of Egypt\r\nuse for making bread; and it is deserving of remark that the rhizomes\r\nof the nymphæa are still roasted and eaten by the Negroes of Senegal.\r\nSee further under _Nymphæa_ in this section. Our author’s characters\r\nof the other loti are copied from Dioscorides or Galen, who agree, in\r\nthe main, under this head. See, in like manner, Aëtius and Oribasius.\r\nThe Arabians treat at great length of the different loti, and more\r\nespecially of the L. Arbor, with which they must have been familiarly\r\nacquainted. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 298, 513); Serapion (c. 120); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 487); Ebn Baithar (ii, 539.) They all recommend it as a\r\npowerful astringent in looseness of the bowels, bloody flux, menorrhagia,\r\nulcers of the bowels, and in asthma and affections of the chest. One of\r\nSerapion’s authorities calls it stomachic and a whetter of the appetite.\r\nThe lotus occurs in the Hippocratic treatises; indeed, from the fable of\r\nthe Lotophagi, contained in the Odyssey of Homer, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the lotus had been known and used as an article of food long before\r\nthe time of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜάκερ,\r\n\r\nMacer is a bark brought from India, being desiccative in the third order,\r\nand intermediate as to heating and cooling properties. It consists of\r\nsubtile particles, and is astringent; hence it agrees with cæliac and\r\ndysenteric complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Under this head we cannot do better than quote the words\r\nof an excellent living authority: “_Macer_, a bark from the Barbaric\r\nregion, has been thought to be _Wrightia antidysenterica_, supposing\r\nthis to be the _macre_ described by Crist. d’Acosta. (Clus. Exot. 266.)\r\nThough _macer_ is always described as a bark, I had given me as such the\r\nhighly aromatic leaves of _Rhododendron lepidotum_ under the name of\r\n_talisfur_. _Mafur_ and _mafurbooz_ are in Persian works assigned as the\r\nGreek names of _talisafar_, under which name the _macer_ of Dioscorides\r\nis alluded to by Avicenna.” (Antiq. of Hindoo Med. 91, by Dr. Royle).\r\nThough the _macer_ of the Greeks, then, was different from mace, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the Arabians confounded the two substances together.\r\nThus Avicenna, in his chapter on mace, quotes the words of Paulus on\r\nthe macer. (ii, 2, 448.) Serapion in like manner, under mace, which he\r\ncorrectly describes as the rind or membrane of the nutmeg, gives the\r\ncharacters of macer from Dioscorides. (De Simpl. 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜαλάβαθρον,\r\n\r\nMalabathrum; the leaf of it has powers like the spikenard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dr. Ainslie, treating of the Cassia Lignea, or Cassia bark,\r\nsays, “the narrow-pointed leaves of the _Laurus Cassia_, as well as the\r\noblong, ovate, shining leaves of the Cinnamon-tree, are sold in the\r\nIndian bazaars under the names of _lawangapatery_ and _tejpat_, from\r\na notion that they are the leaves of the _Laurus Cassia_. In commerce\r\nthese leaves are called _Folia Indica_, or _Malabathra_, a name which\r\nmore especially applies to the leaves of the Laurus Cassia.” (Med. Ind.\r\n§ 35.) Geoffroy, Sprengel, and Royle also agree in holding the Cassia,\r\nor Cinnamon-leaf, to be the _Folium Indicum_. Dr. Sontheimer, then, in\r\nhis translation of Ibn Baithar, makes it to be a peculiar species of\r\n_Laurus_, calling it _Laurus Malabathrum_, and Dr. Pereira does the\r\nsame. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, the query is put whether the\r\nCassia-buds be the product of _Laurus Cassia_, or _L. Malabathrum_.\r\nIsidorus says of it, “_Folium_ dictum quod sine ulla radice innatans\r\nin Indiæ littoribus colligitur.” (Orig. xviii, 9.) It is always simply\r\ncalled _Folium_ by Apicius. Horace applies the word to an ointment.\r\n“Malabathro Syrio capillos,” (Od. ii, 7); on which passage his\r\ncommentator, Porphyrion, remarks, “Malabathrum unguenti speciem esse\r\nscimus.” This is the Unguentum Malabathrinum of Dioscorides. (i, 76.)\r\nThe ancients, as Dr. Hill remarks, have said much of the virtues of\r\nMalabathrum. They call it stomachic, sudorific, and cephalic. Dioscorides\r\nascribes to it all the virtues of the Indian spikenard; but he says it\r\npossesses them in a superior degree. He also mentions it as a scent. (i,\r\n11.) Galen and the other Greek authorities, like our author, dismiss\r\nit with a brief notice, comparing it to spikenard. The Arabians treat\r\nof it at greater length, but do little more, after all, than copy the\r\ncharacters of it given by Dioscorides. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 253);\r\nSerapion (c. 53.) It occurs only once in the works of Celsus (v, 23), as\r\nan ingredient, in one of his antidotes; and does not occur at all, we\r\nbelieve, in the Hippocratic Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜαλάχη,\r\n\r\nMalva, _Mallows_; the wild is moderately discutient and emollient; but\r\nthe garden, as being more moistening, is also weaker. Its fruit, however,\r\nis as much stronger as it is drier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems no reason to doubt that it applies to _Malva\r\nsylvestris_, but probably comprehended other species. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes minutely the cases to which it is applicable, namely, as a\r\ncataplasm in incipient fistula lachrymalis, with oil for achores and\r\nfurfures, and also so prepared for burns and erysipelas; its decoction as\r\na hip-bath in diseases of the uterus; and as a suitable enema in pains of\r\nthe bowels, womb, and anus; its broth he praises in cases of poisoning,\r\nas producing evacuation of the stomach, and says it is beneficial to\r\npersons stung by phalangia, and attracts milk to the breasts; its fruit,\r\nwhen the reed of the wild lotus is mixed with it, allays pains about the\r\nbladder. (ii, 144.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat of it as\r\na medicine in more general terms, representing it to be gently discutient\r\nand demulcent. It occurs in the works of Hippocrates and Celsus; the\r\nlatter praises it as a pot-herb, and recommends it as a gentle laxative.\r\n(vii, 27.) The Arabians treat of it fully; but have little to add to\r\nthe excellent description of its medicinal powers given by Dioscorides,\r\nwhom they all copy. One of Serapion’s authorities briefly commends\r\nit as a demulcent in affections of the chest and bladder, and as a\r\ncataplasm in hot apostemes. (c. 149.) Avicenna’s account of it is highly\r\ninteresting, but too lengthy for our purpose. He recommends it internally\r\nin complaints of the lungs and liver, and externally as an emollient\r\napplication in a variety of cases. (ii, 2, 194.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜαμιρὰς,\r\n\r\nMamiras, is a sort of radicle of a herb, having, as it were, thick knots,\r\nwhich are believed to attenuate cicatrices and leucomata, being of a\r\ndecidedly detergent power.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article is not mentioned by Dioscorides, Pliny, Galen,\r\nOribasius, nor, we believe, by any of the Arabian writers, with the\r\nexception of Avicenna, who calls it abstergent and cleansing, and\r\nrecommends it for clearing away albugo of the eye, and for cleaning the\r\nnails; he adds of it that it is useful in jaundice and pungent pain of\r\nthe belly. (ii, 2, 479.) It further occurs in one of the antidotes of\r\nNicholas Myrepsus (c. 138), where, his commentator says, the description\r\nof it given by Paulus applies very well to the root known officinally by\r\nthe name of _Doronicum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜανδραγόρας,\r\n\r\nMandragora, _Mandrake_, belongs to the third order of cold medicines. But\r\nits apples have a certain share of heat and humidity, and hence they are\r\npossessed of a soporific power. The bark of the root of it being stronger\r\nis not only cooling, but also desiccant; but the inner part of it is weak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Waiving disputed points regarding the ancient Mandragora,\r\nwe shall merely mention in this place that we believe the _M. Mas_ of\r\nDioscorides to have been _Mandragoras vernalis_, Bertolin, and the M.\r\nFemina _M. autumnalis_. The ancient authors make frequent mention of its\r\nnarcotic and soporific powers. Celsus directs its apples to be placed\r\nbelow the patient’s pillow in cases of obstinate insomnolency. (iii, 18.)\r\nDioscorides, in like manner, says, its apples are narcotic when smelled\r\nto, and also their juice; that if persisted in, they will deprive the\r\nperson of his speech. He mentions mandrake as an ingredient in anodyne\r\ncollyria and pessaries, and says that in an enema it induces sleep.\r\nHe recommends the wine of mandragora to be given to patients before\r\nthey are subjected to the operation of cutting or burning. He gives\r\nminute directions for making the various preparations of mandragora. He\r\nconcludes his chapter on it by giving from information an account of\r\nanother species of mandragora, called morion, which he represents as\r\nbeing powerfully narcotic; and hence as being administered by medical men\r\nwhen about to operate by cutting or burning. This plant we agree with\r\nDodonæus and Cordus in thinking must have been the M. of Theophrastus,\r\nnamely, the _Atropa Belladonna_. Considering the diligence of the ancient\r\nherbalists, it is not likely that they should have wholly overlooked so\r\nprominent and important an article as the _Belladonna_. The objections\r\nstated to this opinion by Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 344) do not\r\nappear to us of much force. The account of mandragora given by Pliny is\r\nmostly taken from Dioscorides. (H. N. xxv, 94.) Our author and Aëtius\r\nborrow almost word for word from Galen. Isidorus says of it, “Cujus\r\ncortex vino mixtus ad bibendum iis datur quorum corpus propter curam\r\nsecandum est, ut soporati dolorem non sentiant.” Serapion in like manner\r\ndescribes it as a powerful narcotic, and says that it was administered\r\nbefore the performance of amputation to diminish sensibility. (c. 333.)\r\nAvicenna particularly commends the narcotic and soporific powers of\r\nthis medicine. He says that it exerts its action in a suppository. The\r\nmilky juice of it, he adds, evacuates phlegm and yellow bile. He states\r\nthat if a young person, by mistake, partake of its berries, they bring\r\non vomiting, purging, and perhaps death. The seed mixed with sulphur\r\nvivum, is said by him to stop menorrhagia. Like Dioscorides, he says,\r\nthat mandrake evacuates the stomach and bowels like hellebore. (ii, 2,\r\n357.) Averrhoes briefly says of its apples, that they are soporific, and\r\nthat its bark is desiccative, but its root weaker. (v. 42.) See also\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 446.) Servitor describes both a concrete and an\r\nexpressed juice of mandragora. The former, which he calls lachryma, he\r\nsays could not be procured everywhere. Even the non-professional writers\r\nallude to its soporific powers. Thus Lucian speaks of ὕπο μαδραγόρας\r\nκαθεύδειν. (Timon.) Pollux says that it produces heaviness of the head,\r\nthat is to say, stupor. Our old herbalists, Turner, Gerard, Parkinson,\r\nand Culpeper, mention the soporific powers of the mandrake, but in such\r\na way as implies that they had not much practical acquaintance with\r\nit. By the days of Boerhaave and Quincy, its internal use had been\r\nabandoned, both in this country and on the continent. Although it has\r\nnow disappeared from our Dispensatories, we see no good reason why its\r\nwell-regulated use might not be revived. That the ancients have described\r\nits operation on the animal economy correctly, is admitted by our latest\r\nwriters on Toxicology and the Materia Medica. See the works of Orfila,\r\nChristison, and Pereira. In conclusion it may be proper to state, that\r\nthe modern Arabians and Persians still use the mandragora as a narcotic\r\nand antispasmodic. See Ainslie (Mat. Ind. i, 1, 116.) It is not contained\r\nin the Greek Pharmacopœia of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜάννα λιβάνου,\r\n\r\nManna Thuris, has similar powers to frankincense, but enfeebled and\r\ngently astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Gesner says of it, “Manna thuris est fragmina minora corticis\r\nramentis permista.” (Lexicon Rusticum.) Dr. Hill calls it the fragments\r\nof the cluster frankincense broke off in the carriage. It is singular\r\nthat the Greek and Roman writers make no mention of the manna now in\r\nuse, namely, the concrete juice of the _Fraxinus Ornus_. Actuarius had,\r\nno doubt, learned the use of it from the Arabians. (Meth. M. v, 8.)\r\nWe will treat of the true manna more properly in the Appendix to this\r\nsection, among the medicinal substances introduced by the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜάραθρον,\r\n\r\nFœniculum, _Fennel_, is heating in the third degree, but desiccative in\r\nthe first; it therefore forms milk and relieves suffusions of the eye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives a fuller exposition of the medicinal\r\nproperties of this substance (_Anethum Fœniculum_) than any of the other\r\nauthorities on the Mat. Med., representing it as being possessed of\r\npowers to promote the secretion of milk; as being useful in complaints\r\nof the kidneys and bladder as a diuretic, and in those of the uterus as\r\nan emmenagogue; as being alexipharmic, and as a suitable application to\r\nthe bites of mad dogs; and an excellent ingredient in collyria, and more\r\nespecially the gum of it, which is produced on the plant in Spain. (iii,\r\n74.) Galen, in the main, gives it the same characters, holding it to be\r\ndiuretic, emmenagogue, and a suitable ingredient in collyria. Aëtius\r\nand our author follow Galen. It occurs frequently in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises. (551, &c. ed. Foës.) Celsus ranks it among his diuretics (ii,\r\n31), and among the articles which at the same time repress and mollify\r\n(ii, 33.) The Arabians treat fully of the fennel in nearly the same terms\r\nas the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 274); Serapion (c. 324); Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 293.) They all represent it as\r\nbeing diuretic, emmenagogue, alexipharmic, and an excellent application\r\nin diseases of the eyes. They quote Democritus (?) as stating that vipers\r\nand other venomous creatures rub their eyes upon fennel to improve their\r\nsight. This species of fennel, namely, the _Fœniculum vulgare_, is not\r\nnow employed as a medicine in this country. The other species, _Fœniculum\r\ndulce_, or Sweet Fennel, although Matthiolus takes it for the ancient\r\n_Marathron_, would seem to have been unknown to the ancients. The former\r\nspecies, however, held a place in our Dispensatory down to a recent\r\nperiod. See Quincy (77.) It still holds a place in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia (68.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜαστίχη,\r\n\r\nMastiche, _Mastich_; the Chian is heating and dessicant in the second\r\ndegree; but it is possessed of complicated powers, being at the same\r\ntime astringent and emollient; hence it agrees with inflammations of\r\nthe œsophagus and stomach, and those of the intestines and liver; but\r\nthe Egyptian, being darker, is more desiccant and discutient, and less\r\nastringent; wherefore it discusses furunculi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Mastich is correctly described as the resin of the lentiscus\r\nby Dioscorides (i, 90), and Pliny (H. N. xxiv, 28.) Both mention that\r\nit is used in the formation of agglutinative plasters for the cure of\r\ntrichiasis. Serapion joins the Greek authorities in recommending it for\r\nhæmoptysis. Its use in medicine is as old as the time of Hippocrates. The\r\n“resina ex lentisco” is an ingredient in one of the discutient plasters\r\nrecommended by Celsus for the cure of phymata. (v, 18, 22.) Honain, one\r\nof Serapion’s authorities, recommends it in inflammations of the stomach,\r\nand in cough. Another of them says of it, that when mixed with aloes it\r\nforms a good masticatory. (c. 183.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜέλαν,\r\n\r\nAtramentum; the Indian, as Dioscorides says, is of the class of slightly\r\nrefrigerating medicines, and of those which occasion the rupture of\r\nphlegmons and swellings, and cleanse ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes two distinct substances by the name\r\nof Ἰνδικόν. The one is the vegetable pigment, still called Indigo; the\r\nother was probably a red mineral of copper, some variety, we suppose,\r\nof the mineral called “tetrahedral red copper ore” by Jameson, or “red\r\noxide of copper” of Philips. Dioscorides recommends it in much the same\r\ncases as our author. (v, 107.) The other Greek authorities scarcely treat\r\nof it. Our author seems evidently to refer to Indian ink. The Arabians\r\nconfound together the dye-producing plants, and accordingly treat of\r\nthe woad (Isatis tinctoria) along with the plant which produces indigo.\r\nSee Serapion (c. 47), and under _Isatis_ in this section. Averrhoes’s\r\ndescription is very indistinct, so that it is difficult to know what to\r\nmake of his _Indicum_. (Collig. v, 42.) Avicenna in one place alludes to\r\nthe mineral pinguent of our author, which he calls Tinctura Inda. (ii, 2,\r\n689.) We beg to refer our readers to Beckmann’s ‘History of Inventions’\r\nfor much curious information under the head of _Indigo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελαντηρία,\r\n\r\nAtramentum metallicum, is powerfully astringent with subtilty of parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives a pretty circumstantial description of\r\nthree or four varieties of it, and yet none of them can be recognized\r\nwith any degree of certainty. One thing only is certain, that they must\r\nall have contained more or less of copper, being found in mines of\r\ncopper. As far as we can judge, the mineral named “ferruginous arseniate\r\nof copper” by Cleaveland, is the most likely to be the melanteria of\r\nDioscorides. He says it has the same caustic powers as misy. (v, 117.)\r\nGalen calls it only powerfully astringent and of subtile parts; and hence\r\nSprengel inclines to set down his melanteria as being different from that\r\nof Dioscorides; but between the action of a strong astringent and a weak\r\ncaustic, the distinction is not great. In describing the melanteria,\r\nAëtius follows Galen, and Oribasius Dioscorides. There is no mention of\r\nit in the works of Hippocrates, Celsus, and Pliny. The Arabians confuse\r\ntheir description of it by mixing together those of misy, chalcitis, and\r\nsori along with it, under the head of _Atramentum sutorium_. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 47.) Serapion also fails to give any distinct account of it. (De\r\nMiner.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜέλαν ᾧ γράφομεν,\r\n\r\nAtramentum scriptorium, _Writing Ink_; this, too, is decidedly desiccant;\r\nbut when dissolved in oxycrate and rubbed in, it straightway relieves\r\nburns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Writing Ink._ Dioscorides describes the composition of\r\ntwo different kinds of ink; the former consisting of the soot of pines\r\nwith gum, and the other containing the soot of rosin, bull’s glue, and\r\ncopperas. For a fuller account of the inks used by the ancients, see\r\nPliny (H. N. xxxv, 6), Oribasius (Med. Collect, xiii), Isidorus (Orig.\r\nxix), and Montfauçon (Palæog. Græca, c. i.) Dioscorides says of it that\r\nit is adapted to the healing of putrid ulcers and burns, when rubbed in\r\nthick with water and allowed to remain, until cicatrization takes place;\r\nfor, he adds, when the application falls off the ulcers are healed. (v,\r\n182.) Celsus alludes to the same principle of treating aphthous sores in\r\nthe throat, but directs the crusts to be formed with alum, chalcitis, or\r\nthe Atramentum sutorium. The Atramentum scriptorium he only notices once,\r\nin describing the operation of trephining the skull. (viii, 4.) Avicenna\r\nalludes also to the practice of Dioscorides. (ii, 2, 689.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελάνθιον,\r\n\r\nNigella sativa, _Gith_, is calefacient and desiccant in the third degree.\r\nIt is also distinguished for tenuity of parts; and hence when smelled\r\nto it cures catarrhs, and is most carminative when taken internally. It\r\nis also bitter, and hence it is anthelminthic. It is also detergent and\r\nincisive, and hence it agrees with orthopnœa, cleanses leprosies, ejects\r\nmyrmecia, and promotes menstruation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Nigella sativa_, or Gith. Dioscorides, with great\r\nprecision, and in his usual empirical style, enumerates all the cases\r\nin which this substance is applicable. As these in the main are the\r\nsame as those in which our author recommends it, we need not enter much\r\ninto an exposition of the views of Dioscorides on this head. He says\r\nit promotes the secretion of urine, menses, and milk; removes dyspnœa\r\nwhen drunk with wine; remedies persons stung by venomous spiders; drives\r\naway reptiles, in the form of a fumigation; and that it is reported to\r\nprove fatal when drunk in large quantity. (iii, 83.) Galen explains\r\nits medicinal virtues most scientifically, upon the principles laid\r\ndown by him in his preliminary dissertation to the Materia Medica, of\r\nwhich we have given an exposition in an extract from Aëtius. Gith, he\r\nsays, is heating and drying according to the third order, and seems to\r\nbe attenuant, _or_ of subtile parts; wherefore it cures catarrhs when\r\napplied hot in a linen cloth, so as to be constantly smelled to. And it\r\nis most carminative, when taken into the body, as is obvious from its\r\nbeing of subtile parts, and of a substance fine-wrought by the heat,\r\nwherefore, also, it is bitter; for it was shown in the Fourth Book of\r\nthese Commentaries, that when a terrene substance arrives at an extreme\r\ntenuity and elaboration, the bitter quality is formed. No wonder,\r\nthen, if it proves vermifuge, not only when eaten, but when applied\r\nexternally to the belly; for it was formerly shown that a bitter juice\r\ndoes this. Nor that it removes leprosy, clavus, and myrmecia, need it\r\nseem wonderful to one who remembers what was formerly said. And thus it\r\nrelieves orthopnœa, and promotes menstruation, when it is restrained\r\nby the thickness and viscidity of the humours; and, in a word, when we\r\nwish to incide, cleanse, dry, and heat, it is a most useful medicine.\r\n(De Simpl. viii.) Having given so full an exposition of Galen’s views,\r\nwe must be brief on those of the other authorities. The gith occurs in\r\nthe Mat. Med. of Hippocrates, but is not to be met with in the works of\r\nCelsus. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 516); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 496); Serapion (c. 328.) They all follow closely in the footsteps\r\nof Dioscorides and Galen. Though the gith has ceased for some time past\r\nto be used in medicine, it is still sometimes sought after as a spice.\r\nSee Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 123.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜέλι,\r\n\r\nMel, _Honey_, is heating and desiccant in the second order, and is also\r\nconsiderably detergent. When boiled it becomes less acrid, detergent and\r\ncathartic, but more nutritious. But bitter honey, like that in Sardonia,\r\nis of mixed powers, being terrene and hot. The _Sacchar_ (Sugar) which is\r\nbrought from Araby the Blessed is less sweet than that with us, but is\r\npossessed of equal powers, with the additional advantage of not injuring\r\nthe stomach and occasioning thirst like it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On the use of honey, see Book I, s. 69. “The honey of reeds”\r\nis mentioned in a fragment of Theophrastus. (ed. Heinsius.) It is\r\ndistinctly noticed by Dioscorides (i, 104), Strabo (Geogr. xv), Pliny\r\n(H. N. xii, 17), Galen (Med. Simpl. vii), Oribasius (Med. Collect. xi),\r\nIsidorus (Orig. xvii, 7), Alexander Aphrodisiensis (Probl.), and Symeon\r\nSeth (in voce Sacchar.) It is alluded to by Statius in the following line:\r\n\r\n    “Et quas præcoquit Æbusita cannas.”—_Silv._ i, 6, 15.\r\n\r\nLucan also mentions it. (Pharsal. iii, 237.) All the Arabian medical\r\nauthors, in a word, make frequent mention of it. It is obvious, however,\r\nas is remarked by Harduin, Salmasius, Freind, Millward, and Sprengel,\r\nthat the ancient sugar was a concretion formed upon the surface of\r\nreeds by the heat of the sun, and consequently it was different from\r\nthe sugar of the moderns, which is formed by boiling. Symeon Seth says\r\nof sugar that it is heating and humid in the first degree, detergent,\r\nand diaphoretic like honey. Mesue recommends it for the composition of\r\nelectuaries. Dr. Hill states that although the _Bambu_ be the sugar-cane\r\nwith which the ancients were most familiar, it would appear that the\r\n“tenera arundo” of Lucan was rather the common sugar-reed of our times.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελία,\r\n\r\nFraxinus, _the Ash_, is a well-known tree, the leaves of which, when\r\ntaken in a draught, agree with the bites of vipers. Its bark, when burnt\r\nand rubbed in with water, removes leprosies. The sawdust of the wood when\r\ndrunk is said to be deadly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt of its being a species of _Fraxinus_,\r\nor perhaps both the _F. Ornus_ and _F. rotundifolia_. Our author’s\r\naccount of it is taken literally from Dioscorides. (i, 108.) Avicenna\r\nmentions it as a vulnerary herb, and recommends it in the same cases as\r\nDioscorides does. (i, 108.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελίλωτον,\r\n\r\nMelilotum, _Melilot_, is possessed of mixed powers, being astringent,\r\ndiscutient, and digestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Melilotus officinalis_, L. Dioscorides says of\r\nit, that it has some styptic power, and is an emollient of all kinds of\r\ninflammations, especially about the eyes, womb, anus, and testicles, when\r\nboiled with must and applied, or along with albumen of an egg, flour of\r\nfenugreek, &c.; that it cures meliceris when recent, achores, and pain\r\nof the stomach, and earache when injected into the ear, and headache\r\nwhen used as an embrocation with vinegar and oil of roses. (iii, 41.)\r\nGalen and the other Greek authorities state its application in general\r\nterms like our author. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 445);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 465); Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 18.) They scarcely suggest any new cases for its administration,\r\nbut borrow what they say of its medicinal powers from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. The melilot was used in medicine, and held a place in our English\r\nDispensatory even as late as the time of Quincy. (118, 204.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜελισσόφυλλον,\r\n\r\nApiastrum, _Baum_; its action is in every respect like that of horehound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Dioscorides, Baum (_Melissa officinalis_),\r\nwhen its leaves are taken in a draught with wine, or when applied as a\r\ncataplasm, is alexipharmic in the case of persons stung by scorpions\r\nor venomous spiders, and of those who have been bitten by mad dogs;\r\nthe decoction in the form of a fomentation (or effusion) does the\r\nsame; it makes a good hip-bath for promoting menstruation; is a gargle\r\nfor toothache and a clyster for dysentery; its leaves, in a draught,\r\ncure those who have taken poisonous mushrooms, and those suffering\r\nfrom tormina; it forms a linctus in orthopnœa, and along with salts a\r\ndiscutient application to scrofula and ulcers; and as a cataplasm it\r\nsoothes pains of the joints. (iii, 108.) Our author borrows from Galen,\r\nwho, like him, gives its characters in general terms. Aëtius, under this\r\nhead, copies from Galen, and Oribasius from Dioscorides. We believe it is\r\nnot to be found either in the works of Hippocrates, or those of Celsus.\r\nSerapion gives a full account of it, first quoting from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen, and then from Abenmesuai and Isaak ebn Amran; the former of whom\r\nsays it is exhilarating, and the other that it is useful in a cold and\r\nhumid intemperament of the stomach, promotes digestion, proves cordial,\r\n&c. (c. 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜεμάικυλος,\r\n\r\nMemæcylus, being the _Fruit of the Arbute_, has been treated of under the\r\nletter Κ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is, as here stated, the fruit of the wild\r\n_Strawberry-tree_, that is to say of the _Arbutus Unedo_, L.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜέσπιλα,\r\n\r\nMespila, _Medlars_ (called also Tricocca); their fruit being decidedly\r\nsour and scarcely edible, proves astringent of the bowels: and its shoots\r\nand leaves are also decidedly sour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes the two species of Medlar in such\r\ndistinct terms as leaves no doubt that they are the _Mespilus Azarolus_\r\nand _Germanica_. He represents their fruit as being esculent and slightly\r\nastringent. (i, 169, 170.) Galen says of the medlar, that it is acid and\r\naustere, and barely esculent, and that it restrains fluxes. (De Simpl.\r\nvii.) The other Greek and Arabian authorities give the same account of\r\nit. See in particular, Avicenna (ii, 2, 742) and Ebn Baithar (i, 532.)\r\nThe Arabians prepared an ointment from it for making the hair black and\r\ncurled. Casiri (Bibl. Arab. Hisp. 330.) The term _azarolus_ is borrowed\r\nfrom the Arabic. See Avicenna (l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜήδιον,\r\n\r\nMedium; the powers of the root are contrary to those of the fruit, for\r\nthe former is austere and astringent of fluxes, so as to restrain the\r\nfemale fluor. But the seed even promotes menstruation, being possessed of\r\nattenuating and incisive powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The description of this article given by Dioscorides is\r\nsufficiently precise to decide its belonging to the genus _Campanula_. It\r\nwas at one time generally referred to the species called _Medium_, but,\r\nas Sprengel remarks, the appearance of the leaves does not agree with\r\nthose of the _medium_. Sibthorp, therefore, in his ‘Flora Græca,’ has\r\ndecided that it is the _C. laciniata_. (i, 141.) Dioscorides and Galen\r\nagree in giving it the same medicinal powers as our author. We are at\r\na loss to determine whether or not it occurs in the Materia Medica of\r\nthe Arabians, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely gives the\r\ndescriptions of it by Dioscorides and Galen. (ii, 541.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜήκωνες,\r\n\r\nPapavera, _Poppies_; there are several species, but of the garden poppy,\r\nwhich they call _Thylacitis_, the seed is edible, and when eaten with\r\nbread is moderately soporific. That species which is called _Rhæas_,\r\nbecause its seed soon falls off, is stronger than the garden. It is\r\ntherefore not eaten by itself, but a small quantity of it is mixed with\r\nmuch honey. That which has a sessile head has seeds which are black and\r\nstrongly medicinal, being considerably cold. That the top of which is\r\nlonger and more contracted, is the most strongly medicinal of all, so\r\nas to induce torpor even to mortification. For it and its juice, which\r\nis called, _per excellentiam_, opium, belong to the fourth order of\r\ncongealing medicines. But that variety which is called _Cornutum_ is\r\npossessed of detergent powers, so that the decoction of it when drunk is\r\nserviceable in hepatic complaints. Its leaves and flowers cleanse foul\r\nulcers and remove eschars. That species which is called _Heraclium_ and\r\n_Spumosum_, has seeds which purge phlegm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In the Fifth Book we have treated fully of the different\r\nspecies of poppy known to the ancients. See also Schulze (Toxicol. Vet.)\r\nThe _Rhæas_ would seem to be the _Papaver dubium_, the _sativum_ is the\r\n_P. Rhæas_. The Papaver cornutum appears to be the _Glaucium luteum_,\r\nScop. The _P. spumeum_ may be the _Gratiola officinalis_, Angl. Hedge\r\nHyssop. The ancients distinguished two kinds of the inspissated juice of\r\nthe poppy: the one was the juice obtained by wounding the poppy-heads,\r\nand was called μήκωνος ὄπος, and ὄπιον; the other was an expressed juice,\r\nmuch weaker than this, called μηκώνιον. The second sort is not known at\r\npresent. We will treat more fully of opium under that head, and therefore\r\nwe shall dismiss the present subject with a briefer notice than we should\r\notherwise have thought it necessary to bestow upon it. The views of the\r\nArabians regarding the different kinds of poppy may be best learned from\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 563.) He copies, however, almost all his information\r\nfrom Dioscorides. He recommends the application of the Papaver cornutum\r\nin diseases of the eye, with certain cautions, explained under opium. He\r\nfollows Dioscorides in strongly commending the leaves of the same as an\r\napplication to foul ulcers, when he says they have the effect of removing\r\nall the eschars upon the sores. Dioscorides, by the way, mentions that\r\nthe veterinarians used the horned poppy for removing the albugo and\r\nnebulæ on the eyes of cattle. He speaks favorably of the effects of the\r\npoppy in general for the cure of hot catarrhs, defluxions on the breast,\r\nand hæmoptysis. See further Serapion (c. 72); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n533); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) The last of these joins Avicenna in\r\napproving of the poppy for affections of the chest. Ebn Baithar, in\r\ndifferent parts of his great work, treats of the several species of poppy\r\nnoticed under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜῆλα,\r\n\r\nMala, _Apples_; a common property of all apples is that of an\r\nexcrementitious and cold juice, but those which are dissolved and watery\r\nare colder and more humid than the others. The sweet are watery, but not\r\nsensibly cold. Those which are austere are colder than the sweet, but\r\nless humid. Those which are acid are also cold, and cut the thick humours\r\nin the stomach. The sour, such as _Quinces_, and that species of them\r\ncalled _Struthia_, are of a cold and terrene temperament, and, on that\r\naccount, prove astringent of the belly, and agglutinative of wounds. Thus\r\nthe leaves, juices, and barks of trees differ from one another.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. By _Mala_, as Macrobius states, the ancients understood all\r\nkinds of fruit which have their hard part or kernel in the middle, and\r\ntheir esculent part without. (Saturnalia, iii, 19.) The malum cydonium\r\nis undoubtedly the _Quince_. The _Struthia_ is a species of it. See\r\nDioscorides (i, 160); Pliny (H. N. xv, 10); Casiri (Bibl. Arab. Hisp.\r\ni, 329.) These, namely, the _Struthia_, according to Harduin, are the\r\nsame as our _Pear-quince_; it is an astringent, stomachic fruit. There\r\nis more difficulty in determining for certain what the Malum Persicum\r\nwas. Stackhouse makes it to be the _Citrus aurantium_, or _Orange_, but\r\nwe are disposed to think that the evidence preponderates in favour of\r\nthe opinion of Matthiolus, R. Stephens, and Harduin, who held that it\r\nis the _Peach_ (_Amygdalus Persica_.) That species, or rather variety,\r\nwhich Pliny calls _Duracina_, was probably the _Nectarine_, as Harduin\r\nsuggests. The Malum Armeniacum, or præcocia, was undoubtedly the\r\n_Apricot_. See Harduin in Plin. H. N. (xv, 31); Casiri (Bibl. Arab.\r\nHisp. i, 330); and Gesner (Lex. Rust.) Contrary to the opinion of the\r\netymologists, we have long thought that the English name is a corruption\r\nof the Latin _præcocia_. See, however, Loudon (Encyc. of Garden. 806.)\r\nWe have given their characters as articles of food in the First Book. As\r\nto their medicinal powers, little need be added to our author’s account\r\nof them, as it agrees entirely with that of the other authorities.\r\nSee in particular, Dioscorides (i, 160, 166); Galen (De Simpl. vii);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 562.) Galen makes mention of the quince and pear-quince\r\nas being preserved with honey. He recommends the leaves, the juice,\r\nand the rind of apple trees in general, as being possessed of acid\r\nand austere qualities, and thus agglutinating wounds, restraining the\r\ndefluxions of incipient inflammations, and strengthening the stomach and\r\nbowels when they have lost their tone. Dioscorides and, afterwards more\r\nfully, Avicenna state that the immoderate use of fruit is flatulent, and\r\nsuperinduces nervous debility. Dioscorides describes accurately the mode\r\nof preparing a wine from quinces, which, he says, is possessed of the\r\nsame medicinal powers as the parts of the quince. He also makes mention\r\nof an ointment prepared from it. Avicenna represents all the fragrant\r\nkinds of apples as being cordial and alexipharmic, and strengtheners of\r\nthe stomach. One of Rhases’s authorities gives an interesting account of\r\nthe medicinal powers of apples as cordials, stomachics, and astringents.\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 441.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜηλάια Περσικὴ,\r\n\r\nMalum Persicum, _the Peach_; the shoots and leaves are manifestly bitter,\r\nand therefore kill worms when triturated and applied to the navel. The\r\nfruit of it, which forms the edible peach, is humid, and cold in the\r\nsecond degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See under Μῆλα.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜηλάια Ἀρμενιακὴ,\r\n\r\nMalus Armeniaca, _Apricot_; the fruit, which some call Præcocia, is\r\npossessed of the same powers as peaches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See under Μῆλα.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜῆον,\r\n\r\nMeum, _Spignel_; its roots are hot in the third degree, but dry in the\r\nsecond. It is therefore diuretic and emmenagogue, but occasions headache\r\nwhen taken often.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Meum Athamanticum_, which is\r\nthe same as the _Ligusticum Meum_ of Hooker, Angl., Spignel, Meu, or\r\nBald-money. Our author and most of the other authorities copy closely\r\nfrom Dioscorides, who describes the roots of the meum as being fragrant,\r\nand heating the tongue. These, he says, being boiled in water or given in\r\npowder without boiling, prove soothing in diseases of constriction about\r\nthe kidneys and bladder, relieve dysuria, flatulence of the stomach,\r\ntormina, hysterical affections, and pains of the joints. When pulverized\r\nand administered with honey, they are useful in pectoral defluxions as a\r\nlinctus, and in a hip-bath promote the flow of the menses. When applied\r\nas a cataplasm to the region of the pubes in infants, they are said by\r\nhim to produce the discharge of the urine. But when taken immoderately,\r\nthe meum occasions headache. (i, 3.) In the above extract, by “diseases\r\nof constriction” Dioscorides alludes to a well-known dogma of the\r\nMethodists. It would appear, then, that he was imbued with the principles\r\nof that sect. None of the other Greek authorities treat of it so fully as\r\nDioscorides. As far as we have discovered, it does not occur in the works\r\nof Hippocrates, nor in those of Celsus. For the Arabians, see Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 454); Serapion (De Simpl. 182); Rhases (Collig. l. ult. i, 477);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) They do nothing but copy from Dioscorides.\r\nIn the works of all our old herbalists and authorities on the English\r\nDispensatory, down to the days of Quincy and Lewis, the meum retains a\r\nplace with all its ancient characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜῖλαξ,\r\n\r\nMilax or Smilax, _Bindweed_; both the smooth, and the rough species which\r\ntwines round trees, are possessed of acrid and heating powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The two species here noticed are most probably the _Smilax\r\naspera_ and _Convolvulus sepium_. Dioscorides commends the former\r\nof these principally as being alexipharmic, and the latter as being\r\nsoporific. (iv, 142, 143.) Galen and the other Greek authorities, like\r\nour author, merely give their general characters. The Arabians would seem\r\nto confound it with the other climbing herbs. See Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n41); Avicenna (ii, 2, 724.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜίσυ,\r\n\r\nMisy, is one of the escharotic and caustic medicines, with a strong\r\nastringency. It is less pungent than chalcitis, owing to the greater\r\ntenuity of its parts. And Galen says that chalcitis and sori, in the\r\ncourse of time, change to misy, the change beginning at the surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears strange that this mineral should now be so little\r\nknown, seeing it was well known as late as the days of Boerhaave, and\r\nis still used medicinally in the East. Boerhaave says of it, “Misy, a\r\nyellow mineral very much resembling the marcasite or mundick of our\r\nmines, but lighter, and of a less compact nature.... It is a vitriolic\r\nmineral, and is reduced by calcination to a colcothar.” (M. M. 184.) Dr.\r\nAinslie, treating of the preparations of copper employed in medicine by\r\nthe natives of India, says, “Misy is the name of an oxide of copper used\r\nby the natives of India against the toothache, and to stain their teeth\r\nblack.” (Mat. Ind. i, 513.) Dr. Royle, treating of the _misy_ and _sory_\r\nof Dioscorides, states that they had been supposed by Rossius to be\r\nsulphurets of copper, “but it is remarkable that _mis_ is a Persian name\r\nfor copper, and that _missy_ is a name frequently applied in India to\r\nsulphate of iron.” (Antiq. of Hindoo Med. 102.) From these descriptions\r\nof it we find some difficulty in deciding what mineral substance it was;\r\nbut see under _Chalcitis_. The following is Dioscorides’s description of\r\nthe misy: “Of a golden appearance, hard, shining like gold when broken,\r\nand glancing like stars.” (v, 116.) He says it has the same powers as\r\n_chalcitis_. Galen gives an elaborate description of _misy_ and its\r\ncognate fossils _sory_ and _chalcitis_, but says little more than our\r\nauthor respecting its medicinal powers. (De Simpl. viii.) The other Greek\r\nauthorities supply nothing additional of any great interest under this\r\nhead. Serapion describes the three substances we have mentioned under the\r\ngeneral head “de vitreola,” calling the sory _Zeg rubeum_, the chalcitis\r\n_colcothar_, and the misy _Zeg viride_. His account of them is taken\r\nentirely from Dioscorides and Galen. (c. 386.) Avicenna confounds them\r\nand other metallic preparations under the name of “Atramentum sutorium.”\r\nHe throws no light on the subject. (ii, 2, 47.) See Rhases (Cont l. ult.\r\n747.) Averrhoes, under the head of _Alceg_, i. e. Vitriolum, gives a\r\ntranslation of Galen’s description already noticed. (Collig. v, 43.) Misy\r\noccurs in the works both of Hippocrates and Celsus. The latter uses it as\r\na caustic. (v, 8, 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜολύβδαινα,\r\n\r\nPlumbago, has similar powers to litharge, but removed from the middle\r\ntemperament to the colder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Several varieties of the Molybdæna are described by\r\nDioscorides, from which it would appear that the ancients applied the\r\nterm to more than one metallic substance; the variety resembling litharge\r\nbeing most probably graphite or plumbago; and the one of a leaden\r\ncolour, being the molybdate of lead, or “yellow lead-spar” of Jameson.\r\nIt is named Galena by his translators, but whether it, that is to say,\r\nthe sulphuret of lead, was also comprehended under it we are unable to\r\ndetermine. The molybdæna occurs in the works of Hippocrates. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as being incarnative and epulotic in plasters. Galen and\r\nthe other Greek authorities treat of its medicinal powers succinctly\r\nlike our author. None of the Arabians appear to have distinguished the\r\nmolybdæna properly from litharge.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜόλυβδος,\r\n\r\nPlumbum, _Lead_, is possessed of refrigerant powers, and has also a\r\nconsiderably humid substance congealed by the cold. If wine, the oil\r\nof unripe grapes, or any of the cooling juices be rubbed with it, it\r\nwill make an excellent application for ulcerous inflammations about\r\nthe pudenda and anus. A plate of lead worn upon the loins restrains\r\nlibidinous dreams; and a piece of lead put upon ganglia discusses them.\r\nBurnt lead being more desiccative, is also somewhat acrid. If washed it\r\nbecomes desiccative without pungency, and makes a good application for\r\nill-conditioned ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have already treated of this article as a poison. (Book\r\nV, 62.) The ancients distinguished lead into two kinds, the black and\r\nthe white. Of these the latter is the same as the cassiteros, that is\r\nto say, tin. The other comprehended several of our native ores of lead.\r\nBoth kinds are described in the works of Hippocrates and of Celsus. (v,\r\n26, v, 18, &c.) See also particularly, Pliny (xxxiv, 47) and Isidorus\r\n(Orig. xvi, 21), who have given accurate descriptions of the ancient\r\nvarieties of lead. Dioscorides, Galen, and Serapion agree in describing\r\nit as a powerfully cooling or refrigerant medicine. Galen’s account\r\nof it is lengthy but interesting. (De Simpl. ix.) Oribasius says that\r\nit forms an excellent application to irritable and malignant sores.\r\nDioscorides recommends washed lead very much in rheums of the eye. He\r\ngives a very circumstantial description of the process of preparing\r\nwashed lead. He further says of it, that it is a good styptic, and an\r\nexcellent application to fungated sores, hemorrhoids, condylomata, and\r\nulcers about the anus. Averrhoes treats of it in nearly the same terms as\r\nour author. (Collig. v, 43.) The Arabians, in general, prescribe it, in\r\nimitation of Galen, as an application to cancer. See Averrhoes (l. c.)\r\nand Avicenna (ii, 2, 12.) The latter joins Dioscorides in praising lead\r\nas an application to the eyes. Serapion gives a very full account of this\r\narticle in extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. (De Simpl. 419.) See also\r\nRhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 556); Ebn Baithar (ii, 128, et pluries.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜοράια,\r\n\r\nMorus nigra, _the Mulberry-tree_; the fruit, when ripe, loosens the\r\nbelly, and is useful in all complaints of the mouth which require a\r\nmoderate degree of astringency. The unripe, when dried, becomes a very\r\nstyptic medicine. The bark of the root of the tree is also purgative,\r\nwith a certain degree of bitterness; hence it kills the broad intestinal\r\nworm. The leaves and tender shoots hold an intermediate place between\r\npurgatives and astringents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the _Ficus Morus_, L., or\r\nthe _Black Mulberry-tree_. It is the συκάμινος of Theophrastus, which,\r\nhowever, was sometimes applied by others to the sycamore. See Celsus\r\n(iii, 18.) The mulberry is commended by Pliny as an antidote to poisons,\r\nas it is in like manner by Dioscorides. The latter calls it laxative of\r\nthe bowels, but an article readily spoiled, and bad for the stomach.\r\nHe also ascribes astringent powers to its juice, which, he says, when\r\nmixed with a little honey is useful in defluxious, spreading ulcers, and\r\ninflamed tonsils. He also praises the leaves when pounded with oil, as a\r\ngood cataplasm to burns. He speaks of it also as being used for dyeing\r\nthe hair, and the decoction of its leaves as a gargle for toothache. (i,\r\n180.) Galen’s account of it is the same as our author’s, by whom it is\r\nabridged. Aëtius treats of it fully as an article of food, but briefly\r\nas a medicine. He says, when taken upon a clean stomach, it proves an\r\nexcellent article of food; but the very reverse when the stomach is\r\nloaded and contains any noxious humours. The Arabians, in treating of it,\r\nfollow Dioscorides and Galen. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 491); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 201); Serapion (De Simpl. 132.) The mulberry is described as a\r\nmedicine by all our old herbalists, and was retained in the Dispensatory\r\nuntil after the time of Quincy. (94, 198.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύαγρον,\r\n\r\nMyagrum; the seed of it is fatty, and the oily part of it is possessed of\r\nan emplastic power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is generally held to be the _Camelina sativa_, Crantz., of\r\nwhich we think there can be no doubt. Both Dioscorides and Pliny mention\r\nit as producing an oil from its seed; and it is well known that the\r\nCamelina, or Gold of Paradise, is still noted as one of the oil plants.\r\nSee Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 353.) The two authors mentioned above recommend\r\nthis oil in ulcers of the mouth. Our author borrows from Galen. As far as\r\nwe can discover, it is not treated of by the Arabian authorities, with\r\nthe exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely quotes the description of it\r\ngiven by Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύακες,\r\n\r\nMusculi, _Muscles_, have the same power, when burnt, as the buccina. But\r\nthey have the property, when washed, of removing asperity of the eyebrows\r\nand leucomata when applied with honey. Their flesh is applied with\r\nadvantage to persons bitten by dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Called Μύες by Aristotle and Athenæus, Myaces by Pliny, and\r\nMusculi by Celsus, are the _Mytili edules_, L., or Muscles. Celsus ranks\r\nthem with those things which open the bowels. (ii, 29.) He prescribes the\r\nsoup of muscles as a purgative in fevers. (iii, 6.) Dioscorides merely\r\nrecommends them externally as a stimulant and detergent application in\r\ndiseases of the eyes, and their flesh for the bites of mad dogs. (ii,\r\n7.) The Arabians treat of them in general terms along with the other\r\ncrustacea. See particularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 529.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύαρον,\r\n\r\nMyaron (called also Melampycnon); it is a branchy and fatty herb. The oil\r\nextracted from it would seem to smooth the asperities on the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is clearly the same as the μύαγρον described above. See\r\nJani Cornarii dollabella in P. Æ. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜυελὸς,\r\n\r\nMedulla, _Marrow_; it is possessed of the property of softening indurated\r\nand scirrhous bodies. The best is that of stags, next to it, that of\r\ncalves. That of bulls and of buck-goats is more acrid and desiccative.\r\nThat from the limbs is more fatty and emollient; but that from the spine\r\nis harder and drier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Aristotle, the _Marrow_ is a superfluity\r\nconcocted from the nutritive blood of the bones. He states that the\r\nspinal marrow is considerably different from that of the other bones.\r\n(De Partibus Animalium, ii, 7.) Pliny, copying from Dioscorides, thus\r\ndelivers the general characters of marrows: “Omnes molliunt, explent,\r\nsiccant, calefaciunt.” (H. N. xxviii, 39.) Dioscorides, Galen, and\r\nSerapion concur in giving the preference to the marrow of stags.\r\nDioscorides gives minute directions for preparing it to keep. (ii, 95.)\r\nHe says that smearing the body with stag’s marrow drives away venomous\r\nreptiles. (Ibid.) The Arabians recommend a suppository from marrows as\r\na remedy for scirrhus of the uterus. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 485), Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 460.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύκητες,\r\n\r\nFungi, _Mushrooms_, are of a decidedly cold and humid temperament. Some\r\nof them prove fatal when eaten, more particularly those which have a\r\nputrid quality mixed with their nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have already treated of mushrooms as articles of food (i,\r\n77), and as poisons (v, 54); and shall, therefore, be excused saying\r\nanything more of them in this place. In fact, we cannot see with what\r\npropriety the ancient authorities assigned them a place in the Materia\r\nMedica, since, as far as we can recollect, they never prescribe them\r\nmedicinally.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜυοσώτη,\r\n\r\nIs described under Alsine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύξα,\r\n\r\nMyxa, _the Sebesten-plum_; the fruit of this tree is smaller than the\r\nbullace-plum, but of similar powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear indisputably to be the _Sebesten-plum_,\r\nor fruit of the _Cordia Myxa_. Whether or not this tree be also the\r\n_Persea_ of Dioscorides (i, 187), has been much disputed. See Sprengel\r\n(in Dioscor. l. c.) and Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 628.) We are inclined to\r\ndoubt their identity, and of this there can be no question, if the\r\nauthority of Pliny be held of any weight in this case, for he evidently\r\ndistinguishes between the _persea_ and _myxa_. (H. N. xv, 11, 12.)\r\nNeither Celsus, Galen, Aëtius, nor Oribasius has noticed this article by\r\nname. The sebesten-plum is described by the Arabian authorities without\r\ntheir making any reference to the Greek authorities, as is their wont.\r\nSee Serapion (c. 8); Avicenna (ii, 2, 638); and Rhases (Contin. l. ult.\r\niii, 42.) The barbarous translation of Avicenna begins thus, under\r\nthe head of sebesten: “Sebesten et nominatur mukeita.” For mukeita we\r\nsuppose the proper reading would be _myxa_. The Arabians describe the\r\nsebesten-plum as being a mild laxative fruit, which quenches thirst\r\nand soothes the breast. It is praised by Serapion as a laxative and\r\ncooling remedy in coughs; as a refrigerant medicine for ardor urinæ, and\r\nan anthelminthic. The sebestens continued long to hold a place in our\r\nEnglish Dispensatory, and retained the character which the ancients had\r\ngiven them. See Quincy (130.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜυρίκη,\r\n\r\nMyrica, _the Tamarisk_, is possessed of incisive and detergent powers,\r\nwithout being manifestly desiccative; it has also some astringency.\r\nThe decoction of it, therefore, when drunk, is useful in diseases of\r\nthe spleen; and it likewise cures the toothache. The fruit and bark of\r\nit nearly approach to galls in powers. The ashes of the tree are more\r\ndesiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We may briefly say that we agree with the authorities who\r\nrefer it to the _Tamarix Gallica_, L. Dioscorides, Galen, Averrhoes,\r\nand Serapion, like our author, recommend it as a powerful astringent\r\nwhich may be substituted for galls. Dioscorides accordingly enumerates\r\na variety of cases in which it is applicable, such as in remedies for\r\naffections of the mouth and eyes, spitting of blood, cæliac disease,\r\nfluor albus, jaundice, and the bites of venomous spiders, and to discuss\r\nswellings in the form of a cataplasm. He further recommends its decoction\r\nin wine for reducing the enlarged spleen; as a gargle in toothache;\r\na hip-bath in fluxes, and as a fit lotion for killing lice and nits:\r\nthe lixivial ashes of it, he adds, restrain a discharge from the womb:\r\nsome, he says, form goblets out of the trunk of it, which they use as\r\ndrinking-cups in diseases of the spleen, draughts taken with them being\r\nfound to be serviceable in such cases. (i, 116.) None of the other\r\nauthorities give by any means so satisfactory an account of this subject\r\nas Dioscorides. Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius evidently follow him. Celsus\r\nranks the “tamarix” among his articles which repress and soften. (ii,\r\n33.) It occurs in the works of Hippocrates. (See Dierbach.) For the\r\nArabians, see Serapion (c. 31); Avicenna (ii, 2, 684); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 700); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) Serapion, after quoting the\r\nsections of Dioscorides and Galen on the tamarix, says of it, on the\r\nauthority of Mesarugie, that it dries up all ulcers, especially those\r\nfrom burns. He also relates, on the authority of Alchazi, the case of a\r\nwoman who was cured of a leprosy, by means of it. Avicenna and Rhases say\r\nof it, that its fruit is beneficial in chronic coughs. Avicenna says it\r\ncures the bite of the viper. The curious reader will find it interesting\r\nto compare the medicinal characters of the tamariscus as given in our\r\nEnglish Dispensatory by Quincy, with those given it by the ancients, as\r\nstated above. (134.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜυριόφυλλον,\r\n\r\nMillefolium, _Millefoil_, is desiccative to such a degree as to\r\nagglutinate wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to be the _Myriophyllum spicatum_, Angl., spiked\r\nwater millefoil. At least the description of it given by Dioscorides\r\nevidently points to some species of _myriophyllum_. He recommends it as a\r\ncataplasm with vinegar to recent ulcers; and says of it, that it is drunk\r\nwith water and salts in cases of falls. (iv, 113.) Galen and the other\r\nGreek authorities, like our author, merely mention it as a vulnerary\r\nherb. We have not found it in the works of Hippocrates or Celsus, nor in\r\nthose of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn Baithar. (ii, 500.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜύρρα ἢ Μύρρις,\r\n\r\nMyrrha, _Myrrh_, belongs to the second order of calefacients, and is also\r\ndistinguished for tenuity of parts to a certain degree. The root of it is\r\nfragrant and sweet. It is emmenagogue, and promotes expectoration from\r\nthe chest and lungs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Myrrhis odorata_, as Sprengel remarks, agrees very\r\nwell with Dioscorides’s description of this plant. Dioscorides says of\r\nit, that when drunk with wine it relieves those who have been bitten by\r\nphalangia; that it promotes the menstrual and lochial discharges; taken\r\nin draughts is useful in phthisis; and that some say, that when taken in\r\na pestilential season it preserves persons free from the disease. (iv,\r\n114.) None of the other Greek authorities supply anything of interest\r\nunder this head. We have not been able to find it either in the works of\r\nHippocrates or of Celsus. We are at some loss to account for its being\r\nalso overlooked, as far as we, upon a cursory examination of their works,\r\ncan discover, by the Arabian authorities. Was it that those _illiterate\r\nscholars_ could not distinguish it from _myrrh_ and _myrtle_? Our old\r\nEnglish herbalists, in like manner, seem to have known little about it,\r\nand it has long ceased to hold a place in our Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nΜυρρίνη,\r\n\r\nMyrtus, _the Myrtle_, is composed of opposite ingredients. But the cold\r\nand terrene prevails in it, and hence it is powerfully desiccative. The\r\nmyrtis, which is a callous excrescence on the trunk and branches of\r\nit, is strongly desiccative and astringent. The dried leaves are more\r\ndesiccative than the green. The fruit and juice are possessed of similar\r\npowers, both when administered externally and internally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Myrtus communis_. The _myrtis_ or _myrtas_ of\r\nour author is the same as the _myrtidanum_ of Dioscorides, and most\r\nprobably was some morbid excrescence upon it. Dioscorides calls the\r\nmyrtle astringent, and recommends it in such a variety of cases that it\r\nwould occupy too much space to enumerate them all; such, for example,\r\nas hæmoptysis, erosion of the bladder; as a stomachic and diuretic; an\r\nalexipharmic in the case of persons stung by phalangia or scorpions; as\r\na soothing application in inflammations and extrasavated blood about the\r\neyes; for furfures, achores, exanthemata, and so forth. (i, 155.) The\r\nexcrescence already mentioned possesses, he says, stronger powers than\r\nthe fruit or leaves, and is mixed with cerate, pessaries, hip-baths,\r\nand cataplasms requiring astringency. (i, 156.) Galen gives a somewhat\r\nfuller, but not a materially different, account of the myrtle from\r\nour author. He says it is a powerful astringent, both internally and\r\nexternally. Aëtius abridges him, as Oribasius does Dioscorides. Celsus\r\nnotices the berries and boiled leaves of myrtle frequently as astringent\r\nand cooling articles. The Arabians treat of them very fully. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 446); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 475); Serapion (De Simpl. 92);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (i, 38.) Avicenna recommends the\r\ndecoction of its leaves as an astringent in profuse sweats, fetor of the\r\narmpits, in hot apostemes, erysipelas, herpes, &c. He also prescribes it\r\nin ulcers of the hands, and in burns. He says it cures ophthalmy, and\r\nproves stomachic and cordial. All the Arabians give it the character\r\nof being alexipharmic. It is useful, according to Avicenna, in heat of\r\nurine, and immoderate flow of the menses. He says it is useful also in\r\ncases of ununited fractures when poured upon the place; stops the flow\r\nof blood from the nose, and cures furfures and other ulcers of the head.\r\nAbenmesuai, one of Serapion’s authorities, says of the juice of myrtle,\r\nthat it is useful in the cure of pains of the breast and lungs, in cough,\r\nand looseness of the bowels; that it is a cordial, and strengthens the\r\ninternal viscera. Myrtle-berries were used as astringents in fluxes down\r\nto a late period. See Quincy (94.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΜῶλυ,\r\n\r\nMoly, Allium hirsutum, _Wild Garlic_ (some call it Ruta silvestris,\r\nothers Armalan, and the Syrians, Basanan); it belongs to the third order\r\nof calefacients, and is composed of subtile particles. Hence it cuts\r\nthick and viscid humours, is discutient and incarnant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It was the species of garlic now called _Allium Moly_, Mönch.\r\nMention is made of this plant by Homer as a charm against incantation.\r\n(Odyss. x, l. 302.) It is probably the same as the μώλυζα of Hippocrates.\r\n(See Dierbach.) Dioscorides merely recommends _moly_ pounded with the\r\nointment of iris as a pessary to promote the menstrual discharge. (iii,\r\n47.) On the _moly_, see Pliny (H. N. xxv, 8.) Galen and the other Greek\r\nauthorities mention it in nearly the same terms as our author. It does\r\nnot occur in the works of Celsus, nor have we been able to find it in\r\nthose of the Arabian authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάσκαφθον,\r\n\r\n(Called also Narcaphthon) is an Indian aromatic, and is used in\r\nfumigations for constriction of the uterus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of this substance is taken, with few\r\nalterations, from Dioscorides. Galen and Serapion also copy from him. In\r\nthe Appendix to this section we shall have occasion to notice the opinion\r\nthat it was _mace_. All we need say of the Nascaphthon in this place\r\namounts to this, that it was an Indian aromatic, which the industry, even\r\nof Royle, Ainslie, and Roxborough, has failed to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάπυ,\r\n\r\nSinapi, _Mustard_, is heating and desiccative in the fourth degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We may pretty confidently refer it to the _Sinapi nigrum_.\r\nNo author, ancient or modern, has treated of its medicinal powers so\r\nelaborately as Dioscorides. He says it has heating, attenuant, and\r\nattractive powers, and when chewed, produces a discharge of phlegm;\r\nwhen its juice is mixed with hydromel, it forms a suitable gargle\r\nfor enlarged tonsils, and for chronic and callous asperities of the\r\ntrachea; when applied to the nostrils in a fine powder it acts as a\r\nsternutatory; benefits persons in epileptic fits, and rouses those who\r\nare in hysterical fits; it is useful in lethargic patients when applied\r\nas a cataplasm to the shaved scalp; when mixed up with figs and applied\r\nuntil it reddens, it is fitting for ischiatic disease, and that of the\r\nspleen, and in general for all chronic pains, by determining to the\r\nsurface; it cures alopecia in a cataplasm; clears the countenance, and,\r\nwith honey, suet, or cerate, removes the spots of extravasated blood;\r\nwith vinegar it is rubbed in upon places affected with leprosy, and\r\nlichen agrius; it is taken in a draught as a powder, when sprinkled like\r\npolenta on the drink, for periodical attacks of fevers; it is mixed with\r\nadvantage in epispastic plasters and those for scabies; when applied to\r\nthe ear in powder with figs, it relieves deafness and noises in the ears;\r\nits juice with honey is suitable in dimness of vision and roughness of\r\nthe eyelids when rubbed in; the juice of its seed, while still green,\r\nis expressed and dried in the sun. (ii, 183.) Celsus recommends it in\r\na variety of cases both externally and internally; as a rubefacient,\r\ngargle, masticatory, &c. By the way, we have never been able to satisfy\r\nourselves that the late Dr. Milligan was right in setting down the sinapi\r\nof Celsus as the _Sinapis alba_. (207.) We remark, however, that it is\r\nthis species which occurs in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia. Galen and his\r\nfollowers dismiss this article with a very brief notice, like our author.\r\nThe Arabians do little more than copy from Dioscorides. See particularly\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 674); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 644); Averrhoes (Collig. v,\r\n42); Serapion (c. 373); Ebn Baithar (i, 355.) Mustard was much used by\r\nthe ancient physicians in cataplasms as a rubefacient. Ruffus, as quoted\r\nby Rhases (Contin. xxxvii), recommends the seed of mustard as a laxative.\r\nMacer directs, upon the authority of Menemachus, a sinapism to be formed\r\nby pounding in a mortar mustard seed, with a third part of the crumb of\r\nbread, dried figs, honey, and vinegar. He recommends an ointment made of\r\nfigs and mustard, for alopecia, i. e. _porrigo decalvans_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝαρδόσταχυς,\r\n\r\nSpica Nardi, _Spikenard_; the root of it is heating in the first degree,\r\nand desiccative in the second. It is also somewhat astringent, acrid, and\r\nbitterish. It agrees with the liver and stomach both when administered\r\nexternally and internally. It is diuretic, and dries up internal\r\ndefluxions. The Indian is stronger than the Syrian, and blacker.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. For this article, Dr. Royle informs us that he obtained,\r\nin India, the hairy spike-like roots of _Nardostachys Jatamansi_.\r\n(Antiq. Hindoo Med. 33.) Dr. Lindley says the Nardostachys Jatamansi,\r\nor true spikenard of the ancients, is valued in India, not only for\r\na scent, but also as a remedy in hysteria and epilepsy. (Veg. Kingd.\r\n698.) See further, Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 1, 318.) The Syrian kind was\r\nunquestionably some species of valerian, probably the _V. Hardwickii_.\r\nOur author, in the present instance, borrows from Galen, who in the\r\nmain draws all his information from Dioscorides. The latter holds the\r\nspikenard to be diuretic, stomachic, hepatic, and carminative. (i, 6.)\r\nThe Arabians treat fully of it, copying freely from Dioscorides. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 640); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 669); Serapion (c. 52.)\r\nAvicenna recommends it strongly in affections of the liver, and in\r\njaundice; and calls it stomachic and deobstruent. Averrhoes joins him in\r\ngiving it these characters. (Collig. v, 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάρδος Κελτικὴ,\r\n\r\nNardus Celtica, _Celtic Nard_, is possessed of similar powers to the\r\nabove-mentioned, but weaker, except with regard to its action on the\r\nurine; for it is hotter than the former and less astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Valeriana Celtica_, or French Spikenard.\r\nDioscorides gives an interesting description of it; and, with regard\r\nto its medicinal powers, states of it, that it is more diuretic and\r\nstomachic than the Syrian, and cures inflammations about the liver, and\r\njaundice and flatulence of the stomach when drunk with the decoction of\r\nwormwood; in like manner, that it relieves the spleen, the bladder, and\r\nkidneys, and is alexipharmic with wine; and finally, that it is mixed\r\nwith heating draughts and liniments. (i, 7.) It is the _Nardum Gallicum_\r\nof Celsus, who assigns it a place with other aromatics in one of his\r\nantidotes. (v, 23.) Galen and the other authorities treat of it in the\r\nsame general terms as our author. This species of spikenard long held a\r\nplace in our Dispensatory. See Quincy (161) and Lewis (Dispensatory, ii,\r\n125.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia the _Nardus_ and the _Phu_ are\r\nidentified with the _Valeriana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάρδος ὀρεῖα,\r\n\r\nNardus Montana, _Mountain Nard_ (called also Thylacitis and Pyrites), is\r\nweaker than the aforementioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would seem to be the _Valeriana tuberosa_. Galen and the\r\nother authorities state briefly of it, like our author, that it is weaker\r\nthan the other species already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάρθηξ,\r\n\r\nFerula, _Fennel-giant_; the seed is attenuant and calefacient. The inner\r\npart, while still green, is astringent; and, therefore, agrees with\r\nhæmoptysis and cæliac affections.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the authorities, including the older and the more recent,\r\nare agreed that it is a species of _Ferula_; and we are inclined to think\r\nthat it was the _communis_, more especially as its medicinal powers\r\nagree well with those assigned to the article in question by Dioscorides.\r\n(Compare the latter, Mat. Med. iii, 81, with Gray’s Supplement to the\r\nPharmacop. 80.) Dioscorides says, the pith of it, while green, relieves\r\nspitting of blood and cæliac affections, and is given with wine to\r\npersons bitten by vipers, and restrains bleeding from the nose when\r\nintroduced as a tent; that the seed relieves tormina, and produces\r\nsweating when rubbed in with oil, but that its stems induce headache, and\r\nare prepared for pickles. (Ibid.) Our author borrows almost word for word\r\nfrom Galen. We have not been able to discover it in the Materia Medica of\r\nthe Arabians, but can scarcely believe that it had been wholly overlooked\r\nby them. Ebn Baithar, in fact, under the head of _Kana_, sets down the\r\ndescriptions of the _Narthex_ given by Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάρκη θαλασσίη,\r\n\r\nTorpedo; when applied to the head, while still alive, in cases of\r\nheadache, it procures relief to the pain, probably by its peculiar\r\nproperty of producing torpor; and the oil in which the living animal has\r\nbeen boiled, when rubbed in, allays the most violent pains of the joints.\r\nIt is said to remedy prolapsus ani when applied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Raia Torpedo_, L., or Cramp-fish.\r\nSee Artedi (Ichthy.) Frequent mention is made of this fish in the\r\nworks of the ancient writers on Natural History. See in particular the\r\npoetical descriptions of Claudian (Idyll.) and Oppian (Halieut, ii.)\r\nGalen repeatedly speculates on the nature of the singular power which it\r\npossesses of stupefying every animal which touches it. He denies that it\r\nhas any narcotic effect as a medicine, unless when applied alive. (De\r\nSimpl. vii.) Serapion copies his account of it. His translator renders\r\nit _Piscis stupefaciens_. (c. 437.) See Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 49, 533.)\r\nAverrhoes compares its narcotic powers to magnetism. (Collig. v.) We have\r\ngiven some account of its application in this way elsewhere. See Book\r\nIII, 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝάρκισσος,\r\n\r\nNarcissus, _Daffodil_; its root is possessed of desiccative powers so as\r\nto agglutinate large wounds, even to the division of tendons. It is also\r\nsomewhat detergent and epispastic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems no reason to doubt that it is the _Narcissus\r\npoeticus_. Dioscorides says of it, that its root, when boiled and\r\neaten or drunk, proves emetic; that triturated with honey it is a good\r\napplication to burns; that in a cataplasm it agglutinates nerves that\r\nhave been cut asunder; that it relieves sprains and chronic pains about\r\nthe joints, in a cataplasm with honey; that it clears ephelis and alphos,\r\nwith nettle-seed and vinegar; that it cleanses foul ulcers, and breaks\r\napostemes which are difficult to ripen; and that in a cataplasm, with the\r\nflour of darnel and honey, it extracts thorns. (iv, 158.) Galen and the\r\nother Greek authorities give its virtues in brief terms, like our author.\r\nThe Arabians, as they are wont, copy freely from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 503); Serapion (c. 188); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n489); Ebn Baithar (ii, 552.) Rhases and Avicenna ascribe to it strong\r\npowers as an uterine medicine, stating of it that it produces delivery\r\nof the fœtus either dead or alive; that it promotes the dilatation of\r\nthe mouth of the womb, and relieves pains of it. The narcissus occurs in\r\nthe lists of medicines used both by Hippocrates and by Celsus. Our old\r\nherbalists, Gerard and Parkinson, repeat the characters of the narcissus\r\ngiven by the ancient authorities; but it has long ceased to have a place\r\nin our Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝευρὰς,\r\n\r\nNeuras (called also Poterium), is desiccative without pungency, so as\r\neven to agglutinate divided tendons. The roots have the same effects both\r\nwhen applied externally and when drunk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There are few articles in the Materia Medica of the ancients\r\nwhich it is more difficult to determine. Sprengel conjectures that it was\r\nthe _Astragalus Poterium_. Dioscorides says its roots exude tears like\r\ngum, and that they are highly beneficial in wounds of the nerves. (iii,\r\n18.) Galen, and all the other Greek authorities that treat of it, give\r\nexactly the same account of it as Dioscorides. We have not been able to\r\nfind it in the works of the Arabians. Our old English herbalists give a\r\nfigure and description of it, as being a species of tragacantha. See\r\nParkinson (Theatre of Plants, 996) and Gerard (History of Plants, 1328.)\r\nIt has long ceased, however, to hold a place in any Dispensatory with\r\nwhich we are acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝήριον ἢ Ροδοδάφνη,\r\n\r\nNerium, _Rosebay_ or _Oleander_, when applied externally is possessed of\r\ndiscutient powers; but when taken internally it proves fatal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Nerium Oleander_, L. We have treated of it as a\r\npoison in another place. (T. ii, 242.) That the plant actually possesses\r\nthe poisonous properties ascribed to it by the ancients is now very well\r\nascertained. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 600.) Dioscorides assigns it a\r\nplace in his Materia Medica, and says of it that its flower and leaves\r\nare destructive to dogs, asses, mules, and most quadrupeds, but are\r\npreservative of men, when drunk with wine, from the bites of reptiles,\r\nif mixed with rue; but that the weaker animals, such as goats and\r\nsheep, when they drink the decoction of it, die. (iv, 82.) Galen, like\r\nour author, in treating of this article, does little more than abridge\r\nthe fuller account of it given by Dioscorides. The Arabians extend the\r\nuse of this medicine to several cases in which it was not applied by\r\nthe Greeks. Thus, they say of it, that its leaves form an excellent\r\napplication to hard apostemes, and are good for prurigo, scabies, and\r\ndesquamations, more especially the juice of them; that in the form of a\r\nplaster they are applied with advantage in chronic pains of the back and\r\nknees, and that its flower forms a sternutatory. Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\niii, 31) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 522.) We have given the opinions of the\r\nArabians respecting it as a poison in the place referred to above. There\r\nis no mention of the oleander, as far as we have been able to discover,\r\nin the works either of Hippocrates or Celsus. The term _oleander_ is\r\nderived from the Arabians. It is treated of by our recent authorities on\r\ntoxicology, but has long been unknown to our Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΝυμφάια,\r\n\r\nNymphæa, _the Water-lily_, is possessed of desiccative powers without\r\npungency. It, therefore, constipates the belly and its seed is\r\ndesiccative. But that species which has the white root is stronger, so\r\nthat when drunk with dark and austere wine, it cures the female flux. But\r\nthat which has a black root is also somewhat detergent, so as to cure\r\nalphos with water, and alopecia, when rubbed in with liquid pitch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is quite manifest that the plant here described\r\ncomprehends the two well-known species of the Water-lily, now named\r\n_Nymphæa alba_ and _Nuphar luteum_. The two species, the one having\r\na white root and the other a black, are no doubt mere varieties. Our\r\nauthor abridges his account of this article from Galen, who, in his\r\nturn, borrows freely from Dioscorides. (iii, 138-9.) For the Arabians,\r\nsee Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 493); Serapion (De Simpl. c. 144); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 508); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) The Arabians administered it in\r\nthe same cases as the Greeks, and also recommend the syrup for coughs\r\nand pleurisy, and say of the plant that it induces sleep and cures acute\r\nvertigo, but is debilitating. They compare the nature of the nymphæa to\r\nthat of the mandragora. Though the two Water-lilies have long ceased to\r\nhold a place in our Dispensatory, they are still used medicinally by the\r\noriental nations. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 411.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΞάνθιον ἢ φασγάνιον,\r\n\r\nXanthium, _Clutburr_, has fruit of discutient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would seem to be the _Xanthium strumarium_, a plant of\r\nthe natural order of _Ambrosieæ_. Our author takes his brief notice of\r\nit from Galen. Dioscorides gives a minute description of it, but merely\r\nmentions its being used for a dye and a cataplasm for swellings. (iv,\r\n136.) It does not occur in the works of Hippocrates or Celsus, nor, as\r\nfar as we can discover, in those of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧηρὶς ἢ ξυρὶς,\r\n\r\nXyris, _Wild Corn-flag_, is possessed of attenuating, discutient, and\r\nattractive powers, and of truly desiccative, especially the seed, so that\r\nit is diuretic, and cures scirrhus of the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Iris fœtidissima_. It is still used medicinally\r\nin dropsy and scrofula. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 161) and Gray (Suppl.\r\nto the Pharmacop. 25.) Dioscorides recommends it as a vulnerary, and\r\napplication to swellings and boils; and further prescribes it internally\r\nin bruises, ruptures, sciatica, and diarrhœa. Its seed, he says, is very\r\ndiuretic, and reduces enlarged spleen when drunk in vinegar. (iv, 22.)\r\nGalen notices it in the same brief terms as our author. We have reason to\r\nbelieve that it is not wholly overlooked by the Arabians, but we cannot\r\nfind it, while writing this, in their authorities on the Materia Medica,\r\nnot even in the copious list of Ebn Baithar.\r\n\r\n\r\nΞίφιον,\r\n\r\nXiphium, _Bulbous Iris_; its root is possessed of attractive, discutient,\r\nand desiccative powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides gives such a minute description of it as clearly\r\nidentifies it with the _Gladiolus communis_. He recommends it on his own\r\nauthority as forming an excellent cataplasm with wine and frankincense\r\nfor extracting stings and thorns, for discussing the tumour called\r\nphygethlon, and as an emmenagogue in pessaries; and says it was reported\r\nto be aphrodisiac, and a suitable draught in the intestinal hernia of\r\nchildren. (iv, 20.) Galen, like our author, merely states its medicinal\r\nvirtues in general terms. The Arabians treat of it under the general head\r\nof _Lilium_, along with Iris. See Serapion (c. 189.) His account of it\r\nis made up entirely of extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. It is also\r\nbriefly noticed by Ebn Baithar. (i, 423.) His German translator sets it\r\ndown as the _Gladiolus Byzantinus_. We have not had time and patience\r\nto hunt out any other notices of it in the writings of the Arabian\r\nauthorities on the Materia Medica. Its name in the barbarous translations\r\nof their works is _Kasiflon_.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌη,\r\n\r\nSorbus, _the Service Tree_ (the fruit of which is by some called ὄα, by\r\nothers οὖα, Sorba); it is possessed of astringent powers, but less than\r\nthe medlar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Sorbus domestica_. All the ancient authorities\r\nrecommend the fruit as an excellent astringent. Dioscorides prescribes\r\nit with this intention both in fruit and in decoction. (i, 173.) Our\r\nauthor’s account of it is taken pretty closely from Galen. Avicenna\r\ntreats of it confusedly under the head of _Cornu vel Sorbas_. (ii, 2,\r\n315.) Serapion treats of the _Sorba_, but does not seem to apply the name\r\nto the article we are treating of. See De Simpl. (c. 109.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὈθόννα,\r\n\r\nOthonna; some say that it is the juice of a herb growing in Arabia, where\r\nit borders with Egypt, and others that it is an Egyptian stone. It is\r\ndetergent and pungent, clearing away everything that obscures the pupil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Tagetes Erecta_, African or French Marigold, seems\r\nlikely enough to be this herb. Regarding the stone of the same name,\r\nnothing is known for certain. Our author borrows from Dioscorides.\r\nGalen does not treat of this article at all in his work on Simples. The\r\nArabians appear to have been ignorant of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈινάνθη,\r\n\r\nŒnanthe, _the Wild Vine_; ample experience has shown that the flower of\r\nthe wild vine is considerably astringent, and that it acts as a tonic,\r\nparticularly in affections of the belly. Dioscorides describes another\r\nhaving powers quite opposite to this; and hence, he says, that it expels\r\nthe secundines, and cures strangury and jaundice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The former is evidently the flower of a wild species of\r\nthe _Vitis Vitifera_, L. It is still used for giving a flavour to\r\nwine. Dioscorides gives an ample account of its medicinal virtues.\r\nIts power, he says, is astringent, and hence it is stomachic and\r\ndiuretic, restraining fluxes of the belly and spitting of blood; it acts\r\nbeneficially when applied dry, as a cataplasm for loss of appetite and\r\nacidity of the stomach; it forms an embrocation with vinegar and rose-oil\r\nin headache; a cataplasm that restrains inflammation, when applied to\r\nrecent wounds; to incipient fistula lachrymalis, and ulcers in the\r\nmouth, and spreading ulcers in the pudenda, when rubbed in with honey,\r\nsaffron, rose-oil, and myrrh: it is made an ingredient of pessaries for\r\nrestraining bleeding, and for defluxions of the eyes and burning of\r\nthe stomach it is applied as a cataplasm with the flour of wheat and\r\nwine: when burnt upon heated coals in a shell it forms an ophthalmic\r\napplication, and cures whitlow, pterygia, loose and bloody gums, with\r\nhoney. (v, 5.) This account of it is copied literally by Serapion. (De\r\nSimpl. c. 35.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 723) and Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 745.) This would certainly appear to us to be the Œnanthe of Celsus,\r\nwho gives it a place among the diuretics. (iii, 21.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the herb of the same name, which, as our author remarks,\r\nis described by Dioscorides, various conjectures have been advanced. It\r\nis certain that it cannot be the _Œnanthe crocata_, but may be the _O.\r\nPimpinelloides_. We have nothing to add to the account of its medicinal\r\npowers given by our author from Dioscorides. In fact, with the exception\r\nof Oribasius, whose description of the articles in the Materia Medica\r\nis professedly taken from Dioscorides, we are not aware that any other\r\nancient authority has noticed it. We may mention, in conclusion, that\r\nthe _Œ. Pimpinelloides_, although it has no place in our Dispensatory,\r\nis still not unknown to the collectors of drugs. See Gray (Suppl. to\r\nthe Pharm. 79.) It grows in abundance on a spot in Banchory Ternan, and\r\nwe have ascertained that it is not wholly innocuous even to cattle when\r\neaten by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nΟἶνος,\r\n\r\nVinum, _Wine_, belongs to the second order of heating and desiccative\r\nmedicines. But that which is considerably old belongs to the third, and\r\nthe sweet wine to the first.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated fully of the ancient _Wines_ in Book I.\r\nFor an ample enumeration of their medicinal properties, the reader\r\nis particularly referred to Pliny (H. N. xxxiii, 19 et seq.), and to\r\nDioscorides (v, 1-16.) It being out of place for us to give a long\r\ncommentary under this head, we shall merely give a succinct exposition of\r\nit from Aëtius. Wine, he says, is of the second class of calefacients;\r\nbut that which is moderately old, is of the third; as in like manner\r\nthe new and sweet is of the first. Their dryness is analogous to their\r\nheat. Since we find many varieties in wine, we shall describe them as\r\nbriefly as we can. Of all wines, then, those which are at the same time\r\nred and thick are the most suited for the formation of blood, requiring\r\nbut little change in order to be converted into blood. Next in order to\r\nthese are such as are dark, sweet, and thick at the same time; then\r\nthose which in colour are red and black, in consistency thick, and have\r\nsome acid quality at the same time. Less than these are the white, thick,\r\nand austere, in regard to nutritive powers. But of all others the least\r\nnutritious are those which are white in colour and thin in consistency,\r\nbeing in so far like to water. But the sweet are sooner digested and\r\nmore readily diffused over the system than the austere, being of a more\r\nheating nature, and they are more laxative of the bowels. But those which\r\nare very thick are more slowly digested and more slowly distributed; but\r\nwhen the stomach is strong so as to digest them properly, they furnish\r\nmore food to the body than any other; and it is clear that they bind\r\nthe bowels and are not of a diuretic nature, engendering a thick humour\r\nin some. And some from them have obstructions of the liver, spleen, or\r\nkidneys, and hence those become affected with dropsy or calculus who use\r\nthem much, and especially old men. But of all wines, the best, and best\r\nfitted for persons in good health, and to those who are convalescent from\r\ndiseases, is that which is red in colour, thin in consistence, and gently\r\nastringent. (i.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὌισυπος,\r\n\r\nŒsypum, _Unscoured Wool_, is treated of under wool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Œsypum was the sordes collected from wool. It was used\r\nmedicinally in the Hippocratic age (De Morb. Mulier. ii), and continued\r\nto hold a place in the Materia Medica down to a late date. See Rutty’s\r\nMat. Med. (357.) It would appear, from Dioscorides’s description of the\r\nmode of preparing it, that it was the scum collected on the surface of\r\nwater by boiling wool in it. (ii, 66.) See also Pliny (H. N. xxix, 2.)\r\nThe ancients used it frequently in the practice of medicine. See in\r\nparticular Dioscorides (l. c.) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 355.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὌλυνθοι,\r\n\r\nGrossi Ficulnei, _Green Figs_, are possessed of acrid and discutient\r\npowers, owing to the juice which is in them. When boiled, therefore, they\r\ndiscuss hard swellings; but when raw they remove myrmecia and thymi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. They are the unripe fruit of the fig tree. Dioscorides and\r\nmost of the ancient authorities recommend them as a stimulant application\r\nto various tumours. Our author’s account of them is abridged from\r\nDioscorides, who further recommends them in a cataplasm with salts and\r\nvinegar for achores, furfures, and epinyctis, and as an application to\r\nthe bites of mad dogs. (i, 185.) They are the _Grossi Ficulnei_ of the\r\nArabians, who treat of them under the general head of figs. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 276.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὉλόστιον,\r\n\r\nHolostium, is possessed of desiccative powers with astringency. Hence\r\nthey use it for fractures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There are few articles in the Materia Medica of the ancients\r\nabout which there is so much doubt. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants),\r\nand Sprengel in Dioscor. (iv, 11.) It has been set down as the _Holosteum\r\numbellatum_, but all upon mere conjecture. Our author here copies from\r\nGalen, who in his turn borrows from Dioscorides. We are not aware of its\r\nbeing described by any of the Arabian authorities, nor have we found it\r\nin any modern Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈμφάκιον,\r\n\r\nOmphacium is _the Juice of the Unripe Grape_, being considerably\r\nastringent and desiccative in the third degree. Hence it applies to\r\ndefluxions, and especially those of the stomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The juice of unripe grapes is called _Agresto_ in Italy,\r\nwhere it is still used in affections of the throat. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it in such cases. Pliny says of it, “Prodest dysentericis,\r\nsanguinem excreantibus, anginis.” (H. N. xxiii, 4.) This is a literal\r\ntranslation from Dioscorides, who recommends it in these cases, and also\r\nfor various others in which astringents are indicated, such as aphthæ,\r\nloose gums, fistulæ, old ulcers, spreading sores, and as an application\r\nto asperity and ulceration of the eyelids. (v, 6.) Celsus prescribes the\r\nomphacium in a variety of cases, as a cleansing medicine, (v, 5), as one\r\nthat corrodes (v, 6), and as one that determines outwardly. (v, 12.) None\r\nof the other Greek authorities nor the Arabians supply any additional\r\ninformation of interest after Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈνάγρα,\r\n\r\nOnagra, _Tree Primrose_ (called also Œnothera and Œnothyris), is a\r\nsort of plant resembling a tree, the root of which, when applied as a\r\ncataplasm, proves soothing to the bites of venomous animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear to be either the _Œnothera Onagra_,\r\nTournefort, or the _Epilobium angustifolium_ L., Narrow-leaved\r\nWillow-herb, as Sprengel supposes. Dioscorides describes it minutely,\r\nbut, like our author, merely recommends it in malignant sores. (iv, 116.)\r\nGalen strangely, as we would suppose, says of it, that its juice is of a\r\nvenous nature, and of the same power as wine. As far as we have been able\r\nto discover, it is not to be found in the works of Hippocrates, Celsus,\r\nor any of the Arabians. It is worthy of remark that the _Epilobium\r\nangustifolium_, although it does not hold a place in our Mat. Med., is\r\nstill known to the vendors of medicines, and retains the characters which\r\nit obtained from the ancients. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 84.) This\r\nconfirms the conjecture that the onagra is this plant. We would further\r\nmention, as confirmatory of this opinion, that the _E. angust._ has been\r\ncultivated about gardens in this country from time immemorial, so that\r\nthere is every reason to believe that it had been introduced by the\r\nRomans, no doubt on account of its supposed efficacy in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌνομα ἢ Ὀνομὶς,\r\n\r\nOnosma, or Onomis, _Stone Bugloss_ (called also Phlomitis or Ononis), is\r\nacrid and bitter, and hence the leaves of it when drunk with wine kill\r\nand expel the fœtus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it was a species of _Anchusa_, or one of its congeners,\r\nis obvious, from the description of it given by Dioscorides, who says,\r\nthe stalk, the fruit, and the flower, are very like to the anchusa. It\r\nseems probable, then, that it was some species either of _Anchusa_ or\r\n_Lithospermum_. The _Onosma_ of Linnæus, as Sprengel justly remarks (Ad\r\nDioscor. iii, 137), is altogether a plant of a different character.\r\nDioscorides, like our author, says it has great powers in procuring\r\nabortion; nay, that it was alleged that if a pregnant woman walked upon\r\nthe plant she would miscarry. (l. c.) It is said that Aretæus recommends\r\nit in nephritic complaints. Pseudo-Dioscor. (Euporist. ii, 112.) Galen\r\nand the other authorities who notice it, do so in nearly the same\r\nlanguage as our author. We have not been able to discover any traces of\r\nit in the works of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈνόβρυχις,\r\n\r\nOnobrychis, _Cockshead_, is possessed of aromatic and discutient powers.\r\nIt therefore discusses phymata, cures strangury, and proves sudorific.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes it as having leaves like the lentil, or\r\na little longer, a stalk a fathom long, a purple flower, and small root,\r\nand grows in wet and uncultivated grounds. This description seems clearly\r\nto point to the _Onobrychis sativa_, a plant of the tribe _Fabaceæ_.\r\nDioscorides holds it to be diuretic and sudorific, and discussive\r\nof tumours. (iii, 160.) It appears to have been generally used as a\r\ndiuretic. Pseudo-Dioscor. (Euporist. ii, iii.) Galen gives exactly the\r\nsame account of it as our author; indeed, both borrow from Dioscorides.\r\nThe Arabians would appear to have rejected it from their Mat. Med.\r\nAlthough it has long ceased to occupy a place in the Dispensatory, the\r\nsainfoin, or cockshead, is still known to the vendors of medicines, and\r\nretains its ancient characters of being “ripening, discussive, useful in\r\nstrangury.” Gray (Pharmacop. 96.) Our old herbalist, Culpeper, ascribes\r\nto it the same virtues. (Complete Herbal, 52.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὌνοι,\r\n\r\nAselli, Millepedes, _or Slaters_; those found under water-vessels, which\r\nroll themselves into a ball when touched, are possessed of discutient and\r\ndesiccative powers. Therefore, when drunk with wine they cure dysuria and\r\njaundice, and in cases of cynanche they are rubbed in with honey: and for\r\nearache they are triturated with rose oil, and being warmed in the shell\r\nof a pomegranate are injected into the ear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Millepedes_ are thus described by Marcellus Empiricus:\r\n“In locis humidis et sordidis sub lapidibus inveniuntur bestioliæ\r\nmultipedes quæ contactæ contrahuntur et rotundantur.” (De Medicamentis,\r\nc. xxxv.) They are the Porceliones of Cælius Aurelianus (i, 4), who calls\r\nthem “animalia quæ humectis et aquosis locis sæpe nascuntur, a Græcis\r\nappellata onisci.” (Tard. Pass.) Almost all the ancient authorities\r\non the Materia Medica from Dioscorides downwards, recommend them in\r\nthe same cases as our author does. In fact, almost all the authorities\r\ntake the characters of the millepedes from Dioscorides. (ii, 37.) See\r\nin particular Serapion (De Simpl. 4, 29), Avicenna (ii, 2, 718.) They\r\nparticularly commend the use of them in jaundice. In English they are\r\ncalled _Slaters_ or _Cheslops_. They held a place in the Edinburgh\r\nDispensatory until after the edition of it in 1811. In fact, the highest\r\nmodern authorities testify to the medicinal virtues ascribed to them by\r\nthe ancient authorities. Moses Charras, who makes frequent mention of\r\nthem, says, that a volatile salt is obtained from them which is highly\r\ndiaphoretic. Dr. Hill calls them aperient, attenuant, and detergent. Dr.\r\nMead recommends them strongly for their diuretic property. He directs\r\nus to put them into wine, and afterwards to strain off the liquor, and\r\nsweeten it with honey or sugar. (_Monita et præcepta._) It would appear\r\nthat they are still used in France as diuretics. In Dr. Pemberton’s\r\nedition of the London Dispensatory, 1746, it is directed to inclose\r\nthem in a thin canvass cloth, and suspend them within a covered vessel\r\nover the steam of hot spirit of wine, by which they will be killed and\r\nrendered friable. Lister calls them lithontriptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nὊνυχες,\r\n\r\nOnyches, are the covers of Indian shell-fishes. These, in a fumigation,\r\nrouse those affected with uterine suffocation and epileptics. But when\r\ndrunk they disorder the belly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of the Onyx, that it is the operculum of\r\na shell-fish, like that of the Purpura, being found in India in the\r\nlakes that produce nard; and that it acquires an aromatic smell from\r\nthe shell-fishes feeding on the nard; it is gathered, he adds, when the\r\nlakes are dried up by the drought; the kind brought from the Red Sea is\r\ndifferent, being whitish and fatty; the Babylonian is black and smaller,\r\nbut both form a fragrant fumigation, resembling castor somewhat in smell.\r\nHe concludes with stating, regarding their medicinal properties, that\r\nboth rouse persons in hysterical convulsions, and also in epileptical,\r\nwhen applied in fumigations; that taken internally, they soften the\r\nbelly; and that the shell-fish itself, when burnt, has the same powers as\r\nthe purpura and murex. (ii, 10.) Avicenna gives a very accurate account\r\nof this article under the name of _Blacte Byzantie_; but except that\r\nhe does not attribute the fragrancy of the shell to the nard it feeds\r\non, his description is nowise dissimilar to that by Dioscorides. The\r\nmedicinal virtues which he assigns to it are exactly the same. (ii, 2,\r\n78.) Serapion gives a literal translation of the chapter of Dioscorides\r\non the _onyx_. (De Simpl. 443.) One of Rhases’s authorities says of\r\nthe _Blactiæ Byzantiæ_, that they are of a hot and dry temperament,\r\nbeing possessed of astringency and subtilty of parts, and that they are\r\nstomachic, hepatic, emmenagogue, and cordial. (Cont. l. ult. i, 127.)\r\nFrom the above account of this article, it will readily be seen that it\r\nis the cover of the _Strombus lentiginosus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌνωνις,\r\n\r\nOnonis, _Restharrow_, has a root which is desiccative in about the third\r\ndegree, but the bark of it is detergent and incisive; and hence it is\r\nlithontriptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Ἄνωνις.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌξος,\r\n\r\nAcetum, _Vinegar_, is possessed of mixed powers, namely, cold and hot,\r\nboth arising from tenuity of parts; but the cold prevails over the hot.\r\nIt is a desiccant of the third rank.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is also called γλυκάδιον, as the Scholiast on Nicander\r\nsays, per euphemismum, from γλύκυς, sweet. But we are rather inclined\r\nto think that it is the diminutive of γλεῦκος, must, vinegar being the\r\njuice of the grape which has lost its strength. Hence Pliny calls it\r\n“vitium vini.” All the ancient authorities maintained that vinegar is at\r\nthe same time refrigerant and discutient. Galen discusses the question\r\nregarding the nature of it at great length and with much ingenuity.\r\n(De Med. Simpl. i.) He, Pliny, and Celsus mention the fact that an\r\neffervescence is produced when it is poured on earth, meaning, no doubt,\r\ncertain carbonates. Pliny and Celsus commend it in the strongest terms\r\nas an antidote to the sting of the asp. Serapion and the other Arabians\r\ncopy Galen’s account of it. Symeon Seth gives an interesting abstract of\r\nthe ancient opinions on this subject. Dioscorides and Avicenna recommend\r\nit as an application to ecchymosis of the face; but the latter remarks,\r\nif too long continued it renders the part yellow and weakens the sight.\r\n(ii, 2, 74.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 18.) These two Arabian\r\nauthorities say of it, that it congeals the womb; but that a clyster\r\nof hot vinegar and salt proves soothing in the spreading ulcers of the\r\nintestines. Both the Greek and Arabian authorities commend it as an\r\nantidote in cases of poisoning with opium and cicuta. They also recommend\r\nan embrocation with vinegar and olive oil or rose oil to the head in\r\naffections of it. Dioscorides recommends vinegar for chronic coughs and\r\northopnœa, and also for defluxions of the throat and quinseys. (v, 21.)\r\nThe Greek and Arabian authorities further agree in recommending it in\r\nerysipelas, herpes, and whitlow.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈξυάκανθος,\r\n\r\nOxyacantha, _Evergreen Thorn_; the tree is like the wild pear in\r\nappearance and powers, having also some tenuity of parts. The fruit of it\r\nresembles myrtles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Matthiolus, Dodonæus, and Sprengel agree in referring it to\r\nthe _Mespilus Pyracantha_, or _Evergreen Thorn_. The commentators on\r\nMesue make it to be the Berberis, i. e. the _Berberry_. See the Appendix\r\nto this section. Dioscorides, after giving a botanical description of\r\nit, says, with regard to its medicinal powers, that when pulverised and\r\napplied in a cataplasm it extracts thorns and prickles, and that its\r\nroot is said to possess the power of occasioning abortions, when the\r\nabdomen is gently stroked or rubbed with it. (i, 122.) Galen says of it,\r\nthat its root is attenuant and incisive, resembling that of myrtles; and\r\nthat whether eaten or drunk it restrains all fluxes. (De Simpl. viii.)\r\nAlthough the similarity of names might lead us to suppose that this must\r\nbe the _Spina acuta_ of the Arabians, this does not appear to be at all\r\nthe case. Sec Avicenna (ii, 2, 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὌπιον,\r\n\r\n_Opium_, is treated of under poppy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Although we treated of the deleterious effects of opium\r\non the animal economy in the Fifth Book, and have given a general\r\ndescription of the medicinal properties of the poppy in the proper\r\nplace, we shall avail ourselves of the present opportunity to supply\r\nsome important information regarding the ancient use of opium in the\r\npractice of medicine. Though mention is made of “the juice of the poppy,”\r\nand of “meconium” as soporifics in the works of the Hippocratists (De\r\nMulieribus, ii), it does not appear that these articles were much in\r\nuse until a later age. “The juice of the poppy” is noticed likewise by\r\nTheophrastus (Fr. 20, 35), and the process of gathering this juice is\r\nbriefly alluded to by him (H. P. ix, 8, 2); but the nature of his work\r\ndid not lead him to say anything of its medicinal uses. There can be\r\nno question, we presume, that the “papaveris lacryma” of Celsus was\r\nopium, i. e. the concrete juice of the poppy. He prescribes it on many\r\noccasions, both externally and internally. For example, as an ingredient\r\nalong with hyoscyamus, burnt lead, and other ingredients for an emollient\r\nplaster to be applied in arthritic pains (v, 18, 29, 35), and as an\r\ninjection with alum, acacia, and henbane in earache (vi, 7); as an\r\ningredient in various collyria for complaints of the eyes (vi, 6); as an\r\ninjection in complaints about the anus (vi, 18), and in many other cases.\r\nThe famous Methodist, Cælius Aurelianus, is very guarded in his use of\r\nopiates, and he appears to approve of the opinion of those who held that\r\npoppy does not induce sleep, but oppression of the senses; “papavera\r\nautem pressuram non somnum faciunt.” (i, 1.) See also Pass. Tard. (i,\r\n5.) Dioscorides, then, is the first authority that gives a detailed\r\naccount of opium and its uses in medicine. Treating of the cultivated\r\npoppy, he says, that its juice is very congealing, incrassative, and\r\ndesiccative, when taken in small quantity, to the size of a vetch, is\r\nanodyne, soporific, concoctive, and is useful in coughs and cæliac\r\naffections. Taken in greater quantity, it proves injurious, inducing\r\nlethargy and death; it is beneficial in headache when rubbed in with rose\r\noil; and in earache when injected with almond oil, saffron, and myrrh; in\r\ninflammations of the eyes with the roasted yelk of an egg and saffron;\r\nand for erysipelas and wounds with vinegar; for gout with a woman’s\r\nmilk and saffron; and when applied as a suppository per anum it induces\r\nsleep. The best kind is that which is dense, has a heavy stupefying\r\nsmell, is bitter to the taste, readily incorporating with water, smooth,\r\nwhite, not rough, nor grumous, nor moulding like wax in the process of\r\nstraining; when laid in the sun softening, and when applied to a lamp\r\nnot burning with a smoky flame, and after being extinguished preserving\r\nits powers in its smell. He then mentions several modes of adulterating\r\nit which were practised in his time, and then adds, it is roasted for\r\nophthalmic medicines upon a recent shell until it becomes soft and of a\r\ntawny colour. Erasistratus says that Diagoras condemned the use of it in\r\ndiseases of the ears and eyes, as inducing dimness of sight and coma.\r\nAnd Andreas says, that if it had not been adulterated those that rubbed\r\nit in would have been deprived of sight by it. But Mnesidemus says, that\r\nthe only proper use of it is by the smell, as thus disposing to sleep,\r\nfor that otherwise it proved injurious; but these statements are false,\r\nas is proved by experience; for the operation of the medicine is attested\r\nby its effects. He concludes by describing the modes by which opium and\r\nmeconium were prepared, but it will be sufficient for our purpose to\r\nstate that his description of the former of these is exactly the same\r\nas the method now commonly practised. See Kæmpfer (Amæn. Exost. 643),\r\nand Pereira (M. M. 1274.) The meconium was the expressed juice of the\r\nleaves and head, and is not now in use. Dioscorides states that it is\r\nmuch weaker than the other. (iv, 65.) Pliny’s description of the opium\r\nand meconium is obviously taken from Dioscorides, or both these authors\r\nmust have copied from some preceding authority. He thus describes the\r\nmeconium: “cum capita ipsa et folia decoquuntur, succus meconium vocatur,\r\nmultum opio ignavior.” (H. N. xx, 76.) Opium it is certain was freely\r\nused by the Empirics, and accordingly it will be found that it is a\r\nvery common ingredient in the prescriptions of Scribonius Largus, and\r\nMarcellus the Empiric. The latter gives several formulæ for collyria, in\r\nwhich opium occurs, and he is at pains to state that it is the concrete\r\nand not the expressed juice which must be used. (De Medicamentis, viii.)\r\nHe also prescribes it internally for pains of the kidneys (xxvi), as an\r\nenema in colic (xxix), and in many other cases. Galen would appear to\r\nhave had very sound opinions respecting the use of opium in the treatment\r\nof diseases. He professes, indeed, never to have had recourse to it when\r\nhe could help it. (De Comp. med. sec. loc. iii); but yet he prescribes\r\nit in cæliac and certain stomach affections (ibid, viii), and even in\r\nintense pains of the eyes (Meth. Med. ii), although in general he\r\ncondemns the application of it in collyria. (Meth. Med. iii; and De Comp.\r\nm. s. l. ii.) He often mentions that castor counteracts the prejudicial\r\neffects of opium. (De med. sec. loc. iii, and viii.) Of all kinds of\r\nopium he pronounces the Theban to be the best. (De Antid. i.) Avicenna,\r\nbesides treating of opium as a poison, and giving the general properties\r\nof poppy, under that head, has a very interesting chapter on opium in his\r\nMat. Med. He defines opium to be the juice of the black Egyptian poppy\r\ndried in the sun. He says it proves fatal if given in a larger dose than\r\ntwo drachms; but the proper dose he states to be the size of a tare. He\r\nstates in parenthesis that opium is also formed from the juice of the\r\nwild lettuce (lactucarium?). He calls it narcotic and sedative of all\r\npains, whether taken internally or rubbed in. It is useful, he says, in\r\napostemes, especially in those of an inflammatory nature. He says of it,\r\nthat it dries up ulcers; with the yelk of an egg forms a liniment for\r\ngout; it proves soporific if a cloth smeared with it be placed below the\r\nhead; allays pain if injected into the ear affected, along with myrrh\r\nand saffron; allays chronic pains of the head, and sometimes cures them;\r\nsoothes the pains of ophthalmy, and the apostemes of the eyes, with the\r\nmilk of a woman; but yet he adds, that many of the ancient authorities\r\nhad condemned the use of it in such cases as proving injurious to the\r\nsight; it allays incessant coughs, and often cures that kind which is\r\nnoisy; improves the stomach in peculiar cases, when debilitated by\r\nexcess of heat and humidity, is braced by it; but in many constitutions,\r\nopium, so administered, impairs digestion; it stops diarrhœa; is useful\r\nin dysentery, and in ulcerations of the intestines. It proves fatal, he\r\nsays, by congealing the vital powers and extinguishing the innate heat;\r\nand its antidote is castor. He concludes by saying, that three times the\r\namount of the seed of hyoscyamus, or double of the seed of mandragora,\r\nmay be given as a substitute for it. (ii, 2, 519.) Haly Abbas treats of\r\nopium more briefly, stating in general terms that it is a soporific and\r\nsedative medicine. He seems to say that from half a drachm to a drachm\r\nwill prove fatal. (Pract. ii, 40, 318.) Serapion’s account of opium\r\nis mostly made up of extracts from Dioscorides and Galen, with a few\r\nbrief notices of the opinions held by Arabian authorities, which do\r\nnot contain anything of much interest. (c. 374.) Rhases’s chapter upon\r\nthe poppy contains many extracts from the Greek authorities on opium,\r\nwith a few from Arabian writers, which, however, contain nothing of\r\nmuch interest after what we have given from Dioscorides and Avicenna.\r\nLike Serapion, he says, from half a scruple to a scruple is a dose, and\r\nthat two drachms will prove fatal. His authority, Mesue, says it forms\r\nsemen. Another of them, Joannitius, seems to say that it binds the bowels\r\nin general, but yet has some laxative power. (Cont. l. ult. i, 533.)\r\nIn the ‘Book of Experience,’ as quoted by Ebn Baithar, poppy-juice is\r\nrecommended in complaints of the eyes, and in pains of the head when\r\napplied to the forehead. One of his Arabian authorities mentions its good\r\neffects in diarrhœa; and it is also spoken favorably of as an application\r\nto burns. Ebn Baithar’s account of this article is otherwise mostly made\r\nup from Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈπὸς,\r\n\r\nSuccus Cyrenaicus, Medicus, and Syriacus, are so named _per\r\nexcellentiam_, being considerably hot and flatulent. The Cyrenaic is\r\nhotter and more attenuate than any of the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The high interest which attaches to these articles might\r\nwell dispose us to wake our classical recollections, in order to\r\nillustrate the nature of them, if the narrow limits to which we feel\r\nthat we are restricted did not restrain us from such an undertaking.\r\nWe beg, however, to quote the words of one of our ablest authorities\r\nin illustration of this subject. Dr. Lindley, treating of the plants\r\nwhich yield assafœtida, says, “assafœtida is the milky juice of various\r\nspecies of Ferula inhabiting Persia and neighbouring countries. Of\r\nthese, F. assafœtida is the plant described by Kæmpfer. (Amæn. Exot.\r\n535); but F. Perscia and others, are no doubt also the origin of this\r\ndrug. The Asa dulcis or Laser Cyrenaicum was yielded by a Thapsia, and\r\nprobably _Thapsia Garganica_. This drug was in high reputation among the\r\nancients for its medicinal uses; it had miraculous powers assigned to\r\nit—power to neutralize the effect of poison, to cure envenomed wounds,\r\nto restore sight to the blind, and youth to the aged; these were only\r\na part of its reputed properties; it was also reckoned antispasmodic,\r\ndeobstruent, diuretic, &c., &c. So great was its reputation, that the\r\nprinces of Cyrene caused it to be struck on the reverse of their coins;\r\nand the Cyrenean doctors were reckoned among the most eminent in the\r\nworld.” (Veg. King. 776.) See further Pereira (Mat. Med. 1041), and most\r\nespecially Sprengel in Dioscor. (iii, 85.) From what we have stated,\r\nour readers will readily comprehend that the Median and Syrian juices\r\nwere varieties of the gum resin of Ferula assafœtida; while the Cyrenean\r\njuice was the gum resin of a congener, namely (as stated above), the\r\n_Thapsia Garganica_, called silphium by the ancients. That the Cyrenaic\r\njuice was the product of the silphium, is positively stated by Strabo.\r\n(Geogr. xvii, 3.) We shall reserve what we have to say on its medicinal\r\nproperties till we come to that article. It is the laser and laserpitium\r\nof the Roman authors. It occurs in the Hippocratic collection. (De Morb.\r\niv.) By the Arabian authors it is generally treated of under the name of\r\n_Assa_, and hence its modern appellation.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈρίγανος,\r\n\r\nOriganum, _Origany_, or _Wild Marjoram_; all the species of it are\r\npossessed of incisive, attenuant, desiccative, and calefacient powers in\r\nthe third degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Apuleius enumerates three species and recommends them for\r\ncoughs. (c. 122.) Galen and Dioscorides also describe the same number of\r\nspecies, which may be referred—the 1st, to the _Origanum Heracleoticum_,\r\nL.; the 2d, to the _O. onitis_; and the 3d, to _O. sylvestre album_.\r\nDioscorides describes the particular uses of these plants so fully that\r\nwe cannot find room for his separate articles on each. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that he sets down the first as being laxative, emmenagogue, and\r\nexpectorant. (iii, 29, 30, 31.) Galen, like our author, merely states\r\nthe properties of the _Origana_ in general terms. The Arabians call the\r\noriganum diuretic and vermifuge. They copy, as usual, from the Greeks.\r\nSee Serapion (c. 310), Avicenna (ii, 2, 526), and Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 125.) The _Origanum Smyrnæum_ occurs in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\n(121.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὉρεοσέλινον,\r\n\r\nApium montanum, _Mountain Parsley_, has powers like those of parsley, but\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of this article (_Selinum Oreoselinum_? or\r\n_Athamanta Libanotis_?), that it is diuretic and emmenagogue, and an\r\ningredient in antidotes, and in diuretic and heating remedies. (iii,\r\n69.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat of it in general terms\r\nalong with its congeners; and the Arabians do the same under _Apium_.\r\nSee in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 55); Serapion (De Simpl. 290); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 69.) Serapion’s Arabian authorities represent the Apium\r\nmontanum as being laxative, carminative, deobstruent, diuretic, and, in\r\nsome cases, emetic. The _Athamanta Libanotis_ is still to be found in the\r\nshops of the apothecaries, where it retains its ancient characters. Gray\r\n(Suppl. to the Pharmacop. 81.) Some of the commentators on Dioscorides\r\ntake it for the article we are treating of.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈροβάκχη,\r\n\r\nOrobanche, _Holly Rose_, belongs to the first order of the desiccative\r\nand cooling temperament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears unquestionably to be the _Orobanche Caryophyllea_.\r\nSee Sibthorp. (Fl. Græca. i, 440.) Dioscorides merely states of it, that\r\nit was eaten as a potherb both raw and boiled. The other authorities\r\ntreat of it very succinctly. We have not been able to discover any traces\r\nof it in the works of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌροβος,\r\n\r\nErvum, _Bitter Vetch_, or _Tare_, is heating in the first degree, and\r\ndesiccative in the second. It is also bitter, and therefore is incisive,\r\ndetergent, and deobstruent. When taken in too great a dose it occasions\r\nbloody urine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Ervum Ervilia_, Bitter Vetch. Dioscorides\r\nenumerates its medicinal virtues at considerable length, recommending it\r\nas being good for the bowels, and diuretic, but in large doses inducing\r\nbloody discharges from the belly and bladder; as being a cleansing\r\napplication in obstinate diseases of the skin, and in carcinoma and\r\ngangrene; as being alexipharmic and forming a good fomentation for\r\nchilblains and pruritus. (ii, 131.) Our author copies word for word from\r\nGalen. The Arabians treat of it at much greater length, but add little to\r\nwhat Dioscorides had delivered under this head. When drunk with vinegar,\r\nthey say it relieves difficulty of urine, tenesmus, and acute pain of\r\nthe bowels; promotes expectoration, and softens indurated mammæ. See in\r\nparticular Avicenna. (ii, 342.) Though this plant has long been omitted\r\nfrom our Dispensatory, it is still not wholly unknown in the shops. See\r\nGray (Pharmacop. 96.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὋρμινον,\r\n\r\nHorminum, _Clary_, is like horehound in appearance, and hot, moderately\r\ndesiccative, and detergent. It therefore is a provocative to venery; and\r\nalong with honey clears any thickness of the coats of the eyes, dispels\r\nœdema, and extracts sharp instruments. The wild is stronger than the\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author borrows his account of this article (_Salvia\r\nHorminum_) from Dioscorides. (ii, 135.) It is not treated of by Galen,\r\nAëtius, nor Celsus. It is fully treated of by the Arabians, who recommend\r\nit as an application to cancerous and other sores, as a collyrium in\r\nulceration of the eyes, and as a plaster in cases of gout. They further\r\nhold it to be aphrodisiac. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 692); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 727.) Even of late years, it has been reported as possessing the\r\nvirtues ascribed to it by the ancients. See Rutty (Mat. Med. 238.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὌρυζα,\r\n\r\nOryza, _Rice_, is somewhat astringent, and therefore it binds the belly\r\nin a moderate degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Oryza sativa_. Dioscorides, Galen, and the other\r\nauthorities state its virtues in the same brief terms. For the views\r\nof the Arabians, see Serapion (c. 13); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 583);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 567.) The Arabians recommend it boiled in milk, which,\r\nthey say, takes away its astringency, and it becomes more nutritious and\r\nforms semen.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌρχις,\r\n\r\nOrchis; the herb is also called _Dog’s Orchis_, or _Testicle_, having a\r\ndouble bulbous-shaped root. The powers of the greater orchis are humid\r\nand heating, and therefore it is a provocative to venery. But those of\r\nthe lesser are heating and desiccative, and therefore, on the contrary,\r\nit restrains venery. That species which is called _Sarapias_, and\r\notherwise _Triorchis_, is more desiccative than the former. It therefore\r\ndiscusses œdematous swellings, cleanses foul and putrid ulcers, and cures\r\nherpes. When dried it is more desiccative. Owing to its sub-astringency,\r\nit binds the belly when drunk with wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The modern botanists have described many species of it, and\r\nit is difficult to determine from among them those which are applicable\r\nto the two species described by Dioscorides and our author. Sprengel\r\nis pretty confident that the former is the _Orchis papilionacea_. He\r\nis undecided respecting the _Sarapias_, but we may venture to refer it\r\nto the _Orchis Morio_. Regarding the medicinal virtues of the former\r\nof these, Dioscorides merely relates the vulgar belief, namely, that\r\none of its bulbous roots had the virtue of rousing to venery, and the\r\nother of blunting the venereal appetite, and that the one promoted the\r\ngeneration of male children, and the other of female. However nonsensical\r\nall this may appear, the same properties are ascribed to the orchis by\r\nour herbalist Culpeper. (130.) The other orchis he represents as being\r\nan ingredient in applications to fistulæ, mortifications, ulcers of the\r\nmouth, and so forth. (iii, 31, 32.) Galen attempts to explain the reputed\r\naphrodisiacal virtues of the orchis upon its sensible qualities. Our\r\nauthor copies from him. The Arabians describe these two plants under\r\nthe names of Testiculus Vulpis and Testiculus Canis, or _Chasi altaleb_\r\nand _Chasi alchelb_. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 706); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 714); Serapion (De Simpl. 90, 91.) They ascribe the same real and\r\nimaginary powers to the two species as the Greeks had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌσιρις,\r\n\r\nOsiris, _Toad-flax_, from which besoms are made, is bitter and removes\r\nobstructions in the liver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides briefly notices this plant (_Osyris alba?_), and\r\nrecommends it in jaundice. Our author copies literally from Galen, as\r\ndoes also Aëtius. Oribasius borrows from Dioscorides. It does not appear\r\nto be treated of by the Arabian authorities at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nὈστὰ,\r\n\r\nOssa, _Bones_, when burnt are possessed of discutient and considerably\r\ndesiccative powers, especially, they say, those of men. The ankle-bone\r\nof a sow when burnt, is said to cure flatulence and tormina. And some\r\ncure epilepsy and arthritis by giving burnt bones to drink. The burnt\r\nankle-bone of an ox is said to fasten loose teeth; but if drunk with\r\nhoney, it removes round worms, and with oxymel it reduces the spleen,\r\nand when rubbed in relieves leuce. It is also an aphrodisiac. The burnt\r\nthigh-bones of an ox if taken in a draught, stop hemorrhages and fluxes\r\nof the bowels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The other authorities give nearly the same account of their\r\nmedicinal properties. See Galen (De Simpl. 11); Serapion (c. 464);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 528.) The Arabians borrow from Galen and our author.\r\n\r\n\r\nὌστρακα,\r\n\r\nTestæ, _Shells_, from furnaces, when triturated, are possessed of\r\ndesiccative and detergent powers. Hence they are used as a dentifrice,\r\nand when rubbed in with vinegar cure itch, exanthemata, and gouty\r\ncomplaints, and with cerate dispel enlarged scrofulous glands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is now well ascertained that _burnt shells_ consist\r\nprincipally of lime. They, may, therefore, be supposed to form a good\r\nstimulant application to certain cutaneous diseases and tumours of an\r\nindolent nature, as recommended by our author and Dioscorides. (v, 177.)\r\nOribasius says, that they are very efficacious in repressing fungous\r\nflesh when sprinkled in the form of a fine powder.\r\n\r\n\r\nὊστρεα,\r\n\r\nOstrea, _Oysters_; the burnt shell is possessed of similar powers to the\r\nbuccina, but is not of so gross a consistence. It is used, therefore, as\r\na detergent to the face, and whitens the teeth. When washed it is freed\r\nfrom pungency, and is useful for incarnating and cicatrizing ulcers\r\nattended with a copious discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen gives the same account of the burnt shells of oysters\r\nor snails. He says, that if a shell be washed and burnt it imparts an\r\nempyreuma to the water, which renders it heating and attenuant; whereas,\r\nwhat remains is devoid of pungency and terrene, and it is useful for\r\nthe filling up and cicatrization of ulcers. He recommends the ashes of\r\nall burnt shells as a dentifrice, in which case they do not require to\r\nbe finely levigated as they should be when applied to sores. (De Simpl.\r\n11.) This article is not treated of by Dioscorides, the reason of which\r\nprobably is, that in his time the word ὄστρεα was a term applied to the\r\nwhole class of the ὀστρακόδερμα. See Commentary (i, 91.) They are treated\r\nof in the same terms by the Arabians as by the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 529); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 224); Serapion (c. 443.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὈῦρον,\r\n\r\nUrina, _Urine_; all kinds of it are hot and acrid, but that of man is\r\nweaker than the urine of other animals, with the exception of castrated\r\nboars, but it is considerably detergent; and it is said that some who\r\nhave drunk it in the plague have recovered. It also cures leprosy, putrid\r\nulcers, achores, and furfures; and likewise sprains of the feet when not\r\ninflamed. That of boys not come to puberty is stronger, and from it the\r\nchrysocolla is formed. The urine of mules suits with arthritic remedies.\r\nThat of goats and of camels is laxative of the belly, and hence is given\r\nin dropsical complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The account given by our author of the medicinal properties\r\nof _Urine_ is abridged from Dioscorides and Galen. Galen rejects, with\r\ndisgust, the internal use of it. Some, he says, have given the urine\r\nof a boy for the cure of orthopnœa; but he justly remarks that there\r\nis no want of other remedies for this affection, and that in fact the\r\narticle in question has no peculiar virtue in the complaint. Most of the\r\nother authorities, however, sanction the use of it in this case, as for\r\nexample, Dioscorides, Avicenna, and Rhases. They also recommend urine to\r\nbe drunk for the cure of the bite of the viper, for deadly poisons, and\r\nincipient dropsies. Dioscorides recommends the sediment of urine as an\r\napplication to erysipelas; upon which practice Galen remarks that when\r\nthe affection is still hot such an application must be quite unsuitable;\r\nbut that when cooled, it or any other discutient is indicated. Those who\r\ndesire to know more fully the views of the ancients on this subject,\r\nare referred to Dioscorides (ii, 99); Galen (De Simpl. 10); Serapion\r\n(c. 448); Avicenna (ii, 2, 716); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 749); Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. ii, 517); Ebn Baithar (i, 191.) The last of these is\r\nparticularly full under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠανγράτιον,\r\n\r\nPancratium, _Sea-daffodil_, in appearance and powers is like the squill,\r\nbut is weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There are two varieties of the _Scilla maritima_, or Squill,\r\nnamely, the white and the red. The _pancration_ would appear to be the\r\nred variety. See Alston (Mat. Med.); Pereira (Mat. Med. 651); and Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 203.) Dioscorides, like our author, states of it, that it\r\nhas the same powers as the squill, but in a weaker degree; and that it\r\nis prepared in the same manner, and used in the same affections; for\r\nexample, in diseases of the spleen and dropsies. (ii, 203.) Galen and\r\nAëtius treat of it in nearly the same words as our author. We are in\r\ndoubt whether the pancration be treated of by the Arabian authorities,\r\nwith the exception of Ebn Baithar, who, it would appear, describes it\r\nunder the name of _Kebal_. He, however, merely gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (ii, 309.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠαλίουρος,\r\n\r\nPaliurus, _Christ’s-thorn_; the leaves and root of it are astringent,\r\nand hence they stop fluxes of the belly, and discuss phymata when they\r\nare not of a very hot nature. The fruit is of so incisive a nature as to\r\nbreak down stones, and relieve expectorations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would seem to be the _Paliurus australis_, Gaertn.\r\nDioscorides ascribes to it nearly the same medicinal properties as\r\nour author. Thus, he says, it is expectorant, lithontriptic, and\r\nalexipharmic, its leaves and root being astringent, so as to stop\r\nlooseness of the bowels, and that it is diuretic and discutient\r\nexternally. (i, 121.) Galen and Aëtius treat of it in nearly the same\r\nterms as our author. We have not been able to detect it in the Mat. Med.\r\nof the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠάνακες,\r\n\r\nPanaces, _All-heal_; it is from that species called Heraclium, from\r\nwhich the substance named opoponax is produced, being heating in the\r\nthird degree, desiccative in the second, emollient and discutient. The\r\nbark of the root being weaker than the juice, is somewhat detergent and\r\nincarnative, but the fruit of it is emmenagogue. The species of Panaces\r\nwhich are called Asclepium and Chironium, are more heating than the\r\nformer, and hence their leaves and fruit are used for ill-conditioned\r\nulcers and phymata.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides decides that the Heraclium is the tree which\r\nproduces the famous _opoponax_. It has now got the scientific name of\r\n_Opoponax Chironium_, Koch. See Pereira (Mat. Med. 1040), and Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 776.) Dioscorides gives a most excellent account of the\r\nprocess by which the opoponax is collected, and describes the marks\r\nby which that which is genuine may be recognized. He ascribes to it\r\ncalefacient, attenuant, and emollient powers, and recommends it in a\r\ngreat variety of cases, such as periodical fevers, rigors, convulsions,\r\nbruises, pains of the sides, tormina, strangury, scabies vesicæ; as an\r\nemmenagogue, and a medicine which destroys the fœtus; as a liniment in\r\nsciatica; a good application to the holes of carious teeth; as forming a\r\ngood plaster to bites of mad dogs; as an incarnant when applied to ulcers\r\nconnected with exposure of the bone; and as being alexipharmic, and\r\nremedial in hysterical convulsions, and in many other cases. (iii, 48.)\r\nGalen also gives an interesting account of opoponax, which he represents\r\nas being hot in the third degree, and drying in the second. He recommends\r\nit particularly in ill-conditioned ulcers complicated with exposure of\r\nthe bone. He says the fruit of the tree is emmenagogue. Aëtius treats of\r\nit in similar terms. The Arabians treat of this article at considerable\r\nlength, as usual following in the footsteps of Dioscorides. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 521); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 521); Serapion (De Simpl. 252);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) They recommend it in hardness of the spleen,\r\nin pleuritic pains, and chronic coughs. They say it softens hardness of\r\nthe uterus, and is useful in stillicidium urinæ. Both when taken by the\r\nmouth and in a suppository, they say it occasions abortion. Avicenna says\r\nthat galbanum is used as a succedaneum for it, and that gum ammoniac is\r\nnearly allied to it.\r\n\r\nThe authorities are much divided whether the Asclepium be _Cachrys\r\nLibanotis_, or _Echinophora tenuifolia_. The former of these would\r\nappear to be the _Libanotis_ of the ancient Mat. Med., and therefore\r\nthe latter would seem to have preferable claims. Dioscorides recommends\r\nit externally as a discutient application to ulcers and tumours, and\r\ninternally with wine as being an antidote to reptiles. (iii, 49.)\r\n\r\nSprengel inclines to think that the Chironium is the _Hypericum\r\noriganifolium_, Willd. Why modern botanists have applied the specific\r\nterm _Chironium_ to the first of these plants, we are at a loss to\r\nexplain. Dioscorides recommends it both internally and externally for the\r\nbites of reptiles. Galen and the other authorities treat of it in general\r\nterms, like our author. The Arabians in like manner give its medicinal\r\nproperties under the head of _Panaces_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠάπυρος,\r\n\r\nPapyrus, when unburnt is only simply the vehicle of other substances.\r\nBut when burnt it is desiccative like burnt paper, but the ashes of the\r\npapyrus are weaker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is marked _Cyperus Papyrus_ by Linnæus. From burnt\r\npapyrus and burnt paper prepared from it, the ancients procured an\r\nimpure carbonate of kali, which they used as a caustic. It is frequently\r\nmentioned by Celsus. Pliny says of it, “Charta quæ fit ex Papyro, cremata\r\ninter caustica est.” (H. N. xxiv, 51.) See also Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nThe papyrus was much used by the ancients for dilating fistulæ in the\r\nsame manner that prepared sponge now is. Avicenna recommends it for this\r\npurpose, and also as a styptic to stop the flow of blood. Its ashes, he\r\nsays, stop the spitting of blood. (ii, 2, 536.) See also Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 132), and Ebn Baithar (ii, 244.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠαρωνυχία,\r\n\r\nParonychia, _Mountain Knotgrass_, is so named because it cures paronychia\r\n(whitlow). Its powers are those of an attenuate and desiccative substance\r\nwithout pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The commentators are divided between the _Paronychia\r\nHispanica_, Cand., and the _Draba verna_, or Whitlow-grass. See Sprengel\r\n(Ad Dioscorid. iv, 54); Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 105.) Dioscorides and\r\nGalen join in commending it for the cure of whitlow. Galen argues that\r\nit acts in this case by being possessed of discutient powers. We have not\r\nbeen able to detect it in the works of the Arabians. Neither Hippocrates\r\nnor Celsus has noticed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠεντάφυλλος,\r\n\r\nQuinquefolium, _Cinquefoil_, is desiccative in the third order, but by no\r\nmeans acrid. It is therefore greatly in use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Although this article be minutely described by Dioscorides\r\n(iv, 42), Theophrastus (H. P. ix, 13), and by Democritus (Ad Geopon. ii,\r\n6), there has been considerable difference of opinion respecting it.\r\nSee Parkinson, Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. l. c.), and Rutty (Mat. Med. 382.)\r\nWe think that the well-known plant _Potentilla reptans_, Angl. common\r\ncreeping Cinquefoil, answers well to the descriptions above referred\r\nto. Dioscorides recommends it for a great many purposes: its decoction\r\nfor the cure of toothache, and mortifications in the mouth as a wash;\r\nfor roughness of the windpipe as a gargle; for diarrhœa and dysentery;\r\nas a discutient application to many tumours and cutaneous eruptions; in\r\nintermittent fevers, epilepsy, and, in short, as our author remarks,\r\nit would appear to have been much used in ancient times. Galen, like\r\nour author, merely states its general properties as a medicine, without\r\ndefining the particular cases in which it is applicable. It is the\r\ncinquefolium of Celsus, who places it in his list of things which are\r\ngently repressing and emollient. (ii, 33.) It occurs in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises. It is recommended by Apuleius for pains of the bowels,\r\nepistaxis, angina, &c. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 545);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 544); Ebn Baithar (i, 174.) They do little\r\nmore under this head than repeat the cases in which it is recommended\r\nby Dioscorides. The cinquefoil is highly commended by all our old\r\nherbalists, Parkinson, Gerard, and Culpeper, and it held a place in our\r\nEnglish Dispensatory down to the time of Quincy, who, treating of it,\r\nsays, “Schröder runs through most chronical distempers in commendation\r\nof it, says that it is astringent and vulnerary, that it cures coughs,\r\n&c.” (137.) Quincy here does not seem to have been aware that Schröder\r\nwas merely confirming the character of it as given by Dioscorides and Ebn\r\nBaithar.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠέπλος.\r\n\r\nPeplus, called by some Papaver spumosum. And this shrub has a juice and\r\npurges like the spurges.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠέπλιον,\r\n\r\nPeplium; this too has a juice, and grows by the sea-side; for the most\r\npart, it is of no use, but the seed of it purges flatus like that of the\r\npeplus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that they are two species of the\r\nEuphorbia or _Spurge_; probably the _E. Peplus_ and _E. Peplis_, that is\r\nto say, the petty spurge, and small purple sea spurge. These articles are\r\nfrequently mentioned as drastic purgatives in the Hippocratic collection.\r\n(Epidem. vi., &c.) Ruffus Ephesius gives them the character of being safe\r\nphlegmagogues and cholagogues. (De Med. Purgant.) Dioscorides gives them\r\nthe same characters. (iv, 65, 66.) They are also mentioned by Pliny (H.\r\nN. xx, 20), but are not noticed by Celsus. Galen gives their seed the\r\ncharacter of purging, and at the same time of expelling flatulence. All\r\nthe Greek authorities on the Mat. Med. down to Actuarius (Mat. Med. v),\r\ngive them exactly the same character. The Arabians briefly say of them\r\nthat they purge like the Tithymallé. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 103, 104.) We\r\nmay be allowed to mention, that although the _E. Peplis_ and _Peplus_\r\nbe now excluded from our Dispensatory, they are still to be found in\r\nthe shops of the apothecaries. We concur in the opinion thus stated by\r\nBoerhaave while treating of spurge root: “We have declined these rough\r\nmedicines too hastily.” (Mat. Med.) See further Rutty (Mat. Med. 520.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠέπερ,\r\n\r\nPiper, _Pepper_; its root resembles the costus in power. But the fruit of\r\nit, while yet germinating, forms the long pepper, being more humid and\r\nhot. But that which is as it were the unripe fruit is the white pepper,\r\nbeing more acrid than the black, because it is over-heated. Both are\r\nheating and desiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Solinus gives the following account of it: “Quod incorruptum\r\nest Piper album. Quorum cutem rugosam et torridam calor fecerit, Piper\r\nnigrum. Qui demum caducus torretur fervido sole, vocamen trahit de\r\ncolore. At quod ex ipsa arbore stringitur, ut est, album Piper dicitur.”\r\n(Polyhist. 65.). This is not quite a correct account of the matter.\r\nBlack pepper is the fruit gathered before it is ripe, and dried in the\r\nsun. White pepper is the fruit of the same plant, gathered after it\r\nis fully ripe and freed of its external coat by maceration in water.\r\nIsidorus says further, “quod immaturum est piper longum vocatur.” (Orig.\r\nxviii, 8.) It is now ascertained that the _Piper longum_ is a distinct\r\nspecies. Frequent mention of the peppers is made in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises. (De Morb. Mul., &c.) Dioscorides gives an excellent account\r\nof the pepper, and on the whole a very correct one, except that he does\r\nnot recognize the _P. longum_ as a distinct kind from the black and\r\nwhite varieties. He says of it in general terms, that it is calefacient,\r\ndiuretic, digestive, and detergent of obscurities of the cornea, and\r\nrecommends it in a great variety of cases, beginning with its use as a\r\nremedy in intermittent fevers. (ii, 188.) The use of peppers for the cure\r\nof intermittents is strongly recommended by Stephanus in his commentary\r\non Galen. (Therap. ad Glauc.) Celsus prescribes pepper for a great many\r\npurposes, as being calefacient, diuretic, opening the pores, &c. (v, 4,\r\n&c.) Galen, in treating of the pepper in his work on Simples, merely says\r\nof its medicinal powers, that it is strongly calefacient and desiccative.\r\nAëtius and the other Greek authorities copy from Galen. Avicenna treats\r\nseparately of the _Piper_ and the _Piper longum_, and although in one\r\nplace he quotes Galen as saying that the latter is a variety of the\r\nformer, he speaks of them as if he held them to be distinct plants. He\r\nsays of the former, that it increases the appetite, promotes digestion;\r\nand of the other, that it is aphrodisiac. He says the white kind is the\r\nmost stomachic; but the long the most laxative. On the whole, he agrees\r\nwith Dioscorides and Galen as to its medicinal uses. (ii, 2, 549, 550.)\r\nSee further Serapion (c. 357), Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 556), Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠέπων,\r\n\r\nPepo, _Pompion_, is possessed of detergent powers. Hence that part which\r\nis as it were the flesh of it, cleanses away freckles and the like. But\r\nthe seed of it removes obstructions of the kidneys.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to be the _Cucurbita Pepo_, L. See Book First,\r\nsect. 80. Alexander mentions that the seed of the pepo is possessed of an\r\nemetic quality. (vii, 14.) Dioscorides and Avicenna agree in ascribing\r\nthe same property to its root. The Arabians treat of this article at\r\nconsiderable length, recommending it externally as an application to\r\nobstinate diseases of the skin; and internally as an excellent diuretic\r\nand laxative medicine. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 89), Rhases (Cont. l. ult,\r\niii, 20), and Serapion (De Simpl. 251.) It is clear from Avicenna’s\r\nsection on the _Pepo_, that the term was also applied to the melon.\r\nIndeed, as we have stated more than once before, it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish the summer fruits of the ancients from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠερικλύμενον,\r\n\r\nPericlymenon, _Woodbine_; the leaves and fruit are possessed at the same\r\ntime of incisive and heating powers, so as to occasion a discharge of\r\nblood by urine when drunk for seven days. The seed is desiccative, and if\r\ndrunk for forty days, relieves affections of the spleen and dyspnœa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is either the _Lonicera\r\npericlymenum_, or the _L. caprifolium_, that is to say, either the\r\nWoodbine or the Honeysuckle. Sprengel decides in favour of the latter.\r\nDioscorides recommends it in nearly the same cases as our author, and\r\nalso says of it, that it accelerates delivery in labour. (iv, 14.) Our\r\nauthor’s account of it is condensed from Galen. It is not found in the\r\nworks of Celsus. The Arabians give rather a confused account along with\r\nother climbing plants. See Serapion (c. 41.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠεριστερεὼν,\r\n\r\nVerbenaca, _Vervain_, is so desiccative and astringent that it\r\nagglutinates wounds, and therefore stops hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is undoubtedly the _Verbena officinalis_. According to\r\nApuleius, it is styptic, agglutinative, and abstergent. He recommends\r\nit as an application to the bites of serpents, phalangia, and mad dogs.\r\nDioscorides, and most of the succeeding authorities down to Macer,\r\nrecommend it internally for the cure of jaundice, and externally for foul\r\nulcers. He describes two species, of which the second is the _Verbena\r\nsupina_. (iv, 60, 61.) Galen describes only one variety, and merely\r\nrecommends it as being a vulnerary herb. Ebn Baithar’s description of\r\nthis plant is entirely made up from Dioscorides and Galen. (i, 498.) We\r\nare inclined to think that it is the plant described in the translation\r\nof Avicenna under the names of _Pastus columbarum_, s. _palea_. He\r\nrecommends it as an application to erysipelas. (ii, 2, 551.) See also\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 530.) On its use by the Hindoos, see Ainslie\r\n(Mat. Ind. ii, 314.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠερσαία,\r\n\r\nPersica (_the Peach?_), is an Egyptian tree, the leaves of which are\r\ndesiccative and astringent, and therefore stop hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It has been generally acknowledged as the _peach tree_, but,\r\nas Alston and Woodville state, this supposition is attended with many\r\ndifficulties. Sprengel is by no means decided; but, upon the whole,\r\ninclines to the _Cordia Myxa_. With this opinion we are not disposed\r\nto agree, as we have stated in another place. See under _Myxa_. We\r\nwould hesitatingly, then, admit it as the _Persica vulgaris_, Miller.\r\nDioscorides merely recommends the dried powder of the leaves as a good\r\nstyptic in cases of hemorrhage. Galen and the other Greek authorities\r\ngive the same character of it. The Arabians, in like manner, follow\r\nDioscorides. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠετασίτης,\r\n\r\nPetasites, _Butter-burr_, is of the third order of desiccants; hence it\r\nis used for ill-conditioned and phagedænic ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides’s description of this plant with its petasiform\r\nleaf, leaves no doubt of its being the _Tussilago petasites_. He\r\nrecommends it only for malignant and phagedænic ulcers (iv, 106.) Galen\r\nand the other Greek authorities say the same of it. We have not been able\r\nto find it in the works of any of the Arabians except Ebn Baithar, who,\r\nunder this head, merely gives extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. It is\r\nstill used by the country people as an application to foul ulcers. It was\r\nretained in the Dispensatory as late as the time of Quincy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠετροσέλινον,\r\n\r\nPetroselinum, _Stone Parsley_; the seed is hot and desiccative in the\r\nthird degree, being incisive; and hence it occasions copious urinary and\r\nmenstrual discharges. It is also carminative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the species of Parsley called the Macedonian, and\r\nknown by the different botanical names of _Petroselinum Macedonicum_,\r\n_Bubon Macedonicum_, and _Athomanta Macedonicum_. As Miller remarks,\r\n“the Macedonian parsley is a stranger to our country, and not to be\r\nfound except in curious botanical gardens.” (Gardener’s Dictionary.) It\r\nis cultivated, however, on the continent, and its seeds are still to be\r\nfound in the shops of our apothecaries. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop.\r\n79.) It had not wholly disappeared from our English Dispensatory in\r\nthe time of Quincy (145.) Our author borrows his characters of it from\r\nGalen. Dioscorides says its seeds are fragrant, aromatic, diuretic, and\r\nemmenagogue; that it is beneficial in flatulence of the stomach and\r\ncolon, and in tormina, for pains of the side, of the kidneys, and of the\r\nbladder when taken in a drink; and that it is an ingredient in diuretic\r\nantidotes. (iii, 70.) It occurs in the works of Celsus, who mentions it\r\nas an ingredient in a confection for colic, and in other cases. (iv,\r\n14, &c.) Galen has a curious passage on the places where this plant was\r\ncultivated for the market in his time. (De Antidot. i.) The Arabians in\r\ngeneral treat of it along with other species of parsley under the head\r\nof _Apium_. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 55); Serapion (c. 290); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 69); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 388.) The\r\nArabians do little more than repeat the characters of it given by their\r\nGrecian masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠευκεδανὸν,\r\n\r\nPeucedanum, _Hog’s-fennel_; we use the concrete juice and sap as being\r\nconsiderably heating, discutient, and attenuant, both when smelled to and\r\nin a potion for affections in the lungs and chest occasioned by thick\r\nhumours, and also for scirrhous spleen. When put into a tooth eaten\r\nwith caries it straightway allays the pain; and it agrees with nervous\r\naffections. The root promotes the exfoliation of scales of bones, and\r\ncures ill-conditioned ulcers, proving calefacient and desiccative in the\r\nthird degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to be the _Peucedanum officinale_, Angl.\r\nHog’s-fennel, or Sulphur-wort. Dioscorides gives a very correct account\r\nof this plant, and of the well-known gum, or rather resin, which\r\nexudes from it. He says the gum is possessed of a strong smell, is of\r\na tawny colour, and heats the taste, and when rubbed in along with\r\nvinegar and rose oil proves beneficial in cases of lethargy, phrenitis,\r\nvertigo, epilepsy, chronic headaches, paralytic attacks, sciatica, and\r\nconvulsions, and in all nervous affections when rubbed in with oil and\r\nvinegar; that when smelled to it rouses from hysteric convulsions, and\r\nfrom catalepsy, &c. He speaks also of its being efficacious in coughs,\r\ndyspnœa and tormina; says that it loosens the belly gently, reduces\r\nswelling of the spleen, and greatly assists in cases of difficult labour;\r\nthat it is useful in pains of the kidneys and in those of the bladder,\r\nand that its root is useful for the same purposes, but is less energetic.\r\n(iii, 182.) Galen also has a very interesting section on this article in\r\nhis work ‘On Simples,’ explaining its action upon the principles of his\r\nsystem. Aëtius, like our author, follows Galen. Celsus recommends it in\r\npains of the joints as an external application. (211, ed. Milligan.) The\r\nArabians give it the same characters as the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n86); Serapion (c. 286.) The root and gum resin of _peucedanum_, although\r\nnow rejected from our Dispensatory, are still to be found in the shops of\r\nthe apothecaries, where they retain their ancient characters. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to Pharmacop. 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠεύκη,\r\n\r\nPicea, _the Pitch Tree_, has similar powers to the pine, but more\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We think there is no doubt that it is the _Pinus Cembro_, L.,\r\nor Aphernousli pine. The fruit of it, namely, the Cembro nuts, are called\r\nστρόβιλοι by the Greek authorities. Dioscorides says when drunk with must\r\nor the seed of cucumber they are diuretic, and allay irritation of the\r\nbladder, kidneys, and stomach. Taken fresh from the tree and bruised,\r\nand boiled in must, he says, they suit old and consumptive coughs. (See\r\nfurther under πίτυς.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠήγανον,\r\n\r\nRuta, _Rue_; the wild belongs to the fourth order of calefacients and\r\ndesiccants; but the cultivated to the third, dividing and discussing the\r\nthick and viscid humours. It also promotes the urinary discharge, and is\r\ncomposed of subtile parts and carminative; hence it restrains venereal\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The wild rue is the _Peganum Harmala_, L. The other species\r\nis the _Ruta graveolens_. According to Florentinus, it kills the fœtus in\r\nutero (Geopon. xii, 25.) Dioscorides’s two chapters on the Peganum are\r\nso long that we can scarcely attempt an abstract of them. Both species,\r\nhe says, are caustic, calefacient, ulcerative, diuretic, emmenagogue,\r\nastringent, and alexipharmical. (iii, 45, 46.) It occurs in the\r\nHippocratic treatises, and in the works of Celsus. Our author abridges\r\nthe interesting account of it given by Galen. The Arabians treat of the\r\ntwo species very elaborately, but in the main follow Dioscorides. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 571); Serapion (c. 300); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) We\r\nmay just mention that the _Ruta graveolens_ still retains its place in\r\nour Mat. Med., and that the seeds of the other, _Peganum Harmala_, are\r\nstill kept in the shops. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 116.) The Turks\r\nuse its seeds as a spice, in like manner as they were used in the time of\r\nPliny. (H. N. xx, 51.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠίσσα,\r\n\r\nPix, _Pitch_; dry pitch is desiccative in the second degree, but less\r\ncalefacient, while the liquid is contrariwise. They have some detergent\r\nand digestive powers, and also discutient and acrid. They therefore\r\nremove leprous nails, cleanse lichen, and digest swellings. But the\r\nliquid is more powerful, so as to be serviceable in a linctus for asthma\r\nand empyema. The dry is more agglutinative of wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny says of pitch, “Phthisicis etiam cyathi mensura quidam\r\ndederunt, et contra veterem tussim.” (H. N. xxiv, 24.) Averrhoes also\r\nrecommends it in such cases. (Collig. ii, 42.) See, however, more fully\r\non the virtues of pitch, Dioscorides (i, 94), who recommends the liquid\r\npitch in phthisis, empyema, coughs, asthma, and cases of difficult\r\nexpectoration; also as an external application to leprous nails, hard\r\ntumours of the uterus, fissures of hands and feet, &c. The liquid pitch\r\nof the ancients was evidently tar; the dry was the same boiled until it\r\nbecame hard. The latter is often called παλιμπίσσα. See Dioscorides (i,\r\n94, 97) and Pliny (xxiii, 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠισσέλαιον,\r\n\r\nOleum picatum, _Pitched Oil_, is formed from liquid pitch consisting of a\r\nmore attenuate substance than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Sprengel, the π. of Dioscorides is the same as\r\n_Tar-water_, so celebrated as the grand panacea by Dr. Berkley in his\r\ningenious work called ‘Siris.’ It is called ὀροπίσση by our author in\r\nanother place. (iii, 74.) The _Pissasphaltum_ of the ancients, according\r\nto Dr. Hill, was the _Pix Mineralis_, or Earth Pitch of the moderns.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠιστάκια,\r\n\r\nPistachia, _Pistachio Tree_; its fruit when eaten is moderately\r\nstomachic, and removes obstructions of the liver, and more especially a\r\ndecoction of the light and aromatic parts of it in wine. It also relieves\r\nthose who have been bitten by reptiles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the _Pistachio nuts_ in the First Book.\r\nThey are the fruit of the _Pistachia vera_. It is hardly worth while to\r\ngive the opinions of the other authorities under this head, as none of\r\nthem supply any additional information to that given by our author. See\r\nDioscorides (i, 167.) We may just mention in this place, that the oil\r\nof pistachio nuts was much used as an application to the cicatrices of\r\nsmall-pox. See Rhases (Contin. xxxii, 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠιτυΐδεσ,\r\n\r\nPityides, _the Fruit of Pines_, being possessed of mixed powers, the\r\nastringent and acrid, hence it assists expectoration from the chest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny restricts it to the fruit of the _Pinaster_ or Wild\r\nPine, but the Greeks apply it to the fruit of all the pine tribe. Pliny,\r\nlike our author, recommends it as a remedy for coughs. Here, however, as\r\nis usual with him, he merely translates Dioscorides (i, 87.) Our author\r\nis principally indebted to Galen. (De Simpl. viii.) Celsus places the\r\n“nuclei pinei” in his list of things which are particularly good for\r\nthe stomach. (ii, 24.) The Arabians treat of these under the general\r\nhead of pinus. See in particular, Avicenna (ii, 2, 301) and Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 42.) The latter enlarges on the virtues of them beyond his\r\nwont, ascribing to them powerful effects in disinfecting a pestilential\r\nstate of the air, in resisting putrefaction, preventing impregnation, and\r\nprocuring abortion. He also calls them vermifuge.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠιτυοκάμπαι.\r\n\r\nErucæ pinorum, _the Canker-worms of Pines_, are possessed of the same\r\npowers with cantharis and buprestis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the _Erucæ pinorum_ in the Fifth Book.\r\nAs they were seldom or never used in the practice of medicine, it is\r\ndifficult to see why they should have been allowed a place in the Mat.\r\nMed.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠίτυος φλοιὸς,\r\n\r\nPini cortex, _the Bark of Pine_; its prevailing power is astringency,\r\nby which it proves a useful application for intertrigo and burns. In a\r\npotion it restrains the belly. The leaves of it are also agglutinative of\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Pinus Pinea_, L., _Stone Pine_. Our author would\r\nappear to have condensed and abridged the more lengthy account of this\r\narticle given by Dioscorides. He says it is a species of the same genus\r\nas the _picea_, and that the bark of both being astringent, is a suitable\r\napplication to excoriations, to superficial ulcers and burns, with\r\nlitharge and the manna of frankincense; that it stops hepatic diseases\r\nwhen pulverized with copperas; in a fumigation promotes the expulsion of\r\nthe fœtus and secundines, and in a draught binds the belly and proves\r\ndiuretic. The leaves he recommends externally as a soothing application\r\nin cases of inflammation and toothache, and internally with hydromel in\r\ndiseases of the liver. (M. M. i, 86.) Of the fruit of pines, and of the\r\ntorch prepared from it (δᾴδιον), we have treated in their proper places.\r\nGalen’s notice of this article is to the same effect as our author’s.\r\nFrequent mention of the pine occurs in the works of Hippocrates and\r\nCelsus. The latter recommends its flowers in diseases of the liver. (iv,\r\n8.) The Arabians treat of the pine, and the virtues of the different\r\nparts of it, at great length. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 280, 301, 555, 693);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 63); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 341); Averrhoes\r\n(Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 137.) They borrow freely from the\r\nGreeks, and further recommend the different parts of the pine very much\r\nin diseases of the kidneys and bladder, especially calculus and hæmaturia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠιτύουσα,\r\n\r\nPityusa; some say that this is a species of spurge, because it has a\r\njuice and purges like them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There can be no doubt of its being the _Euphorbia Pityusa_.\r\nIt is briefly noticed by all the other writers on the Mat. Med. as\r\npossessing the same virtues as the spurges in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠλάτανος,\r\n\r\nPlatanus, _the Plane Tree_, is possessed of a humectating and refrigerant\r\npower. Hence the green leaves are of use in incipient inflammations. But\r\nthe bark and spherical balls are more desiccative, so that when one has\r\nbeen boiled in vinegar it relieves toothache. They also cure burns by\r\nfire along with fat. The burnt bark is more desiccative and detergent, so\r\nas to cure leprosies and humid ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Platanus orientalis_, L. The seed forms into\r\nspherical balls, which are called _Pilulæ_ by Pliny. He recommends them\r\nfor the bites of serpents and for burns; also when pounded with acrid\r\nvinegar, as a styptic for stopping bleeding. (H. N. xxiv, 29.) Pliny,\r\nhowever, merely copies from Dioscorides, who further recommends the\r\nleaves boiled in wine in defluxions of the eyes, and as an application to\r\nswellings and inflammations; and its rind boiled in vinegar as a gargle\r\nin toothache. (i, 107.) Our author is evidently much indebted to Galen,\r\nwho commends it for the same medicinal purposes, and warns his readers\r\nto guard against the down which grows on its leaves, as it may prove\r\nprejudicial to the windpipe, eye, or ear, if admitted into them. (De\r\nSimpl. viii.) Aëtius, like our author, copies very closely from Galen.\r\nNot much additional information can be drawn from the Arabians, who,\r\nunder this head, do little more than copy from Dioscorides and Galen. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 209); Serapion (c. 142); Ebn Baithar (ii, 422.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠνεύμων,\r\n\r\nPulmo, _Lungs_; those of lambs and swine are believed to cure the skin\r\nwhich has been chafed by shoes. But the lungs of a fox when dried are\r\nsaid to cure asthmatics. The Pulmo marinus, when fresh and pounded, cures\r\ngout and chilblains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, Galen, and Serapion give nearly the same account\r\nof the medicinal properties of _lungs_. The _Pulmo marinus_ is the\r\nspecies of _Medusa_ which bears this scientific name. Our author and all\r\nthe others follow Dioscorides in defining its medicinal properties. (ii,\r\n39.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολεμώνιον,\r\n\r\nPolemonium, _Greek Valerian_ (called by some Philetærium), is attenuate\r\nand desiccative. Hence some give the root of it in wine for ischiatic\r\ndisease, dysentery, and scirrhus of the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Polemonium cæruleum_, Greek Valerian. It occurs in\r\nthe Hippocratic treatises (Hippiatr. 108, ed. Basil), but is not found in\r\nthe works of Celsus. Dioscorides recommends it to be given for the bites\r\nof venomous reptiles, for dysentery, dysuria, sciatica, and diseases of\r\nthe spleen, and also as a masticatory for toothache. He further mentions\r\nthat it was used as an amulet for the sting of the scorpion. (iv, 8.) Our\r\nauthor copies from Galen, as does also Aëtius. We have not been able to\r\ntrace it in the works of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn Baithar,\r\nwhose account of it is made up entirely of extracts from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. (i, 186.) Though it disappeared from our Dispensatory long\r\nago, its root is still to be found in the shops of our apothecaries,\r\nwhere it retains the character of being astringent, vulnerary, and\r\nanti-dysenteric. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 55.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠόλιον,\r\n\r\nPolium, _Poley_; the smaller, which we use for antidotes, belongs to\r\nthe third order of calefacients and desiccants. It therefore removes\r\nobstructions of all the viscera, and proves diuretic and emmenagogue.\r\nWhile green it agglutinates large wounds, and when dried it cures\r\nill-conditioned ulcers if sprinkled upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The species indicated by our author is evidently the first\r\nspecies of Dioscorides, namely, the _Teucrium Polium_. The other is\r\nthe _Teucrium Creticum_. Both these plants retained a place in our\r\nDispensatory down to the days of Quincy (118), and both of them are\r\nstill to be found in the shops of the apothecaries. Gray (Pharmacop.\r\n49.) See further Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 23), and Rutty (Mat. Med.\r\n402.) Dioscorides says of both, that their decoction taken internally\r\nis beneficial to the bites of venomous reptiles, in cases of dropsy,\r\njaundice, and diseases of the spleen along with vinegar; that it loosens\r\nthe belly and is emmenagogue, but induces headache and is bad for the\r\nstomach; that in fumigations and placed below a couch, that they drive\r\naway reptiles; and in a cataplasm are vulnerary. Galen, Aëtius, and\r\nOribasius, give them nearly the same characters. Celsus barely notices it\r\nonce as one of the ingredients in the celebrated theriac of Mithridates.\r\n(v, 23.) The Arabians treat of the two species at greater length than\r\nthe Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 537); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 558);\r\nSerapion (c. 165); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) They agree with the Greeks\r\nin considering it diuretic, emmenagogue, and a gentle purgative, and\r\nrecommend it further as being anthelminthic and a remedy in cases of\r\nprotracted fever. Serapion, by the way, quotes Dioscorides as calling the\r\npolium aphrodisiacal, but there is nothing in the chapter of Dioscorides\r\non the poley to this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολύγαλον,\r\n\r\nPolygalon, _the Milkwort_, has leaves which are moderately austere. When\r\ntaken in a draught it seems to engender milk, being of a hot and humid\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it is the _Polygala amara_ seems quite certain.\r\nDioscorides and Galen treat of it in nearly the same language as our\r\nauthor. We have not been able to find it in the works of the Arabians\r\nexcept Ebn Baithar, who merely copies Dioscorides and Galen. (i, 186.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολυγόνατον,\r\n\r\nPolygonaton, _Solomon’s Seal_, is a mixture of astringency, acrimony,\r\nbitterness, and a certain indescribable nauseous principle, and therefore\r\nit is not much used. Some sprinkle the root of it upon wounds, and clear\r\naway spots on the face with it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It has been usually taken for the _Convallaria Polygonatum_,\r\nwhich has obtained the same character as a medicine in modern works on\r\nthe Mat. Med. See Rutty (M. M. 403) and Gray (Suppl. to the Pharmacop.\r\n23.) Our author copies almost word for word from Galen, who, in his turn,\r\nborrows from Dioscorides. None of the Arabians have noticed it, as far as\r\nwe can discover, except Ebn Baithar, who merely gives the descriptions of\r\nit by Dioscorides and Galen. It is not to be found in the works either of\r\nHippocrates or Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολύγονον,\r\n\r\nPolygonon, _Knot-grass_, has some astringency, but a cold watery\r\nprinciple of the second order is what prevails in it. When applied cold\r\nexternally, it therefore relieves ardor of the stomach, erysipelas, and\r\nhot inflammations. Being of such a nature it repels defluxions, and\r\nthereby appears to be desiccative. The male is stronger than the female.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Of the two species described by Dioscorides, the mas is\r\nundoubtedly the _Polygonum aviculare_, and the feminine probably the\r\n_P. maritimum_. How the latter could be the _Hippuris vulgaris_, as\r\nseveral of the older commentators on Dioscorides had supposed, we are\r\nat a loss to comprehend. Two plants so dissimilar as the knot-grass\r\nand the mare’s-tail, could never have been classed by the ancients as\r\nmale and female. Dioscorides gives a most interesting exposition of the\r\nmedicinal powers of the former species, but as our author borrows from\r\nhim, we need not dwell upon the other. It is possessed of an astringent\r\nand refrigerant power, and its juice (decoction) is suited to cases\r\nof hæmoptysis, fluxes of the belly, chorea, strangury, and so forth.\r\n(iv, 4, 5.) Galen taxes Dioscorides with not stating precisely what the\r\nparticular cases of strangury are in which it is applicable. Otherwise\r\nhis characters of this article agree exactly with those of Dioscorides\r\nand our author. Celsus ranks “herba sanguinalis, quam Græci πολύγονον\r\nvocant,” among things which are at the same time gently repressing\r\n(astringent?) and emollient. (ii, 33.) The Arabians who treat of the\r\npolygonum follow Dioscorides. See in particular, Avicenna (ii, 2, 725)\r\nand Ebn Baithar (ii, 195.) Our quaint old herbalist Culpeper, under the\r\nhead of knot-grass, assigns to it exactly the same medicinal virtues\r\nas Dioscorides does to the Polygonum Mas and although the _Polygonum\r\naviculare_ was ejected from our Dispensatory more than a hundred years\r\nago, it is still to be found in the shops of our apothecaries, where\r\nit has the reputation of being “a vulnerary and astringent herb.” Gray\r\n(Suppl. to the Pharmacop. 42.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολύκνημον,\r\n\r\nPolycnemon, is heating and desiccative in the second degree, so as to\r\nagglutinate wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It has been supposed to be the _Mentha arvensis_, but nothing\r\nis known of it for certain. Nicander notices it in two places. (Alex. 57,\r\nand Theriac. 359.) Dioscorides calls it a vulnerary herb, and a remedy\r\nfor strangury and inward bruises. (iii, 98.) Galen gives the same account\r\nof it as our author. The Arabians do not appear to have treated of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠολυπόδιον,\r\n\r\nPolypodium, _Polypody_, is possessed of considerably desiccative powers\r\nwithout pungency. When drunk it purges downwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of the root of the π. (_Polypodium\r\nvulgare_), that it is purgative, and is given to evacuate phlegm and\r\nbile; that it makes a good application to sprains and fissures in the\r\nhands. (iv, 185.) Galen and the other Greek authorities merely state\r\nits properties in general terms, like our author, with the exception of\r\nRuffus, who treats of it more elaborately. He says it evacuates phlegm,\r\nbile, and water; that it should be taken in mulse or water before a\r\nmeal, when it will purge gently, and thus prove an excellent laxative,\r\nespecially to children; but that in disease it is not a purgative\r\npossessed of much efficacy. (Opera, 14.) The Arabians, and especially\r\nMesue, seem to have attached more importance to it. See Mesue (De Simpl.\r\n5); Serapion (c. 248); Avicenna (ii, 2, 535); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42);\r\nEbn Baithar (i, 227.) Mesue recommends it in joint diseases, colic,\r\nhardness of the spleen, fevers connected with black bile, and fissures of\r\nthe hands. The polypody retained its place in the Dispensatory with its\r\nancient characters as late as the time of Quincy (137), and even in the\r\nage of Lewis it had not been wholly rejected. (ii, 244.) There seems no\r\ngood ground for questioning its efficacy as a gentle laxative. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to Pharmacop. 13.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠομφόλυξ,\r\n\r\nPompholyx, is desiccative without pungency, so that it is useful for\r\ncarcinomatous and other ill-conditioned ulcers. It is also an ingredient\r\nin ophthalmic remedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. What this substance was is well stated by a comparatively\r\nrecent writer on the Materia Medica. Dr. Lewis, treating of zinc, says,\r\n“Moderately pure white flowers sublimed from it in the brass or other\r\nfurnaces, wherein zinc, or its ores are melted with other metals, were\r\nformerly kept in the shops and distinguished by the names of pompholix\r\nand nihil album.” (Mat. Med. ii, 485.) A still later authority on the\r\nPharmacopœia describes it thus: “_Pompholix Nihil album._ Collected\r\nin the smelting furnaces wherein zinc ores or brass are melted; used\r\nin ointments for tutty.” Gray (Suppl. &c. 234.) It is also distinctly\r\ndescribed by Geoffroy (Treatise on Fossil, &c. Subst. 185), and by\r\nQuincy (201.) The latter writes as if he had been familiar with this\r\narticle; but it appears singular that the former says that in his time\r\n(that is to say, about 150 years ago) it was unknown in the shops. For\r\nthe ancient authorities on it, see in particular Pliny (H. N. xxiv, 33),\r\nand Dioscorides (v, 85.) The latter calls it styptic, cooling, and to\r\na certain extent escharotic. Galen recommends it in carcinomatous and\r\nall ill-conditioned ulcers, for those about the parts of generation and\r\nanus, and for ocular collyria. (De Simpl. ix.) The Arabians treat of it\r\nunder the head of Tutia. See in particular Serapion (c. 422); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 695); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43); Ebn Baithar (i, 217.) Hardly\r\none of them does anything more than copy the description of it given by\r\nDioscorides and Galen, only comprehending under one name what the Greeks\r\nhad delivered regarding pompholyx and spodium separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠορφύραι,\r\n\r\nPurpuræ, when burnt are possessed of the same powers as shells. The part\r\nwhich serves as a cover to them when boiled in oil, strengthens hairs\r\nthat are falling out. When drunk with vinegar, they cure swelling of the\r\nspleen. As a fumigation, they rouse in cases of uterine suffocation, and\r\nexpel the secundines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The shell-fishes which supply the purple dye. It is got\r\nfrom various fishes, but more especially the _Helix ianthina_, _Murex\r\nbrandaris_ and _trunculus_. For an account of them, see particularly\r\nAristot. (Hist. Animal. v, 14), and Pliny (H. N. ix, 60.) Our author\r\nborrows from Dioscorides (iii, 4), and Galen (De Simpl. xi.) We have not\r\nbeen able to detect this article in the works of the Arabian authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠοταμογείτων,\r\n\r\nPotamogiton, _Pondweed_, is cooling and astringent, like Polygonum, being\r\npossessed of similar powers to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Potamogiton natans_, L. Dioscorides says of\r\nit, that it is cooling and astringent, and is applicable in cases of\r\npruritus, and in spreading and inveterate ulcers. (iv, 99.) In some of\r\nthe editions of his works, another species is described and recommended\r\nin dysentery, colic, and the red fluor of females. It cannot be so\r\ndecidedly determined. Galen and the other authorities treat of it in\r\ngeneral terms, like our author. Such of the Arabians as treat of it\r\nborrow from Dioscorides. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 352.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠοτέρριον,\r\n\r\nPoterrhium, (called by some Phrœnium); its roots when cut into slices\r\nagglutinate divided tendons and wounds; and the decoction of it when\r\ndrunk relieves affections of the nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Matthiolus confesses his ignorance of it. Sprengel is\r\ninclined to think that it is the _Astragalus Poterium_, Pall. But\r\nDr. Lindley holds it to be _Astragalus Creticus_. (Veg. King. 548.)\r\nDioscorides says it has stalks like those of tragacanth, and accordingly\r\nLinnæus holds this plant to be a species of tragacanth. He recommends\r\nit in exactly the same cases as our author. Galen describes it by the\r\nname of _Neuras_. We have not been able to detect it in the works of the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠράσιον,\r\n\r\nMarrabium, _Horehound_, is calefacient in the second degree; but more\r\ndesiccative. It removes obstructions about the liver and spleen, and\r\nthose of the chest and lungs. It also promotes menstruation. In a\r\ncataplasm it is detergent and discutient, and otherwise it is detergent\r\nand incisive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Marrubium vulgare_. Dioscorides has an elaborate section\r\non the virtues of this article, which he recommends particularly in\r\nphthisical, asthmatic, and catarrhal complaints, as being an excellent\r\nexpectorant, for promoting the menstrual and lochial discharges, as an\r\nalexipharmic, &c. He adds, however, that it is unsuitable in affections\r\nof the kidneys and bladder. (iii, 109.) Galen writes thus of it:\r\n“Horehound, as it is bitter in taste, so, by general admission, it has\r\nthe virtue corresponding to that taste, being a deobstruent of the\r\nliver and spleen, clearing away matters about the chest and lungs, and\r\npromoting menstruation.” He also mentions its use in a cataplasm and in\r\nother cases, as stated by Dioscorides. Aëtius and Oribasius state its\r\nvirtues in nearly the same terms. It is the “Marrubium” of Celsus, who\r\nprescribes the juice of it in phthisis (iii, 22), in paralysis (iii,\r\n27), in ulcers of the throat (iv, 4), and for other purposes. For the\r\nArabians, see in particular Serapion (c. 198); Avicenna (ii, 2, 553);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) Avicenna recommends it as deobstruent,\r\nemmenagogue, and an application to the eyes. Serapion also praises it as\r\na deobstruent, and recommends it particularly in ulcers of the lungs,\r\nasthma, and such like complaints. It would seem to deserve the characters\r\nwhich the ancient authorities give it from Hippocrates down to Macer\r\nFloridus and Serapion. See Rutty (Mat. Med. 309.) Even yet it holds a\r\nplace in the Dispensatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠράσον,\r\n\r\nPorrum, _Leek_, consists of unwholesome juice and is acrid; but\r\nDioscorides says, that it induces disagreeable dreams, agrees well with\r\nthe bowels, is diuretic and attenuant. It is also detergent, for it\r\nproves expectorant when boiled in ptisan. The seed of it is mixed with\r\nnephritic remedies. But the leaves have some astringency, and therefore\r\nthe juice of it proves styptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Allium Porrum_, L. Diphilus, as\r\nquoted by Athenæus says, “it is attenuant, nutritious, and flatulent.”\r\n(Deipnos, ix, 3.) Dioscorides recommends it in the cases enumerated by\r\nour author, and also in several others. (ii, 178.) Galen does not treat\r\nof it at all in his work on Simples. The Arabians attach more importance\r\nto it, recommending it as being emmenagogue, diuretic, aphrodisiac, and\r\nso forth. They say of it that it hurts the eyes, the gums, and the teeth.\r\nSee in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 540); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 562);\r\nSerapion (c. 361); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 339.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠρίνος,\r\n\r\nIlex, _the Holm Oak_, has powers resembling those of the oak, but it is\r\nmuch stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Quercus Ilex_, or _Evergreen Oak_. All the\r\nauthorities speak of it as being a powerful astringent. The _Kermes_, or\r\nScarlet Grain is produced upon the ilex by a certain class of insects. It\r\nis described by Theophrastus and Pliny, as stated under that head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠρόπολις,\r\n\r\nPropolis, _Virgin-wax_, or _Bee-glue_, is calefacient in the second\r\ndegree and moderately detergent. It is also possessed of attenuant and\r\ndeobstruent powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Scribonius Largus calls it, “Propolis quam quidam sacram\r\nceram vocant.” Dioscorides and Galen give nearly the same account of\r\n_Bee-glue_ as our author. It is the glutinous substance with which the\r\nworking bees block up the holes in their hive. They gather it from\r\npoplars and other resinous plants. It occurs frequently in the works of\r\nthe ancient writers on Pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠταρμικὴ,\r\n\r\nPtarmica, _Sneezewort_; the leaves are sternutatory; but the whole part,\r\nwhen green, removes hypopion and other kinds of ecchymosis, for it is hot\r\nand desiccative. The green belong to the second order, and the dried to\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides’s description of it agrees well with the\r\n_Achillea Ptarmica_, except that (as is remarked by Sprengel) its\r\nfavorite locality is meadows, and not mountainous and rocky situations\r\nas indicated by Dioscorides. All the Greek authorities, from Dioscorides\r\ndownwards, give it exactly the same characters as our author. We have not\r\nbeen able to discover any traces of it in the works of the Arabians. Its\r\nleaves are still kept in the shops of apothecaries, and are held to be\r\nsternutatory. Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΠτελάια,\r\n\r\nUlmus, _the Elm_, is possessed of desiccative and detergent powers, so\r\nas to agglutinate wounds; but the bark of it still more, if, when in\r\na fresh state, it be wrapped like a bandage about the wounds. It also\r\ncures leprosy with vinegar, and the roots of it are possessed of the same\r\npowers, so that fractures which will not unite are to be bathed with the\r\ndecoction of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Most probably the _Ulmus campestris_. Our author’s statement\r\nof its medicinal virtues is closely copied from Dioscorides (i, 112.)\r\nGalen and most of the authorities represent it to be an agglutinative\r\nmedicine. Pliny, like the others, recommends it as an application to\r\nleprosy. No mention of it occurs in the works of Celsus. The Arabians\r\ntreat of it fully, but in the main follow Dioscorides. See Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 71, 96, 212); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 250.) They recommend it in all\r\ncases requiring astringents and abstergents.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠτερὶς,\r\n\r\nFilix, _Fern_, is desiccative in its powers, and bitter. Hence it\r\ndestroys the fœtus, and kills the broad intestinal worm when taken to\r\nthe amount of four drachms in honeyed water. Because it is moderately\r\nastringent, it dries up ulcers without pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Apuleius says, “Græci pterin, Latini filicem nominant.” (De\r\nHerbis.) We need not hesitate to refer it to the _Aspidium Filix Mas_,\r\nwhich has been long celebrated as a vermifuge medicine. See Book IV,\r\n67, of this work, and Rutty (Mat. Med. 201.) Dioscorides recommends it\r\nmerely as an anthelminthic medicine, and as one which is calculated to\r\npromote convalescence in diseases of the spleen. For the former purpose\r\nhe directs it to be given with scammony or white hellebore, along with a\r\ndiet consisting principally of garlic. (iv, 183.) Galen acutely remarks,\r\nthat there is no wonder that it should be anthelminthic, seeing it is\r\npossessed of a bitter taste with some astringency. None of the other\r\nGreek or Arabian authorities supply any additional information respecting\r\nit. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 620); Serapion (De Simpl. 56.) The\r\n“filicula” of Celsus (ii, 12) would appear to us to have been rather the\r\nPolypodium than the Filix Mas. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is\r\nmarked as being the _Aspidium Filix Mas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠυκνόκομον,\r\n\r\nPycnocomon, is possessed of discutient, attractive, and acrid powers.\r\nThe leaves of it, therefore, discuss phyma and furunculus. The fruit, in\r\naddition to these properties, also extracts sharp-pointed weapons. Its\r\nroot purges yellow bile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Although Dioscorides has given a pretty minute description\r\nof it, there are few articles in the ancient Mat. Med. about which there\r\nis so much uncertainty. See the Index Latinus to Parkinson’s ‘Theatre\r\nof Plants,’ and Sprengel (in Dioscor. iv, 173.) The latter decides that\r\nit is neither the _Leonurus Marrubiastrum_ nor the _Succisa pratensis_\r\nas had been supposed. Whether it may be the _Cephalaria Pycnocomon_ we\r\nare unable to determine, as we have no acquaintance with this plant. Our\r\nauthor borrows his medicinal characters of it from Dioscorides (l. c.)\r\nGalen does the same. The Arabians have not noticed it, as far as we can\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠύρεθρον,\r\n\r\nPyrethrum, _Pellitory_; the root has caustic powers, and allays the pain\r\nof teeth affected with cold; and before the occurrence of periodical\r\nrigors it is rubbed in with oil, and relieves those who are affected with\r\ntorpor and paralysis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It seems to be the _Anthemis Pyrethrum_, although Sprengel\r\nis not quite satisfied. It was much used in stimulant embrocations.\r\nDioscorides, Galen, Macer, and Serapion, and, in a word, all the\r\nauthorities, recommend it strongly as a phlegmagogue for toothache.\r\nDioscorides says further of it, that when rubbed in with oil, it is\r\nsudorific, being serviceable in chronic rigors, for parts which have lost\r\ntheir natural heat and are paralysed. (iii, 37.) Celsus also mentions\r\nit in a list of stimulants, to be applied externally for toothache (vi,\r\n9), and ranks it among his caustics. (v, 8.) The Arabians treat of it at\r\nconsiderable length, but borrow much from Dioscorides. See in particular\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 547); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 553); Averrhoes (Collig.\r\nv, 42.) They all in particular recommend it as a sialogogue in cases\r\nof toothache. We need scarcely remark that the pellitory (now called\r\n_Anacyclos Pyrethrum_) still holds its place in the Dispensatory as\r\na sialogogue and masticatory. We see no good reason, therefore, for\r\nquestioning its identity with the pyrethrum of the ancients, more\r\nespecially as it still retains a place in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠυρὸς,\r\n\r\nTriticum, _Wheat_, is heating in the first degree, but is intermediate\r\nbetween dry and humid substances. It is also somewhat glutinous and\r\nemplastic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Triticum æstivum_. We have treated\r\nlargely of it among the dietetical articles in the First Book, and have\r\nalso treated of the farina, leaven, and pollen of wheat separately. We\r\nneed not, then, enlarge further upon this article at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nΠιτύα,\r\n\r\nCoagulum, _Rennet_; all sorts of it are possessed of acrid, attenuating,\r\ndiscutient, and decidedly desiccant powers. But that of hares is\r\nrepresented as curing epilepsy if drunk with vinegar, and as curing the\r\nfemale discharge, and proving a solvent of coagulated milk in the bowels,\r\nand of blood in like manner. Some say that it restrains spitting of blood\r\nfrom the chest. The rennet of a horse is described as proving serviceable\r\nin cæliac and dysenteric affections. That of the seal is said to have the\r\nproperties of castor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _Rennet_\r\nis taken from Dioscorides and Galen. Indeed he has copied from the latter\r\nalmost word for word. The Arabians treat of the rennets very fully and\r\nwith much judgment. See in particular Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 221);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 115); Serapion (De Simpl. 444); Ebn Baithar (ii, 604.)\r\nThey follow Dioscorides very closely, among other things recommending\r\nrennet to be applied on a pessary for promoting the menstrual discharge,\r\nand for the hysterical convulsion. All rennets, they say, are\r\nalexipharmic, and especially those of the kid, of the antelope, and of\r\nthe camel. As stated by us in the Fifth Book, the ancients administered\r\nrennet in cases of poisoning with curdled milk. It appears remarkable\r\nthat an article unquestionably capable of being applied to so many\r\nmedicinal purposes as rennet, should have been entirely excluded from our\r\nmodern Dispensatories.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬακὸς,\r\n\r\nPanniculus, _Rags_; when those from wool are burnt they have similar\r\npowers to burnt wool. Linen, when burning, sends forth a subtile smoke,\r\nso as to prove deobstruent in catarrhs, and agree with risings of the\r\nwomb. When burnt, its powers are nearly the same as those of wool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These things are so well known as not to require further\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬάμνος,\r\n\r\nRhamnus, _Buckthorn_, is desiccative in the second degree, but cooling in\r\nthe first. Hence it cures herpes and erysipelas when not very hot. Its\r\ntender leaves are to be used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This appears to be the first species of Dioscorides, which\r\nwe may decide to be the _Lycium Europæum_. The second is the _Lycium\r\nAfrum_. The third is not well ascertained, but probably is a species of\r\n_paliurus_. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 1006), and Sprengel (Ad\r\nDioscor. i, 119.) Dioscorides recommends the leaves of all the three\r\nkinds for herpes and erysipelas, and also mentions that the twigs of\r\nthem were placed in doors and windows to avert sorcery. (i, 119.) Galen\r\nand the other Greek authorities treat of this article in nearly the same\r\nterms as our author. Pliny recommends it as a cooling and refrigerant\r\napplication. (H. N. xxiv, 76.) The Arabians borrow their account of it\r\nentirely from Dioscorides and Galen. See in particular Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 236); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 591); Avicenna (ii, 2, 345); Ebn\r\nBaithar (ii, 223.)\r\n\r\n\r\nῬάφανος,\r\n\r\nRhaphanus, _Radish_, is heating in the third degree, and desiccative in\r\nthe second. The wild is more powerful. The seeds of both are stronger,\r\nand therefore they discuss hypopion and other lividities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides, like our author, describes two species, of\r\nwhich the former is certainly the _Rhaphanus sativus_, and the other\r\nprobably the _R. maritimus_. Dioscorides gives so long a catalogue of\r\nthe medicinal properties of the former or common radish, that we can\r\nscarcely venture upon an exposition of it. He says of it, that its seed\r\nis emetic, diuretic, and a cleanser of the spleen, when drunk with\r\nvinegar; that it is beneficial in cynanche, and alexipharmic both when\r\ntaken internally and applied externally. Florentinus (Geopon. xii, 22)\r\nand Pliny (H. N. xx, 13) praise the radish as an antidote to poisonous\r\nsubstances and venomous animals. It was much used by the ancients as an\r\nemetic, and for this purpose it was taken before a meal as described by\r\nCelsus. (i, 3.) See also Dioscorides (l. c.) and Pliny (l. c.) Hence\r\nit is frequently prescribed by Nicander, as a remedy in the case of\r\npoisoning, as in that by henbane, and in that by mushrooms. It is also\r\nrecommended in these and similar cases by Scribonius Largus (Compos.\r\n198.) The radish we are confident is the “radicula” of Celsus, who\r\nprescribes it for various purposes, as being laxative, diuretic, and, as\r\nwe formerly stated, emetic. (See Vol. II, 31, &c.) The Arabians attach\r\nmuch importance to this article, but do not supply much information\r\nregarding it but what they acknowledge to be derived from the Greeks. See\r\nSerapion (c. 307); Avicenna (ii, 2, 574); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 571);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 246.) They agree in stating\r\nof it, that taken before other food it renders vomiting easy; and after\r\nfood that it loosens the bowels. All recommend it in cases of poisoning.\r\nThey also prescribe it as a deobstruent in obstructions of the liver and\r\nin jaundice. The radishes, the garden and the wild, retain their ancient\r\ncharacters in the works of our old herbalists, and even in the time of\r\nQuincy they still held a place in our Dispensatory, although, as he says,\r\n“little used in medicine.” (i, 5, 409.)\r\n\r\n\r\nῬῆον,\r\n\r\nRheum (called by some Rhâ), is composed of a terrene, cold, and subtile\r\nsubstance, and of a vaporous, hot, and slightly acrid one. Hence it\r\nrelieves sprains and ruptures, and orthopnœa, and also lividities, by its\r\ndiscutient powers; and by its astringency, spitting of blood, cæliac and\r\ndysenteric affections. By both it cures hepatic complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author manifestly copies from Galen; and whoever will\r\ncarefully compare his account of it with Dioscorides’s chapter on Rhâ,\r\ncannot fail to come to the conclusion that both apply to the same\r\nsubstance, namely, the _Rheum Rhaponticum_. We therefore shall confine\r\nour attention in this place to it, reserving to the Appendix what we\r\nhave got to say on the knowledge possessed by the ancients of the\r\npurgative rhubarb. Dioscorides says of it, that its prevailing power\r\nis astringency, with a certain degree of heat; and he recommends it to\r\nbe taken in a draught for flatulence of the stomach, atony, all kinds\r\nof pain, spasms, diseases of the spleen, liver, and kidneys, tormina,\r\naffections of the chest and bladder, distension of the hypochondria,\r\ndiseases of the uterus, sciatica, hæmoptysis, asthma, hiccough,\r\ndysentery, cæliac affections, intermittents, and the bites of venomous\r\nanimals; also for lividity and leprosy when rubbed in with vinegar,\r\nand for discussing all chronic inflammations in a fomentation. (iii,\r\n2.) Galen’s account of it, as already stated, is exactly the same as\r\nour author’s. Oribasius evidently takes his description of it from\r\nDioscorides; and Aëtius, like our author, as clearly abridges Galen.\r\nThere is no mention of the _Rhâ_ in the works either of Hippocrates or of\r\nCelsus. Pliny’s description of it (he calls it _Rhacoma_) is manifestly\r\nimitated from Dioscorides. (H. N. xxvii, 105.) As already stated, we\r\nshall reserve our exposition of the views of the Arabians to the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬητίναι,\r\n\r\nResinæ, _Resins_, are all calefacient and desiccative; but the turpentine\r\nholds the first place, being discutient, emollient, and attenuating, and\r\nalso detergent, whereby it cures itch; and that of larch is like to it.\r\nThe resin of the pitch-tree, and still more that of the wild pine, are\r\nmore acrid, but neither more discutient nor attractive. Those of the pine\r\nand fir hold an intermediate place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. On the formation of _Resins_ see in particular Theophrastus\r\n(H. P. ix, 2) and Pliny (H. N. xxiv, 22.) Pliny thus sums up his account\r\nof them: “Summæ species duæ; sicca et liquida. Sicca e pinu et picca;\r\nliquida e terebintho, larice, lentisco, cupresso.” The Resina sicca pini\r\nis the _Pix arida_ of the Old London Pharmacopœia, or the _Pix Abietina_\r\nof the New. The Resina liquida laricis is now generally called by the\r\nname of _Venice Turpentine_. The Resina lentisci is well known by the\r\nname of _Mastich_. The _Colophonian rosin_, which is often mentioned in\r\nthis work, is the same as the black fiddler’s rosin. The Cypress rosin\r\ndoes not appear to be much known now. Pliny correctly observes that all\r\nthese resins act on the bowels and the urine. The mode of burning or\r\nroasting resin is described by Dioscorides. (i, 93.) He gives a very\r\ninteresting account of the _resinæ_ in general, which he represents to\r\nbe emollient, calefacient, dissolvent, cleansing, suited for coughs and\r\nconsumptions, in electuaries by themselves or with honey, clearing away\r\nmatters from the chest; and as being diuretic, digestive, laxative of\r\nthe bowels; adapted for the operation on trichiasis (see Book VI, 8),\r\nand for leprosy, with verdigris, copperas, and natron; for purulent ears\r\nwith honey and oil, and for itching of the pudendum. They are mixed,\r\nhe adds, with plasters, liniments, and acopa, and relieve pleuritic\r\npains either when rubbed in or applied by themselves. (i, 91.) All the\r\nother authorities prescribe the resins freely, but none give so full a\r\ndescription of them as Dioscorides. See, however, Celsus (pluries), who\r\nappears to have been particularly fond of them. He recommends turpentine\r\nrosin with butter and honey in phthisis (iii, 22), in dyspnœa (iv, 4,\r\n2), and in various other cases. Our author’s account of them would seem\r\nto be principally taken from Galen. The Arabians, as usual, copy from\r\nthe Greeks, and supply little additional of their own. See Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 242); Serapion (De Simpl. 325); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 580, &c.); Ebn Baithar (pluries.) All the resinæ here\r\ndescribed occur in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia (160, 161.)\r\n\r\n\r\nῬόδα,\r\n\r\nRosæ, _Roses_, are naturally composed of a watery substance, which is\r\nheating, astringent, and bitter. The flowers are still more astringent,\r\nand hence are desiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It comprehended the _R. lutea_, Derlech, _R. arvensis_, and\r\nprobably other species of the _Rosa_, L. Dioscorides gives a careful\r\nexposition of the particular uses of Roses in medicine. He says they are\r\ncooling and astringent. In preparing the flowers for use, he directs the\r\nnails or white portions to be clipped off with a pair of scissors, and\r\nthe remainder compressed and pounded in a shade in a mortar, until they\r\nform into a ball. He recommends them in diseases of the eyes, headache,\r\naffections of the ears, gums, anus, and womb, &c., also when sprinkled\r\nin powder on intertrigo, and as an ingredient in the ointments called\r\n_calliblephara_. (i, 130.) We need not devote time to the exposition\r\nof what the other authorities have written on this subject. See Celsus\r\n(pluries); Galen (De Simpl. viii, et alibi); Avicenna (ii, 2, 568);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 585); Serapion (De Simpl. 108). The Arabians say\r\nof rose-water that it is stomachic and hepatic; and of rose-oil, that it\r\nrelieves inflammation of the stomach and loss of its tone. They recommend\r\nrose-water further both in syncope and in hæmoptysis. Like the Greeks,\r\nthey make it an ingredient in their collyria to the eyes and eyelids.\r\nRhases and Avicenna give particular directions for preparing an ablution\r\nwith roses to remove fetid perspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬοδία ῥίζα,\r\n\r\nRosea radix, is heating in the second degree, and is attenuating and\r\ndiscutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The older commentators and herbalists are by no means\r\nsatisfied that it was the _Rhodiola Rosea_, or rosewood; but the later\r\nauthorities are pretty much agreed upon this point. See Sprengel (in\r\nDioscor. iv, 45) and Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 631). Dioscorides merely\r\nrecommends it along with valerian as an application to the forehead and\r\ntemple in cephalalgia. The other authorities, like Paulus, are content\r\nwith barely stating its general characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬοιὰι,\r\n\r\nMala Punica, _Pomegranates_; the prevailing quality of all the species\r\nof them is an astringent power, by which they act as refrigerants and\r\ndesiccants. But the sweet have this property in a less degree than the\r\nothers. The austere are more refrigerant, but are of a drier nature and\r\nstomachic. Those which are acid are cooling in a greater degree, but have\r\nalso something incisive in their nature. The kernels are more astringent\r\nand desiccative than the juice, but still more so the outer membrane or\r\nrind called _Malicorium_. The flowers called _Cytini_ have similar powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is evidently the _Punica granatum_ L. Woodville says,\r\n“Hippocrati arbor audit σίδη unde cortex fructus σίδιον.” They frequently\r\noccur in the Hippocratic treatises. (De Diæta, ii, &c.) Cytini is\r\ngenerally put for the flowers of the cultivated pomegranate, and\r\nbalaustia for those of the wild. The bark of the root called malicorium\r\nby Celsus was much used. Pliny, like the medical authorities, speaks of\r\nthem all as being excellent astringents. He recommends them particularly\r\nin cæliac affections and hæmoptysis. (H. N. xxiii, 57.) The most\r\ninteresting of the ancient authorities on this head is Dioscorides, who\r\nsays of the sweet pomegranate that it engenders heat and flatulence in\r\nthe stomach, and hence is unsuitable in fevers; and of the acid, that\r\nit relieves ardor of the stomach, and is more astringent and diuretic,\r\nbeing unsavoury and styptic; that the vinous has an intermediate\r\nnature; that the kernel of the acid pomegranate, when dried in the\r\nsun and sprinkled on food and boiled with it, restrains fluxes of the\r\nstomach and bowels; that when macerated in rain-water and drunk, it is\r\nbeneficial in hæmoptysis, and in a hip-bath is suitable in dysentery\r\nand other fluxes; and that the expressed juice of the kernels, when\r\nboiled and mixed with honey, is suitable to ulcers in the mouth, on the\r\npudendum and anus; for pterygia on the fingers, spreading ulcers, fungus,\r\nearache, and complaints in the nose, and more especially those of the\r\nacid pomegranate. (i, 141.) He also treats separately of the flowers and\r\nthe bark, recommending the latter as an anthelminthic medicine. Galen\r\nand the other Greek authorities treat of the pomegranate in nearly the\r\nsame words as Paulus. It would exceed our limits to give a notice of the\r\nvarious cases in which Celsus prescribes this medicine. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that he calls it stomachic, cooling, and styptic, and recommends the\r\nflowers, the bark, and the root for these and various other purposes. For\r\nthe Arabians see Avicenna (ii, 2, 109, 313); Serapion (De Simpl. 129);\r\nRhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 443); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar\r\n(i, 499). One of Serapion’s authorities, Ruffus, recommends the acid\r\npomegranate in cardiac disease, and another, Aben Mesue, in cholera and\r\nsyncope, which attends it. All praise it as a stomachic, more especially\r\nin the loss of appetite attending pregnancy, and in vomiting. Rhases and\r\nAvicenna say that pomegranate wine relieves intoxication. Both the sweet\r\nand the acid are held to be diuretic, but especially the latter. The\r\nflesh of the sweet purges yellow bile and strengthens the stomach. They\r\nall represent the rind as being anthelminthic. On this use of it, see\r\nBook IV, 58, and Pereira (Mat. Med. 1101). It has been a question, by the\r\nway, whether the malicorium _or_ σίδιον of the Greeks, was the rind of\r\nthe fruit or the bark of the root. We used to think it the former, but\r\nthe examination of a passage in Avicenna (l. c.) has satisfied us that\r\nthe latter was also sometimes included. In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\nboth the bark of the root and the rind of the fruit are described, the\r\nterm σίδιον being restricted to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nῬοῦς βυρσοδεψικὴ,\r\n\r\nRhus Coriaria, _Sumach_; the fruit and juice of it come principally to be\r\nused by physicians, being considerably astringent and desiccative of the\r\nthird order, but detergent of the second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Rhus Coriaria_, or _Elm-leaved Sumach_. This\r\nalso was much used as an astringent. Pliny briefly says of it, “vim\r\nhabet astringendi refrigerandique.” The Arabian writers on husbandry\r\nmention that in times of famine bread was sometimes made from sumach.\r\nDioscorides says of it that its leaves are astringent, being applicable\r\nin the same cases as acacia. He recommends it in dysentery when given\r\nby the mouth, in a lavement and hip-bath, as an injection in cases of\r\npurulent discharges from the ears, and for many other practical purposes.\r\nHe concludes with mentioning that it bears a gum which is put into the\r\nholes of carious teeth to relieve pain. (i, 147.) Celsus notices it but\r\nonce, and then as an application to aphthous ulcerations of the mouth.\r\n(vi, 11.) It is mentioned as an astringent medicine and condiment in the\r\nHippocratic treatises. (De Mulieb. and de Liquid. usu.) Galen, and the\r\nother Greek authorities after him, merely state its general properties as\r\na medicine. The Arabians treat of it under the name of sumach, which it\r\nstill retains. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 635); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i. 695);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 225); Ebn Baithar (ii, 46, 163.)\r\n\r\n\r\nῬύπος,\r\n\r\nThe Sordes, from copper statues or vessels, in which a considerable\r\nquantity of oil has been kept, having also some verdigris, is discutient,\r\nmoderately desiccative and emollient. It therefore discusses unconcocted\r\nphymata. But the sordes in the palestra (which some call paton), has been\r\ndescribed under the head of sweat. The sordes in the ears is said to cure\r\nwhitlows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel gives a long dissertation on the sordes palestræ.\r\n(Ad Dioscor. i, 36.) Suffice it to say in this place that it was\r\ncollected from the bodies of the wrestlers in the palestra, and consisted\r\nof oil, sweat, dust, and any powder used for cleansing the skin.\r\nSprengel, from a passage in the works of Theophrastus (H. P. v, 9),\r\ninfers that the sordes gymnasiorum were collected from statues made of\r\ncedar, but he appears to have overlooked the account of it given by our\r\nauthor, from which it must be obvious that it was collected from statues\r\nof copper, or rather of bronze. The sordes balneorum, which is treated of\r\nby Dioscorides (i, 34), will be readily understood from the description\r\nwhich we have given in another place (Vol. I, 68), of the preparatory\r\nprocess which the bathers went through before going into the bath. It\r\nmust have consisted then of human sweat and other impurities extracted\r\nfrom the skin, mixed up with soda, flour of beans, or any other substance\r\nused in cleansing the skin by means of the comb (strigil.) Dioscorides\r\nsays it is heating, emollient, and discutient, and is used as a liniment\r\nto fissures and condylomata. These articles are treated of by most of\r\nthe other authorities. On the sordes palestræ, see in particular Galen.\r\n(T. ii, 136, ed. Basil.) For the Arabians see Avicenna (ii, 2, 648), and\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 169).\r\n\r\n\r\nΣαγαπηνὸν,\r\n\r\nSagapenum, _Sagapen_, is the juice of a sort of ferula, being hot and\r\nattenuate. It is also somewhat detergent, so as to agree with cicatrices\r\nin the eyes and suffusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It has never been disputed, as far as we are aware, that the\r\nancient sagapenum was the same substance as the modern. However, it is\r\nnot even yet well ascertained by what tree it is furnished, but it is\r\ngenerally supposed to be either the _Ferula Persica_ or _F. Szowitsiana_.\r\nSee Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 776). We know no more about it, then, at the\r\npresent day than what was known of it by Dioscorides, who describes it\r\nas being the juice of a plant resembling the ferula, having a smell\r\nintermediate between the juice of silphium (assafœtida) and galbanum.\r\nHe recommends it for various medicinal purposes; for affections of the\r\nchest, epilepsy, hysterical convulsions, for promoting menstruation, and\r\ndestroying the fœtus in utero; as an alexipharmic, and for discussing\r\nfilms on the eyes, cataracts, &c. (iii, 85.) Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius\r\ngive much the same account of it as our author. Galen says it is the\r\njuice of a certain ferula resembling panax. (De Antid. i.) It occurs\r\nin the works of Celsus as an ingredient in the famous antidote of\r\nMithridates, and also as an ingredient in one of his collyria. (vi, 6,\r\n24.) For the Arabians see Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n629); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 631); Serapion (192); Ebn Baithar (ii,\r\n37.) They recommend it in a good many more cases than the Greeks do. For\r\nexample, they all say that it is a gentle laxative. Modern authorities,\r\nhowever, have denied that it is possessed of this property. See Hill\r\n(Mat. Med.) Rutty, notwithstanding, seems to agree with the ancients.\r\n(Mat. Med. 447.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣαλαμάνδρα,\r\n\r\nSalamandra, _Salamander_; when burnt its ashes are by some mixed with\r\ncorrosive medicines and remedies for lepra and scabies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Salamandra terrestris_. The story of the\r\nsalamander’s being proof against the operation of fire is mentioned by\r\nNicander, Aristotle, and Theophrastus; but the truth of it is questioned\r\nby Dioscorides. Sprengel remarks that the real fact is, that the\r\nsalamander is a black ugly lizard, from whose body a cold viscid fluid is\r\nsecreted, which may be capable of extinguishing a small coal. Agricola\r\nsays, its body is as cold as ice, and therefore capable of extinguishing\r\na coal. M. l’Abbé Bonnaterre likewise states that the humour which it\r\nsecretes from its body prevents the operation of coals from affecting\r\nit for a short time. (Encycl. Méthod.) Our author borrows his medicinal\r\ncharacter of the salamander from Dioscorides, who says it is possessed of\r\nseptic, ulcerative, and calefacient powers, like cantharides. (ii. 67.)\r\nNone of the other authorities give any additional information of much\r\ninterest under this head. The Arabians would appear not to have included\r\nit in their Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣάμψυχον,\r\n\r\nSampsuchum (a species of marjoram), is calefacient and desiccative in the\r\nthird degree. It also consists of subtile parts, and is discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Although Galen and our author distinguish the _Amaracus_\r\nfrom the _Sampsuchus_, there seems no reason to doubt their identity.\r\nSee Needham (Ad Geopon. xi, 27); the Synonymes of Dioscor. (iii, 41);\r\nand Sprengel (ibid.) Dioscorides describes it (_Origanum marjorana_)\r\nminutely, and says its decoction is drunk with advantage in cases of\r\ndropsy, dysuria, and tormina; that its dried leaves, in a cataplasm with\r\nhoney, remove suggillations; and that in a pessary it is emmenagogue.\r\nHe also recommends it as an external application to the stings of\r\nscorpions, sprains, œdematous swellings, inflammations of the eyes, and\r\nas a calefacient ingredient in acopa and malagmata. (Ibid.) Galen and the\r\nother Greek authorities treat of it in general terms. For the Arabians,\r\nsee Avicenna (ii, 2, 466); Serapion (c. 286); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n439). They recommend it in the same cases as the Greeks; and also in\r\nhemicrania, vertigo, earache, in embrocations and injections. They also\r\nspeak well of the oil of it as an application in cases of paralysis.\r\nThe “Thymus Cyprius” of Celsus is set down by C. Bauhin as being the\r\n_Thymus mastichius_; but whether it be any other than the marjoram seems\r\ndoubtful, although Celsus certainly mentions them as distinct substances.\r\n(v, 11.) Compare our account of this article with what Quincy says of the\r\nmarjoram in the ‘Complete English Dispensatory’ (60.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣανδαράχη,\r\n\r\nSandaracha, _Red Arsenic_, is possessed of caustic powers like orpiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That it was the sub-species of sulphuret of arsenic, called\r\nrealgar, namely, “the red orpiment” of Jameson, can admit of no question.\r\nIn our Appendix to this section, we shall have something to say relative\r\nto the sandaracha of the Arabians. Dioscorides says it has the same\r\ngeneral powers as arsenic (yellow orpiment), and recommends it externally\r\nin alopecia, leprosy, phthiriasis, hard boils, ulcers in the nose and\r\nmouth, other exanthemata and condylomata; and also internally in cases\r\nof empyema with mulse; in fumigations with resin in chronic cough, when\r\nits steam is inhaled into the mouth by means of a syphon. He concludes\r\nby saying of it, that in a linctus with honey it clears the voice, and\r\nalong with dry pitch makes an excellent pill for asthmatics. (v, 121.)\r\nGalen, Aëtius, and Oribasius give but a very brief and general account of\r\nit. Celsus places it in his lists of cleansing and corroding substances\r\n(v, 5, 6), and often prescribes it as a septic and caustic application.\r\nAvicenna treats of the white, the yellow, and the red arsenic in the same\r\nchapter. What he says of the last, or realgar, is taken from Dioscorides.\r\n(ii, 2, 48.) Serapion also treats of the yellow and red arsenic in the\r\nsame chapter, and merely gives extracts under this head from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. See further Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 610); Averrhoes (Collig.\r\nv, 43); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 48, 503); Ebn Baithar (i, 527.) The last\r\nof these gives an interesting description of three kinds of arsenic,\r\nnamely, the yellow, the red, and the white. The red of course is the\r\narticle now under consideration. He says of the yellow and red, that when\r\ncalcined they become white, and when melted with a certain red ore lose\r\ntheir disagreeable smell. The white is said to be a mortal poison. The\r\nyellow and the red he recommends in phagedænic sores of the mouth and\r\nnose and elsewhere, and as an inhalation in asthma and orthopnœa.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣάνδυξ,\r\n\r\nSandyx, or Siricon, consists of subtile parts, and has desiccative\r\npowers, but not heating.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen says that when ceruse is burnt, that is to say,\r\ncalcined, it becomes sandyx. (De Simpl. ix.) See also Pliny (H. N.\r\nxxxv, 23.) He calls it burnt ceruse mixed with an equal proportion of\r\nrubrica. See also Alston and Sprengel. Dioscorides treats of it under the\r\nsame head as ceruse, and describes the process by which the latter is\r\nconverted into sandyx. The Arabian authorities, in like manner, treat of\r\nit along with ceruse. See Serapion (c. 378); Avicenna (ii, 2, 117.) From\r\nwhat has been said, then, it will be readily seen that it was merely a\r\npeculiar preparation of ceruse.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣαπρότης ξύλων,\r\n\r\nCaries lignorum, _Carious Wood_, and especially that of the elm, cleanses\r\nand fills humid ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the _Caries_ or _Rot_ of wood is\r\ntaken from Dioscorides, who recommends it in the same cases as Carbo\r\nligni is now applied, namely, to ulcers, but more especially spreading\r\nulcers. (i, 143.) It is the Lignorum marcor of the Arabians, who\r\nrecommend it in the same cases as the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 617);\r\nSerapion (c. 48.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣάπων,\r\n\r\nSapo, _Soap_, is possessed of detergent powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The first author, we believe, who makes mention of _Soap_ is\r\nPliny. He calls it an invention of the Gauls. It is made, he says, of\r\nsuet and ashes. (H. N. xxviii, 51.) Aretæus likewise calls it a Gallic\r\ncomposition, prepared from soda, and used for cleansing clothes. He\r\nrecommends it as an application to the skin in elephantiasis. (De Curat.\r\nMorb. Chron. ii, 13.) Serapion praises it as an application to abscesses.\r\nThe only Greek authority which he quotes under this head is Paulus.\r\n(De Simpl. 368.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 650); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\ni, 609, ii, 628); and Ebn Baithar (ii, 119.) One of Baithar’s Arabian\r\nauthorities commends soap in leprosy and scabies; also in favus and the\r\ncutaneous diseases of the scalp. Ebn Baithar further gives a very curious\r\naccount of the process of dyeing the beard by means of a mixture of\r\nsoap and sandyx. This was a very ancient use of soap, and is frequently\r\nalluded to by the classical authors. (Ovid. Ars. Amand. iii, 163.) This\r\nsubject is treated of very ingeniously by Beckmann in his ‘History of\r\nInventions.’ The author, however, is mistaken in supposing that there\r\nis no mention of soap in the works of Galen, with the exception of that\r\nwork ‘De Simplicibus,’ universally admitted to be spurious, whereas Galen\r\nfrequently makes mention of it in works about the authenticity of which\r\nthere has never been any question. As for example, (Meth. Med. viii); (De\r\nComp. med. sec. loc. T. ii, 225.) In the latter passage he makes distinct\r\nmention of Gallic soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣαρκοκόλλα,\r\n\r\nSarcocolla, is the tear of a Persian tree, being emplastic and\r\ndesiccative without pungency, and therefore it agglutinates wounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is not, we presume, the slightest reason to doubt\r\nthat the ancient Sarcocol was the same as the modern, namely, the gum\r\nof the _Penæa Sarcocolla_. Dioscorides mentions only its external use\r\nin agglutinating wounds and restraining defluxions on the eyes. (iii,\r\n89.) The Greeks confined the use of it to external applications; but\r\nthe Arabians sometimes administered it internally as a purge. Thus\r\nSerapion, Rhases, and Avicenna say that it purges crude humours and gross\r\nphlegm, especially from the joints. They recommend it with honey as an\r\napplication in diseases of the ear. They say it corrodes putrid flesh,\r\nand heals recent wounds, and restores parts that are distorted. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 592); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 617); Serapion (c. 15.)\r\nEven as late as the time of Dr. Lewis the sarcocol was still retained in\r\nour English Dispensatory with the characters assigned to it by the Greeks\r\nand Arabians. Of late years it has been entirely omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣαρξιφαγὲς,\r\n\r\nSaxifraga, _Saxifrage_, is diuretic and lithontriptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There has been great diversity of opinion respecting it,\r\nas Sprengel has shown in a very learned dissertation. (Ad Dioscor. iv,\r\n15.) It is, therefore, by no means certain that it is the _Pimpinella\r\nSaxifraga_, but we incline to this opinion. Apuleius says that it is\r\nlithontriptic, and indeed it appears to have derived its name from\r\nthis real or supposed property. The chapter of Dioscorides on it is of\r\ndoubtful authenticity. It is not contained in Galen’s work on Simples. We\r\ndoubt also if it is to be found in the works of the Arabians. Not many\r\nyears ago the Burnet saxifrage held a place in the Dispensatory with\r\nthe character of possessing the virtues ascribed to this article by the\r\nancients. See Quincy (147.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣατύριον,\r\n\r\nSatyrion, or Trifolium, is of a humid and hot temperament, and flatulent;\r\nhence it is a provocative to venery. Some say that it cures opisthotonos\r\nwhen drunk with austere wine; but Galen, in his treatise ‘De Theriaca,’\r\nsays, that the trifolium, which is like the hyacinth, when it becomes\r\npregnant with the spring, has a seed like the wild cnicus, and that when\r\nthe decoction of it is poured upon the bite of the phalangium or viper\r\nit cures the same; but when applied to a sound part, he says, that it\r\ninduces an affection similar to that of those who have been bitten by one\r\nof those creatures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is very difficult to determine; and it would be useless\r\nto mention the variety of conjectures which have been advanced\r\nrespecting it. Sprengel inclines to think that it was a species of\r\ntulip, and suggests that it probably was the _Tulipa Gesneriana_. This\r\nis the species which Dioscorides further distinguishes by the name\r\nof _Trifolium_. The other named by him _Erythronium_ is probably the\r\n_Erythronium Dens Canis_. What confirms this conjecture very much is, the\r\ncircumstance that the _Dens Canis_ is still reputed to be aphrodisiac,\r\nas the _Erythronium_ is reported to be by Dioscorides. (iii, 134.) See\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 204.) Galen gives nearly the same account of it as\r\nour author. The Arabians scarcely appear to distinguish it properly from\r\nthe orchis, but otherwise they give the same characters of these plants\r\nas the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 706, 707); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n7, 14.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣάυρα,\r\n\r\nLacerta, _the Lizard_; the liver and head have been treated of in their\r\nproper places. When an entire one has been cut in pieces and applied, it\r\ncures persons bitten by scorpions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It seems not unlikely that it may have been the _Lacerta\r\nGecko_. See the translation of Ebn Baithar by Sontheimer (ii, 3), where\r\nthe chapter of Dioscorides on the Saura, is arranged under this head,\r\nalong with another to the same effect from Avicenna. Dioscorides, and\r\nindeed all the authorities who treat of it, recommend it for the bites of\r\nscorpions. Pliny recommends it in complaints of the eyes. (H. N. xxix,\r\n38.) The Arabians recommend it in the same cases as the Greeks, and also\r\nsay of it, that its liver soothes the pains of toothache, and that its\r\nurine and blood are useful in the ruptures of children. See Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 639.) In the East it is still used medicinally. Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii,\r\n276.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣέλινον,\r\n\r\nApium, _Parsley_, is hot to such a degree that it promotes the urinary\r\nand menstrual discharges. It is also carminative and especially the seed\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems little or no doubt that it is the Common\r\nParsley, namely, _Apium petroselinum_, which long held a place in our\r\nDispensatory, and retained in it its ancient characters. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it in a great many cases; for inflammations of the eyes in\r\ncataplasms; for heat of the stomach; as a diuretic and antidote to\r\nvenomous animals; and for various other medicinal purposes. (iii, 77.)\r\nGalen and the other Greek authorities merely state its virtues in general\r\nterms. The Arabians treat of it under Apium, not distinguishing it very\r\naccurately from its congeners. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 55); Serapion (c.\r\n290); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 69.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣερὶς,\r\n\r\nSeris, _Endive_, is a bitterish potherb, being considerably refrigerant\r\nand diluent. It has also some astringency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It comprehends the _Cichorium Intybus_ and the _C. Endivia_.\r\nIt is now known by the names of the Endive, or Garden Succory. We have\r\ntreated of it as an article of food in the First Book, and as a medicine\r\nit is not deserving of much notice, after what we have said of its\r\ncongener under the head of _Cichorium_. It was generally held to be a\r\ngood hepatic medicine. See Dioscorides (ii, 125); Galen (De Simpl.);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 229); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i. 266.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣέριφον,\r\n\r\nSeriphon, is heating in the second degree, but desiccative in the first,\r\nbeing like wormwood, only it is less astringent and more calefacient than\r\nit. It is also anthelminthic, and to a considerable degree bad for the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From Dioscorides’s description we may confidently refer it\r\nto the _Artemisia maritima_, Angl., _Drooping-flowered Sea Wormwood_.\r\nDioscorides gives it exactly the same characters as our author, namely,\r\nthat of being bitterish, astringent, and a good vermifuge. (iii, 24.)\r\nGalen says of it, that it is more powerfully anthelminthic than the\r\nabsinthium. The Arabians treat of it along with the absinthium. It is\r\nnot to be found in the works of Hippocrates and Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣέσελι,\r\n\r\nSeseli, _Hard Meadow Saxifrage_ (?) or _Hartwort_; the root, and more\r\nespecially the fruit, is considerably heating with tenuity of parts, and\r\nis also diuretic. It agrees with epilepsy and orthopnœa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author, it will be remarked, gives only one species of\r\nSeseli, which there can be no doubt is the same as the Seseli Massiliense\r\nof Dioscorides (iii, 53), about which, notwithstanding its being long\r\nheld to be an important article in the Mat. Med., there is considerable\r\ndifference of opinion. We, for reasons which we have not room to state,\r\nwere inclined to refer it to the Laserpitium Siler; but the authority of\r\nClusius, Lewis, and Sprengel has determined us to recognise it as the\r\n_Seseli tortuosum_. The other two species we are quite satisfied are the\r\n_Bupleurum fruticosum_ and _Ligusticum Peloponnesiacum_. Compare Sprengel\r\nad Dioscor. (l. c.) with Gray (Suppl. to the Pharm. 80.) Dioscorides\r\nrepresents the first species as being a diuretic, expectorant, and\r\nuterine medicine. He says it was given not only to women, but to goats\r\nand other animals to assist parturition. Of the other two species, he\r\nmerely says that they are possessed of the same virtues. Galen, Aëtius,\r\nand Oribasius merely give the general characters of the first species, in\r\nnearly the same terms as our author. This, beyond dispute, is the “Sil”\r\nof Apicius (c. 34), and of Celsus (v, 23.) The latter merely mentions it\r\nas an ingredient in the celebrated antidote of Mithridates. (Ibid.) We\r\ncan find little or no additional information respecting it in the works\r\nof the Arabians. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 626); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n654); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Serapion (De Simpl. 190.) Aben Mesuai,\r\none of Serapion’s authorities, thus sums up its characters: it is hot\r\nand dry in the end of the second degree; cuts and dissolves viscid and\r\ncongealed phlegm, and therefore opens all the pores and passages which\r\nare shut up; provokes urine and the menstrua; and is beneficial in asthma\r\nand all cold pituitous ailments. The seeds of seseli held a place in our\r\nDispensatory as late as the times of Quincy (158), and of Lewis (ii,\r\n366.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣηπία,\r\n\r\nSepia, _the Cuttlefish_; its shell has powers like those of an oyster,\r\nbut is attenuant and more detergent; hence, if burnt, it attenuates\r\npterygium along with fossil salts. When unburnt it clears away sycosis\r\nwhen rubbed upon the part, and proves detergent to the skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Sepia Loligo_, L. We need scarcely mention that\r\nthe shells of fishes consist principally of lime. As represented by the\r\nancients, therefore, they form a detergent application to the skin. All\r\nthe authorities recommend it in nearly the same cases, namely, as an\r\ningredient in stimulant collyria, and in obstinate cutaneous diseases,\r\nand as a dentifrice. See Dioscorides (ii, 23); Galen (De Simpl.); Celsus\r\n(v, 29); Aëtius (ii, 190.) Aëtius gives the fullest account of this\r\narticle. (l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣησαμοειδὲς,\r\n\r\nSesamoides; the seed of the white species heats, is detergent, and\r\nprocures the rupture of abscesses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This article, which occurs in the Hippocratic treatises,\r\nand of which two species, the great and the small, are described by\r\nDioscorides, has been the subject of much controversy. See Parkinson,\r\nSprengel, and Dierbach. We are willing to acquiesce in Sprengel’s\r\ndecision regarding them, namely, that they are the _Reseda Mediterranea_\r\nand _canescens_. It appears that they were used principally in\r\ncombination with hellebore, and that the one evacuated upwards, and the\r\nother downwards. (Dioscor. iv, 150, 151.) Ruffus treats only of the\r\nsmall, which he represents to be cholagogue and phlegmagogue, when its\r\nseed is taken to the amount of an acetabulum. (De Med. Purg.) It does\r\nnot occur in the works of Celsus, and does not seem to have been much\r\nin repute. Galen gives nearly the same account of it as Dioscorides. We\r\nhave not found it in the works of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn\r\nBaithar, one of whose Arabian authorities speaks of its being used in\r\nparalysis. (i, 252.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣήσαμον,\r\n\r\nSesamum, _Oily-grain_, is glutinous and fatty in no small degree; hence\r\nit is emplastic, emollient, and moderately calefacient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. All the authorities acknowledge it as the _Sesamum\r\norientale_. Pliny ranks it among the summer corn of India. He says,\r\nthat an oil is procured from it, and that it forms a good application\r\nto burns. (H. N. xviii, 22; xxii, 64.) This account of it in fact is\r\ncondensed from Dioscorides, who recommends both the plant and the oil\r\nin various external complaints, including burns, inflammations of the\r\neyes, the bites of venomous animals, &c. (i, 41, ii, 121); Celsus ranks\r\nit among his emollients, and recommends it as an hepatic. (iv, 8.)\r\nGalen and Aëtius give nearly the same account of it as our author. The\r\nArabians treat of it at great length, both as an article of food and of\r\nmedicine. See Serapion (De Simpl. 86); Avicenna (ii, 2, 642); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 650); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (i, 254.)\r\nThey all recommend it for the same purposes as the Greeks, and as a good\r\napplication to fissures and suggillations.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣῆψ,\r\n\r\nSeps (which some have called the _Chalcidic Lizard_), when drunk in wine\r\ncures those who have been bitten by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is called ζύγνις by Aristotle. (H. A. viii, 23), and hence\r\nit has got the name of _Zygnis tridactyla_. Solinus says of it, “Ictus\r\nsepium putredo sequitur.” (Polyhistor. c. 40.) Our author’s account of\r\nit is taken literally from Dioscorides. (ii, 72.) It is briefly noticed\r\nby Aëtius, but we have not found it treated of by any of the Arabian\r\nauthorities on the Mat. Med. except Ebn Baithar, who merely gives an\r\nextract from Dioscorides under this head. (ii, 199.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίαλον,\r\n\r\nSaliva; that of men in a fasting state is particularly discutient and\r\ndetergent; it therefore clears away the lichen of children when the parts\r\nare anointed with it. It also concocts furunculus when applied along with\r\nwheat that has been masticated in it. It removes hypopion. It is likewise\r\nmost destructive to those venomous animals which prove fatal to men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _Saliva_\r\nis abridged from Galen, who gives a very elaborate disquisition on\r\nthe virtues of it. Pliny’s statement is fuller, but contains many\r\nsuperstitious notions. (H. N. xxviii, 71.) Serapion copies from Galen.\r\n(c. 447.) It was principally as an application to cutaneous eruptions\r\nand sores that the ancient physicians made use of saliva, and it would\r\nappear to be not ill adapted to that purpose. Dr. Thomson, in his work on\r\nChemistry, has the following remarks on it: “Saliva has a great affinity\r\nfor oxygen, absorbs it readily from the air, and gives it out again to\r\nother bodies; hence, in all probability, the reason that saliva is a\r\nuseful application to sores of the skin. Dogs and several other animals\r\nhave recourse to this remedy, and with much advantage.” (Book v, c. ii,\r\nsect. 13.) Galen contends strongly that human saliva is destructive\r\nto animals, and appeals to Nicander in confirmation of this venomous\r\nopinion. He further mentions having seen an instance of a scorpion being\r\nkilled by human saliva alone. All the Arabian authorities ascribe this\r\nvirtue to it. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 599, 613); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 602); Ebn Baithar (i, 144.) These all, in fact, do little more\r\nthan copy from Galen. Redi, in opposition to all the ancient authorities,\r\ndenies that human saliva is destructive to the viper. “Non nostrum inter\r\neos tantam componere litem!”\r\n\r\n\r\nΣιδηρίτις,\r\n\r\nSideritis, _Ironwort_, the Heraclean, called also Helxine, has been\r\ntreated of. The Achillean Sideritis is like to it, but more astringent.\r\nHence it agrees with fluxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is one of the articles in the ancient Materia Medica\r\nwhich has never been satisfactorily determined. See Parkinson (Theatre\r\nof Plants, pluries) and Sprengel (Ad Dioscor.) The first species of\r\nDioscorides, namely, the Herculia, is the same as the Helxine of\r\nour author, and has been already treated of. The other two we would\r\nhesitatingly set down as the _Sanguisorba officinalis_ and _Geranium\r\nRobertianum_. The reputation which the latter has enjoyed in modern\r\ntimes, as a vulnerary, appears to us strongly confirmatory of the opinion\r\nthat it was one of the siderites of the ancients. See Hill (Mat. Med.\r\n407) and Lewis (Mat. Med. i, 464.) So striking and important an article\r\nas the Robertianum is not likely to have escaped the observation of the\r\nGreek and Arabian Rhizotomi. Apuleius says that the Latins call it\r\nFerraria. Dioscorides commends it as a vulnerary medicine. Galen does the\r\nsame, and further praises it as an astringent application in cases of\r\nhemorrhage, dysentery, and female flux. We find difficulty in discovering\r\ntraces of it in the works of the Arabians, although we incline to the\r\nbelief that they have not entirely overlooked it. The burnet is still\r\ncultivated in gardens. See Loudon (Encycl. of Garden. 744.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίδηρος,\r\n\r\nFerrum, _Iron_; when frequently extinguished in water it imparts a\r\nconsiderably desiccative power to it. When drunk, therefore, it agrees\r\nwith affections of the spleen. But, if extinguished in wine, it is useful\r\nin cæliac and dysenteric affections, cholera, and resolution of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of _Iron_ is mostly taken from\r\nDioscorides. He says the ærugo ferri astringes, and hence it stops the\r\nfemale flux in pessaries, and when drunk prevents impregnation; when\r\nrubbed in along with vinegar it cures erysipelas and exanthema; it\r\nis very useful for whitlow, pterygia, asperities of the eyelids, and\r\ncondylomata; it strengthens the gums, is a useful liniment in gout, and\r\nthickens the hairs in alopecia; and he concludes with what our author\r\nsays of the virtues of water in which heated iron has been extinguished.\r\n(v, 93.) Pliny, in like manner, says of it: “Calefit ferro candente\r\naqua, in multis vitiis, privatim vero dysentericis.” (H. N. xxxiv, 44.)\r\nCelsus commends chalybeate water in enlargement of the spleen. (iv, 9.)\r\nCælius Aurelianus mentions it among the remedies for epilepsy. (Chron.\r\ni, 4.) Scribonius Largus calls it a wonderful remedy for diseases of the\r\nbladder. (Comp. 146.) The Arabians borrow their account of the ærugo\r\nferri almost entirely from Dioscorides. See Serapion (De Simpl. 403);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 247); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 295.) They give nothing\r\noriginal under the present head. The στόμωμα, according to Pollux, is\r\nhard iron, that is to say, steel. The scales or rust of the edges of\r\nweapons made of steel were much used by the ancient physicians, both\r\ninternally and externally, as astringents and styptics. See a full\r\naccount of their medicinal properties in Pliny. (H. N. xxxiv, 66.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣικύος,\r\n\r\nCucumis, _the Cucumber_; the esculent, when green, is cooling and diluent\r\nin the second degree; and the flesh of it soothes hot inflammations. The\r\nseed is detergent and incisive, promotes the discharge of urine, and\r\nclears the body. But when dried, both the seed and root prove desiccative\r\nin the first order, and more detergent. The juice of the fruit of the\r\nwild cucumber is called _Elaterium_. That of the root and leaves is\r\nlike to elaterium, but weaker. The root is detergent, discutient, and\r\nemollient, but the juice is desiccative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have already stated more than once that the Σ. of the\r\nGreeks or _Cucumis_ of the Latins was applied to several species of the\r\nsummer fruits. Our author, we presume, applies it here to the _Cucumis\r\nsativus_. His account of its medicinal qualities is abridged from Galen.\r\nDioscorides calls the seed of the Cucumis sativus moderately diuretic,\r\nalong with must answering well in ulcerations of the bladder, and says\r\nthat its leaves, in a cataplasm with wine, are useful in the bites of\r\ndogs. The Arabians give the same account of it, but evidently mix it up\r\nwith the characters of the gourd, as given by their Grecian masters; it\r\nis, therefore, almost impossible to discover when they are treating of\r\nthe one and when of the other. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 89); Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 143); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 260.) The seeds\r\nof the cucumber long held a place in our modern Dispensatories, and were\r\nranked as one of the greater cold seeds. See Quincy (107) and Lewis (Mat.\r\nMed. i, 380.) _Elaterium_, or the fruit of the wild cucumber, was much\r\nused by the ancient physicians from Hippocrates downwards. Theophrastus\r\nand Pliny affirm that it is the most durable of all medicines, and that\r\nit had actually been known to retain its virtues for two hundred years.\r\nIt was given internally as a hydragogue, and applied externally in cases\r\nof lichen, scabies, impetigo, and the like. Of it, however, we have\r\ntreated fully under _elaterium_, as a medicine in this section, and as\r\na poison in Book V (64.) Dioscorides gives an account of the virtues of\r\nits leaves and roots, the juice of which he recommends as an external\r\napplication in leprosy and other cutaneous diseases, and as an hydragogue\r\nand cholagogue in dropsy. Galen treats of them in more general terms,\r\nlike our author. Ruffus says its root is suitable to dropsical cases. It\r\nis the Cucumis sylvestris, _seu_ asininus, of the Arabians, who treat of\r\nall parts of it at great length. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 177); Serapion (c.\r\n204); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 143); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 54, 567); Ebn Baithar (ii, 210.) One of Rhases’s authorities\r\nsays, that in a pessary the wild cucumber kills the fœtus. Another of\r\nthem says an external application of it to the head is of great use in\r\nheadaches. Haly Abbas recommends it as a purge in paralysis and colic.\r\nOne of Serapion’s authorities is an Arabian, named by him Habix, who\r\ngives a very interesting account of the wild cucumber, which he describes\r\nas being more sharp and bitter than the wild gourd.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίλλυβον,\r\n\r\nSillybum, is a thorny shrub, like the white chamæleon, but edible. The\r\njuice of the root of it, when drunk with honeyed water to the amount of a\r\ndrachm, is emetic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Matthiolus admits that it was totally unknown to him. Is it\r\nnot the Carduus Mariæ, or _Common Milk-thistle_? See Alston (Lectures)\r\nand Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 976.) Sprengel joins Lobelius in\r\nacknowledging it as the _Sillybum marianum_, Gaertn. Harduin makes it to\r\nbe the _Cardo Marie_ of the Italians. (Ad Plin. xxxvi, 25.) Pliny says\r\nof it, that its concrete juice evacuates bile. (H. N. xxvi, 25.) Our\r\nauthor’s character of it is taken from Dioscorides (iv, 156.) None of the\r\nother authorities give any more distinct description either of the plant\r\nitself or of its virtues. Galen has omitted it altogether, and we have\r\nnot been able to find it in the works of the Arabians, unless it be the\r\nplant treated of by Serapion. (c. 305.) Though this article (supposing it\r\nactually to be the _Carduus Marianus_) has long ceased to hold a place in\r\nour Dispensatory, it would appear that it is not wholly unknown to the\r\nshops of the apothecaries. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 64.) An eminent\r\nauthority of his day, Crantz, describes the Carduus Mariæ as being\r\nsudorific, diuretic, and deobstruent, and a remedy to ill-conditioned\r\nsores. (Mat. Med. ii, 157.) It must be admitted that this character does\r\nnot well agree with that of the _Sillybum_ as given by Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίλουρος,\r\n\r\nSilurus, _the Shad-fish_, pickled and eaten, clears the trachea when in a\r\nhumid state. In a cataplasm it extracts sharp weapons of wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Artedi calls it, Silurus cirris quatuor in mento,—γλανὶς\r\n(Aristot.); glanus et glanis (Plin.); Angl. “_the Sheat-fish_” (Descr.\r\nspec. pisc.) In the Linnæan arrangement it is called _Silurus glanis_.\r\nWe have treated of it as an article of food in Book I. Dioscorides\r\nrecommends it as a medicine in the same cases as our author, and also\r\nsays of it that its brine is useful in dysenteric affections as a\r\nhip-bath, by determining the defluxion to the surface, and that in\r\nclysters it cures sciatica. (ii, 29.) We have not been able to find\r\nany account of it in the works of the Arabians, with the exception of\r\nEbn Baithar, who gives a pretty full account of it from both Greek and\r\nArabian authorities. (i, 245.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣιλφὴ,\r\n\r\nBlatta Pistrina, or the moth found in bakers’ shops, the entrails of\r\nwhich, when boiled and pounded, cure earache.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is evidently the _Blatta orientalis_. Pliny and\r\nDioscorides also recommend it in cases of earache. (ii, 38.) None of the\r\nother authorities make much account of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίλφιον,\r\n\r\nSilphium or Laserpitium, _Laserwort_, is an excellent calefacient\r\nmedicine; but it is also flatulent and indigestible. When applied\r\nexternally to the body it is more active, and especially its juice, being\r\npossessed of attractive powers. It has also some purgative property.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It has long appeared to us that one passage in the works\r\nof Dioscorides is of itself quite decisive of the question as to the\r\nidentity of the ancient silphium and our assafœtida. Treating of the\r\ngum-resin, sagapenum, he says, “in smell it is intermediate between\r\ngalbanum and the juice of silphium.” (iii, 85.) Now, in Duncan’s\r\nEdinburgh Materia Medica, it is said of sagapenum, that “it holds a\r\nkind of middle place between assafœtida and galbanum.” (Sixth edition,\r\n387.) Its juice, that is to say, its concrete juice, or gum-resin, was\r\nassafœtida, of which the Cyrenaic and Median juices, already treated\r\nof by us, were varieties. The stalk, the leaves, and the juice are all\r\ntreated of by Dioscorides, in his chapter on Silphium, wherein he has\r\ngiven so full an account of them that we dare scarcely venture upon\r\nan abstract of it. He says of the varieties of the juice, that the\r\nCyrenean is the most fragrant, so that when tasted it scarcely affects\r\nthe breath, whereas, the Median and Syrian are weaker, and have a\r\nmore offensive smell. He says of it, that of the different parts of\r\nit, the most efficacious is the juice, then the leaves, and then the\r\nstalk. He recommends it, both externally and internally, for a great\r\nvariety of medicinal purposes, in diseases of the eyes, in toothache,\r\nas an application to the bites of venomous animals, as an application\r\nto gangrene, corns, and callus; in affections of the bronchi, and of\r\nthe tonsils, in cynanche, catarrhs, pleurisy, jaundice, and dropsy; in\r\nrigors, along with pepper, frankincense, and wine, in cæliac affections,\r\nand in short, in a great many other complaints. (iii, 84.) But long\r\nbefore his time the silphium had been introduced into the practice of\r\nmedicine, and used in procidentia and other complaints. See Hippocrates\r\n(De Fistulis; de ratione vict. in acut., &c.) It is indisputably the\r\nlaser and laserpitium of the Latin authors. See in particular Celsus (iv,\r\n2); Pliny (H. N. xxii, 49.) The latter passes an elaborate encomium upon\r\nit, founded, however, for the most part on the contents of Dioscorides’s\r\nchapter on the Silphium. From it the identity of the Greek silphion\r\nand the Roman laser is clearly made out. Passing by Galen, Aëtius, and\r\nOribasius, who supply nothing very interesting on this head, we now\r\nturn to the Arabians. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 9, 52, 474); Rhases (Cont..\r\nult. i, 50); Serapion (De Simpl. 251); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 84.) Avicenna describes two varieties of the _Assa_ seu\r\n_Laser_, namely, the _fœtida_ and the _odorifera_, the virtues of which\r\nhe gives in nearly the same terms as Dioscorides. He says distinctly\r\nthat the fetid or black kind is not used in the cooking of food. He\r\npraises them as procuring eructations and acting as carminatives, and as\r\nproving stomachic. There appears to be a disagreement among the Arabian\r\nauthorities of Serapion regarding the virtues of the assa, some of them\r\nrepresenting it as good for the stomach and liver, and others as bad.\r\nOne of them, Habix, mentions that it was used as an application to the\r\nwounds of poisoned arrows, and to preserve meat from putrefaction. Ebn\r\nBaithar’s Arabian authorities describe very accurately the two varieties\r\nof the assa, namely, the fragrant and the fetid, and commend both very\r\nhighly as medicines, more especially as carminatives, and as acting\r\nvery beneficially on the stomach, liver, and uterus. Some of them say\r\nthat assa promotes menstruation, and even procures the expulsion of\r\nthe fœtus. The assafœtida still retains the name of _silphion_ in the\r\nGreek Pharmacopœia. (Athens, 1837.) M. Pacho says that the Arabs call it\r\n_derias_, and he proposes to class it as a species of laserwort, under\r\nthe name of _Laserpitium derias_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίσων,\r\n\r\nSison, _Bastard Stone-parsley_, is heating, diuretic, and digestive. It\r\nlikewise promotes menstruation and removes obstructions of the viscera.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to be the _Sison Amomum_, called by Miller _the\r\nStone-parsley_ or _German Amomum_. Our author copies from Dioscorides,\r\nwho further mentions of it that the natives of Syria, where it grows,\r\nuse it as a condiment. Galen commends it as being bitterish, and hence\r\nproving diuretic, digestive, emmenagogue, and deobstruent. We do not find\r\nit in the works of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίον,\r\n\r\nSium, _Water Parsnip_ or _Celery_ (?), is hot, diuretic, and discutient.\r\nIt breaks down renal calculi and promotes menstruation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to us highly probable that it is the _Sium\r\nlatifolium_, or Upright Water-parsnip, which once held a place in modern\r\nDispensatories, and not the _S. nodiflorum_, as Dierbach decides the σ.\r\nof Hippocrates to be. It is the laver of the Romans, and is recommended\r\nby Pliny as a cure for tormina. (H. N. xxvi, 32.) See Harduin (Annot.\r\nl. c.) Dioscorides says it is useful in dysentery, and is diuretic,\r\nemmenagogue, and lithontriptic. (ii, 153.) Galen gives the same account\r\nof it as our author. It does not occur in the works of Celsus. The\r\nArabians, in treating of it, borrow almost everything from Dioscorides.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 556, 633); Serapion (De Simpl. 290.) The latter\r\ndescribes it as a species of apium which grows in water.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣίσαρον,\r\n\r\nSisarum, _Garden Parsnip_; the root, when boiled, is stomachic and\r\ndiuretic, being heating in the third order. The seed consists of subtile\r\nparticles, and is powerfully discutient. It is, therefore, given to\r\npersons affected with hiccough and tormina, in wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Pastinaca sativa_ or _Garden Parsnip_, according\r\nto Sprengel. In the translation of Rhases it is said to be the same\r\nas _nigella_, but this would seem to be a mistake. (Contin. xxxvii.)\r\nDioscorides briefly says of it, that it is palatable, stomachic,\r\ndiuretic, and a whetter of the appetite. (ii, 139.) Galen says it is\r\ncalefacient, with a certain degree of bitterness and astringency. It\r\nappears certainly to be the siser of Pliny and Celsus, the latter of whom\r\nplaces it in his list of diuretics. (ii, 31.) The Arabians, in treating\r\nof it, copy from Dioscorides and Galen. See in particular Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 652.) From the account we have given of this article it will be seen\r\nthat recent authorities hold that it is _not_ the same as the _Sium\r\nSisarum_, Skerret, as has been generally held, but the Parsnip. It would\r\nfollow from this that it is identical with the ἐλαφόβοσκος of Dioscorides\r\n(iii, 73), which we must say that we are scarcely prepared to join\r\nSprengel in admitting. After mature deliberation, then, we fear we must\r\nrank this with the undetermined articles in the ancient Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣισύμβριον,\r\n\r\nSisymbrium, _Wild Mint_, called also Cardamine, because it is like the\r\nCardamus. When dried, it belongs to the first order of calefacients and\r\ndiscutients; but when in a humid state, to the second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of his first species that it resembles the\r\ngarden mint, and Pliny states that it degenerates into calamintha or\r\nwild mint. It would appear, then, to be a species of mint. Stackhouse\r\ninclines to this opinion. (Index to Theophrastus.) The other, called also\r\ncardamine and sium, can be no other than the _Nasturtium officinale_.\r\nDioscorides says of the former species, that it is useful in strangury,\r\ncalculus, tormina, and singultus; and that in a cataplasm it relieves\r\nheadache, is useful in the stings of wasps and bees, and stops vomiting.\r\nHis other species he recommends as an application to certain diseases of\r\nthe skin. (ii, 155.) Galen, in like manner, treats of the two species\r\nin nearly the same terms as our author, whose description of the former\r\nspecies, by the carelessness of transcribers, is given under the head of\r\nthe preceding article, Sisarum. The Arabians treat both of the sisymbrium\r\nand the nasturtium, but it is not clear that they apply these terms to\r\nthe same substances as Dioscorides does.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκαμμωνία,\r\n\r\nScammonia, _Scammony_, has the properties of heating, discussing, and\r\nclearing away bilious matters, more especially the juice of it, which\r\ndiscusses phymata, kills the fœtus when applied in a pessary, and removes\r\nleprosy. As an embrocation with vinegar and rose-oil, it cures chronic\r\nheadaches; and the root, when drunk, acts as a purgative both by itself\r\nand in decoction. Boiled with vinegar and barley-flour, it is applied to\r\ndiseased hip-joints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Convolvulus Scammonia_. Dioscorides\r\nlikewise describes another species, which Sprengel supposes to be the\r\n_C. farinosus_, L. The scammony is called δάκρυ κάμωνος by Nicander,\r\nand δακρύδιον by Alexander. (i, 10.) All the Greek, Latin, and Arabian\r\nauthorities who make mention of it, state that it is a powerful\r\npurgative, which evacuates phlegm and bile. Marcellus Empiricus correctly\r\nremarks, that it does not answer when the stomach is weak. Celsus\r\nprescribes it for the broad intestinal worm, and in other cases. (iv,\r\n17.) It also occurs in the Hippocratic collection. This is an article\r\nwhich the Arabians treat of very fully. See Serapion (De Simpl. 303);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 628); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 612); Haly Abbas (Pract.\r\nii, 54, 554); Mesne (De Simpl. i); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar\r\n(ii, 27.) The last of these writes of it at very great length. Haly Abbas\r\nsays scammony purges bile, attracts humours from the distant parts of the\r\nbody, but is injurious to the stomach and liver. Avicenna and Serapion\r\nagree that it hurts the stomach, liver, and heart. They also state that\r\nit is a purgative, but one not in general to be depended upon, as\r\ndifferent preparations of it act with different degrees of activity. They\r\nrecommend it as an external application in cases of leprosy, scabies,\r\nand other cutaneous diseases. One of Serapion’s Arabian authorities\r\ngives a very minute description of the different varieties of it. He\r\nsays the dose of it is from 6 to 20 grs. In large doses, one of Rhases’s\r\nauthorities states that it brings off bilious and bloody discharges, but\r\nin small doses, it is said to be diuretic without acting upon the bowels\r\nat all. An overdose, Avicenna remarks, may prove fatal. Mesue treats of\r\nit at great length and with much judgment, giving very minute directions\r\nabout the choice of the different kinds of it, and the correction of any\r\nbad qualities they may possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκάνδιξ,\r\n\r\nScandix, _Shepherd’s-needle_, is a wild potherb, heating and desiccative\r\nin the second order. It is diuretic, and removes visceral obstructions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of this potherb in Book I. It is the\r\n_Scandix australis_. Our author takes his character of this plant from\r\nDioscorides. (ii, 167.) Galen infers from its being slightly acrid and\r\nbitter, that it is diuretic and deobstruent. None of the Arabians, we\r\nbelieve, treat of it, with the exception of Ebn Baithar. (ii, 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκίγκος,\r\n\r\nScincus, _Skink_; the parts about the kidneys are drunk to occasion\r\nerection of the privy member. The seed of lettuce, when drunk with water,\r\nis supposed to counteract them; and likewise the decoction of lentils\r\nwith honey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The Skink is a small animal, like a lizard, of the shape of\r\na crocodile, and from ten to twelve inches in length. It was described\r\nby Ray and Gesner under the name of _Crocodilus terrestris_. Its Linnæan\r\nname is _Scincus officinalis_ or _algeriensis_. Dioscorides calls it a\r\nland crocodile, and recommends it in the same complaints as our author.\r\nHe concludes by saying of it that it is an ingredient in antidotes;\r\nand, in fact, its principal use was in the composition of the famous\r\nTheriaca. Such of the Arabians as notice it give it the same medicinal\r\ncharacter as the Greeks, that is to say, they represent it to be\r\nstrongly aphrodisiac. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 596) and Ebn\r\nBaithar (ii, 32.) The latter gives a lengthy and interesting account of\r\nit. Rhases briefly notices it without saying anything of its medicinal\r\nuses. (Contin. l. ult. ii, 681.) In the East the skink is still eaten as\r\na restorative and aphrodisiac. See Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 278.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκίλλα,\r\n\r\nSquilla, _the Squill_, is possessed of incisive powers, and is\r\ncalefacient and desiccative in the second order. It is better to take it\r\nroasted or boiled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Scilla maritima_. It is mentioned by Hippocrates,\r\nand was a favorite medicine of the ancient physicians. Dioscorides’s\r\nchapter on the Squill contains much valuable matter. His description\r\nof the process of baking squills is so like that given in Pemberton’s\r\nedition of the ‘London Dispensatory,’ that one may take the latter as a\r\ntranslation of it: “_Scillæ coctio_, the baking of squills. Inclose the\r\nsquill in paste of wheat flour, having first separated the outer skin and\r\nthe hard part, from which the fibrous roots grow; then bake the squill in\r\nan oven till the paste is dry, and the squill is rendered soft and tender\r\nthroughout.” He recommends it in cases requiring a copious evacuation of\r\nurine, such as dropsies, diseases of the stomach, those cases in which\r\nthe food floats on the stomach, in jaundice, chronic coughs, asthma,\r\n&c. He also says of it that it is alexipharmic. (ii, 202.) Celsus\r\nfrequently prescribes “scilla cocta,” as in tympanites and in anasarca.\r\n(iii.) It is frequently recommended and described, in a word, by all the\r\nauthorities, Greek, Roman, and Arabian, in the same class of cases. See\r\nGalen (De Simpl. viii); Aëtius (i); Oribasius (Med. Coll. 12); Apuleius\r\n(De Herbis); Columella (De R. Rust. xii, 33); Serapion (De Simpl. 304);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 590); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 680); Mesue (De Simpl.\r\nvi); Ebn Baithar (ii, 216, 309); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 43). Serapion’s account of its medicinal properties is\r\nparticularly full. It is given, he says, as a laxative in fevers, and\r\nin dropsy as a diuretic; as a remedy for indigestion, for jaundice and\r\ntormina of the bowels; for an old cough, asthma, and spitting of blood;\r\nand for cleansing the breast of gross humours. It is to be avoided, he\r\nsays, when there is an ulcer in any internal part. Apuleius recommends\r\nit along with vinegar and honey in dropsy. He adds, that it evacuates\r\nby urine. Columella gives a receipt for making a vinum scilliticum,\r\nwhich is useful, he says, “ad concoquendum, ad corpus reficiendum,\r\nitemque ad veterem tussim et ad stomachum.” (l. c.) Mesue particularly\r\ncommends it as an expectorant, and recommends the vinegar, the oxymel,\r\nand the syrup for this and other medicinal purposes. Avicenna treats of\r\nit with his wonted accuracy, recommending it in complaints of the gums,\r\nteeth, and mouth; for asthma, and all inveterate coughs; in epilepsy,\r\nand in melancholy. He moreover particularly commends it in diseases of\r\nthe spleen, and in dropsy and jaundice. He forbids it to be used in\r\nulceration of the viscera. Ebn Baithar gives very copious extracts from\r\npreceding authorities, both Greek and Arabian. He treats separately of\r\nthe scilla and pancratium. See under the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκολοπένδρα,\r\n\r\nScolopendra; the sea scolopendra, when boiled in oil and rubbed upon a\r\npart, acts as a depilatory. When burnt it occasions pruritus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Book V. The sea scolopendra is the _Aphrodite aculeata_.\r\nAll the authorities who notice it recommend it for the same purposes as\r\nour author. See Dioscorides (ii, 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκολοπένδριον,\r\n\r\nScolopendrium, the same as asplenium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Asplenium Ceterach_. See under Asplenium.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκόλυμος,\r\n\r\nScolymus, _Golden Thistle_, is a calefacient and desiccative medicine of\r\nthe second order. The root of it, when boiled with wine, brings off a\r\nquantity of fetid urine, and cures the fetid smell of the armpits and of\r\nthe whole body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From the descriptions of it given by Theophrastus (H. P.\r\nvi, 4), and Dioscorides (iii, 14), one can scarcely entertain a doubt\r\nthat it was the _Scolymus Hispanicus_, or Spanish Cardoons, an esculent\r\nroot, well known in the southern parts of Europe. Compare Sprengel (Ad\r\nDioscor. iii, 14) with Lindley (Veg. King. 709), and see Beckmann (Hist.\r\nof Invent. under Artichoke). Dioscorides gives exactly the same account\r\nof its medicinal virtues as our author. (l. c.) Galen writes elaborately\r\nof it, but his conclusions, as to its properties, are the same as those\r\nof Dioscorides. We have not been able to trace it out in the works of\r\nthe Arabians, unless it be their _harsef_. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 332);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 168). The truth is, that the term _scolymus_ was\r\na puzzle to the ancient authorities and to their modern commentators,\r\nbeing sometimes, as is supposed, applied also to the _Cynara Scolymus_,\r\nor artichoke. See Parkinson (pluries). We have treated of the scolymus\r\nas a potherb in the First Volume, p. 114. We have hinted our belief that\r\nthe _harsef_ or _harxaf_ of the Arabians was identical with the Σ. of the\r\nGreeks. We are confirmed in this opinion by a comparison of Dioscorides\r\nwith Avicenna (l. c.), although we find that Salmasius referred it to the\r\nartichoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκόρδιον,\r\n\r\nScordium, _Water Germander_, is composed of varied powers, being bitter,\r\nsour, and acrid. It therefore at the same time purges and heats the\r\nviscera; promotes the urinary and menstrual discharges, warms parts which\r\nhad been affected with cold, agglutinates and cleanses wounds, and proves\r\nincarnative when sprinkled dry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is clearly the _Teucrium Scordium_, or Water Germander.\r\nDioscorides commends it for its diuretic, emmenagogue, and expectorant\r\npowers, when given internally; and for cleansing foul ulcers. Compare\r\nhis account of it with its characters as stated by Dr. Hill. Our author\r\ncondenses Galen’s statement of its medicinal properties. Galen remarks\r\nthat it would appear to have got its name from its resemblance in\r\nqualities to the scorodon or garlic. The Arabians would seem to have\r\nconfounded the scordium with the scorodon. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 622), and\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 331).\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκόρδον,\r\n\r\nAllium, _Garlic_, is healing and desiccative in the fourth degree. But\r\nthe ophioscordon, or wild garlic, is stronger than the cultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We are inclined to set down the two varieties of this\r\nsubstance as being _Allium sativum_ and _arenarium_. See Parkinson (vii,\r\n29), and Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. ii, 181). Dioscorides gives a lengthy\r\nstatement of the medicinal virtues of the garlic, which, as Galen\r\nsomewhere says, was the great theriac of rustics. Dioscorides says it\r\nis the best of all medicines in the bites of vipers when taken along\r\nwith wine, and that it forms an excellent cataplasm for the bites of\r\nmad dogs. He also recommends it as an application to various cutaneous\r\ncomplaints, such as leprosy and furfures; as an emmenagogue, both in the\r\nform of a hip-bath and fumigation; as a diuretic and remedy in dropsical\r\ndiseases. (ii, 81.) Galen, like our author, merely states the general\r\ncharacters of the two species. It is frequently mentioned in the works\r\nof Hippocrates and in those of Celsus. The latter ranks it among the\r\nthings “mali succi,” and calls it acrid, flatulent, heating, laxative\r\nof the bowels, &c. (ii, 21, 26, et alibi.) The Arabians treat of it at\r\ngreat length. See Serapion (De Simpl. 331); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 72); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i. 36.) They recommend it in\r\neructations, in dropsy as a laxative and diuretic, and as an emmenagogue.\r\nThey say a clyster of it relieves sciatica, and a gargle of it is useful\r\nin toothache, and clears the voice. Avicenna affirms, from personal\r\nexperience, that it is an excellent medicine in the case of persons stung\r\nby venomous reptiles. Ruffus, as quoted by Serapion, says it is hurtful\r\nto the ears, the liver, the lungs, and the kidneys. Fresh garlic, he\r\nsays, is diuretic, loosens the bowels, and is vermifuge. Another of his\r\nauthorities says, raw garlic is vermifuge, and useful in strangury.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκορδόπρασον,\r\n\r\nScordoprason, _Garlic-leek_, in taste and powers is compounded of the\r\ngarlic and leek.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We are disposed to set it down as being _Allium\r\nScorodoprason_. None of the authorities supply any interesting\r\ninformation under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκορπιοειδὲς,\r\n\r\nScorpioides, _Caterpillar_, is heating in the third order, and\r\ndesiccative in the second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We suppose it to be the _Scorpiurus sulcatus_, L., which\r\nis synonymous with the _Scorpioides_, Tournefort. Dioscorides merely\r\nrecommends it as an application to the bites of scorpions. (iv, 192.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκόρπιος,\r\n\r\nScorpius, _the Scorpion_; the land one, when applied raw, is a remedy for\r\nits own bite, and in like manner, when eaten roasted. The sea scorpion’s\r\nbile is useful in suffusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Book V. Avicenna recommends the oil of _scorpions_\r\nin diseases of the ear. (ii, 2, 64.) The sea-scorpion is the _Cottus\r\nscorpius_. Dioscorides recommends its gall in cataracts, albugo, and\r\ndimness of sight. (ii, 14.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣκωρία,\r\n\r\nRecrementum, _Dross_; all kinds are considerably desiccative, but that of\r\niron more than the others. This, when pulverized and boiled in vinegar,\r\ncures purulent discharges from the ears in a wonderful manner; and when\r\ntaken with oxymel, proves a remedy to those who have drunk aconite. That\r\nof lead is similar to lead itself, but more astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is called recrementum by Celsus. (v, 15.) It is the dross\r\nof a metal which is collected on the outside of the furnace while the\r\nmetal is purified by heat. See Pliny (H. N. xxxiv, 27) and Matthiolus\r\n(Ad Dioscor. v, 54.) Dioscorides says of the recrementum plumbi that it\r\nhas the same powers as burnt lead (v, 97), and of the recrementum ferri,\r\nthat it is a remedy in cases of poisoning with aconite. (v, 94.) Celsus\r\nranks the recrementum plumbi among the emollients. (Ibid.) Avicenna\r\nrecommends the recrementum ferri as an astringent in cases of hemorrhoids\r\nand other fluxes. Like Dioscorides and our author, he says that it is an\r\nantidote to aconitum. One of Serapion’s authorities, Adamasti, says of\r\nthe recrementum argenti, that it is cooling and desiccative, and useful\r\nin cardiac disease, and another, Alcanzi, says it is good for scabies and\r\nprurigo. His other extracts are from Dioscorides, Galen, and Paulus. Ebn\r\nBaithar gives an interesting exposition of this subject, but it is mostly\r\nmade up from the authorities already quoted by us. (i, 348.) Rhases\r\ntreats of it in like manner. (Cont. l. ult. i, 234.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣμίλαξ,\r\n\r\nSmilax or Taxus, _the Yew_, is a tree of deleterious properties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Taxus baccata_, L. See Book V. (48.) It appears\r\nremarkable that Dioscorides should have allowed this article a place\r\nin the Materia Medica, seeing that he himself says that he had noticed\r\nit merely to guard against it. He says that in Narbonia (Languedoc or\r\nSavoy), the yew-tree was possessed of such a power as to prove fatal\r\nto persons sitting or sleeping in its shade. (ii, 80.) We have stated,\r\nhowever, elsewhere (v, 48) that great difference of opinion has prevailed\r\nregarding this reputed noxious power of the yew.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣμύρνα,\r\n\r\nMyrrha, _Myrrh_, is of the second order of calefacients and desiccants.\r\nIt, therefore, agglutinates wounds of the head when sprinkled upon them.\r\nIt has also some bitterness; and hence it kills worms and the fœtus; and\r\nit is detergent, and, therefore, is mixed with ophthalmic remedies. It is\r\nlikewise expectorant without roughening the trachea. Bœotian myrrh has\r\ncalefacient, emollient, and solvent powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That this is the same as our myrrh is indisputable, and\r\nthe best botanical authorities are now pretty well agreed that it is\r\nthe product of a dwarf shrub, to which they have given the name of\r\n_Balsamodendron Myrrha_. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 460); Pereira (Mat.\r\nMed. 1187.) It is mentioned in what is perhaps the oldest literary\r\nproduction in existence (Genesis xxxvii, 25), and is frequently noticed\r\nas a medicine in the works which bear the name of Hippocrates. (De\r\nSuperfœt.; de Muliebr.) See further ‘Œconom. Hippocrat.’ (347) and\r\nDierbach (Arsn. des Hipp. 224.) In short, this gum-resin was much used\r\nin the ancient practice of medicine. According to Dioscorides it is\r\ncalefacient, soporific, agglutinative, desiccative, and astringent. He\r\nrecommends it in chronic coughs and asperities of the trachea. He also\r\nstates that it was used in ulcers of the eye and other complaints of a\r\nlike nature. He further says of it that it is anthelminthic; that it\r\ncures fetor of the mouth, and likewise of the armpits when used as an\r\nointment with liquid alum; that in a gargle with oil it strengthens\r\nthe gums and teeth. He describes two kinds of liquid myrrh, which he\r\ncalls _Stacte_; the finest was that which runs fluid from the tree\r\nwithout cutting. The other was a fluid myrrh, taken out of the midst of\r\nthe larger pieces of the solid kind. See Hill (Mat. Med.) The account\r\nwhich Pliny gives of myrrh is highly interesting, but does not contain\r\nmuch that would answer our present purpose. (See H. N. xii, 33-6.)\r\nCelsus makes mention of the _stacte_ (v, 23), and prescribes the myrrh\r\nfrequently as a concocting and agglutinating substance. Galen describes\r\nit in two of his works. (De Simpl. 109, and De Antidot. T. ii, 433,\r\ned. Basil.) Our author’s account of this substance is condensed from\r\nthe former of these works. Aëtius in like manner borrows from him, as\r\nOribasius does from Dioscorides. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2,\r\n468); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 474); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Serapion\r\n(De Simpl. 292); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 41); Ebn Baithar (ii, 496.) Our\r\nlimits prevent us from venturing upon an exposition of what these authors\r\nhave written upon this subject, but this is the less to be regretted,\r\nas we do not find that they add anything of much practical importance\r\nto the information supplied by their Grecian masters. They confirm,\r\nhowever, by their authority, all that the Greeks had stated regarding the\r\nvirtues of myrrh as an emmenagogue and a medicine capable of accelerating\r\ndelivery. They are also agreed that it is diuretic and expectorant. One\r\nof Serapion’s authorities says it evacuates fluids from the belly when\r\napplied as a plaster. Another of them says that in a masticatory it\r\nevacuates the brain.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the Bœotian myrrh mentioned by Dioscorides, Galen,\r\nand our author, was the Alexanders or _Smyrnium Olusatrum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣμύρνιον,\r\n\r\nSmyrnium, _Alsander_ (called also Hipposelinum and Apium silvestre) is\r\nheating and desiccative of the third order, being stronger than parsley,\r\nbut weaker than stone-parsley. It is, therefore, emmenagogue and diuretic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This, it would appear, is not the _Smyrnium Olusatrum_, but\r\neither the _Smyrnium Dioscoridis_, or, as supposed by Dodonæus, the\r\n_perfoliatum_. In another place we have set it down as the latter, and\r\ntreated of it as an article of food. (Vol. I, 114.) All the authorities\r\ngive it nearly the same character as our author. See Dioscorides (iii,\r\n72); Galen (De Simpl.); Avicenna (ii, 2, 55.) All agree that it is an\r\nexcellent diuretic and emmenagogue. It is the _olusatrum_ of Scribonius\r\nLargus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣόγχος,\r\n\r\nSonchus, _Sow-thistle_, is astringent and sensibly cooling both\r\nwhen applied externally and eaten. But when dried, it is moderately\r\ncalefacient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear to be the _Sonchus oleraceus_, but this\r\nis not quite certain. Dioscorides describes three species, of which\r\nthe first two are, perhaps, but varieties of the _Sonchus oleraceus_,\r\nalthough some of the authorities would refer the first to some distinct\r\nspecies, not well determined. Galen and our author describe only one\r\nspecies, which would certainly appear to have been the _S. oleraceus_, a\r\nwell-known plant, which held a place in our Dispensatories until a late\r\ndate. See Quincy (i, 11, 510.) Dioscorides calls it sub-astringent, and\r\nrecommends it in a cataplasm for heat of the stomach and inflammations,\r\nand its juice for stomach-ache and to attract milk; when applied on wool,\r\nhe says it relieves inflammations of the anus and uterus; and that its\r\nroot and stem are useful to persons bitten by scorpions. (ii, 158.) Galen\r\nmerely states its temperament and qualities in general terms. We are not\r\naware that it is described by any of the Arabians, with the exception of\r\nEbn Baithar, who merely gives the descriptions of it from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. (i, 211.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣπαργάνιον,\r\n\r\nSparganium; this also is possessed of desiccative powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Sparganium simplex_. Pliny recommends it as an\r\nantidote to the sting of serpents. (H. N. xxv, 63.) He, as usual, borrows\r\nfrom Dioscorides. (iv, 21.) Galen treats of it as briefly as our author.\r\nFew, if any of the other authorities, notice it. Its congener, the _S.\r\nramosum_, is still kept in the shops with the reputation of curing the\r\nbite of the viper. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣπαρτὸς,\r\n\r\nGenista, _Broom_, by which they bind vines; the fruit and flower of\r\nit, when drunk with honeyed water to the amount of five oboli, purge\r\nupwards, like white hellebore, without danger. But the fruit also purges\r\ndownwards. The twigs remedy ischiatic diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Spartium junceum_. It is the genista\r\nof the Latins, as Silvius states in his commentary on Mesue. He says that\r\nit is a powerful diuretic, and its seeds are still sometimes used with\r\nthis intention. Mesue further commends it as an emetic in gout and other\r\narthritic diseases. Dioscorides and Pliny give nearly the same account\r\nof its medicinal properties as our author. Dioscorides further commends\r\nit in sciatica and cynanche, and when given as a clyster in the former\r\ncomplaint. (iv, 155.) It is not easy to trace it in the works of the\r\nother authorities, except Ebn Baithar, who copies principally from Galen\r\nor Dioscorides. (i. 489.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣπεκλάριον ἢ σφεκλάριον,\r\n\r\nLapis specularis, which some use instead of specula in their windows, and\r\nhence it has been called diaphanous. Being of the nature of gypsum, it\r\nhas powers like burnt shells or oysters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the Gypsum speculare or Selenite, as is evident from\r\nour author’s description of it. Seneca says that in his time it had come\r\nto be used in windows from its transparency. (Ep. 60.) See further, Pliny\r\n(H. N. xxxvi, 45.) See Book V, 58. The Arabians praise its virtues in\r\nthe cure of all fluxes; and Agricola mentions that in his time it was\r\nfrequently given for the cure of dysenteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣπόγγος,\r\n\r\nSpongia, _Sponge_; the recent, which still preserves the smell of the\r\nsea, when applied with water, wine, or oxycrate, agglutinates wounds; but\r\nif burnt, it has acrid and discutient powers. When burnt with asphaltos\r\nor liquid pitch, and applied hot, it stops hemorrhages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aristotle, Pliny, Philoponus, Phile, and Avicenna acknowledge\r\nthe animal nature of sponges, and yet we find it stated in most of our\r\nmodern treatises on natural history that the ancients supposed them to\r\nbe vegetables. Ebn Baithar, we believe, stands alone among the ancient\r\nauthorities in maintaining that there is no truth in the opinion that\r\nthe sponge is an animal, but that, on the contrary, it is decidedly a\r\nvegetable which grows from the rocks. (i, 45.) Avicenna recommends the\r\nuse of sponge in the same cases as our author does. Serapion gives nearly\r\nthe same account of it. He says that the stones found in sponges are\r\nlithontriptic. Of the two species described by Dioscorides, the hard\r\nis the _S. fasciculata_, Pall., and the soft the _S. officinalis_. He\r\nrecommends sponge tent for dilating fistulous ulcers. He says they may be\r\napplied like tents to sores; that with vinegar they restrain hemorrhages;\r\nand that burnt sponges are useful in dry ophthalmy, and whenever you\r\nwant to deterge or astringe; but that when washed, they apply better in\r\nophthalmic remedies; and that, when burnt with pitch, they are suitable\r\nin hemorrhages. (v, 137.) In the Hippocratic treatises this term is\r\ngenerally applied to the tonsils or glands of the neck, as at ‘Epidem.’\r\n(iv.) But in one passage of a work, certainly not genuine, it appears\r\nto be used for the sponge. (De Morbis, ii.) Celsus prescribes a sponge\r\nsqueezed out of oil, vinegar, or cold water as an application to relieve\r\nthe swelling and heat of the gout (iv), and for other medicinal purposes.\r\nGalen gives an interesting article under this head, and describes an\r\ningenious process by which, he says, that he had known a hemorrhage\r\nstopped. A sponge dipped in asphaltus, or, in the absence of it, in tar,\r\nhaving been laid on the bleeding place, it was set fire to until it\r\nformed an eschar on the surface, while the remainder of it was left as a\r\nfarther cover to the vessels. (De Simpl. xi.) The Arabians treat fully\r\nof the “Spongia maris,” and quote what Dioscorides and Galen had written\r\nrespecting it. Avicenna decidedly says that sponge was supposed to be an\r\nanimal possessed of motion. He and Rhases recommend it principally for\r\ncleansing sores and stopping bleeding. (ii, 2, 595, and Cont. l. ult.\r\n676.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣπόδιον,\r\n\r\nSpodium has similar powers to the pompholyx.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is nearly the same as the Pompholyx. Pliny thus states\r\nthe difference between them: “Etiamnum in ærariis reperiuntur, quæ\r\nvocant pompholygem et spodon. Differentia quod pompholyx loturâ paratur,\r\nspodos illota est.” (H. N. xxxiv, 33.) The name, in modern times, has\r\nbeen applied to burnt ivory. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 260), and\r\nPlatearius (De Simp. Med. 250.) The ancient spodium was an impure oxyd\r\nof zinc. The term, however, was sometimes applied to other recrements,\r\nas we are informed by Pliny (l. c.), and Dioscorides (v, 85.) He gives a\r\nmore minute description of the preparation of it and of pompholyx. The\r\nArabians treat of both under the general name of _Tucia_ or Tutty, which\r\nwas long retained in modern times. They used it very freely in diseases\r\nof the eyes, and also in those about the genital organs. See Serapion (c.\r\n422); Avicenna (ii, 2, 695); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 730); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 45, 474.) The spodium occurs frequently as an ingredient\r\nin the collyria and ointments described by Celsus (v, 6), &c. We need\r\nscarcely remind the reader that tutty ointment has continued to be used\r\nas an ophthalmic even to our own times. The _spodos_ of the Hippocratic\r\nwriters would appear to have been applied in a more general sense to\r\nvarious recrements of the metals. (De Ulceribus.) The spodium of the\r\nArabians would seem to have been the ashes of the privet. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 609); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 675.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣταφυλῖνος,\r\n\r\nStaphylinus, _Carrot_, is diuretic and promotes menstruation,\r\nparticularly the seed and root. But the leaves being possessed of\r\ndetergent powers agree with phagedænic affections when applied green\r\nalong with honey. The wild is for all purposes stronger than the\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. As Sprengel states, it is undoubtedly a variety of the\r\n_Daucus Carota_, L., or _Wild Carrot_. Diphilus, as quoted by Athenæus,\r\nsays that it is acrid, nutritive, moderately stomachic, laxative,\r\nflatulent, indigestible, diuretic, and aphrodisiacal. (Deipnos. ix, 2.)\r\nPliny mentions that it proves useful in strangury, dropsy, and several\r\nother complaints. (H. N. xx, 15.) Plinius Valerianus says of it that it\r\nhad been given in diseases of the liver, spleen, loins, and kidneys, in\r\nhydromel. (iv, 32.) Our author’s account of its medicinal properties\r\nis mostly condensed from Dioscorides. He recommends it strongly as a\r\ndiuretic, emmenagogue, and aphrodisiac, and says of it, that applied\r\n_per vaginam_ it procures the expulsion of the fœtus. (iii, 52.) Galen\r\nand Aëtius give nearly the same account of it as our author. The Arabian\r\nauthorities speak of it in the same terms. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 287);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. iii, 18); Serapion (c. 265.) The commentator\r\nEustathius mentions its aphrodisiacal properties. (Ad Iliad. xviii, 560.)\r\nAccording to Dierbach, the σ. of Hippocrates comprehends both the _Daucus\r\nCarota_ and _guttatus_. It would appear to us that this is the “Pastinaca\r\nagrestis” of Celsus (ii, 31), although his editor, Dr. Milligan, decides\r\notherwise with regard to it. In confirmation of our opinion we refer to\r\nPliny (l. c.), and to Beckmann’s ingenious disquisition on our kitchen\r\nvegetables in his ‘Hist. of Invent.’ He seems clearly to make out that\r\nthe daucus, staphylinus, carota, and pastinaca were all merely varieties\r\nof the _Daucus Carota_. He is in some doubts, however, whether the\r\n“pastinaca” was not also sometimes applied to the parsnip. See, however,\r\nunder _Daucus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτάχυς,\r\n\r\nStachys, _Base Horehound_, is a shrub resembling horehound, and is\r\ncalefacient in the third degree. It therefore promotes menstruation,\r\nkills the fœtus, and expels the secundines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Stachys Palestina_, or _Base Horehound_. Our\r\nauthor gives exactly the same account of its medicinal properties as\r\nDioscorides and Galen, the latter remarking of it that it not only\r\npromotes menstruation, but is a drug used for procuring abortion.\r\nPliny, by confounding πράσον and πράσιον, says of it that it resembles\r\nthe _porrum_ instead of the marrubium; so that his celebrated editor,\r\nHarduin, holds that the stachys of Pliny is different from that of\r\nDioscorides. (Ad H. N. xxiv, 86.) It is quite clear, however, that the\r\nplants are identical, and accordingly Pliny, like the other, says of his\r\nstachys, that it is emmenagogue. The Arabians do not seem to treat of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτέατα,\r\n\r\nAdipes, _Fats_, or _Grease_; all kinds dilute and warm the human body,\r\nbut their powers vary according to the different temperaments of animals.\r\nThat of swine, then, is the most humid of all, its powers being like\r\nthose of oil. Hence it blunts sharp pains. That of goats is drier\r\nand sooner coagulated, and therefore is used as an injection to those\r\nwho have sharp pains in the rectum. That of geese is hotter and more\r\nattenuate; that of domestic cocks and hens being intermediate. That of\r\nlions is the hottest of all and the most attenuate, hence it is most\r\ndiscutient. That of oxen has an intermediate temperament between swine\r\nand lions. That of bears cures alopecia, that of foxes, earache; as that\r\nof vipers is said to remove hairs and prevent suffusions from forming.\r\nUpon the whole, that of males is the hotter and more desiccative, and of\r\nthem those which have their testicles more than those which have been\r\ncut, and of those which are full-grown than that of the others. All sorts\r\nof grease when long kept become hotter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Fats._ Our author’s account of their medicinal properties\r\nis sufficiently ample. For further information, however, the reader may\r\nconsult Dioscorides and Galen. The former gives very minute and seemingly\r\nimportant directions for the preparations of all these animal fats. We\r\nmay just mention here a little piece of criticism which Galen bestows\r\nin this case upon his much admired predecessor. Dioscorides says of the\r\ngrease _or_ lard of goats, that it is more styptic (στυπτικώτερον) than\r\nthat of swine. Upon which Galen remarks that although Dioscorides had\r\nwritten much and well on the Materia Medica, he often uses words in a\r\nwrong signification, as he does in the present instance, for that the\r\nabove-mentioned term, which properly signifies astringent, must here be\r\nunderstood to mean acrid or pungent. Now we think that Galen is here\r\ncorrect, and that Sprengel’s attempt to bring his author, Dioscorides,\r\nclear off in the present case is not successful. Indeed, as we firmly\r\nbelieve that a greater master of the Greek language than Galen never\r\nexisted, we may always feel secure that where the exact meaning of Greek\r\nterms is concerned, one may safely trust to him. The Arabians under this\r\nhead merely give extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. See in particular\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 461) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 70.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτίμμι,\r\n\r\nAntimonium, _Antimony_, in addition to its desiccative powers, has also\r\nastringency. Hence it is mixed with collyria for the eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. This is evidently the sulphuret of antimony. The native\r\nantimony is so rare a mineral that it is not likely the ancients had any\r\nacquaintance with it, and the factitious antimony is not described by any\r\nancient author. For an account of the ancient antimony, see in particular\r\nDioscorides (v, 99) and Pliny (H. N. xxxiii, 33.) It was much used by the\r\nancients in the composition of the medicines called calliblephara. “Vis\r\nejus astringere et refrigerare principalis autem circa oculos.” Pliny\r\n(l. c.) In the Old Testament the Jewish women are censured for this use\r\nof it. None of the Greek or Latin authors speak of giving it internally\r\nexcept Serapion, who quotes Badigorus (Pythagoras?) as stating that it\r\nproves a remedy for epilepsy and gross superfluities. (c. 249.) In its\r\ncalcined state it was made into pastils of a square form, and hence the\r\nmetal itself is called τετράγωνον by Hippocrates, as has been supposed\r\nby his expositors. See Galen (Exeg.) and Föes (Œcon. Hippocrat. 371.)\r\nHippocrates recommends it as a medicine for purging the head (De Intern.\r\nAffect.), that is to say, as an ingredient in _caputpurgia_, or errhines,\r\nto the use of which he was partial. (See Vol. I, pp. 59, 60 of this\r\nwork.) But with the authorities subsequent to him its principal use would\r\nseem to have been confined to collyria. See in particular Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 48); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43.) Celsus frequently uses it for\r\nthis and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτοιβὴ,\r\n\r\nStœbe, _Knapweed_; the fruit and leaves are desiccative in the third\r\ndegree, being possessed of astringent powers. Hence they agglutinate\r\nlarge wounds; and the decoction of them relieves dysentery, hemorrhages,\r\nand discharges of pus from the ear; and in a cataplasm it is of use in\r\nsuggillations of the eye from a blow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There has been considerable difference of opinion among\r\nmodern authorities on this head, as is fully stated by Parkinson (Theatre\r\nof Plants, 998), and by Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. iv, 12.) We acquiesce in\r\nthe judgment of those who hold it to be the _Poterium spinosum_. See\r\nGalen (De Antidot. 426, T. ii, ed. Basil.) Our author’s notice of it\r\nis manifestly taken from Galen, who, in his turn, is much indebted to\r\nDioscorides. (iv, 12.) None of the others add anything of interest\r\nrespecting it. It does not occur in the works of Hippocrates nor of\r\nCelsus, nor have we been able to detect it in those of the Arabians,\r\nexcept Ebn Baithar, who quotes only Dioscorides and Galen under this\r\nhead. (ii, 19.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nΣτρούθιον. It appears singular that our author should have omitted the\r\nStruthium, which is noticed in this place by Dioscorides and Galen. This\r\nis the celebrated soap-plant used by the fullones or cleansers of cloth\r\nin ancient times. The reader will find a very interesting disquisition\r\non it in Beckmann’s ‘History of Inventions.’ We think there is every\r\nprobability that it was the _Saponaria officinalis_. Dioscorides\r\nrepresents it to be diuretic, emmenagogue, and lithontriptic, a remedy\r\nfor diseases of the chest, the liver, the spleen, and for jaundice;\r\na discutient application to indolent tumours, a sternutatory, and a\r\nmasticatory. (ii, 192.) By the way, the famous writer Lucian mentions\r\nan amusing example of its use as a masticatory. (De Alexandro.) Galen\r\nstates its virtues in general terms; he says it is acrid and detergent,\r\nand hence it acts as a sialogogue. We have not been able to find it in\r\nthe works of Hippocrates. See Pliny (T. ii, 341, 161, 410, ed. Harduin)\r\nand Celsus (v, 18.) The Arabians treat of it very fully. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 133); Serapion (De Simpl. 362); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. iii,\r\n38.) They all hold it to be emetic, and when it cannot be procured they\r\nrecommend in its place nux vomica. They also recommend it for all the\r\nmedicinal purposes enumerated by Dioscorides. The soap-wort has been used\r\nmedicinally in modern times. See Culpeper (172), Lewis (M. M. 339), and\r\nGray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 115.) Quincy gives a very confused account of\r\nit. (138.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia it is still retained. (144.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτοιχάς,\r\n\r\nStœchas, _Cassidony_, or _French Lavender_; it is deobstruent, attenuant,\r\ndetergent, and strengthens all the viscera and the whole habit of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears to be the _Lavandula Stœchas_, or French Lavender.\r\nSee Tournefort (M. M.) Pliny says that it is an odoriferous herb of a\r\nbitter taste. He adds that it promotes menstruation and relieves pains of\r\nthe breast. (H. N. xxvii, 107.) Dioscorides recommends it for diseases\r\nof the chest and for antidotes. (ii, 28.) Galen has some very sensible\r\nremarks on its qualities as perceived by the taste, and recommends it\r\nin the same cases as our author. See also ‘De Antidot.’ (i.) Avicenna\r\nand Rhases recommend it for epilepsy and melancholy. According to the\r\nArabians it is purgative and alexipharmic, but Dr. Hill denies that it\r\npossesses these powers in any considerable degree. It still held a place\r\nin our Mat. Med. when Lewis wrote. (ii, 389.) It is retained in the\r\nmodern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτρατιώτης,\r\n\r\nAchillea, _Yarrow_; that which grows in water is possessed of cold\r\npowers, but the land has astringency; hence it agglutinates ulcers. Some\r\nuse it for hemorrhages and fistulæ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The land is decidedly the _Achillea Millefolium_, the\r\nriver the _Pistia Stratiotes_. The millefoil got the name of Achillea\r\nfrom being supposed the herb used by Achilles in dressing wounds. V.\r\nEustathius (ad Iliad, xi, ad finem.) Our author copies almost word for\r\nword from Galen, who, however, is equally indebted to Dioscorides for the\r\ncharacters of the yarrow. Regarding the water plant, Dioscorides says\r\nthat it preserves wounds free from inflammation, and cures erysipelas\r\nand œdema in a cataplasm with vinegar. (iv, 100, 101.) These plants are\r\nnot to be found in the works of Hippocrates, Celsus, nor of the Arabian\r\nauthorities, as far as we can discover, with the exception of Ebn\r\nBaithar, who merely gives extracts under this head from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen (ii, 30), and of Rhases, who merely quotes Galen. (Cont. l. ult.\r\n637.) The _Pistia Stratiotes_ is still used by the Hindoo physicians as\r\na demulcent in dysuria, and as a cataplasm for hemorrhoids. See Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 125.) The yarrow held a place in our Dispensatory with its\r\nancient character down to a late date. See Quincy (92) and Lewis (M. M.\r\n108.) It still holds a place in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia (109.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτρύχνος,\r\n\r\nStrychnos, Solanum (?), _Nightshade_ (?), or _Alkekengi_, i. e. _Winter\r\nCherry_; the garden and esculent sort is astringent and cooling in the\r\nsecond degree. The halicacabum is like the garden, having a diuretic\r\nfruit like the grape of a vine. The bark of the root of the Strychnos\r\nsomnifera when drunk with wine to the amount of a dram is soporific. And\r\nit has a diuretic seed, being of the third order of refrigerants; hence\r\nwhen drunk in greater quantity than twelve clusters it occasions madness.\r\nThe fourth species is not used internally, but when applied externally it\r\ncures spreading ulcers, belonging to the second order of refrigerants and\r\ndesiccants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We must not venture upon the discussion of disputed points\r\nrespecting the _Strychni_ of the ancients, for which we beg to refer\r\nour readers to the Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon, and we shall\r\nmerely state our conclusions so far as they are interesting to the\r\nprofessional reader. Of the four species described by Dioscorides, the\r\n1st, or Strychnus hortensis, is the _Solanum nigrum_, or its variety _S.\r\nminiatum_; the 2d, or Halicacabum, is the _Physalis alkekengi_; the 3d,\r\nor S. somniferum, is the _Physalis somnifera_; and the 4th, or Furialis,\r\nis the _Solanum Sodomæum_. Several learned authorities, however, have\r\ntaken the last for the _Atropa Belladonna_. Our author in the main\r\nfollows Dioscorides, who treats of the virtues of the _Strychni_ at\r\nso great length that we dare not attempt to follow him in the present\r\ninstance. The first he does not administer internally, but recommends\r\nit very largely as an external application for erysipelas, herpes,\r\nheadache, heat of the stomach, affections of the eye, the siriasis of\r\nchildren, earache, the fluor albus, &c. The second, he says, resembles\r\nthe first in virtue. The third, he says, has the same powers as the\r\njuice of the poppy. The fourth brings on phantasies and delirium, and in\r\nlarge doses proves fatal. The best counter-agent to it is undiluted wine\r\ndrunk and afterwards vomited. (iv, 72-5.) Celsus frequently prescribes\r\n“solanum quam στρύχνον Græci vocant,” and ranks it among those things\r\nwhich repress and soothe. (ii, 33.) He recommends it as an application\r\nin phrenitis and various other diseases. (iii, 18.) Galen and Aëtius\r\ngive nearly the same account of it as our author. Oribasius confessedly\r\nborrows his description from Dioscorides. The Arabians treat fully of the\r\nsolanum, of which Avicenna mentions that there are five species. (ii,\r\n2, 646.) See Serapion (De Simpl. 138); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 662);\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 212.) The characters which\r\nthey give of these plants agree in the main so well with those given to\r\nthem by the Greeks, that we need not stop to note slight differences. The\r\nLatin writers of the middle ages call solanum by the name of maurella.\r\nSee Macer Floridus. He says of the strychnos that it is possessed of\r\npowerfully narcotic properties. The Solanum nigrum held a place in our\r\nDispensatories, and retained the characters transmitted down with it from\r\nantiquity as late as the end of the last century. See Lewis (M. M.) All\r\nour old herbalists, Gerard, Parkinson, and Culpeper, speak of its virtues\r\nin the same terms as Dioscorides. Our toxicologists have decided that it\r\nis a powerful narcotic. See Orfila. The _Physalis somnifera_ is still\r\nused in India as an application to inflammatory tumours. See Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 621.) The _alkekengi_ is still admitted to be possessed of\r\na diuretic power, as stated by Dioscorides. (Ibid.) We are not aware\r\nof the Solanum Sodomæum having ever been used medicinally in modern\r\ntimes, but we need scarcely say that of late years the Atropa Belladonna\r\nhas occupied no undistinguished place in our Dispensatories. On the\r\n_Strychnos furiosa_ as a poison, see Vol. II, p. 224.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτυπτηρία,\r\n\r\nAlumen, _Alum_; all kinds of it are very sour, and consist of gross\r\nparticles. But the alumen scissile, or _Stone Alum_, consists of more\r\nsubtile parts than the others. After it is the Alumen rotundum, or _Round\r\nAlum_, and the astragolotum. The Alumen liquidum, or _Liquid Alum_,\r\nconsists of gross parts; and so also the varieties called placitis and\r\nplinthitis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. After having read much that has been written by the best\r\nauthorities both ancient and modern upon this subject, we still approach\r\nthe discussion of it with very great diffidence. Having deliberately\r\nconsidered what Beckmann has written regarding the ancient alum, we\r\ncannot agree with him in setting it down as being copperas or the green\r\nsulphate of iron. The ancients, indeed, may not always distinguish\r\naccurately the latter from “the sulphate of alum and potash,” but\r\nconsidering how common this mineral is in the countries bordering upon\r\nthe Mediterranean, we cannot conceive how the ancients could possibly\r\nhave remained ignorant of it, and we need scarcely add that it has never\r\nbeen pretended that _it_ has been described by them under any other\r\nname. But its varieties differed much from one another. The Alumen\r\nplumosum, called τριχῖτις by the Greeks, was no doubt the _Hair salt_ of\r\nWerner, which, according to the analysis of Klaproth, contains a large\r\nmixture of the sulphates of magnesia and iron. Geoffroy remarks that “of\r\nliquid alum two kinds are taken notice of by the ancients; the one pure\r\nand the other impure. The solid or concreted kind was by the ancients\r\ndistinguished, according to the figure of its parts, into fissile and\r\nround. The fissile natural alum was either in form of a compact, uniform\r\nglobe, or appeared divided into small hairs or filaments. The round\r\nkind was of a more rare texture.” The Alumen Jameni of the Arabians\r\nwas the plumose alum. Pliny and Octavius Horatianus recommend alum as\r\nan application to burns when pounded with oil. Alum was used in the\r\npractice of medicine from the earliest times. Hippocrates prescribes\r\nit in ulcers of the womb, diseases of the gums, and for various other\r\npurposes. (Epid. vii, De Mulieb., De Ulcer., &c.) Our author borrows from\r\nGalen. Dioscorides gives a most elaborate description of the different\r\nkinds and of their uses in medicine. They are all possessed, he says,\r\nof a heating power, and also of an astringent, and hence they clear\r\nthe obscurities of the cornea, melt down fungous flesh on the eyelids\r\nand elsewhere, the schistose being more powerful than the round; they\r\nstop mortifications and hemorrhages, repress flaccid gums, strengthen\r\nloose teeth with vinegar or honey; are beneficial in aphthæ; and, in\r\nshort, he states most minutely the various purposes to which alum may be\r\napplied. On the alumen see also Pliny (H. N. xxxv, 52) and Celsus (iv,\r\n18), with the note of Milligan. For the Arabians consult Avicenna (ii,\r\n2, 68); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43); Serapion (De Simpl. 420); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 44); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. 38); Ebn Baithar (ii, 83.) All of\r\nthese authors, even including the last, do little more than copy from\r\nDioscorides and Galen under this head. Geber, however, treats of the\r\nsubject with some appearance of originality, and describes the kinds of\r\nalum with considerable accuracy. (Invention of Verity, c. 4.) The process\r\nof burning alum for medicinal purposes, which is barely alluded to by\r\nDioscorides, is described by Geber and by Servitor. (i.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣτυραξ,\r\n\r\nStorax, is calefacient, emollient, and digestive. It therefore is useful\r\nin coughs, catarrhs, and defluxions; and promotes menstruation both when\r\ndrunk and applied on a pessary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is clearly our officinal storax, or _Styrax officinale_.\r\nDr. Pereira has given the ancient history of this substance so correctly,\r\nas to leave us little further to add under the present head. (Mat.\r\nMed. 931.) As he states, the storax has been described by Hippocrates,\r\nTheophrastus, Pliny, and Dioscorides. The several varieties described by\r\nthe last of these, Dr. Pereira ingeniously refers to kinds of storax,\r\nwith which we are still acquainted. The _Styrax Calamita_ is mentioned\r\nby our author in the eleventh Section; according to him it is but a\r\nvariety of the amygdaloid storax, which was formerly imported enveloped\r\nin a monocotyledonous leaf. Dioscorides’s description of its medicinal\r\nproperties agrees well with our author’s, but is considerably fuller. (i,\r\n79.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat of it like our author.\r\nCelsus prescribes it frequently as an emollient, discutient, concoctive,\r\nand suppurative medicine. (v, 18, 22, c. &c.) The Arabians treat of it\r\nat considerable length, but do not add much of any practical importance\r\nto what had been written on it by Dioscorides and Galen. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 423); Serapion (c. 46); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 687); Ebn Baithar (ii, 428.) Upon the whole, Serapion’s\r\naccount appears to us most interesting. His Arabian authority, Isaac Eben\r\nAmram, mentions that it was used by the Christians in their churches for\r\nfumigations. Avicenna, according to Dr. Hill, is the only one among the\r\nArabians who distinguishes the solid storax, which we have been treating\r\nof from the liquid, or _Styrax liquidus_. It is quite a different\r\nsubstance, being procured from the _Liquid amber orientale_, according to\r\nDr. Lindley. (Veg. King. 253.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣύκα,\r\n\r\nFicus, _Figs_; those which are dried possess heating powers in about the\r\nsecond degree. But those which are fatty rather digest hard tumours;\r\nthose which are more acrid prove detergent and discutient. The decoction\r\nof them, when made of the consistence of honey (which some call siræon),\r\nis similar in powers to honey. The powers of the green are weaker, but\r\nboth loosen the belly. The figs of the wild tree are possessed of acrid\r\nand discutient powers like those of the cultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Book I (s. 81.) Pliny enumerates the medicinal properties\r\nof _figs_ at great length. Ripe figs are said to be diuretic, laxative,\r\nand diaphoretic. Externally they were used as an application to boils\r\nand scrofulous swellings. (H. N. xxiii, 63.) See also Dioscorides and\r\nSerapion, both of whom give the characters of figs in nearly the same\r\nterms as Pliny. No ancient author, however, has treated so elaborately of\r\nfigs as Avicenna (ii, 2, 276.) His account of them is so lengthy that we\r\ndare not venture upon an analysis of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣνκὴ,\r\n\r\nFicus, _the Fig-tree_, is of a heating and attenuating temperament, so\r\nthat the juice of it and the sap of the leaves are not only pungent and\r\nstrongly detergent, but also occasion ulceration, open the mouths of\r\nvessels, and remove myrmecia. It is also cathartic. The wild-fig, called\r\ncaprificus, is in every respect more powerful than the cultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See the authorities referred to in the preceding article.\r\nPliny recommends the juice of the caprificus or wild fig-tree (_Ficus\r\nCarica_), as an application to leprosy, psora, and lichen. All the\r\nauthorities, Greek, Latin, and Arabian, praise it as an application\r\nto the wounds of venomous animals. The wild fig-tree is the Ἐρίνεος\r\nof Homer. V. Eustath. ‘Comment. in Iliad.’ (vi, 433.) The commentator\r\ndescribes accurately the process of caprification.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣυκόμορος,\r\n\r\nSycomorus, _the Sycomore_; the fruit is innutritive, and bad for\r\nthe stomach. The juice of the tree has powers which are emollient,\r\nagglutinative of wounds, and discutient of tumours. It is taken in a\r\ndraught and rubbed in for the bites of reptiles, for scirrhous spleens,\r\npains of the stomach, and rigors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Of course there can be no doubt of its being the _Ficus\r\nSycomorus_. Galen, Dioscorides, and Serapion detail its medicinal\r\nproperties in nearly the same terms as our author. Nothing else of any\r\ninterest can be gathered from the others under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣύμφυτον,\r\n\r\nSymphytum, _Comfrey_; the rock comfrey is composed of opposite powers.\r\nFor it has some incisive powers by which it cleanses the pus in the chest\r\nand the kidneys; and it has also some constringency which renders it a\r\nsuitable remedy for hæmoptysis, sprained and ruptured parts, the red flux\r\nin women, and intestinal hernia. It contains also some hot humidity, by\r\nwhich it quenches thirst and cures asperities in the trachea. The other\r\nspecies, called the _Great Comfrey_, is glutinous and prurient like\r\nsquills. It is used for the same purposes as the rock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The second species is indisputably the _Symphytum\r\nofficinale_, a plant which the Romans, no doubt, naturalized in this\r\ncountry. The other has been the subject of more controversy. See\r\nParkinson (526) and Matthiolus and Sprengel (Ad Dioscor. iv, 9.) We are\r\nsatisfied that it was the _Coris monspeliensis_. Our author manifestly\r\nabridges Galen, who borrows from Dioscorides, but improves what he\r\ntakes. They all agree in commending both as being possessed of great\r\nvirtues as expectorant and vulnerary medicines. Dioscorides particularly\r\ncommends the latter as an application to inflammations about the anus\r\nin a cataplasm, with the leaves of senecio. Neither of these plants is\r\nmentioned by Celsus, nor, we believe, by Hippocrates. Avicenna writes\r\nhesitatingly about them, but in the main agrees with Dioscorides with\r\nregard to their medicinal virtues, more especially in hæmoptysis, ulcers\r\nof the intestines, menorrhagia, and as an application to external\r\ninjuries. (ii, 2, 634.) The Arabians in general seem not to have attached\r\nmuch importance to the symphytum, for, after a cursory examination while\r\nwriting this article, we have not been able to find it in any of the\r\nothers except Ebn Baithar, who merely gives extracts from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen, under the present head. Apuleius mentions that the Latin name\r\nof the symphytum is consolida. Dr. Hill calls it a famous vulnerary both\r\ninternally and externally, and as such it is highly commended by all our\r\nolder herbalists. See Parkinson, Culpeper, and Gerard. It would appear\r\nalso that the other species, the Coris monspeliensis, was employed in the\r\nmedicine of the Spanish monastic orders as an efficacious vulnerary. See\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 645.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΣφονδύλιον,\r\n\r\nSpondylium, _Cow-parsnip_; the fruit and root are possessed of acrid and\r\ncutting powers, so as to cure asthma, epilepsy, and jaundice. The root,\r\nwhen stripped of its bark and put into a fistula, removes its callus. The\r\njuice of the flowers of it are injected into the ears as agreeing with\r\nchronic ulcers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems no reason to doubt of its being the _Heracleum\r\nSphondylium_. Dioscorides and Pliny recommend it as an application to\r\nfistulous ulcers, and in the other cases mentioned by our author. Galen\r\nand Oribasius give it the same characters as our author. We have not\r\nmet with it in the works of Hippocrates, Celsus, and Aëtius. Avicenna\r\ndraws the characters which he gives it entirely from Dioscorides. (ii,\r\n2, 643.) Ebn Baithar, in describing it, merely gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (ii, 24.) Rhases does the same. (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n636.) The sphondylium is described as a medicinal herb, possessed of the\r\nvirtues ascribed to it by the ancients, in the works of our old English\r\nherbalists, but it has long ceased to occupy a place in our Dispensatory.\r\nNeither is it to be found in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣχῖνος,\r\n\r\nLentiscus, _the Lentisk_, in all its parts, belongs to the full second\r\norder of desiccants. As to heating and cooling, it holds an intermediate\r\nplace. It is astringent to such a degree as to approach nearly, in this\r\nrespect, to the juice of the hypocistis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Pistacia Lentiscus_, L., according to the\r\nadmission of all the commentators. We need scarcely mention that it is\r\nthe tree from which mastich is procured. Hippocrates was well acquainted\r\nwith the medical use of it. Pliny says that it acts as a diuretic, but\r\noccasions constipation of the bowels. He also mentions that it was used\r\nin toothache, and that a decoction of its leaves in a gargle fastened\r\nloose teeth. (xxiv, 28.) The same is stated of it by Plinius Valerianus\r\n(i, 36), and by Dioscorides (i, 89.) Nay, it would appear, from the\r\nfollowing epigram of Martial, that peculiar virtues were ascribed to a\r\ntoothpick made of the mastich tree:\r\n\r\n                “Dentiscalpium\r\n    Lentiscum melius: sed si tibi frondea cuspis\r\n      Defuerit, dentes penna levare potest.”—(xiv, 22.)\r\n\r\nDioscorides is the author who has written most elaborately on this\r\narticle, which he recommends in hæmoptysis, diarrhœa, dysentery,\r\nmenorrhagia, prolapsus uteri and ani, in affections of the mouth, as\r\nalready stated, and, in a word, he concludes by saying of its oil, that\r\nit is beneficial in all cases requiring astringency. (l. c.) Galen also\r\ngives a very sensible account of this tree, which he represents to be\r\nan astringent of the same class as hypocistis. Celsus prescribes it on\r\nvarious occasions, as, for example, a decoction of its leaves to suppress\r\nimmoderate suppuration. (vi, 18.) He ranks it among the astringent and\r\nemollient substances. (ii, 33.) All the Arabians treat largely of it,\r\nbut copy most of their information from Dioscorides and Galen. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 453); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 457); Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n159); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (ii, 518.) In particular\r\nall recommend it as a dentifrice and odontalgic, and we need scarcely\r\nmention that it still is used in the East for these purposes. See Paris\r\n(Pharm. t. ii, 323) and Pereira (1184.) It is stated in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia that it is cultivated in Chios.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣχοῖνος,\r\n\r\nJuncus, _the Rush_; its flower is moderately calefacient, but astringent\r\nin a less degree, and is not removed from the nature of attenuating\r\nsubstances. Hence it is diuretic, emmenagogue, and deobstruent in\r\nfomentations, potions, and cataplasms. The root of it is more astringent,\r\nbut the flower hotter. The marsh-rush consists of two varieties. The\r\nfruit of the oxyschœnus or _Hard-rush_, as it is called, is soporific,\r\nbut that of the holoschœnus less so, and it also occasions headache. Both\r\nvarieties, if toasted and drunk with wine, dry up fluxes of the belly and\r\nrestrain the female discharge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It requires some attention not to confound the _Schœni_\r\nwith one another. The _Schœnanthus_, then, is decidedly the _Andropogon\r\nSchœnanthus_, or Lemon-grass. See Dr. Royle (Antiq. of Hindoo Med. 82)\r\nand Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 113.) The σ. ἐλεῖα is the _Schœnus Holoschœnus_;\r\nthe ὁλοσχοῖνος, the _Schœnus mariscus_; and the ὀξυσχοῖνος, the _Juncus\r\nacutus_. The first of these is the species most celebrated as a medicine.\r\nThus it is the schœnus of Dioscorides, who represents it as being\r\nuseful in vomiting of blood, pains of the stomach, lungs, liver, and\r\nkidneys, and as being possessed of diuretic, emmenagogue, carminative,\r\nsubastringent, and other powers. Its decoction, he says, is useful as a\r\nhip-bath in inflammations of the womb. (i, 16.) Galen gives a similar\r\naccount of its virtues. (De Simpl. viii, and De Antidot. i.) The other\r\nGreek authorities treat of it very succinctly. Is not this the “flos\r\njunci rotundi” of Celsus? (v, 24.) According to Dierbach and, indeed, all\r\nthe best authorities, it is the σ. ἔυοσμος of Hippocrates (De Mulieb.\r\ni, 111), who recommends it along with other aromatics in diseases of\r\nthe uterus. The Arabians display an intimate acquaintance with the\r\nschœnanths. See Avicenna (ii, 2); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 681); Serapion\r\n(De Simpl. 103); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (i, 19.) The\r\nlast of these gives a particularly full account of it, mostly from\r\nArabian authorities. They all agree in representing it as being diuretic,\r\nemmenagogue, and alexipharmic, and in recommending it particularly in\r\napostemes of the anus, and in scabies. Its oil, they say, is efficacious\r\nin removing lassitude. The schœnanth held a place in our Dispensatory\r\nas late as the times of Quincy (i, 1, 12) and Lewis (ii, 20.) Upon\r\nconsulting the modern authors quoted above, it will be seen that it is\r\nstill well known in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nΣῶρι,\r\n\r\nSori, resembles misy in its powers, consisting of much grosser particles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We feel that we must still add something to what we have said\r\nof this substance under the head of _Misy_. The following description of\r\nit, by a great modern authority, who appears to have been well acquainted\r\nwith it, deserves not to be overlooked: “Rusma _or_ Sory. A mixt mineral,\r\nblackish, hard, heavy, and of a cavernous or spongy structure, of a\r\ndisagreeable smell, and nauseous, vitriolic taste; and often covered with\r\ndusty efflorescences on the surface. It is composed of vitriol, sulphur,\r\nand an earthy matter. The ancients called it _sory_. We have it in our\r\nDerbyshire mines, but it is not regarded. It was used as a depilatory\r\nby the Greeks, and is so by the Turks at this time. Taken inwardly it\r\nvomits instantaneously and very roughly; it contains a cupreous vitriol,\r\nand hence its emetic quality.”—Boerhaave’s Materia Medica, translated\r\nby Goade (227.) See under _Chalcitis_. Dioscorides calls it blackish,\r\nfetid, and nauseating, and possessed of caustic powers: he recommends\r\nit in toothache, as an application to vari, as an injection with wine\r\nin sciatica, &c. (v, 118.) Galen says it is not soluble like misy and\r\nchalcitis, but does not materially differ from them in medicinal powers.\r\nCelsus prescribes it along with opium, pepper, and galbanum as a stuffing\r\nto carious teeth. (vi, 9.) Avicenna, like Galen, says it is insoluble in\r\nwater, and, like Dioscorides, he prescribes it in sciatica and diseases\r\nof the teeth. (ii, 2, 47.) We have stated above that Serapion describes\r\nthe sory along with the other two under the general head of _vitriolum_,\r\nand the specific name of _Zeg rubeum_; and that he merely translates\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (c. 386.) Rhases, in like manner, gives from\r\nDioscorides and Galen a description of misy, sory, and chalcitis under\r\nthe general head of _vitriolum_. He calls the sory, vitriolum ruffum,\r\nand, like Dioscorides, recommends it in carious teeth and in sciatica.\r\nHis only Arabian authority, Bimasui, says of the vitriolum that it dries\r\nthe lungs strongly, and in this way may prove fatal. (Cont l. ult. i,\r\n747.) It is the vitriolum rubeum of Averrhoes. (Collig. v, 43.) In the\r\nmost barbarous translation of Haly Abbas it is scarcely possible to\r\nextract any proper meaning from his description of the three vitriols.\r\n(Pract. ii, 48.) The lengthy account which Ebn Baithar gives of them\r\nis mostly made up of extracts from Dioscorides, Galen, and Avicenna.\r\n(ii, 510.) Some have thought the sory of Pliny different from that of\r\nthe others, but, as far as we can see, without any good reason. Like\r\nDioscorides, he recommends it in diseases of the teeth and spreading\r\nulcers of the mouth. He says it is a thing so offensive to the stomach,\r\nthat the very smell of it will sometimes excite vomiting. (H. N. xxxiv,\r\n30.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤάριχοι,\r\n\r\nSalsamenta, _Pickles_; their flesh is possessed of acrid and desiccative\r\npowers. They are given, therefore, to persons bitten by the viper\r\nprester, that they may eat as much as possible, and drink of wine freely,\r\nand vomit. They also are suitable to the regimen of acrid food; and are\r\napplied with advantage to persons bitten by dogs and other reptiles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _Pickled Fish._ It appears from Dioscorides and Xenocrates\r\nthat the tunny (_Scomber Thynnus_) was accounted the best pickle, and it\r\nwas accordingly most used in medical practice. Galen recommends the brine\r\nof pickled fish as an injection in dysentery, and a stimulant lotion to\r\nsores on all parts of the body. Serapion gives the same account of it\r\nas Dioscorides and Galen. Symeon Seth forbids us to eat pickles after\r\nvenesection, as they are apt to occasion alphos and scabies. It seems\r\nhighly probable that indigestible substances, if taken into the stomach\r\nwhen the veins are empty, may be rapidly absorbed, and give rise to the\r\nformation of humours, of which nature may endeavour to free the system by\r\ncasting them forth by the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤαυροκόλλα,\r\n\r\nTaurocolla (called by some Xylocolla), is a glutinous substance made from\r\nthe hides of oxen, and is of considerably detergent powers. Hence, when\r\ndissolved in vinegar, it removes lichen and superficial leprosies; and it\r\nprevents burns from getting inflamed when dissolved in hot water. It is\r\nalso a suitable application for wounds when triturated with oxymel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny says of it, “Glutinum præstantissimum fit ex auribus\r\ntaurorum et genitalibus. Nec quidquam efficacius prodest ambustis.”\r\n(H. N. xxviii, 72.) Dioscorides and Avicenna recommend it in the cases\r\nmentioned by our author. It will readily be perceived that it was a\r\nspecies of gelatin. See Κόλλα.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤελλῖναι,\r\n\r\nTellinæ, _Limpets_; when pickled and burnt, their ashes are caustic; when\r\nmixed with cedar rosin and applied to the parts from which the hairs\r\nof the eyebrows have been torn out by the roots, it prevents them from\r\ngrowing again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Matthiolus, they are a species of mussels. They\r\nare different, however, from the _Mytili edules_, L. Our author’s account\r\nof them is taken from Dioscorides, and is repeated by Avicenna.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤέρμινθος,\r\n\r\nTerebinthus, _Turpentine_, is heating in the second degree, and\r\ndesiccative, when green, in the first, but when dried, in the second.\r\nThe fruit, when dried, belongs to the third order of desiccants. It is,\r\ntherefore, diuretic and useful for the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Pistacia Terebinthus_ L. Dioscorides states\r\nthat its fruit is hot, diuretic, and aphrodisiacal. He recommends it\r\ninternally for the bites of the phalangia. Of the turpentine resin we\r\nhave treated under the head of the Resinæ. The ancients, as we have\r\nstated, were very familiar with the _brown_ or _black_ rosin, called\r\n_colophony_. (i, 91.) According to Dr. Hill, the Chian turpentine rosin\r\nwas the turpentine of the ancients. Pliny likewise recommends it in\r\nretention of urine, and as a gentle laxative. He adds, “venerem excitat.”\r\n(H. N. xxiv, 18.) Our author’s account of it is condensed from Galen. The\r\nturpentines, and more especially the resin, are frequently prescribed\r\nby Celsus. They occur also in the Hippocratic treatises. Turpentine\r\nwas much used in applications to cutaneous diseases and ulcers. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 303) and Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 342.) Serapion treats\r\nof this article under the same head with the lentiscus. He copies from\r\nDioscorides. (De Simpl. 153.) See Ebn Baithar (ii, 144.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤέττιγες,\r\n\r\nCicadæ; some, having dried them raw, give them to drink in colic\r\naffections to the number of three, five, or seven, with an equal number\r\nof grains of pepper. Others roast them and give them to drink to those\r\nwho have affections of the bladder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The τέττιξ of the Greeks and the cicada of the Romans was\r\nnot the grasshopper, as has been often represented, but the insect which\r\nhas been more properly called the tree-hopper in English, namely the\r\n_cicale_ of the Italians. The species here noticed was most probably the\r\n_Cicada orni_. Dioscorides merely recommends them in diseases of the\r\nbladder. (ii, 56.) Pliny gives a very interesting description of them,\r\nbut it contains nothing which, in a medical point of view, would suit our\r\npresent purpose. (H. N. xi, 32.) Our author follows Galen. (De Simpl.\r\nxi.) They do not occur in the works of Celsus, nor have we been able\r\nto discover traces of them in any of the Arabians, with the exception\r\nof Ebn Baithar, who, in treating of them, merely gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (i, 555.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤεῦτλον,\r\n\r\nBeta, _Beet_, is of a nitrous nature. Hence it is detergent and\r\ndiscutient, and purges by the nose; but especially the white species.\r\nWhen boiled it becomes anti-inflammatory and slightly discutient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It evidently is the _Beta vulgaris_ L. The white and black\r\nkinds were, we presume, merely varieties; but this does not seem\r\nsufficiently clear. See Parkinson (Theatre of Plants, 752) and Lewis\r\n(Mat. Med.) Dioscorides recommends the beet for various medicinal\r\npurposes, for clearing the head by occasioning a discharge from the nose,\r\nas a remedy for earache; a decoction of its leaves for eruptive diseases\r\nand chilblains; and also as an application to exanthemata, burns, and\r\nerysipelas. (ii, 49.) Galen gives the same account of it as our author.\r\nAëtius is fuller; he further recommends it particularly as a deobstruent\r\nin diseases of the liver and spleen. The beet is mentioned as an edible\r\nplant by Hippocrates. (De Vict. Acut.) See also Celsus (ii, 18.) Serapion\r\n(c. 148) and Avicenna recommend the leaves of beet as an application to\r\nburns and impetigo, (ii, 2, 636.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 127.)\r\nAll the authorities say that the beet is possessed of nitrous properties,\r\nby which they probably mean saline, the ancient _nitrum_ being a species\r\nof native soda, resembling salt. It is now well known that beetroot by\r\nboiling yields a saccharine salt in considerable abundance. The beet held\r\na place in our Dispensatory as late as the time of Lewis. We have treated\r\nof it as an article of food in Book I.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤεύκριος,\r\n\r\nTeucrium, _Tree Germander_, is a calefacient of the second order, and a\r\ndesiccant of the third. Its powers are also incisive and subtile, and\r\nhence it cures the spleen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is not well decided whether it be the _Teucrium Marum_\r\nor the _Teucrium flavum_. Pliny’s account of it is very confused, and\r\nHarduin thinks that his T. is the hemionitis of Dioscorides. (Ad H. N.\r\nxxv, 20.) Apuleius, in like manner, identifies the hemionon and the\r\nteucrium. (De Herbis, 56.) Dioscorides, like our author, recommends it\r\nfor reducing the spleen, both when given internally and when applied\r\nexternally in a cataplasm, and also as an application to the bites of\r\nvenomous animals. (iii, 110.) Our author borrows from Galen. We have not\r\nbeen able to discover it in the works either of Hippocrates or of Celsus.\r\nNeither have we found it in the works of the Arabians. Dr. Sontheimer,\r\nthe German translator of Ebn Baithar, identifies the _Teucrium Marum_\r\nwith the _Chamædrys_ of Dioscorides, and the _T. flavum_ with his\r\n_Teucrium_. (ii, 466.) It is long since the _Teucrium Marum_ disappeared\r\nfrom our Dispensatory, but it is still not wholly unknown in the shops\r\nof the apothecaries, where it is reputed to be emmenagogue. The _T.\r\nflavum_ is also to be found in the shops, and has still the reputation\r\nof being useful in diseases of the liver and spleen. See Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 49.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤέφρα,\r\n\r\nCinis, _Ashes_; all kinds have not exactly the same temperament, but they\r\nvary according to the difference of the wood that has been burnt. The\r\nashes, then, of sour things, such as the oak and the ilex, have no small\r\ndegree of astringency, so that they will restrain hemorrhage when no\r\nother remedy is at hand. That from acrid substances, such as the ashes of\r\nthe fig and the spurge, become more acrid and detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. These _Cineres_ were pearlashes, consisting of the carbonate\r\nof potass mixed with various impurities. Galen remarks, that they are the\r\nresidue of vegetable substances which have been burnt, being composed\r\nof contrary qualities, for that they have something terrene in them,\r\nand also something of a fuliginous nature. When, then, they have been\r\ndissolved in water and strained, what remains is terrene and devoid of\r\npungency. Our author borrows from him his particular characters of the\r\ndifferent cineres. They were much used by the ancient physicians as\r\ncaustic and stimulant applications. Rhases says that they possess an\r\nigneous nature, and are useful in dissolving soft tumours. (Ad Mansor.\r\niii, 47.) See also (Cont. l. ult. i, 214.) In the latter work he borrows\r\nprincipally from Galen and our author. Avicenna recommends the ashes of\r\nmezereon in quinsy, and as a stimulant to the sight. The aqua cineris,\r\nhe says, is one of the septic medicines. (ii, 2, 188.) The burnt lees of\r\nwine belong to this class. See Κονία and Τρῦξ ὄινου.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤηλέφιον,\r\n\r\nTelephium, _Orpine_, is a calefacient of the first order, but a desiccant\r\nof the second. It is also detergent; and hence it is a suitable\r\napplication to putrid ulcers, and cures leuce and alphos with vinegar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We think with Sibthorp and Sprengel, that it is _not_ the\r\n_Sedum Telephium_, but the _Cerinthe minor_. See also Parkinson (520.)\r\nDioscorides recommends it principally in the forms of leprosy. (ii, 217.)\r\nGalen’s characters of it agree with those of our author. It does not\r\noccur in the works either of Hippocrates or of Celsus, neither have we\r\nbeen able to observe any distinct traces of it in those of the Arabians,\r\nunless, which seems highly probable, it be the _thelopium_ of Ebn\r\nBaithar, as his German translator conjectures. (ii. 164.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤῆλις,\r\n\r\nFœnum Græcum, _Fenugreek_, is heating in the second order, but\r\ndesiccative in the first; hence it expedites the progress of all hot\r\nphlegmons; and those which are less hot, and such as are scirrhous, it\r\ncures by discussing them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Trigonella Fœnum Græcum_. It occurs\r\nin the works of Hippocrates. (De Mulieb. i, 617.) It is, unquestionably,\r\nthe “Fœnum Græcum” of Celsus, who enumerates it as an ingredient in an\r\nemollient pessary (v, 21), and in a soothing cataplasm. (ii, 33.) It\r\nis prescribed repeatedly by Aretæus, both internally and externally.\r\nDioscorides recommends the powder of it in the form of a cataplasm to\r\nvarious inflammations, both internal and external; as an ingredient in\r\na medicated bath for diseases of the female organs, and as a pessary in\r\nthe same, an injection of its decoction for tenesmus and fetid discharges\r\nfrom the bowels, and for other purposes. (ii, 125.) Pliny gives a full\r\naccount of its medicinal virtues, in which a considerable portion but\r\nnot the whole is derived from Dioscorides. He says that Damon gave its\r\nseeds in a draught to promote menstruation. He also mentions its being\r\ntaken in ulceration of the chest and chronic coughs. (xxiv, 120.) Galen,\r\nAëtius, and Oribasius give its characters in nearly the same terms as\r\nour author. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 246); Serapion (De\r\nSimpl.); Rhases (Cont l. ult. i, 294); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 333.) Though these authors, and especially Avicenna, treat\r\nat great length of this article, it does not appear that they applied\r\nit in many more cases than as they had been taught by the Greeks. They\r\nrecommend it, however, with oil of roses, as an application to burns,\r\nand as an ingredient in collyria. They say the oil of it cures fetor of\r\nthe breath and the perspiration, and of the alvine discharges. They all\r\ncommend it as being diuretic, emmenagogue, and promoting impregnation.\r\nThey further represent it as being an excellent expectorant in diseases\r\nof the chest. Upon reference to Quincy (i, 4, 219), it will be seen that\r\nin his time the fenugreek still maintained the characters assigned to it\r\nby the ancient authorities. It has now disappeared from our Dispensatory,\r\nbut is still retained in the Greek Pharmacopœia. (Athens, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤιθύμαλλοι,\r\n\r\nTithymalli, _Spurges_; all the species of it are of the fourth order of\r\ncalefacients, with acrimony and strong bitterness; but the root being\r\nweaker, when boiled with vinegar, allays the pains of carious teeth.\r\nThe juices being stronger are applied to the hollow of teeth; but if\r\nthey touch the rest of the body they burn it; and therefore they remove\r\nthe hairs if rubbed in for a short time. They also remove myrmecia,\r\nacrochordones, and the like, and clear away affections of the skin, and\r\ncure ill-conditioned and phagedænic ulcers. There being seven species\r\nof this plant, the strongest are the Characias (_Wood Spurge_), and\r\nthe Myrsinitis (_Myrtle-leaved Spurge_), and that growing upon rocks,\r\nArboreus (_Tree Spurge_); but next in order are, that species which\r\nresembles Pettymullein (_Broad-leaved Spurge_), and the Cyparissias\r\n(_Cypress Spurge_), and then the Maritimus (_Sea Spurge_), and the\r\nHelioscopius (_Sun Spurge_ or _Wartwort_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the Tithymalli of the ancients are all referable to the\r\ngenus _Euphorbia_ or _Spurge_, cannot admit of any doubt. Dioscorides,\r\nPliny, Apuleius, and, in a word, most of the ancient authorities, like\r\nour Paulus, describe seven medicinal species, to which we may venture to\r\ngive the following names in the botanical nomenclature of the present\r\ntime. 1. _Euphorbia characias._ 2. _E. myrsinites._ 3. _E. paralias._\r\n4. _E. helioscopia._ 5. _E. cyparissias._ 6. _E. dendroides._ 7. _E.\r\nplatyphyllos._ See Sprengel (Ad Dioscor.); Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 277);\r\nGerman Translation of Ebn Baithar (ii, 525); Miller (Gard. Dict.) Besides\r\nthese, the medical authors treat of several other species of spurge by\r\nparticular names, as lathyris, peplis, thymelæa, &c. The tithymallus was\r\ncalled “lactuca marina” by the Romans (Celsus v, 7), and also “lactaria”\r\nand “lactuca caprina.” See Pliny, who gives a full account of the\r\nspurges. (H. N. xxvi, 39, 46.) These plants are treated of at so great a\r\nlength by Dioscorides and the other authorities, that we cannot possibly\r\nfind space for an exposition of their particular views. All, however,\r\nagree in giving them nearly the same characters as our author, who, in\r\nthe present instance, is indebted in part to Dioscorides, and in part to\r\nGalen. Several of them are noticed by Hippocrates. For the Arabians, see\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 360); Avicenna (ii, 2, 421); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n718); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (l. c.) They recommend them\r\nin the same cases as the Greeks, without supplying any new views of much\r\nimportance. They prescribe a few drops of the juice of spurge poured upon\r\na fig as a phlegmagogue. They further recommend them in malignant ulcers\r\nand those attended with caries of the bones. And here, by the way, we may\r\nbe allowed to mention that a modern authority confirms what the ancients\r\nsay of the efficacy of the spurges in this case. Sec Hildanus (x, c. ii,\r\n2.) In the present age, we have discarded such purgatives as the spurges,\r\nwhether wisely or not we will not take upon ourselves to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤίτανος,\r\n\r\nCalx, Lime; the Calx viva (_Quicklime_) burns strongly so as to form\r\neschars; when slacked, it forms eschars at first, but not so after some\r\ndays. It contracts, however, and wastes the flesh. When washed it loses\r\nit pungency, if this is often done with water; but if in sea-water, it\r\nbecomes decidedly detergent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears from Dioscorides that the _Lime_ used by the\r\nancient physicians, was prepared by calcination from shells, pebbles, or\r\nmarble, which last is the best of all. Pliny, Vitruvius, and Palladius\r\nsay, that the best lime is got from hard, white stone. Lime was much used\r\nas a caustic and stimulant application. The Ἄσβεστος of the Greek Mat.\r\nMed. invariably, we believe, signifies quicklime, and is never applied\r\nto the mineral which now bears that name. Dioscorides says, all kinds\r\nof quicklime have a fiery, biting, caustic, and escharotic power; when\r\nmixed with other things as suet or oil, it becomes digestive, emollient,\r\ndepilatory, and epulotic; and that which is recent and free from water\r\nis more efficacious. (v, 132.) Pliny recommends it in the same cases,\r\nand also as an application to luxations and strumæ. (H. N. xxxvi, 57.)\r\nSee also Plinius Valerianus (iii, 20.) Celsus places it in his list of\r\ncorrosive and caustic substances. (v, 6, 8.) Our author’s account of\r\nthis article is condensed from Galen. Aëtius and Oribasius give nearly\r\nthe same account of it as Dioscorides and Galen. Quicklime was used as\r\na medicine in the Hippocratic age. (See Erotianus.) For the Arabians,\r\nconsult Avicenna (ii, 2, 144); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. iii, 20, i, 445);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 412); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 44); Averrhoes (Collig.\r\nv, 43); Ebn Baithar (ii, 387.) All these authorities, including even the\r\nlast, who is by far the most original of their writers on the Mat. Med.,\r\nborrow under this head almost all their information from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. Avicenna praises it as an application to burns.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤραγακάνθα,\r\n\r\nTragacantha, _Tragacanth_, has similar powers to gum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The ancient Tragacanth was identical with the modern, which\r\nis yielded by _Astragalus verus_, and similar spiny species. See Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 548.) According to Sibthorp, the _Astragalus aristatus_ is\r\nthe one which most commonly grows in the Peleponnesus, and he holds that\r\nit produces the T. of Dioscorides. (Prod. Fl. Græc. ii, 90.) Dioscorides,\r\nlike our author, states, that in virtue it resembles gum, and recommends\r\nit in ophthalmic remedies, for roughness of the windpipe, loss of speech,\r\nand epistaxis, in a linctus with honey. He also recommends it when\r\nallowed to melt below the tongue, for pain of the kidneys and bladder,\r\nwhen mixed with hartshorn burnt and washed, and a little fissile alum.\r\n(iii, 20.) Galen and the other Greek authorities state its virtues in\r\nvery general terms. It is an ingredient in more than one of the collyria\r\nof Celsus (vi, 6), and is prescribed by him for various other purposes.\r\nOf the Arabians, Ebn Baithar is the one who gives the fullest account\r\nof it. (ii, 350.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 220.) In the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia the _Astragalus aristatus_ is described as producing the\r\ntragacanth. It is there said to be common in the Peleponnesus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤράγιον,\r\n\r\nTragium, _Stinking St. John’s Wort_, is a plant in Crete resembling the\r\nlentisk, being hot in the third degree, and possessed of attractive,\r\ndiscutient, and attenuant powers. It extracts sharp-pointed weapons of\r\nwood, and proves lithontriptic and emmenagogue when drunk to the amount\r\nof a drachm. Another species, which is bitterer than this, resembling the\r\nceterach, grows everywhere. It is sufficiently astringent so as to agree\r\nwith fluxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From the description which Dioscorides gives of the former\r\nspecies, we need have little hesitation in setting it down for the\r\n_Hypericum hircinum_. In the other, the name _Tragium Columnæ_ has been\r\nassigned from the name of a celebrated botanist. Dioscorides and Galen\r\nascribe to it very nearly the same virtues as our author. Neither of\r\nthese plants occurs in the works of Hippocrates or Celsus. Neither have\r\nwe been successful in searching for it in the works of the Arabians, with\r\nthe exception of those of Ebn Baithar, who merely gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen under this head. (ii, 155.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤραγορίγανος,\r\n\r\nTragoriganon, has powers resembling marjoram, with the addition of some\r\nastringency.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The two species described by Dioscorides probably are the\r\n_Thymus Tragoriganum_ L., and the _Stachys glutinosa_. According to him,\r\nthey are heating, diuretic, and wholesome when the decoction is drunk;\r\nthey occasion bilious dejections; are useful in diseases of the spleen\r\nwhen taken with vinegar, and also to persons who have swallowed ixia.\r\nThey are emmenagogue, and are given in coughs and pneumonia in a linctus\r\nwith honey. It makes an agreeable potion, and hence is given to persons\r\naffected with nausea, indigestion, and acid eructations, and who are\r\nsubject to anxiety, nausea, and heat of the hypochondria. In a cataplasm\r\nwith polenta they also discuss tumours. (iii, 32.) Galen and the other\r\nGreek authorities treat of it very briefly. Celsus calls it diuretic and\r\ndiscutient. (iii, 21, &c.) We have not been able to find these plants in\r\nthe works of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρίβολος,\r\n\r\nTribolus, _the Caltrop_, is moderately refrigerant; the land species is\r\nstrongly desiccative, but the water slightly so, and it is moistening.\r\nBoth are befitting remedies in incipient inflammations and other\r\ninfluxes. The fruit of the land caltrop, consisting of subtile parts,\r\nbreaks renal calculi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It seems to be clearly made out that the one is the _Tribulus\r\nterrestris_, and the other the _Trapa natans_. According to Pliny,\r\ntheir juices are anti-inflammatory, and form a proper application to\r\nphlegmons and ulcers; an ingredient in collyria; discuss strumæ, and\r\nprove lithontriptic. (H. N. xxii, 12.) He borrows this account of them,\r\nhowever, mostly from Dioscorides. (iv, 15.) Our author manifestly copies\r\nfrom Galen, and both Aëtius and Oribasius do the same. We have not found\r\nthem in the works of Hippocrates and Celsus. The Arabians treat of\r\nthem at more length than the Greeks. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 382); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 721); Serapion (c. 112); Ebn Baithar (i, 307.) They\r\nrecommend both species as being aphrodisiac, lithontriptic, and diuretic.\r\nBoth the species here described, that is to say, the _Trapa natans_ and\r\n_Tribulus terrestris_, although they have been long excluded from our\r\nDispensatories, are still not wholly unknown in the shops. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to Pharm. 81, 117.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤράγος,\r\n\r\nTragus, a species of Frumentacea, is like far (spelt), but more\r\nindigestible and laxative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The method of preparing it is thus described in the\r\nGeoponica. Spelt is to be steeped and stripped of its hull, and dried\r\nin the warm sun; then the same thing is to be done until the skin and\r\nfibrous part of the grain drop off. (Geop. iii, 8.) Pliny, however,\r\nseems to make it a peculiar species of grain. “Far sine arista est:\r\nitem siligo. Adjiciuntur his genera, bromos, siligo excepta, et tragos,\r\nexterna omnia ab Oriente invecta, oryzæ similia.” (H. N. xviii, 20.)\r\nGalen and Oribasius call it spelt deprived of the hull. Dioscorides\r\nalso describes a shrub of this name, which there can be no doubt is the\r\n_Ephedra distachya_. He describes it as being very styptic to the taste,\r\nand recommends it in cæliac affections and in fluor albus. (iv, 51.) It\r\nappears singular that none of the other authorities, as far as we can\r\ndiscover, has noticed it, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely\r\ngives a translation of the chapter of Dioscorides on it. (ii, 156.) The\r\nAsiatic _Ephedras_ were formerly kept in the shops as styptics. See\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 234.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρίγλα,\r\n\r\nTrigla, the fish _Surmullet_, when frequently eaten, occasions dimness\r\nof vision. When cut in pieces and applied raw, it cures the bite of the\r\nsea-dragon, of the scorpion, and of the spider.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Mullus barbatus_ L. According to Coray (Ad\r\nXenocrat.), it is the _Surmullet_. R. Stephens likewise calls it by\r\nthis name. It is the “Barbatulus mullus” of Cicero. (Paradox, v,\r\n2.) We have treated of it as an article of food in the First Book.\r\nDioscorides, Galen, and all the authorities that notice it, give it the\r\nsame characters in a medicine as our author. It does not appear that the\r\nArabians describe it.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤριπόλιον,\r\n\r\nTripolium; the root is hot in the third degree and acrid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall have an opportunity in our Appendix to discuss the\r\nquestion, whether or not this be the Turpeth of the Arabians, as has\r\nbeen often stated. We may just mention in this place, that Sprengel is\r\ninclined to refer it to the _Plumbago Europæa_, a plant which seems to\r\nagree very well with the characters of the present article, inasmuch as\r\nits root is peculiarly acrid. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 641.) Dioscorides\r\nsays of it, that its root is hot to the taste, and that when drunk with\r\nwine it discharges water and urine from the belly, and that it is used\r\nas an alexipharmic. (iv, 133.) Galen and the other Greek authorities call\r\nit acrid to the taste and hot in the third degree. For the reason already\r\nstated we shall not enter upon an exposition of the views of the Arabians\r\nin this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρίχες,\r\n\r\nPili, _Hairs_, when burnt have similar powers to burnt wool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author follows Galen. The Arabians recommend burnt hairs\r\nas an application to foul ulcers, and the bite of a mad dog. See Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 191), and Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 52, 552.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρυγων θαλασσίη,\r\n\r\nPastinaca marina; its sting when pressed upon a weak tooth breaks it, and\r\nmakes it fall out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of the _Pastinaca marina_ in Book V.\r\nScarifications of the gums with the sting of this fish in cases of\r\ndifficult dentition are recommended by Marcellus Sideta and Pliny (H. N.\r\nxxxii, 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρὺχ ὄινου,\r\n\r\nFæx Vini, _the Lees of Wine_, when unburnt is compounded, being decidedly\r\ndesiccative and discutient. But astringency is superadded according to\r\nthe species of wine from which it is formed. It is, therefore, to be\r\nused in complaints of a humid nature and fluxes. It discusses phygethla,\r\nand extinguishes the milk in over-distended breasts. The burnt lees\r\nbecome caustic, so as often to be mixed with caustic applications. It,\r\ntherefore, removes leprous nails with rosin, and dyes the hair yellow,\r\nwhen rubbed for a whole night with oil of lentisk. When washed it is used\r\nas an ingredient in the detergent remedies of the eyes; that of vinegar\r\nis stronger in every respect than the lees of wine, and more astringent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The lees of wine and of vinegar are strong preparations of\r\npotass, and were among the most powerful caustics with which the ancients\r\nwere acquainted. Hence Celsus ranks “fæx combusta” among the “adurentia.”\r\n(v, 8.) Dioscorides is the ancient author who gives the fullest\r\ndescription of this article. He says the best is that procured from old\r\nItalian wine, or, failing it, from any similar wine; and that the fæx\r\naceti is possessed of intense powers. Some, he says, burn it upon fresh\r\nshells, and some upon heated coals. He says it is possessed of strongly\r\ncaustic, detergent, escharotic, styptic, very septic and desiccative\r\npowers. The fæx, must be used when recent, for it soon evaporates, and\r\nhence it must not be left uncovered, nor without its vessel. It is washed\r\nlike pompholyx. The unburnt, he adds, discusses tumours by itself, and\r\nwith myrtle; when applied as a cataplasm it represses defluxions of the\r\nbelly and stomach; and when applied in like manner to the lower part of\r\nthe abdomen and genitals, it mitigates the female fluor; it dissipates\r\nhard tumours which are not ulcerated; when rubbed in with vinegar, it\r\nrepresses swelled breasts; the burnt with rosin, removes leprous nails;\r\nrubbed in with oil of privet for a whole night, it makes the hairs\r\nyellow; when washed, it is applicable in diseases of the eyes, like\r\nspodos, and thus clears away cicatrices and clouds on the eye. (v, 131.)\r\nPliny recommends it likewise as an application to various cutaneous\r\ndiseases, and complaints of the eyes. He commends it as an antidote\r\nto mushrooms. The lees of vinegar, he says, are more escharotic. Its\r\nstrength, he says, is increased by being burnt. When applied on a tent\r\nit cleans the genital organ of females. (H. N. xxiii, 32.) See in like\r\nmanner Plinius Valer. (iii, 51.) Avicenna directs us to keep the lees\r\nin a close vessel, and not expose them to the air. He says that the fæx\r\naceti is a medicine of great powers, and stronger than any of the others.\r\nIn short, his account of the lees of wine and vinegar is almost entirely\r\nborrowed from Dioscorides (ii, 2, 241.) Rhases, in like manner, copies\r\nfrom Dioscorides and our author. (Cont. l. ult. i, 296.) See Serapion (De\r\nSimpl. 36); Ebn Baithar (i, 419.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤρωγλοδυτης,\r\n\r\nTroglodyta, is _a Sparrow_, the smallest of all birds, with the exception\r\nof the one called regulus; and living principally in hedges. This animal\r\nwhen pickled, and eaten either roasted or raw, breaks down stones in the\r\nkidneys; and its ashes when burnt, if taken in a draught, do the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have mentioned in Book III, that this small species\r\nof sparrow was supposed to possess great powers as a lithontriptic.\r\nDrelincurtius calls it the wren. (Mangeti Bibl. Chirurg. i, 254.) We,\r\nhowever, are inclined to think that it was the _Accentor modularis_ or\r\nhedge-sparrow. Our author, as far as we have been able to discover, is\r\nthe only one of the authorities who has included this animal in the\r\nMateria Medica; but he borrows his description of it from Aëtius, (iii,\r\n3, 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΤυρος,\r\n\r\nCaseus, _Cheese_; that which is new made, and soft, has repellent powers,\r\ncooling gently, so as when applied to agglutinate wounds. That called\r\noxygalactinus acquires slightly discutient powers in addition, and is\r\nmore agglutinative of wounds. Old cheese, especially such as is fatty,\r\nbecomes discutient, so as to be a fit application to tophi in arthritic\r\ncomplaints, particularly along with the decoction of swines’ flesh\r\npickled and fat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _Cheese_\r\nis mostly abridged from Galen. The kind called oxygalactinus is the same,\r\nwe suppose, as the “Caseus acidus cum oxymelite” of Pliny. (H. N. xxviii,\r\n34.) Galen says that it was used about Pergamus; see also Dioscorides\r\n(ii, 79.) According to Avicenna, fresh cheese is a good application to\r\nrecent ulcers, and old cheese to ill-conditioned ulcers. He recommends\r\ncheese with the brine of bacon as a discutient application to arthritic\r\nchalk-stones. He speaks favorably of fresh cheese as an application in\r\nophthalmia. (ii, 2, 123.) He treats more fully of this article than any\r\nother writer on the Mat. Med., with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who\r\ngives a long dissertation on the properties of cheese, both as an article\r\nof food and as a medicine. (i, 239.) Serapion merely gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen. (De Simpl. 157.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙάκινθος,\r\n\r\nHyacinthus, _Hyacinth_; its root being bulbous-shaped belongs to the\r\nfirst order of desiccants and the second of refrigerants. If applied in a\r\ncataplasm with wine, it is believed to keep children long from coming to\r\npuberty. The fruit is gently detergent and astringent. It is, therefore,\r\ngiven in cases of jaundice with wine, being more desiccative but less\r\nrefrigerant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt, as Sprengel and Matthiolus state, it is the\r\n_Hyacinthus orientalis_ L. Pliny, Dioscorides, and Avicenna enumerate its\r\nmedicinal properties nearly in the same terms as our author. They further\r\nrecommend it as a theriac and alexipharmic. It has long been unknown to\r\nBritish Pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nὝαλος,\r\n\r\nVitrum, _Glass_, when pounded and drunk with a thin white wine is said to\r\nbreak down stones in the bladder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Aristophanes, we believe, is the first writer who makes\r\nmention of glass, since the Orphic remains, in which it is noticed, are\r\nnow generally supposed of a later date. In his comedy of “Acharnenses,”\r\nan ambassador from the court of Persia is made to say that he had drunk\r\nundiluted wine out of vessels of glass and gold. (Acharn. l. 74.) In his\r\n“Nubes” he mentions burning mirrors of glass. It is also mentioned in\r\nthe Timæus of Plato. Pliny gives an interesting account of the invention\r\nof glass. (H. N. xxxvi, 65.) Glass appears to have been in common use\r\nabout his time and afterwards, for we find Dioscorides directing to keep\r\ncertain medicines in vessels of glass; and Actuarius recommends to have\r\n_pots-de-chambre_ made of glass in order to facilitate the observations\r\nupon the urine. From a passage in Pliny it would appear that imitations\r\nof the precious stones were commonly made in glass in his time with foil\r\nor the like placed under it. (H. N. xxvii.) On the glass cups of the\r\nancients, see Strabo (xvi); Athen. (xviii, 28, ed. Schw.); and Salmasius.\r\n(Ad Solin. 769.) From the following passage in the works of Lactantius it\r\nappears that glass was used by the ancients in windows: “Manifestius est,\r\nmentem esse, quæ per oculos ea quæ sunt opposita transpiciat quasi per\r\nfenestras perlucente vitro aut speculari lapide obductas.” (De Opificio\r\nDei, 8.) We need scarcely say that glass has been found in the ruins of\r\nPompeii of late much more plenteous than was expected from the ideas\r\nwhich were formerly entertained of its scarcity in ancient times. The\r\nhyalus _or_ vitrum, however, was a term applied to crystal as well as to\r\nglass. By the medical authors, we suppose, it is generally applied to the\r\nformer; for Avicenna says quaintly of vitrum, that it is _among stones_\r\nwhat a fool is among men, that is to say, it is easily made to assume any\r\ncolour, and is easily broken into pieces. This article does not occur in\r\nthe Mat. Med. of Dioscorides. Galen prescribes it medicinally on various\r\noccasions: thus like our author, he says of burnt crystal or glass, that\r\nit is lithontriptic (De Renum Affect.), and recommends the same for\r\ndrying ulcers (De Comp. Med. sec. gen. iv), and also calls it a good\r\ndiuretic (De Simpl. v.) Our author borrows his paragraph on this subject\r\nfrom Aëtius. (ii, 31.) It is never prescribed medicinally by any more of\r\nthe Greek or Roman authorities. It is regularly treated of, however, by\r\nthe Arabians in their systems of the Mat. Med. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 720);\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 382); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 748); Ebn Baithar (i,\r\n723); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 47.) (?) Of these Serapion is the authority\r\nthat treats most fully of this article. He quotes Galen as saying of\r\nit, that it is hot in the fourth degree. He says there are two kinds,\r\nthe sandy and the stony; that when vitrum is set fire to, and a magnet\r\nis mixed up with it, it becomes coagulated owing to its ductility. He\r\nsays of it that it has various colours, as white, like crystal, which\r\nis the colour of the best kind, red, yellow, green, and azure. He then\r\nsays, like Avicenna, that glass is among stones what a fool is among\r\nmen, and so forth. He adds that crystal is a species of glass (vitrum)\r\nwhich is found in a mineral state. As to its medicinal properties, he\r\nsays it is hot in the first degree, and dry in the second; that it\r\nremoves furfures of the head, and is applied to the head and beard as a\r\ndepilatory. When pounded and drunk with wine, it is lithontriptic. One of\r\nhis Arabian authorities, Aben Mesuai, says glass is good for the lungs\r\nand for baldness. Avicenna further recommends it as a dentifrice, and as\r\nan application to remove albugo of the eye, in which case, he adds, the\r\nburnt is most efficacious. There is nothing of any interest further on\r\nwhat is written of it by Rhases, Haly Abbas, and Ebn Baithar (l. c.) We\r\nmay mention in conclusion that although glass has long been excluded from\r\nthe practice of the regular physician, we have often heard of powdered\r\nglass having been used by empirics, and certainly in some cases with\r\ngood effect, to remove opacities of the cornea. See also Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 260.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὝδνα,\r\n\r\nTuber Terræ, _Truffle_, is composed of a very terrene substance, with a\r\nslight degree of attenuating power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of _Truffles_ in the 77th section of Book I.\r\nIt is the _Tuber Cibarium_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\nὙδράργυρος,\r\n\r\nHydrargyrum, _Mercury_, is scarcely used for medical purposes, being\r\ndeleterious. But some having burnt it, so as to reduce it to ashes, and\r\nmixed it with other articles, have given it to drink in cases of colic\r\nand ileus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have given some account of the ancient opinions on this\r\nsubject in Book V. From the statement of our author it will be perceived\r\nthat the Greek physicians made little use of this important article in\r\nthe practice of medicine. Rhases, Avicenna, Haly Abbas, and Serapion\r\nrecommend it as an application for scabies, lice, and malignant ulcers.\r\nAvicenna says the vapour of it induces paralysis, tremblings, spasms, and\r\ncontractions of the limbs. He adds that the vapour of it is destructive\r\nof sight, and brings on fetor of the breath (ii, 2, 46.) Serapion gives\r\nexactly the same account of it. (De Simpl. 385.) See also Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 75); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 48, 501); Ebn Baithar (i, 553.)\r\nGalen admits that he had no experience of it as proving destructive,\r\neither internally or externally. (De Simpl. ix.) It is remarked by Dutens\r\nthat Dioscorides’s description of the method of preparing mercury from\r\ncinnabar is the first account of the process of _distillation_ which we\r\npossess. (v, 70.) Pliny copies the same. (H. N. xxxiii, 8.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙδροπέπερι,\r\n\r\nHydropiper, _Water-pepper_, is a hot herb, but not so much so as pepper.\r\nWhen applied green along with its fruit it discusses hypopia and\r\nscirrhous tumours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Polygonum Hydropiper_, known by the vulgar name\r\nof _Arse-smart_. The other authorities recommend it as a stimulant\r\napplication to discuss tumours and suggillations. See in particular\r\nDioscorides (ii, 190), and Galen (De Simpl. viii.) The Arabians treat of\r\nit succinctly in much the same terms. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 551);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 551.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὝδωρ,\r\n\r\nAqua, _Water_; the best, and that which is unmixed with other matters,\r\nis cooling and diluent by its own proper substance. Having got acquired\r\nheat, as long as it preserves this it heats, but when it becomes cold, it\r\ncools. That which has a certain admixture, such as of natron or bitumen,\r\nacquires the property of the substance which is mixed with it. Rain water\r\nhas some astringency, for which it is mixed with ophthalmic remedies. The\r\nqualities of the best water have been enumerated in Book I.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is fully treated of by us in Book I. See in particular\r\nPliny (H. N. xxxi, 21); Avicenna (ii, 2, 58); and Rhases (Contin. l. ult.\r\ni, 706.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙοσκύαμος,\r\n\r\nHyoscyamus, _Henbane_; that species which has black seed, and that which\r\nhas yellow, are deleterious. The fittest for medicine is that species,\r\nthe seed and flower of which are white, being of the third order of\r\nrefrigerants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes with considerable precision three\r\nspecies of hyoscyamus, deriving their specific differences from the\r\ncolour of the seed, the first being black, the second yellow, and\r\nthe third white. The first two he rejects as being highly dangerous,\r\nby inducing delirium and sleep. The first of these we are inclined\r\nto think must be _Hyoscyamus niger_, a well-known plant, which was\r\nmost probably naturalized in this country by the Romans for medicinal\r\npurposes. The second was probably a variety of it, or _H. aureus_; and\r\nthe third the _H. albus_. He gives minute directions for preparing the\r\njuice of it, which he recommends as an ingredient in anodyne collyria,\r\nfor hot and acrid rheums, earache, and complaints about the uterus;\r\nand with flour for inflammations of the eyes, feet, &c. Its seed, he\r\nsays, is applicable for coughs, catarrhs, defluxions, and pains of the\r\neyes; for menorrhagia, and other hemorrhages, when taken in a draught\r\nwith poppy-seed and hydromel. He recommends it as forming an anodyne\r\ncataplasm, for gout, swelling of the testicles, or swelled mammæ after\r\nparturition. He speaks highly of the leaves in all these cases, and for\r\nevery kind of pain. Three or four leaves, he says, cure the remittent\r\nfever called hepialus. He states that the leaves, if taken internally,\r\nand as had been said, when applied as a clyster, induce mental\r\nalienation. He concludes with stating that the root with vinegar forms\r\na gargle in toothache. (iv, 69.) The hyoscyamus of Hippocrates was no\r\ndoubt the _albus_. See Sprengel and Dierbach. The leaves, the root, the\r\nseed, and the juice of the henbane are all used by Celsus in the practice\r\nof medicine. He gives a formula for a pill consisting of mandragora,\r\nparsley-seed, and seed of henbane, which he says is soporific (v, 25.)\r\nPliny describes confusedly four or five species or varieties of henbane.\r\nHe says not much in favour of any of them as medicines. (H. N. xxxv,\r\n17.) See also Scribonius Largus (c. 181), and Apuleius (c. 4.) Galen\r\nand Aëtius treat of it in nearly the same terms as our author. For the\r\nArabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 348); Serapion (c. 340); Rhases (Cont.\r\nl. ult. i, 377, ii, 380); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Haly Abbas (Pract.\r\nii.) Of these Avicenna is the fullest on this head, and yet he borrows\r\nalmost everything from Dioscorides. Of the three species which they\r\nall describe, he represents the white as being the only one fit to be\r\nused as a medicine. Serapion copies closely from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nThe ancient characters of the several species of henbane are given to\r\nthem by Platearius, and by our old herbalists Parkinson and Gerard. It\r\nis singular that the black henbane has supplanted the white, which was\r\nin common use 200 years ago. See Franciscus de le Boe (xx, 34.) It it\r\nalso worthy of remark, that about 100 years ago the henbane had wholly\r\ndisappeared from the Dispensatory. Thus Quincy does not treat of it at\r\nall, and Lewis represents it as a medicine which had been deservedly\r\nexpelled from practice. In Greece at the present day the white species\r\nis much more common than the black. Both have a place in the Greek\r\nPharmacopœia, published at Athens in 1837 (p. 81.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙπέρικον,\r\n\r\nHypericum, _St. John’s Wort_, consists of two species, the first of\r\nwhich, called Androsæmum or Ascyron, has been treated of. The other is\r\nheating and desiccative, consisting of a subtile substance. Hence the\r\nwhole fruit of it is diuretic and emmenagogue. When applied green along\r\nwith its leaves it cicatrizes wounds. It cures sores when sprinkled dry\r\nupon them. It is also given to drink in ischiatic complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There is some difficulty in determining the species. Sibthorp\r\ndecides in favour of the _Hypericum crispum_. The other authorities,\r\nnamely, Dioscorides, Galen, and Aëtius, give it the same characters as\r\nour author. Celsus recommends it in calculus. (v, 21.) The Arabians in\r\nlike manner commend it as being emmenagogue and diuretic. See Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 371); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Avicenna (ii, 2, 354);\r\nSerapion (c. 267.) Rhases says it is called “herba sancti Joannis,” and\r\nhence the modern term St. John’s wort.\r\n\r\n\r\nὙπήκοον,\r\n\r\nHypecoon, is cooling in the third degree, being nearly like poppy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The _Hypecoum procumbens_ would seem to answer very well with\r\nthe characters of it given by Dioscorides and the other authorities. It\r\nis a genus closely allied to the poppies. The other writers on the Mat.\r\nMed. treat of it in the same brief terms as our author. See Dioscorides\r\n(iv, 68); Ebn Baithar (i, 63.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙπόγλωσσον,\r\n\r\nHypoglosson, is a shrub; the root and juice of it are possessed of\r\nemollient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Ruscus Hypoglossum_. It appears to have been\r\nlittle used. We are not sure that it is mentioned at all by the Arabians,\r\nexcept Ebn Baithar, who copies literally from Dioscorides and Galen (i,\r\n98); and the Greeks all treat of it briefly like our author. Dioscorides\r\nmentions its being used as an amulet in headache; and that its root and\r\njuice formed ingredients in softening plasters. (iv, 130.) It is not even\r\nyet wholly unknown to the shops. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙποκιστὶς,\r\n\r\nHypocistis, is the juice of certain substances like pomegranate-flowers,\r\ngrowing under the roots of the cistus, otherwise called cistharus, being\r\nan active remedy for all cases of defluxions by drying and strengthening\r\nthe parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. _The Undergrowth of the Cistus._ The term is applied both to\r\nthe parasitic plant, which grows on the roots of the _Cistus Ladanifera_,\r\nand also, as is evident from the words of our author, to the inspissated\r\njuice of the same. The plant is the _Cytinus Hypocistis_. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes it accurately, and also the process for preparing the juice\r\nof it. He says it is possessed of the same medicinal powers as acacia;\r\nbut is still more astringent and desiccant, being efficacious in cæliac\r\naffections, dysenteries, hæmoptysis, and the female flux, both when taken\r\nby the mouth, and in clysters. (i, 127.) Galen Aëtius, and the other\r\nGreek authorities state its properties in general terms, like our author.\r\nIt occurs in one of the Hippocratic treatises (De Nat. Mulieb.), and is\r\nset down by Celsus as an ingredient of several of his antidotes, but more\r\nespecially of that most famous one ascribed to Mithridates. (v, 23.)\r\nThe Arabians assign it exactly the same characters as the Greeks. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 111); Serapion (c. 115); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. ii, 754,\r\ni, 108, ii, 119); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) All concur in giving it the\r\ncharacter of being an astringent and tonic medicine, both internally and\r\nexternally. As late as the time of Quincy, the hypocistis continued to\r\noccupy a place in our Dispensatory, and it was retained as an ingredient\r\nin the Theriac of Andromachus _or_ Venice Treacle (as it was latterly\r\ncalled), as long as that once-celebrated composition held a place in\r\nthe Pharmacopœia. See Moses Charras (R. Phar. 114.) It still retains in\r\nthe shops the same character for astringency as it received from the\r\nancients. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 38.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὙπόφαιστον,\r\n\r\nHypophæstum, is a species of thorn used by the fullers, like the\r\nhippophaes. The juice of the head, leaves, and roots of it when dried,\r\nand taken to the extent of three oboli with honeyed water, evacuates\r\nwater and phlegm. It agrees principally with orthopnœa, epilepsy, and\r\naffections of the nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the ἱππόφαιστον of Dioscorides and Pliny. They\r\nrecommend it in epilepsy. Like the whole tribe of carduinæ it is\r\ndifficult to define. Sprengel determines it to be the _Cirsium\r\nstellatum_, Allion. Our author copies its characters from Dioscorides.\r\n(iv, 160.) Few of the other ancient authorities have noticed it and it\r\nhas been completely lost sight of in modern pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nὝσσωπον,\r\n\r\nHyssopum, _Hyssop_, is calefacient and desiccative in the third degree.\r\nIt also consists of subtile particles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Into the much controverted question regarding the hyssopus\r\nof the ancients, it is not our present purpose to enter, and we shall\r\ncontent ourselves in a great measure with giving a brief exposition\r\nof its characters and medicinal virtues as delivered by the Greek,\r\nRoman, and Arabian authorities. It occurs repeatedly in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises, as, for example, at ‘De Diæta’ (ii, 26), where it is said of\r\nit that it is hot and purges pituitous matters. Celsus mentions it in\r\nvarious passages; thus he calls it bad for the stomach (p. 83), says\r\nit is diuretic (p. 86, 172), rouses the senses (86), is hepatic (86),\r\nand useful in coughs (160, ed. Milligan.) The following is an abstract\r\nof Dioscorides’s important chapter on the Hyssop. It is a well-known\r\nherb, of two kinds, for one is the mountain, and the other the garden;\r\nthe best is the Cilician. It has an attenuant and heating power; when\r\nboiled with figs and water and drunk along with honey and rue, it is\r\nuseful in pneumonia, asthma, chronic cough, catarrh, and orthopnœa; it is\r\nanthelminthic, in a linctus with honey; its decoction brings off thick\r\nhumours from the bowels when drunk with oxymel; it is eaten along with\r\ngreen figs pounded for moving the bowels; but it purges more strongly\r\nwhen cress, iris, or hedge-mustard is mixed with it; it improves the\r\ncolour of the skin; it is applied as a cataplasm with figs and natron for\r\naffections of the spleen and dropsy, and with wine for inflammations;\r\nit discusses suggillations when applied with boiling water; it is a\r\nmost excellent gargle in cases of quinsy with the decoction of figs; it\r\nsoothes the pains of toothache when the mouth is rinsed with a decoction\r\nof it, and it dissolves flatus about the ears in the form of steam.\r\n(iii, 27.) Pliny recommends it in angina, asthma, as an application to\r\nsores, and, in a word, he gives it the same characters as Dioscorides\r\ndoes. (H. N. xxvi, 11, et alibi.) Our author and Aëtius copy word for\r\nword from Galen. Galen, however, in other of his works prescribes it for\r\nvarious complaints, as a medicine which purges the head and nose (De\r\nCathars.), is useful in the decline of inflammation of the liver (Meth.\r\nMed. xiii), for discussing tumours (De Arte Cur. ad Glauc. ii), and for\r\nother purposes (Meth. Med. viii.) The Arabians treat of it very fully.\r\nSee Serapion (c. 270); Avicenna (ii, 2, 256); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n758); Mesue (De Simpl. 16); Ebn Baithar (i, 545); Averrhoes (Collig. v,\r\n42.) Avicenna evidently derives his characters of it from Dioscorides; he\r\nrecommends it as a phlegmagogue, vermifuge, a remedy for asthma, chronic\r\ncoughs, &c. One of Serapion’s Arabian authorities, Isaac ebn Amram, calls\r\nit a herb growing in the mountains, having branches in length a cubit\r\nor less, and leaves like marjoram. Another of them recommends it in\r\nhardness and frigidity of the womb, kidneys, bladder, and liver, and as a\r\npurgative which evacuates crude humours. He also copies from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. Rhases and Ebn Baithar follow nearly or altogether the same\r\nauthorities as Serapion. Averrhoes states its characters in general\r\nterms. Mesue, upon the whole, is the most interesting and original of\r\nthe Arabian authorities on the hyssop. He says there are two kinds, the\r\ngarden and the mountain; that the former rises above the ground about\r\nhalf a cubit, and that its leaves are larger than those of thyme, and\r\nits flower is purple; the latter has much smaller leaves, and its stem\r\nis not so round. He states its medicinal virtues with much precision,\r\nrecommending it as a phlegmagogue, in asthma, and other affections of the\r\nchest, and in nearly all the cases mentioned by Dioscorides; and also, he\r\nadds, from personal experience, in epilepsy. Two questions now come to\r\nbe solved: 1st, Is the hyssop of Mesue the same as that of Dioscorides?\r\nWe answer this question, with little hesitation, by saying, we think it\r\nis; Mesue merely defines his plant better, but the agreement of these\r\nauthors as to its medicinal virtues convinces us that both treated of the\r\nsame plant. 2d, Was the hyssop of the ancients, then, the same as our\r\n_Hyssopus officinalis_? With much deference to the many eminent scholars\r\nwho deny this, we hesitatingly answer this question in the affirmative,\r\nfor the two following reasons: first, the medicinal characters of the\r\nancient hyssop, as given by Dioscorides, Mesue, and the other Greek and\r\nArabian authorities, agree with those of the _Hyssopus officinalis_, as\r\ngiven by modern writers on the Materia Medica. See Platearius (de Simpl.\r\nMed.); Tournefort (Mat. Med. 223); Boerhaave (Mat. Med. 148); Alston\r\n(Mat. Med. ii, 152); Hill (Mat. Med. 364); Culpeper (Compl. Herbal.\r\n95); Ainslie (Mat. Ind. i, 177); Rutty (Mat. Med. 145); Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 47.) But, secondly, it is incumbent upon those who deny the\r\nidentity of the ancient and modern hyssop to show when and how the _H.\r\nofficinalis_ came to be substituted for a plant, the characters of which\r\nit now bears. But, further, no competent judge, we believe, will dispute\r\nthat the hyssop must have been brought to Britain, and naturalized here\r\nby the Romans. Is it likely, then, that they would have brought a plant\r\nnot described by their learned men at home, and not the one which had\r\nthe character of being possessed of so many virtues? If, as Sprengel and\r\nothers have maintained, the _Origanum Ægyptiacum_ be the true hyssopus of\r\nthe ancients, why was not _it_ introduced into this country and not the\r\n_Hyssopus officinalis_? Since then the _H. officinalis_ is what our Roman\r\nconquerors brought us for their hyssop, we may be pretty confident that\r\nit truly is the ancient plant, the name of which it bears.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦακόι,\r\n\r\nLentes, Lentils, (?) are desiccants of the second order, being\r\nintermediate as to cooling and heating qualities. They have also some\r\nastringency. They therefore dry the body and bind the belly; but the\r\ndecoction loosens it. The first water, therefore, is thrown away when\r\nit is taken to restrain the bowels. The _Lens palustris_, _Duck-meat_,\r\nmoistens and refrigerates in the second order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See Book I, 79. It is, undoubtedly, the _Cicer Lens_. The\r\nLens palustris is the _Lemna minor_, Angl. Duck-meat. Our author borrows\r\nfrom Dioscorides, who treats of the virtues of the lentil more fully than\r\nit would seem to deserve. It is simply a vegetable astringent. (ii, 129.)\r\nThe other authorities treat of both in the same terms as our author. See\r\nin particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 711); Serapion (c. 9.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΦαλαρὶς,\r\n\r\nPhalaris; the juice, leaves, and seed, when drunk, relieve pains of the\r\nbladder. They are also remarkable for some tenuity of parts, and are of a\r\nheating nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sibthorp refers it to the _Phalaris Canariensis_. Our author\r\nborrows its medicinal character from Dioscorides (iii, 149), and the same\r\nis repeated by Galen and all the authorities who treat of it. None of the\r\nArabians, as far as we can discover, have noticed it, except Ebn Baithar,\r\nwho, in describing it, merely gives extracts from Dioscorides and Galen.\r\nIt would appear, that in the shops of the apothecaries, it still is kept,\r\nand is reputed to be useful in pains of the bladder. See Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 18.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΦαλαγγίτις,\r\n\r\nPhalangitis, _Spiderwort_, is so named because it is a remedy for the\r\nbites of the venomous spiders called phalangia. It also consists of\r\nsubtile parts, and hence is supposed to prove a remedy in cases of\r\ntormina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Sibthorp, it is the _Anthericum Græcum_. Our\r\nauthor, like Galen and the other authorities that treat of it, copies\r\nalmost word for word from Dioscorides. (iii, 112.) Ebn Baithar, in\r\ndescribing it, merely gives extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. It does\r\nnot appear to be noticed by the Arabians. It has been scarcely known in\r\nmodern practice, and yet the _Anthericum Liliastrum_ is still kept in the\r\nshops and retains the name of spiderwort, with the reputation of being\r\nuseful against the bites of scorpions. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΦελλὸς.\r\n\r\nSuber, _Cork_, and particularly that from wine-vessels, when burnt has\r\nvery desiccative ashes. This is mixed up especially with dysenteric\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Theophrastus gives an accurate description of the _Quercus\r\nSuber_. (H. P. iii, 16.) Cork, as Pliny states, is formed from its bark.\r\nHe recommends its ashes or charcoal in hemorrhages. (H. N. xxiv, 8.) Q.\r\nSerenus recommends it in the same cases. (c. 22.) Dioscorides does not\r\ndescribe this article. Galen also omits it in his list of simples, but\r\nbriefly notices it in a preliminary book (v), and recommends the burnt\r\ncork of a wine-cask as an astringent. (De Comp. med. sec. loc. v.) We\r\nhave not been able to trace it in the works of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦιλλυρέα,\r\n\r\nPhillyrea, _Mock Privet_; the leaves of the tree are astringent like\r\nthose of the wild olive. They relieve ulcers in the mouth when chewed,\r\nand when the mouth is rinsed with a decoction of them. When drunk they\r\nprove diuretic and emmenagogue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Stackhouse and Sprengel agree that it is the _Phillyrea\r\nlatifolia_ L. Our author copies its medicinal characters literally from\r\nDioscorides. (i, 125.) None of the other Greek authorities on the Mat.\r\nMed. have described it. Neither can we find traces of it in the works of\r\nany of the Arabians, except Ebn Baithar, who gives nothing of any moment\r\nunder this head but a translation of the chapter of Dioscorides referred\r\nto above. It certainly is not the _Mahaleb_ of the Arabians, as we shall\r\nshow in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦλόμος,\r\n\r\nVerbascum, _Petty Mullein_; there are many species, among which is that\r\ncalled Thryalis. The leaves of all the kinds are possessed of desiccative\r\nand moderately detergent powers, and especially that with the golden\r\nflower. Being sour they suit with all sorts of fluxes. Some also rinse\r\nthe teeth with them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It cannot be doubted that the genus is referable to the\r\n_Verbascum_, but the species cannot be well determined. See Sibthorp\r\n(Flora Græca), and Sprengel (ad Dioscor. iv, 102.) The white female\r\nPhlomos would appear to be the _Verbascum Thapsus_, and the black\r\nis indisputably the _Verbascum nigrum_. The _Phlomis Lychnitis_ of\r\nDioscorides is probably the _V. Lychnitis_. The other species cannot\r\nbe determined with any degree of certainty. Our author abridges the\r\nmedicinal characters given to them by Dioscorides. (l. c.) Galen also,\r\nas well as Aëtius and Oribasius, borrow freely from Dioscorides. The\r\nmullein occurs in the Hippocratic treatises (Morb. Mulier.), but we do\r\nnot find it in the works of Celsus. Pliny describes the verbascum in\r\nnearly the same terms as Dioscorides. (H. N. xxv, 74.) See also Apuleius\r\n(De Herbis, 71.) The Arabians follow Dioscorides in delivering its\r\nmedicinal properties. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 98); Ebn Baithar (i, 184.) The\r\nverbascum held a place in the Dispensatory as late as the time of Lewis.\r\n(ii, 417.) The _V. Thapsus_, _nigrum_, and _Lychnitis_, although now\r\nrejected from our Dispensatory, are still retained in the shops. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to Pharmacop. 91.) It is said that the juice of their leaves,\r\nwhich is acrid and bitterish, is used to poison mice and fish. Lindley\r\n(Veg. King. 683.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, both the _Verbascum\r\nThapsus_ and _thapsiforme_ stand for the female phlomos. (166.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΦοῖνιξ,\r\n\r\n(Called by some Rhus), is a herb like the _Darnel_. It has astringent\r\npowers, and when drunk with austere wine stops all fluxes.\r\n\r\nPalma, _the Palm-tree_, has a fruit which, when ripe, is moderately hot,\r\nstomachic, and tonic, when taken internally or applied externally. The\r\nrest of the palm-tree is sufficiently astringent, and hence is mixed up\r\nas an ingredient with stomach and liver remedies. But the most astringent\r\npart is the involucrum or cover, as it were, of the fruit while growing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The herb is undoubtedly the _Lolium perenne_. The tree is the\r\n_Phœnix Dactylifera_. We would refer to the ‘Hierobotanicon’ of Olaus\r\nCelsius and our own article on this head, in the Appendix to Dunbar’s\r\nGreek Lexicon, for the general literature of this interesting subject.\r\nWe need not dwell particularly on the medicinal virtues of the herb,\r\nas all the authorities are agreed that it is applicable in such cases\r\nas astringents are indicated. See in particular Dioscorides (iv, 43.)\r\nA decoction of different parts of the palm-tree was much used by the\r\nancient physicians as an astringent. Pliny recommends it particularly in\r\ndischarges from the uterus and bowels. (H. N. xxiii, 53.) He borrows,\r\nhowever, from Dioscorides, who recommends it as an astringent in these\r\nand various other cases, such as hemorrhoids and wounds; he adds,\r\nhowever, that they induce headaches, and when eaten in great quantity\r\nintoxicate and that the dried dates when eaten are useful in hæmoptysis,\r\nstomachic and dysenteric diseases, and complaints of the bladder, when\r\napplied in a powder as a cataplasm with the quince and cerate of wild\r\nvine-flowers. (i, 148.) Celsus recommends a decoction of dates as an\r\nastringent gargle. (v, 22, 9.) Galen has a most interesting article\r\non the palm, which he recommends in general as being possessed of an\r\nastringent quality, in hepatic and stomachic affections, both internally\r\nand externally. Serapion, Mesue, and Rhases likewise recommend it in such\r\ncases. Rhases gives a most copious account of this subject borrowed from\r\nvarious sources. One of his authorities says, dates spoil the teeth and\r\ncreate obstructions in the liver and spleen. Another says they create\r\nsemen, and are useful in phthisis. (Cont. l. ult. i, 531.) Avicenna\r\nrecommends them generally as astringents, and particularly in fluxes of\r\nthe womb and in hemorrhoids. (ii, 2, 87.) Ebn Baithar copies mostly from\r\nRhases under this head. (i, 211, 496.) The composition of palm-oil is\r\ndescribed by Dioscorides. (i, 54.) It is the only preparation from the\r\npalm which is now retained in the Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦόρμιον,\r\n\r\nPhormium, is possessed of attenuating, detergent, and attractive powers.\r\nIts seed, therefore, attenuates leucoma, and extracts sharp-pointed\r\nweapons of wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of it is taken from Galen. It would\r\nappear to be a variety of the ὅρμινον, i. e. _Salvia Horminum_ L.,\r\nPurple-top Clary, as is stated by Sprengel. (Notæ in Dioscor. iii, 135.)\r\nWe can find nothing interesting regarding it in the other authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦοῦ,\r\n\r\nValeriana, _Valerian_, has a root which resembles the nard, but is weaker\r\nfor most purposes, only it is more diuretic like Celtic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Valeriana officinalis_, or perhaps the _V.\r\nDioscoridis_. We have mentioned already that the ancient nards were\r\nvarious species of valerian. All the ancient authorities describe it\r\nas being diuretic and emmenagogue. See in particular Dioscorides (i,\r\n10.) Galen ascribes to it diuretic powers (De Simpl. viii), and Pliny\r\nemmenagogue (H. N. xxi, 80.) The Arabians give it the same characters.\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 255); Serapion (De Simpl. 62); Ebn Baithar\r\n(ii, 265.) Bergius in like manner states its virtues thus: “Virtus:\r\nemmenagoga, abortiens, diuretica, sanguinem amovens.” See also Rutty\r\n(Mat. Med.) Recent authorities, however, are not so lavish in its\r\npraises. See Pereira (971.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΦύλλον,\r\n\r\nFolium, _Leaf_, the leaf of the Malabathrum, which has been already\r\ntreated of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Apicius, in like manner, uniformly calls the leaf of the\r\nMalabathrum by the name of _Folium_. We still incline to the opinion\r\nwhich we deliberately formed and expressed some years ago, that it was\r\nthe leaf of the cassia or wild cinnamon tree. We refer to a learned\r\ndisquisition on it by Olaus Celsius, in his ‘Hierobotanicon,’ and to\r\nGeoffroy (Treatise on Fossil, Veg., and Anim. Subst. 318.) The φ. of\r\nDioscorides is quite a different substance, being the same as the\r\nλινόζωστις, which see.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦῦκος,\r\n\r\nFucus marinus, _Seaweed_, cools and dries in the second order, having\r\nalso a moderate degree of astringency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Various species of _Fuci_ are described by Theophrastus and\r\nDioscorides, but so briefly, that it is scarcely possible to determine\r\nthem exactly. It is deserving of remark, however, that Galen, Aëtius, and\r\nOribasius describe a species of Fucus, under the head of Ceruse, which\r\nis therefore supposed to have been a preparation of lead. The article,\r\nhowever, which our author here treats of is unquestionably the vegetable,\r\nas is evident from Aëtius. (p. 24, ed. Ald.) Dioscorides says it is\r\npossessed of an astringent power, which is efficacious in cataplasms\r\nfor the cure of gouty affections and inflammations. These plants are to\r\nbe used in a moist state before they are dried. He adds, that Nicander\r\nsays the purple fucus is theriacal, and that some persons took its root\r\nto be the fucus which women use for painting their face., (iv, 98.)\r\nPliny gives a very similar description of the “Phycos thalassion, id\r\nest, Fucus marinus.” (H. N. xxvi, 66.) Galen treats of it in nearly\r\nthe same language as our author. It would appear to be the Muscus\r\nmarinus of Avicenna, who borrows the description which he gives of it\r\nfrom Dioscorides, (ii, 2, 452, and 711.) Our old English herbalists,\r\nParkinson and Gerard, repeat the characters given to the fuci by the\r\nancients, but these articles were long omitted from our Dispensatories,\r\nuntil of late some of them were readmitted, when it was ascertained that\r\nthey contained iodine. We have known old practitioners, who used the\r\n_Fucus vesiculosus_, or Sea Wrack, very extensively as an application\r\nto scrofulous sores. See further Pereira (562), and Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 7.) Beckmann gives a very ingenious disquisition on the\r\n_Phycos thalassion_ of the ancients, which he makes out to have been our\r\nArchil or _Lichen roccella_, a sea-weed which has been extensively used,\r\nboth in ancient and in modern times for the dyeing of wool. (History of\r\nInventions.) It must be to it that Horace alludes when he speaks of “lana\r\nmedicata fuco,” in his famous ode on Regulus.\r\n\r\n\r\nΦυλλιτὴς,\r\n\r\nPhyllites, _Hart’s Tongue_, is somewhat sour, and from this quality it\r\nnaturally proves a remedy for diarrhœa when drunk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. There seems little reason to doubt that it is the\r\n_Scolopendrium officinale_, or Spleenwort. It is the _Lingua Cervina_ of\r\nParkinson (Theatre of Plants, 1047.) Both Galen and Dioscorides, like\r\nour author, recommend it in fluxes of the bowels, as being possessed of\r\nastringent powers. It is not met with in the works either of Hippocrates\r\nor Celsus. It was retained in the Dispensatory in the time of Quincy (88,\r\n123), and even at the present day it is not an entire stranger to the\r\nshops. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαλβάνη,\r\n\r\nGalbanum, is heating almost in the third degree, and is desiccative\r\nalmost in the second, being possessed of emollient and discutient powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides says of Galbanum, that it is the juice of a\r\nFerula growing in Syria, by some called metopium. Pliny describes it\r\nthus: “Quod maxime laudant, cartilaginosum, purum, ad similitudinem\r\nHammoniaci.” Now, in Dr. Duncan’s edition of the Edinburgh Dispensatory\r\n(1811), it is said in like manner that “Galbanum agrees in virtue with\r\ngum ammoniac;” and from this casual coincidence in the descriptions of\r\nthe ancient and modern galbanums, we infer their identity. It would\r\nappear to be now settled, that galbanum is the product of different\r\numbellifers, the most common of which is the _Opoidia galbanifera_.\r\nSee the late publications of Royle, Lindley, and Pereira. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes it as being possessed of a heating, fiery, epispastic, and\r\ndiscutient power, in pessaries and fumigations as promoting menstruation\r\nand the expulsion of the fœtus; he recommends it externally, for\r\nfurunculi and other complaints of the skin, and internally for chronic\r\ncoughs, dyspnœa, asthma, ruptured and sprained parts; its vapour rouses\r\nin cases of epilepsy, hysteria, and vertigo, and drives away venomous\r\nanimals. It is used in toothache for filling the hollow of the teeth.\r\n(iii, 87.) Galen and the other Greek authorities treat of it in general\r\nterms, like our author. It occurs in the works of Hippocrates, and\r\nin those of Celsus, who recommends it in nearly the same cases as\r\nDioscorides, as in furunculus, difficulty of breathing, and so forth.\r\n(See v, 18, et pluries.) For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 312);\r\nSerapion (c. 320.) They borrow their account of its medicinal virtues\r\nfrom Dioscorides, recommending it as an alexipharmic, an application\r\nto tumours, and a remedy in certain diseases of the chest. Avicenna\r\nsays it is less powerful than sagapenum. The Arabian authorities of Ebn\r\nBaithar do not supply anything of much importance in addition to what is\r\nfurnished by Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαλκίτις,\r\n\r\nChalcitis, is possessed of astringent, acrid, caustic, and escharotic\r\npowers. In subtility of particles it is intermediate between misy and\r\nsori; but when burnt its parts become still finer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We will first give an abstract of the information furnished\r\nby the ancient authorities themselves regarding this much-disputed\r\narticle in their Materia Medica, and reserve what we have to say as to\r\nthe substance itself to the conclusion. Galen is the author who has given\r\nthe fullest account of the nature and formation of the misy, sori, and\r\nchalcitis (see Opera, ed. Basil, T. ii, 127); but as his description of\r\nthem is lengthy, we prefer giving the abstract of the same furnished\r\nby Aëtius. It is to be borne in mind then that what follows is upon\r\nthe authority of Galen, who visited the copper-mines of Cyprus for\r\nthe express purpose of ascertaining the nature of the misy, sori, and\r\nchalcitis. “At the mine in Cyprus, in the mountains of the Soli, there\r\nwas a great cave dug in the mountain, at the right side of which, that\r\nis to say, on our left hand as we entered, there was a passage into the\r\nmine in which I saw certain specimens of the three substances stretched\r\nupon one another like zones, the lowest being that of _sori_, upon it\r\n_chalcitis_, and then that of _misy_. In process of time the chalcitis\r\nchanges into misy by degrees, and the sori can change into chalcitis, but\r\nrequires a much longer space of time. So that it is no wonder that these\r\nthree substances should be possessed of homogeneous (similar) powers, as\r\ndiffering from one another only in tenuity and density of their parts,\r\nthe grossest being the sori, and the finest the misy, whereas chalcitis\r\npossesses an intermediate power. When burnt they become more attenuant,\r\nbut less styptic.” (p. 30, ed. Aldi.) Galen (l. c.) states distinctly\r\nthat the misy is an efflorescence which forms upon the chalcitis, similar\r\nto the verdigris which forms upon copper (or bronze), and that the three\r\nsubstances in question are convertible into one another. He also states\r\nthat a specimen of chalcanthos, when long kept, turns to chalcitis.\r\nPliny gives a very confused account of the misy, sori, and chalcitis,\r\nwhich betrays evident marks of a very imperfect acquaintance with the\r\nsubject; but it is quite obvious that he meant to describe the very same\r\nsubstances as those which Dioscorides and Galen describe under these\r\nnames, as is obvious from his ascribing the same medicinal powers as\r\nthey do to each of these articles. (See H. N. xxxiv, 29, 30, 31, with\r\nthe notes of Harduin.) Dioscorides gives but a very brief description of\r\nthese substances, with the origin of which he most probably was not so\r\nwell acquainted as Galen. He describes the best kind as being like bronze\r\nor copper (χαλκοειδῆ), friable, free of stones, not old, and having long\r\nand glancing fibres. He says of it that it has styptic, heating, and\r\nescharotic powers, and that it clears away impurities about the canthi\r\nand eyes; that it is one of the mild septics; is useful in erysipelas,\r\nherpes, hemorrhages of the uterus and nose, with the juice of leeks;\r\nthat when dried it is useful in epulis, spreading sores, and diseases of\r\nthe tonsils; that when burnt it is more useful in ophthalmic remedies in\r\nthe form of a powder with honey; that it melts down and cleanses callus\r\nand asperity of the eyelids; and removes fistulæ when introduced in\r\nthe form of a collyrium. (v, 115.) It occurs in one of the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises (De Ulceribus), but its meaning there is not well defined.\r\nBy _blue chalcitis_ is probably meant chalcanthos, or blue vitriol.\r\nCelsus prescribes it frequently as a caustic and escharotic application.\r\n(v. 9, et pluries.) As stated already (see _Misy_), Avicenna gives an\r\naccount of these substances under the head of “Atramentum sutorium,”\r\nthe chalcitis being further distinguished by the name of _colcotar_. He\r\nrefers to Galen’s description of them already given, but either he or\r\nhis translator evidently misinterprets the original, for he represents\r\nGalen as saying that the _atramentum rubeum_ (sori) is formed from the\r\n_colcotar_. He says of all the three substances that they are caustic,\r\nescharotic, and styptic; and he recommends them in the same instances\r\nas Dioscorides and Galen do. (ii, 2, 47.) Serapion, as already stated,\r\ndescribes them under the name of _vitreolum_ or _zeg_, including also the\r\nchalcanthos in the same chapter. It may be interesting to our readers to\r\nsee his version of the passage of Galen given above from Aëtius. “Vidi in\r\nmineris tres venas extensas unam super aliam per longum spacium, et vena\r\ninferior erat zeg rubeum (_sori?_), et secunda quæ erat super eam erat\r\ncolcotar (_chalcitis?_), et tertia superior erat zeg viride (_misy?_), et\r\nhoc est quod zeg rubeum convertitur et fit colcotar et colcotar fit zeg\r\nviride.” He afterwards gives Galen’s account of the medicinal powers of\r\nchalcitis, which does not differ materially from our author’s. (De Simpl.\r\n386.) Rhases, under the head of vitreolum, gives, in abridged extracts\r\nfrom Dioscorides and Galen, their descriptions of _sori_, _chalcitis_,\r\nand _misy_, which he calls _vitreolum ruffum_, _colcotor_, and _vitreolum\r\nviride_. (Contin. l. ult. 747.) Averrhoes quotes Galen’s account of the\r\norigin of the three vitriols which he calls _vitreolum rubeum_ (sori?),\r\n_v. viride_ (misy?), and _cholcotar_ (chalcitis?). (Collig. v, 43.) And\r\nnow, respecting the nature of the three metallic substances _misy_,\r\n_sori_, and _chalcitis_, we have to state it as our deliberate opinion,\r\nthat, provided the authority of Galen be held decisive of the question,\r\nthere can be no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that they were\r\nmerely varieties of the chalcanthum, arising principally from age or\r\ndifferences in the proportion of the ingredients entering into its\r\ncomposition. (See below.) Probably then the chalcitis was a specimen of\r\npure sulphate of copper which had contracted an efflorescence from age.\r\nThe misy _or_ zeg viride of the Arabians no doubt owed its colour to a\r\npredominance of the sulphate of iron; while in the sori we may suppose\r\nthat zinc or other impurities gave it its peculiar characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧάλκανθος,\r\n\r\nAtramentum Sutorium, _Copperas_ or _Vitriol_, is water concreted in\r\nthe metal mines of Cyprus, having a very strong astringency with no\r\ncontemptible degree of heat; and of all substances it is the most\r\neffectual for pickling and drying humid flesh. In process of time it\r\nchanges to chalcitis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. No person who reads the account of this substance given by\r\nDioscorides and Pliny can doubt of its being blue vitriol, or an impure\r\nsulphate of copper procured by the evaporation of water found in mines\r\nof copper. Pliny’s description of it is quite characteristic: “Color\r\nest cœruleus, perquam spectabili nitore vitrumque esse creditur.” He\r\nalso states that it is the same as the “atramentum sutorium.” (H. N.\r\nxxxiv, 32.) Celsus says the same of it, and ranks it with styptics (v,\r\n1); with corrosive substances (v, 6); with caustics (v, 7, 8); with\r\nescharotics (vi, 11); and recommends it when strongly heated or roasted\r\nto remove callus (v, 28, 12), and for other purposes. Whether the _blue\r\nchalcitis_ of Hippocrates (De Ulcer. 13), alluded to in the preceding\r\narticle, be blue vitriol as some have supposed (Pereira, Mat. Med. 494),\r\nwe cannot pretend positively to determine, but we think it probable.\r\nGalen describes most graphically his visit to the copper mines of Cyprus,\r\nwhere, among other strange sights, he witnessed the process of procuring\r\nchalcanthum. He mentions that a specimen of it which he carried with\r\nhim in the course of twenty years was converted into chalcitis on its\r\nsurface, while its centre remained chalcanthum, and that he meant to\r\nkeep it until its centre should change likewise, and until the chalcitis\r\nshould be converted into misy. Dioscorides describes several varieties\r\nof the chalcanthum, one of which is called _pectum_, being procured\r\nby natural evaporation; and another _ephthon_ or _coctum_, as being\r\nprocured by boiling. The best kind, he says, is blue, heavy, compact, and\r\ntranslucent. He says it is astringent, heating, and escharotic; kills the\r\nlumbricus latus when taken to the amount of a drachm; that it is emetic,\r\ncures those who have swallowed mushrooms when drunk with water, and that\r\nit purges the head when a piece of wool smeared with it is introduced\r\ninto the nostrils. (v, 114.) Oribasius gives a minute description of the\r\nchalcanthum, but it is confessedly taken from Dioscorides. (Med. Coll.\r\n13.) Aëtius says distinctly that the water running from the copper mines\r\nof Cyprus concretes into chalcanthum, and that it changes into chalcitis.\r\nHe, in fact, evidently borrows from Galen. Avicenna, as formerly stated\r\nby us, gives a description of this substance along with misy, sori, and\r\nchalcitis, under the general head of “atramentum sutorium.” (ii, 2, 47.)\r\nHe also treats of it separately under its proper name, but his account\r\nof it is entirely made up from Dioscorides. (166.) Serapion’s, in like\r\nmanner, is copied from Dioscorides. (c. 386.) Haly Abbas’s chapter on the\r\nvitriols is so barbarously translated, that we cannot pretend to unfold\r\nhis account of this substance. (Pract. ii, 47.) Though, as we have stated\r\nabove, we think there can be no doubt that the chalcanthos of Dioscorides\r\nand Pliny was an impure sulphate of copper procured from the “waters of\r\ncementation” issuing from copper mines, it is proper to mention that\r\nafter mature consideration of the subject, with the assistance of an\r\nesteemed authority on the Materia Medica in London, we have arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that either the term must have been applied loosely to\r\nother metallic sulphates, or the ancient sulphate of copper must have\r\ncontained a very large admixture of the sulphates of iron and of zinc.\r\nProbably, then, the term chalcanthos was used anciently in as loose a\r\nmanner as the terms vitriol and copperas have been in modern times.\r\n(See Tournefort’s Mat. Med.) It is further deserving of remark under\r\nthis head, that the description of the impure sulphate of copper, which\r\nis given in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, corresponds exactly with\r\nDioscorides’s description of the chalcanthos. In the Pharmacopœia it is\r\ndirected that the sulphate of copper should not contain _much_ of the\r\nsulphates of zinc and iron. And now, in conclusion, as this is one of the\r\nmost important subjects connected with ancient pharmacy, we shall briefly\r\nstate our reasons for holding, contrary to the opinion of many recent\r\nauthorities of high reputation, that the chalcanthum either consisted\r\nprincipally of copper, or at least contained a large proportion of that\r\nmetal in its composition. 1st. The name implies that the Greeks thought\r\nit a cupreous substance, and Pliny seems to say that the name had been\r\nproperly given. (l. c.) 2d. Pliny’s description of it applies exactly\r\nto blue vitriol. (l. c.) 3d. Dioscorides’s description of it tallies\r\nwith the description of the sulphate of copper given in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia. 4th. The chalcanthos was indisputably formed from the\r\nevaporation of waters issuing from mines of copper, that is to say, from\r\n“waters of cementation.” Compare Galen (l. c.) with Pereira (Mat. Med.\r\n495.) 5th. It was administered as an emetic. See Dioscorides (l. c.) 6th.\r\nIt was used externally as a powerful escharotic. See Dioscorides, Celsus,\r\nand Galen (pluries.) 7th. It was ranked among the poisons. See Cicero (ad\r\nFamiliares, ix,) and the Arabian authorities on Toxicology.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαλκὸς κεκαυμένος,\r\n\r\nÆs ustum, _Burnt Copper_, is acrid, with a share of astringency. It\r\ntherefore is the best of remedies for the cicatrization of ulcers upon\r\ndry bodies; but if washed it agrees better with tender bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαλκοῦ ἄνθος,\r\n\r\nÆris flos, _the Flower of Copper_, is possessed of more subtile powers\r\nthan burnt copper, or than the squama æris. Wherefore, when added to\r\ncollyria, it clears away asperities and sycoses of the eyelids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Though there can be no doubt that this term is generally used\r\nby the Greek classical authors to signify _bronze_, or a combination of\r\ncopper and tin in the proportion of from 2 to 14 per cent. of the latter,\r\nit is also certain that it was frequently applied to native copper, as it\r\nis in general by the authorities on the Materia Medica. The ancients,\r\nit may be proper to remark cursorily in this place, were acquainted with\r\nthe formation of _brass_, which they made by compounding together copper\r\nand cadmia. See Watson’s ‘Chemical Essays,’ and Beckmann’s ‘History\r\nof Inventions.’ Brass was their aurichalcum _or_ orichalcum. The _Æs\r\nustum_, according to Geoffroy, “is copper reduced to a calx or crocus,\r\neither by itself or mixed with sulphur or salt, by a long calcination in\r\na reverberatory furnace.” “The _Squama æris_, or flake of copper,” he\r\nadds, “is little different from the Æs ustum, being only the particles\r\nof burnt copper which fly off when it is hammered.” He says of the _Flos\r\næris_, “it is nothing but copper reduced to small grains like millet\r\nseed, which is done by pouring cold water upon melting copper, which\r\nthereupon immediately flies every way into grains.” In short it was\r\nfine granulated copper. These preparations of copper are described by\r\nall the ancient authorities. See in particular Dioscorides (v, 87, 88),\r\nwho describes the process of making the flos æris very minutely. He\r\nrecommends it as a detergent and caustic medicine for various purposes,\r\nsuch as removing dimness of the cornea, wasting polypi in the nostrils,\r\nand protuberances about the anus; and also for the cure of deafness\r\nwhen blown into the ear with a syringe in the form of a powder, and\r\nin complaints of the gums and tonsils. He also says that given to the\r\namount of three oboli it evacuates thick humours. He also describes\r\nseveral processes for burning the copper, and recommends the æs ustum as\r\na cleansing and detergent medicine for various ulcers, especially those\r\nof the eye, and also as an emetic when taken in a draught with hydromel,\r\nor in a linctus with honey. None of the other Greek authorities treat\r\nso fully of these preparations as Dioscorides. Celsus prescribes them\r\nfrequently as caustic and corrosive substances. (v, 6, 7, et pluries.)\r\nThe Arabians used these articles not only as external applications, but\r\nas emetics and purgatives. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 231); Serapion (c. 414);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. iii, 48); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 43); Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 48); Ebn Baithar (ii, 551.) The flowers of copper, and burnt\r\nor calcined copper, are noticed in the works of all our earlier writers\r\non medicine, and recommended to be administered both internally and\r\nexternally. See Platearius (De Simpl. Med.) The process of preparing\r\ncalcined copper is minutely described by Moses Charras in his ‘Royal\r\nPharmacopœia,’ published at Paris in 1676. They are briefly described by\r\nDr. Hill, who says of the æs ustum that “it was much used externally by\r\nthe ancients.” (Mat. Med. 32.) Neither of these preparations of copper\r\noccurs in the Complete English Dispensatory of Quincy, published in 1763.\r\nThey are omitted also in Pemberton’s London Dispensatory, published in\r\n1746. They would appear, however, to have been longer retained in use by\r\nthe Continental physicians, since a formula for preparing the _Calx æris_\r\nis given in Crantz’s Mat. Med. (ii, 91. Vienna, 1765.) He says that the\r\n_Flos æris_, and _Squama æris_, were preparations not in use. Rutty ranks\r\nthem among the obsolete medicines of the ancients. A formula for _Æs\r\nustum_ is given in Gray’s Suppl. to Pharmacop. (p. 242.) It is the same\r\nas that of Dioscorides. (v, 37.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμάιδρυς,\r\n\r\nChamædrys, _Germander_, is heating and drying in the third degree. It\r\ntherefore melts down enlarged spleens, proves diuretic and emmenagogue,\r\nand removes visceral obstructions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It clearly is the _Teucrium Chamædrys_ L. Theophrastus\r\nsays that its fruit purges bile. (H. P. ix, 10.) Dioscorides commends\r\nit in spasms, scirrhous spleen, dysuria, and incipient dropsy; and as\r\nan emmenagogue; and, by the way, Dr. Hill confirms this account of it.\r\nGalen and all the other authorities treat of it in nearly the same terms.\r\nWe have not been able to find it in the works of Hippocrates. For the\r\nArabians, see particularly Serapion (c. 180); Avicenna (ii, 2, 132);\r\nRhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 152.) One of Serapion’s Arabian authorities\r\nrecommends the syrup in chronic coughs, dyspepsia, and incipient\r\ndropsies, and the decoction in black jaundice. Avicenna joins both\r\nDioscorides and Serapion in regard to the virtues which they ascribe to\r\nit. Whether or not this be the “trixago” of Celsus (iv, 6) has never\r\nbeen satisfactorily determined. The Arabian translators adopt this name.\r\nIt has still the reputation of being a pectoral medicine. Lindley (Veg.\r\nKingd. 661.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμαίκισσος,\r\n\r\nHedera, _Ground Ivy_; the flower being considerably bitter, removes\r\nobstructions of the liver. It is also given in ischiatic diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We see no good reason for disputing its identity with\r\n_Glechoma hederaceum_, or Ground Ivy, which we believe to have been\r\nintroduced into this country by the Romans for the _Chamæcissos_.\r\nDioscorides gives it nearly the same characters as our author, that is\r\nto say, he recommends it in sciatica and jaundice. (iv, 124.) Galen and\r\nthe other Greek authorities treat of it in nearly the same terms as our\r\nauthor. The Arabians notice it under the same head with the other species\r\nof ivy. See Serapion (De Simpl. 41); Avicenna (ii, 2, 169); Rhases\r\n(Contin. 190.) The ground-ivy maintained a place in the Dispensatory\r\nwith a high reputation as a hepatic, splenitic, diuretic, and nephritic\r\nmedicine in the days of Quincy. (117.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopœia\r\nthe glechoma hederaceum stands for the χαμαίκισσος. (75.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nΧαμαικέρασος. This occurs in the “Euporiston” generally ascribed to\r\nDioscorides. It is referred by Sprengel to the _Convallaria majalis_, or\r\nLily of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμαιλέυκη,\r\n\r\nChamæleuce, _Ground Poplar_, is calefacient in the third order and\r\ndesiccative in the first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel maintains that we should read χαμαιπέυκη, and refers\r\nit to _Stachelina Chamæpeuce_ L. In Dioscor. (iv, 125.) Dioscorides\r\nmerely recommends it in lumbago. All the other authorities assign it the\r\nsame general characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμαιλέων,\r\n\r\nChamæleon; the root of the black chamæleon is calefacient and desiccative\r\nin nearly the third order. It is also a detergent application to the\r\nskin, and a discutient and emollient one to indurated tumours. When\r\napplied in a cataplasm it cures phagedænic ulcers. But when taken\r\ninternally it is poisonous. The root of the white chamæleon is like that\r\nof the black, but more bitter. When drunk with austere wine to the\r\namount of an acetabulum, it kills the broad intestinal worms. It is also\r\nuseful in dropsical complaints.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We stated in the Fifth Book, Sections 37, 46, that we were\r\ninclined to refer the black chamæleon to the _Carthamus corymbosus_,\r\nand the white to the _Carlina acaulis_, and we see no good reason for\r\nchanging this opinion. Some good authorities, however, prefer the _C.\r\ngummifera_. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 708.) The virtues, however, which\r\nDr. Lindley ascribes to the _C. acaulis_, agree very well with those\r\nof the ixia, or white chamæleon, as stated by the ancient authorities;\r\nwhether, however, it produces the gum resembling mastich, as the white\r\nchamæleon is described by Dioscorides as doing, we are not so sure.\r\nParkinson says it produces such a gum “sometimes, and in some places.”\r\n(Theatre of Plants, 968.) See also Gerard (1157.) Dioscorides recommends\r\nits root as a vermifuge; in dropsy and dysuria when taken in wine. (iii,\r\n8.) The root of the black chamæleon he recommends with other articles for\r\nthe cure of lichen, for toothache, and various other purposes. (9.) Our\r\nauthor borrows mostly from Galen under this head. Aëtius remarks that\r\nthe root of the black species is poisonous, and hence is to be applied\r\nonly externally in scabies, lichen, leprosy, and the like. This species\r\nis noticed in the Hippocratic works. (De Ulcer.) The other occurs in the\r\nworks of Celsus, who prescribes it as an ingredient in a malagma for\r\ngout. (v, 18, 33.) The Arabians treat elaborately of both species. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 197, 455); Serapion (c. 274, 275); Rhases (Cont. l. ult.\r\nii, 208); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42.) Upon the whole their characters of\r\nthem agree with those by Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμάιμηλον ἢ Ἄνθεμις,\r\n\r\nChamæmelum, or Anthemis, _Chamomile_, heats and dries in the first order.\r\nIt is also attenuant, discutient, relaxant, and aromatic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It certainly applies to the _Anthemis nobilis_, but probably\r\nis not restricted to it. It appears to be the ἄνθεμον of Theophrastus.\r\n(H. P. vii, 8, 14.) It is the ἄνθεμις of Dioscorides, who describes\r\nthree species, which it has been found very difficult to distinguish and\r\nidentify. He says the roots, the flowers, and the stem are calefacient\r\nand attenuant, that both when drunk and in a hip-bath they promote\r\nthe evacuation of the menses, fœtus, calculi, and urine; that they\r\nare drunk for tympanitis and ileus; cure jaundice and diseases of the\r\nliver; and that the decoction is used in a fomentation for complaints\r\nabout the bladder. He says the chamomiles cure fistula lachrymalis in\r\na cataplasm, and aphthæ as a masticatory, and that the oil prepared\r\nin a manner described by him, is useful in intermittent fevers when\r\nthe body is rubbed with it. (iii, 143.) Aëtius strongly recommends the\r\nwhole body to be rubbed with oil of chamomile in such cases to promote\r\nperspiration. According to Galen this is the ἐυάνθεμον of Hippocrates.\r\n(Morb. Mulier., i, 625.) We cannot find it in Celsus. Galen, in the\r\npreliminary dissertation to his ‘Mat. Med.,’ strongly eulogises the oil\r\nof chamomile as being calculated to soothe pain, relieve contracted\r\nparts, soften hardened, and to dispel fevers not accompanied with\r\nvisceral inflammation. (iii, 133, ed. Basil.) The Arabians appear to have\r\nbeen very partial to this plant, of which they treat at great length. See\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 118); Serapion (De Simpl. 22); Rhases (Contin. l. ult.\r\nii, 154, i, 156); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 34.)\r\nIn a word, they entirely concur in the characters given to the chamomiles\r\nby Dioscorides and Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμαιπίτυς,\r\n\r\nChamæpitys, _Ground Pine_, heats in the second order, but dries in\r\nthe third. It is therefore a cathartic and detergent of the viscera,\r\nespecially of the liver. It is diuretic and emmenagogue, agglutinates\r\nlarge wounds, and cures putrid ulcers. It also discusses scirrhous\r\nswellings, and the decoction of it is useful in ischiatic diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It appears probable that our author’s plant is _Ajuga\r\nchamæpitys_, but here commentators are by no means agreed. It is briefly\r\nmentioned by Nicander (Alex. 65), and by Celsus as a medicine which\r\nopens the pores or mouths of vessels (v, 4), but it does not occur, we\r\nbelieve, in the Hippocratic treatises. Of the three species described by\r\nDioscorides, the first is probably this plant, the second is a species\r\nof _teucrium_, and the third _ajuga iva_. His characters of the first\r\nagree in the main with those given to it by our author, who, as well\r\nas Galen, Aëtius, and Oribasius, evidently copy from him. The other\r\ntwo species, he says, are possessed of similar powers. All the Arabians\r\nconcur in representing it as being diuretic, emmenagogue, a medicine that\r\nexpels the fœtus, and a laxative. See Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 153);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2,131); Serapion (c. 179); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 32.)\r\nAvicenna in particular recommends it for the cure of sciatica and gout,\r\nand for this virtue it was celebrated as long as it retained a place in\r\nour Dispensatory. See Quincy (116.) It was an ingredient in the famous\r\nPortland powder. It is still to be found in the shops, where it bears the\r\nnames of _Iva arthritica_ and _Teucrium chamæpitys_. See Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 49.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμάιδρωψ,\r\n\r\nChamædrops; some call this plant Chamædrys, and some Teucrium, being\r\npossessed of similar powers to the Chamædrys.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. According to Dioscorides it is the same as the Χαμάιδρυς.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμαισύκη,\r\n\r\nChamæsyce, _Ground Fig_, has detergent and acrid powers, so that the\r\ntwigs and juice of it remove myrmecia and acrochordones. They therefore\r\nclear away thick cicatrices in the eyes with honey, and cure dimness of\r\nvision and incipient suffusions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. From the place assigned to it by Dioscorides it was evidently\r\na spurge. It is acknowledged to be the _Euphorbia chamæcyce_. Our\r\nauthor appears to have borrowed the characters which he gives it from\r\nDioscorides. (iv, 167.) Galen and the others do the same. It does not\r\noccur in the works either of Hippocrates or Celsus, nor have we been able\r\nto find it in those of the Arabians. We are not aware of its having been\r\nused by modern authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧαμέλαια,\r\n\r\nChamelæa, _Mezereon_, or _Spurge Olive_, is possessed of detergent\r\npowers. It therefore cleanses foul ulcers and eschars with honey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Notwithstanding the difference of opinion which has prevailed\r\namong the commentators regarding this plant, we see no good grounds\r\nfor doubting that it was the _Daphne Mezereon_, which we believe to\r\nhave been naturalized in this country by the Romans for its medicinal\r\nuses. Dioscorides says of its leaves that they are like to those of the\r\nolive, but more slender and thick, biting to the taste and scarifying\r\nthe trachea. Its leaves, he adds, purge phlegm and bile downwards,\r\nespecially if taken in a pill with double the quantity of southernwood\r\nmixed with one part of the chamelæa; let it be taken in water or honey\r\nas a pill; but it is insoluble, for it is evacuated as it was taken; the\r\npowdered leaves mixed up with honey cleanse foul ulcers, and such as are\r\ncovered with eschars. (iv, 169.) We do not meet with it in the works of\r\nHippocrates nor of Celsus. Galen and the other Greek authorities treat\r\nof it in very general terms like our author. Beyond all doubt is this\r\nthe _mezereon_ of Serapion, who commences his chapter on it by giving\r\nextracts from the descriptions of the _chamelæa_ given by Dioscorides,\r\nGalen, and our author. He then gives a very lengthy account of it from\r\nArabian authorities, first from Alcanzi and next from Aben Mesuai,\r\nwhich we regret that our necessary limits prevent us from giving a\r\nproper abstract of. He says that persons of a gross constitution, and\r\nmore especially old men, bear this medicine best, and he recommends us\r\nto administer it with myrobalans, or tamarinds, or prunes. He further\r\ndirects it to be given in water that has been boiled. Altogether there is\r\nnot a more important chapter in Serapion than the one on Mezereon. (c.\r\n373.) Mesue also gives a very interesting account of the mezereon, which\r\nhe illustrates with extracts from Dioscorides and Galen on the chamelæa.\r\nHe assigns to it powers to purge yellow and black bile, and says that\r\nits greatest use is in dropsy. It is also, he says, anthelminthic.\r\nHe recommends tents smeared with it for fistulæ and sinuous ulcers.\r\n(De Simpl. 22.) Haly Abbas also gives an excellent account of it,\r\nrepresenting it as a medicine which purges phlegm, yellow and black\r\nbile. (Pract. 2, 54, 564.) Rhases describes the two chamæleons and the\r\nchamelæa together under the head of _Laureola_. He quotes “the Book of\r\nPoisons” as stating that in the dose of two drachms it proves fatal.\r\nHe gives quotations from Dioscorides, Galen, and our author. (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 413.) Avicenna, in like manner, describes the two chamæleons and\r\nthe chamelæa under the head of mezereon, but evidently recognised the\r\ndistinction between the last and the first two. He commends the mezereon\r\nparticularly in dropsy. (ii, 2, 455.) The above sketch, it will be\r\nremarked, clearly proves the identity of the χαμέλαια of the Greeks, and\r\nthe Mezereon of the Arabians. We admit, however, that it does not prove\r\ntheir identity with the _Daphne Mezereon_. To us it appears, however,\r\nthat the physiological effects of the mezereon, as described by our best\r\nauthorities of the present day, correspond very well with the effects of\r\nthe chamelæa or mezereon as described by Dioscorides and Serapion. In\r\nparticular compare Pereira (805) with Serapion (l. c.) It is proper to\r\nmention, however, that Sibthorp held the χ. to be _Daphne oleoides_. Both\r\nthe _Daphne Mezereon_, and _D. Gnidium_ are retained in the modern Greek\r\nPharmacopœia. (108.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧελιδόνιον,\r\n\r\nChelidonium, _Columbine_ or _Celandine_; the great is calefacient in\r\nthe third order, and powerfully detergent. The juice of it contributes\r\nto acuteness of sight. The root when drunk with anise removes icteric\r\nobstructions, and also when taken with wine. When masticated it cures\r\ntoothache. The smaller species, which belongs to the fourth order of\r\ncalefacients, is more acrid, so as to ulcerate the skin in a cataplasm.\r\nIt also removes leprous nails. The juice of it purges by the nose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. That the first species is the _Chelidonium majus_ L. admits\r\nof no dispute. The other would seem to be the _Ranunculus Ficaria_, or\r\nFig-wort. Pliny praises it as an application to strumous tumours, and\r\na remedy for impairment of sight. From the experiments of Orfila, it\r\nappears that the _C. magus_ acts as a very acrid poison. Dioscorides\r\ndescribes the great celandine very minutely, and recommends it in\r\njaundice and toothache. (ii, 201.) He gives the same character of the\r\nless as our author. (ii, 212.) Galen and Aëtius treat of them like our\r\nauthor. Neither of them is to be found in the works of Hippocrates.\r\nCelsus prescribes the juice of the “chelidonia” as an application to\r\nenlarged tonsils. (vi, 14.) Both species are distinctly treated of by\r\nthe Arabians. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 295, 727); Serapion (c. 196); Rhases\r\n(Cont. l. ult. i, 200.) They all recommend the juice of the greater\r\ncelandine in jaundice, in toothache, and in affections of the eyes. It\r\nlong held a place in our Dispensatory, retaining its character for curing\r\njaundice and removing films from the eyes. See Quincy (117.) Even at the\r\npresent day rustic farriers use the acrid juice of the celandine for\r\nremoving films from the eyes of cattle. The chelidonium majus occurs in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia. (46.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧελιδόνες,\r\n\r\nHirundines, _Swallows_; when burnt their ashes, if rubbed in with honey,\r\ncure inflammatory cynanche. They also contribute to acuteness of sight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is the _Hirundo rustica_. Celsus also recommends the ashes\r\nof swallows in cases of cynanche and diseases of the eyes. (iv, 4.)\r\nDioscorides speaks of their use in these and in other cases. (ii, 6.)\r\nGalen gives the same account of them as our author. The Arabians repeat\r\nthe descriptions given by Dioscorides and Galen. See Serapion (c. 443);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 347); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 741); Ebn Baithar (i,\r\n375.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧολὴ,\r\n\r\nFel, _Bile_, or _Gall_, is the hottest of all animal juices, but differs\r\naccording to the colour, for the yellow is hotter than the pale, and the\r\nviolet-coloured than the yellow; and also according to the difference of\r\nthe animals which produce it; forasmuch as that of swine is the weakest\r\nof all, so that it agrees with ulcers in the ears, and does not prove\r\npungent; but that of sheep is more acrid, and still more that of goats,\r\nto which the galls of bears and oxen are allied. But the gall of bulls\r\nis stronger, and still more so that of the hyæna, next that of the fish\r\ncalled callionymus, and that of the scorpion which answers in suffusions,\r\ndimness of vision, and leucomata, and likewise that of the sea-tortoise.\r\nThe gall of the wild goat is believed to cure nyctolopia. The gall of\r\nall fowls is more acrid and desiccative than the gall of quadrupeds. But\r\nof them the best is the gall of cocks and partridges. Those of hawks and\r\neagles are in so far more acrid and corrosive, and of a violet colour,\r\nbut sometimes black.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Our author’s account of the medicinal properties of _bile_\r\nis abridged from Galen. Bile is an article which, although now excluded\r\nfrom the British Pharmacopœias, still holds its place in the Continental.\r\nScarpa recommends the gall of certain animals for the removal of albugo.\r\nPliny thus states its virtues as a medicine: “Vis ejus excalfacere,\r\nmordere, scindere, extrahere, discutere. Minorum animalium subtilius\r\nintelligitur, et ideo ad oculorum medicamenta utilius existimatur.”\r\n(H. N. xxviii, 40.) See Dioscorides (ii, 96.) Avicenna calls it a hot,\r\nabstergent medicine. Of quadrupeds, he says, the strongest is that of a\r\ncalf, and the weakest that of a sheep. He treats largely of the subject,\r\nbut draws liberally from Dioscorides and Galen (ii, 2, 250.) See also\r\nSerapion (De Simpl. 459); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 50); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 291); Ebn Baithar (ii, 510.) The gall of a bull is retained in\r\nthe modern Greek Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧονδρίλη,\r\n\r\nChondrile, _Gum Succory_, being a _species of Endive_, is bitterish, and\r\nis therefore so far more desiccative than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the _Chondrilla juncea_, or _Gum\r\nSuccory_. It produces a gum similar to _Lactucarium_, for which it is\r\nstill cultivated in Lemnos. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 708.) Dioscorides\r\ndescribes another species which is supposed to be _Apargia tuberosa_.\r\nDioscorides describes accurately the gum of the former species which he\r\ncompares to mastich, and says of it that when applied on a linen cloth\r\nwith myrrha to the size of an olive it is emmenagogue; that along with\r\nnatron it cleanses mild leprosy; that the gum is used for glueing the\r\nhairs of the eyelashes; that the fresh root does the same when a needle\r\nis dipped into it and applied to the hairs; that it is beneficial in the\r\nbites of the viper; and that its juice is an astringent of the bowels.\r\nHe describes the second species as being also glutinous. (ii, 160.)\r\nGalen and the other Greek authorities treat only of the former species,\r\nand that in very brief terms. Neither of them are described either by\r\nHippocrates or Celsus. We find difficulty in discovering traces of it\r\nin any of the works of the Arabians, except Ebn Baithar (i, 395.) The\r\n_Chondrilla juncea_ is still not wholly unknown in the shops. See Gray\r\n(Suppl. to Pharmacop. 63.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧόνδρος,\r\n\r\nChondrus, is like wheat, but more glutinous than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In the First Book we have explained its nature. (Vol. I,\r\n123.) It would appear to have been the article now called _Farro_, being\r\nprepared from the spelt wheat, exactly as pearled barley is from barley.\r\nSee Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΧρυσοκόλλα,\r\n\r\nChrysocolla; one kind of it is found in metal mines, and another is\r\nprepared in a mortar of red copper with a pestle of the same, it being\r\ntriturated with the urine of a boy not come to puberty during the heat\r\nof the dog days. It therefore is detergent, having discutient and\r\ndesiccative powers greater than those of the kind found in metal mines,\r\nso that it consumes flesh without being pungent. It therefore agrees with\r\nill-conditioned ulcers. By burning it you may render it less pungent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. In order to understand this very complicated subject, it\r\nwill be necessary in the first place to give an exposition of what the\r\nancients themselves have written upon it. Dioscorides writes thus of\r\nthe Chrysocolla: “The best is the Armenian, which is of an intense leek\r\ncolour; the second in quality is the Macedonian; and then the Cyprian, of\r\nwhich the kind that is pure must be selected; but that which is full of\r\nearth and stones must be rejected. The aforesaid article is to be worked\r\nthus: Having pounded it, throw it into a mortar, and having poured in\r\nwater, rub strongly with the flattened hand to the mortar; then allowing\r\nit to settle, strain; and pouring in more water, again rub, and do this\r\nalternately until it becomes clean and pure; then having dried it in\r\nthe sun, lay past for use. But if you wish to burn (calcine?) it, do so\r\nin the following manner: Having triturated it sufficiently, put it into\r\na pan, place upon the coals, and do otherwise as we previously said in\r\nthe former cases. The chrysocolla has the power of deterging ulcers,\r\nrepressing and cleansing fungous flesh; is styptic, calefacient, mildly\r\nseptic, with a certain amount of pungency. It belongs to the class of\r\nmedicines which excite vomiting, and which may prove fatal to life.” (v,\r\n104.) This chrysocolla is evidently the same as that which Theophrastus\r\nhas described as “being found in great quantity in gold mines and the\r\nparts around them.” (De Lapid. 47.) Now we may here say at once that\r\nevery person conversant with mineralogy, must recognise the chrysocolla,\r\ndescribed above, as being the mineral called “common copper-green” by\r\nJameson, being an impure carbonate of copper. For a clear description of\r\nit, see Cleaveland (Mineralogy, p. 570.) This, it will be remarked, is\r\nthe only substance to which Dioscorides applies the name of Chrysocolla;\r\nbut in a preceding chapter, treating of the varieties of verdigris, he\r\nsays, “There is a certain kind of verdigris made by the goldsmiths, by\r\nmeans of a mortar and pestle, of Cyprian copper and the urine of a young\r\nperson, _with which they solder gold_.” (v, 92.) Now to this variety of\r\nthe verdigris, as we shall soon see, the name Chrysocolla (from its being\r\nused in soldering gold) was also applied by the writers subsequent to\r\nDioscorides. Thus Pliny (H. N. xxxiii, 26, 27, 28) first gives a very\r\nelaborate description of the true chrysocolla; and then in the following\r\nchapter he briefly notices the other kind, which he says was also called\r\n“santerna,” and was prepared from Cyprian verdigris, the urine of a boy,\r\nwith the addition of nitrum (soda?) pounded in a Cyprian mortar with\r\nCyprian copper _or_ bronze. This, he adds, forms a solder to gold. This,\r\nhowever, he does not say was ever used in medicine. The former kind\r\nor true chrysocolla of Dioscorides, he says was used in medicine for\r\ncleansing wounds along with wax and oil, and also in a dry powder; that\r\nit was given in a linctus with honey for orthopnœa and angina; that it\r\nwas used as an emetic; was added as an ingredient to collyria for specks\r\non the eyes, and to green plasters for relieving pain and contracting\r\ncicatrices. This chrysocolla, he says, in conclusion, the physicians\r\ncall _acesis_ (a term, by the way, synonymous with medicinal), and was\r\ndifferent from the _orobitis_ which he had previously described as being\r\nartificially tinged with a herb called by him “lutum,” meaning thereby,\r\nwe suppose, woad, or the _Isatis tinctoria_. (l. c.) Galen describes the\r\ntwo kinds together, and treats of their medicinal powers as follows:\r\nThis medicine, chrysocolla, is one of those that consume the flesh, and\r\nis not strongly pungent; but it is moderately discutient and desiccant.\r\nWherefore some call only the fossil by this name, but some also the\r\nsubstance which is prepared in a bronze (copper?) mortar with a copper\r\npestle by means of the urine of a boy, which some value according to\r\nthe differences of the verdigris. But it is better to prepare it in\r\nsummer, or at least in hot weather, pounding the urine in the mortar.\r\nAnd it answers more excellently if the bronze, of which you make the\r\nmortar, be red, and the pestle too, for more is thus rubbed off by the\r\nturning round of the pestle when the bronze is of a softer nature. This\r\nmedicine is most suited to malignant sores, both by itself and mixed\r\nwith other substances. He concludes by saying of the fossil chrysocolla,\r\nthat the more desiccative the less stimulant it is, as being so much\r\nthe more attenuated; and that when burnt (calcined), it becomes still\r\nmore attenuated. (De Simpl. ix.) It is clear from this statement that\r\nGalen included under his list of Simples both the fossil chrysocolla and\r\nthe kind prepared from verdigris. Aëtius merely abridges the account of\r\nthe chrysocolla given by Galen. (ii, 81.) And as Oribasius professedly\r\ncopies his descriptions of the fossils used in medicine from Dioscorides,\r\nwe need not say anything further of his account of chrysocolla, than\r\nthat it coincides entirely with that of Dioscorides. (Med. Coll. xiii.)\r\nCelsus ranks it with the corrosive (v, 6) and the caustic substances. (v,\r\n8.) We now turn to the Arabians. Avicenna, in the first place, treats\r\nof this substance under the name of chrysocolla, of which he describes\r\ntwo species; the one, the artificial, made with the urine of a boy in\r\na bronze mortar, as already explained; the other the fossil, of which\r\nhe says he will now treat. He describes its general characters, namely,\r\nthat it is abstergent, caustic, septic, and so forth. Referring to\r\nDioscorides and Galen, he calls it an emetic and astringent medicine,\r\nand good for malignant sores. (ii, 2, 358.) He there refers to sect.\r\n696, where he treats of tincar, of which he says that it consists of two\r\nkinds, the fossil and the factitious, the latter of which is called the\r\ngold-solder (capistrum auri). It is useful, he says, in toothache and\r\ncarious teeth. Averrhoes describes it under the names of Laçacolaap, i.\r\ne. Consolidatura auri; in Arabic, _Cumbar_. He gives exactly the same\r\naccount of the two species as Galen. He says the factitious kind is best\r\nprepared in a mortar of red bronze with the urine of a young person;\r\nwhich species is more efficacious than the other. (Collig. v, 43.)\r\nSerapion in the portion of his work devoted to minerals, writes thus of\r\n_Tincar_, i. e. _Borax_. “Ebn Amram says of it, it is of the species\r\nof salts, and is found with the taste of _baurach_ (nitrum?), and has\r\nsome bitterness; and it is either fossil or factitious. And the fossil\r\nis in the banks of the sea; it is hot, dry, and subtile; is useful in\r\ntoothache, and kills the worm in them, and in stopping the throbbing in\r\nthem it has wonderful powers.” Rhases and Aben Mesuai say of it, that the\r\nbasis (radix) of it is the urine of a boy, we mean of the factitious,\r\nand it is the solder of gold (chrysocolla.) It would appear to be the\r\nchrysocolla which is described by Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 48, 495), but\r\nwe must admit ourselves incapable of interpreting correctly his meaning\r\nas expressed in the _barbarous_ translation of his works. Ebn Baithar\r\nfirst treats of chrysocolla under the name of Tankâr in an extract from\r\nthe works of Ebn Amram which we have given above as quoted by Serapion.\r\n(i, 214.) And again in the 2d volume (434), he first gives descriptions\r\nof the chrysocolla in extracts from Dioscorides and Galen, and concludes\r\nwith the remark that some people called it the tankar chrysocolla, but\r\nthat the chrysocolla of Dioscorides and Galen was a totally different\r\narticle from the tankar. Rhases gives merely extracts from Dioscorides\r\nand Galen. (Cont. l. ult. i, 25.) He calls it adhesio auri. From what\r\nhas been stated above, we now draw the following conclusions regarding\r\nthe matters treated of under this head: 1. That the mineral known by the\r\nnames of “copper green,” “mountain green,” “native carbonate of copper,”\r\nwas the true chrysocolla of Dioscorides, the said term signifying _Gold\r\nsolder_. 2. That Dioscorides further describes a preparation of verdigris\r\nwhich was also used for soldering gold, to which the name chrysocolla\r\nwas likewise applied by Pliny, Galen, and others. 3. That under the\r\nnames of _Tincal_, _Tankâr_, and _Borax_, the Arabians described a\r\nspecies of salt, which most probably was our _Sodæ Biboras_, to which\r\nthey sometimes applied the name chrysocolla from its being used in the\r\nsoldering of gold, but their best authorities (as for example, Avicenna,\r\nand Ebn Baithar) were well aware that this borax was a totally different\r\nsubstance from the chrysocolla of Dioscorides. The name borax is probably\r\na corruption of _Baurach_, which is the term applied by the Arabians to\r\nthe nitrum of the Greeks and Romans, that is to say, _natron_, or soda.\r\nIf the reader will take the trouble to read what has been written on the\r\nchrysocolla of the ancients by many learned men in modern times, as, for\r\nexample, Alston, Hill, Geoffroy, Quincy, Sprengel, and Kidd, he will be\r\nthe better able to judge whether or not we have succeeded in illustrating\r\nwhat has always been considered a very obscure subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nΧρυσοκόμη ἢ Χρυσῖτις,\r\n\r\nChrysocome or Chrysitis; its root has at the same time acrid and\r\nastringent powers, and therefore is not much used. Only in peripneumonia\r\nand hepatic affections it is given boiled in honeyed water. It also\r\npromotes menstruation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Pliny complains that it had no name in the Latin language;\r\nand Anguillara and Matthiolus were unable to make out what it is. It\r\nnow holds a place in the Linnæan system by the name of _Chrysocoma\r\nLinosyris_. Our author borrows his characters of this article from\r\nDioscorides (iv. 55.) Galen describes it in almost the same words. It is\r\nnot to be found in the works of Dioscorides or Celsus, nor, as far as we\r\ncan discover, in those of the Arabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΨευδοβούνιον,\r\n\r\nPseudo-Bunion, _Bastard Rape_; its properties being like those of rape,\r\nit is heating, discutient, and detergent. It, therefore, removes tormina,\r\nstranguries, and pains of the sides. It also discusses scrofulous\r\nswellings when applied along with salts and wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It would appear that it is the _Pimpinella tenuis_ or\r\n_Slender Burnet_. Our author copies from Dioscorides. Galen treats very\r\nlightly of this article. It does not appear that it is treated of by the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\n\r\nΨευδοδίκταμνον,\r\n\r\nPseudo-Dictamnum, _Bastard Dittany_, has the powers of weak dittany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We are inclined to join those who refer it to the _Marrubium\r\nPseudodictamnum_. Galen and Dioscorides join in representing it as an\r\narticle of little consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nΨιμύθιον,\r\n\r\nCerussa, _White Lead_, is refrigerant and emplastic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We have treated of it as a poison in Book V. § 59. Alston\r\nsays: “Our white lead is certainly the Ψιμύθιον of Dioscorides and the\r\nCerussa Plinii” (xviii.) The ancient ceruse consisted of the carbonate\r\nof lead which had been exposed to the vapours of vinegar, and was,\r\ntherefore, little or nothing different from the modern ceruse. Geoffroy’s\r\ndescription of the process is taken, in fact, from Dioscorides. It\r\nwould appear to have been sometimes administered internally, if, as Dr.\r\nHill remarks, it is an ingredient in the _Trochisci albi_ of Rhases.\r\nWe have not been able to find, however, this trochisc in Rhases, nor\r\nin any of the ancient authorities. Perhaps Dr. Hill confounded it with\r\nthe Emplastrum album, of which ceruse is an ingredient. (See Galen, De\r\nComp. Med. sec. gen. vi, and Celsus, 222 ad Milligan.) Galen in fact\r\nexpressly says that ceruse ought not to be administered internally\r\n(Meth. Med. iv.) He recommends it as an anodyne collyrium in pains of\r\nthe eyes (Comment. in App. vi, 31), and as an astringent and soothing\r\napplication in general. (De Simpl. Med. ix.) Dioscorides describes\r\nminutely the preparation of ceruse, and the different kinds of it, but\r\ngives its medicinal properties in brief terms like our author. (v. 103.)\r\nCelsus recommends it in burns and ulcers (vi, 7), but internally taken\r\nhe treats of it as a poison (v, 27, 15.) All the other Greek and the\r\nArabian authorities after Galen give ceruse exactly the same characters\r\nas we have stated them above. See in particular Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n378); Avicenna (ii, 2, 117); Haly Abbas (Pract. ii, 48); Ebn Baithar (i,\r\n63.) The last of these says of it, that it is useful in the same class\r\nof cases as Minium; that dissolved in vinegar, and more especially when\r\nmixed up with rose-oil, it is a good application in cephalalgia; that it\r\nforms a proper ingredient in collyria for inflammations of the eyes,—and\r\ndissolved in a woman’s milk or mixed up with the white of an egg,—that it\r\nis dropped into the eye with advantage in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nΨύλλιον,\r\n\r\nPsyllium, _Fleawort_; the seed belongs to the second order of\r\nrefrigerants. With regard to heating and moistening powers it holds an\r\nintermediate place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Sprengel remarks, that there can be no difficulty about it;\r\nit is the _Plantago Psyllium_ L. Dioscorides and Pliny recommend it\r\npounded with hog’s lard as an application to malignant ulcers; Pliny\r\nalso says that its seed is a good application to the bites of serpents.\r\n(H. N. xxvi, 66.) Dioscorides says it cures tumours, arthritic diseases,\r\nintestinal hernia, and other complaints, with rose-oil, vinegar or water.\r\nIt is, he says, a powerful refrigerant. (iv, 70.) Galen and the other\r\nGreek authorities give its characters succinctly like our author. Celsus\r\nputs it in his list of agglutinative substances (v, 2.) The Arabians\r\nrecommend it for the same purposes as the Greeks, and also for allaying\r\nthe inflammation of acute fevers. See Avicenna (ii, 2, 533); Serapion\r\n(De Simpl. 230); Ebn Baithar (i, 132); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 567);\r\nMesue (De Simpl. 20.) We have treated of it as a poison in Book V. §\r\n40. According to Crantz its poisonous qualities have been exaggerated\r\nby Dioscorides. (Mat. Med. iii, 117.) Accordingly we do not find it\r\ntreated of by the late writers on toxicology. Although it has long\r\nceased to occupy a place in our dispensatory, it has been celebrated in\r\nmodern times for its medicinal virtues. Platearius commends it highly\r\nas a cooling and astringent medicine, in acute fevers, dysenteries,\r\nhemorrhages, &c. (De Simpl. Med.) Prosper Alpinus mentions that the\r\nmodern Egyptians make frequent use of its mucilage as a medicine, and\r\nhence he finds fault with Dioscorides and Mesue for setting it down as\r\na poison. (De Med. Ægypt.); and Rutty (Mat. Med. 415.) Its seeds form\r\nwith boiling water a rich mucilage, which it appears is still much used\r\nin India, in catarrh, gonorrhœa, and nephritic affections. Lindley (Veg.\r\nKingd. 643.) A recent authority on pharmacy says of it that its seeds are\r\nmucilaginous and purgative. Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 44.)\r\n\r\n\r\nΨωρικὸν,\r\n\r\nPsoricum, is formed by mixing two parts of chalcitis with one of\r\nlitharge, triturating them in vinegar, and, having put them into a new\r\npot, by burying them in dung for forty days. It becomes more desiccative,\r\nmore subtile, and less pungent than chalcitis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Dioscorides and Pliny call it a mixture of cadmia and\r\nchalcitis; Galen, Aëtius, and our author say of litharge and chalcitis.\r\nAvicenna follows Dioscorides. (ii, 2, 273.) Celsus also directs it to be\r\nmade of chalcitis and cadmia. (vi, 6, 31.) It derives its name from its\r\nbeing used as an application to parts affected with scabies (psora.) The\r\npsoricum has been long unknown in the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nὨὸν,\r\n\r\nOvum, _An Egg_; the white and thin part is free from all pungency,\r\nbeing moderately cooling. It is to be used for the eyes, ulcers in the\r\npudendum, and all ill-conditioned ulcers. It is also mixed up with the\r\nmedicines which form styptic plasters. And the yelk of an egg being\r\npossessed of similar powers, is mixed up with anti-inflammatory remedies.\r\nWhen roasted it becomes more desiccative but less soothing. If a whole\r\negg be boiled in vinegar, and eaten, it dries up alvine fluxes. But if,\r\nhaving received the addition of some sour substances, such as galls,\r\nsumach, or the flowers of the wild pomegranate, it be fried, it becomes\r\nconsiderably more drastic. A whole egg applied raw immediately relieves\r\nburns. When taken in a supping state, it concocts and soothes affections\r\nin the chest, and proves demulcent for asperities of the trachea. New\r\neggs are to be preferred to old, and those of hens to the eggs of all\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Galen gives, in his usual copious and elegant style, a\r\nsomewhat lengthy dissertation on the medicinal properties of eggs, but\r\nthe narrow limits to which we are necessarily restricted, prevent us\r\nfrom transferring the substance of it to our pages, although it contains\r\nmuch that is highly interesting. (De Simpl. xi.) Galen recommends eggs\r\nfor various medicinal purposes; and in particular he says that wool\r\ndipped in the white of an egg proves a serviceable application to burns.\r\nDioscorides states their virtues more briefly, and to him our author is\r\nmore particularly indebted. (ii, 54, 55.) He recommends the white of an\r\negg in a tepid state for severe pains of the bladder and ulceration of\r\nthe kidneys, roughness of the windpipe, vomiting of blood, catarrhs,\r\nand defluxions of the chest. Pliny, Dioscorides, and Sextus Platonicus\r\nsay that eggs pounded with oil form an excellent application in cases\r\nof erysipelas, the leaves of beet being laid on the place. Pliny\r\nand Dioscorides recommend them for affections of the eyes. Avicenna\r\nrecommends the white of an egg with melilot in ulcers of the intestines.\r\nHe says eggs boiled in vinegar are useful in diarrhœa and dysentery. He\r\nrecommends a suppository of the albumen of an egg in prolapsus ani, and\r\nother affections of the fundament. Like the preceding authorities he\r\nspeaks favorably of it as an application to the eyes. (ii, 2, 520.) See\r\nalso Ebn Baithar (i, 193); Serapion (c. 446); Rhases (Ad Mansor.; Antid.\r\niv.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὬκιμον,\r\n\r\nOcimum, _Basil_, belongs to the second order of calefacients, and has\r\nalso some recrementitious humidity, hence it is of no use when taken\r\ninternally; but when applied externally, it is discutient and digestive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It most probably is the _Ocimum Basilicum_. Dioscorides not\r\nonly recommends it for many medicinal purposes externally, but also\r\nsays of it that it loosens the bowels, is carminative, diuretic, and\r\ncreates milk, but is of difficult digestion; the seed, he adds, when\r\ntaken in a draught, is beneficial in melancholy, dysuria, and flatulence,\r\nand it is also sternutatory. (ii, 170.) Our author follows Galen very\r\nclosely. Aëtius also condemns the internal administration of basil,\r\nbut praises highly a decoction of it as a fomentation to the eyes, and\r\nparticularly those of children. Oribasius as usual follows Dioscorides,\r\nand, therefore, like him approves of the internal use of it. It occurs\r\nin the works both of Hippocrates and Celsus, the latter of whom says of\r\nit that it moves the bowels, and is diuretic. (ii, 29, 31.) The Arabians\r\ntreat of it still more fully than the Greeks. Avicenna says it is a\r\ncordial medicine, that it generally binds the bowels, but also moves\r\nthem, if there be humours in them, that it is useful in hæmoptysis and in\r\ndifficulty of breathing. (ii, 2, 101.) See also Serapion (c. 167); Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 110); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. ii, 121.) The basil held a place\r\nin our English dispensatory down to the times of Quincy and Lewis. It\r\nholds a place in the modern Greek Pharmacopœia, where it is stated that\r\nit is indigenous in Persia, and only cultivated in gardens in Greece. (p.\r\n27.)\r\n\r\n\r\nὨκιμοειδὲς,\r\n\r\n_Ocimoides_, which some call Philetærium. Its root is useless, but the\r\nseed is composed of subtile matter, and is desiccative without pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Matthiolus held it to be a species of lychnis, but this\r\nopinion is rejected by Dodonæus. Sprengel agrees with Lobelius and\r\nDalecampius in referring it to the _Saponaria ocimoides_. This is one of\r\nthe most disputed articles of the ancient Mat. Med. Of the conjectures\r\nwhich have been made respecting it, the most probable then is that it\r\nwas either a species of _Lychnis_ or _Saponaria_. See Parkinson (Theatre\r\nof Plants, 630, 760.) We are disposed to acquiesce in opinion with those\r\nwho hold it to be the _Saponaria ocimoides_. Dioscorides says of it, that\r\nits seed when drunk in wine is calculated to benefit those who have been\r\nstung by scorpions, and is useful for the bites of all other kinds of\r\nreptiles, and that it is given in sciatica with myrrh and pepper. (iv,\r\n28.) Galen states its character in nearly the same terms as our author.\r\nIt is not described by Aëtius, by Hippocrates or Celsus, nor, as far\r\nas we can discover, by any of the Arabians, with the exception of Ebn\r\nBaithar, whose notice of it is entirely made up from Dioscorides and\r\nGalen. (i, 93.) It has been long unknown to our Dispensatory, and does\r\nnot occur in the Pharmacopœia of the modern Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO THE THIRD SECTION.\r\n\r\n_On the Substances introduced into the Materia Medica by the Arabians._\r\n\r\nHaving thus given a brief account of all the Simple Substances described\r\nby the Greek and Roman writers on the Materia Medica, we are now called\r\nupon to supply what information we can procure regarding the additions\r\nmade to their list by the Arabians. This, we need scarcely say, is a\r\nfield of research, which, having been hitherto but little cultivated,\r\nis attended with difficulties of a particularly formidable nature; for,\r\nalthough we have been enabled to avail ourselves of the learned labours\r\nof Professor Sprengel, Dr. Royle, Dr. Ainslie, and of certain other\r\noriental scholars who have touched cursorily upon these matters, we have\r\nbeen more thrown upon our own resources on the present occasion than\r\nat any other stage of our progress in executing this work. We trust,\r\nthen, that our readers will receive with peculiar indulgence our present\r\nessay, which, however imperfect, will be found, if we mistake not, to\r\nhave opened up a mine of valuable knowledge from which some more skilful\r\nlabourer in the same line will yet draw additional stores of information\r\nto the profession. Of course it will be readily seen, that we do not\r\npretend to give an account of all the articles introduced into the\r\npractice of medicine by the Arabians; that, even if we were possessed of\r\nthe requisite knowledge of the oriental languages, would evidently be\r\nout of the question within our narrow limits. For Ebn Baithar alone, if\r\nhis laborious work were properly explored, would furnish a large volume\r\nof new matters added by his own individual exertions to the accumulated\r\ntreasures of his predecessors; but, of the articles first treated of\r\nby him there are unfortunately many which are but very doubtfully\r\ndetermined, and not a few which are left wholly undetermined by his\r\ntranslator Dr. Sontheimer. And here it is but right that we should\r\nacknowledge that the translation itself would have been to us “a sealed\r\nbook” if our learned friend, Professor Blackie, of Aberdeen, had not\r\ncome to our assistance, and in so far made up for our own very imperfect\r\nacquaintance with the German language. But, besides the stores of Ebn\r\nBaithar, there is much in those of Avicenna, Serapion, Rhases, and Haly\r\nAbbas, which still remain to be unfolded by some fortunate _savant_ who\r\nis acquainted both with the languages of the East and the sciences of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to mention, that the articles which are here described\r\nare set down in the same order as the notices of them were composed,\r\nbecause we could not satisfy ourselves with regard to any methodical\r\narrangement which would conveniently apply to them and be in unison with\r\nthe general plan of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ambra grisea._\r\n\r\nA recent writer on the Materia Medica gives the following description of\r\nAmbergris: “The substance called _Ambergris_ (ambra grisea) is procured\r\nfrom the Cachalot or spermwhale. In this country it is used as a perfume\r\nonly; on the continent it is employed in medicine. It appears to be the\r\nindurated fæces (perhaps somewhat altered by disease) of the animal.\r\nMr. Beale collected some of the semi-fluid fæces, and found that the\r\ndried mass had all the properties of ambergris. It is a solid, opaque,\r\ngrayish, striated substance, having a pleasant musk-like odour, and which\r\nis derived from the squid (_sæpia moschata_) on which the animal feeds.”\r\nPereira (Mat. Med. 1392.) No one who compares this account of ambergris\r\nwith what is said of it in the extracts we have given from Serapion and\r\nAvicenna under _Electrum_, can entertain a doubt that these authors were\r\nwell informed as to the nature of this substance. Ebn Baithar gives a\r\nsimilar account of the origin of ambergris. He says, it is furnished by\r\nsea monsters which swallow it and vomit it up again. It swims on the\r\nsurface of water, and the blackish kind is of little value. He calls it\r\nthe most excellent of all aromatics, and praises it for strengthening the\r\nheart and brain, and for curing cramp and similar complaints. Among other\r\npowers which it possesses, it is said to be intoxicating. (i, 210, 405.)\r\nSee also Haly Abbas (Theor. v, 33.) The Greeks and Romans would appear to\r\nhave been unacquainted with this species of Amber until after the Arabian\r\nperiod. It is accurately described by Symeon Seth, as we have already\r\nstated above in the commentary on _Electrum_. He holds it to be a good\r\ncordial and stomachic medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bezoar._\r\n\r\nAs this article is now but little known in this country, it may be proper\r\nto prefix some account of it from recent authorities. Lewis writes of\r\nit thus: “_Lapis Bezoar orientalis_, oriental Bezoar stone, supposed to\r\nbe produced in the pylorus or in a cavity at the bottom of the fourth\r\nstomach of an animal of the goat kind, which inhabits the mountains in\r\ndifferent parts of Persia.” (Mat. Med. 217.) But Bontius is, perhaps we\r\nmay say, the most accurate of the modern authorities who have described\r\nthe oriental bezoars. He describes them as being alvine concretions which\r\nform in goats or gazelles, and have generally a little piece of chaff as\r\na nucleus. He had also seen them taken from the bodies of monkeys. (Med.\r\nInd. c. 45.) See further Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 179, 136.) Now, it\r\nis certain that these Bezoars were much used in medicine by the Arabians\r\nas they are in the East at the present day; and yet, as far as we have\r\nbeen able to discover, they are not described in any of the Arabian works\r\non the Mat. Med., with the exception of Ebn Baithar, and his account\r\nof them is very indistinct and unsatisfactory. We may gather from his\r\ndescription, however, that the term was applied to more substances than\r\nthese alvine concretions. One of his authorities speaks of the best\r\nkind being found in the heart of the stag. Like all his countrymen, he\r\nrecommends the bezoar as an amulet and an antidote to poisons. (119.)\r\nIndeed the term Bezoar would appear to have been used as signifying\r\nalexipharmical. See Avicenna (ii, 2), and Serapion (c. 441.) Frequent\r\nmention of it occurs in the works of the Arabians. See Haly Abbas\r\n(pluries); Rhases (Cont. l. ult., and xxxv, 6, 8, 1); Avicenna (iv, 6, 1,\r\n4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Camphora._\r\n\r\nThis article is so important, that we shall be excused if we dwell upon\r\nit at some length. It is well known to be a secretion procured from\r\nseveral trees of the genus Laurus in the East; but more particularly\r\nfrom the tree which has been named _Camphora officinarum_. Serapion is\r\nthe ancient authority who gives the fullest account of Camphor. In the\r\nfirst place, owing no doubt to his using some interpolated translation\r\nof Dioscorides into Syriac, he quotes him as stating that it is procured\r\nfrom India and China and is produced in most abundance during seasons\r\nwhen there is much thunder. One of his Arabian authorities, Isaac\r\nEbn Amram, gives a distinct account of the origin of camphor and a\r\ndescription of the qualities of the different kinds of it, with a brief\r\nnotice of the mode of clarifying it by sublimation, which is the process\r\nby which it is still produced. As to its medicinal virtues, he holds it\r\nto be cold and dry in the second degree, and says it is applicable in\r\ncases of inflammations, vertigo, and cholera; in fumigations with myrrh,\r\nrose-oil, and sandal-wood; that it is anaphrodisiac, induces premature\r\nhoariness of the hair; that in a masticatory with lettuce, it cures the\r\nhot intemperament of the brain and induces sleep; removes vertigo; stops\r\nhemorrhages from the nose and all fluxes in general; and, in short, that\r\nit is a common ingredient in all fumigations and ointments. Rhases, as\r\nquoted by him, pronounces camphor to be cold and attenuate (volatile?);\r\nsays it is calculated to remove hot intemperaments in the head and the\r\nwhole body; when too much used that it induces insomnolency; that it\r\nbrings on coldness of the kidneys and bladder; coagulates the semen, and\r\nengenders coldness, and principally in the colder members of the body.\r\nAnother Arabian authority, Meseab, calls it cold and dry in the third\r\ndegree, and recommends it in epistaxis as a masticatory with raisins.\r\nMesarugie, another authority, says, in large doses it induces indigestion\r\nand stops the formation of semen. Another of his Arabian authorities,\r\nAben Mesuai (Mesue the elder?) says, it is astringent of the bowels,\r\ninduces premature hoariness of the hair, and is useful in hot apostemes.\r\nAben Amram, as quoted by him, says, Camphor is cold in the third degree,\r\nand is useful when applied to inflamed parts with rose-water, and\r\ncomforts the members of the body and the senses; and is useful in cholera\r\nalong with other astringents. He gives a quotation from the ‘Medicina\r\nAntiqua’ to this effect, that camphor is an astringent of the bowels,\r\nand that its use induces hoariness of the hairs. (De Simplicibus, 344.)\r\nAvicenna’s account of it is much more succinct; he describes several\r\nspecies of it; says it is procured from a very large tree capable of\r\ngiving shelter to a multitude of animals; that he had often seen the wood\r\nof it, and that it was white, brittle, light, and contained in its pores\r\nsome vestiges of camphor. He holds that its nature is cold and dry in the\r\nsecond degree. He recommends it in exactly the same cases as Serapion\r\ndoes, namely, in inflammatory complaints, epistaxis, hot vertigo, and\r\nacute ophthalmy. He also, like Serapion’s authorities, holds that it is\r\nanaphrodisiac and represses fluxes. (ii, 2, 130.) Rhases gives a brief\r\naccount of camphor upon the authority of Misib, Mesarguil, and Bimasui;\r\nthe first of whom merely recommends it in fluxes; the next relates of\r\nit that an acquaintance of his took six drachms of camphor at one dose,\r\nwhich impaired his digestion and brought on impotence without inducing\r\nany other complaint; the third, like some of Serapion’s authorities,\r\nrepresents it to be cold and dry in the third degree, and recommends it\r\nfor fluxes, and further says that it induces premature hoariness of the\r\nhair. (Contin. l. ult. i, 147.) In another work he calls it cold, humid,\r\nand subtile (volatile?), and gives it the same characters as the other\r\nauthorities. (Ad Mansor. iii, 22.) Mesue gives a formula for troches\r\nof camphor, which he recommends in ardent fevers, heat of the bile and\r\nof the blood, hot intemperaments of the stomach and of the liver, for\r\nintense thirst, jaundice, phthisis, and hectic. (De Trochiscis. i.) Haly\r\nAbbas frequently recommends camphor in the course of his works, but we\r\nhave not been able to discover any distinct account of it in the very\r\nbarbarous translation of his Materia Medica. Ebn Baithar gives a very\r\ncircumstantial account of the formation of camphor on the tree which\r\nproduces it, and describes its characters very accurately. He says it is\r\ncold and dry in the second degree, and is useful in hot intemperaments\r\nand bilious headaches. Like some of the others quoted above, he says\r\nit is produced most abundantly in times of thunder. In an over-dose,\r\nhe says, it is anaphrodisiac, and induces sleeplessness, and relates\r\na case in which it destroyed the tone of the stomach, and occasioned\r\nimpotence. He says it is used in collyria, and as a sternutatory, and\r\nto stop the hole in a carious tooth. Symeon Seth is the only one of the\r\nGreek authorities that treats fully of camphor (_caphura_.) He says it is\r\ncold and dry in the third degree; that it is the gum or tear of a tree\r\ngrowing in India; that the tree which produces it is said to be very\r\nlarge, so that a hundred men could be sheltered by its shade; that it is\r\nproduced on the mountains near the sea; and that the wood of the tree is\r\nlight and fistulous. He recommends camphor as being most useful in acute\r\ndiseases, in headaches from heat, and in inflammations, especially those\r\nof the liver; says that it induces coldness of the kidneys and spermatic\r\nvessels, and coagulates the blood. He mentions a test of its purity. (De\r\nAlimentis.) Myrepsus in one place mentions the herb camphor, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether he means the substance we are treating of;—most probably\r\nnot. (De Unguent, iii, 46.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassia Fistula._\r\n\r\nSerapion, in the first place, gives a pretty accurate description of\r\nit, and states the localities from which it is procured, namely, India,\r\nBabylonia, and Arabia. Upon the authority of Aben Mesuai he states it to\r\nbe of a sweet taste, and laxative of the bowels, and says it has virtues\r\nto extinguish the sharpness of the blood, that it relieves apostemes and\r\nboils in the mouth, and is useful in jaundice and pains of the liver. In\r\na dose of three to ten drachms he says it is cholagogue and laxative.\r\nAbengnefit, as quoted by him, says it purifies the nerves. Rhases,\r\nas quoted by him, says it is laxative and efficacious in apostemes,\r\nespecially those of the throat. (De Simpl. xii.) Avicenna’s account of\r\nit is but little different from that of Serapion. Having described it,\r\nhe says it is of an equal temperament as to heat and cold, but is of a\r\nmoistening nature, and that in action it is resolvent and laxative. It is\r\nuseful, he says, in hot apostemes of the bowels, and especially of the\r\nthroat when a gargle of it is prepared with a decoction of nightshade. He\r\npraises it in a liniment for gout and arthritic pains. He speaks well of\r\nit in dyspnœa. He says it cleanses the liver, and is of use in jaundice\r\nand pain of the liver. He says it is a gentle laxative, bringing away\r\nheated bile and phlegm, and opens the bowels safely without griping. (ii,\r\n2, 192.) Badagorius, as quoted by Rhases, says of cassia fistula, that\r\nit is alterative, an evacuant of bile, and a cleanser of the blood. The\r\nson of Mesue, as quoted by the same, recommends it, like Serapion, in\r\njaundice, pain of the liver, of the throat, &c. Priscianus, as quoted\r\nby Rhases, says it is a safe purgative to pregnant women, brings away\r\nbile, clears away jaundice, and is efficacious in pain of the liver and\r\nthroat. Marsenuce (?) recommends it in the same affections of the throat\r\nas the others. (Contin. l. ult. i, 187.) Of all the ancient authorities,\r\nMesue the younger gives the fullest account of it, but it is in nearly\r\nthe same terms as Serapion’s. His description of it is full and accurate.\r\nAny injurious action which it has, he says, may be removed by the mixture\r\nof myrobalans, rhubarb, the water of mastich, and spikenard; and in\r\ndryness of the bowels by mixing almond oil with it. Diuretics also are\r\nsaid to determine it to the urinary passages. He says it is useful to add\r\nsome laxative to it. As to its virtues, he says it cleanses the blood,\r\nallays all sharpness in it, assuages thirst, with the juice of endive,\r\n&c., clears the stomach, brings away yellow bile and phlegm, and that\r\nsafely, also purges the breast and throat, and is useful in heat of the\r\nkidneys, when taken with diuretics and the infusion of liquorice, that\r\nit prevents the formation of stones, and is useful in ardent fevers. (De\r\nSimpl. vi.) Ebn Baithar also gives a very elaborate and correct account\r\nof this article, but as it is nearly the same as that of Mesue, we need\r\nnot say much about it. He calls it a well-known tree growing in Egypt;\r\nsays in moderate doses it is a safe purgative, even to pregnant women,\r\nbut in large doses occasions hypercatharsis. If the root is not sound, it\r\nis apt to produce disturbance of the bowels. He says it purges hot bile,\r\nsoftens the breast, and cleanses the nerves, &c. (i, 401.) Actuarius\r\ndescribes it by the name of the Black Cassia, and recommends it as a\r\ngentle purgative both alone and with other medicines. (Meth. Med. v,\r\n2.) It occurs among the ingredients in the antidotes of Myrepsus. See\r\nAntidot. (i, xi.) Of course the article we have been treating of will be\r\nrecognised as being the _Cassia fistula_ L., the pudding-pipe tree, or\r\npurging cassia. The pulp of the pods is still sometimes used in medicine\r\nas a gentle purgative. See Paris (Pharmacol. i, 271); Pereira (M. M.\r\n1172); Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 150); Royle (M. M. 355.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Senna._\r\n\r\nIf the work of Serapion (De Simplicibus) which we possess, be the\r\nproduction of the elder Serapion (and after being long familiarly\r\nacquainted with it we are inclined to think so), he is undoubtedly\r\nthe first author who has described senna as an article of the Materia\r\nMedica. First on his own authority he describes very accurately the pods,\r\nstalks, and seeds of the plant. On the authority of Isaac Ebn Amram he\r\nrecommends it for removing the inquietude accompanying melancholy, for\r\naches and disturbances of the nerves, for alopecia, phthiriasis, chronic\r\nheadache, scabies, pustulæ parvæ, pruritus, and epilepsy. Abix, another\r\nauthority, declares it to have great power of purging black and yellow\r\nbile, and of acting as a cordial when mixed with suitable medicines such\r\nas violets. His last authority under this head is Rhases, who says that\r\nsenna and fumitory purge adust humours, and prove useful in scabies and\r\npruritus. (De Simpl. 58.) Under the head of _sahane_ Avicenna briefly\r\nnotices an article which he recommends as being abstergent and desiccant\r\nin pruritus and scabies, in pain of the neck, fetid breath, and watery\r\nstomach (waterbrash?). This account we are inclined to think must refer\r\nto senna. (ii, 2, 651.) Rhases gives almost exactly the same description\r\nof the _sahane_. (Contin. l. ult. i, 596.) In his work ‘Ad Mansor.’\r\n(viii, 54), he gives the account of _Sene_ quoted above from Serapion,\r\nand again at ‘Divis.’ (i, 144.) Haly Abbas describes it accurately\r\nin his chapter on Purgatives. (Pract. ii, 54.) He recommends it as a\r\nmedicine which purges both yellow and black bile, and is useful in gout\r\nand rheumatism, and in colics when mixed with raisins, oil of almonds,\r\n&c. Mesue describes senna as the folliculus of a plant resembling the\r\ntare. The best part of the plant, he says, is the folliculus (legume?),\r\nand next the leaves; and both these parts are said to be best when of\r\na green colour. As senna has a tendency to weaken the stomach by its\r\noperation, he recommends it to be mixed with ginger, sal gem, Indian\r\nsalt (sugar?), and cordials. He quotes Galen (through some mistake, as\r\nis generally supposed) as recommending it boiled in the soup of fowls.\r\nHe also speaks of giving it in whey, or in milk, or in must, that is to\r\nsay, the fresh juice of the grape. The last of these preparations he\r\npraises as cleansing the brain and senses, and creating joy. He also\r\nspeaks favorably of a decoction of it with prunes and spikenard. As to\r\nits virtues, he says it readily purges black and adust bile, cleanses the\r\nbrain, heart, liver, spleen, the senses, and lungs, proves deobstruent\r\nand dispels sorrow. He also speaks favorably of the leaves when applied\r\nto the head in the bath as improving the senses of sight and hearing, and\r\nas proving a remedy to fevers arising from black bile, and to chronic\r\nfevers. (De Simpl. xv.) Ebn Baithar gives an interesting description\r\nof it. He says in Arabia it is used as a dye, and that its leaves are\r\nmixed with those of the plant now called _Lawsonia inermis_. He calls it\r\ncholagogue and melanogogue, says it penetrates the inferior extremities,\r\nand purges them in cases of gout. He also praises it in scabies,\r\nepilepsy, and a great many other diseases. By some mistake he quotes\r\nPaulus. He says it is better in decoction than in powder. The dose of the\r\nlatter is from two to three drachms, of the former from four to seven\r\ndrachms. (i, 57.) Actuarius says of _sene_, that it purges moderately in\r\ndoses of one drachm. (Meth. Med. v, 8.) _Sene_ occurs as an ingredient in\r\nseveral of the antidotes of Myrepsus, as c. 112, 465, 472. Under this\r\nhead we would beg, before concluding, to refer the reader to Ainslie’s\r\nMat. Ind. (i, 205). It will be there seen that in Æthiopia senna is still\r\nused as a dye.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berberis._\r\n\r\nRhases gives extracts from Badigorius, Oribasius, Mesue, and others\r\non the virtues of this substance, which he represents as being\r\nlithontriptic, styptic, and alexipharmic. He says it is called _calmuris_\r\nin Greek. (Contin. l. ult. i, 121.) Serapion gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides and Galen under this head, but there seems no reason to\r\nsuppose that they were at all acquainted with this article. He recommends\r\nit as being cooling and incisive, and a strengthener of the stomach and\r\nliver. He also praises it in all fluxes. (De Simpl. 229.) Ebn Baithar\r\ncalls it astringent, stomachic, and hepatic, and says it binds the bowels\r\nand quenches thirst. He recommends it in diarrhœa connected with weakness\r\nof the liver, and in diseases of the stomach and uterus. See also\r\nAvicenna (vi, 9.) The berberry (_Berberis vulgaris_) is recommended by\r\nGerard, Parkinson, and all our old herbalists as an astringent medicine\r\nin diseases of the stomach and liver. Even at the present day it is\r\nadmitted to possess these virtues. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 102)\r\nand Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 438.) The former of these seems to acknowledge\r\nit as the _Oxyacantha_ of the Greeks, but we think incorrectly. Dr. Royle\r\nsupposes the _Lycium Indicum_ of Dioscorides to be the berberry. It seems\r\nto us more probable, however, that the berberry was but the succedaneum\r\nof the lycium. See Schröder (Chemical Dispensatory, 475.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galanga._\r\n\r\nRhases calls it stomachic. (Antid. iii.) Serapion having described it,\r\nupon the authority of Isaac ebn Amram says of it, that it is hot and dry\r\nin the third degree, is useful to phlegmatic persons, and in humidity\r\nof the stomach (waterbrash?); promotes digestion by its heat and the\r\nsolution which it occasions in the stomach, and thus relieves colic,\r\ngives fragrance to the breath, and warms the kidneys; it sets the semen\r\nin commotion, and when a piece of it is held in the mouth, it occasions\r\nerections of the _membrum virile_. The same virtues in the same cases are\r\nassigned to it by Aben Mesuai, and also Aben Mesabah, who recommends it\r\nin flatulent colic and eructations. (De Simpl. 332.) Avicenna, having\r\ndescribed it, delivers the same account of its medicinal powers as\r\nSerapion, that is to say, he holds it to be hot and dry in the second\r\ndegree, of subtile parts and carminative, says that it renders the breath\r\nfragrant, is good for the stomach, promotes digestion, is useful in colic\r\nand pains of the kidneys, and is aphrodisiacal. (ii, 2, 314; v, 2, 6.)\r\nThe same account of it is given by “the Son of Mesue,” in the ‘Continens’\r\nof Rhases (l. ult. i, 323.) In the pharmaceutical work of Myrepsus there\r\nis an “antidotus a Galanga,” which is said to be beneficial in affections\r\nof the stomach and spleen, and in indigestion; also for singultus,\r\nacidity of the food in the stomach, cachexia, dropsy, and coldness of\r\nthe whole body: it contains cloves, ginger, cinnamon, galangal, &c. (i,\r\n63; also, 222.) Ebn Baithar ascribes the same virtues to it as Serapion;\r\nthus he says it is a wonderful aphrodisiac, promotes digestion, cures\r\ncolic, is carminative, and so forth. Although now little used, galangal\r\nroot is not yet wholly unknown to the writers on the Materia Medica. Dr.\r\nPereira says of “_radix galangæ officinalis_; its odour is agreeably\r\naromatic, its taste peppery and aromatic. It is the rhizome of the\r\n_Alpinia Galanga_ Roxb.” (Mat. Med. 698.) See also Lewis (Mat. Med. 452);\r\nHill (Mat. Med. i, 447); Quincy (72); Gray (Suppl. to the Pharmacop. 26);\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 166.) There are two species of galangal, which Dr.\r\nLindley refers to the _alpinia racemosa_ and _galanga_. He says of them,\r\n“the warm and pungent roots of the greater and lesser galangals are not\r\nonly used by the Indian doctors, but are considered useful in coughs,\r\ngiven in infusion.” (Ibid.) On the Galangal see further Ainslie (Mat.\r\nInd., i, 140.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zeduaria_ and _Zerumbeth_.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this subject it will be necessary in the first\r\nplace to see the descriptions of these substances given by modern\r\nauthorities. Dr. Pereira says of the former of these: “The Zeduary root\r\n(_Radix Zeduariæ officinalis_) of English druggists appears to me to\r\nagree with Professor Guibourt’s description of _round Zeduary_ (Zeduaria\r\nrotunda). It is the sliced tuber of _Curcuma Zeduaria_ Rox. It has\r\na warm, aromatic, bitter taste, and an aromatic odour.” (Mat. Med.\r\n698.) And of the Zerumbet the same author says: “_Cassamunar root_ is\r\nconsidered by English druggests to be identical with _Zerumbet root_.\r\n(Private information; also, Gray, Pharmacop.) It appears to me to be\r\nthe _Turmeric-coloured Zeduary_ of Ainslie (Mat. Ind. i, 490.) Is it\r\nthe product of _Zinziber Cassamuniar_ Roxb.? The Zerumbet root which I\r\nreceived from my friend Dr. Royle is very similar in shape to a curved\r\nand arched piece of long turmeric.” (Mat. Med. 698.) Dr. Ainslie gives\r\nan interesting disquisition on the Zeduary of which he describes three\r\nspecies: 1. Zeduary Kæmpferian (_Kæmpferia rotunda_.) 2. Zeduary Zerumbet\r\n(_Curcuma Zerumbet_.) 3. Zeduary turmeric-coloured (_Curcuma_ and _Amomum\r\nZeduaria_.) We shall now be better able to ascertain the meaning of the\r\nancient descriptions of these substances. Serapion describes separately\r\nthe _Zerumbet Zeduaria_ and _Zerumbet_, but in such terms that one is\r\nat a loss to see any real distinction between them. (De Simpl. 172,\r\n271.) He calls Zeduary an odoriferous tree for which cinnamon is often\r\nsubstituted. He refers to Galen and Paulus, but what passages in their\r\nworks he alludes to it is not easy to discover. He describes it as\r\nbeing a great tree which grows on Mount Lebanon, and produces no fruit,\r\nbut has the odour of citron, and is hot and dry in its nature, and is\r\nastringent so as both to open and astringe the bowels. Mesarugie, one\r\nof his authorities, compares its virtues to those of nutmeg; praises it\r\nas being sternutatory, and also stomachic and hepatic. This, without\r\ndoubt, is the Zeduary, and the _Zarnabum_ of Avicenna, who describes it\r\nseparately from the Zerumbet, but mentions that the latter is much the\r\nsame as the Zeduary. (ii, 2, 736, 738.) Rhases, in like manner, compares\r\nthe Zerumbet to the Zeduary as being possessed of similar powers. He\r\ntreats most fully of the former, recommending it as being alexipharmic, a\r\ngood application to apostemes, &c. (Contin. l. ult. ii, 765.) Ebn Baithar\r\ntreats fully of the Zerumbeth, which he describes minutely, and compares\r\nit to the great Cyperus. He says it is called camphor-root in the West.\r\nHe calls it alexipharmical, cordial, intoxicating; an excellent medicine\r\nin inflation of the uterus, and possessed of emmenagogue and diuretic\r\npowers. He says it is good in affections of the liver and surrounding\r\nparts. It is said to determine downwards when applied to the soles of\r\nthe feet in complaints of the head, to prove useful in leprosy when\r\nrubbed into the part affected, and to remove impotence. He also treats\r\nseparately, and at considerable length, of the _Zeduaria nigra_. (ii,\r\n95.) From the above account it will be seen that these two substances\r\nwere nearly allied to one another, and in fact there is no doubt that\r\nthe one was often taken for the other. See further Moses Charras (Royal\r\nPharmacop. 68); Gray (Pharmacop. 26.) The Zeduary was often used as\r\na succedaneum for the costus (Pemberton, Dispensatory, 340) in the\r\ncomposition of the Mithridate, and hence these two substances have been\r\nsometimes erroneously taken for the same. See also Manardus ad Mesue (De\r\nTrochiscis, 154); and Quincy (English Dispensatory, 483.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amomum Grana Paradisi._\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that this is the article which Ebn Baithar\r\nmeans to describe (i, 272). He calls it a spicy plant which comes out\r\nof Yemen and India. He describes two kinds, and says of them that\r\nthey are hot, fragrant, and astringent, and hence prove stomachic and\r\npromote digestion. He says they are useful in epilepsy and faintings,\r\nand cure headaches in a sternutatory. He describes the smaller kind as\r\nbeing weaker but more attenuant than the larger. We are not aware of\r\nthe grains of paradise, or Guinea grains, as they are sometimes called,\r\nbeing described by any other of the ancient authorities. We need scarcely\r\nremark that they are now well known, and occasionally used in the\r\npractice of medicine. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 27); Pereira (Mat. Med.\r\n697); Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 167.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Macis_ and _Nux moschata_.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in the proper place that the _Macer_ of the Greeks and\r\nRomans was not mace. The Arabian authorities, it is true, in describing\r\n_Mace_ quote what the Greeks had written on _Macer_, but this does not\r\nprove their identity, for many such instances of confused reference occur\r\nin their works. Avicenna says, upon the authority of Mesue, that mace\r\nis the cortex (meaning, of course, the involucre) of nux moschata. He\r\nrecommends it as a good stomachic, hepatic, and uterine medicine, and\r\nsays it proves an astringent in fluxes of the bowels and in dysentery\r\n(ii, 2, 448.) The nutmeg, or nucleus of the _myristica officinalis_, he\r\nsays, is of the size of a gall, brittle, having a fine rind (involucre),\r\nand a sharp smell. He recommends it as a styptic in complaints of the\r\nliver, spleen, and stomach, and in difficulty of urine. In oils he says\r\nit is a sedative of pain, and also in pessaries, and it stops vomiting.\r\n(ii, 2, 495.) He quotes no Greek authorities under this head. Rhases,\r\nin his ‘Continens,’ says briefly of the nux moschata, that it resembles\r\ncloves, and is good for the stomach and liver. (l. ult. 507.) In his\r\nother work (Ad Mansor. iii, 30,) he calls it hot and dry, and recommends\r\nit as an astringent in coldness of the stomach and liver. Mesue, in his\r\nelectuary of lignum aloes, which he recommends for affections of the\r\nheart, stomach, and coldness of the liver, mentions nutmeg and mace as\r\ntwo of its ingredients. (De Electariis, i.) The ancient writer, however,\r\nwho gives the fullest account of these articles is Serapion, who under\r\nthis head quotes only from Arabian authorities, namely, Aaron, Isaac ebn\r\nAmram, Aben Mesuai, Miseaben, Albasari, and Rhases. They all agree in\r\nrepresenting them to be aromatic and astringent, useful in flatulence\r\nand other complaints of the stomach, in fetid breath, indigestion, and\r\nenlargements of the spleen and liver. (De Simpl. 161.) Ebn Baithar’s\r\nextracts under this head are principally from Rhases and Avicenna. He\r\nevidently disapproves of the opinion of those that held _Macer_ and\r\n_Mace_ to be identical. On the nutmeg and mace we would beg to refer to\r\nAinslie (Mat. Ind. 202, 249.) It will be there seen that the Hindoos\r\nstill use these articles as cardiac, hepatic, and stomachic medicines.\r\nIt appears doubtful to us whether the Greeks and Romans were at all\r\nacquainted with the nutmeg. For we have always suspected the genuineness\r\nof the last chapter but one of Aëtius, which contains a number of\r\nIndian aromatics not to be found elsewhere in the works of the Greek\r\nauthorities. Our suspicions, which are of old date, have been much\r\nstrengthened by the discovery that many of the formulæ contained in that\r\nchapter as given in the Latin translation are wanting in the two MSS.\r\nof Aëtius in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. This we have positively\r\nascertained through the kindness of Dr. Greenhill, who examined this\r\npart of these MSS. at our request to ascertain the fact. It may be well\r\nto take this opportunity of stating that with the original of the last\r\neight books of Aëtius we have no personal acquaintance further than from\r\na cursory examination of these MSS. during a very brief visit to Oxford\r\nin 1845. In the MS. named ‘Canon. Gr.’ (109), the nuces Indicæ are called\r\nκάρυα Ινδικά. From what we have stated above, it must now be obvious that\r\nwe have arrived at the positive conclusion that the νάσκαφθον of the\r\nGreek Mat. Med. was not mace. (See the Commentary on this article.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nux Indica._\r\n\r\nAccording to Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 268) the first mention of the _Cocos\r\nnucifera_, or cocoa-nut, occurs in the Itinerary of Abuzeid and Wahab.\r\nNo mention of it is made in the works of the Greek writers on medicine.\r\nThe Arabians describe it minutely as an article of food, so that it ought\r\nto have been noticed by us in our Commentary on the 81st sect. of Book\r\nI. Rhases treats of it very fully as a dietetical article, and also as\r\na medicine, saying of it that it purges away the tapeworm, that the oil\r\nof it is useful both internally and externally in pains and flatulence\r\nof the back, loins, knees, and in hemorrhoids; and he further quotes\r\nBemasuy in confirmation of this character of it. All his authorities held\r\nit to be a hot and dry medicine. (Cont. l. ult. i, 506.) Avicenna gives,\r\nalmost word for word, the same account of it. The flesh of the cocoa-nut,\r\nhe says, is intensely white, and its juice sweet; and when there is not\r\nmuch juice in it, we are to understand that it is old. The inner bark,\r\nhe says, is to be taken off, as being wholly indigestible. He recommends\r\nit in exactly the same complaints as Rhases does, only as a vermifuge he\r\ndoes not say that its oil brings away the tapeworm, but ascarides and\r\nlumbrici. (ii, 2, 498.) Serapion gives a somewhat fuller description\r\nof the cocoa-nut, which he knew to be the fruit of a palm-tree, but\r\notherwise his account of it is the same as that of the two authorities\r\nalready quoted. Of his Arabian authorities, one says that it is laxative,\r\nand another that it is astringent. (De Simpl. 228.) Haly Abbas recommends\r\nthe Nux Indica as a comforter of the nerves in hemicrania, paralysis,\r\nand epilepsy. (Pract. ii, 38, 248.) Mesue notices the “oleum ex nuce\r\nIndica,” which, he says, is useful in nervous pains, purges the lungs\r\nand chest, clears the voice, fattens, and engenders semen. (De Oleis,\r\ni.) Ebn Baithar gives an interesting account of the cocoa-palm both\r\nas a medicine and an article of food. He says its milk is at times\r\nintoxicating and aphrodisiac, and that it is useful in certain complaints\r\nof the urine, in tænia and other intestinal worms. The reader will\r\nfind it interesting to compare the above account of the cocoa from the\r\nancient authorities with what Ainslie says of it in his work, ‘Materia\r\nIndica,’ i, 451; and Dr. Lindley in his late admirable publication on the\r\n‘Vegetable Kingdom,’ (136.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bdellium._\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that under this head Avicenna (ii, 2, 112), and\r\nother oriental writers, have included either that species of Palm called\r\n_Borassus flabelliformis_; or another congener, _Hyphæne Thebaica_. See\r\nSprengel (R. H. H. i, 272); Ainslie (Mat. Ind. i, 452); Royle (Antiq.\r\nof Hindoo Med. 90); Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 136.) The term, however, was\r\napplied to other substances, as we have stated under the proper head.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tamarindi._\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that we are indebted to the Arabians for our first\r\nknowledge of this important medicine. Serapion, in describing this\r\narticle, quotes only from Arabian authorities, which implies that he\r\nheld the Greeks to have been unacquainted with it. Its leaves are said\r\nto resemble those of the willow. His first authority, Abohanifa, says it\r\ngrows in Cæsaria; and his next, Aben Mesuai, says its fruit, which is of\r\na ruddy colour, and has much pulp, is brought from India. In temperament\r\nit is said to be cold in the third degree, and has the power of purging\r\nyellow bile gently, and of repressing its pungency; of stopping vomiting,\r\nand removing pruritus. His other authorities, Abugerig, Mesebab, and\r\nMesarugie, give a similar account of it. (De Simpl. 348.) Rhases writes\r\nof it in nearly the same terms: thus, he says, it extinguishes yellow\r\nbile, opens the bowels, removes thirst and vomiting, and strengthens the\r\nstomach. Its action is said to be similar to that of prunes. (Contin. l.\r\nult. i, 699.) On his own authority Rhases says of Tamarinds in another\r\nplace, that they are of a cold nature, loosen the bowels, repress intense\r\nbile and blood. (Ad Mansor. iii, 49.) Avicenna calls Tamarinds cold and\r\ndry in the second degree, says they are laxative, and more attenuant\r\nthan prunes, and contain less juice: that they stop excessive vomiting,\r\nand thirst in fevers, and brace the stomach when it is relaxed. They\r\nare beneficial, he adds, in syncoptic fevers, and other disorders in\r\nwhich it is necessary to open the bowels gently. (ii, 2, 691.) Mesue\r\ndescribes Tamarinds as being acidulous dates, or the fruit of wild\r\npalms growing in India. He gives a very minute description of them,\r\nwhich we need not copy. As to temperament he says, they are cold and\r\ndry in the second degree; and in order to correct their bad effects in\r\ncold affections of the stomach, he directs them to be mixed with mace,\r\nspikenard, mastich, fennel, parsley, endive, &c. He further directs their\r\naction to be increased by giving them in the whey of goats, the infusion\r\nof fumitory or of hops. He gives very minute directions for preparing\r\nTamarind whey, both simple and compound. As to its virtues, he says, it\r\nbrings away bile, represses the ebullition of it, and the heat of the\r\nblood, is beneficial in inflammation of the liver and stomach, quenches\r\nthirst, removes all heat connected with it, is useful in jaundice, stops\r\nvomiting, and is a good medicine in acute fevers which require to be\r\nrepressed. Being of a weak nature, Tamarinds, he says, require to be\r\ngiven to the amount of from two to five ounces. (De Simpl.) Ebn Baithar’s\r\ndescription of Tamarinds is full and accurate, but does not contain\r\nanything of importance in addition to the information which we have\r\nextracted from the other authorities who preceded him. (See Vol. I, 212.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myrobalani._\r\n\r\nWe have stated under the head of _Balanus_, that the Greek authorities\r\nbefore the Arabian period were entirely unacquainted with the stone\r\nfruits which now bear the name of _Myrobalans_. As these substances are\r\nnow scarcely known in this country, we shall find it convenient again,\r\nin the present instance, to give, in the first place, a brief account\r\nof them from modern authorities. They are well described by Geoffroy,\r\nAlston, the Commentators on Mesue, and many other writers on the Mat.\r\nMed. They held a place in the British Dispensatory as late as the time\r\nof Quincy, and are described by Boerhaave in his Mat. Med. They have not\r\nlately been used in the practice of medicine either in Europe, or by our\r\nEnglish physicians in the East Indies, as far as we have been able to\r\nlearn. Five species are described by all writers on them, both ancient\r\nand modern, namely, the Citrine, Belleric, Chebulic, Emblic, and Indian.\r\nFor a particular description of them see Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 262);\r\nAinslie (Mat. Ind. i, 236), and Royle (Antiq. of Hindoo Med.) According\r\nto the last of these authors, the Black _or_ Indian, the Yellow _or_\r\nCitrine, and the Chebulic, are the product of the _Terminalia Chebula_;\r\nthe fourth _or_ Beleric, of the T. Belerica, all belonging to the natural\r\ntribe of medicines now called Combretaceæ; while the fifth _or_ Emblic is\r\nthe fruit of the _Phyllanthus Emblica_, now called _Emblica officinalis_.\r\nSee Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 280.) We shall now be able to apprehend the\r\ndescriptions of the ancient authors.\r\n\r\nRhases quotes several Arabian and Indian authorities on Myrobalans.\r\nThe Citrine _or_ Yellow, according to Badigorias (Pythagoras?), is\r\ncholagogue, and the Black stomachic. The other authorities quoted by him\r\nagree in generally holding that myrobalans are cholagogue and stomachic,\r\nand that they are useful in hemorrhoids and palpitation of the heart.\r\nSarac, the Indian, recommends them as purgative and stomachic medicines\r\nin mental diseases, hemorrhoids, headache, dropsy, and diseases of\r\nthe spleen. They all seem to be agreed in holding that myrobalans are\r\npossessed of a purgative power compounded with astringency. (Contin. l.\r\nult. i, 473.) In his other works he recommends myrobalans for purging\r\nyellow bile, and melancholy or black bile, and also as astringents.\r\n(Divis. i, 144, and Ad Mansor. viii, 54.) In the latter work he says,\r\nthat in order to purge, the proper dose of citrine myrobalans is from\r\nten to twenty drachms. Avicenna describes four species of myrobalans,\r\nnamely, the Citrine, unripe, the black Indian, the Kebulic, and the\r\nChinese, meaning by the last, we suppose, the Emblic, or fruit of the\r\n_Emblica officinalis_. He describes minutely their specific differences,\r\nand states of their general virtues as medicines, that they are cold in\r\nthe first degree and dry in the second; that they all extinguish yellow\r\nbile, and are useful in bilious complaints; that the black brightens\r\nthe colour, and all kinds are useful in leprosy. He recommends them\r\nin diseases of the eyes, and in those of the chest accompanied with\r\npalpitation and sorrow. He also states several minute distinctions among\r\nthem as to medicinal powers, which we do not think it necessary to enter\r\nupon. (ii, 2, 449.) Serapion writes very elaborately on myrobalans,\r\nof which he describes four species, the Citrine, the Black or Indian,\r\nthe Kebulic, and the Chinese citrine (Emblic?). The authorities quoted\r\nby him are generally agreed, that myrobalans possess astringency\r\nwith bitterness, purge bile and whet the stomach; are cordial, and\r\nprove useful in melancholy, &c. Sarac, the Indian, as quoted by him,\r\nmaintains of myrobalans, that they are hot and astringent, and at\r\nthe same time eccoprotic, that they strengthen the senses and the\r\nnerves, are useful in leprosy, colic, old hemorrhoids, vertigo, and\r\ndropsy, and that they induce nausea and vomiting. Honain gives minute\r\ndirections for the preparation of them, but these we shall not enter\r\nupon. Some apothecaries, he says, fall into the mistake of selling\r\nKebulic myrobalans of a black colour for the true black kind. For the\r\ntrue black myrobalans, he says, are brought from India, whereas of the\r\nKebulic, some are yellow and others black according to the time of\r\ntheir growth at which they are gathered from the trees. He gives very\r\nminute directions for administering them with other substances, such\r\nas prunes, Sebesten plums, jujubes, and the like; but as most of these\r\nsubstances are not now much known, it would not be interesting to most\r\nreaders to learn his remarks on this subject. (De Simpl. 107.) Mesue\r\nalso gives a very elaborate and circumstantial account of myrobalans,\r\nwhich our necessary limits prevent us from giving at full length. He\r\nranks them with the Blessed Medicines (_medicinis benedictis_); for,\r\nhe adds, in loosening the bowels, they do not weaken but strengthen\r\nthe stomach, heart, liver, and the whole body. The only bad effect, he\r\nsays, which they ever produce, is obstruction. Their operation, he adds,\r\nis wonderfully increased by combining them with scammony. He says, of\r\nall the kinds, that they are cold in the first degree and dry in the\r\nsecond. His directions for correcting any bad effects from the use of\r\nthem, and for increasing their operation, are most circumstantial, and\r\nbespeak an intimate acquaintance with the subject. He eulogises them\r\nin the strongest terms, declaring that they restore youth, improve the\r\ncomplexion, the breath, and the perspiration, impart joy and hilarity,\r\nstrengthen the stomach, heart, and liver, are useful in palpitations,\r\ncleanse the stomach, are useful in hemorrhoids, extinguish heat in\r\ncholera, and this more especially the citrine. He also speaks favorably\r\nof them in a prescribed preparation for complaints of the eyes, and\r\nfor tertian and bilious fevers. The Kebulic, he says, are phlegmagogue,\r\nand especially the prepared kinds; they improve the sight, cleanse\r\nand comfort the stomach, and are useful in dropsy and chronic fevers.\r\nThe Black bring away black and adust bile, are useful in melancholy\r\nand palpitations, clear the colour, cure leprosy, remove sadness, and\r\nare beneficial in quartans. The dose from two to five drachms. (De\r\nSimpl. ii.) He treats separately of the Emblic and Belleric, but we\r\nneed not enter upon his account of them. And here we would refer our\r\nreaders to Costa’s commentary on this part of Mesue, as containing all\r\nthe interesting information which can be gleaned from ancient authors\r\non the subject of myrobalans. For the other Arabians, see Haly Abbas\r\n(Pract. ii, 54); Averrhoes (Collig. v, 42); Ebn Baithar (pluries); and\r\nAvenzoar (Antidot.) None of these supply much that is important after\r\nwhat we have given from the other authorities. Of the Greek writers on\r\nmedicine, Actuarius is the only one that gives any distinct account of\r\nmyrobalans, and he professes to derive his information from “the wise\r\nbarbarian doctors,” meaning the Arabians. He first describes the Citrine,\r\nthe Kebulic, and the Black or Indian, and represents them as possessing\r\npurgative powers, combined with some astringency and tonicity. Besides\r\nthese three kinds he mentions, as possessing purgative powers of a like\r\nnature, two medicines, which he calls _empelilez_ and _empletze_, by\r\nwhich he no doubt meant Emblic and Belleric. (Meth. Med. v, 8.) The\r\nfive kinds of myrobalans, namely, the Citrine, the Kebulic, the Indian,\r\nthe Belleric, and the Emblic, occur in one of the antidotes of Nicolas\r\nMyrepsus, who recommends them in various remittent and intermittent\r\nfevers. (i, 24.) Myrobalans have always been much esteemed by the Hindoo\r\nphysicians. See the Susruta, and Wise’s Book on Hindoo Medicine (pluries.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manna._\r\n\r\nThough the Arabians would certainly appear to have been the first to\r\nintroduce the substance now used medicinally under this name, it is\r\nimpossible to believe that the Greeks and Romans can have been wholly\r\nunacquainted with it. It, we need scarcely inform our professional\r\nreaders, is procured principally from the _Ornus Europæa_ or flowering\r\nash, either by incision, or the puncture of an insect. The ancients,\r\nhowever, applied this term to a variety of the _thus_, as we have stated\r\nin the preceding commentary on this section, and also to the _honey-dew_\r\ndescribed in Vol. I, pp. 178, 179 of this work. We have further mentioned\r\nunder the head of _Elæomeli_, that it probably was some species of manna.\r\nAltogether then the term we are now considering is often a puzzle in\r\nreading the works of the ancient authorities. See further Ainslie (Mat.\r\nInd. i, 209); Sprengel (R. H. H.); Pereira (M. M. 928); Lindley (Veg.\r\nKingd. 547, 617, 737, 341, 342.) Even the Arabians, who appear to have\r\nbeen perfectly well acquainted with its medicinal properties, confound it\r\nwith the honey-dew, and seem to say that it falls from heaven upon the\r\ntrees. Serapion describes it by the name of _Tereniaben_ or mel roris,\r\nand says it falls from above upon certain trees, and resembles granulated\r\nhoney. Its virtues he states, upon the authority of Isaac ebn Amram, to\r\nconsist in opening the bowels, and moistening the chest, and he adds that\r\nit suits with persons of a hot temperament, especially when dissolved\r\nin water of jujubes, or of prunes. His other authorities recommend it\r\nin the same complaints, and also in the inflammation of ardent fevers\r\nand for quenching thirst. The dose is said to be from ten to twenty\r\ndrachms. (De Simpl. 10.) We may mention that Serapion and all the other\r\nauthorities mention that manna is found most abundantly on thorns.\r\nAvicenna’s account of this subject is so like to that of Serapion that\r\nit would be superfluous to give any abstract of it. (ii, 2, 694.) Rhases\r\nalso gives nearly the same description of manna upon the authority of\r\nAbinerog, Mesaurice, Mesue, and Chuz. (Contin. l. ult. i, 711.) All these\r\nauthorities represent it as being a gentle purgative and expectorant,\r\nand as being useful in acute and intermittent fevers. In another of\r\nhis works (Ad Mansor. ix, 14), treating of hoarseness and coryza, he\r\nprescribes an expectorant decoction, one of the ingredients of which is\r\n“_manna_, quam aërium appellant.” In his chapter on angina (ix, 51) he\r\nprescribes a laxative medicine containing tamarinds, cassia fistula, and\r\n“_manna_ quam veteres mel aërium appellant.” Mesue gives an elaborate\r\naccount of the origin, characters, temperament, and virtues of manna,\r\nwhich is well worth consulting, although it contains nothing of any\r\ngreat importance in addition to what is stated above on the authority of\r\nSerapion, Avicenna, and Rhases. He would appear moreover to confound the\r\n_manna thuris_ with the manna of the ash. Like the other authorities, he\r\nholds manna to be a gentle cholagogue, and says it softens the throat,\r\nthe chest, the bowels, and quenches thirst. The dose from six to fifteen\r\ndrachms. (De Simpl. 8.) We have not found anything further of interest in\r\nthe works of Averrhoes, Haly Abbas, and Ebn Baithar. The last of these\r\nsays the Ros Melleus is a substance which falls upon trees in Chorasan;\r\nthat it is useful in ardent fevers, moistens the chest, proves more\r\ndetergent than sugar, cools thirst, improves the memory, purges yellow\r\nbile, &c. He evidently alludes to the true manna of the ash. Actuarius\r\nmentions cassia fistula and manna as two purgative medicines which may be\r\nsafely given to children and pregnant women. (Meth. Med. v.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turpeth._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that it is the _Convolvulus Turpethum_. Rhases\r\nrecommends turpeth for purging crude and recrementitious humours from the\r\nknees and other joints. His two authorities, Mesue the elder, and Chuz,\r\ngive it the same character. (Contin. l. ult. i, 729.) Avicenna, after\r\ndescribing it, represents it as being efficacious in diseases of the\r\nnerves and joints, as being phlegmagogue, and if mixed with ginger, as\r\nbringing away crude humours. (ii, 2, 701.) Serapion confounds it with the\r\ntripolium of Dioscorides and Galen, as we have stated under that head.\r\nUpon the authority of Aben Mesuai he assigns it the property of purging\r\nviscid phlegm, but says that it brings on mental depression by its horrid\r\ntaste, and, therefore, it ought not to be taken alone. Other Arabian\r\nauthorities, quoted by him, give it the same character. He describes the\r\nmedicine very minutely, and the marks by which we may determine whether\r\nit be sound or not. The dose is from one to two drachms. (De Simpl.\r\n337.) Haly Abbas treats of it in his chapter on purgatives, but confines\r\nhimself principally to a description of the medicine itself. (Pract. ii,\r\n2, 557.) The ancient author who has treated most fully of turpeth, is\r\nMesue the younger in his work ‘De Simpl.’ (11.) He gives a circumstantial\r\ndescription of it, and full directions for correcting its bad\r\nqualities by mixing it with other substances, such as scammony, dates,\r\nginger, almonds, &c. He recommends it principally as a phlegmagogue,\r\nand an evacuant of gross humours in diseases of the joints, and as a\r\npreservative from leprosy and other diseases of the skin. It has been\r\nmuch disputed whether or not the turpeth of Mesue be the same as that of\r\nthe other Arabians. (See his Commentators l. c.) We see little reason for\r\nquestioning their identity. We have not found anything additional of much\r\ninterest in the great work of Ebn Baithar under this head. The turpeth of\r\nActuarius is the root of the pityusa, that is to say of the _Euphorbia\r\npityusa_. (Meth. Med. v, 9.) Dr. Ainslie, treating of the _Convolvulus\r\nturpethum_, says: “Our present article had long a place in the Mat. Med.,\r\nbut of late years has fallen into disuse. Alston (M. M. ii, 530) speaks\r\nof turpeth as being a strong resinous cathartic, recommended in his days\r\nin gout, dropsy, and leprosy.” (Mat. Ind. ii, 384.) It is still known\r\nin the shops as a rough purgative. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharm.) We are\r\nsatisfied that it was not known to the Greeks before the Arabian period,\r\nthat it was neither the Tripolium, as we have already stated, nor yet\r\nthe Alypias, as some have supposed. It has been long used as a purgative\r\nmedicine by the Hindoo physicians. See Wise (Hindoo Med. 145.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dende._\r\n\r\nSerapion gives a very lengthened account of the _Dend hayse_, and\r\ndescribes two species of it. He speaks of part of it being poisonous, and\r\nstates that it purges strongly, and induces tenesmus. A person who has\r\ntaken of it is directed to vomit, to take butter and milk in drink with\r\nastringents of a demulcent nature, such as purslane, gum Arabic, &c. He\r\nmentions that it is a medicinal herb much used in India and Babylonia,\r\nalong with other purgatives, but he adds that it induces great debility\r\nin that hot and dry country, whereas in Yemen, where the heat is attended\r\nwith great rains, no class of medicines answer so well as that which\r\npossesses astringent and laxative powers combined, such as turpeth,\r\nmyrobalans, manna, and the like. But _dend_, he says, answers only in\r\ncold countries like Seni (China?). When it brought on hypercatharsis, he\r\nsays, he directed his patient to sit in a cold hip-bath, and to get cold\r\nwater dashed over his body. (De Simpl. 388.) Avicenna’s description of\r\n_dende_ is mostly taken from Serapion. He directs it to be administered\r\nonly in a cold country, and along with substances calculated to restrain\r\nits violent operations, such as starch and saffron. He says it purges\r\nhumours and phlegm from the joints. (ii, 2, 215.) We have not been\r\nable to discover any traces of it in the works of Haly Abbas, Rhases,\r\nMesue, nor Averrhoes. Ebn Baithar, however, treats of it fully. He\r\nsays, or at least his German translator makes him say, that it is the\r\n_Ricinus_, and not an _Euphorbia_, as some had supposed. He gives a\r\nminute description of three kinds—the Chinese, the Indian, and the\r\nArboreus; and of these the first is said to be the best and strongest in\r\nits purgative operation. It is said to be hot, sharp, and oily, and to\r\npurge the body effectually, especially the humours in the joints. It is\r\nnot given, he says, in hot countries, such as Irak, the sea-coast, the\r\nland of Egypt, and Yemen, because fluxes in these countries are common,\r\nand owing to the relaxation of the body, it cannot bear this violent\r\nmedicine. One of his authorities, Honain, wisely remarks that in all\r\nhot countries severe medicines ought to be avoided. Minute directions\r\nare given for counteracting its deleterious effects. It is said to act\r\nas a hot drastic purgative, and to excoriate the intestines. Its bad\r\neffects are best counteracted by an emetic, butter, gum lac, and other\r\ndemulcents. We used to think there could be little or no doubt but that\r\nSprengel was right in referring it to the strychnos colubrinus; but of\r\nlate, certain authorities, for whom we feel much respect, have held it\r\nto be the _Croton Tiglium_. See Royle (Antiq. Hind. Med. 36; Mat. Med.\r\n552); Pereira (739); and Sontheimer apud Ebn Baithar. We still think\r\nthat the _lignum colubrinum_ is at least as applicable to the dende. It\r\nhas been used medicinally in modern times. See Hill (Mat. Med. 693);\r\nGray (Pharmacop. 58); and Pereira (922.) Pereira mentions that he had\r\nanalysed it, and found that it contains nearly the same ingredients as\r\nSt. Ignatius’ Bean. Dr. Lindley calls the tree, which furnishes the\r\nlignum colubrinum, the _Strychnos ligustrina_, and mentions of it that it\r\nhad been used in paralysis of the extremities, and as an anthelminthic.\r\n(Veg. Kingd. 603.) Dr. Royle mentions (M. M. l. c.) that when in India\r\nthe seeds of the croton tiglium were given him as the _dund_ of the\r\nArabians. Is it not more probable that they were merely meant as the\r\n_succedaneum_ of the _dende_?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fel._\r\n\r\nSerapion treats of this substance under the same head with two others,\r\n_bel_ and _sel_. The _bel_ has never been well ascertained, but Sprengel\r\nand Ainslie are agreed that the _sel_ is the _Ægle marmelos_, on which\r\nsee Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 458.) And now with regard to the _Fel_, Serapion\r\ndescribes it as a fruit having an external covering like a filbert,\r\ncontaining a grain like that of the larger pine, its colour being\r\nintermediate between yellow and white, and it, he adds, is the part which\r\nis administered. He says it relieves the inflation of hemorrhoids. (c.\r\n261.) Avicenna gives exactly the same account of _Fael_, which in the\r\nglossarium is described as being “radix seu fructus nenufaris Indi.”\r\nHe calls it a well-known Indian medicine, useful in relaxation of the\r\nnerves, and in inflation of hemorrhoids. He says his virtues are like\r\nthose of the apples of mandragora. (ii, 2, 251.) Rhases, in like manner,\r\nsays briefly of _Fel_ that it is a well-known Indian medicine, having\r\npowers like those of mandragora. (Contin. l. ult. i, 298.) Dr. Ainslie\r\nwrites of it thus: “The croton nuts were known to the Arabian physicians\r\nby the name of _fell_ (Serapion 261), and were formerly brought to\r\nEngland under the name of _Molucca grains_.” (Mat. Ind. 106.) Sprengel\r\nalso in his R. H. H. refers the _Fel_ to the _Croton Tiglium_. Dr. Hill\r\nsays of the Molucca grains: “The grana tiglia are of the ricinus kind;\r\nthey are the _nucula cathartica quarta Moluccana purgatoria_,” &c. See\r\nfurther p. 540, and Geoffroy (iii. 5, 30.) Certainly it appears to us\r\nthat the medicinal virtues of the _Fel_, as given above by Serapion,\r\nRhases, and Avicenna, do not agree well with the known powers of the\r\ncroton tiglium. We cannot, however, pretend to determine what substance\r\nthe Fel was.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Santalum rubrum._\r\n\r\nAvicenna describes the two kinds of sandal wood (_lignum pterocarpi\r\nsantalini_) still well known in practice. He says it is a cold and dry\r\nmedicine, which repels determinations to parts, and this more especially\r\nthe red. The diseases he most particularly recommends it in are,\r\npalpitation of the heart, fevers, weakness of the stomach, and this\r\nboth in liniments and in draughts. The white, he says, is useful in hot\r\nfevers. (ii, 2, 649.) He quotes Galen under this head, but his translator\r\nis sensible of this being a mistake. Serapion describes the white, the\r\nyellow, and the red kinds of sandal-wood, and gives a very circumstantial\r\naccount of them. He says sandal-wood is brought from Sini (China?). The\r\nvarious authorities quoted by him concur in giving the different kinds\r\nof sandal-wood the same characters as Avicenna, representing it as being\r\nuseful in complaints of the stomach, and in cardiac disease; and mixed\r\nwith camphor and rose oil as an external application in hot vertigo when\r\nrubbed into the temples. They also agree in representing it along with\r\nother cooling plants as being serviceable in gout. The sandal-woods,\r\nin short, they all hold to be cold in the third degree and dry in the\r\nsecond. (De Simpl. 346.) Rhases gives a brief account of the red and\r\nwhite sandal-woods, which his authorities recommend in weakness of the\r\nstomach, and pain of the head; and also for palpitation of the heart in\r\nfevers, when rubbed over the stomach, and for erysipelas when rubbed into\r\nthe face. (Contin. l. ult. ii, 1, 609.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Azedarach._\r\n\r\nAvicenna describes it as being a well-known tree, having fruit like the\r\nLotus Arbor (_Celtis Australis?_). He says it is a very large tree,\r\nand that its flower is hot in the third degree, and dry in the end of\r\nthe first, and that it is possessed of deobstruent powers; and the\r\ndecoction of its leaves kills lice in the hair and strengthens it. Its\r\nfruit is bad for the stomach and chest. It is anthelminthic, and useful\r\nin colics and in pituitous fevers along with fumitory and myrobalans.\r\n(ii, 2, 17.) Rhases gives the same account of the _assedarach_. (Contin.\r\nl. ult. i, 89.) It is barely mentioned by Serapion as being a large\r\ntree, but we have not been able to discover it in his Mat. Med. The\r\nArabian authorities of Ebn Baithar give an elaborate account of it,\r\nrepresenting it as being dangerous to persons who take it in large doses,\r\nbut in smaller ones useful for various purposes, and more especially\r\nfor promoting the growth of the hair. (i, 30.) There can be no question\r\nthat it must have been the _Melia azedarach_ or “bead tree.” Dr. Ainslie\r\nsays of it that “in India the bark of the melia azedarach has been\r\nascertained to possess powerful tonic and antifebrile virtues,” and that\r\n“it is ordered for almost every purpose that the cinchona is in Europe.”\r\n(Mat. Ind. i, 70, ii, 454.) See further on the tree, Miller (Dictionary);\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 464); and Crantz (Mat. Med. iii, 40.) The last of\r\nthese says of it, that he had “read in the _Encyclopedia_ (!!) that it\r\nkills lice, &c.” The azedarach is frequently noticed in the Susruta. See\r\nalso Wise’s Book of Hindu Medicine. (119.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anacardium._\r\n\r\nOn this see Serapion (De Simpl. 356); Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i, 47);\r\nand Avicenna (ii, 2, 40.) Of these authorities Avicenna describes it\r\nmost minutely. They all recommend it in mental diseases, and especially\r\nin loss of memory, and say it is useful in coldness of the nerves,\r\nin paralysis, and spasms. Avicenna recommends it as a fumigation to\r\nhemorrhoids. Without doubt it is the _Semicarpus Anacardium_, or “marking\r\nnut tree” of commerce. It has been used in modern practice, but has now\r\nfallen into disuse. See Hill (Mat. Med. 490.) Rhases quotes Galen on the\r\n_anacardium_, referring, as we suppose, to his χρυσοβάλανος. (De Comp.\r\nMed. sec. gen. viii.) That the latter was the _semicarpus anacardium_\r\nseems not unlikely. See Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 209.) It is briefly\r\nnoticed also by Myrepsus and Actuarius under the name of ξανθοβάλανος.\r\nAnd further, it is deserving of remark that _anacardia_ occurs as an\r\ningredient in one of our author’s antidotes (c. 170, Ed. Basil.) To\r\nsay the least then, it appears doubtful whether the Greeks were wholly\r\nignorant of these substances as stated by Matthiolus. (Comment. in\r\nDioscor. 189.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diudar._\r\n\r\nAvicenna says of it that it belongs to the genus _abhel_ (sabina?) and is\r\ncalled the Indian pine; that it is pungent, and contains a milk which is\r\nhot and occasions thirst. He adds that it is good for relaxation of the\r\nnerves, paralysis, &c., also for cold apostemes (chronic inflammations?)\r\nof the brain, apoplexy, and catalepsy. He concludes by stating of it that\r\nit is lithontriptic, binds the bowels, and that its decoction removes\r\nrelaxation of the anus. (ii, 2, 213.) In the Glossarium of Avicenna (l.\r\nc.) reference is here made to Rhases (Cont. l. ult. iii, 31), but we\r\ncan find no notice of the Diudar there, nor in any part of the works of\r\nRhases. Ebn Baithar’s account of this article is taken literally from\r\nAvicenna. Dr. Royle has ingeniously pointed out the correspondence both\r\nof name and characters between the _Diudar_ of the Arabians and the\r\n_Pinus Deodara_. (Antiquity of Hindoo Med. 36.) See also Lindley (Veget.\r\nKingd. 228.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sandaracha_, or _Gum vernix_.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, on the outset, that Serapion and Avicenna in\r\ntreating of the vernix do not make any reference to Dioscorides and\r\nGalen, as is their wont, from which it may be inferred that they did\r\nnot recognise it as one of the articles which had been described by\r\ntheir Grecian masters. Serapion’s Arabian authorities on this head\r\nare, Albugerig, Aben Mesuai, Badegoras, Mesarugie, Abrix, Alabari,\r\nRhases, and Isaac Eben. They agree in recommending it in fumigations\r\nfor catarrhs, for stopping immoderate menstruation, drying fistulæ; as\r\nan anthelminthic, and remedy for hemoptysis and hemorrhoids. One of\r\nhis authorities (Isaac Eben) describes it as being a gum of a yellow\r\ncolour, like the _karabe_, and says it is brought from the land of the\r\nChristians. He adds, respecting the _karabe_, that Galen says it is\r\nthe gum _haur romane_ (populi Romanæ [?]). Whether by this he meant\r\namber, we shall inquire presently. Avicenna says of the _sandaracha_ or\r\n_vernix_, that it is hot and dry in the second degree, and that it has\r\nsome astringency, and the power of stopping hemorrhages. He says it is\r\nused for removing obesity, for drying fistulæ, that the smoke of it cures\r\ncatarrhs, and is the best of all remedies for toothache; that it cures\r\npalpitation as well as the _karabe_, stops fluxes of blood, cures humid\r\nasthma, and is used by wrestlers to strengthen the breath. It is good, he\r\nconcludes by saying of it, in diseases of the spleen, and its fumes cure\r\nold sores and hemorrhoids. (ii, 2, 619.) It may be proper to remark here,\r\nthat although Avicenna applies the term _sandarach_ both to _realgar_\r\nand _gum vernix_ he does not fall into the mistake of confounding these\r\nsubstances with one another. This will be clearly seen by comparing ii,\r\n2, 48, with l. c. The Latin translation of the chapter in Rhases’s\r\n‘Continens,’ on Sandarach, is so particularly barbarous, that some\r\npassages of it are scarcely intelligible to _us_, albeit we have spent\r\nmore time than most people in poring over these most _unclassical_\r\nproductions. It is clear, however, that his Arabian authorities recommend\r\nvernix in exactly the same cases as Serapion and Avicenna do, namely, in\r\nfumigations for asthma and coryza, as a drying application to fistulæ and\r\nhemorrhoids, as a stimulant in diseases of the eyes, and as a remedy for\r\ndefluxion and fluxes of blood from the womb. (Contin. l. ult. i, 610.)\r\n\r\nDr. Lewis, treating of the Juniperus, says, “In the warmer climates,\r\nparticularly on the coasts of Africa, there exudes from a larger species\r\nof juniper a resinous juice which concretes into semi-pellucid, pale,\r\nyellowish tears, resembling mastich, but larger; the _sandaracha_ and\r\n_gummi juniperi_ of the shops, called by some, from the use to which it\r\nis principally applied, _vernix_. It has been given internally against\r\nhemorrhages, old fluxes, and ulcerations; but is principally employed\r\nexternally in corroborant, nervine, and traumatic applications.” (Mat.\r\nMed. ii, 24.) Recent authorities have decided that the gum sandarach is\r\nnot the product of the juniperus communis, as usually supposed, but of\r\nthe _Callitris quadrivalris_. See Pereira (Mat. Med. 727); and Lindley\r\n(Veg. Kingd. 229.) On the vernix see further Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop.\r\n201.)\r\n\r\nIs this the same as the _Cedria_ of the Greeks and Romans? See\r\nDioscorides (i, 105); Galen (De Simpl. vi.) We are inclined to think that\r\nit either was the same, or, at all events, that both were procured from\r\ntrees of the same genus. See the description of the Cedria given by Pliny\r\n(H. N. xxiv, 11) with the notes of Harduin. We have stated under _Cedrus_\r\nthat it generally signifies a large species of juniper. And further,\r\nupon comparing the medicinal uses of the _cedria_ as given by Pliny (who\r\nfollows Dioscorides closely) with those of the Sandarach as given above\r\nfrom the Arabians, no one can doubt that they must apply to the same\r\nthing, or at least to substances of a like kind. The _cedria_ must not be\r\nconfounded with _cedrium_ described by Pliny. (H. N. xvi, 21.) The latter\r\nwould appear to have been a liquid procured from the wood by distillation\r\nor boiling. There appears much probability in the conjecture of Berzelius\r\nthat the _cedrium_ was a sort of pyroligneous acid. Pliny says it was\r\nused for embalming dead bodies. (l. c.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Karabe_, or _Populus_.\r\n\r\nAvicenna describes it as being the gum of a tree called _haur romana_\r\n(populus Romana?), resembling vernix, of different colours, and when\r\nof a ruddy colour attracting chaff and other small objects. He says\r\nthe gum is like the flower of the tree in virtues but colder, being\r\nastringent in the case of all fluxes, especially bleeding from the\r\nnose, and hemoptysis. He agrees with Rhases and Serapion that it is\r\na good periapt in cases of hot apostemes. He recommends it as a good\r\ncordial medicine, and one which is useful in affections of the stomach\r\nand bowels. (ii, 2, 364.) He treats of the other parts of the poplar\r\nseparately, and also gives a distinct chapter on _Ambra_, and in his work\r\n‘De Med. Cord.’ he treats separately of _Ambra_ and _Karabe_. Serapion\r\nunder the head of _haur romi_ first gives abbreviated translations of\r\nDioscorides’s and Galen’s descriptions of the black poplar (ἄιγειρος),\r\nand then a translation of an extract said to be from Paulus, but which\r\nwe cannot trace in the works of our author. In that extract _Karabe_\r\nis called the gum of the _haur romi_; it is said to be astringent, and\r\nto be confounded by some with the sandarach, and that it was called\r\nthe funeral gum because the Latins used it in burials. He concludes by\r\ngiving extracts from several Arabian authorities regarding its medicinal\r\ncharacters, which agree in the main with those given above from Avicenna.\r\n(De Simpl. 276.) He gives a perfectly distinct chapter on _Ambra_ (c.\r\n196.) Rhases has a chapter on the “_haur seu fagus_,” which, except that\r\nit does not contain the pretended extract from Paulus, is made up from\r\nalmost the same authorities as the one of Serapion which we have just\r\ndiscussed. _Karabe_, it is said, is the gum of the tree. (Contin. l. ult.\r\ni, 256.) Although there is a good deal of confusion in the accounts of\r\n_Karabe_ contained in these extracts, we think it impossible to avoid\r\ndrawing the conclusion that the authorities meant to apply it to the\r\nresin of some _balsam poplar_, probably some variety of the _Populus\r\nnigra_, or _dilatata_. It would be a great mistake then to identify the\r\n_Karabe_ with amber. Indeed, Ebn Baithar distinctly says that amber\r\nis _not_ the gum of the black poplar as had been supposed, which he\r\nclearly establishes by showing that the characters of the gum poplar,\r\nas given by Dioscorides and Galen, by no means accord with those of\r\namber (succinum.) See further under _Electrum_, _Sandarach_, and _Ambra\r\ngrisea_. It is proper to mention that although our opinion with regard to\r\nthe _Karabe_ be as we have stated, most of our modern authorities have\r\nset it down as being identical with the _succinum_. See Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 215); Royle (Mat. Med. 648); Pemberton (Dispensatory, 102.)\r\nWe are persuaded, however, that whoever will carefully read the ninth\r\nchapter of the first part of Avicenna’s work “on Cordial Medicines,”\r\nmust agree with us that he held the _Karabe_ and _Ambra_ to be totally\r\ndifferent substances, and a careful study of Mesue (De Electariis)\r\nwill confirm this conclusion. The gum or resin of the black poplar is\r\nmentioned by Schroeder. (Chemical Dispensat. 442.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tembul_ and _Faufel_.\r\n\r\nWe treat of these substances under one head for a reason which will\r\nbecome apparent before the conclusion of our article upon them. _Tembul_,\r\naccording to Avicenna, is cold in the first degree and dry in the second;\r\nit is astringent and desiccant; it strengthens the gums, and for this\r\npurpose is constantly chewed by the Indians; it also strengthens the\r\nstomach, and for this purpose also is frequently chewed by the same\r\npeople. (ii, 2, 699.) Haly Abbas gives a very similar account of it;\r\nhe says it is brought from India, and that seafaring men made much use\r\nof it, because they lived much upon fish. (Pract. ii, 36, 207.) Ebn\r\nBaithar treats of it at great length. One of his authorities, Abuthanifa,\r\nsays it improves the state of the mouth. Elmasudi gives an interesting\r\ndescription of it; he says it renders the breath fragrant, improves the\r\nmouth, and even the mind, and he says further of it that it reddens the\r\nteeth. Elgafaki says it cures bleeding and swelling of the tonsils, being\r\nof an astringent and desiccant nature. Elscherif calls it hot in the\r\nfirst, and dry in the second degree, and says it produces exhilaration\r\nof spirits, and cures flatulence. He describes minutely the Indian mode\r\nof using it. The author himself under this head warns his readers not to\r\nconfound the plant used in his time for the tembul, with the true tembul,\r\nwhich he says was seldom brought from India in his days because it lost\r\nits virtues by being carried to a distance. (ii, 200.)\r\n\r\n_Faufel_, or _Avellana Indica_, is described by Serapion’s authorities\r\nas being like the nutmeg, and as having a slight degree of heat with\r\nsome bitterness. Its virtues are said to be like those of the sandal\r\ntree. It is recommended as an application to hot apostemes. Some of\r\nhis authorities call it hot and dry, and all seem to agree in holding\r\nit to be astringent. One of them, Mesarugie, says that it suits with\r\ntoothache and scabies of the eyebrow. Mesue says it strengthens the\r\nteeth, represses the gums when swelled, and is useful in swelling of\r\nthe eye. (De Simpl. 345.) Avicenna describes it as being cold with some\r\nastringency, and as being useful in hot apostemes of a gross nature, and\r\ninflation of the eye. (i, 2, 256.) Ebn Baithar calls it a palm, and says\r\nof it that it is a gentle purgative, makes the breath fragrant, is a\r\ncordial, and strengthens the gums and teeth. (i, 267.)\r\n\r\nNow there can be no doubt that the former of these is the _piper betel_,\r\nand the latter the _areca catechu_. The nuts of the latter, which modern\r\nauthorities describe as resembling the nutmeg, are cut into slices, and\r\nalong with the leaves of the betel constitute the famous masticatory\r\nof the East called _betel_. For an account of these two substances,\r\nconsult in particular Ainslie (Mat. Ind. i, 268, 465); Royle (Antiq. of\r\nHindoo Med. 85); Pereira (M. M. 616); Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 137); Meyen\r\n(Geograph. of Botany, as edited by the Ray Society.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chubabe_, or _Cubebæ_.\r\n\r\nAvicenna under this head refers to the _carpesium_ of Galen, but it\r\nevidently was a different substance. Some, he says, had called it\r\nrefrigerant with some heat, but he holds it to be truly hot and dry in\r\nthe second degree. He calls it aperient and attenuant, and recommends\r\nit in putrid ulcers of the members and gums, as a medicine which clears\r\nthe voice when held in the mouth, and as a deobstruent of the liver\r\nin _engorgement_ thereof; as a cleanser of the urinary passages, as a\r\ndiuretic medicine which promotes the discharge of gravel and stones of\r\nthe kidneys, and of the bladder, and he adds, “Sputum masticantis eam\r\ndelectat eam cum qua habetur coitus.” (ii, 2, 134.) Rhases also, through\r\nsome mistake, quotes Galen under this head, and gives exactly the same\r\naccount of its medicinal powers as Avicenna. (Contin. l. ult. i, 242.)\r\nSerapion under this head gives Dioscorides’s description of the wild\r\nmyrtle with further references to Galen and Paulus, but concludes by\r\nsaying that he was sensible Dioscorides had not treated of cubebs. (De\r\nSimpl. 288.) Ebn Baithar mentions that certain of the authorities had\r\ntaken it for the _carpesium_. He says it renders the breath fragrant and\r\ncures affections of the bladder. He further quotes Ebn Sina (Avicenna?)\r\nas stating that it enhances the delight of coitus. (i, 344.) By the way,\r\nDr. Pereira mentions that the Indians still take them to excite the\r\nsexual feelings. We would beg to refer for further information on this\r\nsubject to his excellent account of the _Piper Cubeba_. (754.) See also\r\nLindley (Veg. Kingd. 204), and Royle (M. M. 562.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Usnen._\r\n\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 713); Serapion (De Simpl. 257); Rhases (Contin. l.\r\nult. i, 753.) This term is used rather vaguely by the Arabian authors,\r\nbut there can be no doubt that it comprehended the _salsola fruticosa_.\r\nThey call it abstergent, cleansing, and aperient, and recommend it as an\r\nemmenagogue, and in difficulty of urine and dropsy. Rhases says it is\r\nof a hot and dry nature, and is purgative, deobstruent, and corrosive.\r\n(Ad Mansor. iii, 22.) The _confectio de usnen_ of Serapion containing\r\nfourteen other ingredients mostly of an aromatic nature, is recommended\r\nby him for debility of the stomach. (De Antidot. 71.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fagara_, or _Fagre_.\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. c. c.); Avicenna (ii, 2, 260); Rhases (Cont. l.\r\nult. i, 312.) Serapion’s authorities compare it to the vetch, and say of\r\nit that it is hot and dry in the second degree, and is stomachic. Isaac\r\nebn Amran describes it as having a small, black, round grain within,\r\nand a red one without, as forming a good gargle in fætor of the mouth,\r\nand entering as an ingredient into powders and ointments. Avicenna’s\r\ndescription of it is to the same effect; he says, however, that it is\r\nhot and dry in the third degree. He recommends it as an astringent,\r\nstomachic, and hepatic medicine. Rhases’s account of it is very short,\r\nbut not far different from the others. Dr. Lindley describing the\r\n_Xanthoxylon hastile_, says of it, “that its capsules and seeds are\r\nemployed in Northern India for intoxicating fish; they are also given as\r\nthe faghuret of Avicenna. The X. piperitum and Avicennæ are used in China\r\nand Japan as antidotes against all poisons; they would undoubtedly in\r\nmany cases be of considerable use as a stimulant remedy.” (Veg. Kingd.\r\n473.) See further Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 270), and Royle (M. M. 326.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artamita._\r\n\r\nAvicenna gives such a description of it as fully justifies Sprengel in\r\ndeciding it to be the _Cyclamen Persicum_. He recommends it in diseases\r\nof the joints, as a sternutatory, and for the cure of hiccup, and says of\r\nit that it is alexipharmic and produces abortion. (ii, 2, 61.) It is in\r\nuse with the Hindoo physicians. See Wise (System of Hindoo Med.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vertz._\r\n\r\nFrom Serapion’s account of it there seems no doubt that it is the\r\n_Memecylon tinctorium_. He gives a very minute description of three\r\nspecies which grow in Arabia and India, and mentions that some held the\r\nroot of one of the species to be the curcuma. They are all remarkable for\r\ncontaining colouring matter. He recommends them for the cure of leprosy,\r\npruritus, and pustula. (De Simpl. 170.) Rhases briefly describes it\r\nby the name of _vars_. He says two kinds, the yellow and the red, are\r\nbrought from Yemen, and that they are collected upon trees like pounded\r\nsaffron. (Contin. l. ult. iii, 110.) Avicenna describes it by the name\r\nof _gures_. (ii, 2, 291.) His description is very similar to that given\r\nby Rhases, and he recommends it in the very same cases as Serapion. Ebn\r\nBaithar gives a very full and interesting description of it both as a dye\r\nand as a medicine, but we need not enter into an exposition of his views,\r\nsince they scarcely differ at all from the account of it given above\r\nfrom Serapion. We may just mention that he says clothes dyed with it are\r\naphrodisiac. See Vol. I, 585. The memecyls constitute a genus of plants\r\nstill well known in India as dyes and articles of food and medicine. See\r\nthe works of Royle and Lindley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mahaleb._\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 44); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 442); Avicenna\r\n(ii, 2, 471.) It appears to be undoubtedly the _Prunus Mahaleb_, that is\r\nto say, the _Cerasus Mahaleb_ of Miller, Angl., “rock,” _or_ “perfumed”\r\ncherry. Serapion applies to it what Dioscorides and Galen had written on\r\nthe _phillyrea_; after which he gives the opinions of several Arabian\r\nauthorities who recommend it as a medicine to expel the superfluities of\r\nthe system and intestinal worms, and as being useful in gout, and as a\r\nlithontriptic. One of them, Isaac ebn Amram, describes the varieties of\r\nit very circumstantially. Avicenna and Rhases give a similar account of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jesemin_ and _Zambach_.\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 176); Rhases (Contin. xxii, 838; l. ult. i, 369);\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 611); and Ebn Baithar (591.)\r\n\r\nSerapion describes them under the same head, the one as having a white\r\nflower, and the other a yellow, of which the latter is the weaker in\r\nits powers. It is got, he says, from Babylonia, where there is another\r\nspecies which has a sky-blue colour. His authorities recommend it\r\nprincipally in phlegmatic complaints, and more particularly in those\r\nof old persons, and as an application in impetigo and other cutaneous\r\ndiseases of a like nature. He says it induces headache when administered\r\nto persons of a hot temperament. Avicenna gives a very similar account\r\nof these two plants, and neither Rhases nor Ebn Baithar supplies any\r\nadditional information regarding them; the latter, however, gives a very\r\ninteresting account of them. He says of the yellow species that it was\r\nused for dyeing the hair. Like the others, he speaks favorably of it,\r\nand especially of its oil in complaints of a cold nature. The latter\r\nspecies, in all probability, was the _jasminum sambac_, still well known\r\nin the East as a perfume. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 651); Gray (Suppl. to\r\nPharmacop. 59); and Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 242.) Whether the other be the\r\n_humile_ or _officinale_, we are unable to determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Secacul._\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 89) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 663.) From the\r\ndescription which they give of it, there can be no doubt, we think, that\r\nit is the _pastinaca secacul_, Russel; that is to say, the Tordilium\r\norientale, _secacul dictum_ of Miller. (Gard. Dictionary.) They agree in\r\nsaying that it is decidedly aphrodisiac, more especially when preserved\r\nwith honey. Avicenna concludes his notice of it with stating that\r\n_buzeiden_ is used instead of it. In another part of his work he gives\r\nvery sensible directions for preparing _secacul conditum_, that is to\r\nsay, “preserved secacul.” (v, 1, 8.) Although, as we have stated above,\r\nwe think there is little or no doubt that the secacul was a species of\r\ntordylium, it is proper to acknowledge that the learned commentators on\r\nMesue are much divided in opinion respecting it. (De Electariis, i, 95.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buzeiden._\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 260); Avicenna (ii, 2, 95); and Ebn Baithar\r\n(ii, 183.) Avicenna describes it as being an Indian medicine possessing\r\nvirtues resembling those of beer. He says it is hot in the second degree,\r\nand dry in the first; is attenuant, proves serviceable in pains of\r\nthe joints and in gout; is aphrodisiacal and alexipharmic. (ii, 295.)\r\nSerapion calls it a species of satyrion (orchis?). He calls it an Indian\r\nmedicine, little used in his country. He says it resembles hermodactyls\r\nin the cure of arthritic diseases or of gout, and that it engenders\r\nsemen, but hurts the testicles. Its bad effects are best corrected by\r\nmustard; its dose two drachms. Ebn Baithar, in this instance, supplies\r\nno additional information. After what we have stated of it, we need have\r\nno hesitation in agreeing with Sprengel that it is the _orchis morio_,\r\nor at all events some species of that genus. As Serapion does not quote\r\nany Greek authorities under this head, it may be inferred that he held\r\nit to be distinct from the _orchis_ of Dioscorides and his followers.\r\nSeveral species of this genus are still used in India as medicines. The\r\nfamous _salep_ is procured principally from the _O. mascula_. See Royle,\r\nLindley, and Pereira.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mial_, or _Storax humida_.\r\n\r\nThe liquid Storax is described distinctly by Avicenna, who states that\r\none species of it exudes from the tree and the other is got by boiling;\r\nthat the former is of a lighter colour and is highly valuable, whereas\r\nthe other is darker and is less esteemed. Some, he says, held it to\r\nbe beneficial in cerebral diseases, but this opinion he rejects, as\r\nit induces vertigo. See under _Storax_. He quotes only from Arabian\r\nauthorities. (ii, 2, 423, 615.) Both kinds of storax are treated of\r\nlargely by Serapion. (De Simpl. 46), and are noticed by Rhases. (Contin.\r\nl. ult. i, 687.)\r\n\r\nIt is still disputed what tree it is which produces the Liquid Storax.\r\nAccording to Sprengel and most modern authorities, until of late, it was\r\nheld to be the _Altingia excelsa_. Dr. Pereira, however, shows that this\r\nis a doubtful point, and mentions that Dr. Lindley holds that the liquid\r\nstorax of the shops is produced by the _liquid ambar orientale_. But in\r\nhis recent publication on the ‘Vegetable Kingdom,’ Dr. Lindley says,\r\n“Liquid storax is thought to be yielded by the Dammar pine.” (p. 229.)\r\nLanderer has recently shown that it is obtained from Storax officinale.\r\n(Pereira, Mat. Med. 1325, 2d ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kadi._\r\n\r\nIt is described by Serapion as being a plant which grows in Arabia, from\r\nwhich the aromatic oil of Kadi is formed. He gives a curious description\r\nof it, but does not mention any medicinal purposes to which it was\r\napplied. (De Simpl. 40.) It would appear that it is also described by Ebn\r\nBaithar (i, 337.) He describes it as being a species of palm, which it\r\nresembles in all respects, and says that a fragrant oil is prepared from\r\nit. Its country is Arabia. He quotes on it Rhases, in his ‘Continens’ and\r\n‘Treatise on Smallpox,’ but we have been unable to discover the passages\r\nwhich he refers to. His authorities describe, in glowing colours, the\r\nvirtues of this substance, and more especially of its wine, in smallpox.\r\nWhat species of palm it was we are unable to say decidedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meizaragi._\r\n\r\nSerapion gives a full account of it upon the authority of Abugerit and\r\nAbir, who agree in recommending it in arthritic diseases. They give\r\nminute directions for using it in electuaries, pills, and decoctions.\r\nIts dose with sugar is one drachm. They mention that, when put into\r\nrivers, it intoxicates fish. (De Simpl. 365.) Avicenna describes the\r\n_Mehezeheregi_, as being a tree like esula (_spurge?_); and says it is\r\nhot and dry in the third degree, and intoxicates fish when thrown into a\r\nriver. He adds, that it is carminative and phlegmagogue, and is useful in\r\ngout, sciatica, and arthritis. (ii, 2, 480.)\r\n\r\nWe need have no hesitation in agreeing with the best authorities, that\r\nit is cocculus indicus, or the seed of _Menispermum cocculus_ L., i. q.,\r\n_Anamirta cocculus_ of Lindley. (See Veg. Kingd. 309.) He says of it,\r\nthat it contains a most venomous principle, the picrotoxine, and that in\r\nits pericarp is found the not less formidable alcaloid menispermine. See\r\nalso Gray (Pharmacop. 119), and Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 132.) Both these\r\nauthors mention of it, that it is used to intoxicate fish. See, further,\r\nan excellent account of the cocculus indicus in Pereira (M. M. 1326.) It\r\nwas used by the Hindoo physicians for the cure of nervous diseases. See\r\nWise (System of Hindoo Med. 557.) Dr. Royle is somewhat doubtful whether\r\nthe cocculus was known to the Arabian physicians, but upon the whole\r\ninclines to this opinion. (Mat. Med. 249.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nux Vomica._\r\n\r\nWe have briefly treated of the _Nux Vomica_ as a poison in another\r\nplace (Vol. II, 241.) We have now to say of it, that it was also used\r\nmedicinally as an emetic. For example, Haly Abbas treats of it in his\r\nchapter on Medicines which procure Vomiting. (Pract. ii, 65; see also\r\nPract. x, 12.) Serapion, in like manner, treats of it in his chapter on\r\nEmetic Medicines. (vii, 36.) Thus he gives the following formula for\r\nan emetic: “℞. Concarned (cardamomi?), nucis vomicæ, seminis raphani,\r\nomnium ān ʒ j. Terantur et dentur in potu cum aqua mellis et decoctione\r\nanethi.” Serapion treats of it also in his work ‘On Simples,’ where he\r\nstates, that “easy vomiting” may be induced by administering it agreeably\r\nto the formula which we have just quoted from his other work. He adds,\r\nthat perhaps it will also loosen the bowels. Abram, another of his\r\nauthorities, likewise says, that given to the amount of two drachms, with\r\ntwo drachms of dill or of fennel seed, and drunk with warm water, it will\r\nproduce vomiting and loosen the bowels. (De. Simpl. 163.) Ebn Baithar’s\r\nauthorities give an interesting account of the _Nux Vomica_, from which\r\nit is clear that it was frequently used as an emetic, along with fennel,\r\nnatron, mustard, &c. in hydromel.\r\n\r\nDr. Pereira, upon the authority of Dale (Pharmacol.), decides that the\r\nStrychnos Ignatia was the nux vomica of Serapion. But, notwithstanding\r\nour great respect for his opinions, we cannot agree with him in the\r\npresent instance. For, considering how common the nux vomica is in Persia\r\n(Ainslie, Mat. Ind.), there is a strong presumption that the Arabians\r\ncannot have been unacquainted with it, and it is not pretended that the\r\nnux vomica is treated of by them by any other name unless it were the\r\n_methel_, which we will presently show it not to be, nor is it attempted\r\nto be shown when and how the misapplication of the term originated.\r\nSee, however, in support of Dr. Pereira’s views, Parkinson (Theatre of\r\nPlants, 1601.) It is also proper to mention, that the learned Geoffroy\r\ncalls the Faba sancti Ignatii the _nux vomica legitima_. But as it is\r\nadmitted by the best authorities on toxicology, that St. Ignatius bean\r\nis much more energetic in its action than nux vomica (see Christison,\r\n644, and Orfila, ii, 276), there is still less probability of its having\r\nbeen used medicinally than the other. See further in support of the\r\nviews we are advocating, Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 250.) We may mention also\r\nin conclusion, that the nux vomica was used as an emetic by the Hindoo\r\nphysicians, more especially in the case of poisoning. See Wise (Hindoo\r\nMed. 402.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nux Methel._\r\n\r\nWe have briefly alluded to this substance (_Datura Methel_) as a poison\r\nelsewhere. (Vol. II, 241.) Serapion, quoting from Arabian authorities,\r\ncompares its nut to the nux vomica, and its seed to that of mandragora:\r\nits bark, he adds, is rough, its taste pleasant and unctuous, and its\r\nvirtues cold in the fourth degree; if given in a small dose (_kirat_ or\r\n_siliqua_?) it intoxicates strongly, and if two drachms are given it\r\nproves fatal at once. Rhases, as quoted by him, says it is a narcotic,\r\na sedative, and perhaps emetic medicine, and that it proves fatal in\r\nlarge doses, and in small intoxicates. He directs its pernicious effects\r\nto be counteracted by taking warm butter, and thus producing vomiting,\r\nand otherwise treating the case in the same manner as in poisoning by\r\nmandragora. (De Simpl. 375.) Rhases, in his work entitled ‘Ad Mansor.,’\r\nsays of the nut methel, that it is a dangerous medicine, which induces\r\nstupor, nausea, vomiting, and inebriety. (iii, 30.) His account of it\r\nin his ‘Continens’ is very brief. Avicenna describes it in his ‘Mat.\r\nMed.’ as being a nut similar to the nux vomica, and having seed like the\r\ncitron (?). Like the others, he says it inebriates, induces stupor, and\r\nis inimical to the brain and heart. In the dose of a drachm he says it\r\nproves fatal. (ii, 2, 501.) Ebn Baithar’s authorities give a full account\r\nof it, but differing little from the others already given. One of them\r\nsays, that a drachm will kill on the spot, and in small doses it induces\r\nstupor, vomiting, and loss of sense. They direct these bad effects to\r\nbe counteracted by the administration of an emetic of natron (soda), by\r\ngiving wine and pepper, and keeping up the heat of the body. The Hindoo\r\nphysicians held that it is alexiterial. See Susruta and Wise (Hindoo Med.)\r\n\r\nAn excellent modern authority says of the _Datura Metel_, that “its\r\nseeds are narcotic, more powerful than the _Datura Stramomium_, and\r\nproduce temporary idiotcy.” Gray (Suppl. to Pharm. 52.) Dr. Lindley,\r\nafter describing the _Datura Stramonium_ as a violent narcotic, says of\r\nthe _Metel_, that it has a similar action. (Veg. Kingd. 619.) Comparing,\r\nthen, the effects of the _Nux Methel_, as described by the ancient\r\nauthorities with those of the _Datura Methel_, as given by those recent\r\nauthorities, we cannot hesitate in recognising their identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rachaba_, or _Nux Mechil_.\r\n\r\nOne of Serapion’s authorities states that an Arab had told him that it\r\nis a great tree, like the nut-tree, having leaves like a great fig, and\r\nfruit like small pomegranates, and speaks very indistinctly about its\r\nbeing Pharoah’s nut; but it is difficult, from his language, to make\r\nout what he says on that point. He says it is sweet, has a pleasant\r\nsmell, and is eaten by shepherds and others. He mentions that some had\r\nconfounded it with the nux vomica; but he concludes by saying that\r\nwhoever will compare the descriptions of the rachaba and nux vomica must\r\nsee the difference. (De Simpl. 164.) From this description it is quite\r\nclear that this cannot be the nux vomica, but rather one of the eatable\r\nfigs, probably the _ficus benjamina_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nux Henden_, or _Banden_.\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 79) and Avicenna (ii, 2, 496.) According to the\r\nlatter it is a grainy mass, like the vetch, white, inclining to yellow,\r\nwhich is brought from Barea and Chorasan, and of which a wine is made\r\nwith honey. He quotes Paulus (by some mistake we suppose) as saying of\r\nit that it is refrigerant, extinguishes inflammation, and is slightly\r\ndesiccant. It suppresses fluxes of blood, fattens, cures impetigo, and\r\nis aphrodisiac. Serapion’s authorities give a more lengthy description\r\nof it, but do not supply many more particulars. Rhases, one of them,\r\ncalls it the fat of the earth, and the rock of the earth, and another\r\ncalls it pigeon’s root. They all agree that it makes an excellent wine,\r\nwhich forms semen, fattens the body, and is aphrodisiac. They also state\r\nthat it stops fluxes, and causes vomiting. Ebn Baithar’s account of it\r\nis nearly the same as Serapion’s. He says it is called honey earth in\r\nAndalusia. (i, 274.) Sprengel suggests—how correctly we leave it to our\r\nreaders who are better acquainted with the productions of the East than\r\nwe can pretend to be, to determine—that it is the _Garcinia Mangostena_,\r\nor Mangosteen, a fruit which has the reputation of being the finest in\r\nthe world. The description of it, given by Serapion, as far as we can\r\njudge of it from the barbarous Latin translation, would certainly seem\r\nto agree in some striking points with that of the mangosteen. Compare it\r\nwith ‘Loudon, Encycl. of Gardening,’ 1531.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meisce_, or _Mes_.\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. c. 116); Avicenna (ii, 2, 481); Ebn Baithar (ii,\r\n465.) It is described at some length, and in nearly the same terms by\r\nall these authors. They call it a small grain like a vetch, of a green\r\ncolour, and say that some used it for fasils, and that it was wholesome\r\nbut not very nutritious. They say of it that it is cold, and rather\r\ndesiccant, useful in catarrhs and coughs, and as a plaster to bruised\r\nand torn parts. In our edition of Serapion it is marked as _mango_ in a\r\nvery old looking hand-writing, and it is recognised as the _Phaseolus\r\nmango_ by Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 266), and by the German translator of Ebn\r\nBaithar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horon_, or _Bombax_.\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 66) and Ebn Baithar (i, 305.) Abuhanifa, one\r\nof Serapion’s authorities, says that some medical men had informed him\r\nthat cotton grows on trees like quinces. So at least we understand the\r\npassage; but as it is very curious, and also very obscure, it may be well\r\nto give the Latin translation: “Dixerunt mihi quidam medici de kelbe\r\nquod _coton_ nascitur inter eos in arboribus quæ sunt sicut arbores\r\nantipsicorum.” Compare Pliny (H. N. xii, 10.) The next of Serapion’s\r\nauthorities, Aben Mesuai, recommends the juice of it in the diarrhœa of\r\nchildren. Mescha says its seed is beneficial in coughs and good for the\r\nbreast. Albasari says of it that it is good for clothes, and that its\r\njuice is an excellent application in cutaneous diseases of the face.\r\nRhases also, as quoted by him, recommends it in the same cases, and\r\nfurther says of it that it is aphrodisiac. Ebn Baithar’s authorities\r\nalso give an interesting account of it, recommending it in much the\r\nsame cases as those of Serapion, namely in infantile diarrhœa, and as\r\nan application to cutaneous diseases; and he further states that it was\r\nused to burn warts, no doubt like the raw flax, often mentioned in the\r\nworks of Hippocrates. The leaves are said to have been useful in uterine\r\ncomplaints, and in gout mixed with rose-oil. Clothes prepared from it\r\nare much praised by the author. There can be no doubt from what we have\r\nstated, that it must have been the _Gossypium arboreum_ or _herbaceum_,\r\nmost probably the latter. See Meyen (Geogr. Botany.) From Ainslie’s Mat.\r\nInd. it will be seen that oil prepared from the former is still used for\r\ncleaning the skin of spots, and that the leaves are given for the cure of\r\ndiarrhœa. (ii, 284.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Musa._\r\n\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 84); Avicenna (ii, 2, 484); Ebn Baithar (ii,\r\n535.) According to Serapion’s first authority, Aben Mesuai, it is hot\r\nin the middle of the first degree, and moistening in the end of it,\r\nlittle nutritious, and has the property of being useful in heat of the\r\nbreast, lungs, and bladder, and softens the bowels; if much used, it\r\ncreates a load on the stomach, and obstruction in the liver, and if taken\r\nby a person of a cold temperament in great quantity, he ought to take\r\nhydromel, oxymel, or prepared ginger with it. Another of his authorities,\r\nSindaxar, says it promotes the growth of the fœtus in utero. A third,\r\nnamed Alchalebemen, says it is a good medicine for the chest and the\r\nkidneys, and is diuretic. The book on ancient medicine, as quoted by\r\nhim, says of it that it is aphrodisiac, and heavy on the stomach; and\r\nAvicenna’s account of it is so similar that it would not be worth while\r\nto give an exposition of it. Ebn Baithar describes it minutely as being a\r\nspecies of Palm. Its medicinal characters, as stated by him, are nearly\r\nthe same as those given above from Serapion. There can be no doubt that\r\nit is the _Musa paradisiaca_, or common plantain tree. On it the reader\r\nmay find it interesting to consult Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 316), and Loudon\r\n(Encycl. of Garden. 1530.) The plantain tree is briefly noticed by\r\nTheophrastus (H. P. iv, 5), but does not occur in the works of the Greek\r\nand Latin physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Granum Kelkel_, or _Alkelkel_.\r\n\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 302); Serapion (De Simpl. 275); Rhases (Contin.\r\nl. ult. i, 378); Ebn Baithar (ii, 315.) Serapion’s authorities say of\r\nit that it is hot and moistening, increases the secretion of semen,\r\nespecially when taken with the oil of sesame; that when taken in too\r\nlarge a dose, it induces cholera, and after other food occasions vertigo.\r\nThe account of it given by Rhases and Avicenna is little different. The\r\nlatter says of it that it is fattening, and comforts relaxed bodies. Ebn\r\nBaithar gives a very minute description of it; he says he planted it in\r\nhis own country, and that it produced fruit. He ascribes the same good\r\nand bad effects to it as Serapion. When roasted, he says, it does not\r\nengender bad chyme. Its seeds are said to be aphrodisiac. We suppose\r\nthere is little or no doubt that it is the _Cassia tora_. On the modern\r\nuse of it by the Hindoos, see Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 405.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lehibach_, or _Lahiba_.\r\n\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 425); Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 389.) Rhases quotes\r\nGalen as saying of it that it has powers like horehound. We are at a\r\nloss to say what substance he alludes to among the Simples of Galen.\r\nAnother authority quoted by him seems to say that a portion of it flung\r\ninto a lake containing fish, will make them swim on the surface, and\r\nAvicenna confirms this statement. Avicenna further says it is emetic\r\nand hydragogue. We would refer it with Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 249) to the\r\n_Mussaenda frondosa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gilbenee._\r\n\r\nAvicenna compares its seed to turbith, and its operation to hellebore.\r\nHe says when given to the amount of half a drachm it operates as an\r\nemetic, and that one drachm may prove fatal. He mentions the case of a\r\nparalytic person who took it, and having vomited was thereby cured. He\r\nadds of it that it also acts as a purgative (ii, 2, 282.) It is evidently\r\nthe _gilbeuce_ of Rhases, who in like manner describes it as a powerful\r\nemetic, the operation of which resembles hellebore, and is useful to\r\nparalytics. More than a drachm of it, he says, given in a dose, may\r\noccasion death. (Ad Mansor. iii, 30.) It appears decidedly to be the\r\n_Cerbera manghas_ L., i. e. _Arbor lactaria_, Rumphius. See Sprengel (R.\r\nH. H. i, 252); Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii, 261.) Dr. Lindley says of it: “The\r\nkernels of _Cerbera manghas_ are emetic and poisonous; the milky sap\r\nis purgative; the leaves and bark are used in Java as a substitute for\r\nsenna.” (Veg. Kingd. 600.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kustberkush._\r\n\r\nAvicenna gives a description of it which appears to us very\r\nunsatisfactory, but which determines Sprengel to refer it to the _Tamarix\r\norientalis_. He calls it hot and dry in the second degree, and attenuant.\r\n(ii, 2, 371.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nefrin_, or _Nerfin_.\r\n\r\nSee Avicenna (ii, 2, 506); Serapion (De Simpl. 187.) Avicenna compares\r\nit to the narcissus, and says it resembles the jasmine in virtue, but is\r\nweaker than it. He recommends it in coldness of the nerves, and as a cure\r\nin noises and pains of the ears, and in toothache. He also recommends\r\nit externally in headache, inflammations of the throat and tonsils, and\r\nfor stopping vomiting and hiccup. Serapion compares it to the rose and\r\njasmine, and recommends it in pleurisy and pains of the womb. Rhases, as\r\nquoted by him, says that in Chorasan he had seen it given to the extent\r\nof two drachms as a purgative. It seems highly probable that it is the\r\n_Narcissus orientalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Muluchia._\r\n\r\nAvicenna (ii, 2, 194); Serapion (De Simpl. 149); Ebn Baithar (ii, 537.)\r\nAvicenna’s description of this article, which he also calls “Olus\r\nJudaicum,” would seem to decide that it is the _Corchorus olitorius_ or\r\nJews’ mallow. The other two authorities quoted above are not so precise\r\nin their description of it. It is more properly an article of food than\r\nof medicine. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 372), and Ainslie (Mat. Ind. ii,\r\n387.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moschus._\r\n\r\nMusk, the inspissated secretion of the follicle in the prepuce of the\r\n_Moschus moschiferus_ L., would appear to be first mentioned in the\r\nworks of Aëtius (xvi, 122), who gives formulæ for various fumigations\r\n(suffumigia) containing a great many aromatics, and among them musk. But\r\nas we have already had occasion to state, we entertain strong suspicions\r\nthat the concluding chapters of this author may be spurious. Indeed, as\r\nthis important article is not noticed by authors subsequent to Aëtius,\r\nsuch as Oribasius, it would appear to us that this circumstance is the\r\nstrongest possible presumption, that the passage in Aëtius had been\r\nadded after the Arabian period of medicine. There is one notice of it\r\nalso by our author, but it also has a suspicious appearance. (p. 292,\r\ned. Basil. See also 296.) Serapion gives a long account of it, first\r\nupon the authority of Abuhanifa, who calls the animal the musk gazelle,\r\nand says its habitat is in the countries of _Tumbasci_ and _Sini_, by\r\nwhich he probably means Thibet and China. Of these the better kind, he\r\nsays, is that procured from Thibet, as the animal in that country lives\r\non fragrant herbs, and the inhabitants are better acquainted with the\r\nprocess of extracting it from its follicles. And, moreover, he says, the\r\nSinenses (Chinese?) are apt to adulterate their musk. The animal which\r\nproduces musk, he adds, does not differ in figure, colour, nor horns from\r\nother gazelles, and the best musk is procured after it is full grown.\r\nHe then gives an anatomical description of its canine teeth, and of the\r\nmodes of catching it by snares, gins, and by shooting it with arrows; and\r\nalso the manner of extracting the musk from the animal after its death.\r\nBut the best musk, he says, is procured from the animal when it is in a\r\nstate of orgasm, and rubs its follicles against a rock until the musk\r\ndrops out of them. The inhabitants of Thibet (homines de Thebeth) know\r\nthe places where the animal feeds, and collect the musk thus procured\r\nfrom them. This, he remarks, is the finest musk of all, and is reserved\r\nfor royal personages and held in high esteem. This authority concludes by\r\nsaying that in the region of _Thebeth_ there are many cities, but that\r\nthe one, from which musk is procured, is that city which is properly\r\ncalled _Thebeth_. His next authority is Alcholabama, who calls musk hot\r\nin the second degree, and dry in the third. The following one, Aben\r\nMesuai, says of it, that it comforts the heart and internal viscera, both\r\nwhen drunk and when applied externally in plasters. His next authority is\r\nHonain, who recommends musk in diseases of the eyes. The others supply\r\nlittle additional information on it, but in general recommend it in\r\ndiseases of the brain. He says the Persian doctors applied the oil to\r\nthe member as an aphrodisiac. (De Simpl. 185.) Rhases recommends musk in\r\nheadache, and all cold affections of the head, and also as a stomachic.\r\n(Ad Mansor. iii, 22.) In his ‘Continens’ he quotes from several Arabian\r\nauthorities, all of whom give it the characters already stated, and\r\nrecommend it most especially in diseases of the brain and eyes. (l. ult.\r\ni, 483.) Avicenna gives an accurate description of it, as far as we can\r\njudge from the wretched translation of his works. He recommends it in\r\nerrhines with saffron, and with a little camphor for vertigo, and other\r\naffections of the brain. He also thinks favorably of it as a cordial\r\nin affections of the heart, and in melancholy. He concludes by saying\r\nof it that it is alexipharmic, especially in cases of poisoning with\r\nnapellus. (ii, 2, 452.) See also his treatise (de Med. cordial., ii.)\r\nThere does not appear any distinct mention of it in the works of Mesue\r\nthe younger. It occurs frequently as an ingredient in the antidotes\r\nof Myrepsus. Ebn Baithar gives a very full description of it and its\r\nmedicinal virtues, but it agrees so well with the description of it by\r\nSerapion, that we need not enter much into particulars. He recommends it\r\nparticularly in diseases of the eyes, and says that the oil of it is a\r\nuseful application to piles, and when rubbed into the genital member, is\r\nstrongly aphrodisiac. It is, moreover, said to be an excellent cordial.\r\nOf the Greek authorities Symeon Seth is the only one that gives anything\r\nlike a distinct account of musk. He describes three kinds, of which the\r\nbest is procured from a city east of Chorasan called _Trepet_ (Thibet?).\r\nThe next in quality is the Indian, and the worst is that which is\r\nprocured from the Sines (Chinese?). All the kinds, he says, are formed in\r\nthe umbilicus of an animal with one horn, resembling the gazelle. Like\r\nSerapion he states that it is got from the animal while in a state of\r\nsexual orgasm. Musk, he says, is hot and dry in the third degree, and of\r\na volatile nature. As to its medicinal powers, it strengthens weak parts,\r\nand is beneficial in cold intemperaments of the head, but injurious in\r\nhot. It is adapted for the recovery of persons in a fainting fit, in loss\r\nof strength, and in affections of the heart. (De Alimentis.) An antidote\r\nof musk occurs in Actuarius. (Meth. Med. v, 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volubilis._\r\n\r\nThis name is loosely applied by the Arabian authorities to several genera\r\nof the climbing plants. For example under this head Serapion describes\r\nthe _lebleb_ or _cussus_, the _acfin_, the _atthin_, and _lebleb maju_.\r\nOf these the first is unquestionably the κισσὸς or ivy, and is described\r\nin extracts from Dioscorides and Galen. Of the _acfin_ he says that it is\r\nlaxative, and quotes Dioscorides as saying that it loosens the bowels.\r\nHe says the _atthin_ is styptic, and quotes Dioscorides and Galen as\r\nrecommending it in rheums of the eyes, and fluxes of the bowels. The\r\nlast or _lebleb_ he describes upon the authority of Aben Mesuai, who\r\nsays it is hot in the middle of the first degree, dry in the beginning\r\nof the same, of a cutting nature with some saline properties, and purges\r\nadust bile. Afterwards he describes its medicinal powers in the same\r\nterms as Dioscorides and Galen describe the _cissus_, that is to say, he\r\nrepresents it as being rather a medicine than an article of food; says\r\nit purges bile in doses of from one third to two thirds of a pound, when\r\nclarified without boiling, by means of ten drachms of sugar or penidia.\r\nHis next authority, Isaac ebn Amram, says it is deobstruent. Alkanzi says\r\nit is cold and dry, is purgative and useful in indurations. His last\r\nauthority, Abix, says the _lebleb_ is cold and moistening, cholagogue,\r\nand along with cassia fistula and oil of almonds it proves useful in\r\nclearing out the bowels, and relieves coughs. (De Simpl. 42.) Avicenna\r\nunder the head of _Volubilis_, i. e. _hedera_ (ii, 2, 724), and under\r\n_Cussus_ (ib. 169), describes the κισσὸς of Dioscorides, but the former\r\nof these rather confusedly so as to create suspicions that he used the\r\nterm in rather a lax manner. Mesue is the ancient author who treats\r\nmost elaborately of the _volubilis_, applying the term to five distinct\r\nspecies, or rather genera, of which the first is probably the Hedera, the\r\nsecond the Helxine, and the third the Clematis of the Greeks; the fourth,\r\nwhich he calls lupulus, is acknowledged to be the _Humulus lupulus_, and\r\nthe fifth the _Convolvulus scammonium_. See his learned commentator Costa\r\n(c. 24.) As all the others have been already treated of, we shall confine\r\nour attention at present to the account which he gives of the medicinal\r\npowers of the _hops_. He says the lupulus brings away some yellow bile,\r\nclears the blood, allays its inflammation, and that its infusion or whey\r\nis of great use for this purpose, and its syrup, he adds, cures jaundice.\r\nHe says it was little used by the physicians of his time. He recommends\r\nit as a deobstruent of the liver, and of other internal viscera, as a\r\nremedy in asthma, and protracted fevers; and as a plaster to the head\r\nwith rose oil or oil of chamomile, &c. (i, 24.) He treats of scammony\r\nseparately in the next chapter. The character thus drawn of the _lupulus_\r\ndoes not seem at first sight to agree well with the acknowledged virtues\r\nof the _Humulus Lupulus_. But, as Rutty remarks, he probably alludes to\r\nthe stem and not to the flowers of the plant, as being a medicine which\r\npurges yellow bile. (M. M. 296.) The _Humulus Lupulus_ is not noticed by\r\nany Greek writer, nor by any Roman, with the exception of Pliny. (H. N.\r\nxxi, 50.)\r\n\r\nThe _lebleb_, noticed above, there is every reason to suppose, was the\r\n_dolichos lebleb_. It is also treated of by Avicenna as well as Serapion.\r\nThey represent it as containing saltish juices which purge adust bile.\r\nIt is a well-known article in Hindoo Medicine. See Wise (Book of Hindoo\r\nMedicine, 104.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abrong_, or _Abrugi_.\r\n\r\nSerapion describes it as a round grain, spotted with black and white,\r\nwhich is brought from Seni (China?), having a bitter taste, hot and\r\ndry in the second degree, a laxative of the bowels, and vermifuge. (De\r\nSimpl. 153.) According to Dodonæus and Parkinson, it is the pea which\r\nthe latter describes and represents under the name of _pisum cordatum\r\nvesicarium_. See Theatre of Plants (1378.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ribes._\r\n\r\nThis has been supposed the ribes _or_ raspberry, but it is now well\r\nascertained that it is a species of _Rheum_, namely the _Rheum Ribes_.\r\nSee Sprengel (R. H. H. i, 257.) Serapion gives a full account of it;\r\nhe represents it to be a cold, astringent plant, and recommends it\r\nin various complaints, such as cholera, smallpox, measles, and in\r\nhemorrhoids. (De Simpl. 241.) Avicenna briefly recommends it in nearly\r\nthe same complaints. (ii, 2, 581.) See also Rhases (Cont. l. ult. i,\r\n582.) Ebn Baithar gives a full and very interesting description of it.\r\nHe says it grows in alpine localities in Syria, and in the northern\r\ncountries, but not in Spain; that it has large, broad, round leaves, and\r\ntender reddish spots. He calls it bitter and astringent, and recommends\r\nit in palpitation of the heart, vomiting, and marasmus. He also praises\r\nit in hemorrhoids, and the red flux (menorrhagia) of women; and further\r\ncommends it in measles, smallpox, and plague. Dr. Royle says (M. M. 521)\r\nthat the _Rheum Ribes_ is “the _Riwas_ of Serapion, who mentions it as\r\nmaking a good sherbet.” Does he allude to the chapter on the _Ribes_\r\nquoted above?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aurantium._\r\n\r\nWhen we stated in another place (Vol. I, 134) that no ancient author had\r\nnoticed the _orange_, we were unacquainted with the works of Ebn Baithar,\r\nand of D’Hanvantare, the author of the Susruta. In the latter work the\r\norange is enumerated with acid fruits, of a somewhat indigestible nature.\r\n(140 et alibi.) Ebn Baithar says of the orange that it produces an oil\r\nwhich is useful in flatulence and pains of the joints. The rind of the\r\nfruit, he says, is carminative and anthelminthic, an antidote to poisons,\r\nand removes spots from clothes. The Hindoos have been long familiar with\r\nthe _Citrus aurantium_. See the Susruta and Wise’s Hindoo Medicine (p.\r\n191.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limon._\r\n\r\nWe are now inclined to think that we were mistaken in stating (Vol.\r\nI. 137) that the lemon was mentioned by Avicenna (ii, 2, 433.) His\r\ndescription is probably to be referred to the _Statice limonium_.\r\nHowever, beyond all doubt, the _Citrus medica Limon_ is fully described\r\nby Ebn Baithar. He says the rind is bitter, acid, astringent, and\r\naromatic, excites the appetite, improves digestion, renders the breath\r\nfragrant, is cordial, and an antidote to poisons. He recommends it\r\nparticularly in fevers, exanthemata, palpitation of the heart, vomiting,\r\n&c. It appears also to be noticed several times in the Susruta. (See p.\r\n142 et alibi.) Lemons are likewise noticed by the Persian writers on the\r\nMateria Medica by the names of _Leemoo_ and _Neemboo_. See Royle (Mat.\r\nMed. 297.) They have been long known to the Hindoos. See Wise (Hindoo\r\nMed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Margaritæ._\r\n\r\nThough the Greeks and Romans were well acquainted with pearl-mussels, as\r\nis obvious from several passages in the classical authors, it does not\r\nappear that they ever used these articles in the practice of medicine.\r\nThey were used by the Arabians as an ingredient in their celebrated\r\nElectuarium _de Gemmis_, (Mesue _de Elect._) and were reckoned among\r\ntheir cordial medicines. Avicenna says of pearls, that they resemble\r\n_karabe_ in medicinal powers, but are more powerful in their operation.\r\n(De Med. Cordial.) Serapion gives a fuller account of them upon the\r\nauthority of several Arabian writers, who describe pearls as being cold,\r\ndesiccant, and attenuant, and recommend them in diseases of the eyes,\r\nand in hemorrhages, as dentifrices in diseases of the teeth, but more\r\nespecially as cordials in palpitations and other affections of the heart.\r\n(De Simpl. 397.) We could have wished to have given in this place, since\r\nwe have had no convenient opportunity to do so elsewhere, an exposition\r\nof the views of the Arabians respecting the operation of _cordial\r\nmedicines_; but as this subject could not be understood without a fuller\r\nexplanation of certain parts of the higher philosophy of the ancients\r\nthan is consistent with our limits, we are reluctantly obliged to dismiss\r\nit with a very brief notice. We would beg leave to refer our readers to\r\nAvicenna’s elaborate treatise ‘de Medicinis Cordialibus.’ He there gives\r\nan ingenious disquisition on medicines which operate upon the animal\r\nspirits and dispel vapours, and first advocates views which have formed\r\nthe basis of many a modern hypothesis on this subject. Among the cordial\r\nmedicines described by him we would remark amber, gold, silver, citron,\r\ncoral, cinnamon, camphor, myrobalans, hyacinth (the gem), lapis lazuli,\r\nmyrtle, musk, mace, frankincense, silk, sandal-wood, tamarinds, zerumbet,\r\nzeduary, &c. One important class of cordials consists of medicines which\r\nevacuate black bile, namely, melanogogues, which we will have to treat of\r\nin a subsequent section of this work.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of the Arabians, Paracelsus and the modern alchemists have\r\nattributed great virtues to the precious metals and stones as cordial\r\nmedicines. See Schröder (Chemical Dispensatory, pluries.) He says of\r\npearls, that “they are an excellent cordial, that strengthens the balsam\r\nof life, resists poison, pestilence, and putrefaction, and clear the\r\nspirits.” (167.) Pearls and other precious stones have always been highly\r\nesteemed by the Hindoo physicians. See the Susruta and Wise’s Hindoo\r\nMedicine (124.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sericum._\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above, that silk is one of the cordial medicines\r\ntreated of by Avicenna. Silk, and especially raw silk, he says, is\r\nattenuant and desiccative, acts as a cordial, improves the memory, proves\r\nuseful in affections of the eyes, in obstructions of the liver and other\r\ncomplaints. (De Med. Cord. ii, 3.) The silkworm (_bombyx mori_) and\r\nthe uses of silk in medicine, are described with considerable accuracy\r\nby Serapion. Like Avicenna he ranks it with the cordial medicines,\r\nand recommends it in this capacity along with pearls, karabe, corals,\r\nand musk. (De Simpl. c. 28.) Silk forms one of the ingredients in the\r\nelectuary of Mesue, to which he gives the following imposing title,\r\n“Electuarium ex granis tinctoriis ad cordis palpitationem, syncopem,\r\nmentis alienationem, seu desipentiam, moerorem sine causa manifesta,\r\nfacultates enim nostrum corpus dispensantes mirifice roborat.” See f.\r\n89, and the interesting Commentary of Costa. It is also an ingredient in\r\nseveral of the Antidotaria of Avenzoar. Ebn Baithar says, that various\r\nArabian authors had written on the medicinal properties of silk. One of\r\nthem quoted by him describes the use of it in medicine by burning it,\r\nand using its ashes for collyria and other purposes. He remarks, that\r\nEbn Sina (Avicenna) says, that silk as an article of clothing prevents\r\nthe formation of lice. Raw silk has been used as a medicine in modern\r\ntimes. Moses Charras, in his ‘Royal Pharmacopœia,’ writes thus of it:\r\n“Many writers have attributed great virtue to raw silk. But although the\r\nuse thereof had been at all times unknown in physic, my judgment is that\r\nit is too fragrant, that it has too much beauty, that it affords too\r\nmany conveniences to human life, that there are too many wonders in the\r\nfirst original, progress, labour, and metamorphosis of the worm which\r\nproduces it, to be despised.” He adds, “that is called raw silk which\r\nwas never boiled, but is still as it were in the grain, out of which\r\nthe worm has been but newly taken.” He says further of the composition,\r\nwhereof raw silk is an ingredient, namely, _Confectio alkermes regia_,\r\n“This confection is, without question, one of the best cordials that\r\never Galenic physic invented. For it repairs and recreates the vital and\r\nanimal spirits, it ceases palpitations of the heart and swooning-fits; it\r\nfortifies the brain, &c.” (R. P. 149.) A still more recent authority on\r\npharmacy, says of raw silk, _Sericum_, that it is “cordial, restorative,\r\none drachm in powder.” Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 215.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hyacinthus._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the precious stones which often occurs as an ingredient\r\nin the Arabian formulæ for antidotes. Ebn Baithar remarks, that it is\r\nnot described by Dioscorides nor Galen. He mentions three kinds, a\r\nyellow, a red, and a black, of which the red is the noblest. Its powers,\r\nhe says, are increased by fire. It was used as an amulet, and was held\r\nto be cordial and alexipharmic; and, in fact, Ebn Baithar says it is\r\npossessed of many virtues. From his mentioning of it, that, when rubbed,\r\nit attracts straw, there seems every reason to suppose that it was\r\ntourmaline. Some have taken the hyacinth of the Greeks and Romans for the\r\nsame, but Heeren rather supposes it to be the ruby. It is briefly noticed\r\nas a cordial by Avicenna, Mesue, and Serapion. The last of these gives\r\nnearly the same account of it as Ebn Baithar; that is to say, both had\r\ncopied from the same authorities. He particularly mentions it as being an\r\nexcellent phylactery to guard the body during thunder-storms. (De Simpl.\r\n398.) The _Confectio de Hyacintho_ has been very celebrated in modern\r\ntimes. See Moses Charras (Roy. Pharmacop. 147.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hager Albuzedi._\r\n\r\nIt is thus described by Serapion: “Hager albuzedi is a red stone, but\r\nless so than the hyacinth, the redness of which is more agreeable to\r\nthe eye, as there is no obscurity in it. The mines where this stone is\r\nfound are in the East. When taken from the mine it is opake; but when\r\ndivested of its outer coat by a lapidary, its goodness is discovered and\r\nit becomes transparent. When this stone has been strongly rubbed against\r\nthe hair of the head, it attracts chaff, as the magnet does iron.” He\r\nspeaks of its being useful to the eyes when they are rubbed with it, and\r\nsays that as a seal it dispels frightsome dreams. (de Mineral. 399.)\r\nAccording to Beckmann this is most probably not the tourmaline, although\r\nit bears some resemblance to it in properties, but belongs rather to the\r\nhyacinths. (History of Inventions.) In fact, it would appear to us highly\r\nprobable, that this article like the preceding was a variety of the ruby.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hager Salachil_, or _Lapis Corneolus_.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of it are described by Serapion, of which the best he\r\nsays is the red. They are brought, he adds, from the mines of the Romans,\r\nand were used principally as an amulet and dentifrice. It must have been\r\nthe same as the _Sardion_ of Theophrastus (De Lapidibus), and of Plato\r\n(Timæus.) The term would appear to have been used in a general sense\r\nfor several of the finer kinds of agates. (De Simpl. 400.) A modern\r\nauthority thus describes it: “The Sarda _or_ Cornelian. It is a gem half\r\ntransparent, like the water wherein flesh is washed, or like bloody\r\nflesh: hence it is called Carneolus or Cornelian. The best cornelians are\r\nfound in Sardinia.” Schröder (Chemical Dispensatory, p. 160.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tincar_, or _Borax_.\r\n\r\nWe have treated of this article already under the head of _Chrysocolla_,\r\nwith which it has been often confounded. It was introduced into medical\r\npractice by the Arabians, and there appears to us no doubt that it was\r\nthe same as our borate of soda. It was very much used for the cure of\r\ntoothache. See the authorities quoted under _Chrysocolla_. It was used\r\nmedicinally by the Hindoo physicians. See the Susruta (pluries), Wise\r\n(Hindoo System of Medicine, 117); Ainslie (Mat. Ind. 576); Royle (Mat.\r\nMed. 97.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hager Alcazaha._\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine precisely what this precious stone was,\r\nalthough it is pretty minutely described by Serapion. He says it is\r\nbrought from Yemen, and is of divers colours, from white to black, and\r\nthat it occasions disturbed dreams when worn as an amulet: he recommends\r\nit, however, to be thus used by infants, and says a vessel prepared from\r\nit, if used for holding any article of food or drink, prevents sleep. (De\r\nSimpl. 401.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lapis Lazuli._\r\n\r\nWe have in so far treated of this substance under _Cyanus_ in the\r\npreceding Commentary. It was used, like the other precious stones, as an\r\namulet, but was more particularly celebrated as a melanogogue medicine.\r\nIt was further said to be useful in asthma, and as an emmenagogue.\r\nSee Serapion (De Simpl. 369); Avicenna (ii, 256). A modern authority\r\ndescribes it thus: “It is a stone like a sapphire, or the flowers of\r\ncyanus adorned with golden stones or flowers, harder than the Armenian\r\nstone. It is in virtue like the Armenian stone, but weaker; it purgeth\r\nchiefly melancholy. It is worn about the neck for an amulet to drive away\r\nfrights from children,” &c. Schröder, (Chymic. Dispensat.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berengemish_, or _Ozimum Gariofilatum_.\r\n\r\nSerapion, after quoting a description of it from Isaac ebn Amram, says\r\nof it, that it is hot and dry in the end of the second degree, is useful\r\nin coldness of the stomach, promotes digestion, is a hepatic and cordial\r\nmedicine, dispels melancholy, renders the eructations fragrant, &c.\r\nHis other authorities recommend it in similar cases. (De Simpl. 156.)\r\nAvicenna gives a similar account of it in all respects. (ii, 2, 254.)\r\nWe suppose there is no doubt that it is the clove basil, or _Ocimum\r\ngariofilatum_ of Miller; or, according to Sprengel, the _O. monachorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Behen._\r\n\r\nSerapion briefly describes two varieties of it consisting of fibrous\r\nroots, being brought from Armenia, and having a good smell with some\r\nviscidity. Both kinds, he says, are hot and humid, and increase the\r\nsecretion of semen. (De Simpl. 223.) See also Avicenna (ii, 2, 82), and\r\nRhases (Contin. l. ult. iii, 29.) Avicenna holds that it is also cordial\r\nin addition to its power of forming semen. It is the _Centaurea Behen_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spinachia._\r\n\r\nWe have already treated of the spinach (_Spinachia oleracea_) as a\r\ndietetical article introduced by the Arabians. (Vol. I, 113.) According\r\nto Avicenna it is laxative of the bowels, useful in orthopnœa, and other\r\ndiseases of the chest. It is noticed in like terms by Serapion (De Simpl.\r\n140); by Rhases (Contin. l. ult. i, 671.) Ebn Baithar says of spinach\r\nthat it is an excellent potherb, and useful in diseases of the neck and\r\nchest, being much used for this purpose by the inhabitants of Nineveh,\r\nwho are very subject to such complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhabarbarum._\r\n\r\nWe have stated under _Rheum_ in the preceding Commentary (317), that it\r\nwas the _rheum rhaponticum_, which is the only species of the _rheum_\r\ndescribed in the regular treatises on the Mat. Med. of the Greeks and\r\nRomans. Our author, however, would seem to allude to the _Rheum barbarum_\r\nor purgative rhubarb, at Book I, 43, and VII, 11. Although it is stated\r\nby some learned authorities that the rheum of Trallian (viii, 3) was a\r\nspecies of the Rhabarbarum, we are satisfied from a careful examination\r\nof the passage, that it was the rhaponticum. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the general use of the purgative rhubarb was introduced by the\r\nArabians, of whom Ebn Baithar is by far the most copious and instructive\r\nunder this head. He states decidedly that there are four species of\r\nrhubarb, three of which are perfectly distinct. On the first species, by\r\nwhich he evidently means the _R. Rhaponticum_, he gives extracts from\r\nDioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and Paulus. He says the older physicians\r\nknew nothing of the virtues of the purgative kinds of rhubarb until\r\nthey were discovered near to his time. He says the purgative rhubarb\r\nacts as a deobstruent and strengthener of all the internal viscera, is\r\nuseful in mental diseases, dropsy, jaundice, marasmus connected with\r\nobstructions, especially when combined with gum lac. He says it is most\r\nuseful in chronic diarrhœa when taken in an aromatic wine and with Indian\r\nspikenard, and also in uterine fluxes, dyspepsia, and other complaints\r\nof a similar nature. He praises it most especially as a stomachic.\r\nHe states, that of all the kinds of rhubarb, the Turkish possesses\r\nthe purgative quality in the highest degree. Of the other Arabian\r\nauthorities, Averrhoes is one who gives a very distinct account of the\r\ntrue purgative rhubarb. (Collig. v, 42.) Mesue describes three species of\r\nthe Rhabarbarum, _or_ Rhaued, namely, Indianum, Barbarum, and Turcicum,\r\nto all of which he ascribes purgative powers, and recommends them as\r\nbeing possessed of hepatic, stomachic, and deobstruent properties, which\r\nrender them particularly serviceable in dropsy, obstructions of the\r\nspleen, and jaundice. The dose of the infusion, he says, is from one to\r\nten drs.; and of the pounded, from one to three. He appears not to have\r\nbeen acquainted with the Rhaponticum (De Simpl. v), whereas Avicenna and\r\nSerapion would seem not to have known the other. It may be proper to\r\nmention, in conclusion, that the Rheum rhaponticum is the common culinary\r\nor tart rhubarb of this country. According to Loudon, it was introduced\r\nin 1573, but it is most probable that we owe the introduction of it to\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is time that we should draw this Appendix to a close. And now we\r\ntrust it will not be thought out of place to conclude with Professor\r\nBeckmann’s eloquent eulogy on the Literature of the Arabians in his\r\ncelebrated work on the ‘History of Inventions and Discoveries.’\r\n\r\n“What a noble people were the Arabs! We are indebted to them for much\r\nknowledge and for many inventions of great utility; and we should have\r\nstill more to thank them for were we fully aware of the benefits we\r\nhave derived from them. What a pity that their works should be suffered\r\nto moulder into dust, without being made available! What a shame that\r\nthose acquainted with this rich language should meet with so little\r\nencouragement! The few old translations which exist have been made by\r\npersons who were not sufficiently acquainted either with languages or\r\nthe sciences. On that account they are for the most part unintelligible,\r\nuncertain, in many places corrupted, and besides, exceedingly scarce.\r\nEven when obtained, the possessors are pretty much in the same state as\r\nthose who make their way with great trouble to a treasure, which, after\r\nall, they are only permitted to see at a distance through a narrow gate.\r\nHad I still twenty years to live, and could hope for an abundant supply\r\nof Arabic works, I would learn Arabic. But ὁ βίος βραχὺς, ἡ δὲ τέχνη\r\nμακρή.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.—ON SIMPLE PURGATIVE MEDICINES.\r\n\r\nGive of aloes one drachm, with honeyed water, in the morning. But they\r\nwho administer it in the evening or after food occasion mischief, for\r\nit makes the food spoil. It evacuates yellow bile, less if given to the\r\nextent of three oboli, for in that case it proves solely and entirely\r\neccoprotic. But purgative medicines being generally bad for the stomach,\r\naloes alone is stomachic. Those who cannot endure the bitterness of it\r\nmay take it formed into pills. It is manifest that purgative medicines do\r\nnot evacuate by any one simple temperament such as heat (for then all hot\r\nthings would be evacuants, such as pepper), but by some specific property\r\nof their whole substance in like manner as the magnet attracts iron. Of\r\npurgative medicines those which are simply laxative have been treated of\r\nin the First Book. We are to use drastic purgatives either in order to\r\ntransfer some matter, or to dislodge and remove an indurated diathesis,\r\nor as an alterative to the system, and in order to change the temperament\r\nof it, or to displace any offending humour. There are certain mixed modes\r\ncomplicated of the afore-mentioned. Purgative medicines are to be given\r\nto those whose powers are firm and their understanding strong; to such as\r\nhave passed the first stage of life, and have not yet come to the last;\r\nto those who have a strong stomach, and have collections of superfluous\r\nmatters in the body, and are not very sanguineous. The best seasons for\r\npurging, if there be no urgent necessity, are the spring and the autumn.\r\n\r\n_On those things which evacuate bile._ We may give cholagogue medicines\r\nat any season except winter, to persons in the vigour of life and in the\r\ndecline; to persons of dry and muscular habits, and who are of a dark\r\nor ruddy complexion; to men rather than to women; to those whose food\r\nis apt to spoil on their stomachs, and whose bellies are constipated;\r\nto such as abound in bitter bile, are irascible, pass little urine, and\r\nuse hot and dry food: in icteric, hepatic, and pleuritic affections; in\r\nphrenitis, cynanche, mania, cephalæa, ophthalmy, erysipelas, leprosy,\r\nfevers, and to such as are troubled with collections of bile. Aloes\r\nis given to such as are troubled with heaviness of the head, with\r\nophthalmy, with thirst, with disturbed dreams without fever; to such as\r\nhave a sensation of departing rigor; to those who pass acrid flatus,\r\nand have gnawing pains of the intestines; to those who are seized with\r\nburning heat about the stomach, or nausea producing eversion of it;\r\nand to those who being troubled with a collection of excrementitious\r\nmatters cannot bear evacuations by clysters. For it evacuates the whole\r\nbody, and does not occasion disorder of it unless given in very great\r\nquantity, and brings along with it any bile lying in the intestines,\r\nstomach, and gullet.—Hellebore agrees both with those in acute diseases\r\nand those in chronic requiring a cholagogue medicine, such as maniacs,\r\nthose troubled with hemicrania, and such as have defluxions of the eyes\r\nand complaints in the chest. But it suits most with such viscera as the\r\nuterus and bladder when they require a cholagogue remedy. It is also\r\nproper for chronic affections of the trachea, for jaundice, exanthemata,\r\nlichen, herpes, erysipelas, and leprosy. Black hellebore evacuates bile,\r\nespecially yellow, from the whole body and without trouble. Hence it\r\nis given to those not affected with heavy fever, and more especially\r\nto such as are free from fever, in the quantity of one drachm of the\r\nroots triturated in honeyed water or plain water, while fasting, or\r\nwith honey made into pills. Some mix with it pennyroyal, savoury, or\r\nsome of the volatile stomachics.—Scammony purges like hellebore, and\r\nmore especially yellow bile, but of all purgative medicines it is the\r\nmost prejudicial to the stomach. It is, therefore, to be given to those\r\nwho are free from fever, and such as have strong stomachs, to the\r\namount of four oboli, with salts, pepper, ginger, or some one of the\r\nvolatile stomachics, or along with honey. It is also formed into pills\r\nwith gum.—The medullary part of the fruit of the Colocynth evacuates\r\nespecially bile and mucous matters, not from the blood like hellebore\r\nand scammony, but from the nerves and nervous parts, when given to the\r\namount of one drachm in two cyathi of honeyed water which has rue boiled\r\nin it. But it is to be triturated for a long time, because otherwise\r\nits rough particles sticking in the internal parts produce ulcerations\r\nand nervous affections by sympathy. It is to be given to those who have\r\naffections of the head, namely, when the meninx or the pericranium\r\nis affected, such as those labouring under vertigo or hemicrania, or\r\nthose troubled with cephalæa; also in epilepsy, apoplexy, cynic spasms,\r\nchronic defluxions on the eyes, orthopnœa, asthma, and chronic coughs;\r\nlikewise in arthritic cases to those who have affections about the\r\nkidneys or bladder.—Elaterium evacuates like scammony. Such as is green\r\nlike leeks, light, and not older than a year, is to be chosen; and it is\r\nto be given to the amount of three oboli, triturated with one hemina of\r\nmilk.—Tithymallus, _spurge_, evacuates bile like elaterium and scammony.\r\nFour or five drops of the juice are given, mixed with polenta and quickly\r\nswallowed. For if retained long in the mouth they ulcerate the tongue\r\nand surrounding parts.—Lathyrides (a species of spurge) purge bile like\r\nhellebore and scammony. They are to be given to the amount of seven,\r\neight, or as many as fifteen grains to such as are robust and require\r\nmuch purging, who are to be directed to chew them. But those who are\r\nweaker and have bad stomachs, must swallow them whole.—The dried tops\r\nof the Peplium are to be given to the amount of eight oboli in honeyed\r\nwater. They evacuate bile like hellebore, and occasion the breaking of\r\nwind.—Agaric has similar powers to the colocynth, but acts slowly and is\r\nnot prejudicial to the stomach. It is given to the amount of two drachms\r\nwith honeyed water. It should be very white, brittle, and not very woody\r\nnor carious.—Illyrian Iris purges in like manner when given to the amount\r\nof eight oboli in honeyed water. It ought not to be old nor carious.—The\r\nsmall Centaury by purging bile and mucus is particularly adapted for\r\ncases of ischiatic disease. The decoction is to be drunk of a drachm\r\nand a half of centaury, boiled in a hemina of water until it be reduced\r\nto the half.—The flower with the fruit of Tragoriganum is given to the\r\namount of two drachms, in honeyed water, to the same class of persons as\r\nthe black hellebore. It is more stomachic than the hellebore, but less\r\npurgative.—Four drachms of Chamelæa (mezereon?) boiled in two heminæ of\r\nhoneyed water, until reduced to a fourth part, purge like hellebore. Some\r\nadminister chamelæa by making it into pills with a double quantity of\r\nwormwood.—Aristolochia, _birthwort_, purges like colocynth, one drachm of\r\nthe species called clematis being given in honeyed water.—The dried root\r\nof Polypody when pounded and sprinkled on honeyed water, or triturated\r\nalong with it, has the same effects as colocynth.\r\n\r\n_Medicines which evacuate black bile._ Medicines which evacuate black\r\nbile are to be given in an especial manner to melancholic persons,\r\nto such as are easily moved to paroxysms, to passionate persons, to\r\nmisanthropists, to persons of solitary habits, or to such as during\r\nconvalescence require purging, during the heat of autumn, in dry habits,\r\nand to such as are not muscular.—Epithymum, _dodder of thyme_, is the\r\nbest of those medicines which evacuate black bile. It is to be given to\r\nthe amount of five drachms triturated with a hemina of milk.\r\n\r\nEpithymbrum, or the substance which grows upon savory, evacuates in like\r\nmanner with the epithymum, but is weaker. Pennyroyal, when taken to the\r\namount of an acetabulum, in honeyed water, evacuates black bile.—The\r\nHeracleatic Tragoriganum in the same dose evacuates like pennyroyal. But\r\nboth must be dried. Alypum, the seeds of it have been said to purge black\r\nbile when given in the same quantity as the epithymum with salts and\r\nvinegar; but, as Dioscorides says, it occasions slight ulceration of the\r\nintestines. It is, I think, that substance which is now called alypias.\r\nIt is to be given in honeyed water.—Parthenium (matricaria?), _feverfew_,\r\nwhen dried and drunk in like manner, evacuates the same humours. Alypon,\r\n_madwort_, drunk with salts, purges in like manner.\r\n\r\n_Medicines which evacuate phlegm._ We are to administer phlegmagogues\r\nin cold habits; to aged persons, in winter; in paralytic and apoplectic\r\ncases; for loose œdematous swellings; to such persons as have great\r\ncollections of phlegm in the belly, chest, or stomach; and in cases of\r\nthe female flux. They agree also with those who have a copious running\r\nfrom the nose and thick expectoration, with cases of anorexia and\r\nischiatic disease when the joint becomes mucous or pituitous; but they\r\nare particularly adapted for those cases of dropsy which are called\r\nanasarca.—One drachm of white Storax, drunk with an equal quantity of\r\nturpentine rosin, evacuates phlegm.—The bark of the root of Olive to the\r\namount of one drachm, with wine or water; nine oboli of Pellitory, with\r\nwater; two drachms of the seed of Lychnis (_campion_); one drachm of the\r\nroot of Sow-bread, with hydromel; two drachms of Garlic, with honey;\r\nground Pine, triturated and given in the form of pills; half a drachm of\r\nthe flakes of copper, with an equal quantity of rosin, in pills, purges\r\nbile strongly.—A drachm and half of the green leaves of Bay; two oboli of\r\nthe bark of the root of the wild Cucumber; forty seeds of that species of\r\nricinus called Crotones stripped of their bark and eaten, do the same.\r\nA half of that part of Parsley connected with the root (which some call\r\nchamæraphanus), when eaten; two drachms of Bdellium, with hydromel; but\r\nGum is particularly adapted for defluxions on the eyes.\r\n\r\n_Medicines which evacuate water._ We are to give hydragogues in that\r\nvariety of dropsical disease called ascites; to women troubled with\r\nthe whites; and to those who have ulcers accompanied with a copious\r\ndischarge.—One drachm of the flakes of Copper, when drunk with honeyed\r\nwater evacuates water; but a little vinegar must also be swallowed lest\r\nit be vomited.—The Granum Cnidium when stripped of its bark, triturated,\r\nand drunk with boiled honey, that it may not touch the orifice of the\r\nstomach, evacuates water. Twenty, twenty-five, or thirty grains are to\r\nbe given, and to those who are stronger, as many as forty.—One drachm\r\nof Euphorbium, drunk with boiled honey, evacuates phlegm, but more\r\nespecially water.—Eight oboli of the seed of rough Spleenwort, with\r\nhoneyed water, evacuate water.—Cneorum, in like manner, purges water when\r\ndrunk with polenta.—Five drachms of the seed of Cnicus, when triturated\r\ntogether in ptisan, are swallowed with a small quantity of salts.—One\r\ndrachm of Ammoniac perfume, drunk in honeyed water, evacuates water. Some\r\ngive it in affections of the spleen with oxycrate.—The juice of the bark\r\nof the root of the Elder-tree, when drunk to the amount of two ounces\r\nwith wine, evacuates water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The philosopher Aristotle thus explains his ideas respecting\r\nthe action of purgatives: “When purgatives are conveyed to the stomach,\r\nand are there dissolved, they are carried by the same passages as the\r\nfood, and when they cannot be digested, but their prevailing power\r\nremains unsubdued, they return, and carry with them whatever opposes\r\nthem, and this is called purging.” (Problem. 43.) See also Alexander\r\nAphrodisiensis (Probl. ii, 58.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates administered purgative medicines freely and boldly,\r\nbut at the same time he cautions against the unseasonable and rash\r\nadministration of them in several parts of his works. We do not find\r\nany theory, however, of the _modus operandi_ of purgatives, nor any\r\ngeneral remarks on the cases in which they are applicable, in any of the\r\nHippocratic treatises which are now acknowledged to be genuine. Some\r\ningenious remarks, however, may be found on this subject in the work ‘De\r\nNat. humana.’\r\n\r\nCelsus has a chapter on purgative medicines which contains much curious\r\nand valuable matter. He says the more ancient physicians gave various\r\npurgative medicines very freely, such as black hellebore, polypody,\r\nsquama æris, the milky juice of lactuca marina (_euphorbia paralias?_),\r\nthe milk of asses, with a little salt; but he holds that purgatives hurt\r\nthe stomach, and are not to be given when any fever is present. The\r\nrules, which he lays down for the administration of them, are highly\r\njudicious, and deserving of consideration. He approves of them when the\r\nhead feels heavy, when the eyes are misty, when there is obstruction of\r\nthe bowels, and when there is pain there or in the hip-joint, when the\r\nstomach is oppressed with bile or phlegm, and when there is dyspnœa, when\r\nvenesection is indicated, but the powers of the system will not admit of\r\nit, and in several other cases. (v, 12.) He mentions that Asclepiades\r\ntotally rejected the use of purgative medicines. (i, 3.)\r\n\r\nGalen has devoted a complete treatise to the discussion of the question\r\nregarding the _modus operandi_ of purgatives. He decidedly inclines to\r\nthe theory that every purgative by some specific property attracts, and\r\nas it were, sucks to it the humour to which it has a natural alliance,\r\nin like manner as the magnet attracts iron. He divides Purgatives into\r\nCholagogues, Melanogogues, Hydragogues, and Phlegmagogues. He rejects\r\nthe hypothesis of Erasistratus, who maintained that each medicine\r\nconverts the juices presented to it, into its own specific nature:\r\nthus that cholagogues convert them into yellow bile, melanogogues\r\ninto black bile, and so forth. Although Galen flatters himself that\r\nhe effectually demolishes this hypothesis, we have long looked upon\r\nit as a very plausible one, and believe that at the present time the\r\nprevailing opinion in the profession inclines much in that direction.\r\nFor example, the green and dark discharges which are brought off by\r\nmercurial purgatives, are now generally supposed to be occasioned by the\r\nfluids in the secretions entering into combination with the medicine\r\nadministered. It is to be regretted that no ancient author has given us\r\na clear exposition of the hypothesis of Erasistratus. Galen gives a long\r\nlist of cases, in which purgatives prove beneficial, such as erysipelas,\r\nepilepsy, apoplexy, gout, rheumatism, melancholy, and many chronic\r\ncomplaints. He insists strongly on the benefit derived from cholagogues\r\nfor the cure of jaundice. (De purg. Med. vi.)\r\n\r\nAntyllus, in an extract preserved by Aëtius, espouses the theory which\r\nmaintains the specific operation of purgatives, and that they act by\r\nattracting the humours to which they are allied. He recommends them\r\nfor various complaints, as malignant cutaneous diseases, spontaneous\r\nulceration, and rheumatic affections. (iii, 23.)\r\n\r\nThe account of this subject, given by Oribasius, is taken from the works\r\nof Galen and Ruffus. It is too lengthy for our limits. Ruffus directs the\r\nsurgeon to consider well the patient’s constitution, and regulate the\r\ndose of the medicine accordingly, as there is a great difference in the\r\nsusceptibility of persons to be acted upon by purgatives. The following\r\nis a list of the purgatives described by Ruffus in this fragment:\r\nPolypody, iris, colocynth, phacoides (a species of spurge olive?),\r\npeplos, peplium, aloe, hippophaes, hippophæstum, clematis, pycnocomon,\r\nvines, thyme, epithyme, marjoram, Greek savory, poppies, cucumber, the\r\nsmaller heliotrope, the lesser sesamoides, the tithymalli or spurges,\r\nthe chamelæa, lathyris, agaric, and euphorbium. His description of the\r\noperation of each medicine bespeaks a good acquaintance with the subject.\r\n(Med. Collect. vii, 26.) See also Actuarius (Meth. Med. iii, 7.)\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas makes some acute remarks on the action of Cathartics. Every\r\npurgative, he says, attracts the humour, to which it is allied. Different\r\nopinions, he adds, have been entertained regarding the _modus operandi_\r\nin this case. Some maintain that, when such a medicine is swallowed, it\r\ngoes to the members where its cognate humour is lodged, from which both\r\nare expelled by the expulsive faculty of the part, and return to the\r\nbowels together. This theory, however, he rejects. He mentions further\r\nthat others maintain that the medicine attracts its peculiar fluid, as\r\na magnet does iron; and of this theory he adopts a modification. He\r\nstates it as his opinion that, when such a medicine has been swallowed,\r\nit attracts its cognate fluid from the surrounding parts, to which all\r\nthe similar fluids in the body are afterwards determined, being conveyed\r\nthither by the veins. He gives a full account of all the purgatives known\r\nin his time. (Pract. iii, 53, 54.) Much the same theory is advocated, and\r\nfully explained by Serapion. (De Antidot. vii, 10.)\r\n\r\nAvicenna and Rhases object to the doctrine of Galen that he appears to\r\nhave maintained that there is a peculiar alliance between a purgative\r\nmedicine of a certain class and the fluid or humour which it attracts,\r\nwhereas they argue that, as there is no alliance between the magnet and\r\nthe iron which it attracts, so is it in like manner with purgatives and\r\nthe peculiar fluids which they evacuate. This, however, is only a more\r\nprecise exposition of the theory advanced by Galen. Rhases (Cont. xii,\r\n1); Avicenna (i, 4, 4.) The ancient theory is very acutely stated by\r\nAverrhoes (Collig. v, 21.) See also Mesue (Canones universales.) There\r\nappears to be some originality in the theory of Mesue. He says that a\r\npurgative medicine operates by occasioning a preternatural increase\r\nof the vital, or, as it is now called, animal heat of the part to\r\nwhich it is applied, whereby its attractive powers are increased. He\r\nmaintains very ingeniously that purgation is an act of Nature, that\r\nis to say, an operation of the _vis medicatrix naturæ_, and that the\r\nmedicine is merely the instrument of Nature in this case, for, he adds\r\n(as Hippocrates says), it is Nature, and not the physician, that cures\r\ndiseases. A purgative medicine, then, he argues, acts by rousing the\r\nexpulsive power of Nature. He joins the preceding authorities, however,\r\nin illustrating the attractive power of purgatives, by comparing it\r\nto the property which the magnet has of attracting iron, and amber\r\nof attracting straws. Purgative medicines, he says, have the faculty\r\nof clearing away the humours from the different parts of the body;\r\nfrom the stomach and intestines they do so readily; from the meseraic\r\nveins less easily; still more difficultly from the liver, and with\r\nthe greatest possible difficulty from the joints, especially when the\r\nhumours are impacted there. He forbids purgatives to be given in the\r\nextremes, either of hot or cold; in this practice observing the rule\r\nof Hippocrates. In hot weather, he says, emetics, and not purgatives,\r\nare indicated. The directions which he gives for correcting the noxious\r\nqualities of purgative medicines are highly important, but they are too\r\nlengthy for our limits. Aromatics added to purgatives, he says, dispel\r\nflatus; bitters do the same, and strengthen the stomach; saltish things\r\nincrease their purgative powers; unctuous, by lubricating the intestines,\r\naccelerate their operation, and render it easier; and sweet substances\r\nrender them less nauseous, and diminish their acrimony.\r\n\r\nOn the ancient arrangement of purgative medicines Dr. Paris makes the\r\nfollowing pertinent remark: “It is impossible to concede to the opinion\r\nof Dr. Hamilton, that the different species of purgative medicines do\r\nnot possess distinct powers over the different species of matter to be\r\nevacuated; on the contrary, there is reason for reviving the ancient\r\ntheory, too inconsiderately abandoned, and which acknowledged these\r\ndifferent distinctions in the operations of cathartic medicines under\r\nthe appropriate names of hydragogues, cholagogues, &c.” (Pharmacop.)\r\nDr. Alston likewise writes thus: “We have a very learned essay in\r\nconfirmation of the ancient doctrine of the specific operation of\r\npurgatives by Dr. G. Martyn (Lond. 1740, in 8vo.) I shall not enter into\r\nthe controversy, but only observe that there is nothing impossible, yea,\r\nnor improbable in the theory.” (Lectures.) See a learned dissertation on\r\nthe action of purgatives in Mangeti ‘Bibliotheca Anatomica,’ i, 159. We\r\nmay mention further that Dr. Murray in his Materia Medica inclines to the\r\nGalenic theory of the specific operation of purgatives. (c. viii.)\r\n\r\n_On Cholagogues._ Most of these medicines are sufficiently well known,\r\nand therefore do not require to be treated of at greater length. See also\r\nAëtius (iii) and Oribasius (M. Col. vii.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabian author Mesue gives the following table of Cholagogues:\r\n\r\n              _Clementer._                            _Valenter._\r\n            { Aloe                                  { Agaricus.\r\n            { Absinthium  } Trahendo et             { Asarum.\r\n            { Rosa        } astringendo,            { Aristolochia.\r\n            { Rhabarbarum } flavæ: nam aliæ         { Bryonia.\r\n            { Myrobalani  } aliud vacuant.          { Cyclaminus.\r\n            { Pruna.                                { Cucumer agrestis.\r\n  Cholagoga { Tamar Indi  } Astringendo.    Radices { Dracunculus et arum.\r\n            { Cassia      }                         { Elleborus.\r\n            { Manna.                                { Esula.\r\n            { Viola nigra } Lubricando.             { Hermodactylus.\r\n            { Psyllium    }                         { Iris.\r\n            { Adiantum etiam phl.                   { Scilla.\r\n                                                    { Turbith.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this list contains several articles with which\r\nthe Greeks were unacquainted, namely, myrobalani, tamarindi, manna, and\r\nturbith. Of all these substances we have already given some account in\r\nthe Appendix to the Third Section. Mesue calls the _tamarinds_, the fruit\r\nof an Indian palm-tree, the word _tamur_ signifying a _date_. He says,\r\nthat they are excellent medicines for repressing the acrimony of the\r\nhumours, purging bile, cooling the heat of the blood; that they prove\r\nuseful in hot fevers, jaundice, inflammation of the stomach and liver,\r\nand that they stop vomiting. He calls them refrigerants and desiccants\r\nof the second order. To prevent them from hurting the stomach by their\r\ncoldness, he recommends to give them with spikenard, mace, mastich,\r\nwormwood, fennel, or any such calefacients. Avicenna states their\r\nmedicinal characters in the same terms. Serapion says, that they are\r\ndesiccants and refrigerants in the third degree. Averrhoes ranks them\r\namong the refrigerants of the third, and desiccants of the second order.\r\nWe have already mentioned, that the earlier commentators are decidedly\r\nof opinion, that the tripolium of the Greeks was _turbith_, but this is\r\nnow generally acknowledged to have been a mistake. Mesue calls it the\r\nroot of a milky herb, having leaves like a ferula, but smaller. Probably,\r\nhowever, as his commentator Manardus remarks, there is some mistake in\r\nthe comparison of it to the ferula, as there is no resemblance between\r\nthem. An accurate modern author, Moses Charras, calls it the bark of\r\na milky root, which is chosen by its weight, dark-coloured without,\r\nwhite within, and clear from its pith, which is hard and fibrous. Mesue\r\nrepresents it to be a hot, nauseous purgative. It is given in powder, he\r\nsays, to the amount of from one to two drachms.\r\n\r\nSerapion recommends Cholagogues particularly in jaundice, inflammatory\r\naffections of the brain, mania, epilepsy, erysipelas, herpes, and\r\ntertian fever. He describes the following medicines as cholagogues:\r\naloes, southernwood, black hellebore, scammony, colocynth, agaric,\r\nclaterium, two species of mezereon, lathyris, the root of the lily,\r\ncentaury, polypody, birthwort, myrobalaus (the yellow, the black, and\r\nthe chebulic), pomegranate, cassia fistula, violet, ivy, and two Arabian\r\nsubstances _anabac_ and _alterariabin_. We are unable to determine what\r\nthe last two were.\r\n\r\nA modern writer, Christianus Margravius, in his ‘Materia Medica\r\nContracta,’ thus enumerates the cholagogues of his time.\r\n\r\n                Cholagoga,\r\n    Cassia, manna, tamarindi, succusque rosarum,\r\n    Scammonium, myrobalani, rhabarbarum, aloe.\r\n\r\nProfessor Alpinus gives an accurate account of the ancient cholagogues.\r\n(Meth. Med. iii, 9.) The following medicines are said to be used as\r\npurgatives by the Hindoos; we give the scientific names as given by\r\nDr. Wise: 1. Convolvulus turpethum. 2. Panicum frumentaceum. 3. Croton\r\npolyandrum. 4. Anthericum tuberosum. 5. Abrus precatorius. 6. Cessampelos\r\nhexandra. 7. Asclepias geminata. 8. Clotoria ternata. 9. A kind of\r\nconvolvulus. 10. _Shabraba._ 11. Cassia fistula. 12. Plumbago zeylanica.\r\n13. Acheranthes aspera. 14. Poa cynosurides. 15. Saccharum spontaneum.\r\n16. _Jelaka?_. 17. A variety of the convolvulus turpethum. 18. _Ramaka._\r\n19. Bignonia suaveolens. 20. Terminalia chebula. 21. Indigofera\r\ntinctoria. 22. Ricinus communis. 23. Costus speciosus. 24. Euphorbia. 25.\r\n_Suptachetta._ 26. Calotropis gigantea. 27. Halicacabum cardiospermum. Of\r\nthese the turbet, myrobalans, and castor oil, are particularly commended.\r\n(On Hindoo Medicine.)\r\n\r\n_On Melanogogues._ The other Greek authorities treat of nearly the same\r\nnumber of Melanogogues. They are treated of methodically by Galen,\r\nOribasius, and Aëtius. The _Alypias_ is supposed by Bernard (Nota in\r\nNonni Epit.), and Prosper Alpinus, to have been the turbith; but, as is\r\nnow maintained, erroneously. See Sprengel’s Notes on Dioscorides (iv,\r\n177) and the preceding _Appendix_.\r\n\r\nThe following is Mesue’s list of Melanogogues:\r\n\r\n               _Clementer._                           _Valenter._\r\n             { Stæchas.                               { Balanus Myrepsica.\r\n             { Aqua lactis.                           { Centaurium.\r\n             { Fumaria.

Averrhoes, accordingly, ranks it among the newly-discovered\r\nmedicines. He says, that it is both phlegmagogue and cholagogue. Serapion\r\nand Rhases give nearly the same account of it. They state the minimum\r\ndose of the powdered leaves at one drachm, and of the decoction at five\r\ndrachms. Mesue directs us to prepare a vinous tincture by infusing\r\nthe leaves in musk. He recommends us to correct its nauseousness and\r\nunpleasant effects by the addition of ginger, and other cordials. He says\r\nthat it cleanses the liver and spleen. Actuarius briefly notices it. He\r\nsays it evacuates bile and phlegm. (Meth. Med. v, 8.) See Appendix. The\r\nArabian authors represent the lapis lazuli to be the same as the lapis\r\narmenus of the Greeks. We have stated what we believe to be the truth of\r\nthe matter in the preceding commentary. Margravius, in his enumeration of\r\nmelanogogues, makes a distinction between them:\r\n\r\n                    Melanogoga—\r\n    Sunt ludiæ balani, lazuli lapis, armenusque,\r\n    Senna, polypodium quernum, helleborusque, epithymum.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes states that the lapis lazuli is the most potent medicine of\r\nthis class. (Collig. v, 43.)\r\n\r\n_On Phlegmagogues._ Mesue’s list is as follows:\r\n\r\n                       _Clementer._                     _Valenter._\r\n               { Cnicus.                              { Euphorbium.\r\n  Phlegmagoga  { Lupulus.                  Lachryma   { Opoponax.\r\n               { Hyssopus.                            { Scammonium.\r\n               { Eupatorium etiam cholag.             { Sagapenum.\r\n                                                      { Sarcocolla.\r\n\r\nSerapion directs us to administer these medicines to persons of a cold\r\nhabit, in cold seasons of the year, to those affected with anasarca and\r\napoplexy, in sciatica and hemorrhages. His list is little different from\r\nour author’s. Margravius enumerates the phlegmagogues as follows:\r\n\r\n                      Phlegmagoga—\r\n    Carthamus, agaricus, turpeth, mechoaca, jalappa,\r\n    Emblica, belliricæ, chebulæ, colocynthis, amara,\r\n    Hermodactylus, euphorbium, opoponax, sagapenum.\r\n\r\n_On Hydragogues._ The hydragogue properties of the elder-tree are\r\ncommended by Boerhaave and Sydenham. See the section on Dropsy in the\r\nThird Book.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in determining what the cneoros was. We are\r\ninclined to think that it was the _cassia fistula_, the medicinal\r\ncharacters of which, as stated by Mesue among the Arabian, and Prosper\r\nAlpinus among the modern, authorities, correspond with the account of\r\ncneoros given by our author.\r\n\r\nGum ammoniac is an ingredient of the purgative salt, a receipt for\r\nwhich is given by Apicius. It also enters into the sales purgatorii of\r\nMyrepsus. (ii, 9 and 10.) See the commentary on the next Section.\r\n\r\nProsper Alpinus says of the coccum gnidium, or fruit of the thymelæa,\r\nthat in doses of fifteen grains it is a strong purgative, and evacuates\r\nprincipally serous humours in dropsy. He reckons the squama æris among\r\nthe drastic purgatives.\r\n\r\nSerapion’s account of the hydragogues is nearly the same as our author’s.\r\nThe following is Margravius’s list of them:\r\n\r\n    Esula, gratiola, atque ireos succus, mechoaca,\r\n    Post ebuli semen, et succus, cortexcque elaterium,\r\n    Soldanella virens, et gummi gutta, jalappa.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

On the following\r\nday, having evacuated the oil, boil the colocynths in water until they\r\nare reduced to a soft consistence; then throw them away, and the oil\r\nbeing mixed with water, add to it three oboli of black hellebore, and\r\nof scammony, dr. j; but boiling along with them a pap of similago, or\r\ndried bread pounded, and then give of it to the patient, who has been\r\nformerly restricted to a simple diet, to the size of eight, ten, or at\r\nmost fourteen filberts; and let him drink hot water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It may be proper in this place to apprize the reader of\r\nthe reason why he will not find the remainder of the work so copiously\r\nillustrated by notes as the preceding parts of it. The combination of\r\nsimple medicines in pharmaceutical preparations is so arbitrary, and so\r\nlittle regulated by any fixed principle, that it is seldom we can find\r\nany two authors exactly agreeing as to the ingredients which enter into\r\nany one preparation. Now to follow all the ancient writers on pharmacy\r\nthrough all their complex formulæ, and point out every little difference\r\nwhich prevails among them, would be a very wearisome task, and one which\r\nwould scarcely recompense us or our readers for the time and attention\r\nwhich such an undertaking would necessarily demand; and neither is it\r\nmuch required, since, as will be seen, our author’s system of pharmacy is\r\nsufficiently copious and accurate for all practical purposes. We shall\r\ntherefore be content with giving a general explanation of each class of\r\nthese medicinal preparations, and only offer some occasional remarks on a\r\nfew of the more important articles.\r\n\r\nUnder this head we shall give some account of the _Halatia Cathartica_,\r\nor _Purgative Salts_ of the ancients. The ἅλες κοινὰι πεφρυγμέναι are the\r\nsame as the sal commune frictum of Apicius. Humelbergius thus explains\r\nit: “_fricti_, id est cremati et torrefacti.” The following is Apicius’s\r\nreceipt for the “Sales conditi ad multa:” Of common salt roasted, lb. j;\r\nof sal ammoniac roasted, lb. ij; of white pepper, oz. iij; of ginger,\r\noz. ij; of bishop’s weed, oz. iss; of thyme, oz. iss; of parsley-seed,\r\noz. iss. The purgative salts of Aëtius contain sal ammoniac mixed up\r\nwith many purgative and cordial medicines, such as scammony, laserwort,\r\nparsley-seed, ginger, pennyroyal, spikenard, and pepper. (iii, 109.)\r\nThese are the ingredients of a sal purgatorius recommended by Actuarius.\r\n(Meth. Med. v, 10.) Myrepsus gives prescriptions for various purgative\r\nand stomachic salts. They all consist of sal ammoniac, or common salt\r\nmixed with scammony and aromatics in different proportions. (Sect. ii.)\r\nSee also Haly Abbas. (Pract. x, 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.—ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE WHO TAKE PURGATIVE MEDICINES; AND\r\nWHAT IS TO BE DONE TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT PURGED BY A PROPER DOSE OF\r\nPURGATIVES.\r\n\r\nIn general when any of the drastic purgatives is to be taken, the\r\nmedicine is to be given to the patient with an empty stomach, and after\r\ndigestion has been performed; and he is to be prevented from sleeping\r\nuntil it has been wholly purged off, and if possible he should make\r\nmoderate motion, and abstain during the time from all food and drink,\r\nuntil the purging is over.\r\n\r\n_From the works of Philagrius._ But if he cannot endure abstinence from\r\nfood, either because the mouth of the stomach is troubled with bile\r\nfrom long fasting, which has preceded, or any such cause, we must give\r\nhim bread out of diluted wine, or the juice of ptisan, or of chondrus,\r\nnot after the evacuation has begun, lest it spoil in the stomach, but\r\nstraightway after the medicine has been taken; for in this way by its\r\nweight it contributes to the speedy evacuation of the medicine. But\r\nif, after taking any of the laxative medicines, one does not purge nor\r\nevacuate, provided the case be not at all serious, we need not be very\r\nsolicitous about it; but if the greatness of the disease be urgent, or\r\nthe patient experiences acute tearing pains with distension of the belly,\r\nwe must necessarily administer a clyster. But if even thus the belly is\r\nnot evacuated, and there is a pungent pain and disorder of the body,\r\nhe is to be bathed and rubbed freely with oil; or if he feels full and\r\nheavy, a vein must be opened, more especially if he is of a sanguineous\r\nhabit of body, and if his eyes be red and prominent, not naturally but\r\nincidentally, owing to his having drunk the medicine. When none of these\r\nsymptoms trouble him, but he experiences a gnawing and lancinating pain,\r\nhe may take food immediately after the bath, and drink wine freely, and\r\nin the meantime he is to receive a clyster, if he does not settle; and\r\nagain he is to be bathed. The oil used in the clyster, should be that of\r\nrue or prepared from some other of the carminative medicines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Hippocrates, as Galen mentions, recommends a draught of\r\nptisan to be swallowed immediately after taking a purgative medicine,\r\nin order to facilitate the operation of the medicine and wash away any\r\nparticles of it which may lodge in the intestines. Both forbid it to\r\nbe given after the operation has commenced, as it tends only to blunt\r\nthe powers of the medicine. Galen remarks, that sometimes a purgative\r\ndoes not operate, either from idiosyncrasy of the patient, or from\r\nthe smallness of the dose, or from the intestines being blocked up by\r\nindurated fæces, which must be removed by means of a clyster before the\r\nmedicine can operate. At other times, he adds, the medicine is determined\r\nto the kidneys, or is digested and converted into food. As all purgatives\r\nare bad for the stomach, he recommends us to weaken the impression of\r\nthem by the mixture of aromatic seeds, which possess attenuating and\r\ncutting powers—_Quosnam oportet purgare_, &c.\r\n\r\nOribasius treats fully of this subject in two extracts from the works of\r\nGalen and Ruffus. Ruffus directs us, when the bowels are difficult to\r\nmove, to give beforehand a soup of shell-fish, with mallows, beet, and\r\nthe like, or to administer a clyster. He forbids us to give purgatives to\r\npersons who are apt to vomit. (Med. Collect. vii, 26.)\r\n\r\nMesue has treated more fully of all the circumstances connected with\r\nthe administration of purgatives than any other ancient author. When\r\nthe operation of the medicine is retarded by flatus, or the bad state\r\nof the humours, he recommends us either to administer a clyster or give\r\nan emetic. When this arises from debility of the expulsive faculty of\r\nthe intestines, he directs us to give, first, a moderate draught of\r\ncold water, and then some astringent potion, such as one from quinces,\r\nor pears. When the passage is obstructed, he directs a clyster to be\r\nadministered; and in this case he forbids cold water to be given, as it\r\nwill increase the contraction of the intestine. When violent pains are\r\nexcited in the stomach by the medicine, he recommends an emetic, and if\r\nin the bowels, a clyster. (Canon. Univers. iii.) See also Avicenna (i,\r\niv, 8), and Rhases (Contin. xii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.—ON THE TREATMENT OF HYPERCATHARSIS.\r\n\r\nIn cases of hypercatharsis the body is to be rubbed and bathed in hot\r\nwater, and before the bath a thin, pale-coloured and yellow wine is to be\r\ngiven (for such is the most speedily distributed), and bread soaked in\r\nit, and pomegranates. But if the evacuation continue, the limbs are to\r\nbe bound with ligatures, extending from above downwards, and tightened\r\nso as to intercept the blood and spirits. A moderate quantity of the\r\ntheriac from the flesh of vipers is also to be given. For it soon passes\r\nto the skin, and quickly gives a counter-determination to the defluxion\r\nof fluids upon the belly, and blunts the poisonous and deleterious\r\nproperty as it were of the cathartics. When in want of it we may use the\r\ntheriac trochisks, and also that from seeds, and the antidote called\r\nPhilonius. Cupping-instruments are also to be applied over the stomach,\r\nand cataplasms from polenta, and wine and honey; after which we must\r\nuse the astringent epithemes. But they will derive the most sensible\r\nadvantage from frictions of the whole body, and draughts of the aforesaid\r\nmedicines. They must abstain from very cold and very hot air; for the\r\none occasions a determination from without inwards, and increases the\r\ndischarge, and the other dissipates and reduces the strength. But if\r\nthe evacuation is increased by irritation in the bowels, we must apply\r\ncataplasms of the afore-mentioned things, and injections of emollients,\r\nsuch as the fat of geese, sweet wine, nard, and the like.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Oribasius remarks, that when an overdose of a purgative\r\nmedicine has been taken, it purges first yellow bile, then black bile,\r\nand at last blood. He recommends us, in cases of hypercatharsis, to give\r\na hot draught, to apply tight ligatures and violent friction to the\r\nextremities, and cupping-instruments to the hypochondrium and back. When\r\nthe patient can readily be made to vomit, he directs us to produce this\r\noperation by the administration of a copious draught of tepid water,\r\nand by putting a feather or the fingers down the throat. This is in\r\naccordance with Celsus’s rule of practice: “Longas dejectiones supprimit\r\nvomitus.” (ii, 8.)\r\n\r\nHippocrates and Aëtius, in cases of excessive purging from the\r\nadministration of medicine, recommend the bath and a light-coloured wine\r\nbefore and after it.\r\n\r\nAvicenna lays down the rules of treatment with great precision, but\r\nthey are mostly the same as our author’s. After friction, cupping,\r\ntight ligatures, and restorative draughts have been tried, should the\r\nexcessive purging continue he recommends us to administer narcotics. (i,\r\n4, 7.) See, in like manner, Rhases (Contin. xiii, 1, 2), and Serapion\r\n(de Antid.) But Mesue is the author who has treated of all the symptoms\r\nconnected with hypercatharsis at the greatest length. He recommends us\r\nto reserve narcotics as an _ultimum remedium_, as from the unseasonable\r\nadministration of them much harm might result. He directs us to add\r\ncordials and aromatics to the narcotics. When the tenesmus is severe he\r\ndirects us to stop it by suitable enemata and suppositories. For the\r\ndebility and lassitude occasioned by too great purgation he recommends\r\na tepid bath of sweet water, and friction with warm oils. (Canones\r\nUniversales.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

This is the common method with\r\nall the hieræ. The full dose of them is dr. iv. Add to it also of salts,\r\ndr. j; of honey, two cyathi; of water, q. s.

The hieræ, for the most part, consist of drastic purgatives,\r\ncombined with aromatics. There is a great variety of these compositions\r\ndescribed in the works of the ancient winters on pharmacy. Galen makes\r\nmention of an aloetic hiera, which was much used by the celebrated\r\nArchigenes. The following is his prescription for it: “R. Aloes, dr.\r\nc; cinnamomi, nardi, xylobalsami, mastichæ chiæ, asari, croci, ā ā dr.\r\nvj.” Galen remarks, however, that the proportion of aloes is too great,\r\nand recommends us to substitute xc or lxxx dr. instead of the quantity\r\ndirected. (De comp. Med. acc. loc.) Mesue describes the composition of 6\r\nhieræ, Haly Abbas of 5, and Serapion of a much greater number. But for\r\nvariety, Myrepsus surpasses all the other authorities. He describes the\r\ncomposition of 30 hieræ. The following is his receipt for the _Hiera\r\nPicra Galeni_: “℞. Aloes flavæ, dr. xivss.; cinnamomi, croci, costi,\r\nfloris junci odorati, xylobalsami, cassiæ fistulæ puræ, mastiches, asari,\r\nrosarum, amomi, absinthii, ā ā dr. j; Tere subigendo cum mellis Attici\r\nq. s.” Moses Charras’s receipt for it is very little different.

IX.—ON LINIMENTS TO BE APPLIED TO THE ANUS, AND PURGATIVE\r\nAPPLICATIONS TO THE NAVEL.\r\n\r\n_A liniment to the anus for the discharge of flatulence._ Rue is\r\ntriturated with honey so as to form one juice, and the inner parts of the\r\nfundament rubbed with it. It becomes more efficacious if a small quantity\r\nof cumin and natron, or the juice of sowbread be added. It is daubed\r\nupon flocks of wool and introduced; or a suppository is formed with the\r\naddition of honey. For the flatus escapes freely, affording relief.\r\n\r\n_A liniment to the anus, evacuating the belly; called Chezananche._ Alum\r\nbeing triturated with honey is to be boiled until it become yellowish,\r\nand the anus is to be rubbed with it. It forces a free evacuation of many\r\nthings, but not without trouble.\r\n\r\n_An application to the navel as a laxative of the bowels._ Of sowbread,\r\ndr. iv; of natron, dr. iij; of black and white hellebore, of each,\r\ndr. ij; of colocynth, dr. iij; of scammony, dr. ij; of the juice of\r\nelaterium, dr. iv; of granum Cnidium, dr. iv; of fatty dried figs,\r\noz. ij; of the gall of bulls, oz. j. _Another_ very excellent one: of\r\nelaterium, of lathyrides, of galbanum, of sowbread, of black hellebore,\r\nof each, dr. iv; of the medullary parts of colocynth, dr. viij; of fresh\r\nwild cucumber, of scammony, of granum Cnidium, of each, dr. ij; of\r\nspurge, dr. ij; of turpentine, dr. iij; mix these with the gall of bulls,\r\nand use as a liniment. Some, by mixing with them of wax, oz. vij, and of\r\nSicyonian oil, q. s., make it of the form of a plaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. It is clear that the liniments applied to the anus were a\r\nsort of suppositories. The _Chezananche_ is described in much the same\r\nterms as our author’s by Myrepsus. The rest of his compositions of this\r\nclass are also very similar to our author’s. (xxvi, 2.) Actuarius gives a\r\nfull account of them. (Meth. Med. v, 9.)\r\n\r\nPurgative applications to the navel were much trusted to by the ancient\r\nphysicians as laxatives, but they are now seldom used. The late Dr. Kerr,\r\nof Aberdeen, however, sometimes had recourse to them, and spoke highly of\r\ntheir efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. X.—ON EMETICS, AND THE MODE OF ADMINISTERING HELLEBORE.\r\n\r\nPersons in health have recourse to emetics when the system is loaded with\r\ntoo much food or humours, and those in acute diseases, when troubled\r\nwith phlegm or the like. But neither persons in health nor those in\r\nacute diseases should be permitted to use emetics, but only in chronic\r\naffections, more especially in cases of indurations, and for such matters\r\nas require to be dislodged by forcible means, as in gout, epilepsy from\r\nthe stomach, elephantiasis, dropsy, melancholy, and the like. They are\r\nimproper in spittings of blood, weakness of the stomach, and suffocative\r\ncomplaints. The readiest of the emetics is the oil of privet (oleum\r\nCyprinum), the fingers or some feathers being dipped in it and pushed\r\ndown the throat. And dr. vij of Celtic nard taken in honeyed water\r\nevacuate upwards powerfully. In like manner v or vj dr. of betony drunk\r\nin honeyed water, and three green leaves of the daphnoides pounded and\r\neaten. And an obolus of elaterium taken in a draught of water, purges\r\nphlegm and bile upwards; and fifteen grains of stavesacre with thick\r\nhoneyed water. Of plants with bulbous roots, those usually eaten if taken\r\nraw, and the boiled roots of narcissus purge upwards. And the upper part\r\nof the root of parsley, namely, that which is exposed to the air, when\r\neaten, purges upwards. Some call it chamæraphanum. The under part of the\r\nroot purges downwards. When the whole is eaten it purges both upwards\r\nand downwards. Radishes purge less than the aforementioned, but more\r\nusefully. They are to be taken when very acrid and fresh, and cut into\r\nsmall parts; and having allowed them to soak in oxymel for two or three\r\nhours, as many of the pieces as possible are to be swallowed, so that\r\none may vomit three or four times after supper, and once if fasting. But\r\nafter, large draughts of oxymel are to be swallowed; and after walking\r\nabout for two hours, and drinking tepid water, one may compel one’s self\r\nto vomit by inserting the fingers or some feathers into the throat.\r\n\r\n_Modes of administering hellebore._ Hellebore is to be given in\r\nprotracted and severe complaints, and when all hope from other remedies\r\nis precluded, because the disease has proved stronger than them all. It\r\nis to be given in continued diseases, as dropsy, elephantiasis, cachexia,\r\nparalysis, and the like; and in certain complaints which attack at\r\nintervals, as epilepsy and gout. There being many modes of administering\r\nhellebore, the simplest, and rather the preparative for a course of\r\nhellebore, is this method: having perforated radishes with a reed, pieces\r\nof the dried roots of the finest white hellebore are to be inserted\r\ninto the perforations, and having been allowed to remain for one night\r\nthey are to be removed. Having cut the radishes in pieces they are to\r\nbe given with oxymel, in the manner described, to the patient who has\r\nbeen accustomed before to emetics, and after an interval of the number\r\nof hours mentioned, he is to be forced to vomit. The established mode\r\nof administering hellebore is as follows: having allowed two ounces of\r\nthe best hellebore to macerate in a hemina of water for five days, boil\r\nuntil only a third part of the water remain, and having expressed the\r\nhellebore, mix with the water an equal quantity of honey, and boil it\r\nuntil it thicken; and after the patient has been exercised with vomits in\r\nthe manner described, give it to him when fasting, and after digestion\r\nhas been performed, and the contents of the bowels evacuated, either\r\nspontaneously or by one or two injections, according to his strength. But\r\nthe most efficacious mode is this: having cut the roots of the hellebore\r\ninto pieces resembling the seeds of Indian corn (for when reduced to a\r\ndowny powder it occasions suffocation by its powerful action), give to\r\nthose who are of a weaker constitution dr. ij, at most, or, at least,\r\ndr. j of the hellebore, in the juice of ptisan, of halica, or the like;\r\nbut to those who are stronger, it is to be given in hot water or honeyed\r\nwater. The purging begins after three or four hours; but when it is\r\nlonger of commencing, it operates more effectually. When the vomiting\r\nis slow of beginning, give honeyed water to drink, and let the patient\r\nbe compelled to vomit by inserting feathers dipped in oil into the\r\nthroat. If even thus he will not vomit, let him be put into the bath.\r\nWhen vomiting commences, if it go on properly, we need not interfere;\r\nbut if lancinating pains or convulsions supervene, we must give a\r\nmixture of water and oil to drink. For thus is an evacuation downwards\r\noccasioned (which otherwise sometimes takes place when hellebore has been\r\nadministered), and they bear the concentration of the medicine better.\r\nWhen the patient falls into deliquium animi he is to be resuscitated\r\nby strong-smelling things and the like. Any other symptoms which may\r\nhappen to occur are to be treated in a suitable manner. When the purging\r\nis excessive, they are to be allowed to take food and sleep, and do\r\notherwise as mentioned in describing the treatment of hypercatharsis.\r\nBut if it continue, cupping-instruments are to be applied over the\r\nstomach, and ligatures tied round the limbs. When the evacuation proceeds\r\nproperly we must give to drink a moderate quantity of honeyed water, in\r\norder to wash away the superfluous particles of the medicine. After a\r\nlittle while, give some food of easy digestion. When apprehensions are\r\nentertained of the administration of hellebore by the mouth, and the\r\nmedicine is by all means required, Antyllus uses the following injection:\r\nhaving allowed two drachms of white hellebore to macerate in a sextarius\r\nof water for a day and a night, on the day following we are to boil the\r\nhellebore in the water until but a half remain. Then we are to inject it\r\nby the anus so as to produce vomiting. It purges upwards somewhat more\r\nfeebly than when the medicine is drank. After sufficient purging, an\r\nacrid suppository is to be introduced so as to occasion the discharge\r\nof the injection and stop the vomiting. After the discharge of it, an\r\ninjection of honeyed water is to be given once or twice in order to\r\nwash out the gut. The same person says: A suppository is made of white\r\nhellebore, pounded and strained, and mixed with boiled honey, which\r\npurges like the injection of hellebore. But the following is a better\r\nmethod; for we have it in our power to regulate the purging: The quantity\r\nis to be dr. ij of hellebore, and the suppository is to be wrapped round,\r\nor bound with some flocks of wool firmly. The head of this ball of wool\r\nis to be allowed to hang out of the anus, in order that after sufficient\r\npurging it may be in our power to remove the suppository. This method\r\npurges effectually, and neither occasions convulsive suffocation nor any\r\nother dangerous symptom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The gentle emetics used by the ancients on ordinary occasions\r\nhave been treated of in Book I. We have now to give some account of the\r\nmore drastic emetics.\r\n\r\nGalen and Oribasius recommend, as effectual emetics, the bulb of the\r\nnarcissus, the seed of the anagyrus, and the fleshy part of nut ben. The\r\nUnguentum irinum and the U. cyprinum are stated by Aëtius and most of the\r\nother authorities to be safe and effectual emetics. Aëtius also commends\r\nthe decoctions of hyssop and of thyme, the seed of bastard saffron\r\npounded with oily grain, the oils of sesame, radishes, and narcissus,\r\nand the leaves of the daphnoides. Nitre or an impure carbonate of soda\r\nwas also a medicine in general use as an emetic. The Lemnian earth was\r\noften given as an emetic, being a sort of red ochre. Avicenna and Rhases\r\nmake mention of a species of black turbith, called _gilbenec_, which they\r\ndescribe as an effectual emetic, but somewhat unsafe. See the Appendix.\r\nAvicenna says that tickling the throat with a feather, smeared in the oil\r\nof sesame, readily excites vomiting. He remarks that vomiting is promoted\r\nby motion and stopped by rest. The bulbus emeticus was in general use\r\nto produce vomiting. Serapion directs us to give it boiled along with\r\nhoney. He also commends the nux vomica as an emetic when given along with\r\na small quantity of salt. We need scarcely say that it is now seldom or\r\nnever given for this purpose, although it still holds a place in some of\r\nthe continental systems of Materia Medica. The earlier modern writers on\r\nmedicine recommend it freely as an emetic. See Guido de Cauliaco. (vii,\r\n1.)\r\n\r\nBut of all the medicines of this class the _white hellebore_ was\r\nundoubtedly the most powerful, and in important cases was the most\r\ngenerally used. We must, therefore, take this opportunity of describing\r\nthe forms in which it was administered. Hippocrates appears to have been\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with it as a medicine, and to have administered\r\nit very freely. Aretæus concludes his work with a spirited eulogium on\r\nhellebore; “But in all inveterate chronic diseases, when other remedies\r\nhave failed to produce the effect, this alone is to be depended upon\r\nfor the cure. For, in power, white hellebore resembles fire, and with\r\nstill greater powers hellebore, by pervading the inward parts, produces\r\nfreedom of respiration from obstruction, a healthy colour from paleness,\r\nand plumpness of body, in place of emaciation.” But on the modes of\r\nadministering hellebore, the fullest and most accurate of the ancient\r\nauthorities is Oribasius, whose interesting account of it we shall now\r\nattempt to give in an abridged form. His description is mostly taken\r\nfrom Archigenes, Herodotus, and Antyllus. He sets out, then, with giving\r\ndirections about preparing the patient for entering upon a course of\r\nhellebore. This consists principally in putting him upon a regulated\r\ndiet, and administering occasionally some of the gentler emetics,\r\nespecially the one from radishes. He, then, describes at considerable\r\nlength the marks by which good hellebore may be recognised. When broken,\r\nhe says, it ought to be white in the inside; and when taken into the\r\nmouth it ought to be felt hot and acrid, but at first of a sweetish\r\ntaste; thereafter gradually becoming more stimulant, and provoking a\r\ngreat flow of saliva, and that frequently attended with vomiting. He\r\nrecommends the following preparation of hellebore as being efficacious\r\nand perfectly safe: A pound of hellebore is to be macerated for three\r\ndays in six heminæ of water, which we are to boil at a gentle fire until\r\na third part of the water is consumed, when the hellebore is to be\r\nexpressed; then two heminæ of honey are to be added to the decoction,\r\nwhich is to be again boiled until it no longer stain the finger. Of this\r\npreparation, the dose, to those who do not require strong purging, is\r\ntwo cochlearia, but to robust persons, the quantity called a mystrum.\r\nAnother of his authorities, Antyllus, directs us to allow five drachms\r\nof the shavings of hellebore to macerate for three days in half a\r\nhemina of rain-water, after which it is to be strained and heated in a\r\ndouble vessel. Oribasius also mentions that the medicine may be given\r\nin a coarse powder. He afterwards lays down the rules of treatment when\r\nthe action of the medicine superinduces dangerous symptoms. We need\r\nnot go over this part minutely. Suffice it to say that, according to\r\ncircumstances, he directs us to provoke vomiting by tickling the throat\r\nwith feathers dipped in one of the emetic oils; to open the bowels with\r\noily clysters; and to rouse the patient when in a state of stupor, by\r\nstimulants, restoratives, shaking him, pinching him, or tossing him\r\nin a garment. He recommends hellebore in cases of mania, melancholy,\r\ninveterate pains of the hip and other joints, epilepsy, catalepsy,\r\nvertigo, chronic headache, lethargy, leprosy, and other cutaneous\r\ndiseases. He also praises it as a remedy in hydrophobia. (Med. Collect.\r\nviii.)\r\n\r\nAëtius states that hellebore is given in infusion, in decoction, and\r\nin substance, either cut into pieces or pounded and sifted. When\r\nadministered in pieces it soon begins to act as a purgative, generally\r\nwithin two hours, bringing away bile and phlegm without much trouble,\r\nand after four or five hours the medicine itself is generally vomited\r\nup, and the purging stops. When given in a fine powder it acts violently\r\nbut slowly, so that four or five hours have generally elapsed before its\r\noperation commences. He adds that in all its forms it evacuates bile and\r\nphlegm, but that it is attended with danger of bringing on convulsions\r\nor hypercatharsis. On the infusion he remarks, that it suits with old\r\npersons and children, to those who have a feeble constitution, and for\r\nthe cure of elephantiasis. Five drachms of cut hellebore are to be\r\nallowed to macerate for three days in half a hemina of rain-water, after\r\nwhich it is to be strained and heated, when the whole of the infusion\r\nis to be taken. The decoction he recommends to be given to persons of a\r\nfirmer habit of body, and in cases of mania and melancholy. It is to be\r\nthus prepared: A pound of hellebore, cut into pieces, is to be allowed\r\nto macerate for three days in two sext. of rain-water; after which it\r\nis to be boiled gently upon the coals until only a third remain; then,\r\nhaving strained it, we add to the decoction two pounds of scummed honey,\r\nand boil to the consistence of honey. It may be given as a linctus to the\r\namount of a large spoonful, or mixed with hot water in a draught, when it\r\nwill not superinduce spasms, contractions, or hypercatharsis. To those\r\nwho stand in need of more violent concussion, who are of a strong habit\r\nof body and possess fortitude, and vomit readily, it is given cut into\r\npieces; and to persons of still greater determination, or who have been\r\naccustomed to it, in the form of a sifted powder. It is to be cut into\r\npieces of the size of malt or bran, and taken in ptisan or barley-water,\r\na draught of mead or plain water being swallowed after to wash it away.\r\nThe maximum close of it is dr. iiss. Hellebore may also be pounded and\r\nsifted in a fine sieve, when the larger particles may be given in halica\r\n(barley-water?) or pottage; but the smaller particles may be formed into\r\npills with boiled honey. (iii, 131.) Macer Floridus concludes that scr.\r\nij. is a sufficient dose of the white hellebore. (De Herb. vir.)\r\n\r\nThe Arabians give this medicine in the same forms and under the same\r\ncircumstances as the Greeks. They estimate the dose of it at from dr. j\r\nto dr. ij. Mesue forbids it to be given in the form of a powder. He and\r\nHaly Abbas, however, recommend it in pills with hiera, colocynth, agaric,\r\nand various aromatics for the cure of elephantiasis and melancholy.\r\nSerapion states that there is great danger of its inducing convulsions if\r\nimproperly administered. Avicenna’s account of the modes of giving it is\r\nvery interesting.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject we shall give the observations of the celebrated\r\nProsper Alpinus: “Elleborus albus inter medicamenta vomitoria perpetuo\r\napud omnes gentes præcipuum locum obtinet, fuitque in usu elleborismus,\r\nid est, purgatio per elleborum album, admodum familiaris apud antiquos,\r\nad morbos sanatu difficillimos tollendos, cujus quidem usu complures ab\r\naffectibus ferè prorsus insanabilibus sanabantur, atque ita cito, et\r\nprobè, ut eæ sanationes miracula viderentur; unde olim antiquorum illorum\r\nmedicorum laus insigniter augebatur. Nunc vero non sine ægrotantium\r\ndamno, atque magno artis medicæ dedecore, ipsius usus apud omnes\r\nferè medicos obsolevit, qui nunc neque audent, neque sciunt, quomodo\r\nveratrum album exhibendum est.” (Med. Meth. iii, 10.) He gives the\r\nfollowing prescription for making a preparation of hellebore: “Nonnulli\r\nex recentioribus parant elleborum accipientes, ʒiss; vini dulcis\r\naromatici, lb. j; turis, ʒiss; hyperici, ʒj; sacchari, ʒij; bulliant ad\r\nconsumptionem mediatatis. Cujus decocti dant uncias tres.” He likewise\r\napproves of giving hellebore by boiling it in oil. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\nThe following is a very simple receipt for the preparation of the\r\nmel helleboratum or honey of hellebore: “Take of the roots of white\r\nhellebore, dried and sliced, one pound; of clarified honey, three pounds;\r\nof water four pints. After steeping the roots three days in the water,\r\nboil them a little while, then boil the liquor, well pressed out and\r\nstrained, with the honey to a due consistence.” Dr. Pemberton (London\r\nDispensatory, A. D. 1746.) By due consistence is meant the consistence of\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.—ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\nThe Preface of Galen’s work on Antidotes. Those compositions which\r\ncure affections not when they are applied externally, but when taken\r\ninternally, are named antidotes by the ancients. There are three\r\ndifferent kinds of them. The first are those which are administered for\r\ndeleterious substances; the second, for those animals called venomous;\r\nand the third are the remedies for affections occasioned by bad articles\r\nof food. Some antidotes profess to fulfil all these three purposes, such\r\nas the one called theriac.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the hedychroum, which forms an ingredient of the\r\ntheriac._ Of the bark of the root of aspalathus, of calamus aromaticus,\r\nof costus, of asarabacca, of xylobalsam, of valerian, of amaracus, of\r\nmastich, of each, dr. vj; of carpobalsam, dr. ij; of marum, dr. xvj; of\r\nthe flower of the rush, dr. ij; of cinnamon, dr. xxiv; of amomum, of\r\ncassia, of rheum, of each, dr. viij; of Indian nard, of the cassia leaf\r\n(malabathrum), dr. xij; of myrrh, dr. xxiv; of saffron, dr. xij; mix\r\nwith fine wine, and form into trochisks, having smeared the finger with\r\nopobalsam.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of trochisks of squills._ Having covered over the\r\nsquills with clay or dough, roast it moderately, and taking of the\r\ninner parts of it, p. ij; and of the flour of tares, p. j; and having\r\ntriturated in like manner, form trochisks.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the theriac trochisks._ Having chosen four or five\r\nvipers of a tawny colour, and recently taken, cut off their heads, and\r\nfour fingers’ breadth of the part next the tail, and having removed the\r\nskins and entrails, boil the rest in a new pot, with dill and a moderate\r\nquantity of salts, until the spines be separated from the flesh. Then\r\nremoving and cleaning away properly the flesh from the spines, and having\r\nmixed with them an equal quantity of clean bread, and triturated them\r\nin like manner, form into small balls, having your fingers smeared with\r\nopobalsam, and cool in the shade.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the theriac antidote._ Of the trochisks of squills,\r\ndr. lxviij; of the theriac trochisks, dr. xxiv; of hedychroum, dr.\r\nxxiv; of cinnamon, dr. xxiv; of common pepper, dr. xxiv; of the juice\r\nof poppies, dr. xxiv; of dried roses, dr. xv; of water-germander, of\r\nrape-seed, of Illyrian iris, of agaric, of liquorice, of opobalsam,\r\nof each, dr. xij; of myrrh, of saffron, of ginger, of rhaponticum, of\r\nthe root of cinquefoil, of calamint, of horehound, of stone-parsley,\r\nof cassidony, of costus, of white and long pepper, of dittany, of the\r\nflower of sweet rush, of male frankincense, of turpentine, of mastich,\r\nof black cassia, of spikenard, of each, dr. vj; of the flower of poley,\r\nof storax, of parsley-seed, of seseli, of shepherd’s pouch, of bishop’s\r\nweed, of germander, of ground pine, of the juice of hypocistis, of Indian\r\nleaf (malabathrum), of Celtic nard, of spignel, of gentian, of anise,\r\nof fennel-seed, of Lemnian earth, of roasted chalcitis, of amomum,\r\nof sweet-flag, of balsamum, of Pontic valerian, of St. John’s wort,\r\nof acacia, of gum, of cardamom, of each, dr. iv; of carrot-seed, of\r\ngalbanum, of sagapen, of bitumen, of opoponax, of castor, of centaury,\r\nof the species of birthwort called clematis, of each, dr. ij; of Attic\r\nhoney, lb. x; of Falernian wine, oz. ij. Put into a mortar the opium,\r\nhypocistis, myrrh, sagapen, liquorice, storax, acacia, and opoponax, and\r\nhaving poured in some honey pound and dissolve: then pouring in wine\r\nso as to cover them, macerate for three days; then having pounded the\r\nothers, unite them, and scum the honey. It is to be laid up in vessels\r\nof silver or glass, not quite full, and the covers taken off every day.\r\nIn case of need it may be used for persons bitten by venomous animals,\r\nand those who have taken anything poisonous, after seven years, a\r\nquantity of it, to the size of a filbert, being drunk twice a day, in\r\nthree cyathi of wine. In like manner, to those who are in a dangerous\r\nstate from some obscure cause, when the disorder in the body imitates the\r\nquality of a mortal poison, as is the case particularly in pestilential\r\ndiseases, it is to be given once a day. But in all other affections, it\r\nis to be used from the tenth to the twentieth year. For coughs, pains\r\nof the chest or side, it is to be given at night, if free from fever,\r\nwith wine and honey; but if feverish, with hydromel, to the extent of an\r\nEgyptian bean. In all cases of hæmoptysis, it is to be given morning and\r\nevening, to the size of an Egyptian bean; if recent, in oxycrate; or, if\r\nchronic, in the decoction of comfrey. In cases of flatulence, tormina, or\r\ncæliac affections, it is to be taken in the morning, to the size of an\r\nEgyptian bean, in hot water. It excites an intense appetite, and removes\r\nrigors, coldness, and vomiting of bile when drunk before the attack. It\r\npromotes menstruation, and expels the fœtus when dead, if drunk to the\r\nsize of an Egyptian nut with honeyed water, or sweet wine, in which rue\r\nor dittany has been boiled. In the case of loss of voice, it is drunk\r\nalone, and with double the quantity of tragacanth in wine and honey, or\r\nsweet wine, being retained under the tongue and allowed to melt. For\r\ndiseases of the spleen or liver, it is given with oxycrate; but if they\r\nare in a scirrhous state, with a cyathus and a half of oxymel, or vinegar\r\nof squills. For nephritic complaints, it is given with oxymel to the\r\nsize of an Egyptian bean. In dysenteric cases it is given to the same\r\namount, with the decoction of sumach, morning and evening. For dimness\r\nof vision it answers excellently thus: Mix oz. ij of the antidote, and\r\nof opobalsam, with one cyathus of honey, and after a little anoint with\r\nit. It is also used as a dentifrice. Many, for the sake of prophylaxis,\r\ntake it at new moon to the size of a Grecian bean, after digestion, with\r\na cochleare of honey and two cyathi of water. In like manner they use it\r\nwhen upon a journey they suspect that the air or water is bad.\r\n\r\n_Theriac salts._ Take four female vipers recently caught; and then\r\nputting into a mortar one Italian modius of ammoniac or common salt,\r\npound into thick pieces, along with it, of gentian, lb. iss; of round\r\nbirthwort, lb. iss; of the hair of the small centaury, lb. ij; of\r\ncardamom, of horehound, of each, oz. vj; of water germander, of parsley,\r\nof Cretan germander, of each, lb. j; of the seed of garden rue, sext.\r\nij: unite these with a sufficient quantity of Attic honey, and throwing\r\nthe half of them into a new pot, and then the four vipers alive, add\r\nto them fresh tender squills, cut into small pieces, and then join to\r\nthem the remaining half of the mixture formerly mentioned. Then having\r\ncovered up the pot carefully, make three or four perforations in its lid\r\nto allow the vapour to escape, that it may indicate to you the progress\r\nof the operation of roasting. At first much smoke will be seen issuing,\r\nfuliginous and very turbid, indicating that the fire is acting upon the\r\nanimals. You must then take care lest you inhale any of this smoke, which\r\nis infected with the exhalation from the vipers. When this vapour has\r\nceased, you may see a fine flame issuing through the holes, by which you\r\nmay know that they are properly roasted. Then having removed the pot from\r\nthe fire, and allowed it to cool for a whole day and night, take out the\r\nashes, pound them carefully, and sift them along with these mixtures: of\r\nthe seed of wild rue, of Cretan hyssop, of each, oz. ix; of the seed of\r\nfennel, of Celtic nard, of Scythian base horehound, of each, oz. vj; of\r\nMacedonian stone-parsley, of Indian leaf, of each, oz. iv; of amomum, of\r\ngrapes, of the seed of horminum toasted, of each, oz. iij; of the shoots\r\nof marjoram, of the shoots of thyme, of each, oz. ij; of juniper berries,\r\nof white and of long pepper, of each, lb. j; of the root of laserwort,\r\noz. x; of coriander seed, of ginger not perforated, of the seed or root\r\nof satyrium, of pennyroyal, of the seseli of Marseilles, of mint, of\r\neach, oz. vj; of cassia fistula, oz. ij; of cinnamon, oz. j. I, however,\r\nhave made the preparation, so that I did not burn the animals, but mixed\r\nthe trochisks from them, as related under the theriac, with those things\r\nwhich are burnt along with the vipers, that the bitterness which they\r\nhave in them may be laid aside during the burning. I added just such a\r\nproportion of the trochisks as I conjectured to agree with the contents\r\nof the four vipers. And truly in this way they turned out excellent.\r\n\r\n_The Mithridatic antidote from scinks._ Of troglodytic myrrh, of\r\nginger, of cinnamon, of each, dr. x; of spikenard, of frankincense, of\r\nshepherd’s pouch, of opobalsam, of schœnanth, of costus, of cassidony,\r\nof seseli, of galbanum, of turpentine, of long pepper, of castor, of\r\nhypocistis juice, of storax, of the leaves of malabathrum, of each, dr.\r\niv; of black cassia, of poley, of white pepper, of water germander, of\r\ncarrot-seed, of carpobalsam, of cyphi, of bdellium, of Celtic nard, of\r\ngum, of stone-parsley, of opium, of cardamom, of the seeds of fennel,\r\nof gentian, of rose-leaves, of each, dr. viij; of dittany, of anise,\r\nof sweet flag, of valerian, of each, dr. iij; of Athamantic spignel,\r\nof acacia, of the belly of a scink, of the seed of St. John’s wort, of\r\neach, dr. iss; of wine and honey, q. s. Prepare it in like manner as the\r\ntheriac. Galen says, that it applies to the same cases as the theriac,\r\nwith the exception of those who have been bitten by the viper, for there\r\nthe theriac is more efficacious.\r\n\r\n_The antidote from different kinds of blood being a remedy against all\r\nvenomous animals and deadly poisons._ Of white and long pepper, of\r\ncostus, of sweet flag, of valerian, of anise, of Cretan dittany, of each,\r\ndr. ij; of amomum, of opobalsam, of the seed of wild rue, of the seed of\r\nfennel, of Ethiopian cumin, of dill, of the dried blood of a male duck,\r\nof the blood of a kid, of the blood of a goose, of the blood of a female\r\nduck, of the seed of the wild rape, of each, dr. iij; of gentian root, of\r\ntrefoil, of the schœnanth, of frankincense, of dried roses, of each, dr.\r\niv; of cinnamon, dr. ij; of water germander, dr. viij; of stone-parsley,\r\nof poley, of myrrh, of nard, of each, dr. vj; of cassia, dr. iij; of\r\nCyrenaic juice, dr. iij; of cassidony, dr. v; of asarabacca, dr. ij; of\r\nammoniac perfume, dr. iij; of Athamantic spignel, dr. ij; of agaric, dr.\r\nij; of carpobalsam, gr. xx; of boiled honey, q. s.\r\n\r\n_Simple oxymel._ Of the most acrid white vinegar, sextar. j; of water,\r\nsextar. ij; of honey, sextar. j; boil to the consistence of the most\r\nliquid honey, despumating the honey.\r\n\r\n_The vinegar of squills._ Of white squills cut into pieces, dried in\r\nthe shade for forty days, and again cleaned, one mina; of good vinegar,\r\nsextar. xij. Put them into a vessel, cover it up, and allow to remain in\r\nthe sun for sixty days; after which the squill is to be expressed and\r\nthrown away, and the strained vinegar laid up in a vessel. Some add one\r\nmina of squills to sextar. vj; others add the same quantity of green\r\nsquills to the vinegar, and allow them to remain in the vessel six\r\nmonths; and it becomes more penetrative. It is applicable for defluxions\r\nof the mouth, as a gargle, and when drunk, for many internal affections,\r\nexcepting when there is ulceration, and for many other purposes.\r\n\r\n_The oxymel of squills._ Of the internal tender parts of squills,\r\nlb. ij; of strong white vinegar, sext. xv; of pepper, of Macedonian\r\nstone-parsley, of each, dr. ij; of Cretan carrot, of bishop’s weed,\r\nof anise, of Celtic nard, of lovage, of asarabacca, of cardamom, of\r\nspikenard, of amomum, of rha Ponticum, of each, oz. ss; of the seed\r\nof fennel, of cumin, of laserwort, of ginger, of pellitory, of Cretan\r\nhyssop, of costus, of pennyroyal, of each, oz. j; of green mint, one\r\nfasciculus; of green rue, five branches; of Attic honey, one sextarius;\r\nof rob, sext. ij; of green parsley, one fasciculus. Put the white inner\r\nparts of the squills bruised into the vinegar, and allow it to macerate\r\nseven days during the heat of the dog-days: then taking out the squills,\r\nwhich, if dried, are to be pounded, but if green, not pounded, add to the\r\nvinegar, and again, after seven days, having strained all, add the honey\r\nand rob to the vinegar, and having boiled to a proper consistence, lay\r\nthem up in a glass vessel. This remedy is to be taken as a potion before\r\nfood, or along with food for a sauce. It is much used.\r\n\r\n_Galen’s medicine from squills, answering particularly with epileptics._\r\nHaving broken down squills with your hands into small pieces, put into\r\na vessel used for containing honey, and having covered it up properly,\r\nput it in a place exposed to the midday during the heat of the dog-star;\r\nforty days after the rising of the dog-star loose it, and you will find\r\nthat the body of the squill is melted down. Taking, then, its juice,\r\nsweeten it with some very fine honey, and give every day a spoonful of\r\nit, if to children, a small one, but if to adults, a large one. But\r\ntriturate the body of the squill itself with honey and give a spoonful of\r\nit. It is inferior in power to the juice.\r\n\r\n_The antidote of Philo._ Of white pepper, dr. xx; of hyoscyamus, dr.\r\nxx; of the juice of poppies, dr. x; of saffron, dr. v; of pellitory, of\r\neuphorbium, of spikenard, of each dr. j; of Attic or any other fine,\r\nwell-boiled honey, q. s.

Give it in those cases which, along with a mitigation\r\nof pain and the production of sleep, require purgative and detergent\r\nmedicines, for the parts within the thorax, or about the lungs and\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\n_The compound antidote from poppy-heads._ Take of the water in which\r\npoppy-heads have been boiled, according to the above-mentioned\r\nproportion, sext. j; of sweet wine, two heminæ; of honey, lb. j; of\r\nsaffron, of the juice of hypocistis, of each, dr. iv; boil to a proper\r\nconsistence. That which is prepared from honey, poppy-heads, and quinces\r\nis more grateful to the stomach. It becomes more efficacious if along\r\nwith the poppy-heads some melilot and liquorice be also boiled in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_A simple linctus or lohock from horehound, principally for\r\nconsumptions._ Boil a pound of the hair of horehound in six heminæ of\r\nwater until but a third remain; then throw away the herb, and adding to\r\nthe water an equal quantity of honey, boil to the consistence of honey,\r\nand give one cochleare (spoonful).\r\n\r\n_A compound lohock from horehound._ Of the hairy parts of horehound, of\r\nIllyrian iris, of hyssop, of pennyroyal, of liquorice, of parsley, of\r\neach, oz. ij; of fatty dried figs, oz iij; of the kernels of the pine\r\ncontaining rosin, oz. iij; bruise the dry things into large pieces, and\r\nmacerate with the figs in sextar. iij of water, and boil to a third part.\r\nThen having strained the water, add of honey, lb. ij, and boil to the\r\nconsistence of honey.\r\n\r\n_The lohock from tares._ Of bitter almonds, oz. ij; of the flour of\r\ntares, oz. iv; of hyssop, oz. iv; of iris, oz. ss; of toasted pine-nuts,\r\noz. ij; of honey, sextar. j, or q. s.\r\n\r\n_The lohock called Dodecatheon._ Of Illyrian iris, oz. iv; of tares, oz.\r\niv; of hyssop, oz. ij; of nettle-seed, oz. ij; of liquorice, oz. ij; of\r\nfenugreek, oz. ij; of the bulbi, oz. iv; of toasted linseed, oz. iv; of\r\ngith, scr. xviij; of pennyroyal, scr. viij; of toasted pine-nuts, oz. ij;\r\nof pepper, scr. vj; of honey, q. s.\r\n\r\n_The antidote Sotira._ Of spikenard, scr. xxxix; of myrrh, scr. xxvij;\r\nof saffron, scr. xxxvij; of castor, scr. xxxix; of opium, scr. xxxvj; of\r\nstone-parsley, scr. xlv; of anise, scr. ix; of parsley, scr. vij; of the\r\nschœnanth, scr. xxxvj; of cassia, scr. xij; of long pepper, scr. xij; of\r\nthe seed of sinon, scr. vj; of storax, scr. xviij; of amomum, scr. xij;\r\nof seseli, scr. xij; of hedychroum, scr. xviij; of costus, scr. xviij; of\r\nasarabacca, scr. xviij; of honey, q. s.\r\n\r\n_The cough medicine from storax._ Of amomum, of cassia, of each, oz. ij;\r\nof storax, of spikenard, of each, oz. iss; of saffron, of white pepper,\r\nof each oz. j; of honey, sext. j; give a spoonful.\r\n\r\n_The medicine of Philoxenus for empyema and chronic defluxions._ Of\r\nturpentine, dr. xxviij; of nard, dr. xvj; of the oil of myrrh, dr. vj;\r\nof cardamom, of the bulbi, dr. vj; of saffron, dr. xij; of galbanum, dr.\r\nxvj; bitter almonds, lxxx; of honey, a hemina.

Celsus thus defines the nature of antidotes: “Antidota\r\nraro, sed præcipue interdum necessaria sunt, quia gravisismis casibus\r\nopitulantur. Ea recte quidem dantur collisis corporibus vel per\r\nictus, vel ubi ex alto deciderunt, vel in viscerum, laterum, faucium,\r\ninteriorumque partium doloribus; maxime autem desideranda sunt adversus\r\nvenena, vel per morsus, vel per cibos, aut potiones nostris corporibus\r\ninserta.” He gives prescriptions for three antidotes. They consist\r\nprincipally of stimulant and aromatic medicines, mixed with honey and\r\nwine. (v, 23.)\r\n\r\nMost of the antidotes treated of in this chapter are copied from Galen’s\r\nwork ‘De Antidotis,’ but our author, in many instances, has used the\r\nliberty to introduce various alterations, either with the view of\r\nsimplifying or improving upon the formulæ of Galen. Mesue also treats\r\nfully of antidotes in his work, ‘De Electariis,’ wherein he substitutes\r\na considerable number of Arabic articles for those used by the Greeks.\r\nSerapion describes these compositions with extreme prolixity. (Tract.\r\nvii.) But what shall we say of Myrepsus, who gives prescriptions for\r\n511 antidotes? Of these, and such like multifarious compositions, it\r\nwould be idle to attempt any general analysis, and therefore we shall\r\npass by all the articles treated of in this chapter unnoticed, with\r\nthe exception of the _Theriac_, which was so celebrated in the records\r\nof ancient medicine, that we think ourselves called upon to give some\r\nfurther account of it. Galen devotes two distinct treatises to the\r\nconsideration of the celebrated theriac from vipers, besides giving a\r\ngeneral description of it in his work on antidotes. Our author’s account\r\nof it is merely an abridgment of his. Galen mentions that Mithridates,\r\nking of Pontus, had, by repeated experiments upon condemned malefactors,\r\nacquired a most thorough knowledge of the proper antidotes for almost\r\nevery venomous reptile and poisonous substance, and hence he constructed\r\nthe composition bearing his name, which was long esteemed as a general\r\nantidote to deleterious substances. From it Andromachus, the chief\r\nphysician to the emperor Nero, formed his famous theriac, having added\r\nthe flesh of vipers, and otherwise altered some of the ingredients in\r\nthe theriac of Mithridates. The prescription for it was translated into\r\nverse by Damocrates, and the poem, consisting of 174 lines, is preserved\r\nin Galen’s work, ‘De Antidotis.’ As stated by Galen, it was composed\r\nof inspissated juices, liquid juices, barks, roots, flowers, seeds, and\r\nfleshes. Of the vegetable substances which entered into the composition\r\nof it, it is difficult to remark any one general character, although\r\none can have no difficulty in perceiving that by far the greater number\r\nof them are hot, volatile stimulants, which, agreeably to the ancient\r\nviews of practice, as explained by us in the Fifth Book, were supposed\r\nto counteract the frigidity of poisons. It was, no doubt, with the same\r\nintention that Andromachus added the flesh of vipers, from which, as\r\na modern author, Moses Charras, remarks, a volatile salt and oil are\r\nprocured. In preparing the vipers, Galen directs us to cut off the head\r\nand tail to the extent of four fingers’ breadth, and then to take out\r\ntheir entrails and fat, and boil them until the backbone be separated\r\nfrom the flesh, when the latter is to be taken out and formed into\r\ntrochisks, with crumb of bread. We need not occupy time with detailing\r\nall the other steps in the formation of this multifarious composition,\r\nas our author’s account is sufficiently ample and accurate. Galen\r\nexpresses great confidence in it, especially as an antidote to poisons,\r\nand a remedy for inveterate diseases of the skin, such as leprosy and\r\nelephantiasis. It derives its name, he says, either from its being used\r\nas a remedy for the stings of venomous animals (θήρια), or because the\r\nflesh of such a reptile, namely, the viper, entered into the composition\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe Greek authorities subsequent to Galen repeat his directions for\r\nforming this celebrated medicine, and any alterations which they make in\r\nit are not very important. The Rheum barbarum instead of the Rhâ Ponticum\r\nappears in the prescription given by Myrepsus. Like his predecessors,\r\nhe praises the theriac not only as an antidote to poisons, but as a\r\npreservative from pestilential diseases. Actuarius, who describes it very\r\naccurately, pronounces it to be the best of all the antidotes.\r\n\r\nAverrhoes’s treatise on the theriac is interesting and worth consulting,\r\nalthough his views are upon the whole much in accordance with those of\r\nGalen. He seems to have referred its action as a medicine to its power in\r\nrousing the vital heat of the system; and hence he very properly forbids\r\nit to be administered in all cases of an inflammatory and bilious nature.\r\nHe therefore condemns the use of it in pleurisy unless when the pain is\r\ndull and chronic. He says, it ought not to be given in cases of difficult\r\nparturition, unless when it is wished to rouse the expulsive faculty, or\r\nwhen the fœtus is dead. According to his account, the composition has\r\nnot arrived at perfection, when it is four years old, and it retains its\r\npowers until after forty years.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas sums up the medicinal properties of the theriac with stating\r\nthat it dries the natural humidity, strengthens the viscera, cleanses the\r\norgans of food and respiration, and expels superfluities from the brain.\r\nHence he pronounces it to be a remedy for all the diseases which attack\r\nthe human body. (Pract. x, 4.)\r\n\r\nSerapion describes the following methods of trying whether the theriac be\r\ngood: 1st. Give of it to the amount of a drachm to a person who has taken\r\na powerful emetic or cathartic, such as white hellebore or scammony, and\r\nif it counteract the effect of the medicine that has been taken, we know\r\nthat it is genuine. 2d. As Galen directs, having got a wild cock, allow\r\nit to be stung by a venomous reptile, and then give it a proper dose of\r\nthe theriac. If the fowl escape unhurt we are sure that the medicine\r\nis good; but if he die we know that it is not to be depended upon. 3d.\r\nGive a poisonous substance, such as opium, to a cock or a dog, and then\r\nadminister the theriac, the powers of which may be judged of from the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nMoses Charras, who published ‘The Royal Pharmacopœia’ about the end\r\nof the seventeenth century, thus enumerates the medicinal uses of the\r\ntheriac of Andromachus: “Treacle being composed of a great quantity\r\nof hot medicaments, ought to be very much esteemed for the cure of\r\ncold diseases, and of all those where the natural heat is feeble and\r\nlanguishing, especially, among the rest, of palsies, epilepsies,\r\nconvulsions, and all cold diseases of the head. It is proper against all\r\nweaknesses and want of retention in the stomach and intestines; against\r\nthe diarrhœa, dysentery, lientery, morbus cholera, and all sort of\r\ncolics; against agues, and particularly the quartan; against the worms;\r\nagainst all sorts of poison, the pestilence, smallpox, the measles, and\r\nall epidemic diseases; against the biting of mad dogs and all sorts of\r\nvenomous animals; against want of sleep, and griping pains in children;\r\nagainst hysteric passions, the jaundice, and an infinite sort of other\r\ndiseases.” (P. i, c. 20.)\r\n\r\nThis famous medicine was expelled from the ‘British Pharmacopœia’ about\r\nthe middle of the last century. When its rejection was proposed by Dr.\r\nHeberden, the College divided upon the question, and there were found\r\nto be 13 votes for retaining, and 14 for rejecting it. Its medicinal\r\nvirtues had been previously questioned by Capivaccius, Trincavallius,\r\nand Julius Alexandrinus. It is still retained, however, in the ‘Codex\r\nMedicamentarius’ of Paris; and, we understand, is much used by the Greek\r\nphysicians in Constantinople. A formula for a theriac is contained in\r\nthe Greek Pharmacopœia of the present day. Although it still retains the\r\nname of “Theriaca Andromachi,” it consists of but a very small number\r\nof ingredients in comparison with the original preparation. Dr. Mead\r\nsays of it, “The physicians in Italy and France very commonly prescribe\r\nthe broth and jelly of viper’s flesh to invigorate and purify the mass\r\nof blood exhausted with diseases or tainted with some vicious and\r\nobstinate ferment.” (On Poisons.) Upon the virtues of viper’s flesh,\r\nDuemerbroeck expresses himself in the following terms: “Carnes viperinas\r\nac serpentinas adversus multa venena eximiam antidotalem vim obtinere\r\nadeo notum est ut absolutè negari non possit, idque non tantum liquet ex\r\nGaleni testimoniis verum etiam ex quotidianâ experientiâ. Sic Hartmannus\r\nscribit se propriis oculis vidisse, a quodam experto medico tribus diebus\r\ncontinuis intra corpus gravissima quædam venena assumpta eademque paulo\r\npost sine ullâ noxâ, ab exhibito pulvere cum astantium admiratione iterum\r\nexpulsa fuisse.” (De Peste, iii, 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.—ON TROCHISKS, OR TROCHES.\r\n\r\nTrochisks are so named from their form. There are three kinds of them.\r\nFor some of them are to be swallowed, some injected, and some rubbed in.\r\nOf those which are swallowed, some are for restraining the belly, or a\r\nflow of blood, or any other discharge, by their cooling, astringent,\r\nobstruent, or desiccative qualities, such as that from Egyptian thorn,\r\nthat from seeds, and the like. Some are anodyne, either by deadening\r\nthe sensibility, such as the saffron, or by dispelling, like those from\r\naromatic substances. Some act as deobstruents on the spleen, kidneys,\r\nand liver, such as that from bitter almonds. Of those which are injected,\r\nsome are for blunting acrimony, as in dysentery, such as those from\r\npompholyx, starch, and Samian earth, injected with the juice of ptisan,\r\nor the like. Some act as astringents upon the alvine discharges, or a\r\nflow of blood, as those from alum, acacia, and omphacium, such as that\r\nof Philip; or that consisting of Egyptian thorn, injected with the juice\r\nof roses or of plantain. Those that are caustic agree with spreading\r\ndysenteries, being composed of sandarach, arsenic, quicklime, and burnt\r\npepper; but they are to be injected with the juice of lentils or of\r\nrice, the intestine being first washed out with salt water, and the\r\npatients having eaten and drunk beforehand, so that none of the powers\r\nof the medicine may be carried up to the stomach. Those trochisks which\r\nare injected prove serviceable principally in affections below the\r\nnavel, for their power does not reach higher up. Those which are rubbed\r\nin are possessed of similar powers to those which are injected. But\r\nthe astringent ones are applicable in herpes, exanthemata, intertrigo,\r\nhemorrhage, and ulcers attended with discharges, such as that of Andron\r\nand that of Polyides. Those possessed of blunting powers agree with\r\ncarbuncle, and ill-conditioned ulcers, such as the white trochisks, and\r\nthat from lotaria. Those which burn as those mentioned above, like the\r\nFaustian, are applicable in spreading ulcers in the pudenda and anus, and\r\nfor pterygia and sarcomata.\r\n\r\n_The trochisk aster._ Of saffron, of castor, of spikenard, of cassia,\r\nof myrrh, of Lemnian earth, of the bark of mandragora, of each, oz. iv;\r\nof carrot, of parsley, of anise, of seseli, of the seed of henbane, of\r\nstorax, of each, dr. viij.

Celsus informs us that they are the same as the _pastilli_\r\nof the Latins. He thus describes their general properties: “Pastilli\r\nhæc ratio est: arida medicamenta contrita humore non pingui, ut vino\r\nvel aceto, coguntur, et rursus coacta inarescunt, atque, ubi utendum\r\nest, ejusdem generis humore diluuntur.” He gives prescriptions for six\r\ntrochisks. (v, 20.)\r\n\r\nGalen remarks that trochisks derive their name from their spherical\r\nshape. He treats of them at great length in the fifth book of his work\r\n‘De Comp. Med. sec. gen.’ Many of our author’s receipts are copied from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the Arabian trochisks, see in particular Serapion\r\n(vii, 18); Haly Abbas (Pract. x, 14); and Mesue (i, 8.) The following is\r\nMesue’s formula for the trochisks of camphor: “The trochisks of camphor,\r\nfor ardent fevers, heat of the blood and bile, warm intemperament of the\r\nliver, insatiable thirst, jaundice, consumption, and hectics.—℞ Of rose\r\nleaves dr. iv; of spodium, of liquorice āā, dr. ij; of yellow saunders,\r\ndr. iiss; of the seeds of citrons, melons, cucumbers, and gourds, of\r\nsaffron, of tragacanth, of gum, of spikenard, āā dr. j; of lignum aloes,\r\nof cardomum, of starch, of camphor, āā dr. j; of white sugar, of manna,\r\nāā dr. iij. Mix with the mucilage of fleawort and water of roses.”\r\nMyrepsus’s formula for the same is little different. He describes the\r\ncomposition of 136 pastils.\r\n\r\nMoses Charras gives the following account of trochisks: “They are also\r\ncalled pastils, rolls, cakes, and lozenges. Trochisks were invented as\r\nwell to preserve a long time the virtue of certain medicaments as to\r\nunite together the virtue of several. To which purpose having finely\r\npowdered the ingredients, which are to be powdered, they are to be\r\nincorporated with some juice, syrup, or other viscous liquor, to make\r\ntherewith a solid paste, out of which are formed little trochisks, flat,\r\nround, triangular, square, long, or otherwise, which being spread upon\r\npaper, and dried out of the sun, and at a distance from the fire, to the\r\nend they may be dried in all parts alike, may be put up in boxes or pots\r\nfor use.” (Royal Phar. ii, 21.)\r\n\r\nTroches are pharmaceutical preparations still frequently used. According\r\nto the directions in the ‘Edinburgh Dispensatory,’ “they are composed\r\nof powders made up with glutinous substances into small cakes, and\r\nafterwards dried.” There is this difference, however, between the troches\r\nof the moderns and the trochisci of the ancients, that all the former\r\nare given internally, whereas many of the ancient trochisci were used\r\nas external applications. Of this description are five out of the six\r\npastilli described by Celsus. Le Clerc says of them: “Ils differoient des\r\nemplâtres, et des collyres, en ce qu’il n’entroit aucune matière huileuse\r\ndans les trochisques et qu’ils servoient pour le dedans aussi bien que\r\npour le dehors.” (Hist. de la Méd.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.—DRY APPLICATIONS AND ABSTERGENTS (SMEGMATA.)\r\n\r\nOf dry applications or powders, some suit with ulcers, and some are\r\napplied to the skin. Of those which suit with ulcers, some act as\r\nincarnants of hollow ulcers, and some restrain fungous flesh, and\r\nsome are cicatrizing, some caustic and septic, and some styptic. The\r\nincarnative applications act either by cleansing foul ulcers, such as\r\nthose from tares, birthwort, iris, all-heal, myrrh, frankincense, and\r\naloes; or by drying the superabundant discharge, as those from copper,\r\ndiphryges, squama æris, burnt paper, the bark of pine and thorn. But\r\nthese promote cicatrization, either by blunting acrimony and pungency,\r\nsuch as those from pompholyx, starch, ceruse, sphecla (impure potass),\r\nthe lapis specularis, burnt oysters, terra Samia, and the like, and the\r\ncompositions from them possess similar powers. Of repressing medicines,\r\nsome are mild, such as those from squama æris, those from misy and\r\nchalcitis, when burnt, and galls; but those from copperas, verdigris,\r\nmisy, and chalcitis, not burnt, are stronger. The caustics and septics\r\nare prepared from quicklime, arsenic, sandarach, and sphecla, which is\r\nthe burnt lees of wine. All these things when reduced to a fine powder\r\nand sprinkled upon ulcers, are less pungent. The coarser the powder to\r\nwhich they are reduced, the more pungent are they. Styptics restrain\r\nbleeding, either by astringing or cooling, or proving desiccative or\r\nobstruent by burning and forming an eschar; and the materials of them\r\nhave been mentioned in the section on Trochisks. Of those which are\r\napplied to the skin, some cleanse and absterge, such as those from\r\nCimolian earth, pumice, bean-meal, barley-leaven, the flesh of pompions,\r\nand the flower of salt; some are attenuant and discutient, such as those\r\nfrom hellebore, alcyonium, sulphur, stavesacre, mustard, pellitory,\r\nthe seed of the rosemary, lemnitis, or adarce, and the shell of the\r\ncuttle-fish. But those having quicklime and arsenic added to them, with\r\nsome liquid, become depilatory and abstergent. Some are applied to the\r\nhead in order to dry up the discharge from it, such as those from natron,\r\nsalts, galls, the rind of pomegranate, and the like. All the smegmata\r\n_or_ abstergents should be applied to the skin when it is not anointed.\r\n\r\n_The dry cephalic application._ Of tares, oz. v; of iris, oz. iss; of\r\nmanna, oz. iss; of birthwort, of squama æris, of each, oz. iss.\r\n\r\n_Another._ Of the bark of pine, dr. vj; of frankincense, dr. iv;\r\nof pumice-stone, dr. iv; of iris, dr. ij; of dry rosin, dr. vj; of\r\nbirthwort, dr. ij.\r\n\r\n_From aloes._ Of aloes, dr. vj; of tares, dr. viij; of manna, dr. iv; of\r\ngalls, dr. iij; of fissile alum, dr. ij.\r\n\r\n_The dry application of Manetho from the burnt lees of wine._ Of\r\ncalamine, burnt and washed, oz. j; of terra aster, oz. j; of burnt lees\r\nof wine, oz. iv; of lapis specularis, oz. iv; of frankincense, oz. iv;\r\nsome add, also, of starch, oz. iv.\r\n\r\n_The melitera of Oribasius._ Of chalcitis, of squama æris, of galls, of\r\nthe flowers of the wild pomegranate, of long birthwort, of each, oz. j;\r\nof pomegranate rind, of fissile alum, of each, oz. ss.\r\n\r\n_From oysters._ Of calamine, of frankincense, of each, oz. j; of oysters\r\nburnt, oz. iij.\r\n\r\n_The powder from frankincense._ Of litharge, of frankincense, of\r\ncalamine, of ceruse, equal parts.\r\n\r\n_The powder called aphroditarium._ Of frankincense, of squama æris, of\r\nrhœdarium (a preparation from sumach), of starch, of ceruse, equal parts.\r\n\r\n_The Rhodian styptic for spreading ulcers and fungous flesh._ Of unripe\r\ngalls, dr. vj; of galls burnt, and extinguished in wine and dried,\r\ndr. xij; of the black squama æris, or, if not, of the red, dr. viij;\r\nof copperas, dr. xxiv; of fissile alum, dr. xxvij; triturate for a\r\nsufficient number of days.\r\n\r\n_The powder called flavus._ Of burnt chalcitis, dr. xl; of burnt\r\ncopperas, dr. viij; of burnt misy, dr. x; of burnt copper, dr. v.\r\n\r\n_The powder called psarus._ Of misy, oz. v; of galls, oz. iv; of\r\nchalcitis, oz. ij; of squama æris, oz. ij; of copperas, oz. j; of scraped\r\nverdigris, oz. ij.\r\n\r\n_The caustic powder called heliocaes._ Of arsenic, lb. j; of calx viva,\r\nlb. ij.

The terms are thus explained by Blancard: “_Diapasma._\r\nPlinio, medicamentum aridum ex siccis pulveribus conflatum inspersile,\r\nquod aut vestibus ad gratiam odoris, aut ulceri vulnerique variâ ratione,\r\naut potui etiam ad luxum inspergitur, διάπασμα, κατάπασμα, κατάπαστον\r\nφάρμακον. Oribasius non malè discrimen inter has voces ex Antyllo ponere\r\nmihi videtur ut ἐμπάσματα sint, quæ sudoribus cohibendis, et commovendo\r\npruritui adhibentur: quæ _Sympasmata et aspergines_ Aurelianus nominat:\r\nκαταπάσματα sunt quæ ulceribus superponuntur, ξήρια etiam dicta:\r\nδιαπάσματα vero conciliandæ in vento fragrantiæ.” (Lexicon Medicum.) The\r\ndifferent forms of medicines are thus characterized by Dr. Blomfield:\r\n“Quatuor sunt φαρμάκων genera, quorum principuè mentio fit apud auctores\r\nGræcos: φάρμακα χριστὰ, παστὰ, πλαστὰ, et πιστὰ vel πότιμα, quibus\r\ninterdum additur quintum genus, τὰ βρώσίμα, et sextum ἐπωδὰι, prout eis\r\nad _unguendum_, _inspergendum_, _emplastro obtegendum_, _bibendum_,\r\n_edendum_, vel _incantandum_ utebantur.” (Glossarium ad Æschyli Prometh.\r\nl. 488.) Theocritus uses the word ἐπίπαστον in its medical sense. (Idyll.\r\nxi, 2.) He says, no medicine, either in the form of ointment or powder,\r\nis a remedy for love. Le Clerc thus explains the medicines of which we\r\nare treating: “Les _poudres_ s’appelloient en Grec ξήρια ὀυ ξηρὰ c’est à\r\ndire, _médicamens secs_. On les appelloit _Diapasmata_, _Catapasmata_,\r\n_Catapasta_, _Sympasmata_.” He says of the Smegma: “On s’en servoit\r\nparticulièrement pour nettoyer le peau, pour ôter le démangeaison, &c.”\r\nHe adds: “Lorsque il s’agissoit de faire tomber le poil on prenoit des\r\nmatières encore plus fortes et plus acres que celles qu’on a indiquées,\r\ncomme de l’orpiment, de la sandaraque, de la chaux vive, et l’on les\r\ndétrempoit avec les sucs. En ces cas on donnoit à cette composition le\r\nnom particulière de _psilothrum_ ou _dépilatoire_.” (Hist. de la Méd.)\r\nOn the meaning of the terms see, further, Eustathius (ap. Iliad, iv);\r\nScholiast. Aristoph. (Plaat); and Gataker’s Antoninus (v, 9.)\r\n\r\nCelsus gives the following general description of these medicines:\r\n“Quædam autem mixturæ medicamentorum sunt quibus aridis neque coactis\r\nutimur, sic ut inspergamus, aut cum aliquo liquido mixta illinamus.” The\r\npowder of gollas, if prepared according to his directions, would consist\r\nof potass, sulphur, quicklime, and orpiment. His ninth preparation of\r\nthis class is a sternutatory, and the tenth is one for making a gargle.\r\n(v, 22.)\r\n\r\nMost of our author’s formulæ are borrowed, with a few alterations, from\r\nGalen. (De Med. sec. gen. v.)\r\n\r\nFor a description of the Arabian _Pulveres_, see, in particular, Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. x, 16,) and Mesue, (i, ix.) Many of Mesue’s compositions\r\nare internal medicines, consisting principally of aromatics. Thus, his\r\nfirst preparation, which is intended to dry humidity of the stomach,\r\ndispel flatulence, and assist digestion, consists of lignum aloes, oz.\r\nss; of galls, dr. iss; and of white sugar, oz. iss.\r\n\r\nNicolaus Myrepsus, in his copious ‘Dispensatory,’ describes the\r\ncomposition of 50 smegmata and 143 pulveres. The far greater number of\r\nthe former are intended as applications to the skin in diseases thereof,\r\nsuch as impetigo, leprosy, itch, and the like. The pulveres consist of\r\napplications to the skin, sternutatories, gargles, and injections. None\r\nof them, we believe, are to be taken inwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIV.—ON LINIMENTS TO THE MOUTH AND THROAT.\r\n\r\nAs much as the coat which lines the mouth is finer and softer than the\r\nskin, such a difference must there be with regard to the applications\r\nmade to the mouth. At the commencement, therefore, of inflammation,\r\nmedicines for repelling the defluxion are required, such as the\r\ndry applications, namely, omphacium, the gall omphacitis, the juice\r\nof sumach and of hypocistis, and alum, the bark of pine and of the\r\nfrankincense-tree, and the flowers of the wild pomegranate tree; and,\r\nin a word, all the astringents, with the exception of those which are\r\nunsavoury and deleterious; and the liquid applications, such as the juice\r\nof the blackberries, both of the brambles and those called mulberries:\r\nalso the juice of the bark of green walnuts and of pomegranates,\r\nmore especially such as are acid, and of quinces and Aminean must.\r\nHoney is mixed at the commencement solely for the preservation of\r\nthe medicines. But when the humour lodges in the part, digestive and\r\nmoderately-repellent articles are to be mixed, such as saffron, myrrh,\r\nand the juice of liquorice. And during the whole time that intervenes\r\nbetween the acme and decline, a compound of both kinds is to be used, I\r\nmean, the repellent and discutient; and at first the repellent are to be\r\nthe prevailing ingredients, but afterwards the discutient. In the decline\r\nwe must use discutients, which have no astringency, such as natron,\r\naphronitrum, origany, hyssop, thyme, calamint, iris, besasa and the like.\r\nThe liquid application then should be rob, that from boiled must, that\r\nfrom dried figs and palm-nuts, and the sweet must itself with honey. When\r\nbut a little of the inflammation remains, we are to mix also some sulphur\r\nvivum. We must first boil the juice with honey, to the consistence of the\r\nmore liquid honey, and then sprinkle the powders finely levigated, and\r\nafterwards boil moderately until the whole are properly united, and then\r\nit is to be laid up in vessels of glass.\r\n\r\n_The simple liniment to the mouth from mulberries._ Of the juice of\r\nmulberries, sext. iij; boil until a third part be consumed, add of honey,\r\nsext. j, and boil to the consistence of honey.\r\n\r\n_The compound one from mulberries._ Of the juice of mulberries, hemin.\r\nvj; boil to the consistence of the sordes in baths, then mix, well\r\ntriturated, of saffron, dr. j; of myrrh, dr. ij; of the juice of unripe\r\ngrape, dr. j; of fissile alum, three oboli; of honey, one hemina; and\r\nboil to a proper thickness.\r\n\r\n_Of the bramble-berries._ The composition from bramble-berries is\r\nprepared in like manner, being more astringent.\r\n\r\n_The simple one from walnuts._ Of the juice of the pounded bark of\r\ngreen walnuts, hemin. v; of honey, hemin. j; it is boiled like that from\r\nmulberries.\r\n\r\n_The compound one from walnuts._ In the commencement, and at the acme of\r\ninflammations in the mouth, mix of saffron and of alum, of each, oz. j;\r\nof myrrh, dr. ij; and in the decline add, as a discutient, of natron, dr.\r\nj; of sulphur, dr. j, to the aforementioned proportions of the juice and\r\nof honey.\r\n\r\n_The preparation from the juice of pomegranates._ Of the juice of sweet\r\npomegranates, without their kernels, sext. iv; of the juice of acid\r\npomegranates, sext. ij; of honey, sext. j; of the Minnæan myrrh, dr.\r\nviij; of crocomagma, of galls, of each, dr. viij; of fissile alum, dr.\r\niv; of Illyrian iris and of omphacium, of each, dr. viij. Prepare like\r\nthat from mulberries.\r\n\r\n_The same otherwise._ Of the juice of sweet pomegranate bruised with\r\ntheir kernels, sext. vj; of fine honey, sext. j; of fissile alum, oz. j;\r\nof myrrh, oz. ss.\r\n\r\n_The preparation from must._ Of must, sext. vj; of galls, of fissile\r\nalum, of each dr. ij; of saffron, of myrrh, of each, dr. j. If you\r\nmean it for a demulcent, let the must be sweet, but if as a repellent,\r\naustere. The middle state has intermediate properties.\r\n\r\n_The Egyptian stomachic._ Of honey, lb. j; of oil, oz. viij; of\r\nturpentine, oz. ij; of saffron, dr. iv. They are melted in a double\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n_The stomachic medicine, from besasa._ Of anise seed, of parsley seed,\r\nof the schœnanth, of the seed of bishop’s weed, of fissile alum, of\r\nIllyrian iris, of besasa (which some call harmala, it is the wild rue),\r\nof cinnamon, of troglodytic myrrh, of saffron, of gall, of each, oz. j;\r\nof long birthwort, of cassia, of crocomagma, of dried roses, of each, oz.\r\nj; of costus, of the fresh ashes of pigeons, oz. iij; of Indian nard, of\r\namomum, of each, oz. ss; of honey, q. s.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. Celsus thus sums up the general properties of these\r\npreparations: “Gargarizationes autem aut lævandi causa fiunt, aut\r\nreprimendi, aut evocandi. Lævant, lac, cremor vel ptisanæ, vel furfurum:\r\nreprimit aqua, in qua vel lenticula, vel rosa, vel rubus, vel cotoneum\r\nmalum, vel palmulæ decoctæ sunt: evocant, sinapi, piper.” (v, 22.)\r\n\r\nGalen treats of these compositions very systematically, and at great\r\nlength, in the sixth book of his work, ‘De Comp. Med. sec. loc.’ The far\r\ngreater number of our author’s prescriptions are copied from it. Myrepsus\r\nlikewise gives a long list of such like compositions (§ ix.) See also\r\nAëtius (viii.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.—ON DELICIOUS AND OFFICINAL POTIONS.\r\n\r\nOf delicious officinal potions, some are composed of wine, having certain\r\narticles added to it, such as pepper, wormwood, sowbread, and many other\r\nthings, from which they sometimes receive their appellation, sometimes\r\nhaving honey mixed with them and sometimes not; and some are composed\r\nfrom water in which have been boiled apples or roses, with certain\r\njuices, such as those of unripe grapes, pomegranates, and myrtles.\r\n\r\nOn this account the finest scummed honey is mixed with them for the sake\r\nof preservation, sweetness, and sometimes of utility. The austere and\r\nvinous hydromel brought from Cebyra in small vessels is an exception;\r\nfor I have known it formed without honey, as the apomel is made from\r\nhoney alone and water, without any other substance. But those things\r\nwhich are prepared from wine, which are called propotions (or “whets”?)\r\nreceive sext. j of scummed honey to four of wine and are made without\r\nbeing boiled. Those which are prepared from water and juices, if boiled,\r\nreceive one part of honey to three of the liquor, about two parts of\r\nwhich are consumed in the boiling; but if they are not boiled they\r\nreceive one part of honey to two of the liquor. Those things which are\r\nnot boiled are to be isolated for a sufficient time, and particularly\r\nthe omphacomel. Those from water require to be boiled, because from\r\ntheir weakness they are readily changed. They are all to be laid up in\r\nsmall pitched earthen vessels, which are to be carefully covered up and\r\ndeposited in situations above ground until they are concocted. They are\r\nto be used as attenuants, and well mixed with water. But the omphacomel\r\nafter being boiled like must, and settling, is to be covered up. Those\r\ncomposed from wine we use principally in cases which are free from fever,\r\nor for the relish only (with the exception of those which are prepared\r\nfrom scammony, the granum Cnidium, or the like purgatives); or in such\r\naffections as when we would use the medicines which are the ingredients\r\nof them by the mouth. Those prepared from water, or the juices we use\r\nin febrile cases, or as sweeteners, when the disease does not admit the\r\nuse of wines, and sometimes as agreeing with the affections, as apomel\r\nfor a sialogogue, diuretic, laxative of the bowels, or attenuant of\r\nhumours; and hydromelon and hydrorosaton in cases of thirst, ardent\r\nfevers, resolutions, and derangements of the stomach; and omphacomel,\r\nmyrteton, rhodostacton, and rhoita, in cæliac and dysenteric cases, and\r\nfor vomitings and other defluxions. They are frequently used as washes in\r\naffections of the mouth.\r\n\r\n_The hydromelum from the juice of apples._ Of the juice of clean quinces\r\nbruised, sext. ij; of honey, sext. iij; of water, sext. vj. Boil,\r\nscumming it until it be reduced to a third part. _Another._—Of clean\r\nquinces cut into pieces, lb. v. Boil in sext. j of well-water until\r\nthey become soft. Then removing them from the fire, after they become\r\ncold, strain, and having filtrated the apples throw them away. Having\r\nmeasured the water, mix with it half the quantity of honey, and boil\r\nagain, scumming it until the eighth part be consumed. Some compose the\r\nhydromelum in like manner from sweet apples.\r\n\r\n_The composition of the hydrorosatum._ Of roses deprived of their nails\r\n(the white parts of the leaves), lb. iv; of water, sext. v; of honey,\r\nsext. ij.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the Rhodomelum._ Of the juice of quinces, sext. j;\r\nof roses, lb. iij; of honey, sext. iij; of water, sext. v. But since the\r\napples are not found at the same season with the roses, these are to be\r\nadded to honey at the proper season, and when the apples appear, the\r\ncomposition is to be completed.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the omphacomel._ Of the juice of unripe grapes, sext.\r\niij; of honey, sext. j. Having mixed, expose it to the sun for forty\r\ndays, or boil.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of Myrteta._ Of the juice of myrtles, sext. iij; of\r\nhoney, sext. j. Boil till the third is consumed.\r\n\r\n_Apomel from the works of Phalagrius._ Of white honeycombs filled with\r\nhoney, lb. j; of spring water, lb. iiiss; having broken down the comb and\r\nunited them, boil the water with the honey until the scum of it and the\r\nwaxy part swim on the top and is separated, then cool and cover it up\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n_The composition of rhodostactum._ Of the juice of roses without their\r\nnails, sext. ij; of honey, sext. j. Boil, scumming it, until the fourth\r\npart be consumed.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of rhætes._ Of the juice of pomegranate, sext. iij; of\r\nhoney, sext. j. Boil to a third part.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. We shall in the first place give some account of the Propoma.\r\nIt was a draught generally containing wine, which was taken at the\r\ncommencement of the supper, or principal meal of the ancients. Horace\r\nalludes to it in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    “Anfidius forti miscebat mella Falerno,\r\n    Mendose: quoniam vacuis committere venis\r\n    Nil nisi lene decet: leni præcordia mulso\r\n    _Prolueris_ melius.”—(Lib. ii, Sat. 4.)\r\n\r\nCatius here condemns the practice of using strong wine for the\r\ncomposition of the Propoma. Old Falernian wine was thought the best. Thus\r\nMacrobius says of it: “Mulsum quo probe temperes, miscendum esse novo\r\nHymetto et Falerno vetulo.” (Saturn. vii, 12.) “To the Propoma,” says\r\nAthenæus, “were added pepper, Indian leaf, myrrh, cyperus, and Egyptian\r\nointment.” (Deip. ii, 25.) A long list of receipts for Propomata is given\r\nby Myrepsus (§ 38.) Most of them contain wine, honey, and aromatics. See\r\na learned Dissertation on the Propoma by Casaubon (in Athen. Deipnos. ii,\r\n17); also Lister (in Apicii Op. i, 1.)\r\n\r\nIt will be proper here to give some account of the medicated wines, or,\r\nas we would now call them, the _Vinous Tinctures_, of the ancients.\r\nDioscorides details the composition of them very fully in the fifth book\r\nof his ‘Materia Medica.’ The following is his prescription for the _wine\r\nof squills_: Take a mina of squills, and having pounded it, sift, and\r\nbind it in a thin piece of linen; then put it into 20 sextarii of good\r\nfresh must, and allow it to macerate for three months; afterwards strain\r\nthe wine into another vessel, and cover it up carefully. The _wine of\r\nquinces_ is to be prepared by putting 12 minæ of quinces, deprived of\r\ntheir seeds, into a cadus of must, and allowing it to remain for thirty\r\ndays. Wines from other kinds of apples, such as medlars, services, and\r\npears, may be prepared in like manner. He afterwards gives similar\r\ndirections for preparing the following medicated wines:\r\n\r\n  Wine of wild vine.\r\n          pomegranate.\r\n          roses.\r\n          myrtles.\r\n          lentisk.\r\n          turpentine.\r\n          palms.\r\n          figs.\r\n          sycamores.\r\n          resin.\r\n          cone of the pine.\r\n          cedar _or_ juniper.\r\n          cedar-rosin.\r\n          pitch.\r\n          wormwood.\r\n          hyssop.\r\n          germander.\r\n          cassidony.\r\n          betony.\r\n          tragoriganum.\r\n          bunium.\r\n          dittany.\r\n          horehound.\r\n          thyme.\r\n          savoury.\r\n          marjoram.\r\n          calamint.\r\n          fleabane.\r\n          aromatics.\r\n          myrrh, pepper, and iris.\r\n          elicampane.\r\n          spikenard.\r\n          asarabacca.\r\n          wild nard _or_ valerian.\r\n          carrot.\r\n          sage.\r\n          panacea.\r\n          sweet-flag.\r\n          parsley.\r\n          fennel and dill.\r\n          hellebore, wild cucumber, or scammony, for procuring abortions.\r\n          spurge-flax.\r\n          mezerion.\r\n          ground-pine.\r\n          mandrake.\r\n          hellebore.\r\n          scammony.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of these factitious wines is also described by Pliny. (H.\r\nN. xiv, 19.) To this class we may refer the _Vina condita_ of Apicius.\r\n(Cap. i.) See also in particular Aëtius (iii); Myrepsus (§ 27); Haly\r\nAbbas (Pract. x, 21); Serapion (vii, 35); Actuarius (Meth. Med. v, 7.)\r\nActuarius gives the following prescription for preparing a _vinous\r\ntincture of poppies_, which he recommends for coughs, cholera, and such\r\nlike complaints: Of poppy-heads, c; of liquorice-root, lb. j; of sodden\r\nmust, lb. c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVI.—ON COLLYRIA AND AGGLUTINATIVE APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe materials from which ophthalmic medicines are composed are various.\r\nFor inspissated and liquid, seeds, fruits, the parts of herbs, and metals\r\nare ingredients in them. Of these, some sooth acrimonies, and are, as it\r\nwere, obstruents, such as pompholyx, spodium, starch, lead, Samian aster,\r\ncalamine, all washed substances, and the white of an egg. These are to\r\nbe used after evacuation of the head, for if there should be plethora\r\nof it, there will be danger of the coats of the eyes being ruptured by\r\ndistension. The opposite class of collyria being of an acrid nature, are\r\ndeobstruents and evacuants of the humours permanently lodged there; such\r\nas the Cyrenaic and Median juices, sagapen, euphorbium, and the like.\r\nSome are detergents of foul ulcers, such as the squama æris, copper,\r\nchalcitis, misy, sori, the flowers of copper, and antimony burnt. Allied\r\nto these are those called abstergents, such as arsenic, sandarach, the\r\nflower of Asian stone. Some are astringent, and of these such as are\r\nmoderately astringent are of extensive use for ophthalmies, ulcers, and\r\ndefluxions, as the leaves, fruit, and flowers of roses, spikenard, Indian\r\nleaf, saffron, glaucium, and hypocistis. Those possessed of a stronger\r\nastringency are mixed with those remedies which are used for sharpening\r\nthe sight, such as omphacium, acacia, the flowers of the wild and of the\r\ncultivated pomegranate, and galls. Some are concoctive and discutient,\r\nsuch as myrrh, saffron, castor, rosemary, and the juice of fenugreek.\r\nOf compound ophthalmic medicines, some are simply called plasta, some\r\nxerocollyria, and some hygrocollyria. The first class admit of all the\r\nmaterials formerly mentioned, and agree with all states. They are to be\r\nprepared most commonly in spring, for in summer their strength is apt\r\nto evaporate, and in winter the articles being constricted do not mix\r\nproperly. They are to be rubbed with the addition of a fluid, but not in\r\ngreat quantity that the metallic parts may not subside, nor the aromatic\r\nfloat on the surface, but in small quantities, so that it may be rubbed\r\nuntil it is like the sordes of baths. Rain-water should be used, because\r\nit is finer and moderately astringent. But if not, those things are\r\nto be levigated and triturated with wine or some juice; the metallic\r\nsubstances for a longer time, and the juicy substances for a shorter.\r\nAt last, after sufficient trituration, we must add the gum, and having\r\nformed them, lay them up in copper vessels especially, or in glass. Those\r\nprepared from juices are to be used immediately, but the metallic improve\r\nby keeping. Of the xerocollyria, some melt down, and absterge callus,\r\nsycosis, pterygium, and scabious affections, being composed of chalcitis,\r\nverdigris, and misy. Some occasion a discharge of tears, agreeing with\r\nobstructions and dimness of sight, and are composed of these things,\r\npepper and spikenard. Some are prophylactics for preventing influxes,\r\nsuch as those from Phrygian stone, sarcocolla, glaucium, aloes, calamine,\r\nantimony, and saffron. All these medicines are to be applied to the eyes\r\nin a state of the finest powder. But the hygrocollyria are prepared\r\nfrom Attic honey, opobalsam, oil of the most subtile kind from age, the\r\njuice of fennel, the galls of different animals, the Cyrenaic juice, and\r\nmany other things. Those things which are attenuant, calefacient, and\r\npurgative are useful for dimness of sight, and incipient suffusions.\r\nThese and all acrid things are to be used when the head is free from\r\nplethora, and when the atmosphere is serene and pure, and the wind is\r\nnortherly, and not very hot nor very cold. Those preparations called\r\nagglutinants are made from such things as are obstruent, agglutinative,\r\nconstringent, refrigerant, styptic, or desiccative, such as pollen,\r\nmanna, Samian earth, myrrh, shells, acacia, opium, with the white of an\r\negg. They are glued to the forehead when the humour is not under the\r\nscalp, but external to it.\r\n\r\n_The collyrium monemeron for incipient and old ophthalmies._ Of acacia,\r\ndr. xxxvj; of gum, dr. xxxij; of calamine, dr. xxiv; of burnt and washed\r\ncopper, dr. viij; of opium, dr. j. Triturate in austere wine. It is\r\ndiscutient and desiccative.\r\n\r\n_The collyrium chiacum._ Of sinopic vermilion, of the immature gall, of\r\nsaffron, of the flower of fresh roses deprived of their nails (which we\r\ncall the pouch), of gum, of each, oz. iv; of opium, oz. j. Triturate with\r\nAminæan, Falernian, or Chian austere wine.

Gorræus derives the word collyrium from κολοβὴ ὀυρὰ, i. e.\r\n_cauda trunca_, being expressive of their conical shape. (Defin. Med.)\r\nBlancard prefers the derivation from κωλύω and ῥοῦς. (Lexicon Medicum.)\r\n\r\nOribasius states that collyria were applied—to the eye, to the uterus,\r\nand to fistulous ulcers. (Med. Coll. x, 23.) It is obvious, therefore,\r\nthat the ancients used the word in a more general signification than\r\nthe moderns do. Le Clerc gives the following description of the ancient\r\ncollyria: “Les uns, qui étoient composés de matières sèches, eurent le\r\nnom de ξηροκολλούρια, _collyres secs_. Les autres, où il n’entroit que\r\ndes matières liquides, s’appellèrent ὑγροκολλούρια, _collyres humides_\r\nou _liquides_. Les ingrediens des premières, qui étoient les mêmes que\r\nceux des collyres _entières_, étoient des poudres _métalliques_, de\r\n_ceruse_, de _pompholyx_, _d’antimoine brulé_, de _vert-de-gris_, de\r\n_chalcitis_, de _cadmia_, et autres semblables. Il y entroit aussi des\r\npoudres tirées des plantes, quelques sucs d’herbes, et quelques gommes,\r\ncomme du _saffran_, des _roses_, du suc de _chelidoine_, et de _fenouil_,\r\nde _l’aloes_, de la _myrrh_, de _l’opium_. On mêloit tous ces ingrédiens\r\net on en formoit des masses que l’on faisait sécher, et dont on faisait\r\nde la poudre lorsqu’on vouloit s’en servir. Les collyres liquides étoient\r\nseulement composés de matières liquides. On prenoit, par exemple, du\r\n_miel d’Attique_, qui étoit estimé le meilleur, de _l’opobalsamum_, avec\r\ndu _fiel de vipre_, de _perdrix_, ou de quelque autre animal, et du _suc\r\nde fenouil_. On faisait de cela un mélange, dont on laissoit tomber\r\nquelques gouttes dans les yeux de ceux qui avoient la vue foible, ou\r\nquelque suffusion commençant.” (Hist. de la Méd. iii, ii, 1.)\r\n\r\nThe Ophthalmic Collyria are treated of with extraordinary accuracy and\r\nminuteness of detail in books iv and v of Galen’s work ‘De comp. med.\r\nsec. locos.’ Notwithstanding the success with which the surgery of the\r\neye has been cultivated of late, we are confident that the oculists of\r\nthe present day might derive still further improvement from an attentive\r\nstudy of these books. It is to be remarked that several of his collyria,\r\nas well as those of Celsus, contain opium, so that the use of the _vinum\r\nopii_ in modern practice is not an original invention. Many of them\r\ncontain very powerful escharotics, such as copper and arsenic, which\r\nindicates a great degree of boldness in ancient practice. Why is arsenic\r\nnever used now for the cure of complaints of the eye? Our author’s\r\naccount of them, which is mostly taken from Galen, is very accurate and\r\ndeserving of consideration.\r\n\r\nAll the collyria of Celsus are ocular remedies. As he states, they\r\nconsist principally of soothing and refreshing medicines variously mixed.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus describes fully the composition of collyria, which he\r\ndivides into the soothing and the acrid. The former consist of saffron,\r\ngum, tragacanth, calamine, antimony, opium and the like. The latter\r\ncontain such ingredients as these, burnt copper, verdigris, chalcitis,\r\nmisy, alum, ammoniac, and galls.\r\n\r\nMyrepsus gives prescriptions for 87 ocular collyria, of every possible\r\nvariety of character.\r\n\r\nFor the Arabian collyria, see particularly Serapion. (De Antidot. vii,\r\n34.) Camphor is an ingredient in many of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVII.—ON PLASTERS, AND THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE ADDED TO THE BOILING\r\nOF THEM, FROM THE WORKS OF ANTYLUS, AND,\r\n\r\n_On the proportion of wax to oil._ Of those medicines which are the\r\ningredients of plasters, some are terrene, as the metals, and some are\r\nkinds of stones and earth, as lees, ashes, and shells; some are oily,\r\nsome tears, some soluble, some inspissated juices, some liquid juices;\r\nalso a few admit seeds, herbs, and roots. Of plasters themselves, some\r\nare vulnerary, and are called bloody, agglutinative, and plasters for\r\nfractures, which must be composed of desiccants, not in the extreme,\r\nbut in the second order complete, and the commencement of the third.\r\nSuch are willow, oak, cypress, the barks of pine and pitch-tree, myrrh,\r\nrosemary, bitumen, aloes, birthwort, the ashes of the wood of vine,\r\nceruse, litharge, and the most of the metals. They are boiled until they\r\ndo not stain. The cicatrizing plasters are also composed of desiccants,\r\nbut more so than the agglutinants. Such are, burnt copper, the squama\r\næris and ferri, verdigris, chalcitis, the flower of burnt copper, alum,\r\ngall, molybdæna, calamine, pumice-stone, and the shells. The discutient\r\nare formed from the calefacient and moderately desiccative, such as\r\nbirthwort, thapsia, old oil, and the oil of radishes, honey, opobalsam,\r\npitch, turpentine, galbanum, burnt salts, and the flower of salt. The\r\nemollient are formed from litharge, fats, marrow, old oil, bee-glue,\r\nammoniac, storax, galbanum, bdellium, mastich, turpentine, the root of\r\nmarsh-mallows, and of the wild cucumber. The desiccative are made of\r\nsulphur, natron, salts, ashes, bitumen. The epispastic are formed from\r\nsalts, natron, bee-glue, verdigris, leaven, dung, sulphur, turpentine.\r\nThe digestive are composed of wax, ladanum, dried grape, amomum, saffron,\r\nfrankincense, pitch, Egyptian mastich, storax, myrrh, galbanum, butter,\r\nœsypum, fats, verdigris. The suppurative are formed from water and oil,\r\npollen, wheaten bread, chondrus, butter, the fat of swine and of calves,\r\nfrankincense, pitch, rosin. The paregoric are made of litharge, ceruse,\r\noil, dill, camomile, starch, white wax. The bloody-plasters (as they are\r\ncalled) are to be applied when the wounds and fractures are recent, and\r\nto co-operate with them, sponges soaked in oxycrate are to be bound on,\r\nabove the pledgets, and are to be loosened on the third day, and the\r\nsame pledgets and not others, again applied.

Others clean the wool in wine, and having dried the\r\nwine with the sordes, which they call _pinon_, at the time of using, add\r\nof it, oz. iij, and the other things as mentioned.\r\n\r\n_On the mixture of wax to oil._ If you wish to prepare ointments like\r\nthose called Acopa, add four parts of the oil to the wax; but if, as in\r\nfractures, you wish to make a soft cerate, make it double. When we wish\r\nto give the medicine the form of a plaster, then we mix equal parts of\r\noil with wax, if the atmosphere be of a moderate temperature. But if the\r\nwax be old or dry, and the atmosphere cold, then there must be a little\r\nmore of the oil than of the wax; when the wax is soft and the atmosphere\r\nwarm, the wax should be a little less than the oil. This _little_ should\r\nbe the twelfth part on each side of the middle, for in this case you will\r\nmix xj or xiij oz. of oil to the pound of wax.\r\n\r\n_From the works of Antyllus, on the boiling of those medicines which\r\nare the ingredients of plasters._—Litharge. In the boiling of the\r\nmedicines, the litharge will be boiled with the oil; but the litharge\r\nhaving been previously triturated, is to be triturated again with the\r\noil, so as to become viscid, and then it is to be boiled at a gentle\r\nfire, stirring incessantly. At first, then, it swells and bubbles; but\r\nwhen nearly boiled sufficiently, it becomes of a more feculent colour.\r\nIt has attained its measure of boiling when the swelling subsides, and\r\nit no longer stains. The molybdæna is to be boiled in a similar manner\r\nto litharge; but the measure of the boiling of it is not only when it\r\nceases to stain, but when it changes from a fiery colour to a yellow\r\nand strongly florid. Burnt copper in boiling is not to be put in at the\r\ncommencement, but when the plaster is half boiled: the measure of the\r\nboiling, unless a small quantity only is put in, is when its colour\r\npredominates and renders the plaster yellow; sori and diphryges are put\r\nin during the boiling. The measure of the boiling of the diphryges,\r\nlike the squama, is to be when its colour predominates. With regard\r\nto the sori, there is no particular measure, except the common one,\r\nto make the plaster of such a consistence that it does not stain. The\r\nchalcitis is boiled like copper, and the measure of it is the degree to\r\nwhich it renders the plaster of a deeper yellow and more ruddy colour.\r\nThe flower of copper is like copper, and is regulated by the common\r\nmeasure of boiling. Copperas (blue vitriol?) is added in the middle of\r\nthe boiling, and when boiled it gives a stronger shade to the colour of\r\nthe plaster; and if not prevented by other circumstances, it renders\r\nthe plaster black; misy is added in the end, but there is no particular\r\nmeasure with regard to it; arsenic and sandarach are added at the end of\r\nthe boiling; burnt lead is put in at the middle of the boiling; ceruse\r\nis put into white plasters at the end, for thus it preserves their\r\ncolour and whitens them still more, but it is added to the black at the\r\ncommencement, for by being more boiled it becomes blacker; verdigris is\r\nadded to the green plasters after the boiling; and, in some cases, it\r\nis not put into the pot at all, but being triturated with vinegar, and\r\nremaining in the mortar, the other things are mixed with it: to those\r\nof an apple colour (pale red?) it is added when the preparation is half\r\nboiled; for when it undergoes moderate boiling, it puts on the apple\r\ncolour; but in those which are to have a double appearance, and double\r\ncolour, we must boil the verdigris immediately after the commencement;\r\nwhen the boiling is persevered in, it first puts on the apple colour,\r\nthen the double appearance, and at last its colour becomes yellow; alum\r\nis added for the most part after the boiling, but there is no measure\r\nof its boiling; vermilion is added at the end; calamine and pompholyx\r\nare added at the commencement; salts and natron are added at the middle\r\nof the boiling; sulphur at the end, the boiling of it blackens the\r\nplasters. All earths and stones are added at the end for the most part:\r\npumice-stone, too, at the end. Burnt shells are added at the end. Oil,\r\nif added at the commencement to rosin and liquid pitch, prevents the\r\nplaster from acquiring consistence. The oil, therefore, is to be added\r\nafter it has acquired consistence. Other fatty substances which do not\r\ncontain salt, are to be added at the middle of the boiling. Of ointments,\r\nthe Irinum bears boiling, the Cyprinum and Rosaceum less; the others,\r\nnone at all. The ingredients are, therefore, to be added at the end of\r\nthe boiling. Wax is not boiled alone by itself, for it burns, neither\r\nwith liquid rosin nor liquid pitch, for it remains disunited. But it is\r\nadded to pure oil or oily matters boiled with the metals, or to rosin\r\nand pitch, previously boiled and thickened with other things which are\r\nto be added. Dried rosin is added with wax. The liquid, before all other\r\nthings, is boiled by itself, unless a very small quantity is used.\r\nPitch is added before all other things. The measure of the boiling of\r\nthe liquid is its acquiring consistence; but of the dry especially, if\r\nboiled with vinegar, when it ceases to bubble and swell. The pitch of\r\nships, when triturated and separated by a sieve from its recrements, is\r\nsprinkled upon a plaster when boiled; but if soft, it is dissolved with\r\nthe oil. The former method is the more correct, because in the second the\r\nweight is not preserved. Bitumen (asphaltos) is boiled by being added\r\nat the commencement. But it is not to be levigated, because it contains\r\nasperities like grains of figs. It is, therefore, to be broken into large\r\npieces and boiled in vinegar, not stirring it lest it bubble. I, says\r\nTimocrates, have succeeded by boiling it in oil. Bee-glue (propolis)\r\nis to be softened and boiled. For, by the boiling, it is not entirely\r\nincorporated. But if the plaster receives, as an ingredient, common wax,\r\nthe bee-glue, like the galbanum, is to be pounded with the wax and added.\r\nAmmoniac is added about the middle of the boiling. But if it can be\r\nlevigated, it should be sprinkled in the state of a powder, but if not,\r\nit may be triturated with some liquid; but if it be a plaster for fresh\r\nwounds, it is to be triturated with vinegar or wine; but if for fistulæ\r\nor strumæ, by all means with vinegar. If it be a soft plaster (such as\r\nthose for the fundament), it is to be triturated with water; then, being\r\nlevigated, it is to be added to the other things when cooled that they\r\nmay not boil. Opoponax is added much later than ammoniac: it requires\r\nbut very little boiling; but it must be frequently triturated with wine\r\nor vinegar. Galbanum does not bear boiling. But when the plaster has\r\nattained such a consistence that it does not stain, it is to be taken\r\noff the fire, and it is to be softened and added. Sagapenum is pounded\r\nin a mortar, and when it becomes tender it is softened with the plaster\r\nafter being removed from the fire. Aloe is sprinkled after the boiling.\r\nPoppy-juice is macerated for one day in a little water, and is then\r\nlevigated in a mortar, and in this state the plaster is poured upon it.\r\nThapsia is sprinkled last, or triturated with some fluid. Bdellium being\r\nlevigated, is sprinkled after the plaster is taken from the fire; but if\r\nit is of a fatty nature, and cannot be levigated, it is to be pounded\r\nlike sagapen, and made into the form of a plaster, and softened with the\r\nplaster after the boiling. Frankincense and manna are sprinkled at the\r\nend of the boiling, becoming glutinous, with a little honey, vinegar,\r\nwater, or wine, if the plaster admit a liquid. Myrrh is added when the\r\nboiling is over. None of the seeds, roots, and herbs can endure boiling;\r\nbut when levigated, and while they remain in the mortar, the other things\r\nare poured upon them in a state of solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. The following are the general directions given by Celsus for\r\nthe formation of plasters: “Emplastrum hoc modo fit: arida medicamenta\r\nper se teruntur; deinde mixtis his instillatur aut acetum, aut si quis\r\nalius non pinguis humor accessurus est, et ea rursus ex eo teruntur;\r\nea vero quæ liquari possunt, ad ignem simul liquantur, et si quid olei\r\nmisceri debet, tum infunditur: interdum etiam aridum ali quod ex oleo\r\nprius coquitur.” He describes the composition of 28 plasters. (v, 19.)\r\n\r\nThe composition of plasters is treated of by Galen at so great length\r\nthat it is quite out of the question to attempt even an abstract of his\r\naccount of them. His accuracy of detail and attention to minutiæ are\r\nalmost inconceivable. See the first four books of his work (De Med. sec.\r\ngenera.) Our author, as usual, is much indebted to him.\r\n\r\nFor further information regarding the emplastra of the ancients, see also\r\nHaly Abbas (Pract. x, 18); Mesue (De Unguentis); and Myrepsus (§ x.)\r\nMyrepsus, as usual, is most copious: he gives formulæ for 199 plasters.\r\n\r\nThe _diachylon plaster_ is described by Galen and Mesue, but as the\r\ningredients of theirs are nearly the same as in that of our author, we\r\nneed not give their formulæ.\r\n\r\nThe _Ægyptiacum_, which is still celebrated as a remedy in certain cases\r\nis thus described by Mesue: “Take of verdigris, dr. v; of honey, dr. xiv;\r\nof very acrid vinegar, dr. vij: boil to a proper consistence. Some also\r\nadd dr. iiss of triturated frankincense.”\r\n\r\nThe following is an _itch ointment_ by Mesue: “Take of ceruse, of\r\nlitharge, of aloes, of saffron, of calamine, of mercury extinguished,\r\nequal parts; make into an ointment, with oil of oleander and vinegar, q.\r\ns.”\r\n\r\nAn _itch ointment_ of Myrepsus consists of the fresh leaves of the\r\nbay-tree boiled with oil, and having wax and sulphur added to it. We can\r\nsay, from ample experience, that such an ointment is a most effectual\r\nremedy for scabies.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the _basilicon_, as directed by Avicenna, is a nearer\r\napproach to the modern ointment of that name than our author’s: “Of\r\nrosin, of pitch, and of wax, equal parts, prepare with olive oil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVIII.—ON EMOLLIENT PLASTERS AND EPITHEMES.\r\n\r\nOf those applications called emollient plasters, or malagmata, some\r\nare applied to the middle parts of the body when in a state of chronic\r\ninflammation, or indurated, or in a hot or cold state, or affected with\r\ndefluxions; and some to the extremities when infarcted, or to the nerves\r\nwhen affected with cold; or they are serviceable to the other parts when\r\nscirrhous. These have been treated of in the section on Plasters, and\r\nwill be treated of in that on Acopa. Of those which agree with the middle\r\nparts of the body (which are properly called epithemes), those applied\r\nfor the stomach and liver, of whatever kind they are, must require a\r\nstrengthening power from astringents; for without these there will be\r\ndanger to the life, the functional operations of these parts being\r\nextensive; and, therefore, they are principally composed of aromatics.\r\nWhen the stomach then is affected with dyspepsia, atony, or inflation,\r\nthose from seeds, and from melilots, aloes, and wormwood, from sampsuchum\r\n(marjoram), nard, and mastich are to be applied. To the liver, those\r\nfrom nutben, ammoniac, fats, and chamomile ointment; and to the spleen,\r\nthose from quicklime, arsenic, capers, willows, cardamom, verdigris,\r\nammoniac, and vinegar are to be applied. For defluxions about the belly,\r\nthose from wild vine, alum, apple ointment, and other astringents\r\nare to be used. And these by a misnomer are called by the general\r\nname of malagmata or emollient plasters, although their power be the\r\nreverse of softening.

Le Clerc thus describes these preparations: “Ce qu’on\r\nappelloit malagma ne différoit fort de l’emplâtre. Galien déclare\r\n(Pharmac. gén. vii, 5) qu’il est indifférent qu’on se serve du terme de\r\nmalagme, ou de celui d’emplâtre.” He adds, “Ce qu’on appelloit epithème\r\nétoit aussi à peu près le même chose.” (Hist. de la Méd.) According to\r\nGalen, the malagmata derived their name from being used as emollient\r\napplications to parts in an indurated state, and were all moderately\r\ncalefacient, being in general neither desiccative nor humectative. He\r\ndescribes the composition of these preparations with his usual accuracy\r\nand minuteness.\r\n\r\nCelsus gives a full account of the malagmata. He says plasters,\r\nmalagmata, and pastils differ, inasmuch as malagmata consist principally\r\nof aromatics, whereas, the other two are rather formed from metallic\r\nsubstances. In general, he says, they are rather calefacient than\r\nrefrigerant; some, however, are refrigerant, and are used as applications\r\nto the joints in gout. A few are not only calefacient but also\r\nepispastic. He gives prescriptions for 35 malagmata. He makes no mention\r\nof epithemes. (v, 17, 2.) Scribonius Largus, likewise, treats fully of\r\nthe malagmata (§ cclv-cclxvii).\r\n\r\nOribasius states that there are three varieties of malagmata: the first\r\nconsisting of dry things, namely, roots and herbs; the second kind, of\r\nmetallic substances, or a certain proportion thereof; and the third, of\r\njuices, suet, and tears. (Med. Collect. x, 28.)\r\n\r\nA full account of them is given by Actuarius (Meth. Med. vi, 9) and\r\nMyrepsus (§ xi, xxxiv.) The following epitheme is said to be powerfully\r\npurgative: “Of scammony, of elaterium, of spurge, of each, dr. viij; of\r\nwhite and of black hellebore, of bull’s gall, of each, dr. iij; of the\r\nroot of the wild cucumber, of the leaves of wormwood, of each dr. x; of\r\nTuscan wax, dr. viij; of turpentine rosin, dr. iv; of Attic honey, oz.\r\nviij; of red nitre, oz. j.” (Myrepsus, l. c.)\r\n\r\nThe following is a malagma for luxated joints and contusions: “Of\r\ngalbanum, oz. j; of saffron, dr. ij; of ammoniac perfume, of pure wax,\r\nof each, oz. iss; of dried pitch, lb. iss; of very acrid vinegar, coch.\r\niss.” (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIX.—ON RESTORATIVE OINTMENTS (ACOPA), LINIMENTS, CALEFACIENT\r\nPLASTERS (DROPACES), AND SINAPISMS.\r\n\r\nThe acopa are so named for having been first invented for the feeling\r\nof lassitude, as a tensive, ulcerative, and osseous lassitude; but they\r\nagree with many other complaints. Some, then, are calefacient, some\r\nemollient, and some stimulant. The calefacient are prepared from pepper,\r\npellitory, the seed of rosemary, and the like. They agree with affections\r\nof the nerves, and strong frigidity which cannot be readily restored to\r\nheat. The emollient agree with induration, scirrhus, and infarction of\r\nthe joints; and the materials of which they are formed have been pointed\r\nout by us when treating of plasters. The stimulant being composed of\r\nlemnestis, the seed of rosemary, euphorbium, the granum cnidium, and the\r\nlike, are to be used in chronic affections, and such as are difficult\r\nto dislodge, namely, in such cases as sinapisms are applicable. The\r\nconsistence of all the acopa is to be intermediate between the cerates\r\nand plasters. The liniments resemble the acopa, but have a more liquid\r\nconsistence. The dropax has a two-fold composition, the one being like\r\na plaster, and the other like a malagma. Some rub them into the part\r\nwarm. Their materials are like those of the acopa and plasters. It serves\r\nthe purpose of a cataplasm, agreeing with the same chronic affections\r\nin which sinapisms are applicable. A dropax (“calefacient plaster”) is\r\napplied before a sinapism, in order to prepare the body for the mustard;\r\nand after the sinapism, in order to remove the residue of the complaint.\r\nThe sinapism is not composed of many ingredients, but is a most powerful\r\napplication, agreeing particularly with chronic affections after all\r\nother remedies have been tried in vain. It is more especially applicable\r\nin cephalæa, hemicrania, epilepsy, vertigo, and mania, when applied to\r\nthe head; and in asthma, orthopnœa, and chronic cough when applied to\r\nthe chest; and in chronic catarrh, a sinapism may be applied both to the\r\nhead and chest; and to the stomach and belly in chronic affections of\r\nthem. It is a suitable remedy in all ischiatic and podagric cases, to any\r\npart which has lost its tone, or is in a cold state, and cannot easily\r\nbe warmed. The limits of the action of the medicine are, when violent\r\npain has been produced, and the flesh becomes more livid and swelled up,\r\nand so that after the bath it may become blistered in a mild manner. But\r\nif the sensibility has been lost, care must be taken lest the burning\r\nproceed too far without being perceived, and therefore the part is to be\r\noften uncovered and examined. Of acute diseases, lethargy, cataphora,\r\nand catochus admit of sinapisms, which, if at the commencement, are to\r\nbe applied to the legs, but if the matter has fixed in the part, to the\r\nhead. Those which are in a cold state and cannot be warmed but with\r\ndifficulty, must have sinapisms applied to the legs and arms. Sinapisms\r\nare to be entirely proscribed when there is continued fever or an ulcer;\r\nalso in affections of cartilaginous parts, and such as have no flesh.\r\nFor the parts which are devoid of flesh are sometimes burnt black when\r\nsinapisms are applied to them.\r\n\r\n_The acopon called Bromion._ Of wax, of Colophonian rosin, of common\r\nrosin, of each, lb. j; of hog’s lard, oz. iv; of butter, oz. vj; of\r\nmarshmallows, of fenugreek, of linseed, of each, lb. ij; of oil, lb. j;\r\nof galbanum, oz. iiss.

Having first prepared the part with natron, apply.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of a sinapism._ On the preceding day, dried figs are\r\nto be macerated in tepid water, and next day they are to be properly\r\nfiltrated and strongly pounded. Then some acrid mustard, such as the\r\nSyriac and Egyptian, is to be triturated separately, pouring on it a\r\nlittle of the infusion, and mixing and forming into a mass; if we wish\r\nto form a strong sinapism, joining two parts of mustard to one of dried\r\nfigs, but if weak, in the inverse proportion; and if a moderate one,\r\nmixing equal parts. If the mustard before it is triturated, be allowed\r\nto macerate in vinegar, as some do, it becomes weaker. After the mustard\r\nhas been cleared away, and the bath used, if the pain continue violent,\r\nor if redness and blisters supervene, we are to wet a cloth in the juice\r\nof mallows, or of fenugreek, with oil of roses, and apply. Then we may\r\nuse the rose cerate with ceruse. But in cases of paralysis, when the\r\nsensibility is impaired, care must be taken, and the part frequently\r\nuncovered and examined, for often they are burnt immoderately without\r\nbeing sensible of it. And goat’s dung, applied with vinegar, is more\r\nefficacious than mustard, especially in diseases of the hip-joint.\r\n\r\n_The liniment from writing-ink acting as a rubefacient, especially in\r\ncases of hemicrania.

Le Clerc says of the Acopa: “On les appelloit _acopa_\r\ncomme qui diroit, _Unguens qui ôtent les douleurs_, ou la lassitude,\r\nparcequ’on s’en servoit principalement pour le délasser, ou pour apaiser\r\nles douleurs qu’on sent après le travail et la fatigue.” (Hist. de la\r\nMéd.) Galen explains that although this class of ointments derived\r\ntheir name from their being originally used as soothing applications to\r\nparts which were pained from severe exertion, they came afterwards to\r\nbe applied for various other purposes, as for removing all deep-seated\r\npains, indurations, contractions, and the like. Their consistence, he\r\nsays, is nearly the same as that of the liquid cerates or the ointments\r\nmade from wax and oil. According to their qualities, he adds, they have\r\nthe epithets of emollient, calefacient, anodyne, relaxant, or alterative,\r\napplied to them. He describes, in prose and verse, the composition of\r\nan almost countless variety of these preparations. (De med. sec. gen.\r\nvii.) Celsus says of the acopa: “Acopa quoque utilia nervis sunt.” He\r\ngives formulæ only for two acopa, which consist of aromatic and stimulant\r\nmedicines mixed with oil or some fragrant ointment. (v, 25.) Oribasius\r\ndivides them into three kinds, the emollient, the calefacient, and the\r\nscarifacient; the last being a near approach to sinapisms. On the acopa\r\nsee further Scribonius and Actuarius.\r\n\r\nThe _liniments_ of the ancients seem to have been very much the same as\r\nthose of the moderns. Celsus says of them: “Ἔγχριστα autem Græci vocant\r\nliquida qui illinuntur.” (v, 243.) In consistence and qualities they\r\nnearly resembled the acopa, being composed of a large proportion of oil\r\nwith a small quantity of wax or honey. Myrepsus gives prescriptions for a\r\nconsiderable number of them.\r\n\r\nThe _dropax_ is thus described by Le Clerc: “On étendoit une certaine\r\nquantité de cette emplâtre sur la toile, ou la peau; on appliquoit cela\r\nsur quelque partie du corps, on le levoit, ou on l’arrachoit, et on\r\nl’appliquoit derechef, reitérant souvent la même chose, pour faire rougir\r\nla partie, dans le dessein d’attirer en dehors les humeurs, ou les sucs\r\nqui servent à la nourriture des parties, ou dans la vue d’ouvrir les\r\npores. Pour rendre cette emplâtre plus efficace on y ajoutoit quelquefois\r\ndes poudres acres, comme du pyréthre, du poivre, du sel, du soufre. On\r\nemploit aussi le dropax pour faire tomber, ou pour arracher le poil de\r\nquelque partie.” (Hist. de la Méd.) Hesychius appears to have confounded\r\nthe _dropax_ with the _psilothron_ or _depilatory_. The former was merely\r\na sort of calefacient plaster, and was applied to parts not covered\r\nwith hairs. Oribasius says of it that it is prepared like the malagma.\r\nWhen it is desired to make it calefacient, he directs us to add to it\r\npellitory, the seed of rosemary, and bitumen; when desiccative, the\r\nsulphur vivum, salts, and the ashes of vegetables; and when it is wished\r\nto make it of such a nature as to scarify the parts, he directs us to\r\nadd to it limnesium (adarce) and spurge. The part to which it is to be\r\napplied, he says, if weak, should be shaven, but in the more robust, and\r\nwhen a stronger application is required, it need not be shaven, unless\r\nit is to be applied to the head, chin, or pubes. Myrepsus commends the\r\nfollowing dropax: “Take of bitumen, oz. ij; of wax, oz. j, sext. j; of\r\ndried pitch, dr. j; of pine-rosin, of natron, of each, oz. j; of sulphur\r\nvivum, of pellitory, of white hellebore, of adarce, of each, sext. j; of\r\nstavesacre, of spurge, of each, dr. ⅛; of oil, q. s.” Certain forms of\r\nthe dropax seem to have been allied to the _blistering plasters_ of the\r\nmoderns. On this subject we cannot do better than copy the remarks of Dr.\r\nClinch, in his Preface to Ruffus Ephesius: “Quantum usus cantharidum, ex\r\nquibus hodierna vesicantia ubique fere componuntur, veteribus innotuit,\r\nvir Doctissimus Johannes Freind luculenter satis explicuit. Nequeo autem\r\nhic silentio transire, quam graviter erratum sit a Georgio Baglivi,\r\nqui Oribasii meminit, utpote primi ex Arabibus, qui de usu vesicantium\r\nscripsit, quum eundem et Græcum fuisse, et Græcorum idiomate scripsisse,\r\nnemo non noverit. Is profecto aliquid suggerit de eo vesicantium genere,\r\nquæ dropaces et sinapismi dicuntur, qui ex sinapi, pipere, pyrethro et\r\nejusmodi acribus medicamentis conficiebantur, et semel quidem cantharidum\r\nmentionem facit, neutiquam vero, quod scio, de his loquitur tanquam de\r\nmedicina, quâ ad vesicas in cute excitandas utebantur. Ætius quidem\r\ndropacis formam exhibuit, quæ tres cantharidum drachmas recipit, unde\r\ndropax exulcerans vulgo audit.”\r\n\r\nOribasius gives, from Antyllus, a most interesting and judicious account\r\nof the _sinapism_. He says that it does not suit with acute diseases,\r\nor, at least, only when the patient is of an inert constitution, and the\r\nsensibility is obtuse. It is applicable, however, he says, in almost\r\nall chronic diseases when other remedies have failed, except in the\r\ncase of an ulcer in the lungs or liver, or when the disease is seated\r\nin a cartilaginous part. He recommends it in all cases of diminished\r\nsensibility. The only acute diseases in which he represents it as\r\napplicable are lethargy, catochus, carus, or fevers attended with loss\r\nof heat and diminished sensibility. Like our author, he directs us to\r\nprepare the sinapism with dried figs and mustard. Aëtius, upon the\r\nauthority of Archigenes, details its medicinal properties in nearly the\r\nsame terms. Both Aëtius and Oribasius represent goat’s dung, pounded\r\nwith vinegar, as being equally efficacious as the sinapism, and applying\r\nparticularly to ischiatic diseases. Myrepsus’s account agrees exactly\r\nwith that of our author. He mentions that some macerate the figs in\r\nvinegar instead of water, but says that it renders the preparation\r\nweaker. The Arabians prepared the sinapism exactly as the Greeks, and\r\napplied it in similar cases. See Mesue (De Unguentis, i.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XX.—DIFFERENT PREPARATIONS OF OILS AND OINTMENTS.\r\n\r\nOf unguents and ointments, or of oils in the form of ointments, some\r\nare simple, having only one article added to the oil, and some are\r\nprepared and compounded from more substances. Of the simple some are\r\nformed from flowers put into the oil, such as the oil of roses, that\r\nof chamomile, and the susinum, or oil of lilies; some are formed from\r\nfruits and seeds, and some from certain shoots, as of rue, which are\r\nboiled along with the oil, none of the flowers admitting boiling, and\r\ntherefore they are rather exposed to the sun. But if their fragrance be\r\nstrong and permanent, if exposed for a number of days to the sun, they\r\nbecome finer and more useful, such as the oils of roses and chamomile.\r\nBut such flowers as are weaker and more volatile bear less insolation,\r\nbeing easily dissipated, such as the lily and violet. Of those formed\r\nfrom fruits and seeds, some are formed from them added whole to the oil,\r\nsuch as the melinum or oil of apples; and some have them pounded or\r\naltered, and the oily part of them removed, either by being squeezed out\r\nin a press and thus separated, such as the oils of walnuts, of sesame, of\r\nalmonds, of lentisk, of bay, of Palma Christi, of radish, and the like.\r\nThe compound ones are principally composed of aromatic herbs, which are\r\nboiled in the oil with wine, must, or water, and filtrated, some juices,\r\nand sometimes fats and marrows, being mixed with the oil. Of these, some\r\nbeing of a strictly oily consistence, are called, simply, ointments or\r\nunguents, as the gleucinum, nardinum, sicyonium, and cyprinum: but some\r\nhaving the consistence of acopa, and receiving wax, rosin, or the like,\r\ninto their composition, are called myracopa, such as the decamyron,\r\namaracinum, and those resembling them. And some are boiled only once,\r\nnamely, such as do not consist of complex materials, as the metopium,\r\nmastichinum, and sicyonium; and some at two, three, or four successive\r\nadditions, the articles which are most difficult to boil being first\r\nput in, such as rosewood, spathe, frankincense-tree, and bay; then the\r\naromatics, Indian-leaf, spikenard, amomum, savin; and, last of all, the\r\njuices, fats, marrow, and perhaps wax and rosins being added. The juice\r\nof balsam, or opobalsam, is not boiled at all, but is added after the\r\nboiling is over, and the ointment moderately cooled; and of the ointments\r\nsome do not admit of boiling at all, but the ingredients are only mixed,\r\nas the mendesium; but some, when wishing to prepare the green ointment,\r\nafter taking it from the fire, an oz. iss of well-triturated verdigris\r\nhaving been put into lb. v of oil, as in the cyprinum and amaracinum, dip\r\nthe ointment in this mixture. The simple ointments are possessed of the\r\npowers of the articles added to them, or which are pounded in them, the\r\noil being but the groundwork (as it were) or vehicle of them. The nature\r\nof all the complex ointments inclines to heating; but some are powerfully\r\ncalefacient and emollient, so as to agree with cases of ancylosis and\r\ninfarction, as the metopium, mendesium, marciatum. The pentamyron is more\r\nmoderate, as the decamyron is stronger, so as to abrade the surface; but\r\nthose which are moderately hot are subtile, paregoric, and digestive,\r\nsuch as the susinum, amaracinum, irinum, crocinum, foliatum. Some,\r\nin addition to their heating qualities, are sufficiently desiccative\r\nand cutting, such as the cyprinum and sicyonium: some are powerfully\r\nheating, and rather tonic, and hence they agree with the stomach and\r\nviscera in particular when relaxed, such as the mastichinum, nardinum,\r\ngleucinum; but the most tonic are those prepared from wild olives;\r\nbut some ointments are used only by women for their fragrant smell,\r\nas the foliatum, spicatum, commagenum, and those called moschelæa or\r\ncompositions of musk and oil.\r\n\r\n_The rosaceum, or oil of roses._ Of red roses deprived of their nails (or\r\nthe white extremities of their flowers), and dried for a night and a day,\r\noz. iij; of the oil of unripe olives, one Italian sextarius. Having bound\r\nup the vessel carefully, so that it may not evaporate, expose to the\r\nsun in open air for forty days, and then deposit the vessel, not on the\r\npavement, but upon a table: some instead of the insolation put the vessel\r\ninto a well, in order that its fragrance may be preserved by the cold,\r\nbut others bury it underground.\r\n\r\n_The chamæmelinum, or oil of chamomile._ Of the flower of chamomile,\r\nwithout the white petals, which has been dried for a night and a day, oz.\r\nij; of oil, one Italian sextarius. Cover over the vessel with a plain\r\npiece of cloth, so as to allow it to transpire for forty days, after\r\nwhich it is to be carefully covered over and laid up.\r\n\r\n_The anethinum, or oil of dill._ Of the hair of the green dill, dried,\r\noz. j; of sweet oil, an Italian sextarius: expose to the sun in like\r\nmanner. The oil of dill may likewise be prepared at once, without\r\nexposure to the sun; for the hair of dried dill may be boiled in a double\r\nvessel, and used; and the oil of chamomile may be prepared in like\r\nmanner; but they are weaker than those from green dill, and especially if\r\nmade by exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\n_The liliaceum, or oil of lilies, called also susinum, perhaps from\r\nhaving been invented in Susa._ Of the petals of white lilies, dried in\r\nlike manner, oz. ij are to be added to an Italian sextarius of oil, and\r\ncarefully covered over so as to prevent it from evaporating, and exposed\r\nto the sun for three days, after which, the first being filtered and\r\nthrown away, other two ounces are to be added for other three days, and\r\nthus laid up.\r\n\r\n_The compound susinum, or oil of lilies._ Of oil, sext. iij; of aromatic\r\ncane, oz. v; of myrrh, oz. v; of cardamom, oz. iij; of the petals of\r\nlily, deprived of their nails and dried, lb. j; of cinnamon, oz. iij; of\r\nCilician saffron, oz. v. The whole process is to be divided into three\r\nsuccessive additions. First, we are to macerate the myrrh and the calamus\r\nin wine for five days, stirring it three times a day, and then we are to\r\nboil it with the oil for a very short time. Secondly, we are to macerate\r\nthe cardamom in water for three days, stirring it in like manner, and\r\nthen we are to boil it with the oil for one hour. Having filtrated, we\r\nadd to the pure oil the third part of the lilies, and after three days,\r\nagain having filtrated, we put in the other third of the lilies; and\r\nagain, after three days having filtrated and thrown away the first, we\r\nare to add the remainder with triturated saffron. But after other three\r\ndays, the oil being filtrated, we add to it the cinnamon pounded, or,\r\ninstead of it, arnabo, or double the quantity of cassia or carpesium, and\r\nlay it up.\r\n\r\n_The iaton, violaceum, or oil of violets._ They prepare the oil of\r\nviolets, some from the purple, some from saffron-like, and some from\r\nwhite violets, adding oz. iij of the leaves deprived of their nails to\r\nan Italian sextarius of the oil of unripe olives; and covering it up\r\ncarefully to prevent it from evaporating; they insolate it for ten days,\r\nchanging them three times after every three days like the lilies. And in\r\nlaying them up, they add a few completely dried.\r\n\r\n_The melinum, or oil of apples._ This is prepared from Cydonian apples\r\n_or_ quinces, which are to be rubbed externally with a piece of cloth and\r\ncut into pieces with their bark; and then lb. iij of them are to be added\r\nto x Italian sext. of oil of unripe olives, and insolated for forty days.\r\n\r\n_The sesaminum, or oil of oily-grain._ The oil of sesame is prepared from\r\noily grains bruised, softened, and squeezed in strainers with screws, or\r\nfrom the oily part separated in hot water and laid up in vessels of glass.\r\n\r\n_The raphaninum, or oil of radishes._ And this is prepared after the same\r\nmanner in Egypt from the seed of the radishes with small roots, pounded,\r\nand the oil separated.\r\n\r\n_The ricinum, oil of Palma Christi, or castor-oil._ This also is prepared\r\nafter the same manner in Egypt from the seed of the ricinus, which is\r\ncalled croton, similarly pounded or levigated.\r\n\r\n_The ægirinum, or oil of the black poplar._ It is found in the season of\r\nspring when there is much rosin in the seed. For breaking down the grains\r\nof black poplar, they add oz. iv of them to sext. j of sweet oil and\r\ninsolate for forty days, or boil in a double vessel for three hours, and\r\nthus filtrate and lay up.\r\n\r\n_The amygdalinum, or oil of almonds._ This is prepared like the\r\naforementioned, pure bitter almonds being bruised, a little water poured\r\nin, and the oil separated as described above. Some add oz. ij of pounded\r\nalmonds to an Italian sextarius of sweet oil, and boil in a double vessel.\r\n\r\n_The oil of almonds, which is called metopium._ The Egyptians, who\r\ninvented this oil, called it metopium, because it contains galbanum,\r\nand the shrub from which the galbanum is got is called metopium. It\r\nadmits the following things: of the oil of unripe olives, sext. xx; of\r\nbitter almonds, lb. ij; of cardamom, lb. j; of the schœnanth, of calamus\r\naromaticus, of carpobalsam, of each, lb. j; of myrrh, of galbanum, of\r\neach, oz. vj; of turpentine, lb. ij; of fragrant wine to soak the dry\r\narticles, sext. iv; of Attic honey, lb. iij. The rosin and galbanum being\r\ntriturated and dissolved in part of the oil, we put them into the other\r\nthings boiled, and then add the honey. When all the things are properly\r\nmixed, and while it is still tepid, we remove it from the fire and strain\r\nit, for it becomes thick when it cools.\r\n\r\n_The balaninum, or oil of acorns._ The oil of acorns is prepared like the\r\noil of almonds, from the acorns of oaks.\r\n\r\n_The caryinum, or oil of walnuts._ This is prepared like the aforesaid,\r\nfrom old walnuts.\r\n\r\n_Laurinum, or oil of bay._ The plain oil is formed in the same manner\r\nfrom the fruit of bay, but the mixed is prepared thus: of ripe olives,\r\nsext. j is added to sext. ij of bay-berries, and all pounded and\r\nexpressed. Some mix equal parts of each.\r\n\r\n_The lentiscinum, or oil of lentisk._ And this is prepared in the same\r\nmanner as the oil of bay, from the fruit of lentisk, in two ways, by\r\nitself and with olives, not ripe but sour.\r\n\r\n_The mastichinum, or oil of mastich._ The most simple kind is formed\r\nof Chian mastich, oz. j, being added to an Italian sextarius of oil of\r\nunripe olives, and boiled in a double vessel. Some add also, of wormwood\r\nand of storax, of each, oz. j.\r\n\r\n_A more complex oil of mastich._ Of oil, sext. L; of elecampane, lb. v;\r\nof xylobalsam, lb. x; of the schœnanth, lb. v; of cardamom, lb. vij; of\r\nmastich, lb. v; of the wood of mastich, lb. viij; of turpentine, lb. iij;\r\nof the hair of wormwood, lb. j; of fragrant wine, sext. v; of water,\r\nsext. j. The dry things being previously macerated in wine for three\r\ndays, are mixed with the oil and the water, and boiled for six hours, and\r\nthen the mastich and turpentine are added, and being properly mixed are\r\nfiltrated, and when cooled are put into a vessel.\r\n\r\n_The simple sicyonian, or oil of cucumbers._ This is prepared by adding\r\noz. ij of the dried root of the wild cucumber to an Italian sextarius of\r\noil, and boiling in a double vessel.\r\n\r\n_The compound oil of cucumbers._ Of oil, sext. x; of the scraped root of\r\nthe wild cucumber, lb. j; of wild thyme, of melilot, of each, oz. v; of\r\nfatty dead pines, of marsh-mallows, of each, oz. v; of asplenium, oz. vj;\r\nof fenugreek, sext. ij. The fenugreek is first soaked in the water for\r\none day and then filtrated, and is added to the things mentioned with oil\r\nand sext. ij of wine; and when all are boiled, there are added of stag’s\r\nmarrow, triturated with a little oil, oz. iv; of the grease of fowls,\r\noz. iv; and when the oil is again filtrated, it is to be deposited in a\r\nvessel. Some also expose it to the sun after boiling forty days.\r\n\r\n_Another oil of cucumbers, more efficacious._ Of the juice of elaterium,\r\nsext. iij; of round and of long birthwort, of storax, of elecampane, of\r\nhyssop, of iris, of colocynth, of pennyroyal, of origany, of cyperus, of\r\nfrankincense-tree, of centaury, of bay-leaves, of each, oz. ij; of oil,\r\nsext. v. Having mixed, boil until but little of the juice remain.\r\n\r\n_The cyprinum, or oil of privet, from the works of Posidonius._ Of\r\noil, sext. j; of cyperus, of elecampane, of iris, of each, lb. j; of\r\nsampsuchum, of hyssop, of the seed of chaste-tree, of sage, of each, oz.\r\niij; of the flower of privet, lb. j. All the other things having been\r\npreviously macerated in wine for one day, are to be boiled with the oil\r\nfor six hours. To the pure filtrated oil the privet is added, if the\r\ngreen be at hand, with its tender branches not bruised, but otherwise the\r\ndried are to be pounded with a little water, and boiled for an hour and\r\na half. But if you wish to give it colour after taking it from the fire,\r\nadd of pure verdigris, lb. iss. Posidonius, wishing to avoid the acrimony\r\nof the verdigris, directs, after the boiling, to leave the oil for three\r\ndays in a vessel not tinned, and it will acquire the colour, with its\r\npowers unimpaired.\r\n\r\n_Another formula for the oil of privet._ Of citron-leaves, of bay-leaves,\r\nof iris, of cyperus, of sage, of each, oz. iij; of frankincense-tree,\r\nof the long birthwort, of the seed of chaste-tree, of each, oz. iv; of\r\nelecampane, of rosewood, of each, oz. vj; of rue, oz. ij; of cypress, oz.\r\nij; of oil, sext. j. Having first macerated these things in wine, boil\r\nwith oil; and having filtrated, add again of xylobalsam, of xylocassia,\r\nof each, oz. iv; of sampsuch, of cumin, of myrtle, of storax, of mastich,\r\nof each, oz. iij; of opoponax, oz. ij; of the flower of privet, oz. vj;\r\nof verdigris, oz. j.\r\n\r\n_The amaracinum, or oil of marjoram._ Of elecampane, lb. x; of\r\nxylobalsam, lb. xx; of cyperus, lb. viij; of the schœnanth, of rosewood,\r\nof savin, of each, lb. viij; of opoponax, of seed of amaracus, of each,\r\nlb. ij; of primary oil, sext. lxxx; of fragrant oil, sext. v. All the\r\nother things, being first macerated in wine, are to receive the first\r\naddition, but the second addition is to be the savin; and the former\r\narticles are to be boiled six hours, but this only three. Some dip it\r\nand add of verdigris, oz. iij.\r\n\r\n_The irinum, or oil of iris._ Of iris, of rosewood, of cyperus, of each,\r\nlb. v; of opoponax, oz. iij; of alkanet, oz. ij; of oil, sext. xxx; of\r\nwater, sext. xv. Some add also, of the schœnanth, oz. vj; of cassia, oz.\r\niij; of xylobalsam, oz. vj; of Celtic nard, oz. vj. All these things,\r\nbeing bruised, are to be first macerated in water and oil for five days,\r\nand then boiled in a double vessel for six days, and laid up.\r\n\r\n_The crocinum, or oil of saffron, in which is contained the composition\r\nof another crocomagma._ Of the fragrant oil of unripe olives, lb. j; of\r\ncalamus aromaticus, oz. v; of troglodytic myrrh, oz. v; of cardamom,\r\noz. vij; of Cilician saffron, oz. vj. The first addition is to be of\r\nthe calamus and myrrh, which, being triturated with wine, are to be\r\nmacerated for three days, and three times a day stirred with a spatula of\r\npalm: then they are to be boiled with the oil. The second addition is to\r\nconsist of the cardamom which has been macerated in the water for one day\r\nbefore; and the third, of the saffron in wine. Some add other five ounces\r\nof the myrrh with the saffron. Having filtrated, the pure oil is laid up.\r\nThe whole deposit of the articles is formed into trochisks, which, being\r\ndried, constitute what is called the crocomagma.\r\n\r\n_The Mendesium._ It is so called because it was invented in Egypt where\r\nMendes is worshipped. It receives of the oil of acorns, lb. x (in another\r\nformula, sext. x); of myrrh, of cassia fistula, of each, oz. iij; of\r\nturpentine, lb. x (in another formula, sext. x); of cinnamon, oz. iij.\r\nThis is not boiled, but the dry things being put in, are stirred for\r\nsixty days: then the turpentine being melted, is added to part of the\r\noil, and afterwards stirred for sixty days, in which state it is laid up.\r\n\r\n_The marciatum._ Of mastich, of wax, of storax, of each, oz. iij; of\r\nthe medicine œsypum, oz. ss; of opobalsam, oz. iss; of oil of nard, of\r\ngleucinum, of oil of unripe grapes, of each, oz. iij; of stag’s marrow,\r\noz. iss; of turpentine, oz. j.\r\n\r\n_The oil of unripe olives._ The first addition.—Of rosewood, of the\r\nbranches of palms, of melilots, of iris, of the schœnanth, of xylobalsam,\r\nof dried roses, of sweet-cane, of each, oz. iij; of oil of unripe olives,\r\nlb. x; of the juice of unripe olives, sext. x.\r\n\r\nThe second addition.—Of Indian leaf, of amomum, of spikenard, of costus,\r\nof cloves, of cassia, of cassamum, of each, oz. iij (in another formula\r\nalso, of arnabo, oz. iij); of wine, q. s.\r\n\r\nThe third addition.—Of frankincense, of ammoniac perfume, of storax,\r\nof bdellium, of myrrh, of mastich, of each, oz. iij; of wine, q. s.;\r\nof white wax, oz. v; of opobalsam, oz. vj (some make it oz. viij). The\r\narticles of the first addition are to be first macerated for one day\r\nin the juice of unripe olives and the oil; but those of the second in\r\nanother vessel, in Aminæan or some other old and fragrant wine, stirring\r\nevery day with a spatula of palm three times for three days; after\r\nwhich boil in a vessel lined with tin; first, the articles of the first\r\naddition until little remain of the unripe olive juice: then, immediately\r\nadd those of the second with the wine. But it is better, having first\r\nfiltrated, to add these things to the pure oil; and when boiled until\r\nlittle of the wine be left, in order that the oil may not be burnt, take\r\nit off the fire and filtrate, and add again to the pure oil the succulent\r\narticles of the third addition, which have been previously triturated in\r\na mortar with wine such as I mentioned, all except the storax, for it, if\r\nadded with the other things, is straightway dissolved. And they are to be\r\nboiled upon coals until the preparation appears to be in a proper state,\r\nwhen it is to be taken off the fire and allowed to cool. Next day, having\r\nfiltrated the oil carefully, and warmed it sufficiently upon the fire,\r\nadd the wax, and when it is taken off, stir with a spatula. After it is\r\ncooled add the opobalsam, and lay it up in vessels of glass.\r\n\r\n_The gleucinum, or oil of must._ The first addition.—Of oil, sext. x;\r\nof Aminæan must, sext. vj; of rose-wood, oz. iv; of palm-branch, oz.\r\nvj; of the schœnanth, oz. vj; of melilots, oz. iv; of roses, oz. j; of\r\nmyrrh, oz. iij; of bay-leaves, oz. ij; of frankincense-tree, oz. vj; of\r\nxylobalsam, oz. vj; of elecampane, oz. vj; of long birthwort, oz. iij; of\r\niris, oz. iij. Macerate these things in the must.\r\n\r\nThe second addition.—Of Celtic nard, oz. iv; of cassamum (or sow-bread),\r\noz. ij; of cyperus, of cassia, of spikenard, of asarabacca, of amomum, of\r\ncostus, of sampsuch, of each, oz. iij; of calamus aromaticus, of cloves,\r\nof Indian leaf, of each, oz. j; of cardamom, oz. iv. Macerate in fragrant\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nThe third addition.—Of mastich, oz. iv; of troglodytic myrrh, of\r\nbdellium, of each, oz. ij; of ladanum, oz. iij; of liquid storax, of\r\nmale frankincense, of each, oz. iv; of opobalsam, oz. vj (some add also\r\nof saffron, oz. ij). Prepare like the ointment from unripe olives, except\r\nthe wax.

See also Avicenna (v, 1, 10, 11);\r\nSerapion (vii, 25); Haly Abbas (Pract. x, 19); and Mesue (De Unguentis et\r\nDe Oleis.)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of these articles for medicinal and\r\npharmaceutical purposes, we think it unnecessary to treat of them more\r\nat large, as our author’s account is sufficiently ample and accurate,\r\nand few articles of any great consequence are omitted by him. It will be\r\nremarked that most of the unguents and ointments here described are of a\r\nfragrant nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXI.—ON ŒNANTHARIA.\r\n\r\nIt is not because they contain the wild vine (œnanthe) that they are\r\ncalled œnantharia, for some of them have no wild vine at all; but it\r\nis from the wine and flower of the lilies that they have obtained this\r\nappellation. The œnantharia are used by some solely for their fragrance,\r\nand for luxury alone; these persons having them poured over their bodies\r\nafter coming out of the bath, and having their tables wiped with sponges\r\ndipped in them. But to those who use them properly, they prove remedies\r\nin cases of paralysis and syncope, if mixed with the tonic cataplasms,\r\nfor the stomach; and to convalescents more especially from febrile\r\ndiseases. They are to be poured upon the bodies of such persons, and\r\napplied to their noses if they can still inhale. For they are drawn in\r\ndeeply, and strengthen the mental and vital spirits. They are useful,\r\nlikewise, as preservatives from pestilential diseases, when the state\r\nof the atmosphere appears to be of this nature. The following is the\r\nœnantharium of Posidonius, which he calls Mesopotamenum.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the œnantharium._ Of cassia, of myrrh, of\r\nfrankincense, of Indian leaf, of amomum, of mastich, of costus, of\r\ncarpobalsam, of opobalsam, of each, oz. iij; of fatty storax, oz. iv; of\r\nfragrant Aminæan wine, x Italian sext. Having pounded and filtrated all\r\nthe things, divide the storax into small pieces, put into a vessel with\r\na broad mouth along with the leaves of lilies, dried the preceding day\r\nand stripped of their nails, placing them alternately; let the lilies be\r\n_ccc_ in number; then put in the wine and the opobalsam, which have been\r\nmixed and stirred together before their addition, and having covered up\r\nthe mouth of the vessel, expose to the sun for forty days. Use after the\r\nbath, as a restorative from disease, sprinkling the house and vessels\r\nwith it, or dipping sponges in it and applying to the face.\r\n\r\n_Another, of our own invention._ Of costus, oz. iij; of spikenard, of\r\narnabo, of cloves, of each, oz. j; of amomum, oz. iij; of cassia, of wild\r\nvine, of calamus, of each, oz. ix; of storax, of opobalsam, of each, oz.\r\niv; lilies, _ccc_; of Falernian wine, sext. x.

XXII.—ON PERFUMES AND CYPHI.\r\n\r\nIn materials the cyphi are intermediate between the trochisks which are\r\ndrunk and the antidotes. We use them sometimes in fumigations on account\r\nof their fragrance, and so also the perfumes; sometimes we smell to them,\r\nin order to concoct catarrhs and defluxions, and as deobstruents, and to\r\nclear the parts about the brain, and as preservatives from pestilential\r\ndisorders; they are also taken by the mouth for these purposes, and to\r\nconcoct matters lodged in the chest, and for cold affections in the\r\nliver: hence the ancients invented the antidotes called cyphoid. They are\r\nmixed also with compound medicines, and more especially with epithemes\r\nand antidotes.\r\n\r\n_Suffimentum rosatum, rose perfume._ Of costus, of amomum, of myrrh, of\r\ncassia, of each, oz. j; of Chian storax, of bdellium, of onyx, of moss,\r\nof ladanum, of each, dr. ij; of pure roses, oz. xxix; of opobalsam, of\r\nwine, q. s.\r\n\r\n_Suffimentum liliaceum, the perfume from lilies._ Of lilies deprived of\r\ntheir nails (i. e. the white parts of their flowers), lb. j; of primary\r\nstorax, oz. ix; of spikenard, oz. iij; of costus, of cloves, of amomum,\r\nof mastich, of burnt onyches, of honey, of each, oz. iss; of opobalsam,\r\noz. v; of wine, q. s.

XXIV.—ON PESSARIES, FROM THE WORKS OF ANTYLLUS.\r\n\r\nPessaries are applied to the womb. There are three different kinds of\r\nthem; for some are emollient, some astringent, and some are anastomative,\r\ni. e. they open the mouths of vessels. We use the emollient in\r\ninflammations of the womb, in ulceration and coldness of it, in ascension\r\nupwards, eversion and inflation thereof. They are prepared from Tuscan\r\nwax, the oil of privet and of lilies, the fat of geese and of fowls,\r\nunsalted butter, burnt rosin, stag’s marrow, fenugreek, and the like. The\r\nanastomative, or those which open the mouths of vessels, are used when\r\nwe wish to recall the menstrual purgation that has been stopped, or to\r\ncorrect the state of the womb when it is shut up or contracted. These are\r\nprepared from honey, mugwort, dittany, the juice of cabbage, liquorice,\r\nthe juice of horehound, rue, scammony, or the like. The astringent\r\nare used in cases the reverse of those for which the anastomative are\r\napplied; for they restrain the female discharge, contract the womb when\r\nit is open, and impel it upwards when prolapsed. The materials of the\r\nastringent have been already pointed out in the chapter on Collyria and\r\nTrochisks. The pessary is to be made of the thickness of bath sordes,\r\nand a little thicker; and then some wool, like a narrow tent, is to be\r\ndoubled and dipped in the medicine, and applied to the mouth of the womb,\r\nhaving a long thread attached to it to draw down the pessary readily\r\nwhen it is thought proper.—The Saffron Pessary, for inflammations,\r\neversions, hardness, and inflation of the womb: Of white wax, of calf’s\r\nmarrow, of each, dr. xvj; of stag’s marrow, dr. xj; of the grease of\r\ngeese, dr. viij; of the grease of fowls, dr. viij; of mastich, dr. iv;\r\nof the medicine œsypum, dr. iij; of honey, dr. ij; of saffron, dr. viij;\r\nof rose oil, q. s.

The pessaries of the ancients bore no resemblance to the\r\ninstruments of box-wood and other solid materials now used to prevent\r\nprolapsus of the uterus. Those of the ancients were medicated ointments\r\nor liniments, which were generally applied to the natural parts upon\r\nwool, most commonly for the purpose of correcting the menstrual\r\ndischarge. A modern authority describes them in the following terms:\r\n“Pessaries are made like a finger, of medicines for the womb, taken\r\ninto a long linen bag, well-waxed, or incorporated with honey, ladanum,\r\ngalbanum, wax and juices. They are in shape like a suppository, but\r\nlonger and thicker.” Schröder (Chym. Dispensat. p. 134). They were also\r\nfrequently resorted to for the wicked purpose of producing abortion.\r\nHippocrates, in his Oath, obligates the medical apprentice not to give\r\nsuch a pessary to a woman. Pessaries of this description consisted of\r\nstrong stimulants, such as cantharides, elaterium, colocynth, &c. The\r\nemmenagogue pessaries were formed of such-like ingredients, weakened by\r\nmixture with others of less activity.\r\n\r\nCelsus gives a very distinct account of pessaries. He says of them:\r\n“Sed alia quoque utilia sunt; ut ea, quæ fœminis subjiciuntur; πεσσους\r\nGræci vocant. Eorum hæc proprietas est: medicamenta composita molli lana\r\nexcipiuntur, eaque lana naturalibus conditur.” (v, 21.) He gives formulæ\r\nfor seven pessaries. One, for expelling the dead fœtus, consists of\r\npomegranate rind pounded with water. (v, 21.)\r\n\r\nPessaries are treated of at great length by Oribasius, Aëtius, and\r\nActuarius, and preparations are described for every imaginable condition\r\nof the uterus. Aëtius gives formulæ for pessaries to procure sterility,\r\nthe ingredients of which, for the most part, are powerful astringents\r\nand bitters. But Myrepsus is the most copious writer on this subject,\r\nfor he describes the preparation of forty-five pessaries (§ 38). Their\r\ningredients, of course, are various, according to the purpose for which\r\nthey are to be applied. The Emmenagogue consist of cumin, ginger,\r\nbirthwort, the pulp of colocynth, castor, musk, rue, &c., mixed up with\r\nwax, suet; or honey.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing original in the views of the Arabians, we need only\r\nsay with regard to them that they prepared and applied pessaries on\r\nthe principles laid down by their Grecian masters.

This is taken from a work ascribed to Galen, the authenticity\r\nof which, however, is very doubtful. Cornarius has attempted many\r\ncorrections of the text, and we have found ourselves compelled to make\r\nother alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVI.—ON WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\nThe weight is determined by the degree of heaviness; the measure by the\r\ncapacity of the vessel: but the vessel is the measure either of a dry or\r\nof a liquid quantity. So then there are three differences of a measured\r\nquantity: first, that of weight; second, that of a dry substance, and, as\r\nit were, of such things as can be heaped; and third, that of a liquid.\r\nThere being many and almost infinite varieties of weights and measures\r\naccording to the practice of places, and of those who use them, we shall\r\ntreat only of those which are familiar to all.\r\n\r\n_On the characters used by the Greeks for indicating weights and\r\nmeasures._ But since some do not indicate these by whole letters, but by\r\ncharacters, it will be better for us, in imitation of the ancients, to\r\nexplain these characters in the first place.\r\n\r\n    Transcriber’s Note: The symbols in this paragraph are included\r\n    as illustrations in the HTML version.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the letter χ having alpha placed above it, signifies\r\n_chalcus_ (i. e. _æreus_), thus [symbol]; but if the χ has ο, _chus_\r\n(i. e. _congius_), thus [symbol]; but if οι, _chœnix_, thus [symbol];\r\nbut if η, _cheme_, thus [symbol]; Κ if it has ε placed above it, and\r\na straight line obliquely intersecting the lower curvature of it\r\nindicates _ceration_ (i. e. _siliqua_), thus [symbol]; but if the Κ has\r\nυ, _cyathus_, thus [symbol] and if ο _cotyle_ (i. e. _hemina_), thus\r\n[symbol]. The circumflex line not surrounded by anything, and placed\r\naltogether obliquely, indicates _obolus_, thus 𐅼; but if there are\r\ntwo lines not surrounded, they signify two oboli, thus 𐅽, which make\r\na _gramma_ (i. e. _scrupulum_), which is indicated by γ having ρ near\r\nit, intersected by a straight line, thus [symbol]. Two lines united at\r\none extremity so as to make an angle, like the two wings which join the\r\nstraight line of the letter K, indicate _drachma_ (or _drachm_), which\r\nis synonymous with _holca_, thus [symbol]. But the _holca_ is properly\r\nindicated by λ with ο in its middle, thus [symbol]. But if the λ has ι,\r\nit indicates _libra_ (a pound), thus [symbol]. Some, however, indicate\r\na pound, by another line intersecting the line of the λ obliquely,\r\nthus [symbol]. But Γ having the letter o within its angle, signifies\r\n_uncia_ (an _ounce_), thus [symbol]. The letter μ having ν in its\r\nmiddle, indicates _mna_, or _mina_, thus [symbol]; but if the μ has\r\nυ, it indicates _mystrum_, thus [symbol]; but if ε, _medimnus_, thus\r\n[symbol]; and if ο, _modius_, thus [symbol]. The letter τ followed by a\r\nρ with a υ about it, indicates _tryblium_, thus [symbol]. The letter χ,\r\nif it has ε placed above it, indicates _xestes_ (i. e. _sextarius_), thus\r\n[symbol]. But if it has ο written above, it signifies _oxybaphum_ (i.\r\ne. _acetabulum_), thus [symbol]. Some indicate a sextarius by a χ, with\r\na straight line intersecting it, thus [symbol]. The letter η, having μ\r\nplaced above it, indicated _hemina_, thus [symbol]. The letter κ prefixed\r\nto ρ, and having μ placed above it, indicates _ceramium_, thus [symbol].\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Weights._\r\n\r\n  The Attic and Egyptian _mna_ (i. e. _mina_) contains oz. xvj.\r\n  The Roman mina                                     ”  oz. xx.\r\n  The _libra_ (i. e. _pound_)                       ”  oz. xij.\r\n  The _uncia_ (i. e. _ounce_)                      ”  dr. viij.\r\n  The _drachma_ (i. e. _drachm_)                   ”  scr. iij.\r\n  The _scrupulus_ (i. e. _scruple_)                ”  oboli ij.\r\n  The _obolus_                 contains ceratia or siliquæ iij.\r\n  The _siliqua_ contains chalci (i. e. _ærei_ or _æreoli_) ij. and ⅔.\r\n            So that an obolus contains viij æreoli.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Measures of Liquids._\r\n\r\n    The Italic _ceramium_ contains choes (or _congii_) viij.\r\n\r\n    The _chus_ or _congius_ contains sextarii vj.\r\n\r\n    The _sextarius_ contains cotylæ ij, which are also called\r\n    tryblia.\r\n\r\n    The _cotyla_, or _tryblium_, contains great mystra iij, but\r\n    acetabula iv.\r\n\r\n    The _great mystrum_ contains acetabulum j, and a third.\r\n\r\n    The _acetabulum_ contains cyathus j, and a half.\r\n\r\n    The _cyathus_ contains _small chemæ_, or _small mystra_ ij.\r\n\r\nBut if you would wish to know the measure of the weights of liquids (for\r\nthere are many differences of liquid substances according to weight),\r\nwe shall illustrate this by the example of oil, wine, and honey. Honey,\r\nthen, is heavier than wine by a fourth part, and a tenth part more, which\r\nmakes altogether almost a third part. For the same measure of honey as\r\nof wine contains the weight of the wine and a third part more. Honey is\r\nheavier than oil by one half; for it contains the whole weight of the\r\noil, and a half part of the weight besides. Wine exceeds oil by a ninth\r\npart, for it contains the whole weight of the oil and a ninth part more.\r\nIn order to make this appear more manifest, we shall subjoin, as in a\r\ndiagram, the proportion of the particular measures, it being obvious that\r\nthe words _oil_, _wine_, and _honey_, are to be understood as expressed\r\nin every line of the series.\r\n\r\n  The Italian        _Of oil._   _Of wine._          _Of honey._\r\n  Ceramium contains  lib. lxxij  lib. lxxx           lib. cviij.\r\n  Chus, or congius   lib. ix     lib. x              lib. xiiss.\r\n  Sextarius          oz. xviij   oz. xx              oz. xxvij.\r\n  Cotyle or hemina   oz. ix      oz. x               oz. xiiiss.\r\n  Great mystrum      oz. iij     oz. iij, scr. viij  oz. ivss.\r\n  Acetabulum         dr. xviij   oz. ij, scr. xij    oz. iij, scr. ix.\r\n  Cyathus            dr. xij     oz. iss, scr. iv    oz. ij, dr. ij.\r\n  Small mystrum      dr. vj      scr. xx             dr. ix.\r\n\r\nOribasius says, on the authority of Adamantius, that the Italian\r\nsextarius of wine contains oz. xxiv by measure, but lb. j oz. viij by\r\nweight; and that a sextarius of honey contains lb. iiss by weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Measures of Dry Substances._\r\n\r\n    The Egyptian _artaba_ contains modii iij.\r\n\r\n    The Egyptian and Italian _modius_ contains chœnices viij.\r\n\r\n    The _chœnix_ contains sextarii ij.\r\n\r\n    The _sextarius_ contains two semisextarii, which are called\r\n    heminæ.\r\n\r\n    The _hemina_ contains cyathi viij.\r\n\r\n    The Attic _medimnus_ contains hemiecta xij.\r\n\r\n    The _hemiecton_ contains chœnices iv. Hence the medimnus\r\n    contains modii vj, chœnices xlviij, and sextarii xcvj.\r\n\r\nBut of these it is not easy to give the weight, because of dry things the\r\ndifference, according to the inclination of the balance, is immense.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The end of the Seventh and Last Book of_ PAULUS ÆGINETA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY. See, further, Galenus (De Pond. et Mens.); Cleopatra (De\r\nP. et M.); Celsus (v, 17); Pliny (H. N. xxi, 34); Rhemnus Fannius (De\r\nPond. et Metr.); Marcellus Empiricus; Pollux (Onomast.); Hesychius et\r\nSuidas (pluries); Serapion (de Antid. vii, 37); Avicenna (v, 2, 8.) The\r\nbest modern writers on the weights and measures of the ancients are,\r\nArbuthnot (On Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures); Milligan (Præfatio\r\net Notæ in Celsum); Poucton (Métrologie); Raper (Philosoph. Transact.\r\nLondon, 1770, 1771); J. F. Wurm (De Pond. &c.); Conger (Weights,\r\nMeasures, &c. of the Greeks and Romans.)\r\n\r\nSince a proper knowledge of this subject is indispensably necessary, in\r\norder to attain a practical acquaintance with ancient pharmacy, we shall\r\nnot scruple to avail ourselves freely of the information contained in\r\nthe works of the modern authorities referred to above. It will be seen,\r\nthat in the following sketch, we have followed Arbuthnot very closely;\r\nindeed, it is proper to mention, that when we originally wrote this, our\r\nconcluding Commentary, we were not acquainted with the labours of Wurm\r\nand Conger. We now remark that, although the later authorities agree with\r\nArbuthnot on general principles, they differ from him on a few points, as\r\nwill be perceived upon a comparison of his tables with those of Conger.\r\nThe discrepance between them, we find, arises from two causes, only one\r\nof which, it will be observed, is of any practical importance. First:\r\nArbuthnot mixes the fractional with the decimal mode of computation,\r\nwhilst Conger uses the decimal method alone. Second: They give different\r\nestimates of the length of the Pes. For example, Arbuthnot states the\r\ncontents of the _ligula_ to be ¹⁄₄₈ pint, and the decimals ·117⁵⁄₁₂ solid\r\ninch; whereas Conger rates it at the decimals ·62 pint, or the decimals\r\n·69 solid inch. Now the 48th part of a pint equals the decimal ·6, which,\r\nwhen added to the former decimals ·117 solid inch, amounts to ·717: the\r\ndifference between this number and ·69 is ·027, which being multiplied\r\nsuccessively by the tabular values of the ligula, cyathus, acetabulum,\r\n&c., and the product divided by the number of solid inches in a pint,\r\ngives 12 pints, or 1 gal. 2 qts. as the difference between Arbuthnot’s\r\nand Conger’s contents of the amphora. By Arbuthnot’s table the contents\r\nof the amphora is 7 gal. 1 pint, 10·66 solid inches; by Conger’s, it is 5\r\ngal. 2 qts. 1 pint, and the decimal ·64 of a pint. For example,\r\n\r\n                        _gal._ _qts._ _pts._ _sol. inch._\r\n  Arbuthnot’s amphora =   7      0      1       10·66\r\n  Conger’s       ”    =   5      2      1\r\n                          ---------------------------\r\n             Difference   1      2      0       10·66\r\n\r\nThe Pes is the standard from which the contents of the amphora, and of\r\nthe other names of weights and measures in the table are deduced; and,\r\nas our authorities assign slightly different estimates to the length of\r\nthe pes, the other measures in the table are consequently affected by\r\nthis difference in the assumed standard. Arbuthnot assumes the pes to be\r\n11·604 inches, whereas Conger, with the later authorities, makes it to be\r\n·97075 ft. or 11·649 inches. Now the amphora, being the cube of the pes,\r\nequals, according to Arbuthnot, 1562·5112 solid inches, whereas the cube\r\nof Conger’s pes makes the amphora to contain 1580·75 solid inches.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pointed out the source of the discrepance between the tables\r\nof Arbuthnot and the later authorities, we shall now proceed with our\r\nextracts, beginning with Dr. Milligan, who, although he can have no\r\npretensions to be reckoned an original authority on the subject, has been\r\nparticularly fortunate in giving from Targa and Arbuthnot, a very lucid\r\nexposition of the weights, measures, and characters, which occur in the\r\nworks of Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from Dr. Milligan’s edition of Celsus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Characterum in Celso obvenientium Tabula._\r\n\r\n  P             = Pondo: cum aliis notis junctum quasi pondere; Anglice,\r\n                    _by weight_, significat.\r\n  P., per se    = 1 Libra.\r\n  𐆖             = 1 Denarius.\r\n  𐆐 non per se  = 1 sextantem denominationis antecedentis signat.\r\n  𐆐 per se      = fere unius drachmæ sextantem.\r\n  𐆐 𐆐           = 2 sextantis.\r\n  ⍪             = 1 sextantem.\r\n  —             = ½ sextantis.\r\n  Z             = 1 sextantem.\r\n  8             = 1 sextantem.\r\n\r\nPorro P. 𐆐, P ⍪, P Z, P 8, characteres compositi sunt, qui omnino\r\nsecundum tabulam superiorem, libræ sextantem singuli significant.

As a weight it\r\nwas the 7th part of a Roman ounce. It is from this standard that both the\r\nvalue of the Roman weights and coins are deduced.\r\n\r\nThe industrious, learned, and honest Mr. Greaves affirms that having in\r\nItaly and elsewhere perused many hundred _Denarii consulares_, he found,\r\nby frequent and exact trial, the best of them to amount to 62 grains\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe Roman ounce is certainly our avoirdupois ounce; but I must own that I\r\nhave differed in a small matter from Mr. Greaves in settling the quantity\r\nof Troy grains contained in an ounce avoirdupois. The denarius, according\r\nto my supposition, will come out 62²²⁄₄₉ grains.\r\n\r\nThat the denarius was the 7th part of the Roman ounce is clear from\r\nmultitudes of passages. Celsus (v, 17): Sed et antea sciri volo in uncia\r\npondus denariorum esse septem.\r\n\r\nCelsus divided the denarius into six parts, which he called, unciæ; uncia\r\nbeing a general word for the division of any integer. This was done\r\nin imitation of the Greek physicians, who, after the manner of their\r\ncountry, divided their drachma into 6 oboli.\r\n\r\nThe common mark of the denarius was an X or 𐆖, in imitation of which,\r\namong the Latin physicians, it grew to an *.\r\n\r\n_Of the Roman Pondo._ The pondo argenti, amongst the Romans, is a sort\r\nof numeral expression of sums of money, and is different from the common\r\nlibra which consisted only of 84 denarii, or 96 drachms, for _as_, _æs_,\r\n_pondo_, and _mina_, amongst ancient authors generally pass for the same.\r\n\r\n_Pondo_ is an indeclinable word, and when it is joined with numbers it\r\nsignifies _libra_; but when it is joined to other weights, it stands for\r\nthe same thing as σταθμῆ, or ὅλκη in the Greek, signifying the same with\r\npondus, or weight in general.\r\n\r\n_Of Roman Weights._ The Romans used the libra, which they divided into 12\r\nunciæ, or ounces, and the later Greeks, in imitation of them, had their\r\n_litra_, which they divided after the same manner.\r\n\r\nThey divided their ounce into 3 _duellæ_, and likewise into 6 _sextulæ_\r\n(sextula among the Greeks was called ἑξάγιον, and corruptly, στάιγιον).\r\nAnother division of their ounce was into 4 _sicilici_. They likewise\r\ndivided their ounce into 7 _denarii_. Then they divided it into 8\r\n_drachms_. The 12th part of an ounce they called _dimidia sextula_. It\r\nwas likewise divided into 24 _scrupula_, or rather _scriptula_, called by\r\nthe Greeks, γράμματα.\r\n\r\nThe denarius was divided into 2 _victoriati_, not only as a piece of\r\nmoney but as a weight. The denarius was also divided into 6 _sextantes_,\r\nin imitation of the 6 oboli of a drachm; according to which division a\r\n_sextans_ would contain, in English Troy weight, about 6⅓ grains. Celsus\r\nmentions the quadrans denarii and the triens denarii.\r\n\r\nThe value of the Roman pound is determined, as in the tables, from the\r\nvalue of the denarius, viz. 5245⁵⁄₇ Troy grains; according to the common\r\nreckoning it is 5256; this small difference proceeds from assuming the\r\navoirdupois ounce to the Troy ounce precisely as 51 to 56.\r\n\r\n_Greek Weights._ The _talent_ was the greatest weight as well as the\r\ngreatest sum of money among the Greeks. And this ponderal talent was\r\ndivided, as the nummary talent, into 60 _minæ_, and every mina into 100\r\n_drachmæ_.\r\n\r\nA _drachma_ was ⅛ of the ounce and ¹⁄₁₀₀ part of a mina. The Greeks used\r\nthe expression τρίτον ἡμιδράχμον to signify 2½ drachms. The old division\r\nof drachma was into 6 _oboli_.\r\n\r\nAn _obolus_ contained 6 χαλκὸι, or, as the Latins call them, _æreoli_.\r\n\r\nAn ἡμιώβολον, or _semiobolus_, contains 1 siliqua and a half, and 4\r\n_æreoli_, according to Cleopatra, but 3 only according to Diodorus (Ap.\r\nSuidam.)\r\n\r\nΧαλκὸς, or æreolus contained the 6th part of an obolus, and 7 λεπτὰ,\r\naccording to Suidas.\r\n\r\nThe Λεπτὸν was the 7th part of an æreolus, and was called by the Latins\r\n_minuta_, and sometimes _minutia_, and is not divided into any lesser\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks used the ὀυγγία, and divided it as the Romans did. They used\r\nthe κεράτιον, in Latin, _siliqua_, which was the ¹⁄₁₈ of a drachma.\r\n\r\nThe medical weights were the _mina_, of 16 Roman ounces, as appears\r\nfrom Dioscorides and Galen, and Cleopatra (in Cosmeticis) who tells you\r\nthat mina, as a weight, contains 16 ounces, 128 drachms, 384 scriptula,\r\n768 oboli, 1052 lupini, 2304 siliquæ, 6144 æreoli. But when Celsus and\r\nScribonius Largus make use of a denarius of about 62²²⁄₄₉ grains, the\r\ndrachma being supposed equal to that; 100 such drachmæ must have made a\r\nmina of 6222²²⁄₄₉ grains, whereas, a mina of 16 ounces is about 7000 Troy\r\ngrains, or our avoirdupois pound.\r\n\r\nThe physicians likewise made use of the _litra_ of 96 drachms. The\r\nὀυγγία, or uncia, being divided as usually. The κεράτιον, or _siliqua_,\r\nas mentioned before, was likewise a common weight among the physicians;\r\nand the σιτάριον, or grain, ¼ of the siliqua.\r\n\r\nThe Romans dividing their ounce into 7 _denarii_, and likewise into 8\r\n_drachms_; the Greeks of later ages dividing likewise their ounce into\r\n8 drachms, and the Roman denarius being supposed equal to the Greek\r\ndrachma, have occasioned great confusion in the expressions of authors\r\nabout the weights of both nations. It is evident there was an Attic mina\r\nof 16 Roman ounces, namely, the more ancient one, and another of 12½\r\nounces. By ounces is here meant Roman ounces, which is our avoirdupois\r\nounce. So that the most ancient _mina Attica_ was exactly our avoirdupois\r\npound. Cleopatra speaks of the two different minæ, the first of 16 and\r\nthe other of 12½ ounces. Dioscorides mentions only that of 16 ounces; and\r\nthough it is mentioned by the physicians, it is not what they prescribed\r\nby, but perhaps like our avoirdupois weight, what their gross drugs were\r\nat first bought and sold by.\r\n\r\n_Of Arabian Weights._ The Arabian weights used by their physicians,\r\nSerapion, Rhases, and Avicenna, are a mixture of the Greek and Roman\r\nweights, and derived from them. Their _manes_ is a corruption of the\r\nHebrew _maneh_, or the Greek _mina_: there were two of them, one of 20\r\nounces, and another of 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The ancient Arabian weights reduced to Troy weights._\r\n\r\n                                                         Lb.

Taking the\r\nheaviest Attic drachm, which is the 100th part of the old Attic mina,\r\nor our avoirdupois pound, and neglecting the small difference in the\r\ntables, I shall state it at 70 grains Troy. According to this drachm, the\r\nweight of the Attic χοῦς must be 50,400 grains. There are in a solid foot\r\n1728 solid inches, weighing 76 pounds of rain water: by this experiment\r\n760 grains make 3 solid inches; therefore, 50,400 make 198·94737 solid\r\ninches, the number of the solid inches in the χοῦς; which is 6 pints,\r\n25,698 solid inches, somewhat less than the Roman congius, though the\r\nGreek χοῦς and Roman congius are used indifferently as the same measure\r\nby ancient authors; as likewise are the 6th part of them, the ξέστης\r\nand sextarius, and the 12th the κοτύλη and the hemina. There is great\r\nprobability that the Greeks measured the capacity of their vessels by\r\nthe weight of oil, the product of their country. For the physicians,\r\nspeaking of these measures, always mention their weight in oil; and\r\nGalen, speaking of the cotyla, saith that Heras understood the cotyla\r\nto be of 60 drachms reducing the weight to oil. I find likewise that it\r\nis a general supposition among the ancients that the weight of oil was\r\nto that of wine, as 9 to 10; so 72 pounds of oil is made equal in bulk\r\nto 80 pounds of wine, 9 pounds of oil to 10 of wine, and so everywhere.\r\nAccording to our experiments, the weight of oil is to that of wine or\r\nfresh-water, as 476 to 527, which is very near, as 9 to 9·96. So small\r\na difference may be accounted for by the oil weighing less in a warm\r\ncountry than in ours.\r\n\r\nThe largest Greek measure for things liquid was the Attic μετρητής, which\r\ncontained 12 _choes_. It is also called ἀμφορεὺς, κάδος, κεράμιον.\r\n\r\nThe χοῦς, or χοεὺς contained 12 cotylæ. It is also called λάγυνος, or\r\nλάγυνον, λάγηνον, or lagena. The Greek physicians sometimes use χοῦς for\r\nthe Roman _congius_, the difference being but small. The Grecians in\r\nlater times borrow the ξέστης from the Roman sextarius. It was the 6th\r\npart of the χοῦς.\r\n\r\nThe Attic κοτύλη was one half of the ξέστης. It is also called τρύβλιον.\r\n\r\nThe ὀξύβαφον was a measure answering to the Roman _acetabulum_. Pliny\r\nsaith it was the 4th part of the hemina. (H. N. xv, c. ult.) Hesychius\r\nsaith it was called ἄις, ἄλις, βάφιον, and γάβενον.\r\n\r\nΚύαθος was the 12th part of the ξέστης.\r\n\r\nΚόγχη was so called from a shell. There were a greater and a less. The\r\ngreater was equal to the _oxybaphum_, and the lesser to one half of the\r\n_cyathus_.\r\n\r\nΜύστρον, or μύστλον, so called from μῦς. Of this measure there were two\r\nkinds, the greater of which was the 16th part of the cotyla, and the\r\nlesser the 4th part of the cyathus. The mystrum is called βάρβος by\r\nHesychius.\r\n\r\nΧήμη was so named from a shell-fish. There was a greater or _rustic\r\ncheme_, the 20th part of the cotyla; but the lesser, which the physicians\r\nused, was the 30th part of the cotyla.\r\n\r\nThe κοχλιάριον, in Latin, cochlear, was the smallest measure for liquids:\r\nit is equal to one half of the cheme. See the Table.\r\n\r\n_Greek Measures of things Dry._ Μέδιμνος, or μέδιμνον, was a measure\r\nfor dry things, such as wheat, barley, flour, &c., and contained 48\r\n_chœnices_.\r\n\r\nΧοῖνιξ is a dry measure containing 3 cotylæ, and so was 1½ of the ξέστης:\r\nκοτύλη, ὀξύβαφον, κύαθος, and κοχλιάριον were also used as measures for\r\nthings dry. Their capacity and proportion to one another is the same as\r\nwhen they are measures for liquids, which have been shown already.\r\n\r\n_The Roman Measures of Capacity._ The _amphora_, which contained 8\r\ncongii, was the cube of a pes, or foot. The congius itself, the cube\r\nof ½ foot. The pes being settled, as equal to 11·604 inches, its cube\r\n1562·5112, gives the contents of the amphora in solid inches; and divided\r\nby 8, gives 195·3139 inches for that of the congius.\r\n\r\nThe greatest measure among the Romans of liquid things, was the _culeus_,\r\nor _culleus_, containing 20 amphoræ. A culeus also contains 40 _urns_,\r\nthe urn being half the amphora.\r\n\r\nThe _amphora_ is otherwise called quadrantal, ceramium, cadus, and\r\nμετρητὴς Ιταλικὸς. The _urna_ is the 40th part of the culeus, and the\r\nhalf of the amphora.\r\n\r\nThe _congius_ was the 8th part of the amphora, and the 4th of the urna:\r\nit contained 6 sextarii. The congius in English measure contains 207·0676\r\nsolid inches, that is, 7 pints 4·942 solid inches.\r\n\r\nThe _sextarius urbicus_ was the 6th part of the congius. This sextarius\r\nis divided into two _heminæ_, or _cotylæ_. It is also divided into four\r\nquartarii which are the half of a hemina. A sextarius is also divided\r\ninto 8 acetabula. The parts of the sextarius were like those of the as,\r\nuncia, sextans, quadrans, triens, quincunx, semis, septunx, bes, dodrans,\r\ndextans, deunx, by which words a certain number of cyathi is meant, a\r\ncyathus being the 12th part of the sextarius. The _sextarius castrensis_\r\nwas double of the urbicus.\r\n\r\n_Hemina_, the half of the sextarius, contains 2 quartarii, 4 acetabula, 6\r\ncyathi, 24 ligulæ.\r\n\r\n_Quartarius_, as we have said, was the fourth part of the sextarius.\r\n\r\nThe _acetabulum_ was the half of the quartarius.\r\n\r\n_Cyathus_ was the 12th part of the sextarius.\r\n\r\nThe _ligula_, or _lingua_, contained one 48th of the sextarius.\r\n\r\n_Cochlear_, _cochleare_, and _cochlearium_, often denote a spoon, and\r\nsometimes a measure equal to the ligula.\r\n\r\nThere was also among the Romans a _libra mensuralis_, which the Greeks\r\ncalled λίτρα μετρικὴ, and distinguished from the λίτρα σταθμικὴ, or libra\r\nponderalis. This consisted of 12 ounces, and was divided as the _as_. It\r\nwas made commonly of horn, and divided by 12 lines, marking the ounces.\r\nThis _libra mensuralis_ weighed 10 ounces of oil, and of wine, 11 oz.\r\n2 scr., 1 obolus, and 1 siliqua, according to the ponderal libra. The\r\nancients all along supposed the weight of oil to be, to that of wine, as\r\n9 to 10. This proportion of the specific gravity of these two liquors\r\nholds in this computation; for 11 oz., 2 scr. 1 ob. 1 sil., make 1600\r\nsiliquæ; and 10 ounces make 1440 siliquæ; and dividing both by 160, makes\r\nit as 9 to 10. According to this weight of wine assigned by Galen, the\r\n_libra mensuralis_ contained 19·085 solid inches, somewhat less than ¾ of\r\nour pint, wine measure. But the Roman measures varying, in all appearance\r\nthis originally was designed to contain 12 ponderal ounces of water,\r\naccording to which weight it would be equal to 20·612 solid inches, the\r\ndifference between the two being only 1·527 solid inches.\r\n\r\n_Roman Measures of Capacity for things dry._ The _modius_ was the\r\nthird part of the _amphora_, or _quadrantal_, which was one half of\r\nthe _medimnus_. The _semimodius_ contained 8 sextarii. _Sextarius_ and\r\n_hemina_ are also measures of dry things, as so also _quartarius_,\r\n_acetabulum_, _cyathus_ and _concha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table of the Roman Measures of capacity for things Dry._\r\n\r\n                                    English Corn Measure.\r\n                                Pecks.
